   The body of former US president George Bush will “lie in state” in
   Washington, DC, and then return to Texas for burial.

   George Bush was the 41st president of the United States. (He is not to
   be confused with his son, George W. Bush, who was also a US president,
   from 2001 to 2009.)

   George Bush was president from 1989 to 1993.

Canadian Astronaut To Board ISS

   November 25, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   The International Space Station is a spacecraft that orbits the Earth;
   it is part laboratory and part home for astronauts. And soon it will
   have a new resident.
   Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques will make the journey to the ISS
   on December 3. The launch is set for 6:30 a.m. He will remain on the
   spacecraft for about six months.
   It is his first mission as an astronaut. It is the 17th space flight
   for the Canadian Astronaut Corps, according to the Canadian Space
   Agency.
   While he is on board the ISS, Saint-Jacques will conduct experiments
   and demonstrate technology.

Fires Raging In California

   November 21, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   Rain may be coming to California.

   That’s good news for the many firefighters and other helpers who have
   gathered there to fight a series of forest fires that have been burning
   in the US state for more than 11 days.

   The fires have destroyed hundreds of homes and have caused a lot of
   damage across tens of thousands of acres. Many people have had to leave
   their homes to get away from the fires.

   The Weather Channel reports that 10 to 15 centimetres (four to six
   inches) of rain are forecast for today.

   The rain will not only help the firefighters in their battle against
   the blaze, but it may also help to improve the air quality in northern
   California, according to CNN, a news service.

Mid-Term Election Puts Democrats In Control Of US House Of Representatives

   November 11, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   The House of Representatives in the United States is now controlled by
   the Democrats. The Senate remains in the control of the Republicans.
   The Democrats and Republicans are two political parties in the United
   States (groups of people with very different ideas about how the
   country should be run). US President Donald Trump is a Republican.
   On Nov. 6, the United States had a big election, called the “mid-term”
   elections. Americans vote for who they wanted to represent them in two
   main branches of their government: the House of Representatives and the
   Senate.

Man Kicked Off WestJet Flight For Being Asleep Before Takeoff

   November 4, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   A British Columbia man was made to leave a flight because he was asleep
   right before takeoff.

   Stephen Bennett, his wife, Josefa Sapelino, and their son, were taking
   a WestJet flight from Toronto, Ontario to Cuba on Oct. 13. (They had
   already flown from Burnaby, BC to Toronto.) Bennett took a sleeping
   pill which he had been given by a doctor. The flight attendants
   couldn’t easily wake him up as the plane was preparing to take off.
   They became worried there was something medically wrong with him,
   according to CTV News.

   Sapelino was eventually able to wake her husband up. That’s when he
   discovered that the flight attendants wanted him to get off the plane.

Cannabis (Pot) Now Legal In Canada

   October 21, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   On October 17, the Cannabis Act came into force and cannabis became
   legal for adults in Canada. The recreational drug, also known as
   marijuana or pot, is often smoked like a cigarette.

   It is still illegal to buy or use pot in the United States (except in
   rare cases such as for medicinal use).

   Children may not legally buy or smoke pot; it is not healthy for bodies
   and brains that are still growing. It is also illegal for anyone under
   18 years old to purchase cigarettes.

   “Protecting the health and safety of youth is a top priority,” a
   Government of Canada website states. It notes that there are “serious
   criminal penalties for those who sell or provide cannabis to youth.”

   Only adults, 19 years of age or older, may legally smoke pot. They can
   also legally buy it and grow marijuana (for their own use, not to
   sell).

Million-Dollar Banksy Painting Shreds Itself

   October 14, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   Banksy has done it again.

   Banksy is a world-famous artist, but no one knows exactly who Banksy
   is–or even if Banksy is male or female.

   That’s because Banksy is a “street artist.” Most of the art Banksy
   creates is painted on the sides of buildings, public walls and other
   places that are out in the open. And the art is created without anyone
   seeing them being created. So Banksy has remained anonymous (meaning
   that no one knows who it is).

   Banksy’s art is “political.” That means it’s not just interesting to
   look at, but it makes a point about something.

   One of Banksy’s most famous paintings is called Girl with Balloon. It
   was painted in 2002 on a wall in the UK.

   Recently, a framed copy of Girl with Balloon was auctioned off (sold)
   for nearly two million dollars.

What You Need To Know About NAFTA and USMCA

   October 10, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   A big agreement was just made between the United States, Canada and
   Mexico.
   It’s complicated–too complicated to explain fully here–but it’s good to
   have an idea about what it is and why it is important.
   Back in 1994, the US, Canada and Mexico made a deal to all become
   “trading partners.” That means, each country would partner with the
   others to make it easy to buy and sell things and services back and
   forth. That deal was called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade
   Agreement.
   When countries don’t have a deal like that, it’s sometimes hard for one
   country to sell things to another country.

Indonesia Recovering From Earthquake, Tsunami

   September 30, 2018 by Joyce Grant

   Lots of medics and emergency workers are helping people in Indonesia
   after a large earthquake happened there on Friday.

   It was a 7.5-magnitude earthquake. (That is how earthquakes are
   measured in terms of how bad they are. Seven point five is very big.)

   The earthquake also caused a tsunami. That is a massive wave of water.
   When an earthquake happens on or near a large body of water, it can
   cause huge waves and flowing water that does a lot of damage. The
   earthquake in Indonesia was along the coast, near a city called Palu,
   which is on a bay.

   Many people helped those who were affected by the disaster.
