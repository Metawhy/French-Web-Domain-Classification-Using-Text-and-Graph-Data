About Drum Kit Hardware

   Hardware packs come as standard with many beginner drum kits, but will
   have to be purchased separately when buying a higher end shell kit.
   Drum hardware is necessary for any add ons to your kit. Occasionally
   inventive drummers use the hardware percussively as well.

Hi-Hat Clutches

   Hi-Hat Clutches. Modern Hi-hat stands include a clutch. Essential for
   hi-hat functioning, a clutch controls the top-hat cymbal, whereas the
   bottom hat cymbal rests on the hi-hat stand. Hi-hat clutches have been
   developed for standard drumming, double-kick drumming and quick release
   for swift cymbal changeover. Buy yours today with a 30-day money back
   guarantee at Gear4Music!
