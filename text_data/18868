Making money in 2015 and beyond

   make money online
   Welcome to Boubouteatime! I literally forgot had this blog and earlier
   this week discovered it again in my blogspot account. I decided that
   this might be the best time to start blogging about making some extra
   cash, moola, dough, money online or whatever you like to call it. Let's
   be clear of one thing, if your not rich yet you probably can do with a
   few extra $$$ online every month. I know I won't mind making extra
   money every month. That being said from time to time I will post about
   new money making methods that I've found and that are successful.
   There are so many ways to make money out there, but finding something
   that works for you is the real challenge. If your unclear of what to do
   next, if you need just a few extra bucks and are from the US I would
   advise you start by looking into completing surveys for cash. Doing so
   can make you anywhere from $3 - $70+ depending on the length of the
   survey and your personal preferences.

Elysium Movie

   Hello everyone I decided to change my blog to a movie review blog as I
   just love to watch movies. The movie I’m going to review and summarize
   for you today is the new Elysium movie from Matt Damon. It’s bit of a
   Sci-Fi and I know that most people won’t like that but here me out the
   Elysium film is worth watching.
   The movie starts out in a typical post apocalyptic setting were the
   earth has been almost destroyed by war and famine.
   Elysium movie
   The elite and rich have left earth to move to an outer space home where
   there is no sickness or poor or any of those bad things.  The Elysium
   movie furthermore shows Matt Damon as a young worker trying to make an
   honest living in order to survive. Matt Damon then get’s radiation
   poisoning whilst working on the very robots that help protect the elite
   living on Elysium.
   Matt Damon then resorts to the extreme and tries to kidnap elite on his
   way to Elysium. It all turns terribly wrong with the Elite in the
   Elysium movie and he is killed along with Matt’s friend, the whole
   operation is total waste.
   Take a quick look at the Elysium trailer below.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvGE2nP4ga8?feature=player_embedded

   Now that you’ve taken a look at the Elysium trailer what do you think
   does it look awesome to you? Believe me the Elysium trailer isn’t
   nearly as good as the real thing.  Further more in the Elysium film
   action rises as Matt Damon is on the run from the Elysium government.
   He then gets taken to Elysium where all hell breaks loose. Watch the
   Elysium movie to find out more, I do not want to spoil the ending for
   you.
   I’ve even did some research on how to define Elysium.
   Wikipedia described it as follows: The place at the ends of the earth
   to which certain favored heroes were conveyed by the gods after death.
   Watching the Elysium film is both entertaining and keeps you on the end
   of your seat. The Elysium movie definitely is one to watch if you’re a
   fan of Matt Damon and futuristic action suspense movies.  Now I’ve even
   helped you define Elysium, now all you have to do is to is go and watch
   the movie yourself! Enjoy!

Hello to all!

   Hello everyone! I've been a bit lazy to write posts and I've actually
   been deciding what to make this new blog about. I haven't decided yet
   maybe I'll make it on dating or in French comment faire revenir son ex
    , or on how to speak French and how to pronounce French words. Till
   then thank you for waiting. You can check out my emergency numbers
   website for now.
   I'll be back with some real posts within a short while. Thanks for
   reading!
