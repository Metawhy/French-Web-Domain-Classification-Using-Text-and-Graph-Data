                  Edge won't let you read ePub e-books anymore

   By João Carrasqueira Neowin @indospot · Aug 23, 2019 13:26 EDT · Hot!
   with 39 comments

   Earlier this year, Microsoft officially removed the Books section from
   the Microsoft Store, taking away users' ability to buy new books and
   even read existing books after July. This meant that users would need
   to find a different platform to buy their books from, but at least they
   could still read them natively in Windows 10 thanks to the Edge browser
   and its support for the ePub file format.

   As it turns out, that's going away too, according to a new support page
   on Microsoft's website (via Windows Central). The company is removing
   support for the ePub file format in Microsoft Edge at some point in the
   future, though there's no clear date for when that will happen. We've
   reached out to Microsoft for more information on this, but it's likely
   that support will be dropped when the new Chromium-based version of
   Edge replaces the current UWP app. If you'd like the capability to
   return in the new version of Edge, you'll want to make that request to
   Microsoft through the Tech Community forums for the Edge Insider
   program.

   In the meantime, if you've been using the Edge browser to read books on
   your PC, there are already some apps in the Microsoft Store that might
   be able to help. Microsoft says it's worked with the DAISY Consortium
   to compile a list of apps for reading ePub books, and that those will
   be available through the Microsoft Store after next month.

   Update: Microsoft has confirmed that the end of support for this
   feature is coming with the release of the Chromium-based version of
   Edge. Since the UWP version of Edge is still included with Windows 10,
   you should be able to read ePub e-books in Edge for a while longer.

        LG unveils ThinQ voice control app for connected home appliances

   By Jay Bonggolto Neowin @@JayBonggolto · Aug 23, 2019 12:54 EDT with 0
   comments

   LG revealed earlier this year its plan to grow its voice-controlled
   smart home appliance business in 2019 after that division saw its
   all-time high operating profit at the end of 2018. The South Korean
   electronics giant is now taking another step to advance its smart home
   appliance efforts.

   LG announced today that it will be rolling out its new ThinQ mobile app
   designed to control Internet-connected home appliances by voice. It is
   meant to replace the SmartThinQ app.

   The ThinQ app will rely on Google Assistant to let you control
   Wi-Fi-connected LG appliances to perform specific tasks. Supported
   appliances include washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, ovens,
   dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, and air purifiers.

   Alice Ryu, head of LG Home Appliance & Air Solution Company’s smart
   home business, said regarding the new app:

     “Creating a smart home experience that actually makes our customers’
     lives measurably more convenient is what drives us daily. With the
     voice capable mobile app, we have created the ultimate smart home
     ecosystem that puts convenience first.”

   You can also receive product information and troubleshooting alerts via
   the app. LG says the ThinQ app will go live in South Korea later this
   month and in North America by the fourth quarter of 2019. The app is
   also slated for release in Europe next year.
