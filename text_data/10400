Help Restore Notre-Dame Cathedral

Notre-Dame Fire Restoration Fund

click here to donate

French Heritage Society is devastated by the images of Notre-Dame Cathedral
aflame and stands with so many around the world in sympathy and support.
Protecting the architectural legacy of France is at the very heart of our
mission, and we must provide whatever aid we can to this cherished monument
in a time of dire need. We have established a Notre-Dame Fire Restoration
Fund to allow those whose thoughts are with Paris to take immediate action to
ensure that the cathedral’s storied history survives.  This tragedy is an
urgent reminder of the fragility of our rare architectural treasures and the
vital work to preserve them for future generations.
