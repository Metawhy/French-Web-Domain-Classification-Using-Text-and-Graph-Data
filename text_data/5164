   Welcome to Toulouse

   The 36th International Symposium on Computer Performance, Modeling,
   Measurements and Evaluation 2018 will be held in Toulouse, France. A
   city with unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks, which
   earned it the nickname la Ville Rose ("the Pink City"). Click here to
   find out more about the city.

   The IFIP Performance conference aims to bring together researchers
   interested in understanding and improving the performance of
   communication systems by means of state-of-the-art quantitative models
   and solution techniques. The Performance conference has a long-standing
   tradition and has followed an 18-month cycle for many years. Recently,
   the interval has been changed to one year.

   Workshops
   A new feature in this year's edition of the conference are workshops on
   emerging trends and hot topics. As part of the conference program,
   there will be four half-day workshops on Cryptocurrency Analysis,
   Performance and Modeling of Energy Systems, AI in Networks, and
   Performance evaluation of satellite networks.

   The workshops will be held in the afternoon of the 6th of December, and
   attendance will be included in the registration of the main conference.
