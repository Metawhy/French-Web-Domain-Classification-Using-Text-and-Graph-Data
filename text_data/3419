Privacy and Cookie Policy

   Last updated September 2019

   Introduction

   This privacy and cookies policy ("Privacy Policy") details data used on
   www.treatwell.com and www.treatwell.co.uk (the "Websites"), the
   Treatwell Customer mobile application software and the Treatwell
   Connect (salon diary and management tool) application software and
   website at connect.treatwell.co.uk (“Connect”), both of which are
   available for download from iTunes and Google Play (the "Apps"),
   customisable websites powered by Connect hosted at unique subdomain
   addresses on mytreatwell.co.uk (the “Partner Sites”), and the web
   interfaces, also powered by Connect, embedded on Partner Sites and on
   our salon partners (“Partners”)’ own websites and social media pages,
   through which customers can make bookings directly with Partners at
   widget.treatwell.co.uk (the “Widgets”) (together, the “Platform”).

   The data controller for your information is Hotspring Ventures Limited
   (registered address: Fairfax House, 15 Fulwood Place, London, WC1V 6HU)
   ("Treatwell", "we", "our" or "us"). You can write to us at: Hotspring
   Ventures Limited, Fairfax House, 15 Fulwood Place, London WC1V 6HU or
   email us on: help@treatwell.co.uk.

   We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and customers.
   This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you how we gather, define,
   and use information that could identify you, such as your name, email
   address, address, other contact details or online identifiers, other
   information that you provide to us when using the Platform ("Personal
   Information") and also what Cookies we use. Please take a moment to
   read this Privacy Policy carefully.

   What information do we collect?

   When you visit and/or use our Platform or contact us, we may collect
   the following information:

          + Personal Information that you choose to share with us when you
            register for an account, subscribe to emails, newsletters and
            alerts and which you provide to us when using our services,
            including information entered into our booking platform and
            included in your comments, reviews or survey responses. In the
            course of making a booking or submitting reviews, you might
            voluntarily provide us with sensitive personal data if
            relevant to the service that you are requesting or reviewing
            (relating to your health or ethnicity, for example).
          + Personal Information that you share with us as part of an
            application for a job at Treatwell, submitted either directly
            on the Websites or indirectly, including but not limited to,
            via a recruitment agency, unsolicited application or
            third-party recruitment platform. In the course of making an
            application you may choose to voluntarily provide us with
            sensitive personal data relating to whether reasonable
            adjustments ought to be made for you in the application
            process or subsequently if an employment relationship is
            established. However, you must not share any sensitive
            personal data with us that would not be necessary for us to
            make reasonable adjustments for you, e.g. political opinions,
            religious beliefs or specific information on your state of
            health.
          + Where you are utilising our online payment facility, we may
            store (via ourselves or our appointed payment processor) your
            credit and debit card details on a secure encrypted basis.
          + If you choose to communicate with us (for example, through the
            Platform, live chat, email, telephone, SMS, or social media)
            we will record the fact that you have contacted us, the
            content of your and our communication, your contact details,
            and other unique identifiers including IP address and display
            name.
          + Information about your visits to and use of the Platform, such
            as information about the device and browser you are using,
            your IP address and location, your identifier for advertisers
            (IDFA), the date and time that you visited, the duration of
            your visit, the referral source and website navigation paths
            of your visit and your interactions on the Platform including
            the salons and treatments you are interested in. Please note
            that we may associate this information with your Treatwell
            account. Please see the cookies section of this Privacy Policy
            for further information on the purposes for which we collect
            and use this information.

   It is important that all the Personal Information you give us when you
   register as a user or otherwise when you use the Platform is correct
   and accurate. This includes, by way of example only, ensuring that we
   have your correct contact (including email) details at all times.

   If you plan to submit someone else's Personal Information to us, for
   instance when making a booking on their behalf, you should only provide
   us with that third party's details with their consent and after they
   have been given access to information about how we will use their
   details, including the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

   Protecting your personal information

   The transmission of information via the internet is not completely
   secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect your Personal
   Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted
   to our Platform. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have
   received your Personal Information we will use strict procedures and
   security features in relation to that data.

   How do we use your personal information?

   In general terms, we use Personal Information to provide you with the
   services and products you request, process payment, provide customer
   services, deliver our content and ads which we think may be of interest
   to you, for customer research, to send you marketing and promotional
   emails and to notify you about important changes to our Platform.

   We also use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

          + To fulfil a contract, or take steps linked to a contract. This
            is relevant where you request a service via Treatwell. This

   Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing

   Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw

   cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent,
   where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right
   to opt-out of direct marketing at any time. You can do this by
   following the instructions in the communication where this is an
   electronic message, or by contacting us using the details set out
   below.

            allow 48 business hours for your email address to be removed
            from our system.
          + If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving communications
            which are sent by Partners and other third parties, please
            contact the Partner or third party directly. In the case of

   Your rights in relation to your personal information

   In relation to the personal information we hold about you, you may be
   entitled to ask us:

          + For a copy of your personal information
          + To correct, erase or restrict the processing of your personal
            information

            the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or

   In the first instance you may be able to view or change the information
   you have provided us with by logging in to your online account.

   Your rights in relation to your personal information are limited in

   right to make a complaint if you feel your personal information has
   been mishandled. We encourage you to come to us in the first instance

          around our Platform and use our features, for system
          administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, to keep you
          logged in from one page to another or so that we can remember
          what you have added to your basket. These cookies cannot be
          switched off as our Platform cannot function properly without
          them.

                Examples:

                ITKT / ATKT - Keep you logged in as you move around the

          choices you make such as the country you visit our Platform
          from, language, search parameters such as date, area or
          treatment, and help to identify issues with our Platform (such
          as crash incidents). These can then be used to provide you with
          an experience more appropriate to your selections and to tailor
          and enhance your visits to our Platform. The information these
          technologies collect may be personally identifiable, such as
          your log-in details. They cannot track your browsing activity on
          other websites or apps outside the Platform. We use some tools
          for this purpose, for example Snowplow.

          how many users visit our Platform, how users arrive at, and
          browse or use our Platform and which parts of our Platform are

                adverts on our behalf and Awin uses Cookies to analyse the
                performance of these adverts and to enable us to process

          + Targeting or Advertising Purposes

          Using Cookies for this purpose enables us to display adverts on

          browsing habits and usage of the Platform in order to make
          adverts more relevant and personalised to you and your
          interests. We may use remarketing technologies to enable third
          parties to display relevant and personalised ads to you through
          their networks. They are also used to identify that you have
          seen a particular advert, limit the number of times you see an
          advert as well as help measure the effectiveness of an

Treatment Guide

   Compelled to delve deeper into the world of beauty? Then hit our expert
   guides. They're everything you need to choose your ultimate treatments.
   Go bold, go confident.

   [v2.i1151918.w688.h458.x653B0025.jpeg]

Body

   From tanning to exfoliation treatments, mud wraps to massages, if
   you're looking to treat your body to some serious pampering, booking
   into a beauty salon is the first step in your journey to utter
   relaxation.
   [v2.i1151955.w688.h458.xD05D1AB3.jpeg]

Face

   If you're searching for the perfect facial, many beauty salons offer a
   range of treatments that cater to your complexion. Filled with expertly
   trained staff to get to the bottom of any skin issue, booking in for a
   facial is an important first step to getting your skin back on track.
   [v2.i1153272.w688.h458.x937D880C.jpeg]

Hair

   Hair salons come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Whether you prefer
   to splurge on regular hair appointments or like to chop and change to
   suit your location and your budget, one thing is for certain - we all
   need a good trim every so often and a hair salon is the place to do it.
   [v2.i1153275.w688.h458.xC300F055.jpeg]

Hair removal

   Do you know your Brazilian from your Hollywood wax? Or the best way to
   rid your body of unwanted hair for good? Whether you're looking for
   long-term results or are content with your monthly wax sessions, a hair
   removal salon will cater to all your body hair needs under one roof.
   [v2.i1153409.w688.h458.xE24872CD.jpeg]

Massage

   Tense, tight, muscles call for a massage. In the right hands your aches
   and pains can be massaged away within minutes. If you can’t seem to
   kick sore shoulders and aching joints, you need to get yourself to a
   massage salon, asap.
   [v2.i1153406.w688.h458.xB6B904ED.jpeg]

Nails

   Nail bars are the best. Go in feeling drab and un-groomed and come out
   looking like a million dollars. Yes, whether it's a quick shape and
   tidy, a full on set of gel nails or a bold, acrylic mani, nail salons
   have the power to transform your nails, and lift your mood!

Where to go? What to choose?

   [v2.i759436.w688.h488.x89E6782E.jpeg]

Barbershop

   Are you a dapper gent who takes his personal grooming pretty seriously?
   Then the barbershop is perfect pitstop for you. From wet shaves to a
   good old fashioned haircut, barbershops offer a wide selection of
   treatments for the man who takes pride in his appearance.
   [v2.i759437.w688.h533.xC3C4551D.jpeg]

Beauty Salon

   A beauty salon is your one stop shop for all things pampering,
   beautifying and grooming. You'll find everything from facials to spray
   tans to lash extensions and even a spot of nail art. And it's not just
   for the girls. Most beauty salons welcome men with open arms.
   [v2.i797739.w688.h547.x2DCBA7C1.jpeg]

Brow Bar

   Never been to a brow bar? You don't know what you're missing. Get
   waxed, plucked, threaded and tinted to perfection by a professional
   brow artist and you'll never go back to DIY again. Most brows bars also
   tend to you lashes so you can book in for both at the same time.
   [v2.i759438.w688.h457.x8069CBF2.jpeg]

Skin Clinic

   Whether you suffer from stubborn acne, have a recurring skin condition
   or simply want to set yourself up with a personalised skincare regime,
   a professional skin clinic should be your first stop on the road to a
   flawless, healthy complexion.

   full or part payment for all purchasable treatments and stays, but
   cannot be used to purchase more Gift Cards. If your treatment costs
   more than the value of the Gift Card, you can pay the additional amount
   at checkout. Similarly, if you don’t want to spend the whole gift at
   once, the remaining balance will stay in your Treatwell Wallet.

How do I spend my Gift Card?

   Recipients can enter the code in the special field at the checkout when
   making a purchase. They will then be asked to create a Treatwell
   account so they do not lose any remaining credit.

How long will my Gift Card be valid for?

   Your Gift Card balance will remain valid for twelve months after the
   date of purchase. The exact expiry date will be included in the Gift
   Card email itself. If you have added the card to an account, you will
   also be able to see when your balance is due to expire when you log in
   and visit the My Wallet section of your profile.

When will my Gift Card arrive?

   Gift Cards sent via email should arrive in your chosen inbox instantly.
   Physical Gift Cards are sent 1st Class via Royal Mail. This means that
   your postal order should be delivered within 2-3 working days
   (excluding weekends and Bank Holidays).

   For physical Gift Card purchases above £150 in value, we will send via
   Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1pm™ as long as your order is
   placed before noon (excluding weekends and Bank Holidays). Please note,
   this service requires a signature on arrival. If you do not wish for
   your gift card to be sent via Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed by
   1pm™ please email help@treatwell.co.uk.

   If your Gift Card does not arrive, please email help@treatwell.co.uk.

I need to cancel my Gift Card purchase - what should I do?

   We offer a 14 day return policy on all Gift Cards, during which you can
   cancel your purchase, provided it hasn’t yet been added to a Treatwell
   account. So if you have accidentally purchased too many Gift Cards or
   no longer wish to proceed with your order, please get in touch with our
   Customer Experience team on help@treatwell.co.uk.
   Booking is easier on our app.
