   Before Segment

   Each tool that your team uses needs to be integrated separately,
   creating redundant code and unnecessary work for your engineering team.

   After Segment

   Segment breaks down customer data to its core component parts and
   abstracts away integration code. We automate redundant work so you can
   get back to shipping product and delighting customers.

   you to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat
   areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.). Please be aware that

   and restrict that individual from future access to the Service.

   organization, that organization is the administrator of the Service and
   we act only as its service provider. We are not responsible for the
   privacy or security practices of these organizations, which have their
   own privacy policies, and we encourage you to contact them with your
   privacy-related questions or requests to access, correct or delete your

Privacy Shield Notice

   Effective as of July 18, 2018.

   Segment.io, Inc. (“Segment“ or “we“, “us“ or “our“) complies with the
   EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
   Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the
   collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred to it in
   the United States from the European Economic Area (“EEA“) or
   Switzerland, respectively. We have certified to the Department of
   Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more
   about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to
   view our certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.

   Scope. Our certification of adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles
   applies to the personal data that (a) we collect from our customers and
   other visitors to our website for account management, billing or
   marketing purposes (“Segment User Data“) and (b) that we process on
   behalf of our customers in providing online services to them under a
   service agreement (“Services Data“).

   Data processed. The Segment User Data that we collect, use and share is
   described in our Privacy Policy. While our customers decide what
   Services Data to submit, it typically includes information about their
   own users and how they use the customer’s sites, applications and
   services and third party applications. We process Services Data as
   instructed by our customers and do not own or control Services Data.

   Purposes of data processing. We collect, use and share Segment User
   Data for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy. We process
   Services Data for the purpose of providing our online services to our
   customers, which may include accessing and processing the data to
   provide the services, to correct and address technical or service
   problems, to follow instructions of the customer who submitted the
   data, or in response to contractual requirements.

   Inquiries and complaints. If you believe Segment maintains your
   personal data within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, you
   may direct any inquiries or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield
   compliance to privacy@segment.com. If you are located in the EEA or
   Switzerland and have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we
   have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third
   party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
   https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

   Arbitration. If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and neither
   Segment nor our dispute resolution provider resolves your complaint,
   you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration under certain
   conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield website.

   Third parties who may receive personal data. We share Segment User Data
   with third parties as described in our Privacy Policy. We may share
   Services Data with third parties under the following circumstances and
   only in accordance with the applicable customer agreements:
     * Affiliates. We may disclose Services Data to our subsidiaries and
       corporate affiliates for use consistent with this Privacy Policy.
     * Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and
       individuals to administer and provide the Service on our behalf
       (such as customer support, hosting, website analytics, email
       delivery, database management services). Segment maintains
       contracts with these service providers restricting their access,
       use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Privacy
       Shield obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and
       we may be liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are
       responsible for the event giving rise to damage.
     * Legal requirements. We may disclose Services Data if required to do
       so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or
       request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency, or in
       the good faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to comply
       with a legal obligation, (b) to protect or defend our rights,
       interests or property or that of third parties, (c) to prevent or
       investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the services,
       (d) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
       of customers, their users or the public; or (e) to protect against
       legal liability.
     * Business Transfers. As we develop our business, we might sell or
       buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
       reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Services Data may be
       part of the transferred assets.

   In addition, we may be required to disclose any personal data that we
   process in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including
   to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

   Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure.
   Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland have rights to access personal
   data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal
   data. With our Privacy Shield self-certification, we have committed to
   respect those rights. We process Services Data only on behalf of our
   customers in accordance with their instructions. This means that if you
   wish to access Services Data and request that we correct, amend or
   delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy
   Shield, you should contact that customer with your request. We will
   then help them to fulfill that request in accordance with their
   instructions.

   If your personal data includes Segment Personal Data, you can request
   access to that data and request that we correct amend, or delete it if
   it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy Shield by
   emailing your request to privacy@segment.com. We may request specific
   information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your
   request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your
   request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to
   legal restrictions.

   U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement. Segment’s commitments under
   the Privacy Shield are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of
   the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
   If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Shield
   Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles
   shall take precedence.
