Photography

What’s a great all around camera that I can use for travel and everyday life?

   One of our most common questions we receive is regarding camera
   recommendations. To be honest, we often tell people to get the newest
   iPhone if their budget is under $1000. The cameras on these phones just
   keep getting better and better and you’ll always have your phone on
   you. The larger iPhone 7+ has two lenses with one being a telephoto
   that’s great for those things a bit further away. If you are willing to
   spend over $1500 the Sony a7II and the Fujifilm Xt2 come highly
   recommended. If you are looking for a professional level camera and
   need further advice, feel free to email us at [email protected], we’d
   be happy to help.

   FAQ

Photography

What kind of camera and lenses do you use?

   We have two types of cameras that we use for 95% of our photos. We use
   a Leica MP 240 which is a manual focus rangefinder camera for all of
   our outfit shots on the blog. Most photos are taken with a Leica 35mm
   1.4 lens with the remaining coming from either a 28mm lens or a 50mm
   lens. Thomas uses that camera. For flatlays and some travel shots, I
   shoot on a Sony RXRII, which is a professional level point and shoot.
   I’m also taking more and more photos just on my iPhone. The quality of
   the images just keep getting better and there’s no easier camera to
   use.
   In the past, we’ve owned a Canon 5D Mark III, Leica Q and Leica SL.

Photography

Do you have any tips for shooting great photos?

   At its roots, photography is all about lighting and composition. When
   you decide to take a photo, think about how you can make the lighting
   better. Small adjustments like moving your subject closer to an open
   window for brighter light or shading your food by blocking light with
   your body can create more even light that’s more pleasing. Once you’ve
   figured out your light, think about your composition. Composition is
   the arrangement of visual elements in a picture. It’s not just how the
   physical elements are arranged but also the distance from the subjects,
   the angle and the focal length of the lens. Composition is all about
   experimentation. I’ve never taken just one picture, I always play
   around with the composition, moving items in the photo, changing the
   distance or the angle. Afterwards, I review all of the images and
   select the ones I find the most visually appealing or tell the best
   story. I then edit those.

Beauty

What are your go-to beauty supplies?

   I shared my five most-used makeup products in this post
   http://galmeetsglam.com/2016/08/five-favorite-makeup-products/

   As well as my updated makeup routine here:

   For more beauty recommendations and tips, you can read my posts in the
   Beauty Category.

Beauty

Your hair looks so healthy. What kind of products and tools do you use for
it?

   For styling, I use this 1 ¼ Inch Curling Iron. I also did a hair
   curling tutorial with it here. I try to avoid blow drying my hair as
   much as possible but when I do I use my T3 Blowdryer. For my tips on
   products for healthy hair you can read this post, and if you are
   interested in where I get done my hair done, you can check out an
   interview I did with my hairstylist here.

I’m visiting San Francisco! Do you have any recommendations of places to eat
and things to do?

   Yes! Please check out the posts I’ve done here and here.

Travel

I am going on a trip soon. What advice would you give me?

   We could put together 100 tips for traveling, but I think the most
   important thing to remember when traveling is why you’re traveling in
   the first place. No matter what stage you are in, you can be in the
   planning stage or you could already be on your trip, the purpose of
   your trip should always be top of mind. Here’s why, when we travel, we
   are presented with a plethora of options. The sheer amount of things to
   do, places to stay and food to eat can be overwhelming. This combined
   with the ticking clock of our time expiring creates a perception of
   scarcity and can force us into a rush to consume everything. So the
   next time you plan a trip, make sure most of your itinerary reflects
   your purpose and I’m sure you’ll have a wonderful time.

How did you and Thomas Meet?

   Thomas and I met in college. Our Grandparents are close friends.
   Despite their best efforts to hook us up when we were younger, we
   didn’t meet until we were introduced by friends that were dating.
   Thomas was on the baseball team and I was on the dance team. We had
   teammates and close friends that were dating and they brought us along
   on a double date and we hit it off from there. We’ve been inseparable
   ever since.

   [gmg-meal-prepping-1009122.jpg]

   I rarely talk about food on Gal Meets Glam and that has been a
   strategic choice I’ve made. I’ve focused very intently on fashion,
   travel, beauty and occasionally more about me personally. I’m not an
   expert chef, hence why I don’t talk about recipes. I love food, but as
   an extremely busy person I’ve found that food has made me more and more
   frustrated. It becomes an afterthought to my busy lifestyle and without
   a plan it’s not until I’m riddled with hunger pains or I start to get
   hangry that I’m reminded about eating. This last second panic eating
   rarely ever leads to healthy choices, either we eat out too often or I
   default to eating bars or other packaged foods. So in an effort to feel
   better about what I was eating every day Thomas and I decided to be
   more proactive with our meal planning by starting to do meal prepping.
   We started two Sundays ago and I’m happy to report that we are loving
   it so far.


   For those that don’t know, meal prepping is all about arranging your
   meals so that they are cooked in advance and stored to be consumed over
   the next couple of days. If well planned, you can use the same base of
   ingredients to create wide ranges of tasty meals. Based on our
   research, most pre-cooked foods keep for about 3-4 days. So about twice
   a week, dedicated meal preparers will have prep days where they cook
   all of their food.


   Meal Prep List
   Meal prep containers


What We Love About Meal Prepping


   I’m loving that food is becoming less of a stress on my life. So far
   I’ve noticed I’ve been more energetic throughout the day, especially in
   the middle of the day, because I have breakfast and lunch on time. With
   that, I’ve cut down significantly on snacking. I also love how good the
   food is and that I know what ingredients are in my food. Thomas loves
   that he gets to cook so much on the prep days but also has nights off
   from cooking when he doesn’t feel like it or has too much work. And I
   especially appreciate having a cleaner kitchen more often than not,
   though our kitchen on Sunday’s looks like a tornado ran through it.


What We’ve Learned So Far


   The prep and cooking days can be exhausting- Well not as much for me
   but for Thomas. He has spent about 4 hours on both Sundays cooking and
   cleaning.


   You have to go to the grocery store with a list- When you’re meal
   prepping there’s no more walking into the grocery store without a
   shopping list. We start with a standard list which is super helpful and
   we are refining it each time we go with additions and subtractions to
   the list.


   Make a few versatile sauces that you can continuously use- Good,
   homemade sauces are an underutilized tool for most home chefs,
   especially if you aren’t the best chef in the world. We decided that
   sauces would be a great way to change up the flavor while eating the
   same foods over the course of a week. When we cooked anything we’d
   simply use salt and pepper and then apply the sauce closer eating. We
   started with two sauces, this vegan Tzatziki and a Lemon Tahini.


   Swap out your Tupperware for Meal Prep Containers and these cute Bento
   Boxes–  These stackable and reusable glass containers are great for
   holding lots of pre-cooked food and if you buy the right ones you can
   even take off the lid and reheat the same container in the oven or
   microwave. One tip we got from a reader was to hand wash the plastic
   lids as they may shrink from the heat in the dishwasher. I also bought
   a few of these bento boxes for assembling my lunches in to take to
   work.


   Get the most out of a hot charcoal grill or oven- Thomas has an XL Big
   Green Egg which can be a little overkill when cooking for two but it’s
   been incredible for cooking lots of food at once. If using an oven it
   might be a good time to update your bakeware, we have a few of these
   sheet pans which Thomas uses all of the time.


   We love our pressure cooker- I know these last couple of months there’s
   been a craze about the Instapot. We bought our pressure cooker/slow
   cooker combo about 2 years ago. We love that it cooks things faster but
   it also imparts more flavor. We use it mostly for rice, beans and
   soups.


What We Are Still Learning


   It’s hard without a microwave- We don’t have a microwave and don’t want
   one so this makes reheating food (if desired) an extra chore. We’ve
   reheated some items by placing in the oven or cooking them lightly on
   the stovetop.


   It’s hard to balancing the right amount of food to buy- It’s always
   annoying how much food goes to waste after buying groceries. I’m sure
   most people are much better than we are (it’s hard with travel) but one
   of our goals with meal prepping is creating less waste. It’s easy to
   get excited on prep day and cook too much food only to never eat it
   all.


   Do we fully prep each meal ahead of time or just pre-cook and store
   leaving the meal decision up to how we are feeling in the moment?- To
   us, it’s weird to decide exactly what we will eat for every meal
   without considering how we are feeling in the moment. But I’m sure the
   largest savings is from assembling meals in advance. I could always use
   each night before bed to assemble the next days meals as much as
   possible, especially lunch which I’m really bad at bringing to work.


   We are really excited to giving meal prep a go. Even if we adopt it for
   half the week, we are still making improvements. Is this something you
   would want to fit into your life? Maybe you already have. What are your
   biggest struggles with cooking food at home? Have you tried meal
   prepping and had success? What tips might you have? I’d love to hear
   from you.

       I definitely feel that mealprepping would reduce stress and
       unnecessary anxiety about having the time to make and enjoy food.
       Thank you so much for such and interesting and inspiring post! :)

       Going to the store with a list is so important for me! The first
       time I tried meal prepping, I tried to keep everything in my head
       and make it up as I went along and it wasn’t great! Definitely
       important to prep a list before prepping a meal :)

       I am doing Whole30 and part of the plan I’m following involves meal
       prep. I hated meal planning because I never knew if I’d want the
       meal when it came time to eat, but I’m doing better at just eating
       it. Instead, meal planning and prepping has decreased my stress and
       effort throughout the week. If I have an exhausting day, or if I
       feel unwell, there was a time when I would just order out, which
       wouldn’t help me gain energy or feel better. With this I’m spending
       less time on meals than i used to! It’s great!

       This is so interesting! I’ve tried to prep my meals a few times but
       I get worried that things won’t last. Luckily we do have a
       microwave and that helps but I completely get what you mean about
       heating things up because I didn’t have one a few months ago and it
       felt like it was more hassle. I think even making sandwiches helps
       massively with time and money!

       I started meal prepping when I was loosing weight post-partum
       through a nutrition coach. I highly recommend brining meat and the
       use of a sous vide. One of the hardest parts about meal prep, in
       addition to the time it takes, is how dry meat can be when
       re-heated. Brining imparts a lovely juicyness to meat that is even
       better when cooked via sous vide. The best part is, the meat
       re-heats very nicely. Sous vide is easy and requires minimal time
       input. You can sear it on the grill after if you choose. We also
       have a big green egg but it’s mostly used for home-smoked bacon!

       My husband and I started doing this recently and love it! Agreed
       that it could be difficult without a microwave – and it is
       incredibly time consuming for the chef (my husband is the cook as
       well ;). I’ve found that if I make sure to do all of the cleaning –
       and help him clean as he moves about, it’s a less arduous task for
       him. Sounds simple, but it has been SO helpful. If you find any
       good recipes pass them along! I would love to exchange xx

       I love this – my husband and I are big on meal prep. We tend to
       pick out recipes for the week based on how many dinners we will be
       eating in. Then, we go to the grocery store with a list on Sunday.
       Each night when we cook, we aim to make bigger or double portions
       so that we have enough to take as leftovers the following day for
       lunch. Those bento boxes are so cute!

       I’ve always told myself that I need to get into meal prepping, but
       I don’t think I could hack 4 hours of cooking and cleaning for it
       on the Sunday! Thanks for the great review of the process, Julia!
       I’ve really enjoyed reading both sides!
       I hope you’ve had a great Tuesday so far,

       We do Purple Carrot TB12 meals during the week. It’s three meals to
       prep and cook that are all vegan and gluten free. They typically
       take under 30mins and it’s always a nice variety of new recipes.
       It’s definitely made weeknight cooking better! We also order
       groceries online via Foodkick (we’re in Manhattan) Sunday mornings
       for the remaining weeknights we’ll be home. Highly recommend this
       too if it’s an option in your area! x

       I do this too! So healthy for the body and the wallet! Investing in
       many glass containers and tossing my plastic ones is one of the
       purchases I’m most happy with. To save time for myself, on Sundays
       I go to my local organic grocery and buy seasoned already-cooked
       chicken breasts from the deli instead of making them myself. Then I
       make a big batch of brown rice for the week, cut up tons of
       veggies, and mix spinach into each of my meals. I too have noticed
       a big boost in energy in the afternoon that carries me through to
       dinner.

       Don’t prep! I travel loads and buy a weekly meat and a weekly veg
       box. Its a surprise what turns up so I always have to find a way/ a
       new recipe of cooking something each night. There is no waste as
       the boxes are just right for two people. Plus they come from a
       farm, are organic and there is no grocery shopping as they are
       delivered :)

       Hi! I tried meal prepping but as you said, it’s exausting cooking
       so many hours on a sunday! So now I don’t do it: instead, I plan
       all the meals for the week so I can shop accordingly and choose
       recipes that don’t require more than 30 minutes to cook. I would
       rather spend 30 minutes each day than a whole afternoon on the
       weekend. I take advantage of frozen or pre chopped vegetables to
       save time and always cook extra so I can have leftovers for lunch.
       Good luck and congratulations on your blog!

       I’ve been thinking about meal prepping as well and it is hard to
       decide how much food to buy. I also get sick of eating the same
       food all the time. I like the idea of having different sauces!

       Interesting idea! I haven’t tried prepping our meals in advance,
       but since late last year I’ve been making an effort to do meal
       planning in advance which helps SO much. I realized I was really
       overspending at the supermarket by not planning ahead and making so
       many extra trips to pick up random ingredients, and then always
       ending up with more…So now on Saturdays, I make a list of the
       dinner options for the week, then a list of the ingredients that I
       need and try to stick to it. I actually like cooking, although it
       can get a little tiring every day, but this also keeps things
       somewhat flexible so that I can decide that evening what meal I’ll
       make from my menu based on how I’m feeling :)

       I meal prep with the 21 Day Fix containers! You can buy generic
       ones on Amazon, but they are color coded by food type (fruits,
       vegetabls, protein, fat, etc.) and different sizes based on serving
       size. You get a certain amount of containers each day based on a
       calculation to the number of calories you are supposed to consume
       per day. It takes a little more effort planning out (I use a weekly
       calendar template from Google) but it is very helpful so I know I
       am getting the right amount of food and they are already
       pre-portioned!

       I really recommend a book called “the roasting tin”. It’s not meal
       prep per se but makes cooking dinner less work and less cleaning as
       it’s just one dish you use, and the recipes make enough for lunch
       the next day. Lots of veggies and supergrains and uncomplicated
       meals.

       Great post, food is always a good topic as it’s one of our major
       necessities😉! If you’re not in the mood to meal prep for all week,
       at least do some more food for dinner so you can pack the rest and
       take it next day to work for lunch. That was my method for a year
       when next to the winery I worked, there was no store within
       10miles. Even if you’re eating out for dinner, ask the waitress to
       pack up the leftovers and you’ll appreciate it for lunch :)

       We have been meal prepping for a year now and LOVE it! It helped us
       save so much extra money on our recent trip to Ireland and eat a
       lot healthier. My favorite is taco bowls. I use vegetarian meat or
       turkey that I cook and flavor in our crock pot with cumin, cayenne
       pepper, garlic powder and cilantro and then wrap up the cheese,
       olives, diced tomatoes and lettuce separately. I dump it all in a
       bowl at work! We also go to our local organic, farm-raised store
       every Sunday for whichever meat & veggies look best and then get
       creative every time from there. Keeps it new and exciting.

       meal prepping is tough! I’ve found that there are only a few kinds
       of food that I truly enjoy reheating over and over. Typically what
       I do now is cook batches of protein and carbs in advance and
       portion out fresh veggie for the week, without cooking them though
       – I can’t do reheated veggies! I’ve also turned to eating more raw
       veggies as a result.
       I love mexican-inspired foods, so what I typically do is make a big
       batch of rice and beans (and any other protein, like chicken) and
       portion them out for three or so days. Then when its time to eat I
       grab my container of base foods and add fresh/raw kale and peppers
       and top it off with salsa and avocado!

       I suggest trying cauliflower rice instead of brown rice if you
       haven’t yet; you can’t tell the difference. If there’s a Trader
       Joe’s near you, they sell it fresh and frozen. It’s really good,
       and is a small change for a better nutritional value. The only
       thing is that you can’t stretch it out past a week because it
       doesn’t last. Just a suggestion!

       It definitely gets easier as you go! I like stashing one or two
       servings of meals we cook in the freezer (soup freezes great!) so
       once a week we usually have a “freezer meal” from our stash. It’s
       one less to prep and with a few weeks between we don’t tire of the
       same meals over and over.

       what we have found to work best for my boyfriend and me is to meal
       prep breakfast and lunches for the week, which is the bulk of the
       work. Then cook a dinner that serves (4) a few times a weeks so you
       can have leftovers the next night. Depending on our schedule, we
       will cook (2) to (3) different dinners. This helps break up the
       monotony of eating the same thing all week and still cuts back on
       the number of times you have to cook. Leftover nights are always my
       favorite — no cooking and the meals always seem to taste even
       better!

       My personal approach to meal prepping has been cooking double
       batches of whatever I’m making for dinner. Then I pack my lunch for
       the next day. I tend to do this every night and it works well,
       since I’m already planning to cook a new meal most nights.
       I’m glad this is working well for you!

       I love prepping fully-cooking meals for grab-and-go, but it’s also
       a great idea to prep some of your bases/proteins etc. so you can
       assemble a “impromptu” meal when you don’t feel like another bowl
       of vegan chili. I got into meal prep by following Nutrition
       Stripped about 2 years ago and never looked back – she has great
       resources, and her cookbook is beautiful!

       I meal prep for my fiance and I and have for the last 4 years now.
       We do it a bit differently in that I don’t use one day to prep
       everything, more like one full day at a time. I have the bulk
       choices for breakfast and snacks selected and ready over the
       weekend, but then I prepare that evening’s dinner which then
       doubles as the following day’s lunch. As breakfast has been chosen
       and made, it means I’m only having to cook one single meal a day,
       which has been predetermined over the weekend with ingredients and
       my food list. In this way, as we both work full time and are in
       school, if we choose to go out or do something different, the
       planned meal just gets pushed off by one day and we don’t waste
       anything the same way. Like you and Thomas, we likewise work
       together so it’s easy for us to share meals and snacks. Good luck
       with your prepping endeavors! It has made a HUGE difference in our
       lives as far as time, planning, weight-loss, and overall general
       health.

       Hi Julia! Great post- I think it’s great to bring up a topic I’m
       positive a lot of people struggle with. I’m sure you’ve heard of
       Tone It Up? Incredible women with an incredible outlook on health
       and fitness. I live by their workouts, but their nutrition plan is
       pretty legit. It really taught me the ins and outs of meal
       prepping. They provide grocery lists and more recipes then you
       could ever dream of making. Their muffins- wow. So delicious!!!
       What I love about their recipes is that they don’t take a long
       time! I’m glad you pointed that out too- meal prep is time
       consuming! Not promoting Tone It Up or anything, just wanted to
       share that they have a lot of great tips for meal prep on their
       website.

       Hi Julia! I also recently started meal prepping and found that it
       saves me time, stress, hangry moments AND excess calories! I travel
       a lot for work as well so I feel your pain on wasting and going out
       to eat. If you’re only in town for another day, is it worth going
       to the grocery store? The only problem with meal prepping is that I
       find myself getting into a rut. For me, it’s usually grilled
       chicken, butternut squash and broccoli or spaghetti squash and
       turkey meatballs, or taco bowls. I need more inspiration. Where do
       you get your inspiration from?

       Love this!! As an avid meal prep-er, you guys are definitely
       crushing it so far! My favorite tip to reduce waste is to pick
       recipes with overlapping fresh ingredients. You would do this at
       the list-making part of the process, and ensure that if you get
       something like cilantro (always a big bunch, and doesn’t last more
       than 5-6 days!) is included in 2-3 meals to use as much as
       possible, like in fish tacos with mango salsa and turkey burgers
       topped with guacamole! Or when I have a big bunch of kale, I’ll use
       it in a salad one night (shredded and combined with radicchio and
       an easy lemon-miso dressing, maybe some parm), as a roasted side
       dish another (add in some shredded brussels, garlic, and shallot),
       and also whip up some kale chips for a snack(fave recipe for these
       by Minimalist Baker:
       https://minimalistbaker.com/30-minute-cheesy-kale-chips/). While
       some fresh ingredients can be frozen to reduce waste, I always find
       they taste the BEST fresh and pick a few different ones each week
       to add in to different recipes! It’s a simple tip, but really helps
       me think more about the recipes I am picking out and how they mesh
       with my shopping list and total food purchased for the week! Hope
       this is helpful, and good luck as you both continue with the meal
       prep!

       work no matter what, but if I don’t meal prep it ends up being
       something packaged and unhealthy. I also just love the time it

       I’ve been meal prepping for almost a year and a half and it has
       been a game changer for my lifestyle. I used to come home with
       little energy to cook and by the time I decided to I had eaten a
       snack that wasn’t the best for me. With meal prepping, I come home
       from work and if I’m hungry I take dinner out for the evening and
       eat. It’s such a relief to have it all finished and makes the rest
       of the evening much less hectic. Instead of spending an hour in the

       I’ve been meal prepping my breakfast and lunch for almost a year
       now and agree that sunday’s can be overwhelming with shopping and
       cooking food. That being said, I’m so much happier opening the
       fridge and pulling out my meals on the way to work than if I spent
       time every morning or evening doing the same. I also don’t have a
       microwave so my favorite thing to make are grain salads and
       especially Smitten Kitchens Broccoli Rubble and Farro Salad
       (https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/05/broccoli-rubble-farro-salad/).
       It is really delicious and a great starting off point for adding
       different veggies. I’ve really enjoyed using Kale and/or Butternut
       squash as stand-ins for the broccoli or broccolini. I also really
       like cold fried rice so I’ll make that and scramble in a few eggs
       for extra protein (note cold cooked zucchini is disgusting).
       Another dish I’ll rotate in occasionally is pasta salad – cold
       cheese filled tortellini tossed in pesto with tomatoes and olives
       is such a treat. I have bento boxes as well and put carrots, fruit
       or baby bell cheeses in the other slots. For breakfast I make
       overnight oats so I prep all of my containers on Sunday with oats,
       chia seeds and protein powder. The night before I want to eat the
       oats I add almond milk and the next morning I top them with fresh
       fruit (that I cut up on sunday) and granola. For dinner I don’t
       typically meal prep but I do serve the same meals on some nights,
       so it doesn’t feel like i’m cooking from scratch all the time.
       Sun/Tues/Thur are the sameish meal and Mon/Wed are the same meal as
       well. It helps me so that later in the week, when i’m more tired
       from work I’m simply reheating meals or putting together salads
       from food I cooked earlier in the week.

       We have been using Melissa Joulwan’s Well Fed Weeknights cookbook
       for over a year now after trying to commit to better meal planning.
       All of the meals are set up to be less than 30-45 minutes to
       prepare and all of the dishes are so good and reheat easily. One of
       the best things we have learned is how to “velvet” meat for stir
       fry; it prevents it from drying out and maintains the flavor. If
       you don’t want to commit to the cookbook, she features a lot of
       flavorful recipes on her blog meljoulwan.com.

       I’ve been trying to meal prep for at least a year and it hasn’t
       stuck yet. The only thing that’s stuck so far is I eat bagels and
       cream cheese for breakfast every day, so I prep that for two weeks
       and I’m good to go in the morning. It’s really helped my rushing to
       work in the morning (though it took me 6 years to figure it out
       :/).
       Otherwise, I find it to be too much work planning everything. I try
       to find recipes with repeating ingredients so I’m not buying 20 new
       things to make a few different meals. Then I have to make it all,
       pack it and fit it in the fridge. So, I watched a video this week
       where the woman makes several things separately – veggies, veggie
       burgers, rice, etc – and then she builds what she wants on the day.
       It reminds me of a taco night, which I love, so I’m going to give
       that a go starting today. I found couple bowl and salad recipes
       that use similar ingredients and I’m going to (try) and prep them
       tonight. Then over the next two weeks I can pick what I want in my
       bowl for lunch or dinner and throw it together before work or the
       night before.
       It sounds like a more practical plan for me and if it works, I’ll
       already have base recipes I can stock up my pantry for to have on
       hand whenever.

       I don’t do much meal planning, but I try to keep my favorite
       essentials on hand. My go-to recipes, which usually take an hour,
       are simple pasta, Cacio Pepe, fajitas, homemade pizza, and risotto.
       I also keep several of trader joe’s mixed salads for lunches and to
       supplement dinner, so I’m eating salads constantly. A salad at
       lunch, plus apples, nuts, and peanut butter keeps me going without
       much of a fuss. I usually have a low glycemic smoothie for
       breakfast, an egg, or oatmeal. Having a smoothie every day could be
       considered boring, but I look forward to it. I definitely would
       like to plan my meals better though – there’s a scramble on some
       days to eat, and my husband and I can go long hours without eating
       a thing (his habit, which soon became mine). Anyway, I’d love to
       try my recipes, but Blue Apron helps here and there with that,
       which I do about 1x a month.
       I would have such a hard time without a microwave! I use it all the
       time for leftovers! Thanks for sharing, so enlightening!

       I’m a big fan of “salad boxes” (jar salads in a Tupperware box
       because I want more salad). The only thing is that everyone else
       gets tired of it for 4 meals in a row. I forwarded this article to
       our in house chef to see if he likes your compromise approach!

       I’m a HUGE fan of meal prepping! I also use Sundays as my day to
       plan out, prep, and organize meals for the coming week. I find it
       so much more freeing and stress-reducing to have lots of meal
       choices on hand for lunches and dinners. Also makes me really love
       making breakfasts every morning as my one real chore of the day. I
       wrote a post recently about all the things I buy in bulk, many of
       which are used in the meal prepping process:

       I’ve always liked the idea of cooking meals ahead of time,
       especially for a week that is due to be particularly busy, but
       somehow the prepping never ends up continuing. Will be keeping
       these pointers in mind as I’d love to attempt it on a more regular
       basis.

       Hello Julia,
       I started meal prepping only 3 weeks ago so it’s all new for me as
       well! I think it’s the best way to feel more relaxed about food
       organization during busy weeks. I don’t like meal planning that
       much so i choose and gather my lunch early morning before going to
       work. During prep, i always make sure to have at least 4 types of
       vegetables (steamed), 2 types of meat/fish and starches. Result is
       stress saving and healthier life :) I would love to get your
       feedback after 2 months of meal prep! Keep sharing, you’re doing
       amazing work on GMG ;)

       Food prep is so hard! Even just cooking at night can become super
       wasteful! I never know how much food to buy or how hungry my
       husband and I will really be. I love the idea, just not sure if I
       could do it. You definitely inspire me to start though!

       We haven’t tried meal prepping but what does work for us is making
       a google sheet for the entire month and then planning each meal (B,
       L, D) in advance. We stock up on meat, eggs, etc at Costco (also
       love their rice cauliflower and frozen broccoli bags) about once a
       month and then go to the grocery store weekly for fresh produce.
       Not only does it cut back on the over spending and wastefulness,
       but it helps me to see the larger (monthly) picture of our food and
       I don’t make as many impulse buys. I also try to build in
       flexibility if we just aren’t feeling a meal one night (we can swap
       it out for another meal that week). Planning ahead allows me to see
       what dinners translate into packable work lunch leftovers too.
       Wonder if you’ve given this method a try? I think it would be
       especially helpful when you know you have upcoming travel in any
       given month…

       I’ve recently made an effort to be better about meal prepping
       lunches, Monday dinner and doing the grocery shopping for the week
       all at once. It’s made a big positive impact on our life. My
       strategy is to grocery shop for the minimum amount I think we will
       need ina week so there isn’t waste, but to complement this with
       making sure there are extra dry goods (like brown rice) and frozen
       food (frozen chicken, fish and vegetables) so we can always make a
       meal if we need without succumbing to takeout. xAllie

       started meal prepping my lunches and it has made a significant
       difference in how I feel but a lot of times I turn to the same five
       recipes and then it ends up ruining those for me because I get
       burnt out on them!

       Totally agree!! I haven’t made the jump to meal prep dinners, but
       I’ve been meal prepping my lunches 4 days a week. I feel guilty if
       a coworker asks me to lunch, because I know that that day’s meal
       will probably go to waste…but I think it’s still cheaper than
       eating out every day and much healthier than my old habits of
       frozen Trader Joe’s meals.
       Your glassware is SO cute by the way!! I got a cheap set on Amazon

       Love those bento boxes from anthro. I already have the clear ones
       and my husband and I absolutely love them. Best of luck to you. My
       one tip would be switching up your bases and fruits and veggies
       every week. I LOVE Dave’s Killer Bread (to switch from the ezekiel)
       and I bet you would love their mission and the taste as well. I do
       meal prep but find it more fun to buy different things each week to
       mix it up because we get really bored fast. My latest snack fav?
       Radishes as a sub for crackers. Dip in hummus, yogurt + dill dip or
       a yummy soft cheese (like Boursin garlic dipping cheese). Love your
       blog Julia and only writing because I know someone will read it and
       hopefully it will be helpful!

       I’ve been meal prepping for more than three years now–before I even
       knew “meal prepping” was a “thing”! It really saved me during my
       busy college days and now during my even-busier medical school
       days. Since I only have to feed one person, me, I actually only
       have to cook once every five days or so–I make about 7 servings and
       that leaves room to be flexible if a dinner invitation or catered
       event comes up unexpectedly.
       Some of my favorite things to prep are soups, chilis, and stews. A
       vegan chili made with the soy chorizo from Trader Joe’s (the
       chorizo seasoning does almost all the work for you!) is one of my
       frequent rotators, and so is a simple spaghetti bolognese with
       steamed broccoli and a billion permutations of Thai and Indian
       curries. They make it easy to get your protein (chicken or tofu or
       paneer, sometimes shrimp), carb (usually brown rice or quinoa) and
       vegetables (bell peppers and carrots work great) into your meal and
       are so filling.
       Good luck in your meal prepping adventure! I hope it becomes a fun
       way of life for you and Thomas like it did for me.

       This! I just started getting more serious about prepping healthier
       lunches again and I really love the approach of just changing a few
       meals each week to avoid stressing out over changing everything all
       at once. I don’t think I even know enough recipes to change all my
       meals right off the bat. If you’re interested, I work on a blog
       with my mom and our friend, Joy. It’s just a fun project to hone
       our skill and learn from. We just posted a short list of make-ahead
       lunch ideas too if you’d like to check it out – the blog is called

       Really loved this post! I have dabbled in meal prepping quite a few
       times in the last few years but my husband and I have come to the
       conclusion that it’s just not for us. Like you said, it’s hard to
       decide whether to leave assembly to day of or assemble everything
       hoping you feel in the mood to eat it on the designated day. This
       was our problem; we are very much “in the moment” eaters and we
       found that when it came to assemble or eat the meal already
       prepared we DREADED it and would end up snacking or grabbing take
       out which only meant more money was spent and unhealthy choices
       were made. We found our golden solution from a magazine where an
       interviewee said she shops for only 2-3 days worth of food at a
       time. Yes that means more trips to the grocery store but it also
       allows you to buy food you really want and we found we actually ate
       the food we bought and spent less money overall.
       Meal planning was definitely a serious wakeup call when I entered
       adulthood and married life, so I’m glad I’m not the only one trying
       to navigate it with a little bit of chaos.

       We also struggle with food waste. Something we started this year
       was using a meal kit service (we use the vegetarian blue apron
       plan) which for ours delivers 3 meals a week. Then we limit our
       actual grocery shopping to only a few things (fresh fruits and
       veggies) to get us through the week, and we usually eat out a
       couple times with friends or family. It’s still not perfect but is
       another option if you guys get tired food prepping.

       meals so that I have that meal for the next couple lunches or
       dinners. It’s a great simple solution but I’d love to to give meal
       planning a try on a larger scale!

       As someone who has always been curious about what it is like to
       meal prep, I loved reading your honest opinion. I have only seen
       meal prepping done in plastic containers, so the idea of using
       glass was a great tip! Have you ever considered preparing small
       amounts of fruit or cheese and crackers for daily snacks? I think
       it could be a great way to supplement the meals and sustain energy
       throughout the day! Have you considered making a video of one of
       your weekly meal prep cooking sessions? I would be sure to watch
       it!

       I used to meal prep ALL the time for many years. I’ve gotten quite
       over that approach in the past few months and have started making
       extra dinner the night before so that I can eat the leftovers the
       next day for lunch. This means that every day there is something
       different to eat and I’m not getting bored. I write out a weekly
       meal plan and try to use the same ingredients across various meals
       to minimise food waste. This means only one trip to the grocery
       store, and I know exactly what I need so I’m not wasting time
       searching around the aisles wondering what I need.

       I e been meal prepping for a few months, and my biggest challenge
       early on was with trying to incorporate too much variety. It became
       exhausting with all the cooking. Now I have w different dinners and
       2 different lunches per week. I choose exciting tasty dishes so I
       don’t mind having the same snacks and breakfast every other day.
       I’m doing it for weight loss, so it’s been very effective. But too
       much variety means I’m in the kitchen all day.

Our Current Favorite Beauty Products

   I love experimenting with new beauty and skincare products, but there
   are some staples I find myself returning to again and again. For
   example, I can’t count how many times I’ve re-purchased my favorite
   Bobbi Brown mascara or Fresh lip balms after using every last bit.

   piece.

Our Team’s Favorite Pieces From the September Collection

   I always look forward to seeing which Gal Meets Glam Collection pieces
   our team members are wearing and loving, and which pieces show up most
   often in the office. It’s especially fun seeing the ways different
   women on our team style them—it sometimes feels like the #gmgonme
   hashtag brought to life!
