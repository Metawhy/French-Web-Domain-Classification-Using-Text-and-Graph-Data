Two Amazing Locations

   Montreal & Quebec City

Montreal

   Montreal is a unique city. A city where language and culture meet. A
   city with a European flavor that will seduce you from the first day.

   It ‘s a bilingual city located on an island on the St. Lawrence River.
   It is the perfect place to learn English and French and immerse
   yourself in a cultural adventure.

    No matter when you choose to come, there is always something
   interesting and fun to do. Whether in summer, spring, autumn or winter,
   there is always something going on.

Quebec City

   Quebec is an amazing and beautiful city. It’s the heart of French
   culture in North America. A piece of Europe in the new continent.
   Majestic on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, Quebec is one of the
   most picturesque cities in the world and the capital of the province of
   Quebec.

   It is rich in history, architecture and traditions with a genuine
   European appeal.

   As the largest Canadian city that is 100% francophone, Quebec is the
   ideal place to immerse yourself in the language and at the same time
   enjoy all that this beautiful city has for you !!

What our students say

     * One of the BEST experience I have ever had. I had so much fun here
       in Montreal I don’t even know were to start. The food, the people,
       the places, the things that you can do, things you learn, everyday
       you learn a little bit of history of Montreal in a really cool way
       I recommend 100% and I would come again without thinking it twice
       “
       Andres Marin
       English Student - Mexico
     * When I arrived to Canada, I didn’t know any English nor French.
       After having taken BLI Bilingual program, my language skills in
       both languages improved a lot. Today I can say I AM TRILINGUAL
       “
       Bruna Marsola
       Bilingual Student - Brazil
     * I enrolled at BLI to learn English and I became a higher
       intermediate student in less than 6 months. The teachers are very
       professional and they make sure you understand and learn everything
       they teach you. Classes are very interactive. The school has
       students from all over the world so I was able to make many
       friends.
