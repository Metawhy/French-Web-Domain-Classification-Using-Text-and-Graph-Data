How to buy a property in France?

   If you are thinking of buying a property in Brittany, a villa on the
   sunny French Riviera, or an old mill in the countryside in Dordogne,
   there are a number of things you need to take care of, and questions
   you need to ask before moving, such as:

   Where can I find the finest properties in France? How should I organize
   my French viewing trip? How can I find the right estate agent to guide
   me in my project? What taxes are involved in property buying? How to
   finance a property purchase in France? How to move from my country to
   France?

   All your questions will be answered in our free Buying guide, that will
   help you at each step of your dream property purchase.
