RESEARCH SCHOOL / ECOLE DE RECHERCHE

   Spring School on Theoretical Computer Science (EPIT) – Homotopy Type
   Theory
   Ecole de Printemps d’Informatique Théorique (EPIT) – Théorie
   Homotopique des Types
   25 – 29 May 2020

   Description

   The EPIT is a French thematic school proposing, on an yearly basis, an
   intensive 5-day long training, specializing on a particular topic in
   theoretical computer science. It is primarily addressed to PhD
   students, Post-doctoral researchers and junior academics.

   The 2020 edition of the EPIT will be centered around Homotopy Type
   Theory, a research topic at the junction of Computer Science and
   Mathematics. Our hope is hence to provide an introduction that is
   accessible to researchers in both areas.

   Location

   The school will take place at Ile d’Oléron, CAES CNRS La vieille
   Perrotine.

   Andrej Bauer (Ljubljana University): Introduction to Homotopy Type
   Theory
   Bas Spitters (Aarhus University): The Coq-HoTT library
   Andy Pitts (Cambridge University): Models of (Univalent) Type Theory
   Anders Mörtberg (Stockholm University): Cubical Type Theory
   Guillaume Brunerie (Stockholm University): Synthetic Homotopy Theory
