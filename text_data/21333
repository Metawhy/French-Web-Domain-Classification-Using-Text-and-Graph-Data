The spring school

   The spring school is the 38th School in the series of "Ecole de
   Printemps d'Informatique Théorique" and is supported by the ESF project
   GAMES, the CNRS, GdR Informatique Mathématique andLaBRI.
     __________________________________________________________________

The lectures

   The spring school consists in nine lectures presenting important
   developments in language theory, automata, and games.

   Abstracts and slides are available there and the schedule is there.
     * Basic topology and game determinacy. (Jacques Duparc, Lausanne)
     * Basic stochastic games (Hugo Gimbert, Bordeaux)
     * Basics about algebraic approach to languages (Marc Zeitoun,
       Bordeaux and Cachan)
     * Stochastic pushdown games. (Antonín Kučera, Brno)
     * Algebra for tree languages. (Mikołaj Bojańczyk, Warsaw)
     * Profinite approach to language theory (Jean-Eric Pin, Paris)
     * Games, recursion schemes, and semantics (Luke Ong, Oxford)
     * Automata with counters (Thomas Colcombet, Paris)
     * Automatic structures (Markus Lohrey, Leipzig)

   The lectures are intended to be accessible to a wide audience, but some
   familiarity with automata theory and logic is recommended.

   Abstracts are available there and the schedule is there.
