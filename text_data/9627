   You can use tasks to track, collaborate on, and organize all your work.
   [c541ca.png]

   Tasks can be to-dos, ideas, notes, or reminders.
   [c541ca.png]

   Assign a task to yourself or a teammate.

   Press Tab+M to quickly assign a task to yourself.
   [c541ca.png]

   Add a due date so your deadline is clear.
   [c541ca.png]

   Add instructions and expectations in the task description field.
   [c541ca.png]

   Type @ to link to other tasks, people, conversations, or projects.
   [c541ca.png]

   When you @mention someone, they’ll be added to your task as a follower.

   Followers get notified when new comments or attachments are added.
   [c541ca.png]

   Add anyone who needs to stay up to date on your task as a follower.

   They can always unfollow to stop getting notifications on your task.
   [c541ca.png]

   Add comments to ask questions or give followers updates.

   Heart a comment to let followers know you’ve seen it.
   [c541ca.png]

   Add relevant files or irrelevant GIFs as attachments.

   You can also attach directly from Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box.
   [c541ca.png]

   Create subtasks to break your task into smaller steps.

   When you’ve added a subtask, press enter to add another.
   [c541ca.png]

   Subtasks can contain all the same details as regular tasks.

   Click the comment bubble to add comments or attachments to a subtask.
   [c541ca.png]

   You can create tasks from any screen using your top bar.
   [c541ca.png]

   Every Task has a unique URL to easily copy and share.
   [c541ca.png]

   Congrats! Looks like you’re up to the task.

   On to the next lesson!

   [e585b1.png]

   Always know what to do next with My Tasks.
   [e585b1.png]

   My Tasks is a list of every task assigned to you.

   It makes managing your work simple.
   [e585b1.png]

   Click on your My Tasks list and start typing to add tasks.

   Like a text document, add a new line for each new task or paste in any
   list.
   [e585b1.png]

   Forward to x@mail.asana.com to turn your emails into tasks

   Asana will translate your email into a task, including your
   attachments.
   [e585b1.png]

   New tasks will appear at the top of your list in New Tasks.
   [e585b1.png]

   Tasks you add to My Tasks are private to you.

   Click Make Public to share them with your team.
   [e585b1.png]

   Prioritize tasks as Today, Upcoming, or Later.

   Click on the blue dot next to the task, to quickly sort it.
   [e585b1.png]

   Mark the tasks you’ll have time for Today.
   [e585b1.png]

   Teammates can view your My Tasks list to see what you’re up to.

   They’ll only see tasks you’ve made public or shared in a project (more
   on projects later).
   [e585b1.png]

   Mark tasks due within a week as Upcoming so you can see what will be
   due soon.
   [e585b1.png]

   On its due date, your task will move from Upcoming to Today.

   Just like magic.
   [e585b1.png]

   Mark tasks due in more than a week for Later.

   They’ll be out of your way until their due date approaches.
   [e585b1.png]

   Your tasks will move from Later to Upcoming a week before they’re due.
   [e585b1.png]

   Keep My Tasks prioritized to always know what to work on and what’s
   coming next.
   [e585b1.png]

   Now you know how to track and plan your work!

   Next, learn how to work with your team in Asana.

   [96a3fc.png]

   Work together on groups of tasks with projects.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Projects help you track and organize the steps in a process or
   initiative.

   Like an event plan, product launch, or editorial calendar.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Like My Tasks, simply click and type to add tasks to your project.

   If you have your steps in a document or email already, paste in that
   list.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Add tasks to your project from email.

   View your project’s unique email address from the project dropdown
   menu.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Add your tasks to other related projects.

   Tasks can be included in multiple projects.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Add sections to organize tasks in a list project.

   Type Tab+N at the end of any task title to make it a section.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Or, add columns to organize tasks in a boards project.

   Drag and drop tasks between or within columns to reorder.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Assign your tasks and set due dates.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Never miss a deadline with your project calendar.

   Drag and drop tasks on your calendar to change their due dates.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Add everyone who needs to stay updated on your project as members.

   Project members will get notified of new conversations, statuses, and
   tasks.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Post conversations to make announcements or start discussions.

   Your post will be sent to all project members.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Use Progress to see how your project is moving forward.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Set a project status to update your team on how it’s going.

   The Project Owner will be reminded to set a status once a week.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Open and organize projects from your sidebar.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Favorite projects to pin them to the top of your sidebar.

   Click the star button on the left of your project name to favorite it.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Create new projects from any screen using your top bar.
   [96a3fc.png]

   Now you can move projects forward with your team.

   Just one more lesson before you dive in.

   [f2bc67.png]

   Communicate and coordinate faster with Inbox.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Check Inbox to quickly read and respond to your latest updates.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Inbox will notify you when you have a task due…
   [f2bc67.png]

   and when teammates update tasks, conversations, and projects you
   follow.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Open and respond to updates without leaving Inbox.

   Click an update and you’ll have all the context you need to respond.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Archive updates you’re ready to dismiss.

   Click the X that appears on the right of an update to archive it.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Open Archive to move dismissed updates back to your Inbox.

   Click the arrow that appears on the right of an archived update to move
   it back to Inbox.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Unfollow tasks or projects to stop receiving updates about them.

   In the end, you have control over the updates you receive (or choose
   not to receive)
   [f2bc67.png]

   When you’re ready, you can turn Asana’s Email notifications off.

   Most communication with your team can be more easily managed from
   Inbox. Just remember to check it often.
   [f2bc67.png]

   Congratulations! Now you’re ready to have a great work day with Asana.
