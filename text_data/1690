   Browser-update.org is a tool to unobtrusively notify visitors that they
   should update their web browser in order to use your website.

   This is done with care not to annoy, lock out or erroneously notify
   visitors!

   149647 sites are using this notification

   36485012 visitors have already updated their browser

How it works

    1. Include our small javascript notification on your website
    2. Visitors with out-dated browser will be informed by a small,
       undisturbing message box, that their browser is not up-to-date and
       it is recommended to update. (Try it out!)
       Your web browser (Internet Explorer 10) is out of date. Update your
       browser for more security, speed and the best experience on this
       site.Update browser Ignore
    3. By clicking the message, they will get to an info page with reasons
       why to update (or change) and a list of browsers available for
       their system.
       download firefox/internet explorer/chrome/opera to update your
       browser
    4. If the visitor ignores the advice, it won't reappear for some time.

Advantages and features

     * Unobtrusive The user will be notified only once a day by default.
       The notification is small and does not block the user from using
       the site.
     * Low maintenance and up-to-date We take care not to erroneously
       notify users by constantly tweaking and improving the detection
       code. Users are presented with an up-to-date list of browsers that
       are available for their system.
     * Customizable You can customize the style of the message, the text
       and other options.
     * Localized The message is automatically displayed in the user's
       language.
     * Complete and Tested Works for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, IE,
       Android Browser, Samsung, Opera, Chrome, Vivalid, Yandex, ... on
       Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Linux, ...
