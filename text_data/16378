Control over data

   You are able to opt out of having new data associated with your device
   and to request that we disassociate data we already have from your
   device. Below are the instructions on how to do so for a web browser
   and for mobile apps -- the process is different for each.

Web browser

   Some things to keep in mind when using the web-based opt out:
     * If you use more than one browser, or browser profile, you will need
       to opt out on each browser.
     * If you clear your cookies, and the opt out cookie is deleted, you
       will need to re-set the opt out.
     * The opt out may not function in browsers, such as Safari, that
       block or delete cookies.
     * Even after opting out, you may continue to receive advertising
       through our services, but those ads may be less relevant.
     * After you opt out, data we have collected about your browser will
       be disassociated from your device.
     * Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict
       cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser,
       you should renew your opt-out choice.
