Chinatown (fotobusta 2)

   "Robert Towne, the screenwriter of the 1974 classic “Chinatown,” wrote
   the movie as a eulogy to great things that were lost. He said that he
   was not conjuring a place on a map but a state of mind: the futility of
   good intentions." New York Times

The Poster Art of Renato Casaro

   AN ITALIAN MASTER OF POSTER DESIGN!

   Renato Casaro’s prolific career began in 1953, aged 19, at the famous
   Studio Favalli in Rome, part of the legendary Cinecittà studios. He
   would later go on to design and paint posters for many of the biggest
   directors in the world forming close friendships with the likes of Dino
   De Laurentiis, Sergio Leone and Bernardo Bertolucci. His brilliant
   portrayal of actors and his innovative use of color and composition saw
   him much in demand both in Italy and abroad. For a fascinating
   interview with the artist from 2014 check out FILMONPAPER.COM

   Most recently Quentin Tarantino hired Casaro (along with other great
   artists Steven Chorney, Martin Duhovic, and Tom Richmond) to create
   faux movie poster props for the film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The
   images Casaro designed portray the Leonardo DiCaprio character Rick
   Dalton in two fictitious Italian Westerns: Nebraska Jim and Uccidimi
   subito Ringo, Disse il Gringo (Kill Me Now Ringo, Said the Gringo). For
   more info about the collaboration go to MUBI.COM

   With over 300 of his posters in our collection, we present just a
   handful here for you to enjoy the scope of his work! For a more
   comprehensive view use the link: CASARO or use our search function
