Do You VMOSA?

   Posted on August 28, 2014 by PiroNet

   For the past many years as a contractor and several missions where I
   could help Organisations assess, diagnose, audit and evaluate their
   virtual infrastructures and cloud initiatives I stumbled upon the fact
   that many of them just lack a strategic planning process. Eventually
   those who actually have gone through the process, or kind of, often
   ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to communicate the outcome to the rest of the Organisation or
   ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to regularly update it. Seriously!

   Let‚Äôs (re-)define what actually is a Strategic Planning Process.

   Simply put, it‚Äôs about groups of people, coming most of the time within
   the Organisation, deciding together what they want to accomplish, aka
   the Vision, and how they are going to get there, aka the Action Plan.

   The Strategic Planning Process helps define VMOSA, which stands for
   Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategies, and Action Plans.

   VMOSA is a practical planning process that can be used by any
   Organisation. It is a comprehensive planning tool to help
   an Organisation by providing a blueprint for moving from dreams to
   actions.

   Let‚Äôs briefly define and characterise each individual part.

The VISION (The Dream)

   The Vision communicates what the organisation believes where they want
   to be in the near future, often within the 3 to 5 years. There are
   certain characteristics that a Vision statement should have:
     * Future focused
     * Challenging
     * Inspiring
     * Relevant
     * Concise

The MISSION (The What and the Why)

   Developing Mission statements are the next step in the
   strategic planning process. An organisation‚Äôs Mission statement
   describes what the organisation is doing and why it‚Äôs doing that. There
   are certain characteristics that a Mission statement should have:
     * Purpose oriented
     * Broadly
     * Concise

The OBJECTIVES (How Much Of What Will Be Accomplished By When)

   The next step is to develop the specific Objectives that are focused on
   achieving the Mission statement. An objective is derived from the goal,
   has the same intention as a goal, but it is more specific, quantifiable
   and verifiable than the goal. Remember that an Objective must start
   with the word ‚ÄúTo‚Äù. An organisation‚Äôs Objectives generally lay out how
   much of what will be accomplished by when.

   There are five basic characteristics to an objective that are called
   SMART:
     * Specific
     * Measurable
     * Achievable
     * Realistic
     * Timed

STRATEGIES (The How)

   The next step in the process of VMOSA is developing your Strategies.
   Strategies explain how the organisation will reach its objectives.

   There are basically three major steps in this process:
     * Collect information, internally and externally, to figure out where
       the organisation is now.
     * Synthesise it into a SWOT table.
     * Refresh and update your Vision to make still relevant and clear.

   There are four key questions you need to answer within your strategy
   planning session:
     * Who‚Äôs the strategy manager?
     * How to communicate the strategy?
     * Who‚Äôs accountable for the strategy?
     * How often the strategy status is updated?

ACTION PLAN (What Change Will Happen, Who Will Do What By When)

   Finally, an organisation‚Äôs action plan describes in great detail
   exactly how strategies will be implemented, within the wide strategy
   boundaries, to accomplish the objectives developed earlier in this
   process.

   Action steps are developed for each component of the intervention or
   changes to be sought. These include:
     * Action step(s): What will happen
     * Person(s) responsible: Who will do what
     * Date to be completed: Timing of each action step
     * Resources required: Resources and support (both what is needed and
       what‚Äôs available )
     * Barriers or resistance, and a plan to overcome them!
     * Collaborators: Who else should know about this action

   A good tip would be to regularly come together and talk about the
   plan and get updates. Eventually you will make adjustments and
   adaptations to the plan according to the feedback from the people who
   are responsible.  Your action plan will need to be tried and tested and
   revised, then tried and tested and revised again.

IN SUMMARY

   VMOSA is a great tool to help organisations with their strategic
   planning process. Establishing a strategic planning is a never
   ending process. But at the end of the day it is a worthless process if
   organisations don‚Äôt communicate the outcome to their staff and ensure
   all stakeholders have understood it.

You Just Failed Your Private Cloud Project‚Ä¶ Why?

   Posted on July 14, 2014 by PiroNet

   CLoud-Fail I have witnessed private cloud projects going belly up many
   times and by that I meant that these projects did not address the
   primary goals the sponsors set. Not that the goals were impossible
   or unachievable or maybe too exotic. Not at all! Actually the goals are
   the same for many organisations investing in private cloud projects.
   And by the way here are my top 3 goals organisations are looking at
   primarily when they decide to go private cloud:
    1. Cut down cost
    2. Better quality of service
    3. Increase Business agility

   So how comes organisations can‚Äôt address these simple goals? Where do
   they fail? Here are my 5 failure patterns:
    1. Managing-by-magazine. No strategic plans.
    2. Understanding your own requirements. No business case, migrate vs.
       innovate.
    3. Lack of a holistic architectural discipline. Cloud will not save
       you from a good architecture design buddy.
    4. IT organisation is not ready. Complexity to hide stupidity.
    5. Insufficient Skill Set. Politics, technology groupies, design by
       best practice.

   Now I tell you a secret. For a successful cloud project here is the
   recipe:
     * Adapt your business processes.
     * Simplify your IT processes.
     * Buy-in of key stakeholders.
     * Get the Experts in at the inception of the project.

   And remember that Cloud Computing is much more than a technology from
   VMware, OpenStack or Microsoft. Cloud Computing is business opportunity
   to achieve cost reduction, better quality of service and increase
   Business agility.

The Importance of The Non-Functional Requirements

   Posted on June 14, 2014 by PiroNet

   As an architect, one of my objectives is to collect, often to define,
   both the functional and non-functional requirements of a project. That
   seems so obvious, right!?

   As a former VMware employee, I was educated and trained to follow
   Zachman Framework along with Thomas Andrews‚Äòs Functional versus
   Non-Functional Requirements and Testing principles. Those who are
   VCDX‚Äôs or on their way to defend a VCDX design know exactly what I‚Äôm
   talking about.

   Back to the title and the importance of the non-functional
   requirements. Let me illustrate this statement with the following short
   story and a picture. As you know a picture is worth a thousand words.

   Once upon a time, there was this proud Hummer owner. After wearing out
   his tires he wanted a new set of wheels for his monster 4√ó4 truck. He
   got the nearest garage and requested four wheels, nothing more
   but nothing less. Illico presto the garage front desk clerk sold the
   guy four wheels and got them mounted on the SUV‚Ä¶ And voila!

   art_hummer_450


   Good laugh isn‚Äôt it üôÇ

   Did the garage front desk clerk sell the appropriate wheels‚Ä¶ Well
   probably YES he did!

   Those things ARE wheels and the main function of a wheel IS to rotate.
   This is WHAT a wheel must be able to do or perform.

   Beyond the fun and the buzz, we cannot imagine this truck winning the
   Dakar Rally with such wheels, can we!?

   That‚Äôs where the importance of the non-functional requirements come in
   the picture.

   A non-functional requirement states HOW a functional requirement should
   behave on top on what the function should do.

   Additionally non-functional requirements help you to measure the
   quality of the function.

   If only either the garage front desk clerk or the Hummer owner have
   defined the non-functional requirements we probably wouldn‚Äôt have these
   wooden wheels mounted on the SUV (and we wouldn‚Äôt have this funny
   picture either).

   Many times I‚Äôve seen and reviewed architecture design documentations
   where only  functional requirements were defined. Such designs have a
   common behaviour‚Ä¶ They used to fail to address the overall objectives
   of the project.

Back To The Basics

   Posted on May 20, 2014 by PiroNet

   During my time at Bull I had the opportunity to setup a Lunch&Learn
   program. For those who don‚Äôt know what it is, briefly it is a training
   event during lunch time. Usually the employer offers a free
   complimentary lunch.

   The program had a huge positive impact and highly appreciated by the
   employees at Bull, with packed room for most of the topics ‚Ä¶ maybe
   because of the free lunch üôÇ OK guys, just kidding here.

   The format of a Lunch&Learn program do not allow you to deep dive a
   topic but really to set the basics, get a good grasp on the concepts
   and the terminology.

   And that‚Äôs the trigger of this post.

   You would be surprised how much, Cloud Computing for instance, is
   misunderstood by the people. Adding to that the misuse of the term in
   many marketing materials, white papers articles, blog posts, etc.

   The big issue with this kind of situation is when we need to sit down
   and discuss a project, well each one has his own definition,
   terminology and conceptual view of the matter. Every one has his own
   opinion, more or less pertinent, but there is no consensus to move
   forward. How many of you had endless meetings just to agree about what
   is or is not a specific topic such Cloud Computing.

   That‚Äôs why it is important to get back to the basics and eventually
   start any project by (re-)defining the baseline, the basics, so we
   speak all the same language and share the same concepts and
   terminology. No mis-interpretation, mis-understanding, no
   mis-communication, no mis-perception, no mis-xxx for the good of the
   project‚Ä¶

   I would like to hear from you. Do you do such thing as set the basics
   prior starting a project? How do you deal with the mis-xxx? Do you
   define concepts and terminology within your architecture documentation
   for instance?

Physical Network Connectivity Lost And Intel¬Æ 82599 10 Gigabit
Ethernet Controller

   Posted on May 19, 2014 by PiroNet

   [UPDATE]
   Looks like the same issue shows up with Intel¬Æ Gigabit Ethernet
   Controllers such the i350-T4. And the same fix is to be applied‚Ä¶
   [/UPDATE]

   It‚Äôs been a long time I haven‚Äôt published anything on me blog site. As
   you may know I‚Äôve been working for Bull for the last 21 months.

   During that time I could familiarised with the awesomeness of Bull‚Äôs
   bullion server. A modular 4-socket x86 server that scales up up to
   16-socket by stacking 4 modules.

   For connectivity Bull certified state-of-the-art Intel¬Æ 82599 10
   Gigabit Ethernet Controller. However recently I came across a strange
   issue with some of those bullion servers. All of the sudden they would
   lost network connectivity. Starting with one port, then eventually both
   ports of a dual-port Intel¬Æ 82599 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller. The
   very specific symptom in this case is that the port would failed but
   would remain up in vSphere, while no traffic would go through. Also the
   Observed IP Ranges would show ‚Äònone‚Äô instead of the usual range of IP
   addresses. The basic troubleshooting steps and error codes would reveal
   a PCIe bandwidth issue to the CPU huh!?

   Long story short, the issue comes from a tiny BIOS function dealing
   with the power management of PCIe adapters known as ASPM or Advanced
   State Power Management.

   Basically Intel¬Æ 82599 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller are just not
   compatible with this function and I would bet none of the other server
   grade 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controllers are neither compatible with this
   function. Who would want his PCIe card being put down to save on power
   on production server!

   So to resolve this issue, disable ASPM on the BIOS/EFI configuration of
   the server. When ASPM is disabled, PCIe adapters without ASPM support
   operate normally.

   Also best is to follow recommendations in the Performance Best
   Practices for VMware vSphere¬Æ 5.5 especially for the hardware BIOS
   settings.

Could DINO Be The Future Of vSphere NUMA Scheduler?

   Posted on December 24, 2012 by PiroNet

Dee-No

   DINO the future of vSphere NUMA scheduler uh!
   220px-Dino_Harikalar_Diyari_Flintstones_06029_nevit
   First thing first, DINO is not Dino‚Ä¶ Dino is one of the  The
   Flintstones‚Äôs fictional characters.
   Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones. They‚Äôre the modern stone age family.
   From the town of Bedrock, They‚Äôre a page right out of history‚Ä¶yabba
   dabba doo time!
   All right, all right. DINO is not Dino. So what is DINO? I leave this
   for later.
   For now let‚Äôs focus on NUMA design and vSphere NUMA Scheduler.

So what is NUMA?

   Wikipedia says: ‚ÄúNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer
   memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time
   depends on the memory location relative to a processor. Under NUMA, a
   processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory,
   that is, memory local to another processor or memory shared between
   processors. NUMA architectures logically follow in scaling
   from symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures‚Äù

   NUMA is often contrasted with Uniform Memory Access (UMA) which is
   a shared memory architecture used in parallel computers. All the
   processors in the UMA model share the physical memory uniformly. In a
   UMA architecture, access time to a memory location is independent of
   which processor makes the request or which memory chip contains the
   transferred data. Read more at Wikipedia.

   Figure 1 shows a classic SMP system where there is usually a single
   pool of memory also referred as an Uniform Memory Access (UMA). That is
   memory access is equal for all processors. Contention-aware algorithms
   works well here.
   Figure 1 : SMP system - Uniform Memory Access (UMA)

   Figure 1 : SMP system ‚Äì Uniform Memory Access (UMA)

   The main drawback of the UMA architecture is that it doesn‚Äôt follow in
   scaling from symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures where many
   processors must compete for bandwidth on the same system bus. That‚Äôs
   why server vendors added NUMA design on top of SMP design. The first
   commercial implementation of a NUMA-based Unix system was the
   Symmetrical Multi Processing XPS-100 family of servers, designed by Dan
   Gielan of VAST Corporation for Honeywell Information Systems Italy
   (HISI). In 1991 Honeywell‚Äôs computer division was sold to Groupe Bull.
   How interesting is that!

   Figure 2 shows a classic SMP system with Distributed Shared Memory
   (DSM). In a DSM system there are multiple pools of memory and the
   latency to access memory depends on the relative position of the
   processor and memory. This is also referred to a Non-Uniform Memory
   Access or NUMA.
   Figure 2 : SMP system - Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) - Non-Uniform
   Memory Access (NUMA)

   Figure 2 : SMP system ‚Äì Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) ‚Äì Non-Uniform
   Memory Access (NUMA)

   Major benefit; each processor has local memory with the lowest latency.
   On the opposite remote memory access is slower.  Intel says that
   latency can go up to 70% and bandwidth as less than half of local
   access bandwidth.
   But the biggest downside of DSM is that it only works well if the
   operating system is ‚ÄúNUMA-aware‚Äù and can efficiently place memory and
   processes. The OS scheduler and memory allocator play a critical role
   here.

   vSphere is NUMA aware as long as the BIOS reports it. That is as long
   as the BIOS builds a System Resource Allocation Table (SRAT), so the
   ESX/ESXi host detects the system as NUMA and applies NUMA
   optimizations. If you enable node interleaving (also known as
   interleaved memory), the BIOS does not build an SRAT, so the ESX/ESXi
   host does not detect the system as NUMA. Does that mean that vSphere
   doesn‚Äôt do any optimization if you haven‚Äôt enabled NUMA in the BIOS? I
   guess it doesn‚Äôt since the scheduler doesn‚Äôt know the relationship
   between processor and local memory. That information is only given by
   the SRAT as I understand it.

What are vSphere NUMA optimizations I‚Äôm referring to?

   Before we deep dive vSphere NUMA optimizations, first let‚Äôs define a
   Home Node. A Home Node is one of the system‚Äôs NUMA nodes containing
   processors and local memory, as indicated by the System Resource
   Allocation Table (SRAT).

   They are two main vSphere NUMA optimization algorithms and settings you
   find in the vSphere NUMA Scheduler:
    1. Home Nodes and Initial Placement. When a virtual machine is powered
       on, ESX/ESXi assigns it a home node in a round robin fashion. To
       work around imbalanced systems when virtual machines are stopped or
       become idle, there is a second set of algorithms and settings
       called,
    2. Dynamic Load Balancing and Page Migration. ESX/ESXi combines the
       traditional initial placement approach with a dynamic rebalancing
       algorithm. Periodically (every two seconds by default), the system
       examines the loads of the various nodes and determines if it should
       rebalance the load by moving a virtual machine from one node to
       another. This calculation takes into account:
         1. the resource settings for virtual machines and
         2. resource pools to improve performance without violating
            fairness or resource entitlements.

   To get a detailed description of the algorithms and settings used by
   ESX/ESXi to maximize application performance while still maintaining
   resource guarantees, visit  vmware.com.

   vSphere  NUMA Scheduler has put in place pretty smart algorithms and
   settings when it comes to initial placement and memory management. I
   was wondering could it be better?
   For instance, by managing contention for shared resources that occurs
   when memory-intensive threads are co-scheduled on cores that share
   parts of the memory hierarchy, such as last-level caches and memory
   controllers.

Meet DINO

   Sergey Blagodurov from Simon, Sergey Zhuravlev, Mohammad Dashti and
   Alexandra Fedorova, all from Simon Fraser University, have published a
   very interesting technical paper at Usenix.org about limitation of
   current NUMA design and a proposition of a new approach they called
   DINO which stands for Distributed Intensity NUMA Online.

   Those guys have discovered that state-of-the-art contention
   management algorithms fail to be effective on NUMA systems and may even
   hurt performance relative to a default OS scheduler.

   Contention-aware algorithms focused primarily on UMA (Uniform Memory
   Access) systems, where there are multiple shared last-level caches
   (LLC), but only a single memory node equipped with the single memory
   controller, and memory can be accessed with the same latency from any
   core.

   Remember that unlike on UMA systems, thread migrations are not cheap on
   NUMA systems because you also have to move the memory of the thread. So
   their approach to the problem is a mechanism that ensure that
   superfluous thread, those that are not likely to reduce contention, are
   not migrated in a NUMA system.

   Existing contention aware algorithms perform NUMA-agnostic migration,
   and so a thread may end up running on a node remote from its memory.
   Actual vSphere NUMA scheduler is mitigating this issue by detecting
   when most of a VM‚Äôs memory is in a remote node and eventually load
   balancing and migrating memory as long as it doesn‚Äôt cause CPU
   contention to occur in that NUMA node.

Could DINO Be The Future Of vSphere NUMA Scheduler?

   DINO organizes threads into broad classes according to their miss
   rates, and to perform migrations only when threads change their class,
   while trying to preserve thread-core affinities whenever possible.
   VMware vSphere NUMA optimizations would benefit from this by adding
   DINO approach to the existing optimization code by eventually migrate
   memory based on threads and their miss rates as well.

   In vSphere 5.x VMware introduced vNUMA. It presents the physical NUMA
   typology to the guest operating system. vNUMA is enabled by default on
   VMs greater than 8 way but you can change this by modifying the
   numa.vcpu.min setting. Is this an attempt to hand over the critical
   NUMA scheduler job to the guest OS hoping it does a better job? I would
   say that it may seems a good approach but at the cost of losing
   control. In a shared environment such a VMware environment, the virtual
   machine monitor should be in control, always.

Eggnog

   I‚Äôm not within the secret of Gods. I don‚Äôt have access to VMware
   developers and codes. Thus what I‚Äôm being saying here is based on a
   series of elements, readings, articles, vendor architecture documents
   that I have compiled and read through while preparing
   Santa Christmas Eve with an enhanced version of eggnog in my mug.
   Therefore I may be wrong, off-target, totally inaccurate in my
   conclusion‚Ä¶

   If you have another point of view, piece of information I don‚Äôt have.
   If I missed something in my thought process just post a comment. I‚Äôll
   be very happy to read from you!

Letter To Santa

   Posted on December 21, 2012 by PiroNet

   Dear Santa, I‚Äôve been terrific at virtualising low hanging fruit over
   the past years. I have reduced costs while increasing availability,
   reliability and performance for my applications. I‚Äôm a prodigy, I‚Äôm a
   super-hero!

   Now my CIO asked me to realize the same wonder with our business
   mission-critical applications!

   Those applications are massive man! They require a lot of resources and
   they need mainframe-style availability and performance.

   Only monster vm‚Äôs can cope with the load and I need even bigger monster
   servers to hold them up!

   Please Santa, I need you to get me some MONSTER BULLION‚Äôs
   Monster Bullion
