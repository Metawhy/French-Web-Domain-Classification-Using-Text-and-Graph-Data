   The Inspiring Story Of Mr. Mo, Elderbull Ambassador
   Moses was surrendered to a shelter by his owners in Florida due to his
   age. Sniffing Snouts Pit Bull Rescue posted his picture to our Facebook
   page and we then rescued him on June 25th, 2012.

   Moses brought our attention to the overwhelming number of senior dogs
   that find their way into shelters across the country. Moses came to us
   housebroken, well trained and a gentle loving dog. He went on to become
   a chef, advocate for elderbulls and one of Facebooks favorite faces. On
   February 17th, 2014 Moses was diagnosed with an inoperable spinal cord
   tumor. Moses lost his brave battle on March 26, 2014 and has since
   inspired this project.

Josie the Yorkie’s Abuser Is A NC Teacher

   Teacher Suspended for Animal Cruelty|

   Physical and/or emotional abuse of people and animals is always a
   difficult situation to comprehend. Disturbing acts such as extreme
   neglect that leads to illness, undernourishment, extreme emotional
   discomfort, and death is even more incomprehensible when done by
   someone entrusted to teach our children. Josie, the sweet little
   yorkie, looked unrecognizable as a dog when she [...]
