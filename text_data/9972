Privacy Policy

   This policy is effective as of May 25, 2018.

   Punchbowl, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy and providing
   you the most powerful and safe online experience. This publication
   intends to help you understand how personal information you provide to
   Punchbowl, Inc. is collected and used, so you can make informed
   decisions when using the website located at https://www.punchbowl.com
   ("Punchbowl").

   By using Punchbowl, you consent to the data practices described in this
   statement. Notices of all changes that materially affect ways that your
   personally identifiable information may be used or shared will be
   posted in updates to our privacy policy. If you continue to use
   Punchbowl and services after these notices of changes have been posted
   to the site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices.

   If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please
   contact: privacy@punchbowl.com.

Personal Information We Collect

   In order to become a Punchbowl member you must first register for our
   service. During this registration process you are required to provide
   personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address and
   name. Once you are a member you may provide additional information for
   your member profile such as home address, zip code, date of birth,
   gender, preferences, interests and favorites. Providing additional
   information beyond what is required at registration is optional, but
   will allow you to better identify yourself and find services at
   Punchbowl.

   Punchbowl, Inc. does not solicit, or knowingly collect and store
   personal information from anyone under the age of 13. Punchbowl, Inc.
   will immediately remove and delete any and all information from anyone
   under 13 if notification is provided that a person under 13 registered
   at Punchbowl. If you have a reason to believe information was collected
   about a child under 13, please contact privacy@punchbowl.com.

   There is also information about your computer hardware and software
   that is automatically collected by Punchbowl, Inc. This information can
   include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times,
   pages visited, features used and referring Web site addresses. This
   information is used by Punchbowl, Inc. for the operation of the
   service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general
   statistics regarding use of Punchbowl.

   In order to invite others to view your Punchbowl page, you must provide
   Punchbowl, Inc. with their email addresses or phone number. In order to
   send messages to your guests through Punchbowl, we require that you
   submit to Punchbowl current, valid email addresses or phone numbers for
   your guests. When you send messages to your guests, we collect and
   retain the email addresses, phone number, or other pertinent contact
   information of those persons to whom you send the message. Even though
   we retain contact information about your guests, Punchbowl, Inc. will
   not use these email addresses to send promotional communications,
   newsletters, or service announcements without your explicit permission,
   nor will we intentionally sell or otherwise disclose guest contact
   information that you submit to any third party. If a guest chooses to
   register with Punchbowl, that individual will be considered a Punchbowl
   member and may receive promotional communications, newsletters, and
   service announcements from Punchbowl, Inc. according to the terms and
   conditions of this privacy policy.

   If you directly disclose personally identifiable information or
   personally sensitive data through a Punchbowl message that is shared
   publicly, this information may be collected and used by others.
   Punchbowl, Inc. does not read any of your private online
   communications.

   Punchbowl, Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web
   sites you choose to link to from Punchbowl so that you can understand
   how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Punchbowl,
   Inc. is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on
   Web sites outside of the Punchbowl and Punchbowl, Inc. family of Web
   sites.

How We Use Your Personal Information

   Punchbowl, Inc. collects and uses your personal information to operate
   Punchbowl and deliver the services you have requested. When you
   register with Punchbowl, you are automatically enrolled in our
   marketing emails. These marketing emails have information about
   upcoming holidays, new features, and useful tips about using the
   website. If you do not wish to receive these marketing emails, simply
   unsubscribe the first time you receive an email. You can quickly and
   easily unsubscribe by clicking the "Unsubscribe" links in the email.
   When you unsubscribe, you will no longer receive the marketing emails.
   However, you will continue to receive emails that are related to your
   usage of the Punchbowl website. Punchbowl, Inc. also uses your
   personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or
   services available from Punchbowl, Inc. and its affiliates. Punchbowl,
   Inc. may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your
   opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be
   offered. Punchbowl, Inc. will communicate with you through emails and
   messages posted on Punchbowl.

   Punchbowl, Inc. may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of
   carefully selected business partners about a particular offering that
   we believe may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique
   personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, zip code)
   is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Punchbowl, Inc. may
   share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical
   analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or
   arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from
   using your personal information except to provide these services to
   Punchbowl, Inc., and they are required to maintain the confidentiality
   of your information.

   From time to time, Punchbowl, Inc. may enter into strategic
   partnerships in which your personally identifiable information may be
   provided to a carefully selected business partner. These strategic
   partnerships may include private-label, co-branded websites, or other
   promotional web pages for which Punchbowl, Inc. receives financial
   compensation. Any strategic partners to whom we disclose personal
   information may have their own privacy policies, which describe how
   they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern
   use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have
   shared it with those strategic partners as described in this Privacy
   Policy.

   Punchbowl, Inc. keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers
   visit within Punchbowl, in order to determine what Punchbowl, Inc.
   services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized
   content and advertising within Punchbowl to customers whose behavior
   indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

   Punchbowl, Inc. will disclose your personal information, without
   notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
   that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law
   or comply with legal process served on Punchbowl, Inc. or the site; (b)
   protect and defend the rights or property of Punchbowl, Inc.; and, (c)
   act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users
   of Punchbowl, Inc., or the public.

   Notwithstanding any other provision, we may allow third parties to
   monitor Site activity using cookies, web beacons and similar
   technologies for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics,
   targeted advertisements, “click-throughs” and/or other activities. We
   may also engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you
   (including IP address and information about your browser or operating
   system) through cookies. The cookies may reflect demographic or other
   data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your
   email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed,
   non-human readable form. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie
   on your computer or device via their pixel on our website and in email
   communications you've opted to receive from us. Our partners use this
   information to recognize you across different channels and platforms
   over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting
   purposes. This information is used to help select and display targeted
   advertisements that are believed to be of interest to you (sometimes
   called "online behavioral advertising" or "interest-based advertising"
   or "OBA"). If you would like to "opt-out" of being served OBA on the
   Website by our third-party advertising companies, please go to
   http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

   Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data partner we
   have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your
   mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you
   use applications or surf the internet, or to seek to identify you in a
   unique manner across other devices or browsers. In order to customize
   these ads or content, we or a data partner may connect de-identified
   demographic or other data about you (received from third parties)
   either to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email
   address, or to data passively collected from you, such as your device
   identifier or IP address. To learn about how to opt-out, please go to
   http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

Use of Cookies

   Like most websites, Punchbowl, Inc. uses "cookies" to allow you to
   bypass the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a
   tiny data file, which resides on your computer and allows Punchbowl,
   Inc. to recognize you as a member when you return to Punchbowl from the
   same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
   deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
   and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
   cookie to you.

   One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
   feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
   server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you
   register with Punchbowl, a cookie helps Punchbowl, Inc. to recall your
   specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
   of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
   shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to Punchbowl, the
   information you previously provided can be retrieved.

   You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
   automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
   setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
   cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the
   Punchbowl services.

Security of Your Personal Information

   Punchbowl, Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized
   access, use or disclosure. Punchbowl, Inc. secures the personally
   identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a
   controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use
   or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number)
   is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of
   encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

How You Can Control Your Personal Information

   You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal
   information in the following ways:

   If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for
   direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by
   writing to or emailing us at privacy@punchbowl.com.

   If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from
   Punchbowl, Inc. please click the unsubscribe link included in the
   footer of all of our emails.

   If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect
   or incomplete, please email at privacy@punchbowl.com. We will promptly
   correct any information found to be incorrect. You may also request
   that we delete the information we have collected about you at any time
   by emailing us at privacy@punchbowl.com. Please note that in certain
   circumstances, we may not be able to completely remove your information
   from our systems. For example, we may retain your information for
   legitimate business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud
   or future abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law or
   as retained in our data backup systems or cached or archived pages, or
   where the burden or expense of accommodating your request would, in our
   good faith judgment, be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy,
   or where the rights of others may be violated. All retained personal
   information will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy
   Policy to which the User has previously agreed.

   Finally, you may request access to the information we have collected
   about you by sending a request to privacy@punchbowl.com.

International Users

   This Privacy Policy applies when you are using our Services globally.
   If you are using our Services from a country outside the United States,
   you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be
   transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and is
   subject to the laws of the United States. You acknowledge that the
   United States may have data protection laws less stringent than or
   otherwise different from the laws in effect in the country in which you
   are located. Where we transfer your personal information out of the
   country in which you are located, we will take steps to ensure that
   your personal information receives an adequate level of protection
   where it is processed and your rights continue to be protected.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

   Punchbowl, Inc. will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we
   make changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and will
   revise the effective date at the top of this agreement. We recommend
   that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any
   changes to the Privacy Policy.

   Punchbowl, Inc. welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy.
   If you believe that Punchbowl, Inc. has not adhered to this Privacy
   Policy, please contact Punchbowl, Inc. at privacy@punchbowl.com. We
   will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and
   remedy the problem.
