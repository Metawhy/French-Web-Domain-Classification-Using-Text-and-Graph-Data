ABOUT NORMAL ARCHITECTURE

   Normal Architecture does not pretend to be what we are not. We do
   exactly that, normal architecture, in a perhaps not so normal way. The
   work of Normal Architecture can be seen as an attempt at celebrating
   the mundane, the banal, and the everyday in architecture. Often, the
   work simply disappears, at best they attempt to rethink the everyday
   qualities which we take for granted in our complex (and often
   confusing) urban environment.

   Normal Architecture believes that architecture should no longer be
   limited to the job of designing buildings. It should be practiced as a
   discipline of knowledge and a process of cultural production. Therefore
   an architectural project needs to be redefined. For Normal
   Architecture, a drawing, a piece of text, a magazine, a book, a public
   forum and a building carry the same weight intellectually– if not
   financially- as architectural projects. Normal Architecture works on
   the basis of collaboration.

MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION OF MALAYSIA (MBAM) HEADQUARTERS DESIGN
COMPETITION: THE PORTAL

   Rethinking   An Institutional Building

   Institutional buildings are often conceived as enclosed, inward looking
   buildings where spatial relationships are limited within itself. These
   kind of institutional buildings - with limited connection to the
   outside - belongs to the past.

   Our scheme proposes a rethink of what an institutional building should
   be. In place of a solid, enclosed building, we propose an open
   structure with equal emphasis on the relationship between internal
   spaces as well as with the surrounding. We believe that the
   architecture for an institution in the 21st century should be a open
   structure which enables and facilitates sets of relationships between
   the users, the city and the natural environments.

   It is not enough for the New MBAM Centre to be ‘just a building’.

   The Portal

   Befitting MBAM’s vision to be the ‘Prime Mover and the Recognised Voice
   of the Malaysian Construction Industry’ our scheme proposes the New
   MBAM Centre as The Portal. Throughout the history or architecture, the
   portal has been used as a device to give buildings a sense of dignity,
   grandeur, monumentality and also openness. The Portal is at once iconic
   and inviting.

   The MBAM Portal should be understood as a formal and spatial device.

   Formally, The Portal is instantly iconic, a metaphorical gateway
   towards the future of the construction industry. Spatially, The Portal
   results in a monumental and generous open space framed by the building
   program. We call this space The Great Hall.

   The Portal is more than ‘just a building’.

   Formally it defines an identity, a new image for MBAM. Spatially it
   creates place, a location which is filled with a sense of possibility
   and potential.

   The Great Hall

   This monumental space is conceived as an experimental multi-purpose
   space where exhibitions, demonstrations and other events related to the
   construction industry could be held. It will be a vibrant, active space
   filled with daylight and connected to the outside. Flexible partitions
   and screens will allow the space to accommodate different uses.
   Adjustable screen doors are lowered into place when protection from the
   weather is required.

   The activities conducted in the Great Hall will be visible to the
   passers by and will serve as promotion for the activities of the New
   MBAM Centre. It’s ever- changing nature is a constant reminder of
   MBAM’s commitment to innovation and creativity.

   Monumental yet inviting, The Great Hall symbolizes and realizes MBAM’s
   commitment to demonstrate innovative design, engineering and building
   excellence.

   The Portal was a collboration with Arkitek Foo Hui Ping and Studio
   Karya and was awarded 3rd Prize in the MBAM Headquarters Competition,
   cited by the jury as “an innovative design approach”

SHINKENCHIKU RESIDENTIAL DESIGN COMPETITION 2017: LIVING IN CARPARK
DIMENSIONS

   Malaysians love their cars. The limited access to public
   transportation networks forces many Malaysians to spend hours daily in
   the confines of their cars. Perhaps this relationship with cars also
   explains our preference for living in terrace (row) houses where
   cars are parked within the house compound and are immediately
   accessible.

   A typical terrace house unit in Malaysia - usually 2 to 3 stories
   in height - averages 8 meters in width and 25 meters in length, while
   a carpark bay typically measures 2.5 meters in width and 5 meters
   in length. This proposal explores the spatial implications of
   reducing the width of terrace house units from 8 meters to a mere 2.5
   meters- the width of a carpark bay - while retaining its length– which,
   at 25 meters is equivalent to the length 5 carpark bays arranged end
   to end.

   The reduction in horizontal dimensions led to a vertical arrangement of
   spaces in a section with split levels. Spaces are connected to a
   central staircase/shelf and are always next to terraces andgardens
   which bring in light and air. This vertical spatial sequence culminates
   in an indoor garden on the top floor with a retractable roof. This
   proposal is not meant as a solution, or a prototype for the market, but
   is an attempt to question our relationship to spatial dimensions. What
   kind of qualities could be generated in spaces of minimal dimensions?
   What could it be like to live in houses with carpark dimensions?

   Living in Carpark Dimensions was a submission for the 2017 Shinkenchiku
   Residential Design Competition with the theme of ‘House of Dimensions’

THE GRID: INSTALLATION FOR NEUE ARTISANS 4.0

   Neue Artisans is founded by BandLab: Bureau of Architecture and Design,
   and organised together with a collective of design enthusiasts. The
   initiative was to organise a design showcase in support of the
   ever-developing local design industry, seeking to explore improved/new
   techniques, experiments on possibilities and components in design, art
   and architecture. We encounter a pool of emerging talents here in
   Malaysia and the region. Neue Artisans brings together this network,
   and is becoming a kind of design-trade show for emerging design-makers.

   For Neue Artisans 4.0, Normal Architecture together with Studio Karya
   were commissioned to carry out the installation under the
   theme ‘Technique’. Our installation took on the form of The Grid

   9 POINTS ON THE GRID

   • “In the spatial sense, the grid states the autonomy of the realm of
   art. Flattened, geometricized, ordered, it is antinatural, antimimetic,
   antireal. It is what art looks like when it turns its back on nature.”1
   • The grid is not new, nor is it in anyway an original invention or
   idea. Architecture does not need to be in pursuit of the new all the
   time.
   • Any attempt to make the same grid will inevitably yield certain
   degrees of differences. The grid is always the same, but somehow always
   different.
   • The grid is anti iconic; it is an attempt to make architecture which
   is invisible, not in terms of being transparent, but rather by being a
   background for other things. However, the grid could also be
   monumental, which is different from iconic.
   • The grid as a construction becomes a technique to measure and frame
   space and events. It presents itself as a sampling and indexing device.
   • The grid is not formally complex, yet its apparent neutrality allows
   it to frame complexity. It is pointless to respond to complexity with
   more complexity.
   • The neutrality of the grid and the fact that it is an author-less,
   pre-existing instrument, makes it is the ideal technique for the
   collaboration between two practices. Without realising it, both of our
   practices have been fascinated by the grid. For different reasons,
   perhaps.
   • The biggest challenge in working with the grid was the discipline to
   stop ourselves from trying to ‘design’, beyond what is already there to
   be appropriated.
   • For us, the grid somehow addresses both the idea of limits and
   possibilities in architecture; both are equally fascinating and perhaps
   not so mutually exclusive?

GUEST ROOMS FOR JAIN TEMPLE COMPLEX @ SODE, SIRSI, KARNATAKA - OR THE
ARCHITECTURE OFF THE CITY.

     The clients’ brief was simple, ‘some guest rooms and a garden with
     24 different types of trees (24 because it represents the 24
     messengers or preachers of Jainism who have achieved the highest
     state of human conscious and Moksha) and together it should form
     what they referred to as a ‘Wisdom Park’.

     The site is a beautiful contoured tapering land facing a 10th or
     11th century stepped lake. The position of the lake in the context
     is very precise as it is situated in the lowest part between the
     gentle valley formed by hill formations running east to west.

     The temple complex itself is situated amidst dense forested
     condition with the farmlands and the temple being the only signs of
     any settlement.

     Our response was to the tapering site was to offer a inhabitable
     perimeter colonnade with both public and private programs. The
     Private zones are formed by repeating the courtyard rooms 12 times
     in each wing with a courtyard - a buffer zone connecting the public
     programs with staircase-  after 6 rooms. The same configuration is
     duplicated and aligned to the northern edge of the site.

     The voids left between the hilly ground and the linear organization
     of the courtyard rooms form the public zones of the project -almost
     as a negotiation between the logic of organization its residue
     formed as a response to the context.

     If the rooms are above the public room then they have a single
     height courtyard with an open bathroom, a stepped bath tub and a
     tree. If it is below the public program then it has a double height
     courtyard that creates adjacent terraces for the public zone.

     the building is completed by a entrance lobby on the East and a
     large open pavilion or Veranda on the West - framing the lake.

     The building is conceived to be made of very basic and austere
     construction system of exposed concrete frame structure with exposed
     brick inlay - sometimes solid and sometimes forming a simple
     screen.

     The courtyard accommodates the garden with 24 trees.

     —

     Status: To be re-designed as only a garden with 24 trees, a fountain
     and a fence.

     We are currently developing the Garden Option.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Anecdote: The meeting was over in 5 minutes when the client
     said ‘perhaps me and you are not on the same page.’

     me: ‘but you wanted those room.’

     Client: ‘It wasn’t me it was the other person..!’ ‘I just need a
     garden with 24 trees and a fountaint.’

     Me: ‘That would have saved a lot of time for all of us… but
     nonetheless, let’s do the garden.’

     Client: ‘ the models look good, can I keep them? You can take them
     whenever you want. I just want to study them.

MGBC NEXT GENERATION GREEN BUILDING COMPETITION

   THE MACHINE AND THE LIVING LAB

   The competition brief called for the design of a Next Generation Green
   Office building with the intention of providing research environment
   for the Malaysian Green Building Council (MGBC) within the campus of
   Universiti Kebangsaaan Malaysia (UKM).

   SUSTAINABILITY
   - Sustainability should be approached as an issue on the scale of an
   ecosystem rather than just a single isolated building.
   - Public awareness of sustainable issues is a key point of departure
   for the proposal.

   GREEN FOOTPRINT - THE LIVING LAB
   - By stacking the building as a small tower, a significant portion of
   the site is given back to the public in the form of a LIVING LABORATORY
   which preserves and improves the living ecosystem on site and
   promotes public curiosity and involvement with sustainability issues.
   - A portion of the Langat River, a neglected ecosystem running in
   parallel to the site is diverted through the site as a landscape
   feature which also serves as the demonstration for the possibilities of
   treating polluted waterways.

   BUILDING - THE MACHINE
   - The MGBC Building itself is conceived as a MACHINE which demonstrates
   the application of various passive and active sustainable design
   principles. Instead of having the mechanisms of a Green
   Building hidden, they will be exposed and made visible and accessible
   for researchers and the public.
   -The rooftop mechanical space – normally hidden - is combined with
   greenery to create the publicly accessible MACHINE-PARK, exposing the
   inner workings of a sustainable building to the public.
   - The building becomes a tool to promote stronger awareness of
   sustainability to the general public.

   PUBLICNESS
   - An elevated landscape deck is connected via a bridge to the (UKM)
   sports field across Jalan Bangi, enabling the public life of the
   university to spill over onto the MGBC site.
   - Elevating the landscape deck above ground allows a visual connection
   to the Langat River, UKM gains a waterfront.

   NEXT GENERATION WORKING ENVIRONMENT
   - The minimal programs required in the brief are simply stacked on top
   of one another and connected through an internal garden atrium.
   - The new generation working space is approached as the variety of
   working conditions available to the staff – conventional enclosed
   environments, shaded but naturally ventilated working terraces and
   even working among the trees in the garden.
   - The new and flexible working spaces allow the possibility of chance
   encounters – with fellow staff and the public alike - and collaboration
   leading to a new modes of working and a new work culture.

   LANDMARK
   -The tallest building in UKM is not only a landmark for the university,
   but will be a landmark for sustainable development.

   This scheme was a collaboration with Arkitek Foo Hui Ping and Abdul
   Hakim Abdullah and was shortlisted in the top 16 of the AJIYA-MGBC Next
   Generation Green Office building competition

TELUK KUMBAR MARKET COMPETITION

   The proposal for the Teluk Kumbar Market is centred around the idea of
   redefining the brief in terms of what constitute the program of a
   market in order to best serve the local community and the introduction
   of the 5 FOOT RING as a conceptual and physical ordering device to
   frame the existing greenery on site and bring a strong coherence to
   assemblage of programs and forms.

   Below are the main ideas underlying the proposal:

   MASTER PLANNING The large area of the site in comparison to the amount
   of built space as requested in the brief led us to formulate a master
   planning strategy for the site.

   THE 5 FOOT RING Inspired by the ubiquitous 5 foot way, the 5 foot ring
   is here introduced as an ordering device which ties together the
   various components of the development. The 5 foot ring lends a strong
   visual identity to the scheme, while also acting as circulation and
   defining the area of the existing fruit orchard to be preserved as the
   ‘green lung’ of the development.

   THE MARKET PLACE AS AN IN BETWEEN CONDITION The scheme is an attempt at
   mediating between the small scale of the kampong in the vicinity and
   the large scale of development in the surrounding area.

   REDEFINING THE MARKET The market is redefined as series of spaces and
   events expanding the utilitarian requirements of the brief towards the
   formulation of a ‘place’ for the community.

   MARKET HALL Market stalls are staggered around a sizable central void,
   providing a clear sense of orientation and view of all the stalls upon
   entering the market hall.

   MARKET LAYOUT Stalls are laid out in a clear and straightforward
   manner, with clearly delineated zones for servicing and storage as well
   as extra spaces for informal stalls.

   PEDESTRIAN GROUND LEVEL Vehicular circulation is restricted in very
   specific areas of the site, ensuring a ground level which is pedestrian
   friendly.

   GENDER EQUALITY AND SAFETY Spaces are laid out in a manner avoiding
   hidden circulation and corners. The 5 foot ring which connects all the
   buildings, define the in-between spaces as well as contributing towards
   visually defensible spaces.

   The Teluk Kumbar Market was a collaboration with Arkitek Foo Hui Ping.

MUSEUM OF CAPITALISM COMPETITION: THE BIG BOX

   The Big Box is a proposal for a museum stripped bare of any
   monumentality, identity or even character. This banal building is an
   embodiment of total anonymity, maximum efficiency and pure speculation
   - in short the key characteristics of capitalism. It is big. It
   is a-contextual. It is expandable. It is repeatable.It is not beautiful
   and it doesn’t try to be. It is architecture reduced to it’s bare
   essence, the provision and demarcation of empty space. Here the act of
   designing is denied any aesthetic role but put in the service of
   ensuring efficiency and achieving maximum space, in which anything (or
   nothing) can take place.

   Typology of Capitalism
   The Big Box is inspired by the contemporary big box buildings which are
   big, generic,warehouse-like structures accommodating disparate and
   often interchangeable functions such as supermarkets and distribution
   centers.From the suburbs of America to the logistic hubs of the
   Euro-Delta to the mega-cities of Asia, these big boxes are now found
   throughout the world, often along highways on the periphery of urban
   areas. Through these buildings the invisible flow of capitalism is
   given physical- albeit temporary - form. Inside the big box, capitalism
   is reified.

   The ubiquity of the big box buildings canbe seen as symptomatic of the
   homogeneity of the hegemony of capitalism. Despite their immense size,
   the lack of any qualities associated with architectural aesthetics
   renders them invisible. Ubiquitous, anonymous - with the exception of
   color schemes or logos announcing their corporate affiliations - and
   endlessly repeatable,the generic big box is the ultimate typology
   of capitalism.

   The Big Box as Museum
   The Big Box is made up of two main components, the perimeter / facade
   whose presence demarcates the physical limit of the museum and an
   interior which presents itself as an absence of architecture in favor
   of emptiness and possibility. With services and supporting facilities
   concentrated within a linear strip along the perimeter, this empty
   space could be utilized in its entirety as one big open exhibition
   space, or it could be subdivided into different strips offering
   different experiences of capitalism. Within these strips different
   activities concerned with production of goods and subjectivity could
   take place simultaneously;film-making, artificial nature,
   quasi-religious motivational speeches, mini-golf. What is on display
   are not simply artifacts, but the processes of production. The back of
   house becomes the front of house. The museum utilizes the idea of flows
   in a distribution center as the means of circulation and display in a
   demonstration of assembly line - like efficiency.

   The Big Box is not a museum for slow,quiet contemplation. It is
   immediate. Its intention is to merge the visitors with the flows
   of capitalism. Its focus is on speed and efficiency. In The Big Box the
   act of displaying and observing is recast in the mold of production
   and distribution, the museum as demonstration of pure efficiency,
   capitalism given form.

   *The Big Box was awarded Honorable Mention in the ideas competition for
   the Museum of Capitalism.

FRAMING THE COMMON: KL EXHIBITION LAUNCH

   In conjunction with the participation of Framing the Common at the
   TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE exhibition at the 2016 Venice Biennale of
   Architecture,the Kuala Lumpur team with Normal Architecture and Port
   25 will be organizing a ‘copy’ of the exhibition in Venice at Port
   Commune, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.The exhibition will run from
   28/05/2016 until 28/06/2016 with the launch event to take place on
   Saturday, 28/05/2016, 3pm (KL Time).

   FRAMING THE COMMON

   The Common as interpreted within this collective research has a
   multi-fold position. It refers to the commonly–owned shared spaces of
   the modern project of housing, globally; but also to their condition of
   sameness, of repetition, and standardization, while also to processes
   of collectivity and commoning, and to what we already have in common as
   human-subjects. The deliberate aim of this research is to shift the
   discussion of collective housing away from the private living units
   towards the sphere of the Commoning; perhaps the true spatial
   manifestations of collective living. Freed from the individual
   idiosyncrasies that would sooner or later embellish—and even
   redefine—the living units, the Common is subjected to rules,
   regulations and enforcement beyond the control of any individual
   homeowners, becoming a strange in–between zone which is clearly no
   longer private, but is not fully public either. If we understand
   Commonness as a condition of sameness for all collective housing
   projects, how could they somehow still generate difference? How can the
   Common be framed different globally?

   The four projects—in Bogota, Tehran, Mumbai and Kuala Lumpur—carried
   out under the banner of Framing the Common, are similar in that each
   are investigations of the Common in the context of the political
   project of Modernism and Globalization, through the lens of the most
   basic units of the modern society: housing. Yet, the projects are also
   different in the way the cases of the Common are framed in each
   context. Each city has a specific modern—and pre-modern—history in
   relation to the West, colonialism, and global relations; as well as
   specific experiences of modernism. How these different experiences—and
   their respective political implications—are translated spatially are
   the areas of interest explored in this collective research; an
   inventory of sameness and difference.

   The on-going project of Framing the Common is currently being displayed
   at the Tehran Biennale of Architecture (12 May to 11 October 2016) and
   will be a part of the TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE Exhibition organized by the
   Global Art Affairs Foundation as an official part of the 2016 Venice
   Architecture Biennale (28 May to 27 November 2016).

   The exhibition in Kuala Lumpur (28 May to 28 June 2016) is conceived as
   a mirror or reflection of the exhibition in Venice and will serve as an
   overview of the entire project as well as serving as a platform for
   exchange and discussion on issues relating specifically to the Kuala
   Lumpur project, which focuses on the Razak Mansions housing estate in
   Sungai Besi.

   Framing the Common is an independent collective project focusing on the
   modern home and its conditions.
