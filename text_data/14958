   The first reported death tied to vaping in the United States was
   confirmed on Friday by officials from the Illinois Department of Public
   Health.

   The patient, whose name, age, sex and hometown have not been released,
   was hospitalized with severe respiratory illness after recently using
   e-cigarettes, officials said.

   Doctors nationwide have been seeing more patients with severe lung
   disease tied to vaping. Illinois experienced 22 such cases last week,
   with the patients ranging from ages 17 to 38.

   vaping-related lung problems
     __________________________________________________________________

   Additionally, a team from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention is helping Illinois officials investigate another 11
   possible cases.

   "The severity of illness people are experiencing is alarming and we
   must get the word out that using e-cigarettes and vaping can be
   dangerous," Illinois Public Health Department Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike
   said in a statement.

   In what has been referred to as an “ongoing outbreak” of vaping-related
   illness, no specific e-cigarette product has been found to link all the
   cases, according to New Atlas.

   The CDC is involved in an ongoing investigation of 193 cases of
   negative health outcomes due to vaping in 22 states, the agency
   disclosed in a report last week.

   Symptoms of vaping-related severe lung disease include difficulty
   breathing, shortness of breath and chest pain. Fatigue, diarrhea and
   vomiting also have been reported.

   CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield issued a statement regarding the
   death of the Illinois resident.

   “This tragic death in Illinois reinforces the serious risks associated
   with e-cigarette products," Redfield said. "Vaping exposes users to
   many different substances for which we have little information about
   related harms – including flavorings, nicotine, cannabinoids, and
   solvents.

   "CDC has been warning about the identified and potential dangers of
   e-cigarettes and vaping since these devices first appeared.
   E-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women, or
   adults who do not currently use tobacco products.”
