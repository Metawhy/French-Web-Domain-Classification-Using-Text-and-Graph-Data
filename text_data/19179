   Cheese and pizza lovers rejoice! The classic cheese pizza has been
   taken to a new level after the creation of a pizza topped with 154
   varieties.

   Johnny Di Francesco (Australia) at 400 Gradi restaurant in Melbourne,
   wanted to get a pizza the action after he saw the news about our
   previous record holder for greatest variety of cheese on a pizza.

   cheese-laid-out.jpg

   The record previously stood at 111, but Johnny felt he could beat it as
   he had previously created the 99-cheese pizza.

   His inspiration for this creation came from the 2014 film The Mutant
   Ninja Turtles, in which one of the characters, Donatello, refer to a
   pizza topped with 99 different cheeses as a "culinary impossibility".

   However, Johnny disabried, and decided to tackle the task.

                         johnny-with-the-cheese.jpg

   After the 99-cheese pizza was successfully created, it was added to the
   400 Gradi menu.

   "We had an overwhelming response from our customers, so much so that
   they petitioned to have it a permanent menu item," explained Johnny.

   "Since then we decided to up the ante and create a 154-cheese pizza. So
   my apologies Donatello, culinary impossibility debunked!"

   So from their 99-cheese pizza, they were determined to top the record
   of 111 and ended up with a final total of 154.

   "While the 154-cheese pizza may not have been a culinary impossibility,
   it was certainly a culinary challenge! We knew it was an ambitious
   idea, but probably more-so than first anticipated."

   Listing all the different cheese types after they had been weighed and
   put into separate pots

   "We also needed to be sure each individual cheese was distinct enough
   from the next, yet complimentary to each flavour, and could blend
   really well together once combined."

   "The cheeses included the likes of gorgonzola, pecorino, Taleggio, aged
   cheddar, gouda and of course, many more!"

   close-up-of-uncooked-pizza.jpg

   After the initial pizza was made – with just a gram of each type of
   cheese – 400 Gradi then rolled them out to their different restaurant
   venues in Australia.

   To be able to do this, the remaining cheese was melted down together
   and chilled into a single big block of 154 cheeses which was then
   distributed.

   But how did the patrons react to the cheese-tastic pizza?

   "There are too many to recall but overall, incredibly positive," Johnny
   added.

   "Many were completely overwhelmed and in awe of course; watching my
   customers' facial expressions as they took their first bite into a
   slice of cheesy goodness – well, that reaction is priceless."

   It seems it was a hit with customers as the "Cheesy Pizza" sold out of
   venues within five days, with a total of 797 sold.

   Cheese and pizza lovers rejoice! The classic cheese pizza has been
   taken to a new level after the creation of a pizza topped with 154
   varieties.

   Johnny Di Francesco (Australia) at 400 Gradi restaurant in Melbourne,
   wanted to get a pizza the action after he saw the news about our
   previous record holder for greatest variety of cheese on a pizza.

   cheese-laid-out.jpg

   The record previously stood at 111, but Johnny felt he could beat it as
   he had previously created the 99-cheese pizza.

   His inspiration for this creation came from the 2014 film The Mutant
   Ninja Turtles, in which one of the characters, Donatello, refer to a
   pizza topped with 99 different cheeses as a "culinary impossibility".

   However, Johnny disabried, and decided to tackle the task.

                         johnny-with-the-cheese.jpg

   After the 99-cheese pizza was successfully created, it was added to the
   400 Gradi menu.

   "We had an overwhelming response from our customers, so much so that
   they petitioned to have it a permanent menu item," explained Johnny.

   "Since then we decided to up the ante and create a 154-cheese pizza. So
   my apologies Donatello, culinary impossibility debunked!"

   So from their 99-cheese pizza, they were determined to top the record
   of 111 and ended up with a final total of 154.

   "While the 154-cheese pizza may not have been a culinary impossibility,
   it was certainly a culinary challenge! We knew it was an ambitious
   idea, but probably more-so than first anticipated."

   Listing all the different cheese types after they had been weighed and
   put into separate pots

   "We also needed to be sure each individual cheese was distinct enough
   from the next, yet complimentary to each flavour, and could blend
   really well together once combined."

   "The cheeses included the likes of gorgonzola, pecorino, Taleggio, aged
   cheddar, gouda and of course, many more!"

   close-up-of-uncooked-pizza.jpg

   After the initial pizza was made – with just a gram of each type of
   cheese – 400 Gradi then rolled them out to their different restaurant
   venues in Australia.

   To be able to do this, the remaining cheese was melted down together
   and chilled into a single big block of 154 cheeses which was then
   distributed.

   But how did the patrons react to the cheese-tastic pizza?

   "There are too many to recall but overall, incredibly positive," Johnny
   added.

   "Many were completely overwhelmed and in awe of course; watching my
   customers' facial expressions as they took their first bite into a
   slice of cheesy goodness – well, that reaction is priceless."

   It seems it was a hit with customers as the "Cheesy Pizza" sold out of
   venues within five days, with a total of 797 sold.

   Cheese and pizza lovers rejoice! The classic cheese pizza has been
   taken to a new level after the creation of a pizza topped with 154
   varieties.

   Johnny Di Francesco (Australia) at 400 Gradi restaurant in Melbourne,
   wanted to get a pizza the action after he saw the news about our
   previous record holder for greatest variety of cheese on a pizza.

   The record previously stood at 111, but Johnny felt he could beat it as
   he had previously created the 99-cheese pizza.

   His inspiration for this creation came from the 2014 film The Mutant
   Ninja Turtles, in which one of the characters, Donatello, refer to a
   pizza topped with 99 different cheeses as a "culinary impossibility".

   However, Johnny disabried, and decided to tackle the task.

                         johnny-with-the-cheese.jpg

   After the 99-cheese pizza was successfully created, it was added to the
   400 Gradi menu.

   "We had an overwhelming response from our customers, so much so that
   they petitioned to have it a permanent menu item," explained Johnny.

   "Since then we decided to up the ante and create a 154-cheese pizza. So
   my apologies Donatello, culinary impossibility debunked!"

   So from their 99-cheese pizza, they were determined to top the record
   of 111 and ended up with a final total of 154.

   "While the 154-cheese pizza may not have been a culinary impossibility,
   it was certainly a culinary challenge! We knew it was an ambitious
   idea, but probably more-so than first anticipated."

   Listing all the different cheese types after they had been weighed and
   put into separate pots

   "We also needed to be sure each individual cheese was distinct enough
   from the next, yet complimentary to each flavour, and could blend
   really well together once combined."

   "The cheeses included the likes of gorgonzola, pecorino, Taleggio, aged
   cheddar, gouda and of course, many more!"

   close-up-of-uncooked-pizza.jpg

   After the initial pizza was made – with just a gram of each type of
   cheese – 400 Gradi then rolled them out to their different restaurant
   venues in Australia.

   To be able to do this, the remaining cheese was melted down together
   and chilled into a single big block of 154 cheeses which was then
   distributed.

   But how did the patrons react to the cheese-tastic pizza?

   "There are too many to recall but overall, incredibly positive," Johnny
   added.

   "Many were completely overwhelmed and in awe of course; watching my
   customers' facial expressions as they took their first bite into a
   slice of cheesy goodness – well, that reaction is priceless."

   It seems it was a hit with customers as the "Cheesy Pizza" sold out of
   venues within five days, with a total of 797 sold.

   Cheese and pizza lovers rejoice! The classic cheese pizza has been
   taken to a new level after the creation of a pizza topped with 154
   varieties.

   Johnny Di Francesco (Australia) at 400 Gradi restaurant in Melbourne,
   wanted to get a pizza the action after he saw the news about our
   previous record holder for greatest variety of cheese on a pizza.

   The record previously stood at 111, but Johnny felt he could beat it as
   he had previously created the 99-cheese pizza.

   His inspiration for this creation came from the 2014 film The Mutant
   Ninja Turtles, in which one of the characters, Donatello, refer to a
   pizza topped with 99 different cheeses as a "culinary impossibility".

   However, Johnny disabried, and decided to tackle the task.

                         johnny-with-the-cheese.jpg

   After the 99-cheese pizza was successfully created, it was added to the
   400 Gradi menu.

   "We had an overwhelming response from our customers, so much so that
   they petitioned to have it a permanent menu item," explained Johnny.

   "Since then we decided to up the ante and create a 154-cheese pizza. So
   my apologies Donatello, culinary impossibility debunked!"

   So from their 99-cheese pizza, they were determined to top the record
   of 111 and ended up with a final total of 154.

   "While the 154-cheese pizza may not have been a culinary impossibility,
   it was certainly a culinary challenge! We knew it was an ambitious
   idea, but probably more-so than first anticipated."

   Listing all the different cheese types after they had been weighed and
   put into separate pots

   "We also needed to be sure each individual cheese was distinct enough
   from the next, yet complimentary to each flavour, and could blend
   really well together once combined."

   "The cheeses included the likes of gorgonzola, pecorino, Taleggio, aged
   cheddar, gouda and of course, many more!"

   After the initial pizza was made – with just a gram of each type of
   cheese – 400 Gradi then rolled them out to their different restaurant
   venues in Australia.

   To be able to do this, the remaining cheese was melted down together
   and chilled into a single big block of 154 cheeses which was then
   distributed.

   But how did the patrons react to the cheese-tastic pizza?

   "There are too many to recall but overall, incredibly positive," Johnny
   added.

   "Many were completely overwhelmed and in awe of course; watching my
   customers' facial expressions as they took their first bite into a
   slice of cheesy goodness – well, that reaction is priceless."

   It seems it was a hit with customers as the "Cheesy Pizza" sold out of
   venues within five days, with a total of 797 sold.
