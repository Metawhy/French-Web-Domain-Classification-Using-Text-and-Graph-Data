We believe that car hire is about the journey itself

   For over 70 years, Avis has put our customers at the heart of
   everything we do. We go the extra mile, offering ultimate flexibility
   and convenience, to meet the high expectations of sophisticated car
   enthusiasts.
   With more than 5,000 car rental locations across the UK, Europe and
   worldwide, Avis has a car for every occasion. Whether you’re looking
   for van hire or a delivery and collection service, we have a fleet of
   vehicles that are ready to whisk you away.
   Through constant innovation, a dedication to quality and competitive
   pricing, we strive to inspire your next journey. Indeed, you will
   always get our best prices when booking on this website when signed in
   to Avis Preferred, our free-to-join loyalty programme. If you find an
   equivalent Avis car or van cheaper on a price comparison site or broker
   site we will refund the difference.
   Sign up to our newsletter for the latest Avis offers and join our
   loyalty programme to access special perks.
   Above and beyond with Avis car rental
   At Avis, we are immensely proud of the fleet of cars we have built up
   over the years. So, if you need a compact car for a city break, an
   8-seat minivan for the whole family, or anything in-between, we have
   the right set of wheels for you. We don’t stop at rental car services
   however. Thanks to our expanding fleet of vans, we can also help you
   move house, expand your business or embark on that dream adventure
   holiday. Simply choose the van hire best suited to your needs and get
   ready to buckle up. No matter if you’re looking to rent a car on a
   budget or splash out on a prestige vehicle, we are confident our
   impressive range will cater to your needs. Check out our economy car
   rentals to keep things within your budget or browse Avis Prestige for
   something more luxurious.
   A whole world of rental car services
   With a network of locations all over the globe, our car hire services
   reach far and wide without ever compromising on quality. Whether you’re
   looking for a four-wheel drive to explore Africa or something sportier
   for Mediterranean coastlines, we can deliver. Thanks to a multitude of
   pick-up and drop-off locations worldwide, we can ensure that when you
   rent a car it’s a stress-free and convenient experience. Our one-way
   car hire service is particularly helpful if you’re looking to go from A
   to B (even across different continents) without having to drive full
   circle. Want us to come to you? Consider it done with Avis Delivers,
   our driveway drop-off and collection service for UK residents. It’s the
   same story if you fancy a car waiting for you at the
   airport or long-term hire.
   We try harder so you don’t have to.  ...  Read more

Avis long-term car hire

Our simple alternative to leasing and contract hire when you need a vehicle
for up to 90 days – with no early return penalties.

   At Avis we know that sometimes a car is not just for a short trip but
   needs to be used for extended periods of time. This is why we offer
   Avis Flex – our long-term car hire offer.

   Avis Flex gives you the freedom to hire a car for up to three months,
   without the ties of leasing. Whether needed as a stop gap whilst
   waiting for a company car or in between cars because your new one is on
   order. You’ll have access to a choice of flexible long-term car hire
   options with no long-term commitment. It is the ideal solution if you
   don’t want the commitment of a fully leased vehicle, all you have to do
   is pick your car and drop it off when you no longer need it.
   Furthermore, without an early return penalty, if your plans change and
   you no longer need the rental car, simply return it to us.

   Avis Flex is our simple alternative to leasing for you. If this sounds
   like the type of hire car offer you are looking for simply check our
   available fleet online.

   If you are a business customer, please call us on 0808 284 7733 or
   visit the Avis Flex Business page.
