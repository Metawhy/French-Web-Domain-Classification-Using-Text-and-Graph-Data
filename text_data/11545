  USE AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS AND SPONSORS; THIRD PARTY
  COOKIES AND TRACKING DEVICES

   This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help us
   customize your experience.

   We work with online advertising companies to provide you with
   advertising that is as relevant and useful as possible. Some of the
   online ads you are served may be based on the content of the page
   you're visiting, some may be based on registration information you
   provide, and other ads may be customized based on predictions about
   your interests generated from your visits to other web sites.

   These companies company may collect and use information about your
   visits to our site and other websites not owned and operated by NetLine
   Corporation, and may also combine this information with other data
   about your purchases and interests from other online and offline
   sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
   interest to you. In addition, we may share non-personal website usage
   information about visitors of our website with these companies for the
   purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market
   research analysis. For these purposes, our third-party advertising
   companies may note some of the pages you visit on our website through
   the use of pixel tags (also called clear GIFs). In the course of
   serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers may place or
   recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer.

   We may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links
   to the websites of affiliate entities or of advertisers or sponsors who
   are companies that are not owned or operated by NetLine Corporation,
   its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These entities may
   independently solicit and collect personal information or send their
   own cookies and/or clear GIFs to our visitors. The data collected is
   used in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that
   may be of interest to users of the Website and other interactive media
   and may be used to keep track of user response to each advertisement.
   We also work with third-party data analytics and online targeting
   companies. Some of these companies may use anonymous information (not
   including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about
   your visits to this and other websites in order to provide data and
   targeting recommendations based on which we may provide advertisements
   about goods and services of interest to you.

   Many of the third-party companies we work with are members of the
   Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative on online marketing
   and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and
   establishing responsible business and data management practices. The
   NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted
   advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about
   opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, visit Network
   Advertising Initiative and/or YourAdChoices to see your opt-out choices
   from other participating companies.

    1. Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our
       behalf, which may include business analytics, customer service,
       marketing, distribution of surveys or promotion programs, payment

       their functions and are not permitted to share or use the
       information for any other purpose.

       these optional services, we may share information about you,
       including your personal information, with those partners. Please
       note that we do not control the privacy practices of these
       third-party business partners.

       is recorded about a user or activity on our Site, such as the

       references an individually identifiable user. We may share this
       aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with our
       business partners to provide their own services to others, such as
       behavioral advertising or business analytics services. We also may
       share this aggregated, non-personally identifiable information
       publicly to show, for example, trends in technology products and
       services purchases or rankings amongst providers of such products
       and services based on aggregated reviews and comments.
    4. Social Media Services. You can choose to access certain third-party
       social media websites and services through our site (such as
       LinkedIn and Twitter). When you do so, you are sharing information
       with those sites, and the information you share will be governed by
       their privacy policies. You may also be able to modify your privacy
       settings with these third-party social media web sites.

  Links

   There may be several publication qualification forms that are linked
   directly on our partner's site. Although we strongly encourage our
   partners to employ similar security measures, we cannot be responsible
   for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement
   applies solely to information collected by NetLine's TradePub.com
   website.

  Newsletter

   As part of your TradePub.com membership, you will receive periodic
   email newsletter updates offering you access to contextually relevant
   free resources, offers, and content related to your Profile Information
   as well as your historical content consumption behavior.

  Choice / Opt-Out

   Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional
   materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these
   communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in all
   email communications. Alternatively, you can request to be removed from
   our newsletter list by emailing 'tpsupport@netline.com' with your
   request. Opting out from receiving our emails will place your
   membership stats into a "Read Only" state meaning that you can only
   consume/interact with the content you have historically already
   requested. Requesting any new content will consequently trigger your
   account in an "Active" status which would then reintroduce you to
   receiving our email newsletter updates. Users of our site are always
   notified when their information is being collected by any outside
   parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to
   whether they should proceed with services that require an outside
   party.

  Security

   NetLine takes every precaution to protect user information. When users
   submit sensitive information via TradePub.com or branded websites the
   information is protected both online and offline.

   When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
   information (i.e. credit card number or social security number), that
   information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.

   While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
   also do everything in our power to protect user information offline.
   All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
   above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
   information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing clerks or customer
   service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable
   information, and then only through password protected screen savers.
   Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
   privacy practices. When new policies are added, our employees are
   notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and
   what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.
   Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable
   information are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

   While NetLine will work very hard to maintain secure sites, no data
   transmission on the Internet can be guaranteed.

  Notification of Policy Changes

   NetLine Corporation is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.
   As this policy may change from time to time we encourage you to check
   back periodically.

   We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
   which the information was collected. However, if at any point we decide
   to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from
   that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way
   of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we may use
   their information in this different manner.

  Visiting our Site from outside the United States.

   If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, please be
   aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and
   processed in the United States where our servers are located and our
   central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the
   United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as
   those in your country, but please be assured that NetLine takes steps
   pursuant to laws in the United States to ensure that your privacy is
   protected. By visiting our Site or using our services, you understand
   that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those
   third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy
   Policy.

  Your California privacy rights.

   California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to
   request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal
   information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To
   make such a request, please email privacy@TradePub.com.

  Children's privacy.

   The Site is a general audience site and does not offer services
   directed to children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may
   provide any information to or on the Site. We do not knowingly collect
   personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do
   not use or provide any information on this Site or on or through any of
   its features, do not register on this Site, use any of the interactive
   or comment features of this Site, or provide any information about
   yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email
   address, or any screen name or user name you may use. Should an
   individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal
   information to us or should we learn that we have collected or received
   personal information from a child under 13 without verification of
   parental consent, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as
   reasonably possible. If you believe we might have any information from
   or about a child under 13, please contact us as directed below.

  How we secure your information

   We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
   protect the information we collect and store. Unfortunately, no
   security measures are 100% foolproof, and as such no network or system
   (including ours) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against
   destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to
   information we collect and store. If you believe your information may
   not be secure for any reason, please contact us immediately at
   privacy@tradepub.com

  Managing Your Information

   You have many choices to access information we collect about you and
   about how we use or disclose that information. This section details
   many of those choices, including how you can exercise rights you may
   with respect to your information (including personally identifiable
   information), how you can opt out of collection and use of certain
   types of information for certain purposes (such as marketing), and how
   you can use your browser or third-party tools to disable certain
   collection methods (such as cookies or tracking technologies).

   You may access, correct, amend, or delete information by accessing your
   profile within TradePub.com. For instructions on how to permanently
   delete your profile from your TradePub.com account, please contact us
   at privacy@tradepub.com. Please note that permanent deletion of your
   profile through this process will impair or disable those features with
   respect to the content you have historically requested and featured
   within your 'My Library'.

   If you wish to cancel your account, you may do so at any time. Simply
   contact us at privacy@tradepub.com to request your account deletion. If
   you do, personally identifiable information associated with your
   account will be deleted as soon as is reasonably practical or as
   required by applicable law. Please note that we may retain information
   that is otherwise deleted in anonymized and aggregated form, in
   archived or backup copies as required pursuant to records retention
   obligations, or otherwise as required by law.
