THE 2019 WORLD SERIES OF POKER EUROPE STARTS SUNDAY

   October 07, 2019 - 12:39:18 PM EST
    |  Isaac Hanson
   THE 2019 WORLD SERIES OF POKER EUROPE STARTS SUNDAY

   King's Resort to host WSOP Europe for the third consecutive year.

   More than €22 million in guarantees will be spread over 15 gold
   bracelet events.

   ROZVADOV, Czech Republic -- The 2019 World Series of Poker Europe
   officially gets underway at King’s Resort in Rozvadov, Czech Republic
   Sunday, October 13. This year’s series will mark the 11th edition of
   World Series of Poker Europe, and will be the third consecutive year
   that King’s Resort plays host to Europe’s biggest poker series.

   Everything World Series of Poker-related in 2019 has been bigger from
   the WSOP at the Rio to the WSOP Circuit, and that will continue in
   Europe starting Sunday. The 2019 WSOP Europe series will feature 15
   bracelet events, which is the most ever for WSOPE, and €22,472,450 in
   guarantees. For perspective, last year’s WSOP Europe awarded
   €20,977,184 in total.

   King’s Resort is also bigger than in year’s past. The resort grew from
   250 to 402 hotel rooms and 160 to 200 poker tables since last year to
   help accommodate for this year’s bigger series.

   Bracelet events this year range from the lowest buy-in ever in series
   history to the highest buy-in ever. The WSOP Europe Opener - €350
   No-Limit Hold’em is the kickoff event to the series and is the most
   affordable buy-in ever offered in a WSOP Europe bracelet event. On the
   other end of the spectrum, Event #4: €250,000 Super High Roller
   No-Limit Hold’em is the most expensive buy-in ever offered in a WSOP
   Europe event. This mega high roller will attract some of the game’s
   best and is expected to award one of the largest top prizes in World
   Series of Poker Europe history. The current record for the largest win
   ever at World Series of Poker Europe belongs to four-time bracelet
   winner Dominik Nitsche for his victory in the 2017 €111,111 High Roller
   for One Drop for a whopping €3,487,463.

   The 2019 WSOP Europe brings with it several new bracelet events. New
   events to WSOP Europe include two Short Deck events, two 8-Game Mixed
   events, including the €25,500 Mixed Games Championship starting Monday,
   October 21. Also new to WSOP Europe is the €1,350 Mini Main Event. The
   Mini Main Event was introduced to the WSOP earlier this year and it was
   a major hit at the Rio drawing 5,521 unique players. The Mini Main
   Event uses the same structure as the Main Event, just with accelerated
   blind levels.

   Not to forget some of the staple events of recent WSOP Europe, the €550
   Colossus returns to the schedule along with €550 PLO and the exciting
   €1,100 Turbo Bounty Hunter event.

   The combination of exciting new events and proven staple events will
   lead to an unforgettable series, but as always, the WSOP Europe Main
   Event still reigns as the premiere event on European soil.

   The WSOP Europe Main Event returns with no major changes. The buy-in
   will once again be €10,350, and once again King’s Resort and the WSOP
   are guaranteeing a €5 million prizepool for the event. Players will
   have the option of playing in one of the two starting flights or opting
   to wait and enter on Day 2 of the event. All players, regardless of
   when they enter for the first time, may use a single re-entry at any
   time during the registration period if they are eliminated. Flight A of
   the Main Event is scheduled for Friday, October 25 at noon and Flight B
   for Saturday, October 26 at noon. The surviving players will combine
   with all Day 2 entrants for Day 2 starting Sunday, October 27 at noon.

   Player of the Year

   The 2019 Player of the Year honors will go to the player who
   accumulates the most points in open WSOP and WSOP Europe events this
   calendar year. The race is tight at the top of the standings with just
   14 point-earning eligible events remaining. The $250,000 Super High
   Roller will not award Player of the Year points.

   The current leader is Australia’s Robert Campbell with 3,418 points. He
   had a monster summer at the Rio, earning his first two career gold
   bracelet and reaching four final tables. Right on his tail are big
   hitters Shaun Deeb (3,280) and Daniel Negreanu (3,166). Both Deeb and
   Negreanu are hoping to make WSOP Player of the Year history. A PoY win
   for Deeb will make him the first player to ever win the honor in
   back-to-back years, and a PoY win for Negreanu will give him the honor
   of being the only player to win the title three times. Rounding out the
   top 10 in the PoY standings are Daniel Zack (3,126), Phillip Hui
   (2,881), Jason Gooch (2,643), Joseph Cheong (2,595), David “ODB” Baker
   (2,480), Chris Ferguson (2,476), and Anthony Zinno (2,443).

THOMAS ALCORN WINS SOUTHERN INDIANA MAIN EVENT FOR $117,322

   October 08, 2019 - 12:19:55 AM EST
    |  Tyler Foran
   THOMAS ALCORN WINS SOUTHERN INDIANA MAIN EVENT FOR $117,322

   Thomas Alcorn is a recreational but as of recently his game has heavily
   padded his bankroll. He has played in three consecutive Circuit main
   events cashing in all three, Harrah’s Cherokee being the largest for
   $126,188 for his third-place finish.

   This retiree has taken $20,000 out of his recent winnings to travel to
   other events on the circuit and it has already paid off, defeating a
   field of 357 players in the 2019 Horseshoe Southern Indiana Circuit
   Main Event, earning his first World series of Poker Circuit ring and
   $117,322 and also earning his way into the 2020 Global Casino
   Championship.
   After winning the tournament Alcorn was asked how he feels, and he
   responded with a great big “Wahooo!” Followed by “a little bit of
   Yee-hah.” He says his success lately is mostly because of his unique
   strategy, knowing that the new generation of poker are raising and
   re-raising more often, he can get paid off when he has the better
   hands. “Even though I know the new strategy is very good, I do way less
   bluffing than the new style of poker. Everyone is so used to people
   betting their bluffs that I can get called when I am betting my
   monsters.” He explained, “The good players realise I am doing this, and
   they won’t bluff me, so I mess up their whole game.”

   Final Table Action

   All nine players managed to stick through the first level of play,
   despite many of them being under 15 big blind mark. Jesse Carter
   doubled through the eventual champion Thomas Alcorn the very first hand
   of the tournament when his pocket queens held after getting all of the
   chips in the middle preflop.

   WSOP Bracelet winner Brett Apter was the first of the final nine to be
   eliminated when he moved all-in preflop for his last nine and a half
   big blinds with ace-high but couldn’t hold against Alcorn’s queen-high
   that turned a pair of tens.

   David Winrich who seemed to be mostly card-dead until this point, had
   moved all-in for six big blinds with pocket fours, Alan Percal
   announced he was all-in as well for his 17 big blinds with Ace-King and
   right behind him John Gallaher called off his remaining stack with
   pocket kings which held, eliminating Winrich in eighth place and
   leaving Percal with less than a single big blind. Percal was eliminated
   by Robert James the very next hand in seventh place.

   The hand directly after that Nick Pupillo raised the button and Carter
   three-bet jammed his remaining stack that had already took a hit from
   Pupillo which Kenneth Ware came along as did Pupillo. Ware flopped a
   set of nines and shoved his remaining 11 big blinds and Pupillo called
   with his straight draw, drilling the straight on the turn and
   eliminating Carter and Ware in 6^th and 5h Place.

   After this double knock-out the four handed battle continued for some
   time before Pupillo found himself with just 10 big blinds and moved
   all-in preflop over top of James’ raise. James called with a classic
   race, James’ Jack-ten suited against Pupillo’s pocket fives but
   unfortunately for Pupillo he couldn’t fade the flop straight and flush
   draw to go along with his two over-cards and he drilled the pair of
   tens to deny Pupillo his fourth WSOP Circuit gold ring and eliminate
   him in 4^th Place.

   Gallaher had grinded a short-stack for some time, moving all-in preflop
   on multiple occasions with no contest before eventually running into
   James’ aces when he jammed the flop with his ace-high and a straight
   draw. He couldn’t connect with the straight and was sent to the payout
   desk in 3^rd place.

   Now it was James’ versus Alcorn in a marathon of a heads-up match, with
   both players repeating passing the chiplead back and forth. After
   almost five hours of heads up, Alcorn came out on top when James had
   moved all-in with pocket fives and got called by Alcorn’s ace-four
   suited. An ace came on the flop crushing James’ hope as he said, “Ah in
   the window!” and the board completed with Alcorn making trip aces to
   eliminate James in second place.

   On top of the money though, Alcorn has another reason to be excited
   about this win now earning a little bragging rights with Maurice
   Hawkins the all-time WSOPC ring leader who has 13 rings. “Maurice
   Hawkins and I used to play at the Seminole Hard Rock all the time. We
   wound up making final tables a lot, and he remembered me, he came up to
   me in one the tournaments, and I said, ‘Well, I’m gonna beat you
   today,’ and he replied ’12 rings!’ So next time I see him, I’m going to
   go up to him with one of these and go, ha!”

   Final Table Results:

   1: Thomas Alcorn - $117,322 & WSOP Circuit gold ring
   2:Robert James - $72,512
   3: John Gallaher - $52,190
   4: Nick Pupillo - $38,145
   5: Kenneth Ware - $28,318
   6: Jesse Carter - $21,358
   7: Alan Percal - $16,370
   8: David Winrich - $12,754
   9: Brett Apter - $10,103

    |  Anthony Thompson
   CIRCUIT RETURNS TO HORSESHOE HAMMOND THURSDAY

   Opening day features a multi-flight Ring Event that $500,000 guarantee
   with the Main Event carrying a $1.000,000 guarantee.

   Horseshoe Hammond Circuit series kicks off Thursday, October 10th.

   Hammond, Ind. (October 8, 2019) -- The World Series of Poker Circuit
   has already completed nine of the 35 stops on the 2019-2020 tour. The
   next stop on the Circuit schedule kicks off Thursday, October 10th at
   Horseshoe Hammond.

   The first three days of the series feature starting flights for Event
   #1: $400 No-Limit Hold'em Re-Entry. Last year at Horseshoe Hammond, the
   multi-flight, re-entry event started off with a bang gathering nearly
   2,600 entries. Along with the option of unlimited re-entry, Event #1
   boasts a $500,000 guaranteed prizepool.

   There will be 14 gold ring events held in total, including the $2,200
   buy-in, High Roller competition, and of course the $1,700 Main Event,
   which begins Friday, October 28th. The Main Event carries a guaranteed
   prizepool of $1,000,000. It's conclusion on Monday, October 23rd will
   bring the Chicago-area Circuit to an end.

   Last year's Main Event winner at Horseshoe Hammond was 72-year old
   dentist, Erik Vodovoz. Vodovoz bested a field of 1,050 players to win
   his first WSOP gold circuit ring and $294,290 in his Main Event
   conquest.

   The winner of the Main Event and the Casino Champion will earn a seat
   to the 2020 Global Casino Championship. There they will compete for a
   minimum $1 million prizepool, as well as a coveted gold bracelet. To
   become the Casino Champion a player must earn the most points at a
   given Circuit stop.

   Players earn points based on how well they finish in a tournament. More
   information on the Global Casino Championship leaderboard can be found
   on WSOP.com.
