   Lo bueno La configuración es rápida y sencilla si tus dispositivos
   están actualizados. Utiliza tecnología Miracast estándar que funciona
   con computadoras con Windows y algunos dispositivos con Android, sin
   necesidad de una red Wi-Fi tradicional.

   Lo malo Hay dispositivos similares, como Chromecast de Google, que
   cuestan menos. Debes estar preparado para suministrar tu propia
   alimentación eléctrica si no tienes un puerto USB con alimentación en
   tu monitor.

   Conclusión El adaptador Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter tiene
   competidores serios, como las unidades Chromecast y Roku, pero puede
   resultar útil para viajeros y personas de negocios que confían en
   Windows 8.

   El adaptador Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter (Microsoft WDA) hace
   exactamente lo que indica su nombre. Ofrece una manera de pasar tu
   pantalla (con audio) desde una computadora o dispositivo con Android a
   tu televisor. El adaptador se conecta a tu televisor o proyector por
   HDMI y se alimenta por USB. El dispositivo no hace más que esto. No
   tiene aplicaciones propias y requiere un dispositivo fuente para
   usarlo.

   Este adaptador utiliza Miracast, una tecnología que emplea Wi-Fi Direct
   para comunicarse entre dispositivos. Esto significa que tu PC y el
   adaptador no necesitan comunicarse a través de un enrutador común, ya
   que generan una red punto a punto. Puede que esto no te suene muy
   impactante, pero si tenemos en cuenta su tamaño tan pequeño, el
   adaptador Wireless Display Adapter es portátil y puede llevarse
   fácilmente de la sala de conferencias a la habitación del hotel.

   A US$59 en los Estados Unidos, Microsoft tiene una dura competencia con
   dispositivos como Chromecast de Google ($35) y varias cajas Roku,
   incluyendo el Roku Streaming Stick, disponible por US$50. Sin embargo,
   gracias a la integración con Miracast y al esfuerzo de Microsoft por
   emparejar este dispositivo con la línea de tabletas Surface Pro, el
   adaptador Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter puede resultar útil en tu
   bolso de viaje.

Diseño y características

   El adaptador Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter es un dispositivo
   rectangular y discreto, similar a una unidad USB. Mide 9 cm (3.5 in) de
   largo y pesa 33.1 g (1.2 oz). Tiene un conector HDMI y un cable USB
   corto, conectado de forma permanente al cuerpo del dispositivo. El
   adaptador utiliza el USB como alimentación. Si tu televisor no tiene un
   puerto USB con alimentación (o si no tienes uno de estos puertos
   cerca), tendrás que conseguir un cable USB de extensión y una fuente de
   alimentación USB. Microsoft no los incluye en la caja. Sin embargo, sí
   incluye un pequeño cable de extensión HDMI en caso de que lo necesites.

Configuración relativamente sencilla

   Conectar el adaptador Wireless Display Adapter es bastante sencillo.
   Conéctalo al puerto HDMI de tu televisor o receptor y luego conecta el
   USB. Ve a la entrada HDMI correspondiente en tu televisor y verás una
   pantalla negra y un logotipo de Microsoft con el nombre de tu Display
   Adapter y el mensaje "Ready to connect" ("listo para conectar").

   Actualmente, el adaptador es compatible con dispositivos con Windows
   8.1 y Miracast habilitado, como la línea
   Surface Pro los dispositivos con Android 4.4 y funciones Miracast, como
   el teléfono Google Nexus 5 o tableta

   Nexus 7 (2013) de Google.

   Para una PC con Windows, tendrás que comprobar que el sistema operativo
   esté actualizado y añadir una pantalla inalámbrica activando la barra
   de botones de acceso y seleccionando Dispositivos > Proyectar > Agregar
   una pantalla inalámbrica. En Android, debes ir a Configuración >
   Pantalla > Proyectar pantalla, luego presionar el ícono de menú y
   habilitar la pantalla inalámbrica.

Está conectado, ¿ahora qué?

   El adaptador Wireless Display Adapter es simplemente eso: un adaptador.
   No hace nada por sí solo, simplemente espera a que algo le envíe
   contenido. Puede mostrar contenido de hasta 1,920 x 1,080 y produce
   audio en estéreo de dos canales y sonido envolvente 5.1.

Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter review: Beam your laptop or tablet screen
to your TV

   An up-to-date Surface Pro 3 found the adapter quickly. Once you follow
   Microsoft's directions to project to the Wireless Display Adapter,
   you'll see your screen appear on your TV in a few seconds. The Surface
   Pro 3's display becomes letter-boxed to match a standard 16:9
   television.

   There is the tiniest amount of lag between devices. Swipes and videos
   are slightly behind on the mirrored display, so this isn't ideal for
   gaming. The adapter is more about being able to present or share things
   on a big screen. Video and PowerPoint presentations are examples of
   content a device such as this is designed to share.

   As the signal mirrors your PC, you're are not limited by specific apps.
   If it runs on your Windows 8.1 machine, you will be able to see it on
   your TV including DRM-bound iTunes videos. Additionally, you can use
   your TV as a second or extended monitor with your computer instead of
   just mirroring. In that case, you'll probably want a trackpad or mouse
   attached so you can control your things on the second display.

   Since the adapter uses Miracast, certain Android devices can also
   mirror their displays. I tested this function with a Nexus 7 (2013).
   Screen mirroring worked quite well, although the different aspect
   ratios of the tablet and my television meant pillar bars around the
   mirrored output.

   The closer you are to the Wireless Display Adapter, the better
   everything looks. Microsoft says you'll get a 23-foot range. In my
   small apartment, that range was definitely impeded by a wall and the
   connection between the tablet and adapter was lost at a distance of
   about 15 feet.

   If you're worried about multiple devices being able to take over the
   Wireless Display Adapter, do not fear. The adapter is locked to
   whatever device is connected to it at the time. A second device cannot
   hijack your TV just because it can see the Wireless Display Adapter;
   you'd have to disconnect it from the original device first.

Against the competition

   The main competitors for the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter are the
   Chromecast and the Roku Streaming Stick, both tiny, gumstick-sized
   devices and both slightly less expensive.

   The whole thing boils down to usage. If you're thinking about adding
   yet another device to your home theater, the Microsoft Wireless Display
   Adapter does not make a lot of sense. A Roku stick or box can be
   purchased at about the same price and the Roku wouldn't need a second
   device to feed it content. Additionally, other Miracast-enabled devices
   like Western Digital's WD TV offer screen mirroring along with apps
   that stream online and local content for about $25 more.

   If you use Windows 8.1 and want a quick way to get anything from your
   tablet to your TV, that's when Microsoft's dongle makes the most sense.
   A Chromecast provides similar functionality with its "Cast this tab"
   feature on the Chrome browser, but is limited to whatever is visible in
   your browser tab.

   The Wireless Display Adapter appears to be best for use on the road.
   Other devices need to be connected to the same router to see each
   other, and if you bring a Chromecast on the road, you'll still need to
   bring a hotspot and create a network for your Chromecast and phone to
   both join. However, the Wireless Display Adapter uses Wi-Fi Direct to
   set up a connection between your devices, no extra router required.
   This is very useful for watching video in a hotel room or handling a
   presentation without having to set up too much extra equipment.

Conclusion

   Microsoft doesn't promise you the world with its Wireless Display
   Adapter, the device simply allows you to mirror or extend your machine
   to an HDMI-equipped display. If you love living in a Windows world or
   need an on-the-go media companion to your Android or Windows device,
   this adapter is a winner. However, in the home theater space, it's hard
   to beat using a Chromecast with any computer or with the growing number
   of apps that support Chromecast. Alternatively, your living room would
   be better served by any number of Roku boxes that require no extra
   device to drive the content.

Google Nexus Player análisis: Nexus Player: Android TV necesita más apps,
menos enfoque en servicios de Google

   Lo bueno El Google Nexus Player ofrece una buena búsqueda por voz
   convencional que incluye un control remoto físico. Si usas tu teléfono
   o tableta para transmitir apps compatibles, ofrece acceso a los
   servicios más importantes. Ofrece juegos de Android a una pantalla
   grande y es compatible con controles Bluetooth (opcionales).

   Lo malo En el lanzamiento, la selección de apps nativos es abismal en
   comparación con Roku, Apple TV y Amazon Fire TV. La interfaz parece
   diseñada para empujar a los usuarios hacia los servicios de Google y la
   función de búsqueda por voz no funciona en apps de terceros, como lo
   son Netflix y Hulu Plus. La conectividad es escasa, sin conexión a
   Ethernet, y 8GB de almacenamiento es muy poco para los ansiosos
   'gamers'.

   Conclusión Hasta que reciba una gran infusión de apps nativos y soporte
   de desarrolladores, al igual que una mejor integración con otros
   servicios diferentes a los de Google, el Nexus Player con Android TV no
   ofrece ninguna actualización sobre los otros dispositivos de
   'streaming'.

   ¿Necesita el mundo otro dispositivo de streaming? ¿Otra plataforma de
   apps para la sala? Con el Nexus Player y el sistema operativo Android
   TV la respuesta de Google es: "Claro, ¿por qué no?"

   ¿Nuestra respuesta? "No compres este todavía".

   Como muchos productos de lanzamiento de Google, el Nexus Player, el
   primer dispositivo para el consumidor en correr Android TV, necesita
   más tiempo de desarrollo. Los dispositivos con plataformas de streaming
   mejoran con el tiempo (bueno, usualmente) y estoy seguro que Android TV
   madurará en los próximos meses y años, pero en este momento es tan solo
   una foca bebé colocada en una piscina repleta de tiburones.

   Roku, Apple TV y hasta Amazon Fire TV -- especialmente el nuevo Fire TV
   Stick de US$39 -- son los temidos tiburones blancos en esta analogía y,
   por ahora, el Nexus Player es solo un compinche en la piscina. Su
   principal problema, la carencia de apps, está acompañada por una
   interfaz que con insistencia te busca llevar a un destino de contenido
   poco popular, Google Play Movies y TV. Añade un precio relativamente
   alto y escasa conectividad y el Player es difícil de recomendar a
   cualquiera que no sea un fanático de Google -- que probablemente
   continuará viendo de todas maneras Google Play en sus Rokus.

   Android TV tiene unos fundamentos sólidos sobre los cuales construir.
   Aunque limitada por ahora, la función de búsquedas por voz funciona muy
   bien y es fácilmente una de las mejores funciones. El Player puede
   hacer todo lo que puede hacer el Chromecast de US$35, principalmente la
   transmisión de contenido y pantalla. Los más experimentados y fanáticos
   podrán desbloquear más funciones, similar a como lo han hecho con los
   teléfonos Android rooteados y con ROMs especiales. Google, por su
   parte, promociona la naturaleza abierta de la plataforma y la
   participación de los desarrolladores de apps para que ayuden a
   mejorarlo. Nuevamente, hizo una promesa similar con Google TV, el cual
   fracasó.

   Android TV estará llegando en televisores, además de cajas y, muy
   seguramente, aparatitos similares al Chromecast en un futuro. El
   soporte de apps se expandirá, la búsqueda por voz tendrá como objetivo
   llegar a más servicio y los precios caerán. Hasta entonces, deja pasar
   al Nexus Player y espera que Android TV vea crecer sus propios dientes.

El dispositivo de streaming se une al círculo

   Cuando los primeros dispositivos de su clase y diseño fueron
   presentados en 2010 -- la segunda generación de Apple TV y los Rokus --
   tenían un diseño compacto, minimalista y diferente. Hoy, es un diseño
   estándar.

   photos 19 Desde la izquierda como las manecillas del reloj: Fire TV,
   Apple TV, Roku 3, Nexus Player y Chromecast Sarah Tew/CNET

   La caja, fabricada por Asus, mide 12 cm en diámetro, por 1.9 cm de alto
   -- es sólo un poco más alto que la Fire TV.

   El Nexus Player no ofrece ninguna luz indicativa aparte de la luz LED
   azul en la parte inferior que brilla durante operaciones. No tiene
   botones, aparte del botón en la parte inferior para emparejar
   dispositivos Bluetooth, como un control de videojuegos o un teclado.

El control: no es excelente, pero es mejor que nada

   El control remoto incluido es mejor que el del Chromecast, porque al
   menos existe. No es tan bueno como los controles de otras cajas, pero
   cumple con su trabajo.

   La mínima selección de botones es similar al control del Apple TV.
   Prefiero la distribución de los botones del Roku o del Fire TV, con
   botones dedicados a retroceder o adelantar, pero Apple y Nexus hacen
   que usemos el control del cursor. Un círculo inescrutable, no el
   estándar con forma de casa, te llega al menú principal. Como el Fire
   TV, el botón con el micrófono activa los comandos de voz, acompañado de
   una luz LED cuando el micrófono integrado al control está escuchando.

   El botón circular de Asus no se siente tan sólido y placentero como los
   otros. El de Amazon, con su acabado suave, es mi favorito. El control
   del Nexus usa Bluetooth, entonces, al igual que Roku y Fire TV, no
   necesita estar apuntando directamente al dispositivo para que funcione.

   Google también tiene un app de Android que te permite controlar el
   Nexus Player.

Rápido, procesador apto para juegos, pero poca conectividad

   Si usas al Nexus Player para videojuegos, estarás feliz de conocer su
   potente procesador Intel Atom de cuatro núcleos de 1.8GHz y sus
   gráficas Imagination PowerVR Series 3 Graphics 2D/3D Engine. También
   tiene 1GB de RAM y 8GB de almacenamiento.

   El dispositivo de Amazon tiene especificaciones similares aparte del
   doble de RAM (2GB), mientras que Roku y Apple TV tienen
   especificaciones menos potentes, al menos en escritura. El Nexus Player
   también tiene Bluetooth (4.1) y Wi-Fi 802.11 (ac) más nuevos que el
   Fire TV.

   La conectividad es escasa en comparación con los otros dispositivos: un
   puerto HDMI (1080p/60), un micro-USB (versión 2.0) y un conector de
   electricidad. No hay entrada analógica de video o salida de audio
   óptico digital, no hay opción de conectar un cable de Ethernet, si así
   lo quieres, (el Nexus Player funciona sólo en Wi-Fi) y no tiene ranura
   SD (ni tampoco microSD).

Triste selección de apps nativos, por ahora

   Aquí es donde el Nexus Player y Android TV reciben bofetadas por todas
   partes. El número de apps "nativos" en el Nexus Player -- los que
   puedes acceder desde el menú principal y puedes descargar desde la
   Google Play Store (y de hecho poner en marcha) -- actualmente está muy
   limitado, muy atrás de Roku, Apple TV y Amazon Fire TV.

   Puedes tener acceso a muchos más apps usando la tecnología de
   transmisión como el Chromecast.

   Vi HBG Go, Watch ESPN, Bloomberg TV y Vudu y todas las compatibles para
   transmisión, sin ningún problema usando mi teléfono y el Nexus Player.
   Pude transmitir apps compatibles, como Netflix,con navegadores a través
   de computadoras con Windows y Mac Yosemite. No hay una diferencia
   notable entre la transmisión del Nexus Player y el Chromecast -- los
   dos funcionan genial.

   El problema es que para hacer esto tienes que usar tu teléfono, tableta
   o PC, abrir el app y comenzar la transmisión.
   Sarah Tew/CNET

   Así que teniendo en cuenta la jerarquía de acceso a apps con facilidad
   -- apps nativos en la parte superior (marcadas con "Sí" en la tabla de
   abajo), seguida de los apps y sitios compatibles para transmisión tipo
   Chromecast y Apple AirPlay, y finalmente la transmisión de una pestaña
   de Chrome y otras soluciones de transmisión de pantalla -- aquí está
   una versión revisada de nuestra tabla de comparación de servicios por
   plataforma.

   este momento". Ella mencionó el nuevo SDK de Android TV para nuevos
   juegos y apps.

Nerdier tests: TabCasting and sideloading

   TabCasting using a Windows PC and Chrome browser worked just as well as
   via Chromecast. Web pages loaded fine, but with video I often
   experienced sub-par quality even with a powerful computer and a fast
   network. I watched "The Hunger Games" on Amazon Instant, for example,
   and although it did play, the image was quite soft and subject to
   stutter and hitching motion during camera movement. Via Fire TV or
   Roku's Amazon app, it looked pristine.

   Like Android for phones and tablets Android TV is "open," creating the
   possibility that developers (official and otherwise) will come up with
   ways to augment the app selection more quickly than Google itself. I
   tried one such early solution, Sideload Launcher by Chainfire, but
   couldn't find any compatible apps, or ways to get them onto the device.

   Aside from the main Android TV menu, you can also access apps from the
   Google Play store -- another kind of sideloading or at least "stealth"
   availability. Ones that are compatible with the Nexus Player can then
   be pushed to the device, as long as it's associated with your Google
   account. Most we tried are not compatible (the Nexus option is grayed
   out), but at least one, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, was able to be
   downloaded and played fine, even though it's not listed as an option
   anywhere on the Android TV interface. I assume it will arrive soon;
   Google's rep didn't provide any more information when I asked about
   this issue.

   I'm sure there will be plenty of hacks available soon to open up more
   apps, via the Play store and otherwise, for intrepid users. For now,
   however, the Amazon Fire TV offers better sideloading potential.

Interface pushes Google Play services

   When most people I know actually rent or buy an individual movie, TV
   show or album today, it happens on one or two platforms: iTunes or
   Amazon. But did you know Google has its own service, Google Play Movies
   and TV? What about Google Music? They actually exist, but almost nobody
   uses them.

   Annoyingly, they're front-and-center along with YouTube on the Android
   TV interface. We complained about Fire TV's interface pushing Amazon
   content, but at least Amazon has a popular media service. The same goes
   for Apple TV with iTunes. But neither one is as "pushy" as Android TV
   with Google services.

   The tiled interface looks a lot like the Xbox One's at first glance.
   It's very responsive on the powerful Nexus Player and has a relatively
   clean, uncluttered look with a central bar of four large thumbnails,
   above a row of icons for apps, another for games. Search is rightly
   prominent, and I like that the background changes to reflect the
   currently highlighted item.

   At first the bar seems like a great way to surface recently watched or
   useful content from multiple services, but during my time with the
   device it only seemed to display (upsell?) things from Google's
   services, including YouTube. Scrolling far enough to the right I did
   hit a recently watched show from Hulu Plus, but no matter how many
   Netflix shows I watched, one never appeared there.

   Prominent thumbnails showed The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy, for
   example, but when I selected them the only choices offered were
   pay-per-episode ($1.99 and up) or Season passes ($9.99 and up) on
   Google Play. As a Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriber I could watch most
   of those episodes for free, but since Android TV doesn't surface
   results from those services, via the main interface or search (voice or
   text), it feels like it's trying to rip me off.

   Again, we had similar complaints about Apple TV and especially Amazon
   Fire TV. Roku, meanwhile, offers an interface that's blissfully
   agnostic and customizable, and universal search that hits all of these
   services and more, allowing you to choose the "free" shows you have
   access to and easily decide which service to buy from. It also, as of
   last week, also supports Google Play.

Limited voice search that works

   As with Fire TV, the most impressive feature of the Nexus Player was a
   voice search that consistently, correctly recognized stuff I said. I
   conducted a brief test comparing the two boxes' voice search and they
   were both very good at recognizing TV show title names, for example.

   Even more impressive is how Android TV performed with more general
   searches, beating out Fire TV handily. "Fantasy movies" was recognized
   by both but the Nexus' results were much more relevant, with "The Lord
   of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" prominent (compared with "Inkheart"
   and "Ashura" among Amazon's top results). "Science fiction new
   releases" worked better on Google, too, with relevant movies, YouTube
   videos and TV shows broken out separately ("Transformers: Age of
   Extinction," Divergent," "The 100," and "Marvel's Agents of
   S.H.I.E.L.D," for example). Meanwhile, Amazon delivered "Primeval"
   (2007 TV show) and "The X-Files" (1993) among its top results.

   Android TV's result for "What are the worst shows on television?" Sarah
   Tew/CNET

   Again, the problem with Android TV's search is that results from
   Netflix, Hulu Plus and other apps are not returned. Instead you're just
   funneled once more to results from Google TV and Movies, Google Music
   or YouTube.

   Fire TV, by contrast, can return results from Crackle and Hulu Plus
   (Netflix results, albeit promised, are still MIA), although those
   results are presented on a secondary screen after any result from
   Amazon Instant Video. Roku, it bears repeating, searches more services
   than anyone and presents them according to cost--and using the Roku app
   for iOS or Android, you can also search via voice.

   Google is depending on developers to expand voice search too. A
   spokesperson told me, "We provide an open API for any app to support
   voice search. DailyMotion and DramaFever are a couple of early partners
   that have implemented this and we're expecting many more!"

   At the moment, hitting the Nexus remote's voice search button while
   within an app like Netflix or Hulu Plus has no effect, while Amazon's
   always seems to be accessible. Google told me that apps that do support
   voice search, when they become available, will allow it once you're
   within the app.

   RipTide GP2 on the Nexus Player Sarah Tew/CNET

Gaming: Better controls than a phone, but limited

   Judging from the tepid response to Fire TV and PlayStation TV , there's
   little pent-up demand for a "micro-console" that plays less demanding
   games on the big screen. But if you're someone who enjoys that sort of
   thing, the Nexus Player should work just as well as the Fire TV.

   One game we tried extensively, Riptide GP 3, played smoothly and looked
   as good as we expected on a 60-inch LCD TV. I played a round or two
   with Scott Stein using the same game on the Fire TV and while I thought
   they both responded similarly, he felt the Fire TV was a tad smoother.

   I also played Modern Combat 4 and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on both
   devices. Both looked softer than Riptide on the big screen and the
   controls on the shooter seemed a bit laggier, but both were still very
   playable, and basically the same on both devices.

   I also encountered some bugs and glitches. Trying to install The
   Walking Dead, it just kept booting me out of the menu and never worked.
   Badland, included on my test unit, failed to launch at all. At one
   point the Nexus player hung during Modern Combat's initial load and I
   had to back out to the main menu to get it to respond, but that was a
   minor glitch that didn't come up again. Your mileage may vary.

   The optional $40 game controller. Sarah Tew/CNET

   Between the two optional controllers, I definitely preferred Fire TV's
   with its offset, Xbox-style thumbsticks and play/pause media buttons,
   but both felt solid enough and made playing the game significantly
   easier than using a touchscreen. Nexus is also compatible with other
   Bluetooth controllers, like Nyko's.

   Just like apps, the selection of games on Fire TV is better than on
   Android TV for now. That said, your favorite game might be "stealth"
   available via the Google Play store as I described above with Grand
   Theft Auto: San Andreas. More games are appearing quickly, too; a
   couple new titles popped up over the weekend prior to this review
   publishing, including Final Fantasy III and The Wolf Among Us.

   The main limitation for gamers is storage space. Both the Nexus Player
   and Fire TV have a relatively paltry, nonexpandable 8GB, which a few
   fat games will eat up in no time. With just a few small apps and
   Riptide, Modern Combat, GTA and the non-functional Badlands installed
   on the Player, I got the dreaded "Your device is out of space. To
   uninstall apps you don't want, go to Settings > Apps" message when I
   tried to add The Walking Dead: Season 2.

Conclusion

   If Android TV simply added native apps for Amazon, HBO Go and Spotify
   it would instantly become competitive with those other platforms,
   especially if it came in a device that cost less than $100 (cough, Fire
   TV stick, cough). But for now that's not happening, and honestly I'd be
   surprised if Amazon, perhaps the most versatile video streaming app of
   them all, ever hit Android TV.

   The world is moving toward forcing users into one ecosystem or another,
   which makes nonpartisan devices without skin in the game, namely Roku,
   that much more valuable. I still have hope that Android TV can be a
   similarly agnostic and recommendable platform, but right now it simply
   isn't.
