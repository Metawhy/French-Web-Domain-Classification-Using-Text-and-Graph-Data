Introducing Pixy2

   (Click on the video to see the full-length version.)

Robot vision made easier

   Pixy2 is smaller, faster and more capable than the original Pixy.  Like
   its predecessor, Pixy2 can learn to detect objects that you teach it,
   just by pressing a button.  Additionally, Pixy2 has new algorithms that
   detect and track lines for use with line-following robots.  The new
   algorithms can detect intersections and “road signs” as well. The road
   signs can tell your robot what to do, such as turn left, turn right,
   slow down, etc.  And Pixy2 does all of this at 60 frames-per-second, so
   your robot can be fast, too.

   Use Pixy2 for lots of different applications, find a project, or use
   Pixy2 for something no one has considered!

Connect directly to Arduino or Raspberry Pi

   No need to futz around with tiny wires — Pixy2 comes with a special
   cable to plug directly into an Arduino and a USB cable to plug into a
   Raspberry Pi, so you can get started quickly.  No Arduino or Raspberry
   Pi?  No problem!  Pixy2 has several interfaces (SPI, I2C, UART, and
   USB) and simple communications, so you get your chosen controller
   talking to Pixy2 in short order.

Simplify your programming

   To get you up and running as fast as possible, we offer software
   libraries for Arduino and Raspberry Pi.  Pixy2 makes your programs
   simpler by only sending the data you’re looking for.  For example, if
   you teach Pixy2 a purple object, you will only receive data (X-Y
   coordinates, size, and unique ID) about the purple objects that Pixy2
   detects.

Open software and hardware

   Want to dig deeper?  Pixy2 is entirely open-source — software,
   firmware, and hardware.  We also offer a helpful wiki, support forums,
   and email support.

And the best part…

   Pixy2 is available now!

   Hey Everybody!
   Hope your new year is going well! You know when someone asks what
   you’ve been up to, and you’ve been super busy, and you try to explain,
   but everything that comes out of your mouth sounds kind of lame? The
   last couple weeks have been like that. The focus has been on firmware
   and software. There’s been whole slew of tweaks, improvements and fixes
   all over the place, but nothing “huge”.  And so in that sense this
   update is pretty much the opposite of a cool demo, but to summarize,
   there’s been excellent progress lately, just not anything that can
   described with a cool pic or video.

   Much of the work has been focused on the color signatures and the code
   that generates them, such as getting the lookup tables to generate
   quickly and efficiently, writing a region growing routine to do a
   simple object segmentation during “teach” mode, and saving and loading
   the color signatures from flash. We’ve made good progress on the
   Arduino libraries. We’ve improved the image rendering modes in Pixymon
   and made them more general purpose. We ran into some memory issues,
   fixed them, uncovered a USB issue, fixed it. A Heap issue was uncovered
   and fixed. Many comments added. Lots of coffee consumed….. still
   reading? (sorry!)

   Manufacturing is ramping up. We have 4000 Pixys double-bagged and
   double-boxed, waiting patiently for lenses and firmware to make their
   little Pixy selves complete. We’re interviewing candidates to help with
   the Big Shipment and the tasks leading up to it. And we have little
   Pixy boxes. Here— take a look!
   Your Pixy will arrive all snug in this little box Your Pixy will arrive
   all snug in this little box

   OK, the schedule– we’re trying to stick to the dates we laid out 4
   weeks ago, namely feature completion the week of January 27 and
   start-ship the week February 17. We’re behind, but not hugely so, and
   trying to make up time wherever possible. We promise not to cut
   corners. The next couple weeks are the home stretch, or close to it,
   development-wise. We’ll be focusing more on Pixymon. There’s a cool
   feature (aspect?) of Pixymon that we’ve worked hard to maintain—
   Pixymon is a generic front-end and not tied to any particular algorithm
   (such as color blob analysis.) More on that in the next update as well
   as the status of the final push!

   As always, thank you so much for your interest, support, and patience!
   A slew of tweaks, improvements and fixes
