Privacy

   Last Updated: February 22, 2019

   Index Exchange, Inc. (“Index Exchange”) believes in all Internet users’
   rights to privacy. This Policy explains the information collection,
   use, and disclosure practices of Index Exchange. It applies to all
   information received by Index Exchange whether in electronic, paper or
   verbal format.

   THE INDEX EXCHANGE BUSINESS

   The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange (“Index Platform”)
   prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to
   Internet users. Our proprietary ad personalizationmethodologies enable
   advertisers to effectively direct their campaigns to the audience(s)
   they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices.
   Services offered by Index Exchange include a Web-based advertising
   exchange marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad
   networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile
   advertising and ad inventory.

   Through its ad server, Index Exchange also acts as a service provider
   to enable its publishers, advertisers, ad networks and other clients to
   collect and use data for advertising purposes on their digital and
   mobile platforms across the Internet.  Publishers may use our services
   to process consumer data, which they collect or source. Their data
   collection, use, and sharing practices may be governed by their own
   privacy policies and differ from those found in Index Exchange’s
   Privacy Policy. We encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of
   any websites you visit and apps you use, to learn about their privacy
   practices before disclosing any personal information to them.

    INDUSTRY SELF–REGULATION

   Index Exchange prides itself on conducting business in a transparent
   and open manner. In line with those values, we support efforts for
   self-regulation in the internet-based advertising industry.

    NAI

   Index Exchange is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising
   Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics
   companies committed to responsible data collection for digital
   advertising, building consumer awareness, and establishing responsible
   business and data management practices and standards. Index Exchange
   adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct in all its operations.

    DAA

   Index Exchange adheres to the standards and practices outlined by The
   Digital Advertising Alliance, a consortium of the leading national
   advertising and marketing trade associations, promoting a
   self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising. More
   information on the program can be found here.

    INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING

   In general, like most standard website servers, Index Exchange uses log
   files to track transactions. These log files include internet protocol
   (IP) addresses, browser types used, postal or zip codes, the internet
   service provider (ISP) utilised, referring/exit pages, platform type,
   date/time stamps, device IDs, and number of clicks among others. This
   information is then used to analyze trends, administer the site, and
   personalizeadvertisements to users accordingly. Index Exchange does not
   collect a website user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as
   defined under United States federal law. However, in the course of and
   for purposes of conducting its business, Index Exchange may collect and
   process the following consumer information that is considered Personal
   Information (PI)  under the Canadian Personal Information Protection
   and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) or Personal Data under the
   European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

   (1) browser and device information received from publishers is shared
   with advertisers and agencies for responding to requests for
   advertisements, forecast advertising inventory and troubleshooting any
   operation issues related to the Index Platform;

   (2) IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 are used to bid on
   advertising inventory;

   (3) geo-location data is used to bid on advertising inventory;

   (4) Precise Location Data (data obtained from a device about the
   physical location of the device) is used to bid on advertising
   inventory;

   (5) GPS coordinates, where available;

   (6) unique Index Exchange UserIDs, stored in browser cookies, are used
   for profiles on the ad server;

   (7) mobile device identifiers are used to understand mobile traffic and
   are shared with advertisers and agencies to personalize the advertising
   experience;

   (8) Pixel Data (data obtained through or in connection with the
   placement of any pixel mechanism) is used as part of the user matching
   process;

   (9) people identifiers provided by Index Exchange’s partners are
   associated to audience segments, and shared with advertisers and
   agencies;

   (10) data on whether a user viewed or clicked on an Ad is shared with
   advertisers and agencies.

   Index Exchange’s internal processes treat personal data in accordance
   with regulatory requirements and applicable privacy laws to ensure that
   information is stored securely and used only for allowed and intended
   purposes.

   Index Exchange may combine information that does not directly identify
   an individual with data collected from other sources to provide
   publishers, advertisers and ad networks with information to improve the
   relevance of advertising presented to users and determine whether to
   bid on ad inventory. In addition, although Index Exchange does not
   directly engage in Cross-App Advertising, our technology may collect
   and/or pass through Mobile Device IDs (the unique identifier assigned
   to a device by the manufacturer) or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and
   later), instead of cookies, to recognize you.

    Do Not Track Signal

   Index Exchange does not honor the ‘DNT’ browser signal. Instead, we
   utilize the cookie based opt-out mechanisms to allow users to opt-out
   of all advertising. For more information, please see the “Your Choices”
   section below.

   Cross–Device Linking

   Cross-Device Linking is the process of making assumptions that certain
   devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same
   user/household. Index Exchange may engage in Cross Device Linking for
   personalized advertising, ad delivery, and reporting. If you would like
   to opt-out of having Cross-Device Linking used by Index Exchange on
   your devices, please see the “Your Choices” section below.

   Cookies (HTTP Cookies and HTML5 Cookies or Local Storage)

   An HTTP cookie is an object that stores a small amount of data on
   behalf of a browser on a given device.  By saving information in a
   cookie, websites can remember preferences or recognize browsers from
   one visit to another or from one website to another. Index Exchange
   uses both session-only and persistent cookies. More specifically, Index
   Exchange uses certain cookies that last only for the duration of a
   user’s internet session and expire when that user closes his or her
   browser, as well as certain other cookies that are used to remember a
   user when he or she returns to a website and will last for longer.

   HTML5 cookies, also known as HTML5 Web Storage, or local storage, is a
   technology that allows a website or application to store information
   locally on a user’s computer or mobile device. Index Exchange uses
   HTML5 cookies, or local storage, in connection with its platform and
   website to support publisher monetization objectives and speed up page
   load time.

   Index Exchange ultimately uses these technologies (referred to as
   “cookies” going forward)  to facilitate transactions between buyers and
   sellers of digital advertising inventory and, among other things, to
   enable its demand-side partners, publishers, data management platforms,
   and other third-party clients (collectively referred to as “Index
   Exchange clients/partners” moving forward) to effectively: (a) target
   advertisements to users of digital media properties, (b) evaluate and
   assess their advertisements and campaigns; and (c) view and enforce
   user opt-out choices. Index Exchange’s platform further uses cookies to
   associate information that does not directly identify an individual
   user with browsers and devices, so that Index Exchange’s platform and
   Index Exchange clients/partners can then use the information to select
   advertisements and campaigns for delivery via the Index Exchange
   platform. Index Exchange engages in cookie syncing, which is the
   matching of Index Exchange cookie IDs to Index Exchange
   clients’/partners’ cookie IDs.

   Index Exchange collects and stores IDs from a variety of domains,
   including adsrvr.org and casalemedia.com. These IDs are stored in
   either Index Exchange’s domain (casalemedia.com) or the publisher’s
   first party domain.

   PII, PI, and Personal Data of Index Exchange Clients

   Registering to become a member of the Index Platform and use of the
   Index Exchange User Interface, either as an advertiser or a publisher,
   requires the submission of PI, PII or Personal Data to Index Exchange.
   This can include the full name, mailing and/or billing address, email
   address, company name, and website URL. Index Exchange uses this
   information to service its accounts and respond to inbound inquiries
   related to sales or technical support requests. Communications to
   business users are related to the Advertising Exchange. The Index
   Exchange User Interface also uses Google Analytics technology to
   monitor traffic on the UI. All such information submitted is held by
   Index Exchange in strict confidence and as prescribed by corresponding
   regulatory authorities.

   Index Exchange does not engage in any form of distribution or sale of
   PII, PI or Personal Data to third parties for their own promotional
   use. Index Exchange does not sell, supply, or otherwise make user PII,
   PI or Personal Data available to any third party under any
   circumstances, unless ordered to do so by a court of competent
   jurisdiction.

   Information Obtained from Third Parties

   Index Exchange may obtain data from third party companies for the
   purpose of informing ad selection. This data may include Personal Data
   as defined under the GDPR. Advertisers who are clients of Index
   Exchange may collect PII and Personal Data on their own websites. These
   details are provided directly by the individual Internet user through
   online order forms, contests, etc. PII or Personal Data provided
   through an advertiser’s website is not visible to Index Exchange while
   being entered, nor provided to Index Exchange at any time in the
   future. This personal data collected by the advertiser is subject to
   the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved.

   YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

   Web Browser Option to Opt–Out

   Some of the ads you see on the internet or in applications on your
   mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity
   online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad
   tailoring — sometimes called “interest-based” advertising — is enabled
   through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile
   advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies.
   Tailored digital ads help support the free products, services and
   content you enjoy online. To help protect your privacy, Index Exchange
   (along with other NAI members) has voluntarily agreed to abide by high
   NAI standards including offering an opt-out mechanism.

   Opting out of interest-based advertising means that you will no longer
   be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests. It does not
   mean you will no longer see advertising online. When you opt-out, an
   opt-out cookie will be stored in your web browser signaling your
   opt-out preference to NAI members including Index Exchange.

   Please note that if your browser is configured to block third-party
   cookies, then the opt out cookie may not work. If you delete your
   browser cookies, you will need to opt out again. The opt-out will not
   apply to the specific browser in which you set it. The opt-out process
   must be repeated for each different browser.

   TO BE DISCLOSED TO A THIRD PARTY OR TO BE USED FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS
   MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PURPOSE(S) FOR WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY
   COLLECTED OR FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANY
   PURPOSE(S) SUBSEQUENTLY AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL.

   AUTHORIZED, INDEX EXCHANGE INC. WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT

   DATA RETENTION

   Index Exchange may retain data for as long as needed to provide
   services. We may retain data even after an account has been closed or
   is no longer engaged in business with Index Exchange if retention is
   reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations or meet
   regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or
   enforce our Privacy Policy or our contractual obligations. We also
   retain personal data for as long as is necessary to provide
   support-related reporting and trend analysis which is thirteen (13)
   months. After 13 months, we de-personalize data by creating data sets
   that cannot be traced back to individuals. Personal data will be
   destroyed according to our data destruction process.

   INFORMATION SECURITY

   Index Exchange follows strict Information Security policies to protect
   personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
   receive it. Although we take steps to secure your information, no
   method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
   storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
   acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its
   absolute security.

   In the unlikely event of a confirmed security breach, Index Exchange
   will investigate and contact impacted persons within 72 hours of the
   breach.

   We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law,
   in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court
   order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other
   government agency; when we believe that disclosure is necessary to
   protect or exercise our legal rights; or to defend against legal
   claims.

   EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS RESIDENTS

   Index Exchange transfers data from the European Union and Switzerland
   to the United States in accordance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy
   Shield Frameworks. More information on the Privacy Shield program set
   forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce can be found
   at https://www.privacyshield.gov/eu-us-framework.

   Index Exchange is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
   of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for any violations of the EU-US or
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Index Exchange may be held
   responsible if third party controllers to whom it transfers personal
   information or third party agents it engages to process this data on
   its behalf, act in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield
   Principles. Index Exchange is required to disclose personal information
   in response to lawful requests to meet national security or law
   enforcement requirements.

Privacy

   Last Updated: February 22, 2019

   Index Exchange, Inc. (“Index Exchange”) believes in all Internet users’
   rights to privacy. This Policy explains the information collection,
   use, and disclosure practices of Index Exchange. It applies to all
   information received by Index Exchange whether in electronic, paper or
   verbal format.

   THE INDEX EXCHANGE BUSINESS

   The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange (“Index Platform”)
   prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to
   Internet users. Our proprietary ad personalizationmethodologies enable
   advertisers to effectively direct their campaigns to the audience(s)
   they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices.
   Services offered by Index Exchange include a Web-based advertising
   exchange marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad
   networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile
   advertising and ad inventory.

   Through its ad server, Index Exchange also acts as a service provider
   to enable its publishers, advertisers, ad networks and other clients to
   collect and use data for advertising purposes on their digital and
   mobile platforms across the Internet.  Publishers may use our services
   to process consumer data, which they collect or source. Their data
   collection, use, and sharing practices may be governed by their own
   privacy policies and differ from those found in Index Exchange’s
   Privacy Policy. We encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of
   any websites you visit and apps you use, to learn about their privacy
   practices before disclosing any personal information to them.

    INDUSTRY SELF–REGULATION

   Index Exchange prides itself on conducting business in a transparent
   and open manner. In line with those values, we support efforts for
   self-regulation in the internet-based advertising industry.

    NAI

   Index Exchange is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising
   Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics
   companies committed to responsible data collection for digital
   advertising, building consumer awareness, and establishing responsible
   business and data management practices and standards. Index Exchange
   adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct in all its operations.

    DAA

   Index Exchange adheres to the standards and practices outlined by The
   Digital Advertising Alliance, a consortium of the leading national
   advertising and marketing trade associations, promoting a
   self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising. More
   information on the program can be found here.

    INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING

   In general, like most standard website servers, Index Exchange uses log
   files to track transactions. These log files include internet protocol
   (IP) addresses, browser types used, postal or zip codes, the internet
   service provider (ISP) utilised, referring/exit pages, platform type,
   date/time stamps, device IDs, and number of clicks among others. This
   information is then used to analyze trends, administer the site, and
   personalizeadvertisements to users accordingly. Index Exchange does not
   collect a website user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as
   defined under United States federal law. However, in the course of and
   for purposes of conducting its business, Index Exchange may collect and
   process the following consumer information that is considered Personal
   Information (PI)  under the Canadian Personal Information Protection
   and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) or Personal Data under the
   European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

   (1) browser and device information received from publishers is shared
   with advertisers and agencies for responding to requests for
   advertisements, forecast advertising inventory and troubleshooting any
   operation issues related to the Index Platform;

   (2) IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 are used to bid on
   advertising inventory;

   (3) geo-location data is used to bid on advertising inventory;

   (4) Precise Location Data (data obtained from a device about the
   physical location of the device) is used to bid on advertising
   inventory;

   (5) GPS coordinates, where available;

   (6) unique Index Exchange UserIDs, stored in browser cookies, are used
   for profiles on the ad server;

   (7) mobile device identifiers are used to understand mobile traffic and
   are shared with advertisers and agencies to personalize the advertising
   experience;

   (8) Pixel Data (data obtained through or in connection with the
   placement of any pixel mechanism) is used as part of the user matching
   process;

   (9) people identifiers provided by Index Exchange’s partners are
   associated to audience segments, and shared with advertisers and
   agencies;

   (10) data on whether a user viewed or clicked on an Ad is shared with
   advertisers and agencies.

   Index Exchange’s internal processes treat personal data in accordance
   with regulatory requirements and applicable privacy laws to ensure that
   information is stored securely and used only for allowed and intended
   purposes.

   Index Exchange may combine information that does not directly identify
   an individual with data collected from other sources to provide
   publishers, advertisers and ad networks with information to improve the
   relevance of advertising presented to users and determine whether to
   bid on ad inventory. In addition, although Index Exchange does not
   directly engage in Cross-App Advertising, our technology may collect
   and/or pass through Mobile Device IDs (the unique identifier assigned
   to a device by the manufacturer) or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and
   later), instead of cookies, to recognize you.

    Do Not Track Signal

   Index Exchange does not honor the ‘DNT’ browser signal. Instead, we
   utilize the cookie based opt-out mechanisms to allow users to opt-out
   of all advertising. For more information, please see the “Your Choices”
   section below.

   Cross–Device Linking

   Cross-Device Linking is the process of making assumptions that certain
   devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same
   user/household. Index Exchange may engage in Cross Device Linking for
   personalized advertising, ad delivery, and reporting. If you would like
   to opt-out of having Cross-Device Linking used by Index Exchange on
   your devices, please see the “Your Choices” section below.

   Cookies (HTTP Cookies and HTML5 Cookies or Local Storage)

   An HTTP cookie is an object that stores a small amount of data on
   behalf of a browser on a given device.  By saving information in a
   cookie, websites can remember preferences or recognize browsers from
   one visit to another or from one website to another. Index Exchange
   uses both session-only and persistent cookies. More specifically, Index
   Exchange uses certain cookies that last only for the duration of a
   user’s internet session and expire when that user closes his or her
   browser, as well as certain other cookies that are used to remember a
   user when he or she returns to a website and will last for longer.

   HTML5 cookies, also known as HTML5 Web Storage, or local storage, is a
   technology that allows a website or application to store information
   locally on a user’s computer or mobile device. Index Exchange uses
   HTML5 cookies, or local storage, in connection with its platform and
   website to support publisher monetization objectives and speed up page
   load time.

   Index Exchange ultimately uses these technologies (referred to as
   “cookies” going forward)  to facilitate transactions between buyers and
   sellers of digital advertising inventory and, among other things, to
   enable its demand-side partners, publishers, data management platforms,
   and other third-party clients (collectively referred to as “Index
   Exchange clients/partners” moving forward) to effectively: (a) target
   advertisements to users of digital media properties, (b) evaluate and
   assess their advertisements and campaigns; and (c) view and enforce
   user opt-out choices. Index Exchange’s platform further uses cookies to
   associate information that does not directly identify an individual
   user with browsers and devices, so that Index Exchange’s platform and
   Index Exchange clients/partners can then use the information to select
   advertisements and campaigns for delivery via the Index Exchange
   platform. Index Exchange engages in cookie syncing, which is the
   matching of Index Exchange cookie IDs to Index Exchange
   clients’/partners’ cookie IDs.

   Index Exchange collects and stores IDs from a variety of domains,
   including adsrvr.org and casalemedia.com. These IDs are stored in
   either Index Exchange’s domain (casalemedia.com) or the publisher’s
   first party domain.

   PII, PI, and Personal Data of Index Exchange Clients

   Registering to become a member of the Index Platform and use of the
   Index Exchange User Interface, either as an advertiser or a publisher,
   requires the submission of PI, PII or Personal Data to Index Exchange.
   This can include the full name, mailing and/or billing address, email
   address, company name, and website URL. Index Exchange uses this
   information to service its accounts and respond to inbound inquiries
   related to sales or technical support requests. Communications to
   business users are related to the Advertising Exchange. The Index
   Exchange User Interface also uses Google Analytics technology to
   monitor traffic on the UI. All such information submitted is held by
   Index Exchange in strict confidence and as prescribed by corresponding
   regulatory authorities.

   Index Exchange does not engage in any form of distribution or sale of
   PII, PI or Personal Data to third parties for their own promotional
   use. Index Exchange does not sell, supply, or otherwise make user PII,
   PI or Personal Data available to any third party under any
   circumstances, unless ordered to do so by a court of competent
   jurisdiction.

   Information Obtained from Third Parties

   Index Exchange may obtain data from third party companies for the
   purpose of informing ad selection. This data may include Personal Data
   as defined under the GDPR. Advertisers who are clients of Index
   Exchange may collect PII and Personal Data on their own websites. These
   details are provided directly by the individual Internet user through
   online order forms, contests, etc. PII or Personal Data provided
   through an advertiser’s website is not visible to Index Exchange while
   being entered, nor provided to Index Exchange at any time in the
   future. This personal data collected by the advertiser is subject to
   the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved.

   YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

   Web Browser Option to Opt–Out

   Some of the ads you see on the internet or in applications on your
   mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity
   online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad
   tailoring — sometimes called “interest-based” advertising — is enabled
   through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile
   advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies.
   Tailored digital ads help support the free products, services and
   content you enjoy online. To help protect your privacy, Index Exchange
   (along with other NAI members) has voluntarily agreed to abide by high
   NAI standards including offering an opt-out mechanism.

   Opting out of interest-based advertising means that you will no longer
   be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests. It does not
   mean you will no longer see advertising online. When you opt-out, an
   opt-out cookie will be stored in your web browser signaling your
   opt-out preference to NAI members including Index Exchange.

   Please note that if your browser is configured to block third-party
   cookies, then the opt out cookie may not work. If you delete your
   browser cookies, you will need to opt out again. The opt-out will not
   apply to the specific browser in which you set it. The opt-out process
   must be repeated for each different browser.

   CLICK HERE TO OPT-OUT

   INDEX EXCHANGE INC. OFFERS INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE
   WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL’S PERSONAL DATA (OR SOMETIMES OTHERWISE REFERRED
   TO AS PERSONAL INFORMATION OR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) IS
   TO BE DISCLOSED TO A THIRD PARTY OR TO BE USED FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS
   MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PURPOSE(S) FOR WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY
   COLLECTED OR FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANY
   PURPOSE(S) SUBSEQUENTLY AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL.

   IN THE EVENT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXERCISE YOUR CHOICE (I.E. OPT-OUT)
   TO SPECIFY THAT INDEX EXCHANGE INC. MAY NOT DISCLOSE YOUR COOKIE DATA
   TO A THIRD PARTY, PLEASE VISIT THE NAI’S OPT-OUT PAGE BY FOLLOWING THE

   REFERRED TO AS PERSONAL INFORMATION OR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
   INFORMATION) FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

   AUTHORIZED, INDEX EXCHANGE INC. WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT
   OUT OF SUCH USES AND/OR DISCLOSURES.

   DATA RETENTION

   Index Exchange may retain data for as long as needed to provide
   services. We may retain data even after an account has been closed or
   is no longer engaged in business with Index Exchange if retention is
   reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations or meet
   regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or
   enforce our Privacy Policy or our contractual obligations. We also
   retain personal data for as long as is necessary to provide
   support-related reporting and trend analysis which is thirteen (13)
   months. After 13 months, we de-personalize data by creating data sets
   that cannot be traced back to individuals. Personal data will be
   destroyed according to our data destruction process.

   INFORMATION SECURITY

   Index Exchange follows strict Information Security policies to protect
   personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
   receive it. Although we take steps to secure your information, no
   method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
   storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
   acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its
   absolute security.

   In the unlikely event of a confirmed security breach, Index Exchange
   will investigate and contact impacted persons within 72 hours of the
   breach.

   We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law,
   in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court
   order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other
   government agency; when we believe that disclosure is necessary to
   protect or exercise our legal rights; or to defend against legal
   claims.

   EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS RESIDENTS

   Index Exchange transfers data from the European Union and Switzerland
   to the United States in accordance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy
   Shield Frameworks. More information on the Privacy Shield program set
   forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce can be found
   at https://www.privacyshield.gov/eu-us-framework.

   Index Exchange is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
   of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for any violations of the EU-US or
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Index Exchange may be held
   responsible if third party controllers to whom it transfers personal
   information or third party agents it engages to process this data on
   its behalf, act in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield
   Principles. Index Exchange is required to disclose personal information
   in response to lawful requests to meet national security or law
   enforcement requirements.

   Individuals residing in the European Union or Switzerland have the
   right to access any of their Personal Data retained by us. You also

Who We Are

   Advertising + technology. These worlds are complicated. Index Exchange
   was built to make things simple. We’re a global advertising marketplace
   where premium digital media companies transact ad impressions with
   accountability and in real-time.

   We’re independent, with no other business interests, which is why the
   top companies in the advertising, marketing and tech industries choose
   to partner with us. Built on the pillars of neutrality, openness, and
   the most reliable technology, we’re the ad exchange that media
   companies can trust.

The Index Difference

     * No Stranger
       to Disruption
       An evolution of online media and technology pioneer, Casale Media,
       we were founded to address a market need for a fully transparent
       exchange.
     * Independent
       by Choice
       We’re privately-held which allows us to make decisions for the
       long-term benefit of our clients, not the immediate demands of
       investors, or for short term profits.

For Publishers

   Every product built at Index Exchange has been created with our media
   partners in mind. Focusing on the needs of publishers, we’ve created a
   singularly focused, neutral, transparent ad exchange that puts
   publishers fully in control of their page and pricing. With white glove
   service from implementation to optimization, our customers are our
   obsession, and their success is our highest priority.

Key Benefits

     * Massive Demand
       Wide reaching, curated collection of buyers from the largest DSPs
       to the top Agency Trading Desks.
     * Accessible
       Our team of skilled engineers will do the heavy lifting of
       integration and maintenance to ensure success.
     * Advanced Technology
       The most cutting edge technology built with publishers in mind.
       That means robust infrastructure, and the most reliable, low
       latency technology.
     * Safe
       Every ad is individually screened to ensure it meets the highest
       standards of quality.

   "Index Exchange's transparency and neutrality are exceptional, and they
   have some of the best account management, tech and programmatic support
   in the business."
   Ilya Utkin, Director, Revenue Platforms and Operations at New York

For Buyers

   An ad exchange should never come between buyers and sellers. Index
   Exchange creates a fast and frictionless bridge for transacting deals
   in real time that enhances the relationship between the two. Strategic
   buyers are integral to a competitive marketplace. We believe our valued
   demand partners are best served by an independent ad exchange with no
   competing buy side business.

Key Benefits

     * Transparent
       Index Exchange never levies harmful hidden buy side fees that
       reduce working media.
     * Neutral
       Index Exchange has no buy side business to compete with our
       valuable demand partners. Our sole focus is building strong and
       fast pipes to facilitate transactions.
     * Flexible
       New ad technology moves lightning fast for buyers, and we know that
       moving fast to support new sizes and formats is critical to our
       mutual success.
     * Quality
       Every URL is individually screened to ensure it adheres to the
       highest quality standards.

   "Index Exchange provides premium supply with no buy side fees,
   recommending and monitoring our deals to ensure they remain competitive
   with the open market."
   Geoffrey Litwer, Media Director at Publicis Health Media

Life @ Index

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/304900715?app_id=122963

   Step foot into any of Index Exchange’s offices around the globe, and
   you’ll be walking into a diverse group of industry experts, pioneers
   and up-and-comers who are deeply energized by our company’s vision.

   While it may be trite, it’s true — the culture at Index Exchange is
   like that of a family. As a group of people dedicated to doing business
   honestly and transparently, colleagues feel connected and supported as
   they work towards both a common business goal and personal life
   achievements.

   Our offices and organization support a communal environment where
   colleagues can feel comfortable collaborating with a variety of teams,
   experience levels and backgrounds. Each member of the Index team is
   expected to take ownership and contribute from day one, as our business
   and industry is too-fast moving for red tape or bureaucracy. We’re
   always open to new ideas – whether focused on specific partners, teams
   or the company as a whole.
