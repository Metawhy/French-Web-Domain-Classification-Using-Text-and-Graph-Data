A new study suggests that Google collects more consumer data than users think
(way more)

   By Garett Sloane. Published on August 21, 2018.

   Google sucks up consumer data in ways users might find surprising—such
   as when browsers are in "incognito" mode—according to an analysis of
   the company's data collection by a researcher from Vanderbilt
   University.

   The study, released Tuesday and commissioned by the trade org Digital
   Content Next, looks at how data is gathered from all Google products,
   including Android mobile devices, Chrome web browsers, YouTube and
   Photos. In addition to incognito data collection, the study looked at
   other "passive" means of collection, where "an application is
   instrumented to gather information while it's running, possibly without
   the user's knowledge," the report says.

   Many users assume that when they're in the incognito setting, their
   online footprints are hidden. But Google could retroactively link the
   private browsing to specific consumers, the report points out.

   As the reports puts it: "While such data is collected with
   user-anonymous identifiers, Google has the ability to connect this
   collected information with a user's personal credentials stored in
   their Google Account."

   Here's how it works: A person fires up a private browser session in
   Chrome. On websites that run ads from Google's online ad marketplace,
   anonymized cookies are dropped on the browsers associated with the
   user. If the same person logs into a Google service like Gmail or
   YouTube, the act of signing into Google makes it possible to connect
   the earlier web activity to the now identified user. (Unless, that is,
   the cookies expired or were manually deleted by the user.)

   "That's not well understood by consumers," says Douglas Schmidt, author
   of the study and professor of computer science professor at Vanderbilt
   University. "But if you read the fine print on 'incognito' mode it
   brings up a whole lot of disclaimers."

   The study could not tell if Google takes the steps necessary to link
   the anonymous data from private browsing to the de-anonymized data when
   the person logs into its services.

   "Google collects all the information necessary to make that
   connection," Schmidt says. "It would give them a relative advantage to
   anyone else who can't do that correlation."

   "If a user is 'incognito' they think they're being as private as
   possible, and they're not realizing they gave that all up because they
   logged in," says Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group
   known for its opposition to the major internet companies' online
   dominance. "It's reasonable to think the average user does not expect
   that to be happening."

   According to an email from a Google spokeswoman, the company does not
   "join signed-out activity with your Google account information. We do
   not associate incognito browsing with accounts you may log into after
   you've exited your Incognito session. And our ads systems have no
   special knowledge of when Chrome is in incognito mode, or any other
   browser in a similar mode (ex: Safari Private Browsing, Firefox Private
   Browsing). We simply set and read cookies as allowed by the browser."

   The Google spokeswoman says the company takes issue with the report in
   general, citing the fact that Schmidt, the Vanderbilt University
   professor, once was used as an expert witness on behalf of Oracle in a
   case against Google, and Digital Content Next's involvement.

   "This report is commissioned by a professional DC lobbyist group, and
   written by a witness for Oracle in their ongoing copyright litigation
   with Google," the spokeswoman said in an e-mail statement. "So, it's no
   surprise that it contains wildly misleading information."

   Location, location, location

   The study also says that Google gets a sense of a person's location
   every time they log into WiFi or their phone pings a cell tower and
   that this, in turn, can even help it figure out a person's mode of
   transportation.

   "Google can ascertain with a high degree of confidence whether a user
   is still, walking, running, bicycling, or riding on a train or a car,"
   the report says. "It achieves this by tracking an Android mobile user's
   location coordinates at frequent time intervals in combination with the
   data from onboard sensors [such as an accelerometer] on mobile phones."

   Google Photos is another vast reservoir of data thanks to image
   recognition, according to the report. By default, Google analyzes
   photos and detects landmarks, logos, animals and other features, and it
   even registers the emotional state of people's faces.

   "Google's face detection capabilities even enable the detection of
   emotional states associated with faces in photos," the report says.

   The report was particularly concerned with the amount of passive data
   collected by Google, including information gotten through ads and
   third-party web and app activity not directly owned by Google. The
   report claims two-thirds of data collected by Google would be
   considered "passive."

   "While such information is typically collected without identifying a
   unique user," the report says, "Google distinctively possesses the
   ability to utilize data collected from other sources to de-anonymize
   such a collection."

   The study comes just as lawmakers in Washington consider more stringent
   privacy regulations. The EU already enacted its stricter General Data
   Protection Regulation in May, and Facebook and Google are facing
   similar pressure in the U.S. to account for how they track consumers
   online.

   In April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress about
   Cambridge Analytica, the third-party data firm that was accused of
   misusing data on 87 million Facebook users to unduly influence
   elections in the U.S. and U.K.

   A major concern of some U.S. lawmakers during those hearings focused on
   how Facebook tracks consumers that don't even use its services by
   gathering data through third-party websites with Facebook "like" and
   "share" buttons.

   The Vanderbilt report raises similar questions about Google. There are
   15 million websites using Google's ad services and 30 million use
   Google Analytics, which is the platform that lets them track traffic
   and other site performance metrics. Also, Chrome accounts for 60
   percent of all web browsing with a billion monthly users, the report
   says.

   An Associated Press report just last week showed how the company can
   record people's locations even when they turn off location tracking in
   their settings. Google is still able to log a person's location through
   its phones and other devices when a person fires up Google Maps or
   searches weather, the AP reported.

   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized how the
   study describes the potential for data collecting from people browsing
   the internet in "incognito" mode. According to the study, Google could
   potentially tie data gathered while in " incognito" mode to the user if
   that user logs into a Google service before exiting the private
   browsing session. Exiting an "incognito" session before logging into a
   Google service would delete any data associated with that session.

A new study suggests that Google collects more consumer data than users think
(way more)

   By Garett Sloane. Published on August 21, 2018.

   Google sucks up consumer data in ways users might find surprising—such
   as when browsers are in "incognito" mode—according to an analysis of
   the company's data collection by a researcher from Vanderbilt
   University.

   The study, released Tuesday and commissioned by the trade org Digital
   Content Next, looks at how data is gathered from all Google products,
   including Android mobile devices, Chrome web browsers, YouTube and
   Photos. In addition to incognito data collection, the study looked at
   other "passive" means of collection, where "an application is
   instrumented to gather information while it's running, possibly without
   the user's knowledge," the report says.

   Many users assume that when they're in the incognito setting, their
   online footprints are hidden. But Google could retroactively link the
   private browsing to specific consumers, the report points out.

   As the reports puts it: "While such data is collected with
   user-anonymous identifiers, Google has the ability to connect this
   collected information with a user's personal credentials stored in
   their Google Account."

   Here's how it works: A person fires up a private browser session in
   Chrome. On websites that run ads from Google's online ad marketplace,
   anonymized cookies are dropped on the browsers associated with the
   user. If the same person logs into a Google service like Gmail or
   YouTube, the act of signing into Google makes it possible to connect
   the earlier web activity to the now identified user. (Unless, that is,
   the cookies expired or were manually deleted by the user.)

   "That's not well understood by consumers," says Douglas Schmidt, author
   of the study and professor of computer science professor at Vanderbilt
   University. "But if you read the fine print on 'incognito' mode it
   brings up a whole lot of disclaimers."

   The study could not tell if Google takes the steps necessary to link
   the anonymous data from private browsing to the de-anonymized data when
   the person logs into its services.

   "Google collects all the information necessary to make that
   connection," Schmidt says. "It would give them a relative advantage to
   anyone else who can't do that correlation."

   "If a user is 'incognito' they think they're being as private as
   possible, and they're not realizing they gave that all up because they
   logged in," says Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group
   known for its opposition to the major internet companies' online
   dominance. "It's reasonable to think the average user does not expect
   that to be happening."

   According to an email from a Google spokeswoman, the company does not
   "join signed-out activity with your Google account information. We do
   not associate incognito browsing with accounts you may log into after
   you've exited your Incognito session. And our ads systems have no
   special knowledge of when Chrome is in incognito mode, or any other
   browser in a similar mode (ex: Safari Private Browsing, Firefox Private
   Browsing). We simply set and read cookies as allowed by the browser."

   The Google spokeswoman says the company takes issue with the report in
   general, citing the fact that Schmidt, the Vanderbilt University
   professor, once was used as an expert witness on behalf of Oracle in a
   case against Google, and Digital Content Next's involvement.

   "This report is commissioned by a professional DC lobbyist group, and
   written by a witness for Oracle in their ongoing copyright litigation
   with Google," the spokeswoman said in an e-mail statement. "So, it's no
   surprise that it contains wildly misleading information."

   Location, location, location

   The study also says that Google gets a sense of a person's location
   every time they log into WiFi or their phone pings a cell tower and
   that this, in turn, can even help it figure out a person's mode of
   transportation.

   "Google can ascertain with a high degree of confidence whether a user
   is still, walking, running, bicycling, or riding on a train or a car,"
   the report says. "It achieves this by tracking an Android mobile user's
   location coordinates at frequent time intervals in combination with the
   data from onboard sensors [such as an accelerometer] on mobile phones."

   Google Photos is another vast reservoir of data thanks to image
   recognition, according to the report. By default, Google analyzes
   photos and detects landmarks, logos, animals and other features, and it
   even registers the emotional state of people's faces.

   "Google's face detection capabilities even enable the detection of
   emotional states associated with faces in photos," the report says.

   The report was particularly concerned with the amount of passive data
   collected by Google, including information gotten through ads and
   third-party web and app activity not directly owned by Google. The
   report claims two-thirds of data collected by Google would be
   considered "passive."

   "While such information is typically collected without identifying a
   unique user," the report says, "Google distinctively possesses the
   ability to utilize data collected from other sources to de-anonymize
   such a collection."

   The study comes just as lawmakers in Washington consider more stringent
   privacy regulations. The EU already enacted its stricter General Data
   Protection Regulation in May, and Facebook and Google are facing
   similar pressure in the U.S. to account for how they track consumers
   online.

   In April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress about
   Cambridge Analytica, the third-party data firm that was accused of
   misusing data on 87 million Facebook users to unduly influence
   elections in the U.S. and U.K.

   A major concern of some U.S. lawmakers during those hearings focused on
   how Facebook tracks consumers that don't even use its services by
   gathering data through third-party websites with Facebook "like" and
   "share" buttons.

   The Vanderbilt report raises similar questions about Google. There are
   15 million websites using Google's ad services and 30 million use
   Google Analytics, which is the platform that lets them track traffic
   and other site performance metrics. Also, Chrome accounts for 60
   percent of all web browsing with a billion monthly users, the report
   says.

   An Associated Press report just last week showed how the company can
   record people's locations even when they turn off location tracking in
   their settings. Google is still able to log a person's location through
   its phones and other devices when a person fires up Google Maps or
   searches weather, the AP reported.

   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized how the
   study describes the potential for data collecting from people browsing
   the internet in "incognito" mode. According to the study, Google could
   potentially tie data gathered while in " incognito" mode to the user if
   that user logs into a Google service before exiting the private
   browsing session. Exiting an "incognito" session before logging into a
   Google service would delete any data associated with that session.
