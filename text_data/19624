     So I’ve seen scams about this floating around Facebook but this is
     the first one I’ve seen on Tumblr. I love the fidget cube and it is
     amazing - but the only real one that isn’t a bad reproduced knockoff
     or a straight up scam is from Antsy Labs. Antsy Labs is the company
     that originally kickstarted this project.

     DON’T BELIEVE ANY OF THE OTHER ADS FLOATING AROUND THEY ARE
     LITERALLY USING ANTSY LABS IMAGES.

     Basically you’re either going to get a really crappy version of one,
     IF you get one at all. There are some that are just taking people’s
     money and running.

     When I first saw this website I checked it out and they didn’t even
     have a contact us section and their “return policy” looks sketchy as
     hell.

     Don’t lose your money on this! If you want a real one go check out
     @antsylabs!

     SIGNAL BOOST! I just got my real one in the mail, and having played
     with a real one and a knock-off, there is no contest… get the real
     deal! Support antsy labs and the work they put into inventing and
     perfecting this thing.

     Absolutely agreed. The antsy labs ones are nice. Everyone I’ve
     talked to with knockoffs has been disappointed.

     It turns out, in this case, you really do get what you pay for. The
     more expensive plastic, quality control, and so on all cost money…
     But the resulting gizmo is really nice.

We’re still here

   Hey guys! So uh. I haven’t touched this blog in… awhile. Last year and
   until February this year, I was living overseas as a student in Japan.
   As you can imagine, I was very busy and didn’t have time to focus on
   this blog. Now that I’m back in Australia and a bit more chilled out,
   I’ll try to be more active on this blog, and try to post at least once
   a week.

   I’m sorry to everyone that’s sent us messages over the last year. I
   have not been intentionally ignoring you, I have just not had the
   spoons to work on Sensory People.

   Here’s to a new year, and a new year of Sensory People! Thank you all
   for your patience.

   - Liese

TUMBLR SLIMERS! A safety advisory!

   slimecentral:

     Recently, Health Canada is advising Canadians to avoid using borax
     to make kids’ arts and crafts, such as homemade “slime,” over
     concerns that too much exposure to boric acid can cause
     “developmental and reproductive health effects” in children and
     pregnant women. Borax is a salt of boric acid, a naturally occurring
     mineral, and often sold as a “laundry booster.” Most of these
     products warn that borax can be an eye and skin irritant and should
     never be ingested. Because it is highly alkaline and can dissolve
     oils and fats, borax is also an effective household cleaner, and
     seen by some – including the David Suzuki Foundation –as more
     eco-friendly than petroleum-based cleaning products. Health Canada
     advises Canadians to avoid homemade craft and pesticide recipes
     using boric acid.

     So… what does this mean? I’m not sure about other countries, but the
     agency of health in Canada has deemed borax unsafe, and recommends
     that it should not be used for children’s arts and crafts,
     especially including slime.

     CRAP I’VE USED THIS STUFF CRAP CRAP WILL I DIE? No, you won’t. This
     is just an advisory, and it’s prolonged exposure that isn’t healthy
     for kids or expecting women. Just don’t use it from now on.

     Well, how else will I make my slime? There are so many other liquid
     starch based and plasticine based recipes out there that work just
     as well, if not better! I’ll make a masterpost of some soon.

     BE CAREFUL FRIENDS, SLIME SAFE, AND SLIME HAPPY!

     ******Even if you aren’t an avid tumblr slimer or slime account,
     boosting this would be much appreciated!

     my squishy peach from banggood arrived today! i purchased this
     squishy toy for myself because it looked so cute on the site. it’s
     so soft, squishes all the way down and is really slow rising which
     is satisfying to watch. the peach comes in three different colours,
     however you cant choose the colour yourself but theyre all very cute
     so it doesn’t matter at all.

     if you want to get one for yourself, this peach is only $1.99 for 4
     more days!

     just an fyi if you start randomly hearing sounds like a chain saw,
     beating heart or screams, its your chat function because tumblr
     randomly changed the sounds without any warning.

     Update:
     image

     you can turn it off by opening any chat window, clicking the three
     dots, and clicking “Make the spooky sounds stop.” This should
     restore the normal notification sounds.

     It will then look like this:

ida-adora-deactivated20180613 asked: I'm always in constant pain and stress
due to SPD and executive dysfunction and i cant continue. I try minimise
being overwhelmed but its impossible. The only thing that helps now is being
in bed all day. Its really bad cuz I live alone and have

     Responsibilities and bills to pay. I want to take meds for it but I
     dunno what will be best? I cant focus on anything I’m just always in
     pain. Can I get it from the GP or do i have to see a specialist?
     Thanks xx

   Hey there. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of stressful
   stuff!

   There is no medication that you can take for SPD. However, I would
   definitely recommend talking to a doctor about what is happening. It
   may be SPD, or there could be another health issue that’s causing these
   symptoms or exacerbating your SPD. You’ll wanna get it checked out by a
   professional, in any case.

   It may also be good to see what disability supports there are in your
   area. For example, having someone come to your house and help you out
   with cooking, cleaning, taking you out to the supermarket, helping you
   navigate paying your bills, etc. You’ll have to do a bit of research to
   find what’s around and how to access them.

   In terms of coping with SPD, an Occupational Therapist that specialises
   in sensory processing should be able to help you work out ways to help
   regulate your sensory system. They may also be able to assist you with
   daily living skills to help you get back on your feet.

   If anyone else has any other suggestions or advice, please feel free to
   add it!

   I hope that is helpful, and I wish you luck! I hope you feel better
   soon.

   Liesel, Mod.

How to tell if a video is a screamer

   aph-belgium:

     halloween is fast approaching, and sending screamers has become an
     increasingly popular trend over the past few years. while some
     people may enjoy them, they can also trigger anxiety attacks in
     others.
     * check the section/category of a video. if it’s
       under “comedy”, “prank”, “horror”, or something similar, close the
       tab immediately.
     * comments are also a giveaway. scroll to the comments section before
       playing a video. if comments are disabled, there’s a likely chance
       the video is a screamer. close the tab right away. if you see
       comments like “whoa, that made me jump!”, close the window! and if
       it’s impossible to disable comments, look for multiple comments
       deleted by the creator.
     * check out the video itself, while it’s paused. if it has very low
       music (this makes the audience want to turn the volume up, so the
       scream is louder and scarier), or if it has very small text (which
       makes you want to go into full screen), that’s a good indication
       that it’s a screamer. exit out and close the tab!
     * look at the content of the video. if the clip itself deals with the
       scary or supernatural, like a film about ghosts, you can’t be
       certain. be careful, and exit the tab if the content seems
       triggering. pause the video and forward all the way to the end. If
       everything is good feel free to watch. if a frame with a scary
       picture comes up, close the tab immediately.
     * if the video shows a room or picture, and invites you to “find
       what’s wrong in the picture”, or “find _____”, close the window
       immediately!
     * there’s a new trend going on where videos describing people
       reacting to screamers are actually screamers themselves. if you
       suspect this, scroll down and see the comments. if the maker of the
       video disabled comments to purposely lead viewers to believe the
       video is genuine, scroll down just enough to see the video time, so
       you don’t see the video itself. Turn the volume down, just in case
       it is a screamer, and if the video plays out and there’s no scream,
       it’s safe to watch.
     * check the time on the video. if it’s suspiciously short, exit the
       tab.
     * look at the related or recommended videos. if any of them fit the
       above, the video is a screamer.

     stay safe this halloween season!

imhongwherethesunalwaysshines asked: So I'm really confused because there are
a few really specific things that cause me to have something that seem like
sensory overload but I don't know if I'm actually having sensory overload
since the things that cause them are really specific

   Hi there!

   Well, I’m not in a position to give you an answer as to whether or not
   you’re experiencing sensory overload. But sensory triggers can
   absolutely be specific things. I know of an autistic woman who’s
   triggered by a specific ingredient used in perfumes. People can be
   triggered by specific scents like that, specific textures, specific
   sounds, sights, etc.

   So it’s very possible that the things that trigger you are hitting your
   sensory system in just the wrong way.

   If you want more concrete answers, I would recommend seeking out an
   Occupational Therapist who specialises in SPD. They may also be able to
   help you work out ways to regulate yourself when those triggers come
   up.

   I hope that helps!

   Liesel, Mod.

Signal Boost

     SHOPCA5EY on ETSY

     Hello! We are a transgender couple who desperately need help paying
     for our rent, food and medical bills. My girlfriend is having a hard
     time finding someone who will hire her and I am a multiply-disabled
     autistic who is mentally ill and a wheelchair user and cannot work.
     My medical bills are outstanding and overdue and while my girlfriend
     has a degree in computer engineering, work is scarce and she has
     student debt.

     We are not looking for donations, but we ask that you could please
     signal boost this post to draw attention to our products. We make
     stuffed animals, fidget toys and jewelry to sell on Etsy. We have
     been doing well with disabled and autistic Tumblr, and as much as I
     love my community, I need to branch out and find more customers,
     preferably some who have more “disposable” income.

     I feel like our products could appeal to lots of people if we could
     just get the word out, and it would be a big help! Unless I start
     making $700 more per month on Etsy, our savings will be gone and we
     will be homeless in January.

     We do take custom orders if you want to commission a plush toy or
     ask us to resize some jewelry for you, in case one of our 85+
     listings don’t catch your eye.

     Again we are SHOPCA5EY on ETSY and we would appreciate a quick
     reblog if you are able! We are in a really tough spot right now.
     Hugs to all of you!

     -Casey
