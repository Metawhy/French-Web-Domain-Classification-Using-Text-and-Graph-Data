Overview

   The aim of the AVoCS workshop series is to contribute to the
   interaction and exchange of ideas among members of the international
   research community on tools and techniques for the verification of
   critical systems. In particular, AVoCS 2018 aims to bring together
   scientists and engineers that are active in the area of formal methods,
   develop tools and techniques for the automated verification of critical
   systems, and are interested in exchanging their experiences in the
   industrial usage of these methods and tools.
   AVOCS 2018 is an affiliated workshop of FLoC 2018
