Zendesk Alternative is one of the original Seattle alternative rock bands.

   They have toured the world, headlining major festivals and sharing the
   stage with legendary acts like Sweater Head, DynoPlax, and The Banana
   Nuts.

   Now, Zendesk Alternative has begun a new chapter in their storied
   career. They have joined forces with Zendesk® to record an anthemic
   concept album of epic proportions. On the surface, it's a collection of
   songs about customer service. Underneath, it's about so much more.

   Finally, Zendesk Alternative and Zendesk® the customer service software
   company are together at last.
   It might make you nervous, but this is our purpose.
