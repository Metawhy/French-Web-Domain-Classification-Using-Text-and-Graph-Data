   Warning: Electrum versions older than 3.3.4 are susceptible to
   phishing. Do not download Electrum from another source than
   electrum.org, and learn to verify GPG signatures.

Safe

   Your private keys are encrypted and never leave your computer.

Forgiving

   Your funds can be recovered from a secret phrase.

Instant On

   Electrum is fast, because it uses servers that index the Bitcoin
   blockchain.

No Lock-In

   You can export your private keys and use them in other Bitcoin clients.

No Downtimes

   Electrum servers are decentralized and redundant. Your wallet is never
   down.

Proof Checking

   Electrum Wallet verifies all the transactions in your history using
   SPV.

Cold Storage

   Keep your private keys offline, and go online with a watching-only
   wallet.

Multisig

   Split the permission to spend your coins between several wallets.

Add-ons

   Electrum supports third-party plugins: Multisig services, Hardware
   wallets, etc.
