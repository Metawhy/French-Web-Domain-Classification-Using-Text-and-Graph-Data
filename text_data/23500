Présentation

   DELYS est une équipe de recherche commune entre Inria Paris, le CNRS et
   Sorbonne Université au sein du Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris
   6, LIP6 (UMR 7606).

Présentation de l’équipe

   DELYS étudie les nouveaux systèmes distribués d’un point de vue
   pratique et théorique. Sa recherche s’intéresse à un large spectre de
   systèmes répartis : le cloud et « Fog » computing, les réseaux mobiles,
   les systèmes dynamiques tels que les réseaux de robots, les
   multi-coeurs…

   Ces nouveaux systèmes informatiques distribués doivent tolérer les
   fautes, supporter la dynamique des noeuds et leur hétérogénéité,  gérer
   une virtualisation à plusieurs niveaux. Les algorithmes conçus pour les
   systèmes distribués statiques doivent être donc être repensés pour
   tenir compte de la nature hautement instable du système.

Thèmes de recherche

   DELYS concentre ses recherches autour de trois défis :
    1. Repenser les algorithmes distribués. D’un point de vue théorique,
       la question clé est de savoir comment adapter les algorithmes
       fondamentaux aux nouvelles architectures dynamiques. Les objectifs
       de DELYS sont  (1) d’identifier sous quelles hypothèses réalistes
       un problème fondamental donné, tel que l’exclusion mutuelle, le
       consensus ou encore l’élection de leader, peut être résolu et (2)
       de concevoir des algorithmes efficaces en fonction de ces
       hypothèses.
    2. La gestion des ressources dans des grandes systèmes hétérogènes. La
       gestion des ressources dans ces systèmes nécessite des solutions
       entièrement décentralisées. Dans ce contexte, la gestion des
       données est un élément clé. Le problème fondamental abordé dans
       DELYS est de savoir comment partager des informations de manière
       efficace et fiable dans des environnements hautement distribués.
    3. L’adaptation des supports d’exécution. Avec l’utilisation de plus
       en plus répandue des architectures multicœurs et des environnements
       virtualisés, les protocoles des supports d’exécution doivent être
       revisités. Notre recherche vise  à fournir des solutions permettant
       de partager efficacement des ressources telles que la mémoire entre
       des environnements virtualisés sans compromettre les propriétés
       d’isolation.

Presentation

   OURAGAN focus on the transfer of computational algebraic methods to
   some related fields (computational geometry, topology, number theory,
   etc.) and some carefully chosen application domains (robotics, control
   theory, evaluation of the security of cryptographic systems, etc.).

   We are working equally on the use (modeling, know – how) and on the
   development of new algorithms.

   An original aspect of the OURAGAN is to blend into an environment of
   fundamental mathematics, at the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu —
   Paris Rive Gauche (IMJ-PRG CNRS 7586), and to be cross-functional to
   several teams (Algebraic Analysis, Complex Analysis and Geometry,
   Number Theory to name only the main ones).
     __________________________________________________________________

   OURAGAN works on three general directions with five particular targets:
     * Algebraic analysis of functional systems
     * Number Theory
          + Algorithmic Number Theory
          + Rigorous Numerical Computations
     * Topology in small dimension
          + Character varieties
          + Knot theory
          + Computational geometry

   These actions come, of course, in addition to the study and development
   of a common set of core elements of
     * Basic theory and algorithms in algebra and geometry

   The tools and objects developed for research on algorithmic number
   theory as well as on topology in small dimension apply quite directly
   on some selected connected challenging subjects:
     * Security of cryptographic systems
     * Control theory
     * Signal processing
     * Robotics

Presentation

   KerData is a joint research team of Inria Rennes – Bretagne Atlantique,
    ENS Rennes and INSA Rennes and a team of the IRISA lab.

   Leader: Gabriel Antoniu, Research Director at Inria

   Our research activities address the area of distributed data management
   at challenging scales, with a particular focus on clouds and
   postpetascale HPC architectures. We address the requirements of
   data-oriented high-performance applications that exhibit the need to
   handle massive non structured data – BLOBs: binary large objects (on
   the order of terabytes) – stored in a large number (thousands to tens
   of thousands), accessed under heavy concurrency by a large number of
   clients (thousands to tens of thousands at a time) with a relatively
   fine access grain (on the order of megabytes). Examples of such
   applications are:
     * Extreme-scale HPC simulations generating massive amounts of data
     * Cloud data analysis applications (e.g., based on the MapReduce
       paradigm) handling massive data, potentially geo- distributed at a
       large scale
     * Applications with high requirements in terms of real-time stream
       processing

   Our approach strongly relies on experimentation on the Grid’5000
   platform, on top supercomputers and on reference cloud platforms.

Project-team Cairn

Energy Efficient Computing ArchItectures with Embedded Reconfigurable
Resources

   Common project-team with INRIA Rennes – Bretagne Atlantique, CNRS, ENS
   Rennes, University of Rennes 1

   Cairn is located on two campuses: Rennes and Lannion    project_logo

   Abstract: The Cairn project-team researches new architectures,
   algorithms and design methods for flexible and energy efficiency
   domain-specific system-on-chip (SoC). As performance and
   energy-efficiency requirements of SoCs are continuously increasing,
   they become difficult to fulfil using only programmable processors
   solutions. To address this issue, we promote/advocate the use of
   reconfigurable hardware, i.e. hardware structures whose organization
   may change before or even during execution. Such reconfig- urable SoCs
   offer high performance at a low energy cost, while preserving a high
   level of flexibility. The group studies these SoCs from three angles:
   (i) The invention and design of new reconfigurable platforms with an
   emphasis on flexible arithmetic operator design, dynamic
   reconfiguration management and low- power consumption. (ii) The
   development of their corresponding design flows (compilation and
   synthesis tools) to enable their automatic design from high-level
   specifications. (iii) The interaction between algo- rithms and
   architectures especially for our main application domains (wireless
   communications, wireless sensor networks and digital security). The
   team has been created on January the 1st, 2008 and is
   a “reconfiguration” of the former R2D2 research team from Irisa.

   CairnFlow

   The development of complex applications is traditionally split in three
   stages: a theoretical study of the algorithms, an analysis of the
   target architecture and the implementation. When facing new emerging
   applications such as high-performance, low-power and low-cost mobile
   communication systems or smart sensor-based systems, it is mandatory to
   strengthen the design flow by a joint study of both algorithmic and
   architectural issues. The figure below shows the global design flow
   that we propose to develop. This flow is organized in levels which
   refer to our three research themes: application optimization (new
   algorithms, fixed-point arithmetic and advanced representations of
   numbers), architecture optimization (reconfigurable and specialized
   hardware, application-specific processors), and stepwise refinement and
   code generation (code transformations, hardware synthesis,
   compilation).

Presentation

   OURAGAN focus on the transfer of computational algebraic methods to
   some related fields (computational geometry, topology, number theory,
   etc.) and some carefully chosen application domains (robotics, control
   theory, evaluation of the security of cryptographic systems, etc.).

   We are working equally on the use (modeling, know – how) and on the
   development of new algorithms.

   An original aspect of the OURAGAN is to blend into an environment of
   fundamental mathematics, at the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu —
   Paris Rive Gauche (IMJ-PRG CNRS 7586), and to be cross-functional to
   several teams (Algebraic Analysis, Complex Analysis and Geometry,
   Number Theory to name only the main ones).
     __________________________________________________________________

   OURAGAN works on three general directions with five particular targets:
     * Algebraic analysis of functional systems
     * Number Theory
          + Algorithmic Number Theory
          + Rigorous Numerical Computations
     * Topology in small dimension
          + Character varieties
          + Knot theory
          + Computational geometry

   These actions come, of course, in addition to the study and development
   of a common set of core elements of
     * Basic theory and algorithms in algebra and geometry

   The tools and objects developed for research on algorithmic number
   theory as well as on topology in small dimension apply quite directly
   on some selected connected challenging subjects:
     * Security of cryptographic systems
     * Control theory
     * Signal processing
     * Robotics

   KerData is a joint research team of Inria Rennes – Bretagne Atlantique,
    ENS Rennes and INSA Rennes and a team of the IRISA lab.

   Leader: Gabriel Antoniu, Research Director at Inria

   Our research activities address the area of distributed data management
   at challenging scales, with a particular focus on clouds and
   postpetascale HPC architectures. We address the requirements of
   data-oriented high-performance applications that exhibit the need to
   handle massive non structured data – BLOBs: binary large objects (on
   the order of terabytes) – stored in a large number (thousands to tens
   of thousands), accessed under heavy concurrency by a large number of
   clients (thousands to tens of thousands at a time) with a relatively
   fine access grain (on the order of megabytes). Examples of such
   applications are:
     * Extreme-scale HPC simulations generating massive amounts of data
     * Cloud data analysis applications (e.g., based on the MapReduce
       paradigm) handling massive data, potentially geo- distributed at a
       large scale
     * Applications with high requirements in terms of real-time stream
       processing

   Our approach strongly relies on experimentation on the Grid’5000
   platform, on top supercomputers and on reference cloud platforms.

Project-team Cairn

Energy Efficient Computing ArchItectures with Embedded Reconfigurable
Resources

   Common project-team with INRIA Rennes – Bretagne Atlantique, CNRS, ENS
   Rennes, University of Rennes 1

   Cairn is located on two campuses: Rennes and Lannion    project_logo

   Abstract: The Cairn project-team researches new architectures,
   algorithms and design methods for flexible and energy efficiency
   domain-specific system-on-chip (SoC). As performance and
   energy-efficiency requirements of SoCs are continuously increasing,
   they become difficult to fulfil using only programmable processors
   solutions. To address this issue, we promote/advocate the use of
   reconfigurable hardware, i.e. hardware structures whose organization
   may change before or even during execution. Such reconfig- urable SoCs
   offer high performance at a low energy cost, while preserving a high
   level of flexibility. The group studies these SoCs from three angles:
   (i) The invention and design of new reconfigurable platforms with an
   emphasis on flexible arithmetic operator design, dynamic
   reconfiguration management and low- power consumption. (ii) The
   development of their corresponding design flows (compilation and
   synthesis tools) to enable their automatic design from high-level
   specifications. (iii) The interaction between algo- rithms and
   architectures especially for our main application domains (wireless
   communications, wireless sensor networks and digital security). The
   team has been created on January the 1st, 2008 and is
   a “reconfiguration” of the former R2D2 research team from Irisa.

   CairnFlow

   The development of complex applications is traditionally split in three
   stages: a theoretical study of the algorithms, an analysis of the
   target architecture and the implementation. When facing new emerging
   applications such as high-performance, low-power and low-cost mobile
   communication systems or smart sensor-based systems, it is mandatory to
   strengthen the design flow by a joint study of both algorithmic and
   architectural issues. The figure below shows the global design flow
   that we propose to develop. This flow is organized in levels which
   refer to our three research themes: application optimization (new
   algorithms, fixed-point arithmetic and advanced representations of
   numbers), architecture optimization (reconfigurable and specialized
   hardware, application-specific processors), and stepwise refinement and
   code generation (code transformations, hardware synthesis,
   compilation).

Project overview

   The overall goal of the Celtique project is to improve the security and
   reliability of software with semantics-based modeling, analysis and
   certification techniques. To achieve this goal, the project conducts
   work on improving semantic description and analysis techniques, as well
   as work on using proof assistants (most notably Coq) to develop and
   prove properties of these techniques. We are applying such techniques
   to a variety of source languages, including Java, C, and JavaScript. We
   also study how these techniques apply to low-level languages, and how
   they can be combined with certified compilation. The CompCert certified
   compiler and its intermediate representations are used for much of our
   work on semantic modeling and analysis of C and lower-level
   representations.

   The semantic analyses extract approximate but sound descriptions of
   software behaviour from which a proof of safety or security can be
   constructed. The analyses of interest include numerical data flow
   analysis, control flow analysis for higher-order languages, alias and
   points-to analysis for heap structure manipulation. In particular, we
   have designed several analyses for information flow control, aimed at
   computing attacker knowledge and detecting side channels.

   We work with three application domains: Java software for small devices
   (in particular smart cards and mobile telephones), embedded C programs,
   and web applications.

   Celtique is a joint project with the CNRS, the University of Rennes 1
   and ENS Rennes.

   The Rainbow team is a joint Inria/IRISA Project-Team in partnership
   with CNRS, Université de Rennes 1, and Insa of Rennes.

   The long-term vision of the Rainbow team is to develop the next
   generation of sensor-based robots able to navigate and/or interact in
   complex unstructured environments together with human users.

   We aim at tackling these general scientific challenges:
     * high-level of autonomy for complex robots in complex (unstructured)
       environments;
     * forward interfaces for letting an operator giving high-level
       commands to the robots in simple ways;
     * backward interfaces for informing the operator about the robot
       ‘status’;
     * user studies for assessing the best interfacing depending on the
       particular task/situation.

   The applications targeted by research activities involve:
     * remote manipulation with single/multiple arms under the guidance of
       a human operator
     * coordination of single/multiple mobile robots for spatial
       navigation tasks (e.g., exploration, navigation, mapping)
     * medical robotics for semi-autonomous probing and intervention
     * assistive mobility devices for frail or impaired people

   Empenn (means “Brain” in Breton language) ERL U1228 research team is
   jointly affiliated with Inria, Inserm (National Institute of Health and
   Scientific Research), CNRS (INS2I institute), and University of Rennes
   I. It is a team of IRISA/UMR CNRS 6074. Empenn is based in Rennes, at
   both the medical and science campuses. The team follows the “VisAGeS”
   one that was created for 12 years in 2006 by Inria, As for “VisAGeS”,
   Empenn hosts the accreditation number U1228 renewed by Inserm in 2017,
   after a competitive evaluation conducted by both HCERES and Inserm.

   Through this unique partnership, the ambition of Empenn is to establish
   a multidisciplinary team bringing together researchers in information
   sciences and medicine. Our medium- and long-term objective is to
   introduce our basic research to clinical practice, while maintaining
   the excellence of our methodological research.

   Our goal is to foster research in medical imaging, neuroinformatics and
   population cohorts. In particular, the Empenn team  targets the
   detection and development of imaging biomarkers for brain diseases and
   focus its efforts on translating this research to clinics and clinical
   neurosciences at large.

   In particular, the objective of Empenn is to propose new statistical
   and computing methods, and to measure and model brain morphological,
   structural and functional states in order to better diagnose, monitor
   and deliver treatment for mental, neurological and substance use
   disorders. We propose combining advanced instrumental devices and new
   computational models to provide advanced diagnosis, therapeutic and
   neuro-rehabilitation solutions for some of the major disorders of the
   developing and aging brain.

   Generic and challenging research topics in this broad domain include
   finding new ways to compare models and data, assist decisions and
   interpretation, and develop feedback from experiments. These activities
   are performed in close collaboration with the Neurinfo in vivo imaging
   platform, which is a critical environment for the experimental
   implementation of our research on challenging clinical research
   projects and the development of new clinical applications.

Research themes

   New practices in medicine bring new challenges in information sciences.
   This is acutely challenging for brain disorders,where the main
   challenges we facetoday include (1) improving the understanding of the
   brain (especially the brain in action), (2) undertaking more effective
   monitoring of therapeutic procedures, (3) modeling groups of normal and
   pathological individuals from signal and image descriptors, and (4)
   discovering new therapeutic and rehabilitation strategies for brain
   recovery. In addressing these challenges, current medicine lacks
   computational models able to align multimodal and multiscale
   observations ofpatients withunderlying pathological phenomena,as well
   as frameworks to validate these models in clinical settings. These
   issues pose new challenges in the field of digital sciences and require
   the development of new solutions for (1) mining descriptors from in
   vivo observations,(2) assimilating the large amount of data produced
   for each patient through compact and relevant mathematical
   representations, (3) learning the dynamics of spatiotemporal data to
   predict the course of the disease in individual patients, and (4)
   reconciling observations and treatment processes (the
   theragnostics concept).

   In this context, some of our major developments and newly arising
   issues and challenges include:
     * The generation of new descriptors to study brain structure and
       function (e.g. the combination of variations in brain perfusion
       with and without a contrast agent; changes in brain structure in
       relation to normal, pathological, functional or connectivity
       patterns; or the modeling of brain state during cognitive
       stimulation using neurofeedback).
     * The integration of additional spatiotemporal and hybrid imaging
       sequences covering a larger range of observations, from the
       molecular level to the organ one, via the cellular level (arterial
       spin labeling, diffusion MRI, MR relaxometry, MR fingerprinting, MR
       cell labeling imaging, MR-PET molecular imaging, EEG-MRI-NIRS
       functional imaging, etc.).
     * The creation of computational models through the data fusion of
       molecular, cellular (i.e. through dedicated ligands or
       nanocarriers), structural and functional image descriptors from
       group studies of normal and/or pathological subjects.
     * The evaluation of these models in relation to acute pathologies,
       especially for the study of degenerative, psychiatric, traumatic or
       developmental brain diseases (primarily multiple sclerosis, stroke,
       traumatic brain injury (TBI) and depression, but applicable with a
       potential additional impact to epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease,
       dementia, PTSD, …) within a translational framework.

   In terms of new major methodological challenges, we will address the
   development of models and algorithms to reconstruct, analyze and
   transform the images, and to manage the mass of data to store,
   distribute and “semanticize” (i.e. provide a logical division of the
   model’s components according to their meaning). As such, we expect to
   make methodological contributions in the fields of model inference;
   statistical analysis and modeling; the application of sparse
   representation (compressed sensing and dictionary learning) and machine
   learning (supervised/unsupervised classification and discrete model
   learning); data fusion (multimodal integration, registration, patch
   analysis, etc.); high-dimensional optimization; data integration; and
   brain-computer interfaces.

   In summary, we expect to address the following major challenges:
     * Developing new information processing methods able to detect
       imaging biomarkers in the context of mental, neurological, and
       substance use disorders.
     * Providing new computational solutions, allowing a more appropriate
       representation of data for image analysis and the detection of
       biomarkers specific to a form or grade of pathology, or specific to
       a population of subjects.
     * Providing new patient-adapted connectivity atlases for the study
       and characterization of diseases from quantitative MRI.
     * Providing new analytical models of dynamic regional perfusion, and
       deriving indices of dynamic brain local perfusion from normal and
       pathological populations.
     * Investigating whether the theragnostics paradigm of rehabilitation
       from hybrid neurofeedback can be effective in some behavioral and
       disability pathologies.

   These major advances are primarily developed and validated in the
   context of several priority applications: multiple sclerosis, stroke
   rehabilitation, and the study and treatment of depression

   In terms of scientific organization, our research project are organized
   around three major technological and basics cience topics (Population
   Imaging, Detection and Learning,and Quantitative Imaging) and three
   major translational axes (Behavior, Neuro-inflammationand Recovery)
   that are generic enough to address a large range of central nervous
   system diseases.

International and industrial relations

   Inria Associate Teams
     * MMINCARAV (Multimodal Microstructure-Informed Connectivity:
       Acquisition, Reconstruction, Analysis and Validation) Associate
       Team
          + The Multimodal Microstructure-Informed Connectivity:
            Acquisition, Reconstruction, Analysis and Validation
            (MMINCARAV) project is an associate team between Empenn (Inria
            Rennes Bretagne Atlantique) and LTS5 (École Polytechnique
            Fédérale de Lausanne — EPFL) started in 2019. The main
            objective of this associate team is to develop novel methods
            for the quantification of microstructure properties in brain
            tissues using diffusion MRI and relaxometry, in relation with
            the macrostructure organization of the brain connectome.
     * BARBANT (Boston and Rennes, Brain image Analysis)  associated team
          + In the period 2013 and 2017, this associated team is shared
            between INRIA Visages team and the Computational Radiology
            Laboratory of the Children’s hospital Boston at Harvard
            Medical School. It addresses the topic of better understanding
            the behavior and evolution of neurological pathologies (such
            as neurodevelopmental delay or multiple sclerosis) at the
            organ and local level, and the modeling of normal and
            pathological groups of individuals (cohorts) from image
            descriptors. After 6 years of official Inria associated team
            affiliation, BARBANT team will be transforms as an officila
            Inria Internationall partnership.
     * We also have a strong collaboration under the International
       Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) on the development of
       standards and tools for neuroimaging data sharing
