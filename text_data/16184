TRAVELLING TO A HOME GAME

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC)

   Sat Nav postcode: CH42 9PY

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Please be aware you may have to pay a toll depending on your route to
   the ground:

   The Mersey Gateway Bridge - the bridge operates a free flow tolling
   system. This means there are no toll booths on the bridge so traffic
   can move quickly across the route. Cameras and sensors read vehicle
   number plates and special Merseyflow stickers to charge drivers. Anyone
   who crosses the bridge and doesn’t pay by 11.59pm the day after will
   receive a penalty charge notice. For more details including toll
   charges and to pay a toll click here.

   Mersey Tunnel - payments are in cash at the tolling booths. For more
   details including toll charges please click here.

   our guide for everything you need to know about attending a home game.

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC).

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Match day experience:

   Seating at the stadium is unreserved so you can sit together with

   staff, news, player profiles, team stats and puzzles for kids.

   Refreshments can be purchased from the concourse area at the stadium.

   chocolate, sweets and pies.

   A selection of official LFC Women merchandise is available to buy
   within the stadium including home shirts, LFC Women scarves, player
   cards and more.

   Official club mascot Mighty Red attends all LFC Women home games,
   meeting and greeting supporters ahead of kick-off and providing half
   time entertainment, inviting a lucky fan onto the pitch to take part in
   a penalty shoot-out game and the opportunity to win exclusive prizes.

   If you need help on the day, ask any of the stewards located around the
   ground who will be happy to help!

TRAVELLING TO A HOME GAME

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC)

   Sat Nav postcode: CH42 9PY

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Please be aware you may have to pay a toll depending on your route to
   the ground:

   The Mersey Gateway Bridge - the bridge operates a free flow tolling
   system. This means there are no toll booths on the bridge so traffic
   can move quickly across the route. Cameras and sensors read vehicle
   number plates and special Merseyflow stickers to charge drivers. Anyone
   who crosses the bridge and doesn’t pay by 11.59pm the day after will
   receive a penalty charge notice. For more details including toll
   charges and to pay a toll click here.

   Mersey Tunnel - payments are in cash at the tolling booths. For more
   details including toll charges please click here.

   our guide for everything you need to know about attending a home game.

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Match day experience:

   Seating at the stadium is unreserved so you can sit together with

   staff, news, player profiles, team stats and puzzles for kids.

   Refreshments can be purchased from the concourse area at the stadium.

   chocolate, sweets and pies.

   A selection of official LFC Women merchandise is available to buy
   within the stadium including home shirts, LFC Women scarves, player
   cards and more.

   Official club mascot Mighty Red attends all LFC Women home games,
   meeting and greeting supporters ahead of kick-off and providing half
   time entertainment, inviting a lucky fan onto the pitch to take part in
   a penalty shoot-out game and the opportunity to win exclusive prizes.

   If you need help on the day, ask any of the stewards located around the
   ground who will be happy to help!

   What is a cookie?

   A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your hard drive by
   your web browser. We use cookies so as to be able to build up a profile
   of your interests and preferences and this may be used by us to make
   your visits to our site more enjoyable. Our cookies also enable us to
   enhance your visitor experience by storing information about the
   products and services that you select between visits so that we can
   provide you with focussed information each time you visit our website.

   In May 2012, the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations
   came into force in the UK. The regulations make it clear that all UK
   websites need to gain consent from people visiting the site to store
   'cookies' on their computers

   Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change
   your browser to prevent cookies being stored, however if you do turn

   Types of Cookie on Liverpool FC websites

   Strictly Necessary Cookies:

   These cookies let you navigate around our website and use essential
   features like secure areas, shopping baskets and online billing. These
   cookies don't gather any information about you that could be used for
   marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.

   We use these Strictly Necessary cookies to...
     * Remember things like information you've entered on forms when you
       navigate to different pages in a single web browser session
     * Identify you as being logged in to Liverpool FC websites
     * Remember when you have seen a single use page (such as the splash
       page) so we don't show it to you again and again.

   Performance Cookies

   These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for
   instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error
   messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that
   identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is
   aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
   website works.

   We use performance cookies to...
     * Provide statistics on how our website is used by our fans
     * See how effective our adverts are (we don't use this information to
       target adverts to you when you visit other websites)
     * Help us improve the website by measuring any errors that occur
     * Test different designs of our website

   Functionality Cookies:

   These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as
   your user name) and provide enhanced, more personal features. They can
   also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a
   video or commenting on a blog.

   We use 'Functionality' cookies to...
     * Show you when you're logged in to the website
     * Show you have a nickname or not and have or have not accepted our
       terms and conditions
     * Share information with partners to provide a service on our
       website. The information shared is only to be used to provide the
       service, product or function and not for any other purpose

   You can control whether or not these cookies are used, but preventing
   them may mean we can't offer you some services, and will reduce the
   support we can offer you. It's also possible that preventing these
   cookie stops us remembering that you didn't want a specific service.

   Targeting Cookies:

   These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order
   to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. They are also
   used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as
   help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They
   remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared
   with other organisations.

   We may allow the placing of targeting cookies on your device during
   your visit to the LFC website. This means that when you visit other
   websites who are part of carefully selected display networks you may be
   shown relevant product or service adverts from LFC or our commercial
   partners or 3rd party promoters of events at Anfield based on what we
   think you have shown an interest in. To opt out of this type of
   advertising then please go to the Network Advertising Initiative
   website. Alternatively if you regularly clear cookies in your browser
   this will also help stop this type of re-targeting advertising from
   appearing.

   Remember, if you wish to change your cookie settings or block cookies
   altogether please see http://www.aboutcookies.org/
