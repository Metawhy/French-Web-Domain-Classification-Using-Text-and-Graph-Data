Famous Pairs Cards

   I hope you are having a fantastic start to the 2013-2014 school year!
   It's so fun having time to get to know our students at the beginning of
   the year.  Building relationships is foundational to everything we do
   as educators, so I try to make sure my students spend a lot of time
   working together either in small groups or partnerships.
   For a few years, I have used famous pairs cards in my class that I've
   written on index cards.  Basically, these cards have an even number of
   words written on them (one word written on each card) such as cookies,
   milk, mashed potatoes, gravy, salt, pepper, etc.  When I'm ready to get
   my kids working together in pairs, I mix the cards up and pass out one
   to each student.  (If I have an odd number of students in my class,
   then I keep the last card and will be a partner to one of my
   students.)  Then my kiddos silently walk around with their cards held
   up next to their heads trying to find their famous pair.  They LOVE
   searching for their partner, and it's a trip to watch!
   So this year, I decided to make my cards a little fancier than the
   hand-written version and add a couple more features thanks to the
   inspiration of Dr. Spencer Kagan.  Sometimes, once my kiddos are in
   their partnerships, I want one partner to talk and the other to listen
   and then switch roles.  So I added an "A" and a "B" to each card so it
   would designate who is who.  When I say, "Partner A goes first," the
   partnerships will be able to start right away and no more Rock, Paper,
   Scissors to decide who goes first.  Also, there are times when I want
   my partnerships to link up with other partnerships, so I made sure
   there are 4 cards per color.  Finally, each card has a number - 1
   through 5.  If I need to, I can have all of the number 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s,
   and 5s gather together to share what was happening in their individual
   partnerships.  The bottom line is I wanted some flexibility in the
   cards, so I tried to add some of these features.  Here, look for
   yourself...
   Famous Pairs Cards
   [Famous+Pairs+Cards+1+image.png]
   [Famous+Pairs+Cards+2+image.png]
   There are 28 cards in all (14 pairs), so hopefully that will
   accommodate the largest class size.  God bless you IMMENSELY if you
   have a class size larger than 28.  Just print, laminate, cut them out
   and you're good to go!
   I hope you have as much fun with your famous pairs as I do!
   Enjoy!

Who Goes First? 40 Ways for Kids to Decide

   It's time for your kids to break out into small groups and begin
   working on a task.  Or they are about to start a game.  The first
   question I always anticipate is, "Who goes first?"  Here's something
   that will get your kids engaged in deciding who will start the activity
   or game.
   [Who+Goes+First+title+image.png]
   [Who+Goes+First+cards+image.png]
   There are 40 cards in all.  You can put these on a ring and just pick
   one randomly to call out to groups.  You can also randomly pick one to
   give to each group so that each group has a different way to find who
   goes first.  Of course, at the beginning of the year when you are
   setting your routines, you'll teach your students what to do if they
   need to have a tie breaker or if no one in the group satisfies the
   criteria.
   I've also created 5 spinners that can be used in the same way.  Kids
   use a paperclip and a pencil to spin the spinner.  These spinners can
   be put on a ring and hung in a convenient location.  They could also
   have a magnet applied to the back and put in a handy dandy spot so your
   students can get to them.
   [Who+Goes+First+spinner+image.png]
   I've also created a teacher card that has all 40 ways on one card so
   it's at your fingertips; you'll see it in the download.

ZABINGA! Telling Time Game with 5 Levels

   Zabinga!  It's a new twist that I've put on an old game.  And I'm using
   telling time as the skill for this super easy-to-play and super fun
   game.  Your students can play this game in pairs or in small groups.
   All they need is a set of leveled playing cards with some ZABINGA cards
   sprinkled in.  (Teacher directions for what to put in each game bag is
   included in download.)

                          [Zabinga+bag+image.JPG]
     Everything fits nicely inside a sandwich-size Ziploc bag.  So easy!

   I've designed five levels:
   [Zabinga+Level+1+title+image.png] [Zabinga+Level+2+title+image.png]
   [Zabinga+Level+3+title+image.png] [Zabinga+Level+4+title+image.png]
   [Zabinga+Level+5+title+image.png]
     * Level 1: to the hour
     * Level 2: to the hour and half-hour
     * Level 3: to the hour, half hour, and quarter hour
     * Level 4: five-minute intervals
     * Level 5: one-minute intervals

   These are available individually in black and white clocks as well as
   colored clocks.  Just click on the images above to hop on over to my
   TpT store.  If you'd like to grab all five sets, just click below.
   You'll get a lot more and have some more flexibility too.
   [Zabinga+Levels+1-5+title+image.png]
   In this PDF file, each level has different printable versions because
   everyone has different capabilities.  Some of us have access to color
   printers, and others of us don't.  So each level is provided in a black
   and white version as well as a color version.  I usually print in black
   and white onto bright card stock, and I use a different color of card
   stock for each of my sets.  It really helps keeps my sets together.
   I've also created each set in business card format using Avery Business
   Cards (2" x 3.5").  Can you say EASY?  You can grab a set of these
   business cards at the store for $11-$13 for 250 cards.  They are
   durable and so stinkin' easy to pop out.  NO MORE CUTTING ON THE PAPER
   CUTTER!!!  For those of us who don't have the means to get business
   cards, then each set is provided in a regular format.  Just print,
   laminate and cut out.
   ALL of this (actually 26 documents) is included in your download.  Woo
   hoo!
   So how do you play ZABINGA?  Cards (leveled playing cards with 4
   ZABINGA cards mixed in) are placed in the middle of the group.  On each
   player’s turn, she or he will take a card from the top of the pile and
   answer the question on the card.  If the answer given is correct
   (answer keys are included in sets), the player gets to keep the card.
   If the answer given is incorrect, the card is placed at the bottom of
   the pile.  If a ZABINGA card is drawn, the player must put all of the
   playing cards she or he has collected so far back to the bottom of the
   pile.  The ZABINGA card is then put aside in a different stack.  It is
   the next player’s turn.  Students will continue playing until all of
   the playing cards from the pile are gone.  The player with the most
   playing cards is the ZABINGA winner. Woo hoo!  I've made an
   instructions card that fits nicely inside a sandwich-size Ziploc bag
   along with the playing cards.  So, all your kids will need to do is
   grab a bag, pop a squat on the floor, and play!  Yes!
   Here's what the cards look like:

                                    [Zabinga+cards+image.png]
    This is the business card format provided in color as well as black &
                               white formats.

   [Zabinga+Level+2+non+business+cards+image.png]
   This version is the regular format (not for business cards).  It's
   available with color clocks or black & white.

                                    [Zabinga+cards+image.png]
     For each game, just use 4 ZABINGA cards.  Don't worry!  The teacher
                 directions tell you how to make game sets.

   Visit my TpT store to scoop up a copy of this telling time version of
   ZABINGA!
   But wait...there's more!  As I was making this game, I thought these
   cards would be PERFECT for a game of Scoot!  So, I've included some
   instructions for how you can play this whole class review game along
   with a game board.  Consider this your GIFT WITH PURCHASE.  If you have
   not played Scoot with your class, I cannot encourage you enough to give
   it a try!  It is so much fun!
   Enjoy!

Jazzed Up Memo Books {Freebie}

   Happy July! It's been a busy summer so far. Lots of fun training
   opportunities which means lots of reasons to appreciate the people I've
   been hanging out with. I have a tutorial to share with you that is
   super cute and super inexpensive.
   But first I wanted to let you know some exciting news. By spending time
   with so many of my friends this summer, I've had a lot of time to talk
   to them about my blog and all of the things I want to accomplish. One
   of the questions I'm always asked is, "Why do you always give your
   stuff away?" Well, I have always wanted to share what I use in my
   classroom with other people and if someone else can use it, then great.
   The more I blog and the more that people download my freebies, the more
   I realize that I would like to do more. I've decided in order to do
   more, I need a few more resources. Therefore, I've decided to open a
   TpT store so that I can continue to provide as many free resources as
   possible.  In fact, this free tutorial is my first "product."
   [page+one+image.png]
   I'd love for you to follow me on Bloglovin & my TpT store as well as
   grab this tutorial.  And please let me know how you appreciate the team
   members in your life.

Science Process Skills Posters {Freebie}

   I'm working on a professional development piece for my amazing
   district, and this class centers on helping our students develop their
   science process skills.  If you're like me, you might be like, "Huh?
   What are those?"  You'll recognize them when you see them.  They are
   basically the tools that our budding scientists use to carry out
   scientific investigations.  They are what they need in order to learn
   new knowledge.  And, I believe teaching them and giving our students
   lots of time to practice them are just as important as teaching
   content.  Check out The Institute for Inquiry for more information.
   I also believe our kiddos need to know what they are and when & how
   they are using them.  Here are some posters (8.5" x 11") from which you
   can use to teach as well as display in your classroom.
