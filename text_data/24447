   Andrew Yang, presidential candidate, serial entrepreneur, and icon of
   Silicon Valley futurism, has a vision. As you know if you’ve ever heard
   his name, Yang supports a universal basic income, $1,000 a month paid
   by the government to every American citizen, from part-time baristas to
   millionaire bond traders. To Yang, the UBI, as it’s called, is the
   answer to nearly every question about the economy. For out-of-work
   machinists, it’s a cushion that would make it possible to reorient to a
   new job. For would-be entrepreneurs, it’s the cost of ramen and a bed
   while they hustle to get off the ground. For stay-at-home parents, it’s
   recognition and support for crucial unpaid labor. For
   down-on-their-luck towns, it’s an economic stimulus plan.

   “This is the trickle up economy from our people, families, and
   communities—up,” Yang told Face the Nation in August. “It will create
   over two million new jobs in our communities because the money will go
   right into local mainstream businesses, to car repairs, daycare
   expenses, Little League sign-ups.”

   The plan is ambitious. Yang estimates that it will cost $1.3 trillion,
   more than a quarter of the current federal budget. That’s probably part
   of its appeal to the mismatched collection of libertarians, former
   Bernie Sanders supporters, and tech guys who have helped put Yang
   within the top ten candidates in a crowded Democratic field.

   The plan is also deeply flawed. Yang’s diagnosis of the problems that
   exist in the U.S. economy pits successful people against “normal” ones,
   preserves the status of the wealthiest Americans, and fits into a
   vision for federal spending that isn’t all that progressive. Yang’s
   campaign is doing an effective job of introducing the idea of universal
   basic income to millions of people, but it’s not showing how
   transformative a guaranteed stipend can really be.

   ***

   Over and over in debates and TV appearances, Yang has described
   automation as the key driver of economic change. “A wave of automation
   and job loss is no longer a dystopian vision of the future—it’s well
   under way,” Yang writes in The War on Normal People (2018). “There’s a
   growing mass of the permanently displaced. Automation is accelerating
   to a point where it will soon threaten our social fabric and way of
   life.”

     For the moment, the trouble most people face isn’t being replaced by
     a robot, it’s being exploited by powerful companies.

   In service of his argument, Yang showers readers with statistics and
   anecdotes: a devastating decline in factory jobs since 2000 and a rise
   in the number of potential workers who aren’t in the labor force; a
   computer program that can write a financial brief as well as a human
   can and a machine that can 3D print a passable pizza. “Right now some
   of the smartest people in the country are trying to figure out how to
   replace you with an overseas worker, a cheaper version of you, or,
   increasingly, a widget, software program, or robot,” Yang writes.
   “There’s no malice in it. The market rewards business leaders for
   making things more efficient. Efficiency doesn’t love normal people. It
   loves getting things done in the most cost-effective way possible.”

   But Yang’s warnings about automation don’t stand up against much
   scrutiny. The unemployment rate is remarkably low right now, and many
   of the workers who left the labor force in recent years have
   since reentered it. For all the jobs that have disappeared from
   factories, others have opened up in health care and food service, and
   there’s little sign of 3D printers and robots replacing line cooks and
   nurses any time soon. Even Yang’s go-to example, self-driving trucks
   replacing decently paid drivers, is less clear-cut than it might seem.
   No one really knows how long it will take to get vehicles driving
   themselves safely on all kinds of roads in all kinds of conditions.
   Even if technology advances rapidly, self-driving trucks will still
   need human support for quite a while—a driver on board monitoring the
   AI or someone watching the truck remotely, and maybe a human to take
   the wheel once the truck gets off the highway and has to deal with
   cyclists and potholes on city streets.

   The end-of-jobs rhetoric isn’t completely implausible in the long term.
   It could be that advances in machine learning and robotics will
   eventually transform the human relationship to work. But for the
   moment, the trouble most people face isn’t being replaced by a robot,
   it’s being exploited by powerful companies. The drop in manufacturing
   jobs matters because it represents a shift: from work that unions spent
   decades improving to service positions, which employers have largely
   managed to ward off from labor-organizing. Journalists aren’t being
   replaced by story-writing AIs, they’re being squeezed out by Facebook
   and Google, which maintain a stranglehold on ad revenue. Drivers may
   have to worry about autonomous vehicles someday, but their biggest
   problem at the moment is companies like Amazon that demand high-speed
   deliveries but deny employees the pay, benefits, and protections that
   union companies like UPS traditionally provided.

   At times, Yang acknowledges that automation isn’t, in fact, destroying
   all jobs. He notes that there are growing opportunities for home health
   care aides but writes that “former truck drivers will not be excited to
   bathe grandma,” particularly since these jobs are low-paid and offer
   few benefits. He offers no suggestions about who should do this
   necessary work—which is performed mostly by women of color—and he
   presents no proposals to raise salaries or interest in domestic labor.

   By talking about disappearing jobs rather than stagnant wages and
   degrading working conditions, Yang plays into the grandiose self-image
   of Silicon Valley. Technology only solves problems, according to this
   view, it doesn’t cause them. Per Yang, the “smartest people in the
   country” aren’t maliciously exploiting workers for profit. They’re
   simply creating a better, more exciting world that, unfortunately,
   leaves “normal” people behind.

   His plan takes care not to offend his friends and colleagues in the
   investor class: it would be funded with a value-added tax, of the kind
   imposed on goods and services to fund social programs in many European
   countries. People who receive benefits like food stamps or disability
   payments would have to give them up if they want to opt into Yang’s
   UBI. Ultimately, his message isn’t so much a challenge to economic
   inequality as it is a claim to offer non-ideological assistance. One of
   his campaign t-shirts reads, “Not left. Not right. Forward.”

   ***

   The notion of universal basic income has a long history. In 1795,
   Thomas Paine, inspired by his encounters with the Iroquois, wanted to
   give a one-time payment to every 21-year-old, followed by a lower
   payment each year after they turned 50. Around the same time, leaders
   of Berkshire County, England, met in the village of Speenhamland, where
   they decided to confront civil unrest and destitution by providing a
   universal stipend for the poor. The Speenhamland system, designed to
   make sure everyone could afford bread (whether they were considered
   “deserving” or “undeserving”), quickly spread across communities in
   southern England. The system shut down three decades later, however,
   after a government commission linked it to public ills such as idleness
   and overpopulation. Writers from Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx decried
   Speenhamland as a symbol of the evils that undermine work ethic. But in
   the 1960s and 70s, historians began reconsidering Speenhamland’s
   impact, and found that the commission had reached its damning
   conclusions based on preconceptions about labor rather than evidence.

   Since then, the notion of income support has bubbled up all over. In
   the United States, in the 1960s, a guaranteed basic income or negative
   income tax—essentially topping off the earnings of anyone whose pay
   fell below a certain threshold—was a mainstream concept embraced by
   free-market lovers such as Milton Friedman and Richard Nixon; Martin
   Luther King, Jr. was a fan, too. Today, the idea attracts appeal across
   the political spectrum: libertarians like Matt Zwolinski, a philosopher
   at the University of San Diego, argue for replacing existing public
   welfare programs with an income guarantee to reduce bureaucracy and
   loosen the government’s control over people reliant on social services.
   Liberals like Andy Stern, a former president of the Service Employees
   International Union, say that a UBI would give workers more bargaining
   power by letting them turn down exploitative labor.

     By talking about disappearing jobs rather than stagnant wages and
     degrading working conditions, Yang plays into the grandiose
     self-image of Silicon Valley.

   Recently, governments and nonprofits have rolled out UBI trials around
   the world. In Finland, a pilot program gave a randomly selected group
   of unemployed people a basic income of $632 a month between 2017 and
   2019. It found that the extra cash gave people a greater sense of
   happiness and security, even if it didn’t significantly improve their
   job prospects. In Ontario, a pilot program ended prematurely after a
   new government came to power. In the U.S., small local programs have
   been rolling out in cities including Stockton and Oakland, California
   and Jackson, Mississippi. So far, anecdotal evidence suggests that
   these trials are reducing participants’ stress and improving their
   sense of well-being.

   The idea of an income stipend has been part of the mainstream political
   debate in southern Africa for years. Since 1998, South Africa has had a
   large and growing child grant program—essentially a near-universal
   basic income for anyone under 18—which helps support more than 12
   million kids. From 2007 to 2009, Namibia had a promising basic income
   pilot program. Botswana has a longstanding program of cash and in-kind
   transfers that is one of the most extensive in the developing world.

   In Give a Man a Fish (2015), James Ferguson, an anthropologist at
   Stanford University, argues that the appeal of income supplements in
   southern Africa is related to its history with colonial exploitation
   and appropriation of mineral wealth. A politician speaking to poor
   youth will declare that South Africa is a rich country and ask, “To
   whom does it belong?” The answer is that it belongs to South Africans,
   the politician says. “And if it’s ours, then why do we not see any of
   the benefits?” Ferguson argues that this line of reasoning makes sense
   even in places where exploitation is less visible, and where wealth
   comes not from mineral extraction but capital-intensive production. “In
   fact,” Ferguson writes, “a high-tech factory is today not so different
   from an oil rig—a huge piece of capital investment that, once in place,
   pumps out unimaginable amounts of valuable stuff with only small
   amounts of supervisory labor.” When it comes to profit, he continues,
   “The key claim here belongs not to the wage laborers but to the members
   of society, the true originators of economic value.”

   ***

   That way of looking at wealth—as a product of society, not of
   individual tech entrepreneurs—could lead us to a different UBI model.
   Matt Bruenig, founder of the People’s Policy Project, has sketched one
   out. Where Yang’s plan takes off from the questionable assumption that
   automation is killing jobs, Bruenig’s begins with a proposition that’s
   already true: the richest one percent of Americans owns more wealth
   than the bottom 95 percent combined. Meanwhile, only 60 percent of
   American income comes as compensation for labor, which means that 40
   percent is earned by virtue of owning stocks, real estate, and other
   things that don’t involve clocking in. “There’s a small class of people
   at the top of society, and they own almost everything,” Bruenig told
   me. “You have a group of people that is able to dominate others.”

   Breuenig’s plan builds on an idea conceived by socialist economists in
   the twentieth century, which Sweden tried out in the 1980s. The plan
   was to gradually transfer ownership of corporate stock to public funds.
   Sweden’s initiative succeeded in buying up seven percent of
   corporations’ stock, but was shut down after a few years, when a more
   conservative government took over the country.

   In the United States, Bruenig proposes creating a national fund that
   would buy stocks, bonds, and other assets, possibly by using a big tax
   on capital to raise the initial investment. All adult citizens—perhaps
   excluding seniors, who already receive Social Security—would have a
   share in the fund and receive dividends from it each year. As owners,
   individuals would have the same rights to help steer their course as
   any other shareholder. To make that work, Bruenig suggests, people
   could vote by proxy—for example, by assigning their rights to an
   environmental nonprofit or labor group. In this way, Americans could
   have influence over corporate leaders just as they do over elected
   officials.

   Nothing quite like this exists now, though Bruenig draws comparisons to
   the Alaska Permanent Fund, which puts some of the state’s oil royalties
   toward an annual check to all state residents, and to a similar, much
   larger, program in Norway. He also notes that the United Kingdom’s
   Labour Party has endorsed the concept of an “Inclusive Ownership Fund,”
   which, like his plan, brings the idea of shared wealth solidly into the
   mainstream. “It’s not totally pie-in-the-sky,” he said.

     Looking at wealth as a product of society, not individual tech
     entrepreneurs could lead us to a different UBI model.

   Universal basic income still isn’t particularly popular among
   Americans, even with a high-profile advocate in Yang. At least in the
   short term, there are more promising ways to address inequality and
   corporate misbehavior, including the old standbys: regulating
   companies, taxing the rich, and encouraging the growth of unions. In
   the longer term, we might continue to develop the idea.

   Ferguson, for one, hopes to someday distribute money across national
   borders through a global UBI. “If the proverbial ‘man’ were to receive
   neither a fish nor a fishing lesson but instead a binding entitlement
   to some specified share of the total global production,” he writes,
   “then (and only then) would he really be fed for a lifetime.” If
   AI-based automation really does eventually take all our jobs, or if
   capitalists continue apace in concentrating wealth, that proposal may
   gain wider appeal.

   out. Where Yang’s plan takes off from the questionable assumption that
   automation is killing jobs, Bruenig’s begins with a proposition that’s
   already true: the richest one percent of Americans owns more wealth
   than the bottom 95 percent combined. Meanwhile, only 60 percent of
   American income comes as compensation for labor, which means that 40
   percent is earned by virtue of owning stocks, real estate, and other
   things that don’t involve clocking in. “There’s a small class of people
   at the top of society, and they own almost everything,” Bruenig told
   me. “You have a group of people that is able to dominate others.”

   Breuenig’s plan builds on an idea conceived by socialist economists in
   the twentieth century, which Sweden tried out in the 1980s. The plan
   was to gradually transfer ownership of corporate stock to public funds.
   Sweden’s initiative succeeded in buying up seven percent of
   corporations’ stock, but was shut down after a few years, when a more
   conservative government took over the country.

   In the United States, Bruenig proposes creating a national fund that
   would buy stocks, bonds, and other assets, possibly by using a big tax
   on capital to raise the initial investment. All adult citizens—perhaps
   excluding seniors, who already receive Social Security—would have a
   share in the fund and receive dividends from it each year. As owners,
   individuals would have the same rights to help steer their course as
   any other shareholder. To make that work, Bruenig suggests, people
   could vote by proxy—for example, by assigning their rights to an
   environmental nonprofit or labor group. In this way, Americans could
   have influence over corporate leaders just as they do over elected
   officials.

   Nothing quite like this exists now, though Bruenig draws comparisons to
   the Alaska Permanent Fund, which puts some of the state’s oil royalties
   toward an annual check to all state residents, and to a similar, much
   larger, program in Norway. He also notes that the United Kingdom’s
   Labour Party has endorsed the concept of an “Inclusive Ownership Fund,”
   which, like his plan, brings the idea of shared wealth solidly into the
   mainstream. “It’s not totally pie-in-the-sky,” he said.

     Looking at wealth as a product of society, not individual tech
     entrepreneurs could lead us to a different UBI model.

   Universal basic income still isn’t particularly popular among
   Americans, even with a high-profile advocate in Yang. At least in the
   short term, there are more promising ways to address inequality and
   corporate misbehavior, including the old standbys: regulating
   companies, taxing the rich, and encouraging the growth of unions. In
   the longer term, we might continue to develop the idea.

   Ferguson, for one, hopes to someday distribute money across national
   borders through a global UBI. “If the proverbial ‘man’ were to receive
   neither a fish nor a fishing lesson but instead a binding entitlement
   to some specified share of the total global production,” he writes,
   “then (and only then) would he really be fed for a lifetime.” If
   AI-based automation really does eventually take all our jobs, or if
   capitalists continue apace in concentrating wealth, that proposal may
   gain wider appeal.
