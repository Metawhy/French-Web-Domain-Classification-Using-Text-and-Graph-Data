Overview

   The research activities of the "Signal & Communications" group are
   currently divided into two main areas:
     * Statistical signal & image processing: analysis and representation,
       inverse problems and computational imaging, machine learning
     * Signal for communications: digital receivers, performance in real
       communication channels.

Short history

   Signal & Communications Group

   The ENSEEIHT Signal Processing group was created around 1968 (nobody
   really remembers!) by Jean-Claude Hoffmann and Bernard Lacaze. Its
   name, GAPSE, referred to "Group analyzing stochastic processes in
   electronics". GAPSE was part of the Electronics Laboratory (LEN7) of
   ENSEEIHT. Its founders chose the cross of Languedoc as emblem, such as
   it appears in a keystone of the cloister of the Jacobins (see
   opposite). In 1974, Francis Castanié joined the GAPSE and became his
   leader in 1978.

   In 1989, Daniel Roviras, was hired as a Professor with activities
   centered around telecommunications. The group was renamed as "Signal,
   Image and Communications" (SIC), within the LEN7 that had been under
   the direction of Francis Castanié from 1983 to 1996. New members
   successively joined the group: Corinne Mailhes (1991), Jean-Yves
   Tourneret (1993) and Marie Chabert (1998).

   In 1999, Francis Castanié founded a new collaborative laboratory, TeSA
   (Space Telecommunications and Aeronautics). The members of the SIC
   group working around the topics "signal" and "communications" moved to
   this new laboratory. The "Signal & Communications" (SC) group has been
   created, with Nathalie Thomas (2000) and Martial Coulon (2001) as new
   members.

   Many collaborations between some IRIT members and the SC Group pushed
   it to apply for CNRS affiliation. The official agreement has been
   obtained in May 2002. The SC group has joined IRIT in the Department of
   "Signals and Images".

   In 2004, Benoît Escrig, while Assistant Professor in ENSEIRB-MATMECA,
   asked to conduct his research activities within the SC group. In 2005,
   Marie-Laure Boucheret left ENST to join ENSEEIHT and to consolidate the
   Communication part of the SC Group. In 2008, Daniel Roviras moved from
   ENSEEIHT to CNAM Paris, and Bernard Lacaze retired. At the same time,
   Nicolas Dobigeon joined the group as an Assistant Professor. From 2009
   to 2010, Marco Lops worked with the SC group as a Professor. In
   September 2011 and January 2012, Charly Poulliat and Herwig Wendt
   joined the group as a Professor and a CNRS Researcher, respectively. In
   September 2014, Thomas Oberlin was recruited as an Assistant Professor.
   In 2016 and 2018, Cédric Févotte, ERC Consolidator Grantee, and
   Emmanuel Soubies, joined the SC group as CNRS Senior Researcher and
   CNRS Junior Researcher, respectively.

   From 2012, members of the SC group have been associated with the
   International Center of Mathematics and Computer Science (CIMI Lab. of
   Excellence), more recently as part of the Apprentissage Optimisation
   Complexité (AOC) project-team.

   Some of the SC members are currently involved in the Artificial and
   Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI).
