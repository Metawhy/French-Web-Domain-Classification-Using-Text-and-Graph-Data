   Meet Ruby Tuesday & Miss Ruby Tuesday
   Spreading its love since 2011, Ruby Tuesday is a fresh concept label
   based in the Netherlands. While it still has a young presence on the
   fashion scene, Ruby Tuesday brings forth an authentic, yet accessible
   look, which can be best transcribed as effortlessly chic and
   transparently timeless.
   After the big succes of the women's collection with it's iconic basics
   Ruby Tuesday decided to launch a small collection of fine pieces for
   the little ones.
   The people behind the brand are amazingly cool, kind and slow moment
   lovers, they know the drill since they got a full house of girls
   themselves!
   Ruby Tuesday will be in our store from Oct '12, Miss Ruby Tuesday from
   Jan '15!

Gorgeous Grey

   Grey is the most versatile and complex of colours, you can create any
   mood with the right shade of grey, from the palest silver to the
   darkest midnight.
   We love the softest grey from cool to warm to give a light
   sophisticated feeling to a room or exterior. Or dark and moody,
   envelope yourself and create drama.
   Our grey's are different, they are created with natural pigments which
   reflect light in a different way making beautiful natural warm greys.
   We love the softest grey from cool to warm to give a light
   sophisticated feeling. Or dark and moody...envelope yourself and create
   drama.
   YES we're going to meet the creatives behind our natural paint brand
   this weekend, proud and big smiles. Welcome BAUWERK COLOUR to our cool
   brands gang, our slow store, welcome in NL!

SLOW ART MUZE

   [leoniek+bontje+2.JPG]
   This year we will open our slow store Brands Unxpctd. Part of our
   philosophy is slow Art. To keep ourselves calm and pay attention to our
   sixth sense we have to slow down sometimes...
   Work of Leoniek Bontje
   Et Dieu… crea la femme (film uit 1956 van Roger Vadim met Brigitte
   Bardot)
   Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within
   it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound
   together. All things connect. (Chief Seattle)
   In most works of Leoniek Bontje (Purmerend, 24-12-1969), you see women.
   Women who look tempting and self assured, like Brigitte Bardot in Et
   Dieu… Crea la Femme. These women look strong, beautiful and lovely.
   They are made of threads, so they are also vulnarable and changable.
   The threads are like the lines of a drawing. But they are also symbol
   of ‘the web of life’. They represent the way of life, the relationships
   and connection between people. “For me, the threads represent the
   desire to be together, the connection between people. The threads can
   capture you, but they can also guide you like they guided Ariadne out
   of the Labyrinth, says Leoniek Bontje. “The threads tight you down and
   by cutting they give loose ends, so they also represent life lines for
   me”.
   Leoniek Bontje studied Fine Arts at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in
   Amsterdam and graduated in 2008. She showed her work in different
   places and galeries.
