Street battles rage in Yemen's Hodeidah, civilians caught in crossfire

   Mohammed Ghobari

   4 Min Read

   ADEN (Reuters) - Street battles raged on Sunday in residential areas of
   Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah, forcing medical staff to flee the
   largest hospital, as Houthi insurgents tried to repel forces backed by
   a Saudi-led coalition.

   Residents said they saw bodies of seven civilians killed in clashes in
   southern suburbs, with both sides using mortar shells, anti-aircraft
   guns and assault rifles in the fight for the Houthi-held city, a
   lifeline for millions of Yemenis.

   The coalition has renewed its offensive on Hodeidah as Western allies,
   including the United States, called for a ceasefire to support U.N.-led
   efforts to end the nearly four-year war that has killed more than
   10,000 and pushed the country to the brink of starvation.

   Medical sources at al-Thawra hospital told Reuters that several staff
   members and patients able to move had fled the complex. It was not
   immediately clear how many patients remained inside.

   “The Houthis are reinforcing their positions near the hospital and that
   is what scared people,” said one staff member.

   Hospital spokesman Khaled Attiyah told Reuters that doctors and nurses
   continued their work in departments such as intensive care, the burns
   ward and the emergency room “despite the panic”.

   Last week, rights groups said the Houthis had raided the May 22
   hospital in the city’s eastern suburbs and posted gunmen on the roof,
   endangering doctors and patients.

   The United Nations and aid groups have warned that a full-scale assault
   on Hodeidah, an entry point for 80 percent of the country’s food
   imports and relief supplies, could trigger a famine in the already
   impoverished Arabian Peninsula state.

   More than two dozen senior Obama administration officials, including
   former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former CIA Director
   John Brennan, called on U.S. President Donald Trump to cease all
   support for the war.

   In a telephone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on
   Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Washington’s
   call for “a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to come to the
   table to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict,” the State
   Department said.

   “We hear loud shelling and they are using all kinds of weapons, it is
   terrifying,” said resident Abdullah Mohammed. “In the eastern suburbs,
   Apache helicopters are bombing Houthi positions all day long.”

GRAIN MILL SEIZED

   Pro-coalition forces took control on Saturday of Red Sea Mills, a main
   grains facility south of the port which holds about 51,000 tonnes of
   wheat, a U.N. aid group said.

   “Around 60 shells fell inside the compound since the clashes reached
   that area few days ago but the silos and the grains were not touched,”
   said Ali Reza Qureshi, Yemen’s deputy director for the World Food
   Programme (WFP).

   “We hope the production will resume in the coming next two weeks as we
   get 21,000 tonnes monthly from those mills, otherwise we will have to
   import wheat flour,” he told Reuters.

   The WFP said last week it plans to double its food assistance programme
   for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people “to avert mass
   starvation”.

   The coalition has said that wresting control of Hodeidah would break
   the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line and force the group
   to the negotiating table to end the conflict, seen as a proxy war
   between Riyadh and Iran.

   The alliance, which relies on the West for arms and intelligence,
   intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally
   recognised government ousted by the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement,
   which controls the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital
   Sanaa.

   U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths has said he hopes to convene
   renewed peace talks by the end of the year after the last round of
   consultations collapsed in September.

   The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in
   Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centres at
   least 10,000 people had been killed.

Turkey says Trump working on extraditing wanted cleric Gulen

   2 Min Read

   DOHA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has told his Turkish
   counterpart Tayyip Erdogan that Washington is working on extraditing a
   U.S.-based Muslim cleric accused of orchestrating a failed Turkish coup
   in 2016, Turkey’s foreign minister said on Sunday.

   “In Argentina, Trump told Erdogan they were working on extraditing
   (Fethullah) Gulen and other people,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said, referring
   to the G20 summit where the leaders met two weeks ago.

   Turkey has long sought the extradition of Gulen, who has lived in
   self-imposed U.S. exile for nearly two decades. A former ally of
   Erdogan, he is blamed by Turkish authorities for the failed coup when
   rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and helicopters, attacked parliament
   and shot unarmed civilians.

   Gulen denies any involvement in the failed putsch. Trump said last
   month he was not considering extraditing the preacher as part of
   efforts to ease Turkish pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of
   Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.

   Erdogan said last week Turkey would start new initiatives abroad to
   target the financing of Gulen supporters.

   “I have recently seen a credible probe by the FBI on how the Gulen
   organisation avoids taxes,” Cavusoglu told a conference in Doha.

   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   Pennsylvania, U.S., July 10, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Mostoller/File Photo

   The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on whether the
   law enforcement agency was investigating individuals or entities with
   ties to Gulen for tax evasion.

   U.S. Representative Bill Pascrell, a Democrat, said that reports Trump
   was considering extraditing Gulen show his “affinity for strongmen.”

   “Mr. Gulen does not deserve to be a pawn in Trump’s attempts to cover
   up the murder of a U.S. resident for the increasingly lawless Saudi
   royal family,” Pascrell said in a statement.

Wife of Israeli prime minister goes on trial for fraud

   Maayan Lubell

   3 Min Read

   JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife,
   Sara, appeared in court on Sunday for the first hearing in the fraud
   trial against her, in which she is alleged to have misused state funds
   in ordering catered meals.

   According to the indictment, Sara Netanyahu, along with a government
   employee, fraudulently obtained from the state more than $100,000 for
   hundreds of meals supplied by restaurants, bypassing regulations that
   prohibit the practice if a cook is employed at home.

   Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.

   She was charged in June with fraud and breach of trust and of
   aggravated fraudulent receipt of goods. If convicted, Sara Netanyahu
   could face up to five years in prison.

   Looking tense, Netanyahu made no comment to reporters who had packed
   the tiny courtroom. She sat on a bench behind her lawyers.

   “Can we ask them to move the cameras away?”, she asked the lawyer for
   the other defendant, who replied: “You’re used to it.”

   “Not like this,” Netanyahu answered. She shook her head as the
   prosecutor described the gravity of her case.

   The session, however, dealt mainly with procedural matters. The judge
   set a meeting with the prosecutors and the defendants’ lawyers for Nov.
   13 in which he said he hoped all sides could narrow their differences
   “or even resolve the case”.

   But a settlement at this stage appears remote because the prosecutors
   would likely demand Netanyahu plead guilty, something her lawyer has
   ruled out. She was not asked at the hearing to enter a plea.

   Netanyahu’s lawyers contend the indictment does not hold up because the
   regulations for ordering meals were legally invalid and a household
   employee had requisitioned the food despite Netanyahu’s protestations.

   The prime minister, who himself is embroiled in corruption
   investigations, has called the allegations against his wife absurd and
   unfounded.

   Sara Netanyahu, 59, has inspired a multitude of headlines in the past
   over what family spokesmen call an undeserved reputation for
   imperiousness.

   In 2017 the Netanyahus won a libel suit against an Israeli journalist
   who said Sara once kicked her husband out of their car during an
   argument. In 2016, a Jerusalem labour court ruled that she had insulted
   and raged at household staff in the prime minister’s official
   residence.

   So far, Sara’s present legal woes have not politically damaged her
   husband, now in his fourth term as Israel’s leader and riding high in
   opinion polls despite the allegations against him.

   Accusations he has made against the Israeli media of orchestrating a
   politically motivated witch-hunt against him and his wife appear to
   have struck a chord with his right-wing voter base, which has rallied
   in support of the 68-year-old leader.

Bug business - Cockroaches corralled by the millions in China to crunch waste

   Thomas Suen, Ryan Woo

   4 Min Read

   JINAN, China (Reuters) - In the near pitch-dark, you can hear them
   before you see them - millions of cockroaches scuttling and fluttering
   across stacks of wooden boards as they devour food scraps by the tonne
   in a novel form of urban waste disposal.

   The air is warm and humid - just as cockroaches like it - to ensure the
   colonies keep their health and voracious appetites.

   Expanding Chinese cities are generating more food waste than they can
   accommodate in landfills, and cockroaches could be a way to get rid of
   hills of food scraps, providing nutritious food for livestock when the
   bugs eventually die and, some say, cures for stomach illness and beauty
   treatments.

   On the outskirts of Jinan, capital of eastern Shandong province, a
   billion cockroaches are being fed with 50 tonnes of kitchen waste a day
   - the equivalent in weight to seven adult elephants.

   The waste arrives before daybreak at the plant run by
   Shandong Qiaobin Agricultural Technology Co, where it is fed through
   pipes to cockroaches in their cells.

   Shandong Qiaobin plans to set up three more such plants next year,
   aiming to process a third of the kitchen waste produced by Jinan, home
   to about seven million people.

   A nationwide ban on using food waste as pig feed due to African swine
   fever outbreaks is also spurring the growth of the cockroach industry.

   “Cockroaches are a bio-technological pathway for the converting and
   processing of kitchen waste,” said Liu Yusheng, president of Shandong
   Insect Industry Association.

   Cockroaches are also a good source of protein for pigs and other
   livestock. “It’s like turning trash into resources,” said
   Shandong Qiaobin chairwoman Li Hongyi.

   operated by pharmaceutical company Gooddoctor in Xichang, Sichuan
   province, China August 10, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Suen

“ESSENCE OF COCKROACH”

   In a remote village in Sichuan, Li Bingcai, 47, has similar ideas.

   Li, formerly a mobile phone vendor, has invested a million yuan
   (114,307.45 pounds) in cockroaches, which he sells to pig farms and
   fisheries as feed and to drug companies as medicinal ingredients.

   His farm now has 3.4 million cockroaches.

   “People think it’s strange that I do this kind of business,” Li said.
   “It has great economic value, and my goal is to lead other villagers to
   prosperity if they follow my lead.”

   His village has two farms. Li’s goal is to create 20.

   Elsewhere in Sichuan, a company called Gooddoctor is rearing six
   billion cockroaches.

   “The essence of cockroach is good for curing oral and peptic ulcers,
   skin wounds and even stomach cancer,” said Wen Jianguo, manager of
   Gooddoctor’s cockroach facility.

   Researchers are also looking into using cockroach extract in beauty
   masks, diet pills and even hair-loss treatments.

   At Gooddoctor, when cockroaches reach the end of their lifespan of
   about six months, they are blasted by steam, washed and dried, before
   being sent to a huge nutrient extraction tank.

   Asked about the chance of the cockroaches escaping, Wen said that would
   be worthy of a disaster movie but that he has taken precautions.

   “We have a moat filled with water and fish,” he said. “If the
   cockroaches escape, they will fall into the moat and the fish will eat
   them all.”

Exclusive: Fake-branded bars slip dirty gold into world markets

   Peter Hobson

   15 Min Read

   LONDON (Reuters) - A forgery crisis is quietly roiling the world’s gold
   industry.

   Gold bars fraudulently stamped with the logos of major refineries are
   being inserted into the global market to launder smuggled or illegal
   gold, refining and banking executives tell Reuters. The fakes are hard
   to detect, making them an ideal fund-runner for narcotics dealers or
   warlords.

   In the last three years, bars worth at least $50 million (£41 million)
   stamped with Swiss refinery logos, but not actually produced by those
   facilities, have been identified by all four of Switzerland’s leading
   gold refiners and found in the vaults of JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of
   the major banks at the heart of the market in bullion, said senior
   executives at gold refineries, banks and other industry sources.

   Four of the executives said at least 1,000 of the bars, of a standard
   size known as a kilobar for their weight, have been found. That is a
   small share of output from the gold industry, which produces roughly 2
   million to 2.5 million such bars each year. But the forgeries are
   sophisticated, so thousands more may have gone undetected, according to
   the head of Switzerland’s biggest refinery.

   “The latest fake bars ... are highly professionally done,” said Michael
   Mesaric, the chief executive of refinery Valcambi. He said maybe a
   couple of thousand have been found, but the likelihood is that there
   are “way, way, way more still in circulation. And it still exists, and
   it still works.”

   Fake gold bars - blocks of cheaper metal plated with gold - are
   relatively common in the gold industry and often easy to detect.

   The counterfeits in these cases are subtler: The gold is real, and very
   high purity, with only the markings faked. Fake-branded bars are a
   relatively new way to flout global measures to block conflict minerals
   and prevent money-laundering. Such forgeries pose a problem for
   international refiners, financiers and regulators as they attempt to
   purge the world of illicit trade in bullion.

   High gold prices have triggered a boom in informal and illegal mining
   since the mid-2000s. Without the stamp of a prestigious refinery, such
   gold would be forced into underground networks, or priced at a
   discount. By pirating Swiss and other major brands, metal that has been
   mined or processed in places that would not otherwise be legal or
   acceptable in the West – for example in parts of Africa, Venezuela or
   North Korea – can be injected into the market, channelling funds to
   criminals or regimes that are sanctioned.

   Special Report: Gold worth billions is smuggled out of Africa

   It is not clear who is making the bars found so far, but executives and
   bankers told Reuters they think most originate in China, the world’s
   largest gold producer and importer, and have entered the market via
   dealers and trading houses in Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. Once
   accepted by a mainstream gold dealer in these places, they can quickly
   spread into supply chains worldwide.

   Word of the forged bars began to circulate quietly in gold industry
   circles after the first half of 2017, when J.P. Morgan, one of five
   banks which finalise trades in the $10 trillion-a-year London gold
   market, found that its vaults contained at least two gold kilobars
   stamped with the same identification number, 10 people familiar with
   the matter told Reuters. Reuters couldn’t determine exactly where the
   vaults were.

   J.P. Morgan declined to directly address questions about the fraudulent
   bullion, or comment on any of the details in this story. “It’s our
   standard practice to immediately alert the appropriate authorities and
   refineries should we discover mismarked gold kilobars during routine
   checks and procedures,” the bank said in a statement. “Fortunately, we
   have yet to have an incident resulting in a loss to the firm or a
   client.”

   Special Report: Wildcat gold miners doomed by their toxic trade

   The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which regulates China’s gold market, said
   in a statement it was not aware of counterfeit bars being made in or
   transported through China. “The Shanghai Gold Exchange has established
   a thorough delivery and storage system. The process for gold (material)
   to enter the warehouse is strictly managed and in compliance with the
   regulations,” it said.

   When others who store and trade such gold found forged bars, they
   returned them to the refiner concerned, some of whom have operations in
   Asia. Bars returned to Switzerland have been reported by refiners to
   the Swiss authorities who impounded them, refiners said.

   Swiss Customs said 655 forged bars were reported in 2017 and 2018 to
   local prosecutors in Ticino, a region bordering Italy that contains
   three of Switzerland’s four large refineries. “In all cases the marking
   of the 1 kg bars were fake,” a Customs official said by email, without
   commenting further.

   The public prosecutor in Ticino confirmed it had received three reports
   of gold bars with suspect serial numbers, but said it could not
   disclose more information. The police in Neuchatel, where Switzerland’s
   other large refinery is located, said neither it nor local prosecutors
   there had received reports of any forged bars. Switzerland’s Attorney
   General said its office was not concerned with the topic at present.

   Refinery executives said forged bars had also been reported in other
   countries.

HANDY FORMAT

   Kilobars are small - around the size and thickness of a cellphone -
   unlike the roughly 12.5-kilo gold ingots typically stored in the vaults
   of the world’s central banks. Kilobars are the most common form of gold
   in circulation around the world, passing fluidly between banks,
   refineries, dealers and individuals. The identifying features stamped
   onto a bar’s surface include the logo of the refinery that made it, its
   purity, weight, and a unique identification number. Each one is worth
   around $50,000 at current prices.

   In parts of Southeast Asia, it’s not uncommon for individuals to use
   gold instead of cash for big purchases such as real estate, bankers and
   analysts said. “It’s the only investment tool that goes from
   institutional investors like banks to the public and back again,” said
   an executive at a Swiss refinery.

   In China, almost all exports of gold are banned as part of the
   country’s strict, longstanding controls on capital movements. That,
   market analysts say, has spurred demand among well-to-do Chinese who
   want to send money out of the country to find ways to smuggle it.

   An estimated 400 to 600 tonnes of gold are snuck every year across the
   border from mainland China to Hong Kong in car boots and delivery vans,
   most of it in kilobars, said Cameron Alexander, head of precious metals
   research at consultants GFMS Refinitiv, which conducts detailed studies
   of global gold flows. Hong Kong Customs said it had received no
   complaints in the past decade about kilobars with forged trademarks.

   Japan also has a long-established problem of gold smuggling in which
   the forged brands could be put to use, refinery executives said.

   Swiss brands are not the only ones to have been pirated, but are the
   most targeted due to their global reach, executives said. Switzerland’s
   four largest refineries - Valcambi, PAMP, Argor-Heraeus and Metalor -
   process around 2,000-2,500 tonnes of gold a year, worth around $100
   billion. Their trademarks are among the most common and trusted in the
   industry. PAMP and Metalor declined to comment on the record; Argor
   said there was always a risk brands would be counterfeited, and
   recommended people buy bars only from trusted distributors.

   For recipients, the pirated bars pose a compliance threat: Anyone who
   holds such metal - including jewellers, banks and electronics firms -
   risks inadvertently violating global rules designed to keep metal of
   unknown or criminal origin out of circulation. The rules aim to staunch
   gold supplies that fund conflict, terrorism or organised crime, damage
   the environment or undermine national governments.

   Governments in America and Europe are legislating to force banks and
   manufacturers of items such as jewellery and electronics to take more
   responsibility for their mineral suppliers. For example, a clause in
   the Dodd-Frank Act adopted by the United States obliges U.S. companies
   to disclose whether gold they use has come from countries in central
   Africa where it could have been mined to fund conflict.

   Richard Hayes, chief executive of the Perth Mint in Australia, one of
   the world’s largest refiners, said his company had not encountered
   fraudulently branded Perth Mint kilobars. But, given the experience of
   other refiners, he has no doubt they are circulating.

   “It’s a wonderful way of laundering conflict gold,” he said. “The gold
   is genuine, but it’s not ethically sourced ... They look completely
   genuine, they assay correctly, and they weigh correctly as well.”

   The perfect appearance makes the bars highly effective. “Because gold
   is completely fungible,” Hayes said, “you can bleed it into genuine
   production. It’s very, very hard to control.”

   J.P. Morgan supplies gold from major refiners for many of the world’s
   biggest banks, jewellers and investors, and the discovery of the forged
   bars in its vaults triggered a full review of the gold it held, market
   sources said. One said this sweep unearthed around 50
   fraudulently-branded bars. Another said it found several hundred. J.P.
   Morgan did not comment.

   People in the industry familiar with the matter said the number of
   forged bars, and their high quality, meant their production must be
   well organised. An analysis of the bars’ movements suggested they had
   been made in Asia, probably China, they said. But the gold in them
   could have been melted and re-melted after being mined anywhere.

   J.P. Morgan responded to its discovery by deciding to stop buying any
   gold in Asia that had not come freshly made from a small clutch of
   refineries it trusted, five people familiar with the decision said.
   J.P. Morgan declined to comment.

   Other banks have also restricted gold purchases in Asia, 15 people in
   the industry said. “Anything that has even the chance of being iffy
   they are not going to be involved in,” said Alexander, the analyst at
   GFMS Refinitiv.

   Reuters approached five large banks that trade gold in Asia, several of
   which have vaulting facilities. HSBC declined to comment in detail but
   a spokesman said it only bought bars directly from a small group of
   refiners accredited, like the Swiss, by the London Bullion Market
   Association (LBMA). It said it had found no counterfeits. UBS did not
   comment on counterfeit bars, but said it only sells gold processed by
   LBMA-accredited refiners. Standard Chartered declined comment, saying
   “this is not an issue that affects us.” ANZ said it buys previously
   cast bars from “a select group of counterparties” and its policy, which
   had not been changed by the counterfeits, was to re-melt and recast
   them before selling them on. No one from ICBC Standard was available to
   comment.

THREE NINES

   The number of fake bars being found has dropped since 2017. But
   refiners say the forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so
   the problem may have grown.

   In 2017, Valcambi’s Mesaric said, hundreds of bars were found stamped
   with the same identification number. The bars’ markings also had
   spelling errors, flaws in logo images, or print that was too deep or
   shallow, other refiners said.

   Today, the forgeries are more precisely made, using what appears to be
   sophisticated machinery, Mesaric said. There can still be giveaways,
   such as indentations from a robotic gripper or repeated imperfections
   in a cast mould. But these are easy to miss.

   The most reliable way to identify the fakes is to test their purity.
   Gold is available on world markets in varying levels of purity: For
   professionally produced kilobars, the most common standard is 99.99% -
   known in the trade as “four nines.” An analysis of three
   counterfeit-branded bars by one Swiss refinery showed that two of them
   were 99.98% pure, and the third 99.90%.

   Though short of legitimate professional standards, even that level of
   purity is difficult to achieve, and takes advanced equipment to detect.

   Swiss Customs said of the 655 bars reported to local prosecutors in
   Ticino, the purity fell slightly below 99.99% in some cases.

   “The level of counterfeit is becoming really good. Even for us it is
   hard to tell,” said a Swiss refinery executive who spoke on condition
   of anonymity. “They are, however, slightly less pure because the people
   doing the counterfeits don’t have the equipment we have.”

   TAMPER-PROOF INK, MICROSURFACE SCANS

   The refineries are responding to the problem with technology.

   Metalor this year began to put spots of tamper-proof ink on its bars.
   Like the security features on banknotes, these display different
   features when viewed under certain light or through filters. PAMP and
   Valcambi perform a microsurface scan of their bars and supply machines
   or phone apps that can scan each one and verify whether their surfaces
   match the refinery’s records. Argor said its bars had various security
   features, but declined to elaborate for security reasons.

   The LBMA, which accredits global refineries to vouch for the quality of
   their output, is drawing up standards for security features. It has
   also proposed a global database containing information about every
   kilobar produced, as a way of cross-checking the products to add an
   extra layer of security. “Any security feature can be duplicated that’s
   on the bar itself,” said the LBMA’s chief executive, Ruth Crowell.

   But most of the refiners’ security features have only been introduced
   recently, and no database is planned until 2020 at the earliest.

Street battles rage in Yemen's Hodeidah, civilians caught in crossfire

   Mohammed Ghobari

   4 Min Read

   ADEN (Reuters) - Street battles raged on Sunday in residential areas of
   Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah, forcing medical staff to flee the
   largest hospital, as Houthi insurgents tried to repel forces backed by
   a Saudi-led coalition.
   [?m=02&amp;d=20181111&amp;t=2&amp;i=1324382174&amp;r=LYNXNPEEAA0MY&amp;
   w=20]

   Hodeidah, Yemen August 5, 2018. REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad/File Photo

   Residents said they saw bodies of seven civilians killed in clashes in
   southern suburbs, with both sides using mortar shells, anti-aircraft
   guns and assault rifles in the fight for the Houthi-held city, a
   lifeline for millions of Yemenis.

   The coalition has renewed its offensive on Hodeidah as Western allies,
   including the United States, called for a ceasefire to support U.N.-led
   efforts to end the nearly four-year war that has killed more than
   10,000 and pushed the country to the brink of starvation.

   Medical sources at al-Thawra hospital told Reuters that several staff
   members and patients able to move had fled the complex. It was not
   immediately clear how many patients remained inside.

   “The Houthis are reinforcing their positions near the hospital and that
   is what scared people,” said one staff member.

   Hospital spokesman Khaled Attiyah told Reuters that doctors and nurses
   continued their work in departments such as intensive care, the burns
   ward and the emergency room “despite the panic”.

   Last week, rights groups said the Houthis had raided the May 22
   hospital in the city’s eastern suburbs and posted gunmen on the roof,
   endangering doctors and patients.

   The United Nations and aid groups have warned that a full-scale assault
   on Hodeidah, an entry point for 80 percent of the country’s food
   imports and relief supplies, could trigger a famine in the already
   impoverished Arabian Peninsula state.

   More than two dozen senior Obama administration officials, including
   former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former CIA Director
   John Brennan, called on U.S. President Donald Trump to cease all
   support for the war.

   In a telephone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on
   Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Washington’s
   call for “a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to come to the
   table to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict,” the State
   Department said.

   “We hear loud shelling and they are using all kinds of weapons, it is
   terrifying,” said resident Abdullah Mohammed. “In the eastern suburbs,
   Apache helicopters are bombing Houthi positions all day long.”

GRAIN MILL SEIZED

   Pro-coalition forces took control on Saturday of Red Sea Mills, a main
   grains facility south of the port which holds about 51,000 tonnes of
   wheat, a U.N. aid group said.

   “Around 60 shells fell inside the compound since the clashes reached
   that area few days ago but the silos and the grains were not touched,”
   said Ali Reza Qureshi, Yemen’s deputy director for the World Food
   Programme (WFP).

   “We hope the production will resume in the coming next two weeks as we
   get 21,000 tonnes monthly from those mills, otherwise we will have to
   import wheat flour,” he told Reuters.

   The WFP said last week it plans to double its food assistance programme
   for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people “to avert mass
   starvation”.

   The coalition has said that wresting control of Hodeidah would break
   the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line and force the group
   to the negotiating table to end the conflict, seen as a proxy war
   between Riyadh and Iran.

   The alliance, which relies on the West for arms and intelligence,
   intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally
   recognised government ousted by the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement,
   which controls the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital
   Sanaa.

   U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths has said he hopes to convene
   renewed peace talks by the end of the year after the last round of
   consultations collapsed in September.

   The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in
   Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centres at
   least 10,000 people had been killed.

Turkey says Trump working on extraditing wanted cleric Gulen

   2 Min Read

   DOHA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has told his Turkish
   counterpart Tayyip Erdogan that Washington is working on extraditing a
   U.S.-based Muslim cleric accused of orchestrating a failed Turkish coup
   in 2016, Turkey’s foreign minister said on Sunday.

   “In Argentina, Trump told Erdogan they were working on extraditing
   (Fethullah) Gulen and other people,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said, referring
   to the G20 summit where the leaders met two weeks ago.

   Turkey has long sought the extradition of Gulen, who has lived in
   self-imposed U.S. exile for nearly two decades. A former ally of
   Erdogan, he is blamed by Turkish authorities for the failed coup when
   rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and helicopters, attacked parliament
   and shot unarmed civilians.

   Gulen denies any involvement in the failed putsch. Trump said last
   month he was not considering extraditing the preacher as part of
   efforts to ease Turkish pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of
   Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.

   Erdogan said last week Turkey would start new initiatives abroad to
   target the financing of Gulen supporters.

   “I have recently seen a credible probe by the FBI on how the Gulen
   organisation avoids taxes,” Cavusoglu told a conference in Doha.

   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   Pennsylvania, U.S., July 10, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Mostoller/File Photo

   The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on whether the
   law enforcement agency was investigating individuals or entities with
   ties to Gulen for tax evasion.

   U.S. Representative Bill Pascrell, a Democrat, said that reports Trump
   was considering extraditing Gulen show his “affinity for strongmen.”

   “Mr. Gulen does not deserve to be a pawn in Trump’s attempts to cover
   up the murder of a U.S. resident for the increasingly lawless Saudi
   royal family,” Pascrell said in a statement.

Wife of Israeli prime minister goes on trial for fraud

   Maayan Lubell

   3 Min Read

   JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife,
   Sara, appeared in court on Sunday for the first hearing in the fraud
   trial against her, in which she is alleged to have misused state funds
   in ordering catered meals.

   According to the indictment, Sara Netanyahu, along with a government
   employee, fraudulently obtained from the state more than $100,000 for
   hundreds of meals supplied by restaurants, bypassing regulations that
   prohibit the practice if a cook is employed at home.

   Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.

   She was charged in June with fraud and breach of trust and of
   aggravated fraudulent receipt of goods. If convicted, Sara Netanyahu
   could face up to five years in prison.

   Looking tense, Netanyahu made no comment to reporters who had packed
   the tiny courtroom. She sat on a bench behind her lawyers.

   “Can we ask them to move the cameras away?”, she asked the lawyer for
   the other defendant, who replied: “You’re used to it.”

   “Not like this,” Netanyahu answered. She shook her head as the
   prosecutor described the gravity of her case.

   The session, however, dealt mainly with procedural matters. The judge
   set a meeting with the prosecutors and the defendants’ lawyers for Nov.
   13 in which he said he hoped all sides could narrow their differences
   “or even resolve the case”.

   But a settlement at this stage appears remote because the prosecutors
   would likely demand Netanyahu plead guilty, something her lawyer has
   ruled out. She was not asked at the hearing to enter a plea.

   Netanyahu’s lawyers contend the indictment does not hold up because the
   regulations for ordering meals were legally invalid and a household
   employee had requisitioned the food despite Netanyahu’s protestations.

   The prime minister, who himself is embroiled in corruption
   investigations, has called the allegations against his wife absurd and
   unfounded.

   Sara Netanyahu, 59, has inspired a multitude of headlines in the past
   over what family spokesmen call an undeserved reputation for
   imperiousness.

   In 2017 the Netanyahus won a libel suit against an Israeli journalist
   who said Sara once kicked her husband out of their car during an
   argument. In 2016, a Jerusalem labour court ruled that she had insulted
   and raged at household staff in the prime minister’s official
   residence.

   So far, Sara’s present legal woes have not politically damaged her
   husband, now in his fourth term as Israel’s leader and riding high in
   opinion polls despite the allegations against him.

   Accusations he has made against the Israeli media of orchestrating a
   politically motivated witch-hunt against him and his wife appear to
   have struck a chord with his right-wing voter base, which has rallied
   in support of the 68-year-old leader.

Bug business - Cockroaches corralled by the millions in China to crunch waste

   Thomas Suen, Ryan Woo

   4 Min Read

   JINAN, China (Reuters) - In the near pitch-dark, you can hear them
   before you see them - millions of cockroaches scuttling and fluttering
   across stacks of wooden boards as they devour food scraps by the tonne
   in a novel form of urban waste disposal.

   The air is warm and humid - just as cockroaches like it - to ensure the
   colonies keep their health and voracious appetites.

   Expanding Chinese cities are generating more food waste than they can
   accommodate in landfills, and cockroaches could be a way to get rid of
   hills of food scraps, providing nutritious food for livestock when the
   bugs eventually die and, some say, cures for stomach illness and beauty
   treatments.

   On the outskirts of Jinan, capital of eastern Shandong province, a
   billion cockroaches are being fed with 50 tonnes of kitchen waste a day
   - the equivalent in weight to seven adult elephants.

   The waste arrives before daybreak at the plant run by
   Shandong Qiaobin Agricultural Technology Co, where it is fed through
   pipes to cockroaches in their cells.

   Shandong Qiaobin plans to set up three more such plants next year,
   aiming to process a third of the kitchen waste produced by Jinan, home
   to about seven million people.

   A nationwide ban on using food waste as pig feed due to African swine
   fever outbreaks is also spurring the growth of the cockroach industry.

   “Cockroaches are a bio-technological pathway for the converting and
   processing of kitchen waste,” said Liu Yusheng, president of Shandong
   Insect Industry Association.

   Cockroaches are also a good source of protein for pigs and other
   livestock. “It’s like turning trash into resources,” said
   Shandong Qiaobin chairwoman Li Hongyi.

   province, China August 10, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Suen

“ESSENCE OF COCKROACH”

   In a remote village in Sichuan, Li Bingcai, 47, has similar ideas.

   Li, formerly a mobile phone vendor, has invested a million yuan
   (114,307.45 pounds) in cockroaches, which he sells to pig farms and
   fisheries as feed and to drug companies as medicinal ingredients.

   His farm now has 3.4 million cockroaches.

   “People think it’s strange that I do this kind of business,” Li said.
   “It has great economic value, and my goal is to lead other villagers to
   prosperity if they follow my lead.”

   His village has two farms. Li’s goal is to create 20.

   Elsewhere in Sichuan, a company called Gooddoctor is rearing six
   billion cockroaches.

   “The essence of cockroach is good for curing oral and peptic ulcers,
   skin wounds and even stomach cancer,” said Wen Jianguo, manager of
   Gooddoctor’s cockroach facility.

   Researchers are also looking into using cockroach extract in beauty

   At Gooddoctor, when cockroaches reach the end of their lifespan of
   about six months, they are blasted by steam, washed and dried, before
   being sent to a huge nutrient extraction tank.

   Asked about the chance of the cockroaches escaping, Wen said that would
   be worthy of a disaster movie but that he has taken precautions.

   “We have a moat filled with water and fish,” he said. “If the
   cockroaches escape, they will fall into the moat and the fish will eat
   them all.”

Exclusive: Fake-branded bars slip dirty gold into world markets

   Peter Hobson

   15 Min Read

   LONDON (Reuters) - A forgery crisis is quietly roiling the world’s gold
   industry.

   Gold bars fraudulently stamped with the logos of major refineries are
   being inserted into the global market to launder smuggled or illegal
   gold, refining and banking executives tell Reuters. The fakes are hard
   to detect, making them an ideal fund-runner for narcotics dealers or
   warlords.

   In the last three years, bars worth at least $50 million (£41 million)
   stamped with Swiss refinery logos, but not actually produced by those
   facilities, have been identified by all four of Switzerland’s leading
   gold refiners and found in the vaults of JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of
   the major banks at the heart of the market in bullion, said senior
   executives at gold refineries, banks and other industry sources.

   Four of the executives said at least 1,000 of the bars, of a standard
   size known as a kilobar for their weight, have been found. That is a
   small share of output from the gold industry, which produces roughly 2
   million to 2.5 million such bars each year. But the forgeries are
   sophisticated, so thousands more may have gone undetected, according to
   the head of Switzerland’s biggest refinery.

   “The latest fake bars ... are highly professionally done,” said Michael
   Mesaric, the chief executive of refinery Valcambi. He said maybe a
   couple of thousand have been found, but the likelihood is that there
   are “way, way, way more still in circulation. And it still exists, and
   it still works.”

   Fake gold bars - blocks of cheaper metal plated with gold - are
   relatively common in the gold industry and often easy to detect.

   The counterfeits in these cases are subtler: The gold is real, and very
   high purity, with only the markings faked. Fake-branded bars are a
   relatively new way to flout global measures to block conflict minerals
   and prevent money-laundering. Such forgeries pose a problem for
   international refiners, financiers and regulators as they attempt to
   purge the world of illicit trade in bullion.

   High gold prices have triggered a boom in informal and illegal mining
   since the mid-2000s. Without the stamp of a prestigious refinery, such
   gold would be forced into underground networks, or priced at a
   discount. By pirating Swiss and other major brands, metal that has been
   mined or processed in places that would not otherwise be legal or
   acceptable in the West – for example in parts of Africa, Venezuela or
   North Korea – can be injected into the market, channelling funds to
   criminals or regimes that are sanctioned.

   Special Report: Gold worth billions is smuggled out of Africa

   It is not clear who is making the bars found so far, but executives and
   bankers told Reuters they think most originate in China, the world’s
   largest gold producer and importer, and have entered the market via
   dealers and trading houses in Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. Once
   accepted by a mainstream gold dealer in these places, they can quickly
   spread into supply chains worldwide.

   Word of the forged bars began to circulate quietly in gold industry
   circles after the first half of 2017, when J.P. Morgan, one of five
   banks which finalise trades in the $10 trillion-a-year London gold
   market, found that its vaults contained at least two gold kilobars
   stamped with the same identification number, 10 people familiar with
   the matter told Reuters. Reuters couldn’t determine exactly where the
   vaults were.

   J.P. Morgan declined to directly address questions about the fraudulent
   bullion, or comment on any of the details in this story. “It’s our
   standard practice to immediately alert the appropriate authorities and
   refineries should we discover mismarked gold kilobars during routine
   checks and procedures,” the bank said in a statement. “Fortunately, we
   have yet to have an incident resulting in a loss to the firm or a
   client.”

   Special Report: Wildcat gold miners doomed by their toxic trade

   The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which regulates China’s gold market, said
   in a statement it was not aware of counterfeit bars being made in or
   transported through China. “The Shanghai Gold Exchange has established
   a thorough delivery and storage system. The process for gold (material)
   to enter the warehouse is strictly managed and in compliance with the
   regulations,” it said.

   When others who store and trade such gold found forged bars, they
   returned them to the refiner concerned, some of whom have operations in
   Asia. Bars returned to Switzerland have been reported by refiners to
   the Swiss authorities who impounded them, refiners said.

   Swiss Customs said 655 forged bars were reported in 2017 and 2018 to
   local prosecutors in Ticino, a region bordering Italy that contains
   three of Switzerland’s four large refineries. “In all cases the marking
   of the 1 kg bars were fake,” a Customs official said by email, without
   commenting further.

   The public prosecutor in Ticino confirmed it had received three reports
   of gold bars with suspect serial numbers, but said it could not
   disclose more information. The police in Neuchatel, where Switzerland’s
   other large refinery is located, said neither it nor local prosecutors
   there had received reports of any forged bars. Switzerland’s Attorney
   General said its office was not concerned with the topic at present.

   Refinery executives said forged bars had also been reported in other
   countries.

HANDY FORMAT

   Kilobars are small - around the size and thickness of a cellphone -
   unlike the roughly 12.5-kilo gold ingots typically stored in the vaults
   of the world’s central banks. Kilobars are the most common form of gold
   in circulation around the world, passing fluidly between banks,
   refineries, dealers and individuals. The identifying features stamped
   onto a bar’s surface include the logo of the refinery that made it, its
   purity, weight, and a unique identification number. Each one is worth
   around $50,000 at current prices.

   In parts of Southeast Asia, it’s not uncommon for individuals to use
   gold instead of cash for big purchases such as real estate, bankers and
   analysts said. “It’s the only investment tool that goes from
   institutional investors like banks to the public and back again,” said
   an executive at a Swiss refinery.

   In China, almost all exports of gold are banned as part of the
   country’s strict, longstanding controls on capital movements. That,
   market analysts say, has spurred demand among well-to-do Chinese who
   want to send money out of the country to find ways to smuggle it.

   An estimated 400 to 600 tonnes of gold are snuck every year across the
   border from mainland China to Hong Kong in car boots and delivery vans,
   most of it in kilobars, said Cameron Alexander, head of precious metals
   research at consultants GFMS Refinitiv, which conducts detailed studies
   of global gold flows. Hong Kong Customs said it had received no
   complaints in the past decade about kilobars with forged trademarks.

   Japan also has a long-established problem of gold smuggling in which
   the forged brands could be put to use, refinery executives said.

   Swiss brands are not the only ones to have been pirated, but are the
   most targeted due to their global reach, executives said. Switzerland’s
   four largest refineries - Valcambi, PAMP, Argor-Heraeus and Metalor -
   process around 2,000-2,500 tonnes of gold a year, worth around $100
   billion. Their trademarks are among the most common and trusted in the
   industry. PAMP and Metalor declined to comment on the record; Argor
   said there was always a risk brands would be counterfeited, and
   recommended people buy bars only from trusted distributors.

   For recipients, the pirated bars pose a compliance threat: Anyone who
   holds such metal - including jewellers, banks and electronics firms -
   risks inadvertently violating global rules designed to keep metal of
   unknown or criminal origin out of circulation. The rules aim to staunch
   gold supplies that fund conflict, terrorism or organised crime, damage
   the environment or undermine national governments.

   Governments in America and Europe are legislating to force banks and
   manufacturers of items such as jewellery and electronics to take more
   responsibility for their mineral suppliers. For example, a clause in
   the Dodd-Frank Act adopted by the United States obliges U.S. companies
   to disclose whether gold they use has come from countries in central
   Africa where it could have been mined to fund conflict.

   Richard Hayes, chief executive of the Perth Mint in Australia, one of
   the world’s largest refiners, said his company had not encountered
   fraudulently branded Perth Mint kilobars. But, given the experience of
   other refiners, he has no doubt they are circulating.

   “It’s a wonderful way of laundering conflict gold,” he said. “The gold
   is genuine, but it’s not ethically sourced ... They look completely
   genuine, they assay correctly, and they weigh correctly as well.”

   The perfect appearance makes the bars highly effective. “Because gold
   is completely fungible,” Hayes said, “you can bleed it into genuine
   production. It’s very, very hard to control.”

   J.P. Morgan supplies gold from major refiners for many of the world’s
   biggest banks, jewellers and investors, and the discovery of the forged
   bars in its vaults triggered a full review of the gold it held, market
   sources said. One said this sweep unearthed around 50
   fraudulently-branded bars. Another said it found several hundred. J.P.
   Morgan did not comment.

   People in the industry familiar with the matter said the number of
   forged bars, and their high quality, meant their production must be
   well organised. An analysis of the bars’ movements suggested they had
   been made in Asia, probably China, they said. But the gold in them
   could have been melted and re-melted after being mined anywhere.

   J.P. Morgan responded to its discovery by deciding to stop buying any
   gold in Asia that had not come freshly made from a small clutch of
   refineries it trusted, five people familiar with the decision said.
   J.P. Morgan declined to comment.

   Other banks have also restricted gold purchases in Asia, 15 people in
   the industry said. “Anything that has even the chance of being iffy
   they are not going to be involved in,” said Alexander, the analyst at
   GFMS Refinitiv.

   Reuters approached five large banks that trade gold in Asia, several of
   which have vaulting facilities. HSBC declined to comment in detail but
   a spokesman said it only bought bars directly from a small group of
   refiners accredited, like the Swiss, by the London Bullion Market
   Association (LBMA). It said it had found no counterfeits. UBS did not
   comment on counterfeit bars, but said it only sells gold processed by
   LBMA-accredited refiners. Standard Chartered declined comment, saying
   “this is not an issue that affects us.” ANZ said it buys previously
   cast bars from “a select group of counterparties” and its policy, which
   had not been changed by the counterfeits, was to re-melt and recast
   them before selling them on. No one from ICBC Standard was available to
   comment.

THREE NINES

   The number of fake bars being found has dropped since 2017. But
   refiners say the forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so
   the problem may have grown.

   In 2017, Valcambi’s Mesaric said, hundreds of bars were found stamped
   with the same identification number. The bars’ markings also had
   spelling errors, flaws in logo images, or print that was too deep or
   shallow, other refiners said.

   Today, the forgeries are more precisely made, using what appears to be
   sophisticated machinery, Mesaric said. There can still be giveaways,
   such as indentations from a robotic gripper or repeated imperfections
   in a cast mould. But these are easy to miss.

   The most reliable way to identify the fakes is to test their purity.
   Gold is available on world markets in varying levels of purity: For
   professionally produced kilobars, the most common standard is 99.99% -
   known in the trade as “four nines.” An analysis of three
   counterfeit-branded bars by one Swiss refinery showed that two of them
   were 99.98% pure, and the third 99.90%.

   Though short of legitimate professional standards, even that level of
   purity is difficult to achieve, and takes advanced equipment to detect.

   Swiss Customs said of the 655 bars reported to local prosecutors in
   Ticino, the purity fell slightly below 99.99% in some cases.

   “The level of counterfeit is becoming really good. Even for us it is
   hard to tell,” said a Swiss refinery executive who spoke on condition
   of anonymity. “They are, however, slightly less pure because the people
   doing the counterfeits don’t have the equipment we have.”

   Special Report: Dreams of gold on North Korea's border

   TAMPER-PROOF INK, MICROSURFACE SCANS

   The refineries are responding to the problem with technology.

   Metalor this year began to put spots of tamper-proof ink on its bars.
   Like the security features on banknotes, these display different
   features when viewed under certain light or through filters. PAMP and
   Valcambi perform a microsurface scan of their bars and supply machines
   or phone apps that can scan each one and verify whether their surfaces
   match the refinery’s records. Argor said its bars had various security
   features, but declined to elaborate for security reasons.

   The LBMA, which accredits global refineries to vouch for the quality of
   their output, is drawing up standards for security features. It has
   also proposed a global database containing information about every
   kilobar produced, as a way of cross-checking the products to add an
   extra layer of security. “Any security feature can be duplicated that’s
   on the bar itself,” said the LBMA’s chief executive, Ruth Crowell.

   But most of the refiners’ security features have only been introduced
   recently, and no database is planned until 2020 at the earliest.

Google, Ford, Uber launch coalition to further self-driving cars

   David Shepardson

   3 Min Read

   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor
   Co (F.N), the ride-sharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and two other
   companies said on Tuesday they are forming a coalition to push for
   federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market.

   Sweden-based Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely
   Holding Group Co GEELY.UL, and Uber rival Lyft also are part of the
   Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The group said in a statement
   it will “work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the
   safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.”

   The coalition said David Strickland, the former top official of the
   U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the top
   U.S. auto safety agency that is writing new guidance on self-driving
   cars, will be the coalition’s counsel and spokesman.

   “What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs
   to be done for (fully autonomous) vehicles to be on the road,”
   Strickland said in an interview Tuesday, emphasizing the companies want
   to deploy them safely. “Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.”

   Strickland, who has advised Google on self-driving car issues, said the
   group is “a full policy and messaging campaign and movement” and not
   just about lobbying lawmakers or regulators.

   In 2014 there were 32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injured in 6.1
   million crashes on U.S. roads. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all
   traffic crashes are caused by human error.

   On Wednesday, NHTSA is holding the second of two public forums on its
   self-driving car guidelines that will feature comments from tech
   companies and automakers at Stanford University.

   NHTSA did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the
   coalition.

   Ford said in a statement the group will “work together to advocate for
   policy solutions that will support the deployment of fully autonomous
   vehicles.”

   NHTSA hopes to release its guidance to states, policymakers and
   companies on self-driving vehicles in July.

   California has proposed barring self-driving cars that do not have
   steering wheels, pedals and a licensed driver ready to take over in an
   emergency, which Google has opposed. Under current regulations, fully
   autonomous vehicles without human controls are not legal.

   NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind has said policymakers should avoid a
   “patchwork” of state regulations on self-driving cars but has not taken
   a position on California’s proposal.

   In February, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a
   self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal
   law, a major step toward winning approval for autonomous vehicles.

   The five companies, which all are working on self-driving cars, say one
   of the group’s first tasks is to “work with civic organizations,
   municipalities and businesses to bring the vision of self-driving
   vehicles to America’s roads and highways.”

Cameroon probes video showing security forces apparently executing civilians

   Josiane Kouagheu

   4 Min Read

   YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon’s government said on Friday it would
   investigate a video that Amnesty International said shows security
   forces shooting at least a dozen unarmed people in the far north of the
   country, where they are battling Islamist militants.

   It also announced the arrests of seven soldiers in connection with a
   separate video that surfaced last month appearing to show men in
   military uniform shooting dead two women and two children.

   Amnesty said in a statement it had verified the latest video through
   witness testimony, satellite imagery and analysis of the weapons,
   dialogue and uniforms. It said the video was shot in the village of
   Achigaya at an unknown date prior to May 2016.

   The nearly four-minute video has circulated on social media in recent
   days. A government spokesman said it was released to undermine
   President Paul Biya ahead of an election in October.

   At the start of the video, several men in military fatigues with
   automatic-style weapons joke among themselves, with one saying in
   French: “This is a kamikaze mission.”

   The men then open fire for roughly 12 seconds on about a dozen people
   sitting or lying down against a wall and under guard.

   After the firing stops, one of the armed men approaches the motionless
   bodies and fires several more times from point-blank range. Around
   them, several buildings in the village are in flames and gunfire can be
   heard in the background.

   “Here is yet more credible evidence to support the allegations that
   Cameroon’s armed forces have committed grave crimes against civilians,”
   said Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty International’s Lake Chad Researcher.

   Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said authorities would open
   an investigation into the video but the government was the victim of a
   “campaign of denigration” before the election, when Biya will try to
   extend his 36-year rule.

   “People want to discredit the army and president,” Tchiroma told
   Reuters.

SOLDIERS ARRESTED

   Tchiroma announced later on Friday in a statement that authorities had
   arrested seven soldiers, including a lieutenant and a sergeant, in
   connection with the previous video.

   The statement did not say when the arrests occurred. Reuters reported
   on July 19, citing security sources, that four soldiers had been
   arrested over the video — information that authorities later disputed.

   “The Minister of Communication reiterates the Head of State’s resolve
   to ensure that the atrocities that may be committed by a few misguided
   soldiers are systematically investigated and, if need be, appropriate
   actions meted out,” it said.

   Government and army officials had previously dismissed that video as
   “fake news” meant to tarnish the government’s image, even as they
   promised to investigate.

   The Cameroonian army’s elite Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) has been
   battling Nigerian militant group Boko Haram in the country’s extreme
   north since late 2014.

   Since then, the militants have killed hundreds of people in the Far
   North and their tactics have included the use of child suicide bombers
   to attack checkpoints, market places and mosques.

Turkish central bank dismisses chief economist, department managers

   Nevzat Devranoglu

   4 Min Read

   ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s central bank has dismissed its chief
   economist, Hakan Kara, and some department managers, according to a
   document seen by Reuters, re-igniting concern about political
   interference in the institution one month after the sacking of its
   governor.

   The decision was part of a reorganization to make the bank more
   effective, according to the document, and was taken at an internal bank
   meeting. It followed comments from President Tayyip Erdogan in July
   that the bank needed to be overhauled.

   Also dismissed were the bank’s research and monetary policy general
   manager, Pinar Ozlu; markets general manager Orhan Kandar; and banking
   and financial institutions general manager Yavuz Yeter, the document
   showed. Kara and the general managers were all given the role of
   advisers.

   “This move will further weigh on concerns around erosion of (the
   bank’s) institutional strength,” said Timothy Ash, head of emerging
   market research at Blue Bay Asset Management.

   Kara was the backbone of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
   research efforts and “the face of the CBRT for investors for almost two
   decades”, Ash said, adding his dismissal was a greater loss than the
   sacking of former governor Murat Cetinkaya.

   The document did not identify a new chief economist, but named several
   people as being appointed to fill vacancies in the bank’s economics
   team after the changes. More than 10 people were dismissed in total.

   The lira TRYTOM=D3 stood at 5.4970 against the dollar at 0830 GMT,
   weakening from a close on Thursday of 5.4700.

SHARP RATE CUT

   The document said the reorganization was carried out to facilitate “the
   effective performance of duties, the effective management of operations
   and the clear definition of departments areas of responsibility.”

   Last September, Governor Cetinkaya raised interest rates by 625 basis
   points to stem a currency crisis. Rates remained at 24% this year,
   preventing further losses in Turkey’s lira but helping push the economy
   into recession.

   He was sacked last month by Erdogan, who said he failed to follow
   instructions on interest rates and the bank had not properly fulfilled
   its role.

   Erdogan has often expressed the unorthodox view that inflation will
   come down when interest rates are lowered, adding that he expects
   stronger economic recovery in the second half of the year.

   At its first meeting under it new governor, Murat Uysal, this month,
   the bank’s monetary policy committee slashed its key interest rate by
   425 basis points to 19.75%.

   The bank cited improving inflation in its decision to cut rates and
   said its stance remained cautious. Inflation rose to a 15-year high
   above 25% last year, prompting the aggressive rate increases, but has
   dropped to 16.65% as of July.

   Erdogan, who has called interest rates the “mother of all evil”, has
   repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs to boost the economy, which
   shrank 2.6% in the first quarter, after a 30% lira slide last year amid
   soaring inflation.

   He first signaled moves to reorganize the bank in comments to reporters
   last month, saying Turkey could face serious problems if its central
   bank were not completely overhauled.

   JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel called on Monday for its arch-foe Iran to
   be denied any military presence in Syria, after Russia said Damascus’
   forces alone should control Syrian territory near the Israeli and
   Jordanian borders.

   “Our position on Syria is clear,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
   told his parliamentary faction in broadcast remarks. “We believe that
   there is no place for any Iranian military presence, anywhere in
   Syria.”
