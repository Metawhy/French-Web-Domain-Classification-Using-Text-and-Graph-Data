World Cardmaking Day - Dimensional Flowers Card

   Happy World Cardmaking Day Bella Blvd Fans! If there's one thing I love
   to add to my projects it's dimension. And when I can create dimension
   in a unique way, well, it just gets me so excited!  Christine joining
   you with what just may be one of my favorite cards that I have ever
   made! Check out all the details but also make sure to catch the quick
   process video at the end of the post for a close-up look!

   Dimensional Flowers Card

   When I looked at the Bella Blvd Blue Flower Cut File, it occurred to me
   that it could beyond initial appearances. I thought with the right
   layers, I could give it the look of a fall mum. Here's what I came up
   with!

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDThanks.October5

   For my patterned paper I opted to use the 6 X 6 Freehand Graph and Dot
   pad. This gave me lots of color choices and would allow me to choose
   more fall-like colors.

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDThanks.October5.CU2

   I cut the flower base in three different colors and then I cut the
   tendril-like petals in three different sizes. By varying the size and
   adding 3D Foam Adhesive in between I was able to create a fuller
   dimensional flower! I used a metal die to cut out some leaves and
   attached those in just a few spots so they would have the same delicate
   look of the flowers.

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDThanks.October5.CU3

   Of course, I can barely make a card these days without using my
   Florence Alphabets. They are simply the perfect size and you can always
   coordinate with the right color!

   Let's take a close-up look at how I created this card and these
   dimensional flowers in my quick process video!

   what you are creating with Bella Blvd files on this World Cardmaking
   Day! Thanks for stopping by!

World Cardmaking Day - Heart Hugs Background

   Happy World Cardmaking Day Bella Blvd Fans! What is your favorite Bella
   Blvd embellishment? If I had to narrow it down to just one, it would
   definitely be Heart Hugs. I find myself using them on EVERYTHING!
   Christine joining you today to show you a quick idea on how to use your
   Heart Hugs to create a background for a card!

   Heart Hugs Background Card

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDWishBig.October5

   As I was sitting and looking at my packages of Heart Hugs, it occurred
   to me that they would make a really neat background. I opted to create
   a monochromatic one - but I definitely think they would look amazing in
   ombre or rainbow colors!

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDWishBig.October5.cu1

   Although it looks like there's a lot going on, there really isn't a lot
   to this card! In fact just four products: Heart Hugs, Squeeze the Day
   Patterned Paper, an Acrylic Word, and some Nuvo Drops!

   Let's check out how I created it in this process video:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_j0wjAnas0?feature=oembed

   What do you think? Can you see yourself making a background with these
   hearts on one of your crafty projects? Thanks for joining me today!

World Cardmaking Day - Fall Cut File Card

   Happy World Cardmaking Day Bella Blvd Fans! While some cut files can
   make creating a card really easy, others are a little more complicated
   and time-consuming but still totally worth the effort.  Christine
   joining you with a Fall Cut File Card that I created using the Bella
   Besties Freehand Graph & Dot 6 X 6 Paper Pad. Be sure to scroll all the
   way down to check out the quick Process Video to go with this card!

   Fall Cut File Card

   This specific owl cut file does not come from a fall collection BUT
   because I used the Freehand Graph & Dot 6 X 6 Paper Pad, I was able to
   choose my colors and give it a fall feel.

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDUROwlsome.Ocboter5

   This was one of those fun, lighthearted cards that sometimes you just
   want to make. As soon as I saw the owl, I knew it would make for a fun
   and punny card!

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDUROwlsome.October5.CU2

   This owl is made up of lots of small detailed parts. A sharp blade and
   a slow speed on your machine will prevent tearing.

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDUROwlsome.October5.CU1

   My kids are all into puns these days so one of them will definitely
   love this card. Florence Alphabets made it easy to add my own cheesy
   pun!

   Let's take a look at the Process Video for how this Fall Cut File Card
   came together:

   Whooooo else is creating lighthearted cards today? How about cards with
   puns? Thanks for stopping by to check out mine!

World Cardmaking Day - Clean and Simple Card

   Happy World Cardmaking Day Bella Blvd Fans! Sometimes you just need a
   card to come together quickly without too many tricky techniques.
   Christine joining you today with a Clean & Simple Card combining layers
   of Patterned Papers, Heart Hugs, and a Bella Blvd Cut File.

   Clean & Simple Card

   Cut files are a great way to make a really simple card but still have
   it look fabulous! This tree card using the Bella Blvd Tree Cut File is
   the perfect example

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDLoveGrowsHere.October5

   I cut out the tree with the cut file but then I actually just did the
   circles using a circle punch.  Assembling the layers was quick and easy
   to do!

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDLoveGrowsHere.October5.CU1

   Bella's products all coordinate beautifully making the Heart Hugs a
   perfect embellishment for the Squeeze the Day 6 X 6 Paper Pad and the
   Bella Besties 6 X 6 Paper Pad.

   ChristineMeyer.WCMDLoveGrowsHere.October5.CU2

   Florence Alphabets are the perfect size for creating one of a kind
   sentiments as well as sentiments that coordinate perfectly without
   having to search through every product you own!

   Thanks for stopping by - hope you are creating some fun cards of your
   own today!

Squeeze the Day Cards

   Good day Bella Blvd friends, Tegan here! The new Squeeze the Day
   collection is so fun and fruity, I can't put it down! The mix of
   colorful fruits and berries just makes me so happy! And I am sure the
   recipients of these recent cards will be happy too! FUN TIP: I added
   strips of Squeeze the Day Washi Tape to the bottoms of white envelopes
   to add some fun to those as well!

   Bella Blvd_Squeeze the Day Cards_1

   On the first card, I adhered pieces of some of my favorite patterned
   papers from the 6x6 Squeeze the Day Paper Pad to my card base. I
   quickly added an adorable sentiment using an Ephemera die cut shape. I
   then embellished the card with a green Heart Hug cardboard shape and
   round Enamel Dots (which are available in the Heart Hug packs). So
   cute!

   Bella Blvd_Squeeze the Day Cards_2

   For this card, I used a rainbow of papers from the new Bella Besties
   Freehand Graph & Dot 6 x 6 Paper Pad as a background. I then
   embellished the card with Squeeze the Day 6 x 6 patterned papers and
   Ephemera Die Cuts. And of course I added a couple more adorable Heart
   Hugs!

   Bella Blvd_Squeeze the Day Cards_4

   On the last card, I used more adorable pieces from the Squeeze the Day
   6 x 6 Paper Pad and the scalloped edge rainbow sticker to embellish the
   base. I then used Squeeze the Day Ephemera pieces and Matte Enamel Dots
   to decorate the front. And I just love the texture that the Heart Hugs
   add!

   Bella Blvd_Squeeze the Day Cards_3

   Thanks so much for joining me today! I hope I have inspired you to grab
   some of the adorable Squeeze the Day collection for your next round of
   handmade cards! Have a great day everyone!

Squeeze the Day Cards | Erica Thompson

   I love making cards just as much as I love creating layouts! When
   creating cards I love to keep it simple and just like my layouts I love
   a crisp white base!

   ERICA.SNEAK2.OCT10

   I pulled out the Squeeze the Day 6x6 paper pad and embellishments to
   get started. I also pulled out some of my punches and dies! Using tools
   like this helps to create quick and easy cards!

   ERICA.SNEAK1.OCT10

   Another thing that helps make these cards quick and easy is no
   stamping! I use die cuts, alphas and stickers to create my sentiments!

   All 3 of my cards are A2 sized cards and the panels are cut down to 4 x
   5.25. For my first card I cut a punch of 1 inch circles with my circle
   punch and arranged them on the bottom of my card panel. I added a strip
   of black pattern paper from the 6x6 paper pad at the top of the punched
   circles and pulled out the super cute Bella Pop. I used the black
   Florence alpha stickers to add my simple sentiment! I love all the
   color and texture this card has!

   ERICA.ROSE.CREATES.BELLABLVD2

   My next card I used the Bella Bestie 6x6 paper pad and pulled out a
   rainbow of colors. I cut them down into strips and ran them through my
   scallop border punch. I adhered them to the left side of my card panel
   and then rounded the corners of the panel. I popped it up on my white
   card base and added a black heart with the sentiment Bananas For You! I
   love that pop of black on all that color!

   ERICA.ROSE.CREATES.BELLABLVD

   My last card I pulled out my circle punches and circle dies to create 4
   different sized circles. I arranged them on my white panel popping the
   biggest one up on foam adhesive. I pulled out the Squeeze the Day
   Ephemera Words pack and found the perfect arrow with the words You Did
   It to use as my sentiment! I added a chipboard heart and one of the new
   colorful epoxy hearts as well. I popped this panel up as well on some
   foam adhesive!

   ERICA.ROSE.CREATES.BELLABLVD1

   I hope you get some time to create some quick and easy cards! It is
   nice to create a bunch of these cards to have on hand.
