Protect yourself online

High-speed Swiss VPN that safeguards your privacy.

Why use VPN

Security

   Our secure VPN sends your internet traffic through an encrypted VPN
   tunnel, so your passwords and confidential data stay safe, even over
   public or untrusted Internet connections.

Privacy

   Keep your browsing history private. As a Swiss VPN provider, we do not
   log user activity or share data with third parties. Our anonymous VPN
   service enables Internet without surveillance.

Freedom

   We created ProtonVPN to protect the journalists and activists who use
   ProtonMail. ProtonVPN breaks down the barriers of Internet censorship,
   allowing you to access any website or content.

Unique Features for a more secure VPN

   Unlike other VPN services, ProtonVPN is designed with security as the
   main focus, drawing upon the lessons we have learned from working with
   journalists and activists in the field.

   SecureCore Icon

SECURE CORE

   Regular VPN services can be compromised if their servers are under
   surveillance. ProtonVPN prevents this by first passing user traffic
   through our Secure Core network in privacy-friendly countries like
   Switzerland and Iceland. Thus, even a compromised VPN endpoint server
   will not reveal your true IP address. Learn more
   PFS Icon

PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY

   ProtonVPN exclusively uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy,
   meaning that your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted
   later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future.

   Tor Icon
   Swiss Icon

SWISS BASED

   We are headquartered in Switzerland which has some of the world's
   strongest privacy laws. Switzerland is also outside of EU and US
   jurisdiction and is not a member of the fourteen eyes surveillance
   network.
   No Logs Icon

NO LOGS

   ProtonVPN is a no logs VPN service. We do not track or record your
   internet activity, and therefore, we are unable to disclose this
   information to third parties.
   Tor Icon

Tor over VPN

   ProtonVPN also integrates with the Tor anonymity network. With a single
   click, you can route all your traffic through the Tor network and
   access Onion sites.
