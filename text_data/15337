ALL OF THE PLAID // FALL READY

   Outfits // September 26, 2019

   Pants: Rodebjer (also head over heels for these). Top: Rodebjer
   (matching top to the pants here). Coat: Topshop (sold out, but I have
   picked up this plaid option and also love this plaid one). Shoes:
   Coming soon.

   Thank you to Nordstrom and ShopStyle for sponsoring this post.

   Bring on the layers! Fall is officially here, which means turtlenecks,
   coats, and all of the plaid! Whether you are looking for a chic plaid
   blazer, knife pleated check skirt, or oversized brushed plaid topper,
   Nordstrom offers it all. When I spotted these pants and this mesh top I
   immediately purchased them both knowing they would be amazing
   transitional pieces but also so easy to mix and match all season long
   back to my fall staples. If you are looking for something similar, take
   a peek at these plaid pants and also check out this mesh dress, this
   mesh top, and this mesh top!

SHOPBOP 25% OFF // SALE ALERT

   Outfits // September 25, 2019

   It is the amazing spend-to-get time at Shopbop – where you can receive
   up to 25% off your entire purchase with the code STOCKUP19! It is the
   perfect time to invest in a pair of timeless boots, treat yourself to a
   fun frock, or grab that pair of denim you have been eyeing. I ended up
   buying these pants, this sweater, and this sweater this morning! Scroll
   below to see some of my other sale picks. If you are in the market for
   a new bag, funky knit, or fancy frock, this is the event of the season!

   COZY AND CHUNKY // Cozy up in this lilac crew neck or this open neck
   teal sweater!

   ELEGANT EMBOSSED // These two bags have the look and feel of an $1,000+
   bag without the price tag. You can shop them here and here.

   FANCY FAUX // I’ve already warned you that this will be the fall of
   faux fur. This green coat and this striped coat are my two favorites
   and are also included in the sale promotion!

   PRETTY IN PINK (AND RED) // Pink and red will always remain a favorite
   color combination of mine. I just snagged this sweater in the sale this
   morning, but am also loving this striped turtleneck.

   NAVY LADY // I actually own this dress already and was sad to see I
   could have scored it at 25% off! Shop the floral frock here and polka
   dot number here.

   PREPPY PANTS // While I am typically a skirt lady, come fall I love a
   great pair of tailored pants. These plaid flares and these sailor kick
   crops both caught my eye.

   ENDLESS SUMMER // If you are looking for something you can still wear
   right now (let’s be honest it is still blazing hot in most places) –
   look not further. This dress from one of my favorite brands is included
   in the sale – and this tropical piece.

   GOING FOR GOLD // Shiny, glittery, and gold? YES, YES, AND YES! I am
   loving these mixed metal kitten heels and this statement gold sequin
   top.

   BRING ON BOOTIES // This sale is the perfect time to invest in a pair
   of boots that will last all season. These hikers will look so chic back
   to a plaid skirt, while these snakeskin boots will look incredible with
   your favorite pair of black denim.

   PEARLY AND GIRLY // Hair accessories are all the rage and this pearl
   bow and this pearl heart are too sweet to pass up!

NO. 165 // FALL DRESS RECOMMENDATIONS

   Notepad // September 24, 2019

   THROWBACK //

   What I wore to a wedding this past weekend! This is one of the most
   flattering dresses and is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. You can
   shop it here (and in another color here and find the top version here).
   I ended up wearing it with this headband, this bag, and these earrings.

   Question: Do you have any fall dress recommendations?

   Answer: Umm, obviously. I am always on the hunt for great frocks! Right
   now I am loving this dress for a formal occasion, this floral number,
   this animal print piece as a great transition option, and this dress
   and this dress for everyday!
