ADVICE & INSPIRATION

How to Throw a Valentine’s Day Party

   Posted By Camille Ulam

     * Comments

   Roses are red, violets are blue, we love throwing parties and so should
   you! Can you feel the love in the air, because we sure can. Valentine’s
   Day is always a fun day to have an excuse to celebrate under the name
   of L-O-V-E. Making Valentine cards with your kids and getting to eat
   the candy too, are some of our favorite memories together. What better
   way to celebrate than with a Valentine’s Day party?

   We partnered with Royale Ziegler, founder of @butlikeparty, to throw a
   Valentine’s party for the books.

   Presentation is everything when it comes to a V-Day party, and there is
   no such thing as too much pink and red. Luckily, Pottery Barn Kids has
   plenty of décor to get you through this Valentine’s day. We broke it
   down for you, so that you don’t have to stress over planning.
    1. Find a kid-friendly set of table and chairs to have the party. The
       blush spindle play chair is just the touch of pink your party
       needs. They pair well with the Carolina grow with you table. It is
       the perfect size for arts and crafts or eating a Valentine’s day
       meal! We have a range of tables and chairs for every personality
       that you can find here.
    2. Grab some pink and red tableware to incorporate Valentine’s day
       into your tabletop. All eyes will be on the table, so have fun with
       it! The “I Heart You” plate is an adorable addition to the table
       that will catch the kids attention.
    3. Use chairbackers as Valentine’s boxes so all your little ones can
       give and receive their sweet Valentines. You can even personalize
       the chairbackers with their names for an added special touch. The
       best part of Valentine’s day is giving Valentine’s to friends, and
       a personalized chairbacker will be the perfect place to receive
       Valentine’s. It can even be used for many Valentine’s days to
       come.
    4. Don’t forget the food! No party is complete without food and
       beverages. Make it on theme this year with red juice and DIY
       Valentine shaped cookies because who doesn’t love baking?
       Incorporating heart shaped food items is always fun for the little
       ones. Whether it is a heart shaped pizza or heart shaped pancakes,
       presenting it in a different way is always a must for a themed
       party! We even have a Gingham heart apron so all the little chefs
       out there can cook in theme!
    5. Most importantly, have fun and take lots of pictures!! Share the
       love with your friends and family this Valentine’s Day.

   Check out our Valentine’s Day Collection for more decorative themed
   items and gifts for the kids! Come shop these items in our stores, find
   a local store near you.

Baby Registry

Registry Needs when Expecting Baby #2 with Brittany Fullwood

   Posted By Camille Ulam

     * Twitter
     * Comments

   @brittfullwood

   Hi there! Britt Fullwood here- writer of Hello Honey, wife to Zach, and
   Mommy to Bear (6 years) and Boone (10 months). While I’m certainly no
   expert on the matter, it feels like we’ve tried every baby product on
   the market by now and have a good idea of what items every registry
   needs (and doesn’t!). Registering for our second son, Boone, was much
   easier than the first time but still a challenge. Now that Boone is 10
   months old, I can officially say what products both boys have truly
   needed, and I’m happy to share the top 10 with you!

   1. Nuna PIPA™ lite lx Infant Car Seat

   You will want a new, clean car seat for baby #2 and most importantly,
   one that is safe. The Nuna PIPA is known for being really light and has
   great neutral color options.

   2. Nuna DEMI™ Grow Stroller

   You’re never going to want to leave the house without a stroller, even
   more so than with the first kid! No matter the age gap of your little
   ones, life will be made much easier with a double stroller. I can’t
   tell you how many times I thought my 6 year old would want to walk
   beside me at the mall, but he asked to ride in the stroller instead.
   For us, this has been a splurge-worthy item. When we’ve skimped on
   strollers in the past, they never held up well and we regretted not
   picking out something more durable.

   3. Kendall 4-in-1 Convertible Crib

   Having two children makes one realize the importance of investing in
   products that last. One regret we had with Bear was not getting a crib
   that could be converted into a bed as he got older. Chances are you’re
   smarter than we were and already got a convertible crib for your first
   child, and want a quality one for your second child. The Kendall 4 in 1
   is a great option that converts into a toddler bed and later on a full
   bed so this could be the only bed your child ever needs. *A tip, go
   ahead and register for the toddler bed conversion kit, too. You’ll be
   glad you have it later on!

   4. Harper Baby Bedding Set

   I could rave about Pottery Barn Kids bedding all day, but one of my
   favorite things is how fun it is to customize baby bedding. Want it
   monogrammed? Check. Want to mix polka dot sheets with striped bumpers?
   Check. So many options and the quality is amazing. The Harper Bedding
   in navy will probably always be my pick for the boys because it’s
   classic, sweet, and goes with any nursery theme.

   5. Boppy & Cover

   One thing I didn’t register for with Boone that I regret is a Boppy
   pillow and cover. I pulled the pillow I used with Bear out of storage
   about a week before Boone was born and had to make a mall run for a new
   one. Just trust me on this, even if your pillow is still in good shape,
   you’ll want a new clean cover for snuggles with baby #2. Even sweeter
   when it has his or her name monogrammed on it.

   6. Inglesina Gusto Highchair

   Maybe it’s having messy boys, but our high chair went in the dumpster
   the minute Bear was done with it. That thing was gross. I don’t believe
   in spending a ton on a high chair because honestly, they’re not
   something you’ll use forever and they all serve the same purpose.
   Choose one that’s safe and sturdy, like the Inglesina Gusto Highchair.
   This one is under $150 so it makes a great gift for someone wanting to
   spoil your new arrival!

   7. Animal Friends Classic Activity Gym

   This is another item that you may have left over from your first child,
   but we tossed Bear’s since it had spit-up stains and he used it so much
   it was worn out. Activity gyms are excellent for stimulation which
   helps with nap time…in case you weren’t already sold.

   8. Nuna x PBK SENA™ Aire Playard


   This may be hard to believe but we didn’t use a pack ’n play much at
   all with our first child. We gave it away to friends when Bear was 2.
   Different story with Boone- we use it all the time for travel and any
   time I need to get work done around the house. I love that the mattress
   of this playard is machine washable which makes clean-up so much
   easier.

   p.s. this playard comes in our favorite Pottery Barn Kids print—Broken
   Arrow!

   9. Project Nursery Sight and Sound Soother

   Bear loved his sound machine from day one and still sleeps with it
   going every night, so I knew we needed one for Boone, too. Turns out
   it’s even more necessary for baby #2 to help drown out the noise of big
   sibling during nap time!

   10. Tula Free to Grow Baby Carrier

   We have and love this Tula Free to Grow Carrier; it was especially a
   life-saver during the first 4 months when Boone slept a lot of the day.
   I needed free hands to tend to Bear but still wanted Boone close to me,
   and the Tula Carrier allowed me to do both. I never used a carrier with
   Bear because I didn’t have to get off the couch if I didn’t want to,
   but a carrier is a necessity when you have more than one child.

   I hope this list has helped you with creating your own registry to
   welcome your newest addition. Whether this is your first or fifth baby,
   it’s important to remember that once you have the necessities,
   everything else will fall into place. Don’t stress! You got this. And
   thankfully Pottery Barn Kids makes the registry process a breeze.
   Congratulations on your newest bundle!

   Click here and let’s get started on your registry today! P.S. Pottery
   Barn Kids offers 20% off items remaining on your registry, so you don’t
   miss a thing!

ADVICE & INSPIRATION

3 Steps for an Instant Spring Room Refresh

     * Comments

   Spring is the perfect time to re-vamp your room. Whether it’s an added
   accent or a complete overhaul, it always feels nice to switch up your
   space.

1. Clean up your space

   What comes to mind when you think of spring? Flowers in bloom, sunshine
   and spring cleaning! Sometimes it can be hard to find a spot for
   everything. If you are looking for the ultimate storage solution, try
   out a storage bed. Keep the color palette neutral so that it will
   translate through all the seasons but add a spring touch with some boho
   accents like tassel bedding and fringe light. A little greenery also
   adds a natural element to the room. Want to shop this room? Click here!

   Perfect for neatly organizing everything from books to clothing to
   linens, our sturdy bins provide a shining example of how to stow away
   in style.

2. Deck out your desk area

   Even though spring break may be right around the corner, your desk
   doesn’t only have to be used for studying. Try out a new hobby like
   drawing or creating mood boards in your time off. Our wire wall accents
   are the perfect place to showcase your favorite memories, mementos and
   inspo. Toss in a cozy desk chair and you’re on your way to achieving
   #deskgoals!

3. WAKE UP YOUR WALLS

   One of the easier ways to quickly and easily update your room is to
   hang up artwork. Try one eye-catching piece or go for a full-on gallery
   wall to achieve instant wow-factor. Eyes are usually drawn towards
   statement-making wall decor first. If you’re looking to create a
   gallery wall but are not sure where to start, pick a few pieces in a
   similar color scheme (neutrals and black are always safe bets). Mix and
   match different sizes. Try re-arranging them a few different ways to
   see which you prefer. For an added bold effect, mix and match frame
   colors, like we did in the photo above. Click here to check out all of
   our new prints and canvas art!
