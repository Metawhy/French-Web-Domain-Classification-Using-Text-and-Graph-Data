Hey There!

   Has it really been almost 18 months since I blogged in our little
   family journal?!
   Image may contain: 6 people, people smiling, people standing, outdoor
   and nature
   This blog will always be near and dear to my heart. I started this
   online journal for our family exactly 10 years ago last month to help
   document our mostly mundane, day-to-day happenings. Milestones like
   Carson laughing for the first time, to Harper's first steps;
   documenting Grant's complicated medical issues, and announcing
   pregnancies...I love to look back from time to time and read through
   poignant-and even the not so poignant-moments of our lives.
   That's why I hate so much that I "abandoned" our family journal.
   Thankfully, I did document the big stuff on Instagram...but its just
   not quite the same.
   I've thought about picking up the laptop and sitting down to write over
   the last year, but the words just didn't come.  Life has been hard. Our
   world was shattered, however, God is slowly rebuilding us, piece by
   piece. It has been the darkest, most unrelenting season of my life, but
   God is good, and God has been faithful to our family.
   There is no way to document every important event over the last 18
   months in one post, so I'll just share a few updates instead:

   outdoor and nature
   The kids are amazing. Carson just turned 10 (my heart cannot even
   handle it!), Harper is coming up on his 9th birthday, Grant will be 5
   (!!!) in a few weeks, and Clara-our tiny baby-just turned 2.
   Our day to day lives are c.r.a.z.y. busy. Grant started preschool last
   fall, so all three boys are in school now! Grant is in an exceptionally
   challenged classroom, and is doing SO awesome! He absolutely loves
   school, and it has been such a huge blessing for him! Along with the
   services he receives at school, he still has private therapy 2x a week,
   which means a lot of running around town to appointments.

   Carson and Harper are both playing basketball again this season, and
   they are having a blast! Carson's in an older league this year, so he
   has practice one evening a week, along with games on Saturdays. Harper
   has a practice/game every Saturday morning, so balancing their
   schedules has been...interesting! Carson is also on the Science
   Olympiad team at school, so he stays after school one day a week for
   several hours and does his science-club thing. üòÅ

   Kane's work schedule is different now-he works on Saturdays (huge
   bummer!) and has a weekday off instead.
   My mornings consist of chasing after a certain little girl with a VERY
   big personality...

   Our Clara girl is just a little bundle of spunk. She LOVES to sing,
   follow her brothers around, get into anything and everything, and go
   "swimin' in the baff-tub" üòâ
   2017 is such a big year for us! Kane and I are celebrating our 10 year
   anniversary this year! We like to joke that it seems like we've been
   married more like 20 years, ha! We are planning a fun little getaway
   for our anniversary-hoping to have those plans finalized this week!

   I'm hoping to get back into the swing of blogging...even if its just to
   make a birthday post-I'd love to keep up with our journal.
   All for now!
   Maria.

Summer recap and Fall happenings!

   *Be prepared for lots of rambling and lots of pictures!
   I cannot believe its been so long since I've posted! Looks like I took
   the summer (& then some!) off, so I really wanted to update my little
   blog and do a quick recap!
   Life with four kiddos is BUSY. We are constantly going, going, going.
   We had a really great summer...Grant has therapy 3 mornings a week (2
   speech sessions and 1 hour of OT), so as you can imagine, the driving
   back and forth as well as the therapy time itself takes up a lot of
   time. Almost every Monday of summer break I took the kids to the
   library and they picked out a few books to read while we were in the
   waiting room. And of course we have our weekly Target trip and a
   grocery store/errands morning too.We usually spent most of our
   afternoons swimming at my parents pool and trying to beat the heat!

   [11385556_1446001665705826_1151507842_n.jpg]
   4th of July!
   [11374563_1438003753191238_1326830277_n.jpg]
   [11378596_1491899917768093_518690698_n.jpg]
   In July we had our family vacation at Great Wolf Lodge in Charlotte. We
   wanted to stay somewhere closeish to home (aka little travel with a
   baby!) & we wanted something that would work for our WHOLE family, and
   Great Wolf Lodge was PERFECT. Its an indoor water park resort that has
   areas for the whole family. I spent most of my time in the kiddie area
   with Grant and Clara while Kane and the boys hit up all the water
   slides. It was surprisingly relaxing for me-Grant had a blast playing
   in the baby/toddler area and since it only goes to 1.5 foot deep, he
   could navigate the whole area without me having to follow him around.
   Clara and I sat in the zero depth area and she splashed away! Kane and
   the boys would always swing by & come check on us every 45min-hour and
   I would go on a few rides with the boys then too. The best part was
   that our hotel room was just down the hallway from the entrance to the
   water park so I could go back to the room with the babies whenever I
   needed! That was great for when Clara would get cranky and needed a nap
   & Grant needed a snack or something. We would leave and go out to
   dinner every night, & then return for late night fun at the resort
   arcade and bowling area. The last day there, we left that afternoon and
   stayed at a different hotel in Charlotte so that we could take the boys
   to visit a few landmarks. We went to the Carolina Panthers Stadium & we
   toured the Billy Graham library (which was so cool!! so much history
   there!). We had SUCH a good week & made so many wonderful memories with
   the kids...we are already planning to go back again when we can!!

   [BeFunky%2BCollage4.jpg]
   After being home for ONE day from our vacation, me and Kane turned
   around and went back to Charlotte for Kane's annual meeting with
   corporate. He spent the morning and early afternoon in a meeting, and I
   had a glorious day shopping and eating lunch BY MYSELF, which never
   ever EVER happens. I missed the kids like crazy (esp Clara since it was
   the first time I had ever left her), but it was so needed. I really
   needed that little break. Once Kane got out of his meeting, we went
   back to the hotel for a few hours and then headed to a cookout at the
   president of the company's home on Lake Norman.
   [11410439_1661147097441858_56568945_n.jpg]
   The first week of August brought the start of football for Carson! Harp
   decided not to play this year (he would rather play on the playground
   with the other kids), & that has taken up a huge chunk of time. He has
   improved SO much since the start of the season, so its nice to see the
   hard work pay off!
   [11849871_904306176290646_922683127_n.jpg]
   The end of August means back to school time! Our summer felt like it
   went by SO fast, but even so, the boys were ready to go back and to see
   their friends. They both love school SO much, and we all enjoy the
   routine school brings! Carson started 3rd grade this year and Harp's in
   2nd! They both have amazing teachers this year and I am SO excited
   about that!
   [11880689_10207443467868016_8655283365535586937_n.jpg]
   Our Clara girl is growing so fast! She is just two months away from her
   first birthday and my heart can hardly stand it. Her (big) personality
   is really starting to show! She is such a friendly baby with a streak
   of sassy with a little drama thrown in. ;) I'm told it a girl thing,
   ha! She started crawling right after our trip to Great Wolf (I could
   tell she wanted to while we were vacationing...she almost took off a
   few times in the hotel room), and shortly after that she started
   pulling to a stand & now shes cruising around the furniture! She loves
   to clap and her favorite song is "If you're happy and you know it." She
   can wave (at herself, ha!) and can say "hi" and "dada." She loves to
   dance and follow her brothers around (mainly Grant), and her newest
   favorite thing to do as of late is pull all the books off the bookshelf
   in her room. I can't even express how much joy she has brought to our
   family!
   8 months:

   [11872135_10207348121244410_7182437562141101426_o.jpg]
   I wanted to jot this down for future purposes, but Grant is doing SO
   wonderful lately. He is really developing and his hard work in both
   speech and OT is finally starting to pay off. He still has a way to go,
   of course, but I just wanted to mention how excited I am for him. We
   spent the summer working on preschool stuff & he mastered identifying
   all of the alphabet, & identifying shapes (he already knew colors &
   numbers for a long time now ;). In OT he is working on pre-writing
   skills & using scissors, which has been trickier for him-he has fine
   motor delays (VERY likely due to his poor eyesight). It has been a
   long, long road with lots of tears and prayers. My personal goal for
   him and my main hope and prayer is that we can get him caught up to
   where he needs to be by the start of kindergarten. We have so much
   ground to cover, but I really think it can be done!
   [11373839_1061941220496832_1173295926_n.jpg]
   Well thats all for now! Hope to start blogging again more regularly! :)
   Check back in a few days for pictures of my girl at 10 months!

Clara is SIX MONTHS Old!

   Our precious baby is already halfway through her first year! How in the
   world can it be? Clara is the sweetest baby with the best
   disposition...Always so happy, with a big smile on her face. She loves
   her toys, her feet, and is in LOVE with her big brothers. She just
   lights up when the boys are around! She has the BEST girly,
   high-pitched giggle that gets every one cracking up. She is so tiny
   compared to the boys, with a head full of curly hair, and big dark eyes
   (they haven't settled yet, but I'm thinking they'll be hazel or brown).
   Sweet girl has been sleeping through the night since she was about 2
   months old or so, and wears mainly 3-6 month clothing, and some 6-9
   month stuff, too. :) She has her check up next week so I'll know her
   stats then.
   I took her to the beach yesterday to take her 6 month pictures and she
   loved watching the ocean, but was not a fan of the sand! :)
   Here are some pictures from the day!

The Fog is Clearing

   I have 4 kids now.
   Some days I can't even wrap my brain around that. FOUR. We've been a
   family of six for almost 6 months now (how are we already halfway
   through Clara's first year?!), and the fog is finally clearing. We are
   in our groove, our new normal. I'm feeling more and more like myself.
   I hate that I haven't kept up with our little family journal so I'm
   going to post a bunch of pictures with random captions to catch up on
   whats been going on over the last several months!
   Here goes:
   I took this of the kiddos back in March. I wanted a picture of them all
   together. Holy Cow. I felt like I had wrestled a bear trying to get a
   picture of all them looking at me, but I managed to snag one. (secret:
   Carson's eyes were actually closed in this one, so I had to photoshop
   his eyes.)
   [IMG_9442ed4.jpg]
   Heres another group pic: I think this was before my mom's birthday
   dinner at the end of March!

   little life like I did with the boys! ;)

   Festival! He was super proud (and we were, too!)
   [11190000_1605783809700943_703009530_n.jpg]
   So...I just realized I submitted this post before finishing this post
   sometime last week...maybe the fog hasn't cleared as much as I had
   thought, ha!
   Continuing...
   I can't forget to mention how much progress Grant has made! I decided
   to get him evaluated for Occupation Therapy right after his 3rd
   birthday. He definitely qualified for services, so he goes for 1 hour
   every week. I really think it has been wonderful for him! Apart of OT
   is feeding therapy and ever since he started, he has been eating SOO
   much better. I also requested around his 3rd birthday for an extra
   speech therapy session which was obviously approved. So he goes to
   speech 2x a week now (once at the office and once at home). After the
   summer I am going to push for both sessions being at the office...I
   really think it benefits him SO much more than the sessions at home.
   Anyways, enough rambling with that!
    Grant always uses 2-4 word phrases now...that doesn't seem like a big
   deal, but it is HUGE for him. He was evaluated for speech during our
   annual craniofacial appointment back in March, and the speech
   pathologist there thinks he has a touch of Apraxia of Speech (which,
   thanks to my "Medical License" in google, I had already gathered he
   had, ha!). Anyways, for Grant that means his brain is not being able to
   put a sentence together, despite being able to say each individual word
   correctly. For example, if you ask him to say "I love going outside!"
   he can say each of those words individually "i" "love" "going"
   "outside" however, when you tell him to say it as a sentence, "I love
   going" ends up becoming jumbled gibberish and he'll end with "outside".
   Its confusing and complicated,  but it suits Grant because NOTHING with
   him is ever easy! :)
   Potty training....is not going. We're on a break until schools out for
   the boys. He understands the concept, he knows what he is suppose to
   do, he can say the words, recognize when he urinates, stay dry for long
   periods of time. It is not a battle of the wills, it is 100 percent a
   sensory issue. I have a game plan in place but honestly its more of a
   Clara issue at this point-I need her to be a little older so I can
   devote the time and effort to potty train Grant.
   Last but not least...we went back for a repeat hearing test on
   Friday...they weren't able to get the results (which is very
   frustrating because I told them on the phone they wouldn't be able
   to...not getting into that right now, though...), so we are going back
   for a sedated hearing test next. We will know definitely if there is or
   is not hearing loss.
     [11176333_1382128865450946_463078348_n.jpg]
   Carson and Harper are doing so good, as always :) Excelling in school,
   enjoying their childhood to the fullest extent. Carson is playing
   tackle football this fall which I'm nervous about, and Harp decided not
   to and wants to take hip hop dance classes...we are signing him up for
   summer classes which will be so much fun to watch! :)
   They sat on our front steps and waited all week for the ice cream truck
   to come by...he finally came by while they were outside and were just
   SO excited!
   [11251829_1102617609765273_562866486_n.jpg]
   Well that is definitely all for now...longest post for me in a while
   and it only took a week to type up, ha!
