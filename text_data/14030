   Stamp With Peggy

Wrapped in Plaid Circle of Trees

   1

   I absolutely love the Wrapped in Plaid Designer Paper and the Perfectly
   Plaid Stamp Set and Punch.  I had a blast designing these cards.  My
   sister, Tina Rappe, used this layout recently and I love the look so I
   cased it for my class.

   Don’t you love the designer paper trees — they give the card a fun
   whimsical look.  The Winter Knit 3-D Embossing Folder adds some great
   texture to the card along with the Cherry Cobbler Diagonal Stripe
   Ribbon.

   I know the calendar just turned to October but I’ve been busy designed

   dresses I had when I was young — I just love them.

Come to Gather Framed Art

   0

   I did a little teasing on Facebook this past week about a project I was
   working on.  The posts definitely peaked interest so I thought it was
   time to share the project with everyone.

   I love making framed art projects.  I saw a few pictures of framed art
   that others were making using the Come to Gather Bundle and I knew that
   was my next piece of art.  The Come to Gather Designer Paper is
   gorgeous and the color combo is fabulous — Pretty Peacock and Cajun
   Craze.  I added Gray Granite as my neutral color and it turned out
   wonderful, if I do say so myself!!

   Come to Gather Suite, Gather Together Stamp Set, Gathered Leaves Dies,
   Come to Gather Designer Paper, 3-D, Framed Art, Fall, Stamp with Peggy
   This was definitely the hit of the night at class.  They were a little
   overwhelmed at first but quickly realized it wasn’t hard but there are
   lots and lots of layers.  It was lots of fun to make and everyone was
   very proud when they finished.  I’m sure I will see some pictures of
   the frames hanging on their walls.

   How would you like to make this framed art picture for yourself.  You
   must have the Come to Gather Bundle (stamp set and dies) plus the stamp
   pads and Stampin’ Blends shown below (no stamping will be done).
   I will cut the pieces and die cut the pieces that are not in the
   Gathered Leaves Dies
   (you have to cut those out yourself).

You have 2 options to get this kit:
1. Purchase the kit (you need an 8″ x 10″ frame – it is not included) — $20
2. Get the kit FREE when you place a $75 order with me by Sunday, September
29th.
