Vimeo Cookie Policy

   Last Updated: May 23, 2018

   Vimeo, Inc. ("Vimeo", "we", or "us") uses cookies and similar tracking
   technologies on Vimeo.com (and related sites), Vimeo-branded
   applications for connected devices ("apps"), and the Vimeo embeddable
   video player. By using our websites, apps, or video player, you consent
   to the placement and use of cookies and similar technologies on your
   device. This Cookie Policy forms part of the Vimeo Privacy Policy.

Cookie Basics

   A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that
   allows Vimeo or a third party to recognize you using a unique
   identifier.

   Who sets them: First-party cookies are set by Vimeo. Third-party
   cookies are set by companies other than Vimeo, such as analytics
   providers and advertisers.

   What they do: "Essential" cookies enable services we offer.
   "Non-essential" cookies help us understand how our services are being
   used (i.e., analytics) and deliver advertisements. Some cookies may
   track you across multiple websites you visit (including ones not
   operated by us) to help deliver advertisements that may be relevant to
   you.

   How long they last: Cookies may be either "session" or "persistent." A
   session cookie expires (i.e., is deleted) when you close your browser.
   A persistent cookie remains until it expires or you delete the cookies
   via your browser settings. Expiration dates are set in the cookies
   themselves and may vary in length, depending on the purpose of the
   cookie.

Cookies Found on Vimeo Service

   We use all types of cookies in our web-based services.

   Vimeo websites: When you visit a Vimeo website, Vimeo and third parties
   will set cookies in your browser. Vimeo sets essential cookies to
   enable certain features and remember your preferences. For example,
   cookies keep you logged in, allow you to purchase items, and maintain
   your language and volume settings. Third parties set cookies for both
   essential and non-essential purposes including analytics (e.g., Google
   Analytics) and advertising (e.g., Google DoubleClick for Publishers).

   Vimeo video player: Vimeo’s embeddable video player uses first-party
   cookies that we consider essential to the video player experience. We
   do not use third-party analytics or advertising cookies when our video
   player appears on a third-party website. Please note that a third-party
   website may place cookies of its own. We have no control over
   third-party websites or the cookies they set.

Changing Your Cookie Preferences

   You may limit the cookies set in your browser by taking the steps
   described below. Note that declining cookies may impact your ability to
   use our services.

   Browser settings: You may change your browser’s settings to delete
   cookies that have already been set and to reject new cookies. To learn
   more, visit the help pages of your browser:
     * Firefox
     * Chrome
     * Safari
     * Microsoft Edge
     * Internet Explorer

   You may also visit our sites in your browser’s "private" or "incognito"
   mode, in which case cookies will be set, but deleted when you close
   browser.

   Opt-out (EU users): Users from the EU may opt out of non-essential
   cookies by selecting the option below or changing their cookie
   preferences in their account settings (registered users only). Upon
   opting out, we will, to the extent possible, delete any non-essential
   first-party cookies in your browser and remember your cookie preference
   for your next visit. Please review your browser settings to remove
   third-party cookies.

   Third party advertising opt-outs: Certain third parties provide ways to
   opt out of advertising cookies across multiple sites. You can learn
   more by visiting the sites of the Network Advertising Initiative
   (https://optout.networkadvertising.org) or the Digital Advertising
   Alliance (https://www.aboutads.info). In addition, there are third
   party plug-ins and apps that help manage cookies.

   Google cookies: Google provides ways to manage or opt out certain of
   its advertising cookies (https://adssettings.google.com) and analytics
   cookies (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You may read
   Google’s Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

Similar Technologies

   We use technologies that resemble cookies to help track user activities
   and preferences. For example, we may use web beacons (tiny graphics
   with a unique identifier embedded on web pages or emails) to track your
   activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web
   beacons used on webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of
   the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in
   emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only.

Mobile Apps

   Our apps (e.g., for iOS, tvOS, Android, and Roku) do not use cookies,
   but may use tracking technologies to, for example, authenticate you as
   a registered user, allow you to use the app’s features, and help us
   understand how our apps are being used. You cannot opt out of these
   mobile tracking technologies, but you may delete your apps and use the
   web versions of our services instead.

   [X] I agree to non-essential cookies.

Vimeo Cookie Policy

   Last Updated: May 23, 2018

   Vimeo, Inc. ("Vimeo", "we", or "us") uses cookies and similar tracking
   technologies on Vimeo.com (and related sites), Vimeo-branded
   applications for connected devices ("apps"), and the Vimeo embeddable
   video player. By using our websites, apps, or video player, you consent
   to the placement and use of cookies and similar technologies on your
   device. This Cookie Policy forms part of the Vimeo Privacy Policy.

Cookie Basics

   A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that
   allows Vimeo or a third party to recognize you using a unique
   identifier.

   Who sets them: First-party cookies are set by Vimeo. Third-party
   cookies are set by companies other than Vimeo, such as analytics
   providers and advertisers.

   What they do: "Essential" cookies enable services we offer.
   "Non-essential" cookies help us understand how our services are being
   used (i.e., analytics) and deliver advertisements. Some cookies may
   track you across multiple websites you visit (including ones not
   operated by us) to help deliver advertisements that may be relevant to
   you.

   How long they last: Cookies may be either "session" or "persistent." A
   session cookie expires (i.e., is deleted) when you close your browser.
   A persistent cookie remains until it expires or you delete the cookies
   via your browser settings. Expiration dates are set in the cookies
   themselves and may vary in length, depending on the purpose of the
   cookie.

Cookies Found on Vimeo Service

   We use all types of cookies in our web-based services.

   Vimeo websites: When you visit a Vimeo website, Vimeo and third parties
   will set cookies in your browser. Vimeo sets essential cookies to
   enable certain features and remember your preferences. For example,
   cookies keep you logged in, allow you to purchase items, and maintain
   your language and volume settings. Third parties set cookies for both
   essential and non-essential purposes including analytics (e.g., Google
   Analytics) and advertising (e.g., Google DoubleClick for Publishers).

   Vimeo video player: Vimeo’s embeddable video player uses first-party
   cookies that we consider essential to the video player experience. We
   do not use third-party analytics or advertising cookies when our video
   player appears on a third-party website. Please note that a third-party
   website may place cookies of its own. We have no control over
   third-party websites or the cookies they set.

Changing Your Cookie Preferences

   You may limit the cookies set in your browser by taking the steps
   described below. Note that declining cookies may impact your ability to
   use our services.

   Browser settings: You may change your browser’s settings to delete
   cookies that have already been set and to reject new cookies. To learn
   more, visit the help pages of your browser:
     * Firefox
     * Chrome
     * Safari
     * Microsoft Edge
     * Internet Explorer

   You may also visit our sites in your browser’s "private" or "incognito"
   mode, in which case cookies will be set, but deleted when you close
   browser.

   Opt-out (EU users): Users from the EU may opt out of non-essential
   cookies by selecting the option below or changing their cookie
   preferences in their account settings (registered users only). Upon
   opting out, we will, to the extent possible, delete any non-essential
   first-party cookies in your browser and remember your cookie preference
   for your next visit. Please review your browser settings to remove
   third-party cookies.

   Third party advertising opt-outs: Certain third parties provide ways to
   opt out of advertising cookies across multiple sites. You can learn
   more by visiting the sites of the Network Advertising Initiative
   (https://optout.networkadvertising.org) or the Digital Advertising
   Alliance (https://www.aboutads.info). In addition, there are third
   party plug-ins and apps that help manage cookies.

   Google cookies: Google provides ways to manage or opt out certain of
   its advertising cookies (https://adssettings.google.com) and analytics
   cookies (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You may read
   Google’s Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

Similar Technologies

   We use technologies that resemble cookies to help track user activities
   and preferences. For example, we may use web beacons (tiny graphics
   with a unique identifier embedded on web pages or emails) to track your
   activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web
   beacons used on webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of
   the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in
   emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only.

Mobile Apps

   Our apps (e.g., for iOS, tvOS, Android, and Roku) do not use cookies,
   but may use tracking technologies to, for example, authenticate you as
   a registered user, allow you to use the app’s features, and help us
   understand how our apps are being used. You cannot opt out of these
   mobile tracking technologies, but you may delete your apps and use the
   web versions of our services instead.

   [X] I agree to non-essential cookies.
