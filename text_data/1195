Introduction (Back to Top)

   The Hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules (Linnaeus), is a dynastine
   scarab beetle in the family Scarabaeidae. Some of the more recognizable
   beetles in the subfamily Dynastinae have males that possess thoracic
   and/or cephalic horns (Figures 1 and 2). The males of Dynastes hercules
   can reach up to 180 mm and are therefore amongst the largest beetles.
   Females are dark in color and do not have horns (Figure 3). Adults are
   crepuscular or nocturnal fliers and their peak activity is just before
   daybreak (Ratcliffe et al. 2013, Ratcliffe and Cave 2015). Ratcliffe
   and Cave (2013, 2015) mentioned that most specimens are captured at
   light traps between 3:00 and 5:00 AM.

Taxonomy (Back to Top)

   The genus Dynastes MacLeay consists of seven species. The other species
   in the genus are distributed throughout southern North America
   (Dynastes tityus (Linnaeus) and Dynastes grantii Horn), Mesoamerica
   (Dynastes hyllus Chevrolat and Dynastes maya Hardy), and South America
   (Dynastes neptunus Quensel and Dynastes satanus Moser) (Endrödi 1976,
   Endrödi 1985, Hardy 2003). The status of the taxonomy of Dynastes
   hercules is uncertain (Ratcliffe et al. 2013), and different treatments
   can be found throughout the literature (Ratcliffe 2003, Ratcliffe and
   Cave 2006, Dutrillaux and Dutrillaux 2013, Ratcliffe et al. 2013, Huang
   2014). Three subspecies are recognized: Dynastes hercules hercules
   (Linnaeus) (Guadeloupe and Dominica), Dynastes hercules reidi Chalumeau
   (Martinique and St. Lucia), and Dynastes hercules septentrionalis
   Lachaume (Mesoamerica) (Ratcliffe et al. 2013, Ratcliffe and Cave
   2015). The status of the South American subspecies is uncertain, and
   more research is needed to solve this taxonomic uncertainty (Ratcliffe
   2003, Ratcliffe and Cave 2006, Ratcliffe et al. 2013, Ratcliffe and
   Cave 2015). A recent study using multiple data types suggests that
   several subspecies deserve species status (Huang and Knowles 2015).

Distribution (Back to Top)

   The Hercules beetle can be found from southern Mexico south to Bolivia,
   and in the Lesser Antilles (Ratcliffe 2003, Ratcliffe and Cave 2006).
   Populations of Dynastes hercules can be found in pockets of montane and
   lowland rainforest in Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru (Figure 4)
   (Rassart et al. 2008, Dutrillaux and Dutrillaux 2013).

Description (Back to Top)

   Adults vary in size between 50–85 mm long and 29–42 mm wide. The body
   of males (Figures 1 and 2) is black with the exception of the elytra,
   which can have shades of olive and have a black suture with sparsely
   distributed black spots (Ratcliffe 2003, Ratcliffe and Cave 2006,
   Ratcliffe et al. 2013). The coloration of males can also change
   depending on humidity, with increasing humidity causing the elytra to
   turn black (Hinton and Jarman 1973). The coarsely punctured elytra of
   females (Figure 3) are usually entirely black but sometimes have the
   last quarter similarly colored as in males (Ratcliffe 2003, Ratcliffe
   and Cave 2006, Ratcliffe et al. 2013). Males possess thoracic and
   cephalic horns, which are lacking in females (Figure 1 and 3). Body
   size, large horn size, and coloration make male Dynastes hercules easy
   to distinguish from other Dynastes species.

Life Cycle (Back to Top)

   Dynastes hercules undergoes complete metamorphosis. Not much is known
   about the life cycle of Dynastes hercules in the wild, but numerous
   scientists and breeders have observed the life cycle under laboratory
   conditions. The egg has an average incubation period of 27.7 days,
   followed by three instars (Figure 5), which on average complete
   development in 50 days (first instar), 56 days (second instar), and 450
   days (third instar) at 25±1°C (Gruner and Chalumeau 1977). The pupal
   stage (Figure 6) lasts about 32 days, while adults (Figures 1, 2, and
   3) can live three to six months in captivity. The total time for
   complete development ranges 19–21 months, and the total life span can
   be up to two years (Gruner and Chalumeau 1977).

Diet (Back to Top)

   The larvae of Dynastes hercules are saproxylophagous (feeding on dead
   wood) and develop in rotten logs and decaying tree trunks (Ratcliffe
   2003, Ratcliffe and Cave 2006, Ratcliffe et al. 2013). Larvae have been
   observed in trunks of Chrysobalanaceae (Licania ternatensis Hook. f. ex
   Duss), Phyllanthaceae (Amanoa caribaea Krug & Urb.), and Fabaceae (Inga
   ingoides (Rich.) Willd.) (Gruner and Chalumeau 1977). Adults generally
   feed on rotting fruit that has fallen to the ground (Rassart et al.
   2008) and have been observed feeding for up to 24 hours without a
   break, under laboratory conditions (Beebe 1944).

Importance (Back to Top)

   Dynastes hercules beetles have been used as a model to study sexual
   selection due to the large horns the males use as weaponry (Beebe 1947,
   McCullough et al. 2014). McCullough et al. (2014) compared the fighting
   style of Dynastes hercules with pliers, where the horns are used to
   squeeze and lift the opponent and subsequently toss him to the ground.
   These fights usually occur to gain access to females, but horn size is
   not important to females for their choice of mates (McCullough et al.
   2014). Adult males continue to battle until one opponent either
   helplessly lands on its back, is injured, or retreats (Beebe 1944).

   The larvae of Dynastes hercules have an important ecological role due
   to their saproxylophagous life style. They help with nutrient cycling
   as well as biodegradation. Lately, the rearing of large specimens of
   Dynastes hercules has become more popular, and breeders try to rear
   individuals with large body and horn sizes by providing them with
   optimal nutrition and conditions. Sales of large laboratory-reared
   specimens of Dynastes hercules can result in prices upwards of $400.
