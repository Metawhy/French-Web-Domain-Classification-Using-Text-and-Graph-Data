   products, applicable to the orders of customers via its website
   www.marinmontagut.com.

   Preamble

   The client and Marin Montagut Production agree that their commercial
   relations will be governed exclusively by these general conditions of
   sale. Marin Montagut Production reserves the right to modify its
   general conditions of sale at any time by publishing a new version on
   the site. The general conditions of sale applicable to each order are
   those available on the date of their validation on the Site. This site
   is built using Squarespace and uses Squarespace's trade function to
   record and process orders. The payment processing system on this site
   is run using Stripe.

   Article 1. - General provision

   Marin Montagut Production makes sure that the acceptance of its general
   conditions of sale is clear by ticking a box and a validation click for
   each transaction. Thus, the customer declares having read and
   understood these general conditions of sale and accept them without
   restriction and without reservation.

   The client acknowledges having access to the advice and information
   necessary to ensure that the offer meets his needs. The customer
   declares that he can legally place orders or represent the legal entity
   for which he exercises it. Unless proved otherwise, the information
   recorded by the seller constitutes proof of all the transactional
   elements.

   These general conditions of sale apply to orders placed for delivery in
   France or abroad.

   Article 2. - Start date and duration

   These general conditions of sale are applicable to the parties at the
   date of validation of the order. The present general conditions of sale
   are applicable for the duration necessary to the execution of the

   of the products ordered. When performing the above steps to complete
   the order, the customer agrees to comply with these terms and
   conditions of sale. In accordance with Article L. 122-1 of the Consumer
   Code, Marin Montagut Production reserves the right to refuse the order
   if it seems abnormal (especially considering the quantities ordered),
   passed in bad faith or for any other reason, and in particular if there
   is a dispute with the customer regarding the payment of a previous
   order.

   Article 4. - Product prices and conditions of validity

   The price of products sold on the site is indicated by article and by
   reference, except typographical error. These prices include the VAT
   applicable on the day of the order for the orders to be shipped in EU
   but do not include the delivery costs which will be invoiced in
   addition as specified to the customer during the validation of his
   order.

   Customs duties or other local taxes or import duties or state taxes may
   be required in some cases. These rights and sums are not the
   responsibility of the seller. They will be at the expense and under the
   responsibility of the customer. The seller invites the customer to
   inquire about these aspects with the corresponding local authorities.

   At the time of the validation of the order, the price to be paid
   corresponds to the total amount of the order. The products and their
   prices are valid as long as they are accessible on the site within the
   limits of available stocks.

   As such, indications on the availability of products may be provided to
   the customer at the time of placing the order. Errors or modifications
   may exceptionally exist. In case of unavailability of a product after
   validation of the order by the customer, Marin Montagut Production will
   inform the customer by e-mail as soon as possible, proposing either to
   order in replacement another article presented on the site, either of
   'cancel the order. If the customer chooses to cancel the order, the
   refund will be made no later than 14 days after the payment if the
   customer's bank account has been debited.

   Marin Montagut Production reserves the right to modify the lists of
   products and / or prices offered on the site at any time and without
   notice, it being specified that those available at the time of the
   order will be those accepted by the customer by confirming them.

   The customer is duly informed that the illustrations, the photographs
   and the description of the products are only indicative and do not
   enter the contractual field. Marin Montagut Production can not be held
   responsible for any error or inaccuracy whatsoever.

   Article 5. - Terms of payment

   Payment is due immediately at the time of the order. The customer will
   make his payment by credit card. The payment of the amount of the order
   will be made exclusively by one of the following payment methods: Visa,
   Mastercard, American Express or Apple Pay. Payments by check and bank

   Once the payment made by the customer, the amount is immediately
   debited after verification of this information. In accordance with
   Article L.132-2 of the Monetary and Financial Code, the commitment to
   pay by card is irrevocable as soon as it is activated.

   By providing credit card information, the customer authorizes Marin
   Montagut Production to debit his credit card the total amount of the
   order. The customer confirms that he is the holder of the credit card
   to be debited and that the name on the card is his. The customer
   communicates the sixteen digits and the expiry date of his credit card
   and, where applicable, the numbers of the visual cryptogram. If the
   debit could not be confirmed, the transaction would be canceled
   immediately and the order canceled.

   The occurrence of an unpaid amount due to fraudulent use of a credit
   card will result in the registration of the information associated with
   this failure with an incident payment file implemented by a third party
   organization.

   Article 6. - Delivery of the order

   The products are delivered to the delivery address which is indicated
   at the time of the order. The customer is solely responsible for a lack
   of delivery due to a lack or error of geographical indication.

   The amount of shipping costs depends on the amount and nature of the
   order. In any case, the amount of these costs is indicated to the
   customer before the validation of the order.

   The method of delivery is specified to the customer throughout the
   process of validation and payment of the order. The delivery time will
   depend on the final delivery method.

   Delivery times run from the date of confirmation of the order by Marin
   Montagut Production according to the average time of preparation and
   delivery of the order.

   Delivery times are given as an indication and are deemed to have been
   respected by Marin Montagut Production when the first presentation of
   the order to the address indicated by the customer took place within
   the time indicated to him.

   In case of late delivery, the customer has the option to terminate the
   contract under the terms defined in Article L138-2 of the Consumer
   Code. The seller then proceeds to the refund of the product under the
   conditions of Article L138-3 of the Consumer Code. The seller makes
   available a contact address which is specified in the order
   confirmation mail which allows its follow-up. The seller reminds that
   when the customer physically takes possession of his order, the risk of
   loss or deterioration of the products is transferred to him. It is
   therefore up to the customer to inform the carrier of any reservations
   on the delivered product. The customer is required to check the
   condition of the packaging and the items on delivery. It is up to the

   with acknowledgment of receipt within three working days, holidays,
   from the date of delivery of the products.

   Production. The absence of claim within the aforementioned period
   extinguishes any action against the carrier in accordance with Article
   L. 133-3 of the Commercial Code.

   If the packaging is in good condition but the product is damaged when
   it is opened, it is up to the customer to send it back to Marin
   Montagut Production under the conditions described below for expertise.

   remaining the responsibility of the customer.

   Article 7. Return Policy

   In accordance with Article L.121-20 of the Consumer Code, "the consumer
