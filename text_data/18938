Thanks You

   Unforgettable Adventure: “On one of my trips of safari I was with
   clients and during our game drive in Ngorongoro we came across a rhino
   who had just given birth to a baby rhino and this baby rhino was
   actually stuck in a muddy swamp and was suffocating…. and at that
   moment the rhino mother was too weak to help it out therefore I radio
   called the rangers to come and rescue the baby rhino.”
