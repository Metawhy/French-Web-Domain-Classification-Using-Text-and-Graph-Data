I am VP of Data Science at Jobandtalent and Research Collaborator in the Web
Research Group at UPF.

   Previous experiences: STUART, YAHOO LABS, TWITTER and IRISA/INRIA.

   My background includes Predictive Models, Data Mining, Information
   Retrieval, Machine Learning, User Modeling, Recommendation Systems and
   Online Computational Advertising. Recently I'm getting more interested
   in the Discrete Optimization problems.

   I have worked with many different large data collections such as
   Flickr, Yahoo News, Yahoo query- and web-logs, and as well on Twitter
   data.

   I have also done various researches on credit card user's transactions,
   Sentiment Analysis with Yahoo and Yelp data, and geographic
   localization of images and videos.

   I am a Mac/Unix user, and my specialties are Apache Hadoop/PIG, Java,
   Python and R.

Challenges

BBVA Innova Challenge

   I participated with Luca Chiarandini at the Innova Challenge, the first
   time the bank has opened his real trade data for a challenge. We
   participated in two of the three categories.
   Qkly

   Qkly - Winner of the First Edition Innova Challenge Big Data by BBVA
   Bank

   “Application for Customers” category, December 2013.

What is it?

   How many times did you get stuck in the queue at a supermarket or at a
   grocery store? How do you feel to go shopping during the sales period?
   And when you're visiting some attractions or museums? Have you ever
   wondered if there is a way in which you could have avoided it?

   Qkly automatically produces optimized schedules of all the business,
   attractions, or places based on your preferences. Using historical data
   provided by the BBVA Open API, Qkly is able to estimate how crowded a
   place is at a certain time. Based on this information, it helps you to
   pick the time in which less people are present, so as to save time and
   avoid stress.

   Quartz - 2nd Winner of the First Edition Innova Challenge Big Data by
   BBVA Bank

   ““Visualization”” category, December 2013.

The Interface

   Quartz allows you to explore how people spend their money. The pie
   charts on the map represent the amount of money spent by people at a
   particular location, split by customer gender or business category.

The Filtering

   The legend on the bottom right corner allows you to filter out genders
   or categories you are not interested in.

The Quartz Wheel

   If you want more information, you can click on a pie chart to open the
   Quartz Wheel. If you move the mouse on a segment of the wheel, you can
   see the number of payments in the center. Also, you can see additional
   segments on the wheel representing how the payments in the category
   distribute in sub-segments. If you move from a segment to one of its
   sub-segment, you will see the percentage of payments in the segment
   which refer to it, as well as the percentage on the total amount for
   the location.
