So much support

   Pioneers of Spaceflight Cover

   It‚Äôs now a little over a month ago, we released our new album ‚ÄúPioneers
   of Spaceflight‚Äù and we‚Äôre so happy to see the enormous amount of
   support we have got from people, magazines, blogs & webzines all over
   the world. Reviews and kind words from denmark, all the way to
   australia, taiwan and japan, cross the globe to US, canada and mexico,
   and then almost every european country have been represented with
   feedback to ‚ÄúPioneers of Spaceflight‚Äù

   Just take a look at some of the latest :

   ‚Äúthe end product is most definitely imbued with a wonderfully organic
   flow, as if it was grown from the ground itself.‚Äù -> The New Review

   ‚Äúen aggressiv men behagelig rejse gennem et flydende guitarmekka‚Äù ->
   Undertoner ( danish webzine )

   ‚ÄúI would rank this fairly close to Caspian in terms of creating a mood,
   painting a soundscape, and throwing the audience into it‚Äù -> To Eleven

   ‚ÄúAusladene Klangf√§chen, Gitarrenreverbs, Sehnsuchtsmelodien, pures
   musikalisches Schwelgen mit offenem Ende ‚Äì und ohne Gesang.Ausladene
   Klangf√§chen, Gitarrenreverbs, Sehnsuchtsmelodien, pures musikalisches
   Schwelgen mit offenem Ende ‚Äì und ohne Gesang.‚Äù -> Mescaline Injection (
   german webzine )

   ‚ÄúMa questo approccio eclettico consente alla band di evitare pesantezza
   e monotonia e i rischi di cerebralismo. Un nome che, fra gli altri,
   potremmo affiancare a quello dei danesi √® quello degli americani
   Explosion In The Sky.‚Äù -> Distorsioni ( italian webzine )

   And this is just the latest, take a look at our press page to see a lot
   more links to reviews and words.

   Not only forums, blogs & reviews have been around, we have a lot of
   people listening to the album at soundcloud, we have sold a whole lot
   of physical CD‚Äôs ( you can get your own copy at
   latenightventure.bandcamp.com ), there‚Äôs tremendous support at our
   youtube channel, where all songs from Pioneers of Spaceflight will be
   available over time and we have had a lot of support on our facebook
   and vk.

   At the moment we‚Äôre planning tours in denmark and europe, just in the
   beginning of the new year, but hope to expand our horizons even more.

   Thanks a lot to everyone that has been supporting the new album so
   much.

What a week

   Approx one week ago we drove our cool blue Mercedes Sprinter south, to
   play shows in Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium and France.

   What a week. One nice show after each other, lots of enthusiastic
   audience, loads of CD‚Äôs, Vinyl and T-Shirts handed over and just a good
   time with people at all the venues, including the staff and the other
   bands ( The Netherlands in the netherlands are to be recommended for
   their hand played post-prog-kraut-electro-rock üôÇ ). Welcoming food,
   perfect hospitality, a few beers and a tour Ardbeg, made everything as
   good as it gets. Even a broken down tour bus was handled and we could
   get to our gigs in time.

   Not only did we have a great time at each and every show, there were
   also happening a lot on the net meanwhile, in that week. One after the
   other good reviews came dropping in with words like :
     * ‚Äúa huge 10 track 57 minute post-rock goliath. Sonically the album
       is as rock solid as it gets and is a great example of solid
       layering depth and sound staging.‚Äù ‚Äì Courtesy of Postrockstar (
       read the full review here )
     * ‚ÄúThey have the tunes right from the universe. On Pioneers Of
       Spaceflight the band captured the melancholy and dreaminess, the
       darkness and the never-ending light, the most in-depth questions
       about the universe and the ultimate freedom ‚Äì of the universe.‚Äù ‚Äì
       Courtesy of Nothing But Hope And Passion ( read the full review
       here )
     * ‚ÄúThe combination of fully instrumental tracks (which are the best
       tracks on the album) and vocal-featured tracks, make this a great
       sounding and diverse album.‚Äù ‚Äì Courtesy of Postrocker.nl (read the
       full review here)
     * ‚ÄúPrepare yourself to be weightless and aim at another place. Close
       your eyes, press ‚Äòplay‚Äò.. welcome aboard‚Äù  ‚Äì Translated from danish

   Not only these fine words, have been published, there‚Äôs been so much
   support from a lot of other blogs, webzines, tweets, facebook and radio
   stations, thank you everyone for your support.

   We have a lot of footage and pictures from the tour that will be looked
   through and hopefully find it‚Äôs way to the net, and at the moment we
   are putting together videos for 2 more songs from the album, and rest
   to come.

   If you wanna take a listen or maybe even buy a copy of ‚ÄúPioneers of
   Spaceflight‚Äù ‚Äì you can head over to our Bandcamp :
   latenightventure.bandcamp.com and order one. There‚Äôs even a signed copy
   option üôÇ

   NB: The picture here in this post is taken in Leipzig at Georg Schwarz
   Strasse, in a condemned building just above the venue we played there.
   We thought it was pretty cool with the totally empty house and then
   with this room filled up with posters of Sisters of Mercy, Fields of
   the nephilim, The Cure & Joy Division, 80s new wave heroes.
