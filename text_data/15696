Digital Privacy is a Civil Right

   7 Replies

   There has been a lot of talk in the news about the weaponization of
   social media. What is often not discussed in these arguments is the
   interconnectedness of social media and digital, data privacy. While a
   great deal of attention has been paid to hacked and/or misused
   information (such as the Cambridge Analytica fiasco), the issues with
   digital privacy are much deeper than the lack of accountability by
   Facebook or Twitter.

   security-1202344_1280

   Even with all of the ink (digital and analogue) spilt on the topic,
   most individuals do not understand what data privacy is, why it’s
   important, or how it is used. The reality is that laws and regulations
   have not kept up with the rapid influx of computing devices and
   interconnected experiences in the world. As such, our information is
   out there – available to the world in never before seen ways, with
   unprecedented access and consequences. And social media (where some
   people argue you offer up your information freely) is not the sole
   bastion of privacy invasion. Internet search histories in your own
   home, household shopping tied to rewards or even credit cards, email
   exchanges, browser history, even parking data all fall into this realm
   of unprotected data privacy. Even more disturbing is that many of us
   (and our children) have smartphones which have become a portable GPS,
   telling our apps (and whoever they grant access to) a history of our
   daily travels.

   Because we have virtually no regulations on how these firms collect,
   use, and share our data, digital privacy has become practically
   non-existent in the United States. The consequences for this are quite
   dire. For example, because we have no data privacy, it has given
   hostile, foreign governments an insight into our collective psyche and
   an avenue to sew greater decent. While Russian election meddling news
   coverage largely focused on conservative and right wing voters, the
   Russian governments insidious methods also focused on people of color.
   A report recently issued to the United States senate reported that
   Russian bots specifically targeted African Americans on Facebook and
   Twitter; the likely result was lower voter turnout and stoking of
   racial tensions and divisions in the United States.

   Congress has failed to educate itself on how the internet and computing
   tools work, highlighted in their interviews of Facebook founder Mark
   Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. While coverage (and internet
   memes) focused on how clueless law makers are about “how the internet
   and technology work,” the real concern here should be how little
   congress has invested in learning about these tools and thus
   instituting effective protections for their constituents.

   While there has been some focus on data privacy, the small and
   attainable semblances of it are still reserved for those who can pay.
   Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, was lauded for his speech in Brussels in which
   he lambasted his fellow Silicon Valley technologists for their lack of
   concern over privacy and highlighted that Apple does not participate in
   data mining and distribution. However, Apple products cost a premium
   for their users (often 20-30% above their competitors), reserving
   Apples protections for those who can afford to pay.

   This is not the bastion of only online tools and hardware. In my city
   of Miami, the Miami Parking Authority has just announced that they will
   be raising parking rates for non Miami-Dade residents starting January
   1. Residents will receive a discount if they register with the Park
   Mobile app. While this may seem benign, a little digging demonstrates
   that the only individuals able to register with the park mobile app
   must have a smartphone and a debit or credit card, meaning that it will
   cost a premium for the county’s poorest residents. Additionally, Park
   Mobile is not a government app. Rather, it is owned and operated by the
   BMW Group (the largest car manufacturer  in the world). This means that
   unless users are okay with handing over their name, address, license
   plate number (tied to their vehicle), and credit card along with their
   data privacy for where they go and where they park (along with
   geo-location which is enabled on the app) to a for-profit car
   manufacturer, they will also pay 20% or more for parking in the city of
   Miami.

   The reality is, we live in a hybrid, digital-analogue world and these
   services are no longer “optional” for operating in it. Going without a
   smartphone and/or internet use is akin to “dropping of the grid” and
   makes day to day activities such as: getting work done, parking,
   depositing checks, and other routine actions all the more difficult,
   time consuming, and more expensive (or even impossible). Data privacy
   is more crucial than ever. We cannot rely on these companies to
   regulate themselves. In fact, they have proven that they will spend
   millions of dollars to prevent just that. The New York Times did an
   amazing (and disturbing) expose on Facebook’s role in Russian
   interference in the 2016 election and its ongoing attempts to cover up
   their own culpability.

   While the United States has been slow to act, other than with some
   limitedly enforced laws relating to children’s data (see COPPA and
   FERPA), Europe has started to address this issue with a heavy hand. The
   much publicized GDPR initiative in the EU has removed the physical
   barriers tied to data lies and recognizes that data storage and
   transition operates on a global scale. It allows users to better manage
   their online privacy. The United States, however, has been slow to
   regulate and adopt. This has in part has been hampered by a lack of
   understanding of this issue on Capital Hill coupled with powerful
   lobbying by digital giants such as Facebook and Google. However, we
   need to do more. This issue will continue to expand and creep into our
   lives until it is omnipresent. If our representatives won’t address
   data privacy, then we as constituents must force their hands.
   California passed a sweeping digital privacy law just this year, it is
   time for other states and lawmakers to follow suit. Digital privacy is
   not a partisan issue, it’s an American one.

5 Gifts for Teachers that are not Starbucks Gift Cards

   1 Reply

   It’s Teacher Appreciation Week and pushing the end of the school year;
   amid the excitement and final exams, many people are thinking about
   what to give their own teachers or those educating their children. Now,
   first and foremost, as a teacher I must say that we do not expect or
   demand gives from our students or student’s parents. When we do get
   them, we are quite touched. That being said, I’m often asked by friends
   and families what to get the teachers in their life that aren’t just
   “another Starbucks giftcard!” Don’t get me wrong, Starbucks gift cards
   have fed my caffeine habit for many years, but I realize that some want
   to be a little more personal in their gift giving. Here are a few ideas
   for gifts for the teacher in your life.

Books

   Educators love to read! If your student is in a subject specific class
   (think science or history), a book on that topic is great. As a US
   History teacher, my students have kept me in David McCullough books for
   years and I love them. If you need a little inspiration, try the New
   York Times Best Seller list. If you know the teacher has an eReader and
   you have a little extra change to throw around, consider a Kindle
   Unlimited gift subscription.

Gourmet Coffee

   Instead of the Starbucks gift card, if you know you have a coffee
   drinker, consider a nice coffee mug (even one personalized by your
   child) and an assortment of gourmet coffees. I got this one year and it
   was fantastic! I was pretty upset the year the mug broke.

Event Tickets/Passes

   These can be surprisingly inexpensive and lovely personal gift for a
   teacher. Are they a coach? What about tickets to the local professional
   or college game? Music teacher? Tickets to the local symphony. Annual
   passes to local art, science, and history museums also make a great
   gift. Even passes to go to a movie are a wonderful treat for an
   educator; you can often pick these up on a discount at Costco or the
   movie theater itself. If you have a few extra dollars, consider giving
   them a MoviePass gift subscription. These gifts show the teacher that
   you know they need some well deserved leisure time.

Extra School Supplies

   This one may seem boring, but trust me it’s one of the best gifts you
   can give. Educators often buy school supplies out of their own pockets.
   Over the summer, they will be stocking up. Sending in extra reams of
   paper, pencils, pens, tissues, and whatever else was on that “back to
   school” supply list you got in the fall will be valued you like gold.
   You’ll be saving your teacher’s pocket book and brightening the
   learning experience for others next year.

A Hand Written Note

   I cannot stress this one enough. The most thoughtful and treasured
   gifts I have received from students were thoughtful, hand written
   notes. I keep them in a drawer and pull them out to read periodically.
   If your child is old enough to write, ask them to list two to three
   things they really enjoy about the teacher’s class and what they have
   learned. Trust me, long after your gift has been forgotten, this one
   will be treasured.

   I hope that you and your have a wonderful holiday season! To the other
   educator’s out there, finish strong!

Learn to Spot Fake News by Creating It (In a Game)

   Leave a reply

   badnews-tablet-intro.png Fake News, disinformation, and conspiracy
   theories are not just the subject of political investigations and
   Sunday night commentaries, but there are a legitimate concern for those
   who need to teach digital and media literacies. To that end, a
   developer has created a free online game called Bad News.

   According to its creators:

     The Bad News Game confers resistance against disinformation by
     putting players in
     the position of the people who create it, and as such gain insight
     into the various
     tactics and methods used by ‘real’ fake news-mongers to spread their
     message.
     This, in turn, builds up resistance.

   They have also created an Educator sheet to help teachers and
   specialist employ the game and teaching digital media literacy skills
   at their institutions.

How & Why to Report a Post on Social Media

   2 Replies

   A few weeks ago, I wrote a response to the political activation of the
   Parkland students entitled “Don’t Call Them the Selfie Generation!” The
   March for our Lives movement, along with other topics in the news, have
   highlighted that Social Media is powerful and impactful in the modern
   world. It has been especially potent in the hands of young people, as
   we have seen with the latest political movements surrounding school
   shootings. JSTOR recently posted an article highlighting “What Parkland
   Tells us About Teens and Social Media.”

   As the story continues, and we are closer to the March 24th March for
   Our Lives in Washington D.C., I have been following the voices of these
   students who continue to talk and speak up in spite of some very real
   consequences like school suspension and targeted harassment from
   anonymous sources and political pundits. When I speak to my own
   students about how I can help empower their voices, they tell me: Let
   US speak; even if you mean well, don’t speak for us. What they want, is
   their voices heard.

   As Twitter (my favorite social media platform) has become the platform
   of choice for this movement, I have started to take a few minutes every
   day to report targeted harassment and threats against these teens and
   others. Twitter has made a concerted effort to stop harassment on their
   platform. However, the human component is an important element for
   success. Therefore, as a means to help amplify their voices and support
   legitimate, challenging conversations on social media, I report bots
   and harassers. It’s pretty easy to do this. Here is a step by step way
   to do just that.

   When you see a posting that issues threats, uses slurs, encourages self
   harm, or is part of a systematic threat system, you can report that
   account and/or that tweet. To do so, Click on the button on the top
   right of the tweet (it looks like a carrot).

   You will then be given the option to report the tweet.

   Twitter allows you to report for a myriad of reasons (spam, harassment,
   etc).

   Twitter allows you to report tweets on behalf of another person (which
   I have been doing).


   You can also include example tweets to support the case.

   Social Media is not going away any time soon. I encourage you to help
   make it a true democratizing place by reporting abuse, threats, bots,
   and spam. Amplify the voices of others by keeping them safe from
   harassment and threats.

Sustainable Innovation in Schools

   Leave a reply

   Innovation…. the cause of and solution to all of our problems, at least
   it is according to every article, book, or keynote speaker in the last
   couple of years. It will reinvent education, but only after it destroys
   the standard schoolhouse. We seem to act as though innovation is a 21st
   century invention. However, education has long been a realm of
   Creativity Technology Innovation Idea Bulb Gears

   dea-Bulb-Gears-1443730

   innovation, from one room school houses, to the standardized classroom,
   to the open classroom; from slate, to paper, to computer; or from
   abacus, to slide ruler, to calculator. The story of modern innovation
   could be told in a classroom. Unfortunately, the word “innovation” has
   been so overused that it risks entering the lexicon of buzzwords. This
   is a shame because innovation has an important and strategic role in
   education.

   I do not mean to diminish the power of innovation but rather the
   contrived manner in which it is applied as a panacea to what ails us.
   Rather than being respectfully regarded as the logical extension of
   inquiry and exploration, it is often viewed as the result of luck or
   happenstance; the deus ex machina of our times. In a realm as important
   and vital as education, this can be problematic or even dangerous
   thinking. For innovation in education to be truly impactful, it must be
   sustainable. To be sustainable, it must be devised thoughtfully and
   applied strategically.

   Innovation, at its heart, addresses a need: productivity, efficiency,
   or opportunity. Innovative practice is one that is methodical and
   incorporates regular feedback. To determine the heart of our innovative
   needs and practice, we must employ a discerning eye for what Heidi
   Hayes Jacobs calls classical vs antiquated educational practices. What
   is classical is timeless and enduring, what is antiquated worked for a
   time, but that time has passed. Let us look at the graphing calculator
   replacing the slide ruler. It allowed students to more readily apply
   higher order mathematical practice in order to quickly and accurately
   solve complex equations. However, any good math teacher will tell you
   that it’s not the calculator alone, but its application and process.
   The tool evolved to fit the modern needs of the skill set. This is why
   calculators have endured, while other “innovations” (like the open
   classroom) have failed. Innovation in schools and classrooms should be
   meaningful, address contemporary challenges, and enrich the learning
   environment. Only by doing this will innovation in schools be
   sustainable and enduring.

Don’t Call Them the Selfie Generation

   6 Replies

   Today I watched several hundred students at my school stand up and walk
   out of class, sit on the football field in a circle, and observe 17
   minutes of silence; one minute for each life stolen in the massacre at
   Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This is one small group out of
   thousands. Students across the United States are taking up political
   action in the wake of the latest mass shooting tragedy.

   I live and work at a school just an hour drive south of Marjory
   Stoneman and the effects of this event have been palpable in our
   community. I have watched students grieve on television and in person.
   I have heard stories of heroic teachers and children that took bullets
   to save others. Even more so, I have watch a generation that has long
   been dismissed and belittled awaken and stand up in a way that my
   generation never did.

   Just after the shooting, we have seen the rise of student leaders from
   the Marjory Stoneman Douglas campus. Emma Gonzalez, a senior in high
   school, emerged as a face of this movement with her shaved head and
   powerful language. Her since viral speech called “BS” on politicians
   and others who fail to take action on gun violence.

   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   And she is not alone. A slew of students have made the rounds on the
   news circuit, bringing their message to forefront: It’s time to address
   gun violence, push back on the money and lobbying of the NRA, and hold
   politicians accountable for the deaths of hundreds at the hands of
   assault-styled weapons. Their movement: #NeverAgain is gaining steam.
   They have raised over 1.2 million on Go Fund Me to support the March
   for Our Lives in Washington DC on March 24. Perhaps most enduring, they
   are inspiring young people to register and vote!

   The backlash against these children has been fast and brutal. More
   mainstream, conservative news anchors have questioned whether or not
   “children” should have a say in policy. Their response? A resounding
   “YES!”
   Capture

   Even more disturbing, just days after surviving a mass shooting, they
   now find themselves the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories
   asserting that they are “actors” or “liberal plants.” In Florida,
   Benjamin Kelly (an aid to Republic Rep Shawn Harris) was recently fired
   after sending messages to the press asserting that two of the students
   were not, in fact, students, but paid “crisis actors.” A statement that
   is not only demonstrably false, but loathsome. In addition to
   perpetuating conspiracy theories, others have taken to social media in
   an attempt to silence these children using threats of violence and
   death.

     Temporarily got off Facebook because there’s no character count so
     the death threats from the @NRA cultists are a bit more graphic than
     those on twitter. Will be back when I have the time for it. Busy
     getting my feelings hurt by fellow teenagers at Br**tb*rt

     — Cameron Kasky (@cameron_kasky) February 21, 2018

   While they make jokes about the insanity of these conspiracies or the
   attacks by the right wing media, the truth is that it takes courage to
   stand up like this. These children, already vulnerable and wounded
   after enduring a horrific event, continue to show grace and courage in
   the face of true adversity. Many of us adults would run and hide at the
   first snide remark towards us on the internet. These kids make jokes!

   I do not know what will happen as a result of this latest shooting. I
   hope that there will be swift and real change to prevent if from
   happening again. However, what I do know, is that this generation just
   showed to the world what I have long argued. They are NOT the selfie
   generation. No. They are a generation of empowered, vocal, informed,
   compassionate, and now ANGRY young adults that are ready to shape the
   world for the better.

The Jobs of Today May Not Exist Tomorrow – How do we Prepare Students?

   1 Reply

   Not long ago, I wrote a blog post entitled: Lifelong Learning is an
   Essential Skill, not a Buzzword. The more I read about
   future-readiness, 21st century skills, job market reports, and advances
   in technology (especially AI), the more I understand this to be true.
   Recently, PEW Research published a report on the Future of Jobs & Job
   Training.
   18732734804_7b3a90ea19_h

   Courtesy of Gerd Leonhard
   https://www.flickr.com/photos/gleonhard/18732734804

   This report reaffirmed the fact that in the near future, millions of
   jobs will be lost to automation and AI that can do these tasks not only
   just as well, but often better than their human counterparts. These are
   not just rudimentary, repeatable tasks, but sophisticated, white-collar
   jobs that have generally been considered “safe” from automation:
   dermatologists, journalists, claims adjusters, financial reporters, and
   more. With the rise of automated driving, millions of workers who rely
   on driving as their means of employment are looking at becoming
   obsolete (long-haul truck drivers, taxi drivers, delivery wo/men, and
   more).

   Pushing aside the very real, and daunting, questions of what this means
   for our job market and even Capitalism, for educators and parents this
   means: how do we prepare students for the stark realities of an ever
   shifting job market? While new technologies may be depleting jobs,
   knowing how to leverage them will become an even more essential skill
   in the future.

     “The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for
     the changing labor market. At the same time, recent IT advances
     offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access
     education.”

   Looking at how and when people learn job skills and other training will
   also need to be examined. Will a traditional high school, college, and
   beyond model remain the default given the rapidly changing employment
   models?

     “A central question about the future, then, is whether formal and
     informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs
     of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the
     future.”

   PEW delves deeply into this topic, asking experts about their vision of
   the future and determined 5 Major Themes:

   Five major themes about the future of jobs training in the tech age

   Considering the uncertainty of the future, what we do know is that we
   must prepare young people to be flexible and agile learners, critical
   thinkers, entrepreneurs and innovators, and to know that they must
   develop a passion and drive for lifelong learning.

   While the article is long, I strongly encourage my readers to check out
   PEW’s publication and put together your own thoughts.
