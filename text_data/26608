The Miller reality

   I have come to terms that I live in a very messy zoo. Period. Four
   working adults, two active kids, 3 barking chihuahuas, 2 bored kittens
   who's main goal in their young lives is destroying what are left of the
   blinds and over-stuffed chairs. Carpets that are beyond repair or
   cleaning with spilled juice and God knows what else. Piles of dirty
   clothes and dirty dishes. So different from the environment that I grew
   up in at 5 years old with a single mom struggling to get by and my
   grandmother who occasionally lived with us. Oh, I could go on but that
   was not what I wanted to talk about this morning.
   [thumbnail_IMG_7691.jpg]
   While watching my political morning shows, I was also listening the
   Matt and Mason having a conversation in the front room. The front room
   was officially the "living room" of the house but it is now Bri and
   Matt's living room while David and I occupy the "back room" which was
   the family room where everyone watched TV. This gives us all our own
   space to live in without being on top of each other every night. I
   confess, sometimes I am a fly on the wall in my own house. Without
   actually listening to their conversations, I hear the tone and feeling
   of them. As this morning, Mason was having a serious conversation with
   Matt. I could tell by her tone and the way she was explaining something
   to him. She is very smart and articulate for a 5-year-old, always
   talking, always thinking, never quiet. Polar opposite to my 5 year old
   self, solitary and introverted.
   Sometimes, I listen to the kids while they are cooking dinner together,
   in a messy, loud kitchen with Mason sitting on the counter "helping"
   and Noah watching from the floor in her little detachable swing, also
   loudly cooing herself for all to hear. Talking about their day, what
   they did, their beliefs, their struggles and bonding with the kids.
   Occasionally stop flipping the burgers to go kiss the baby. I don't
   hear the details, but the overall feeling of this tight-knit family
   unit. And my heart soars with relief.
   Mason will run into the "back room" to jump on my chair, declaring it
   "the most comfortable chair in the entire house" while wrestling my
   twitter feed-filled phone from my hands so she can play a puzzle game.
   Saying loudly "I love you, Memaw", knowing I will not resist that and
   hand the phone over.
   Mason builds all sorts of stuff in the back room. Right now we have a
   daycare going on back here. I have to sign the kids in and out of this
   daycare that grows in size every day. I have to babysit the babies when
   Mason goes off "to work". She gives her babies a walk around the "park"
   in the stroller and ask me where the parking lot is and pays me
   imaginary money to park. It seems easier to just leave it for awhile
   than put it all away, as I know it will be back as soon as the last toy
   is in the proper storage spot.
   [thumbnail_IMG_7684.jpg]
   And lots of singing. Mason knows all lyrics to all her favorite popular
   songs from the radio and is constantly singing them the minute she gets
   out of bed. Sometimes, I dig out all of my "oldies-but-goldies" on
   iTunes and we have a music-fest of sorts. Of course, she knows one of
   my favorite groups, Earth, Wind and Fire from the Trolls movie, so we
   have an instant favorite in common there.
   Mason and David have Saturday pancake-making-mornings while the kids
   sleep in. She loves to cook, crack eggs and stir the batter. She and I
   stir up lots of brownies together. She adores David and will demand,
   "where is my Papa?" when we are coming home from work. They have a
   special bond of cooking, reading books, and playing Crazy Eights. He
   has bought her some crazy expensive books and the most beautiful
   illustrations. I am more of the "let's play electronic games" together
   or let's watch silly puppy videos on YouTube, so I guess between us,
   she gets the spectrum of entertainment.
   Lots of people, friends and family ask, when are the kids moving out?
   And my honest answers is ... I don't know, we never consider or talk
   about it. In today's reality of housing and daycare cost, it does not
   seem prudent for them to go anywhere. Not to say we all don't have our
   moments of frustration, I probably have more than anyone because of the
   mess. But the flip-side of them not being here seems horrible. I love
   watching the kids learn to be good parents and us trying to learn to be
   grandparents, not too preachy and interfering. Of course, Mason is
   spoiled. She has 4 doting adults at her disposal. If someone says "no",
   she can meander around the house to find someone who will say "yes".
   And add to that, she is crazy smart. Yes, she talks back to all of us.
   She stands her ground on any struggle. I personally think that is a
   good thing for a girl. She can back up any boy to tears on the
   playground. Coming from a background of never being able to say
   anything on my mind if it was in opposition to my mom, I believe in
   kids having "a voice". I believe I did not have one so am especially
   sensitive of being able to speak your mind. Of course, there is
   conflict in thought, but better have a strong mind than a frightened
   one, as I had.
   And coming from a divorce, single childhood (until I was 12), it is
   particularly heartening to hear my granddaughter say "Daddy, can you
   ... Daddy, would you do this or that". I never had anyone who I trusted
   to call Dad until much later in life. I feel that was a big loss in my
   childhood and effected me deeply. When I hear Mason say "Daddy, will
   you read me a book, or make me a sandwich, or get me some cookies?",
   tears literally come to my eyes. It is such a simple thing to have a
   "daddy" in the same house, but it does not always happen to many kids
   in this world.
   The Miller new reality if very messy. Sometimes, very dirty. Very
   hectic. Very loud. Very chaotic. Very fun. Lots of recycle needing to
   go out. Lots of barking. Lots of crying. Lots of dirty clothes. But
   also, lots of love and tenderness. Lots of conversations going on about
   life and learning between the kids and their kids. I love being a fly
   on the wall in my own house.

Sitting on art

   Look at these beautiful chairs by Rustique Interiors
   "Carey Naughton of ‚ÄòRustique Interiors‚Äô graduated with a Ba Hons in
   Theatre Design from Central St Martins in 1996, and has been a self
   employed artist ever since.
   ‚ÄòI work with mostly recycled textiles and furniture using a mixture of
   appliqu√© patchwork and embroidery to create figurative but fantastical
   landscapes, inhabited by a variety of different creatures. I am
   inspired by the Scottish countryside, seaside and Edinburgh
   city-scapes. The textile art is upholstered onto vintage armchairs to
   create one-off pieces of furniture.
   Before the upholstery is done I will scan the textile art and have them
   printed onto paper, after which I rework by hand with pen & ink and
   coloured pencils. These are then reproduced in a variety of ways,
   creating cushions, prints and so forth.‚Äô"

My brotherly loss

   My brother died on May 31 in Corpus Christi, at the age of 50. It is
   not the phone call I wanted to get but one that I had been expecting
   for a couple years. Today, is the first quiet, alone day I have had in
   the house to really be sad about his life and death.
   I think it is poignant that this photo I have carried around since we
   lived in Scotland, has all but faded.
   [faded.jpg]
   My brother had not been doing well for the last 20 years, drug abuse,
   alcoholism, living between a prison cell and under a bridge. It is hard
   for me to imagination what kind of hell his life has been for the last
   two decades. These are choices he made and for all the help that mom
   and I tried to give him for over 20 years, none of it seemed to matter.
   Yes, I paid for his cell phone and that allowed him to be in constant
   contact with mom while she worried 24/7 about where he was eating or
   sleeping. Yes, I sent him money via Walmart every time he called in
   trouble or needing something... food, clothes, gas money. Yes, I bought
   him that cheap car when he said he had a great job and just needed a
   little help. The same car he wrecked the next day and was returned to
   jail. Yes, I paid for him to come back and forth to Seattle to see his
   family, hoping that that would make him want to be a part of us a
   "real" life again, in a good way. Yes, Yes, Yes! I think, what else
   could I have done? My brain screams out in sadness, anger and rage at
   him but my heart is broken into a million pieces.
   This little kid, I knew him from the moment he came into this world, I
   babysat him, changed his diapers, read to him, was his sister and
   friend. This little kid, my brother is now dead from years of
   self-abuse.
   After the coroner asked questions and said this might be a homicide
   because of the amount of blood at the scene. Which, was a convenience
   store he was known to sleep behind. The coroner called back to tell me
   that he had died of natural causes and his liver literally exploded. To
   imagine my baby brother dying from vomiting blood until he died was
   more than my brain could deal with.
   I have been going through his personal papers sent to me years ago, one
   of the many returns to prison, sending stuff to his relatives. I have
   been reading his 12 step paper about his guilt of having treated his
   family so badly. About his drug abuse. About how he felt when his
   parents divorced, when he had to move, when his dad basically gave up
   on him. His private feelings written in his hand, his sorrow for his
   life is so hard for me to read. And my mind goes back to what else
   could we have done?
   He created so much chaos for the last 30 years that it is hard for me
   to think of a "good time". My mind has to wonder back all the way to
   Scotland. Like our family trip to Inverness when he and I walked around
   the city late at night. Or to Breckenridge, when I took him and a car
   load of his friends to the drive-in.
   All my other memories are terrible, gut-wrenching ones. Jail, car
   thefts, stealing my mom blind, me kicking him out of the house, me
   finding his brand new car mom had bought him at a drug dealers house.
   Me, calling the police on him and said drug dealers (with the car) on a
   nightly basis. Me, driving him to the hospital for various reasons. Me
   trying to sooth my mom when she discovered something he had done,
   stolen her guns, television, her jewelry. When I think about my mom and
   mine relationship, it was so intertwined with Mac's bad behavior and
   honestly, I got so tired of being the good kid trying to make things
   right. Or saving Mac from himself.
   He was very close with mom. When she passed away, he was devastated and
   we cried together many, many hours over the phone. When I discovered
   mom's life insurance was left to both us ... and realizing he would get
   $12,000 in one lump sum, I was really afraid for him. I begged him to
   let me take care of it for him. That money could get him a place to
   live, food to eat, he could have a some normality for a bit. Back and
   forth, and he ended up taking that money and packing up his other
   homeless friends and moving to Corpus Christi, I knew something
   terrible was just around the corner.
   The day after he took that money, he called me to post bail for him. At
   that point, I said, do not call me back. After years of trying to make
   something right, it has just gone completely wrong. And I simply had
   had enough of his bad behavior.
   I was so guilty about having a home, a family, a meal in the table, a
   bed when I knew my brother was struggling for his next bottle of cheap
   alcohol or his next fix, his next place to sleep. It was so hard to
   accept that it destroyed my mom's life daily to think of her son in
   those conditions. It was so hard not to be so very angry at what he had
   done to his life, his kids' lives, his family's life. I want to cry my
   big, heart-broken tears and try to remember the sweet times I had with
   my baby brother. Instead of searching for him on mughots to see if he
   has been arrested lately. I am hoping he is at peace now.
   [mac.jpg]
   This was the last time Mac came to Seattle to see us. It was a good
   visit.

   yellow polyester suit? What was I thinking. And matching yellow shoes!

Turning lemons into lemonaide, or tears into magazine covers
