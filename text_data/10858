A Woman‚Äôs Perspective On What It Means To ‚ÄúMan Up‚Äù (54 Photos)

   As a self-proclaimed feminist, I was asked what I think about the Daily
   Man Up feature.

   Doesn‚Äôt ‚ÄúMan Up‚Äù imply that women are weak, while men are strong.
   Doesn‚Äôt it imply that men who are not ‚Äúmanly‚Äù are not real men?

   To me, ‚ÄúMan Up‚Äù means the difference between being a boy, and being a
   man. A boy wants, a man earns. A boy won‚Äôt show emotions; a man will
   own them. He knows what it means to love, and to fear losing that love.
   A man knows who he is, why he became that way. He knows what he wants,
   and why he wants it. A man finds power from within, and not power over
   others.

   If we are constantly talking about stereotypes, then let‚Äôs talk about
   what we want our sons, our fathers, our brothers to be: courageous
   enough to care and stand up for others and everyone-not just those that
   look and act like themselves. Adventuresome enough to wander to find
   out who they are: into new careers, the outdoors, the tool sheds, the
   world. Find a sense of brotherhood on the backs of motorcycles, poker
   rooms, cigar parlors, barber shops, sports fields, backyard grills and
   barracks. Find your heroes and become them.

   Become the man your spouse, mama, sister and daughter are proud of.

   Here are some of my favorite images from Daily Man Up and other pics
   from Suburban Men, along with a few I added of my own.
