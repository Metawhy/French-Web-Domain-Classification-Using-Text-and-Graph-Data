How do I use Lia?

   Lia works similarly to other home pregnancy tests, just sans plastic,
   privacy concerns, and the sanitary issues that come with tossing a test
   in the trash. Just pee for seven seconds, lay the test flat, see your
   results and flush – or compost, or scrapbook if that’s your thing.

   For more information on how to test with Lia, read our full
   Instructions for Use and watch our “How To” video.

How does the Lia pregnancy test work?

   When you are pregnant, your body produces the pregnancy hormone hCG
   (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin). The amount of hCG that your body
   produces increases at the earliest stages of your pregnancy. The Lia
   pregnancy test can detect small amounts of this hormone in your urine.

What is the Lia test made out of?

   The Lia test is made of the same natural, plant fibers as most toilet
   paper. Each test is made from cellulose and contains no plastic, glass
   fibers, or nitrocellulose – elements found in nearly all single-use
   diagnostics. Over 2 million pounds of plastic waste is produced
   annually from pregnancy tests in the U.S. alone. Lia provides the only
   sustainable, discreet, plastic-free disposal option.

How flushable is Lia?

   Lia has been third-party proven to disintegrate in wastewater and is
   safe for most plumbing systems and homes, even ones with septic
   systems.^‡ Lia is made of the same natural, plant fibers as most toilet
   paper and weighs less than 4 squares of a leading 2-ply.^‡‡

   For best results, flush only one test at a time, and don’t flush the
   packaging, test wrapper or desiccant (silica gel pack).

   For a side-by-side comparison of flushability results for Lia, toilet
   paper, and a flushable wipe, check out our video.
