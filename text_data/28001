Combustion

   Combustion research

   Combustion research includes detailed measurements of high temperature
   (hot) and low temperature (cool) flames at sub- to above-atmospheric
   pressures, and fuel reforming in heat recirculating (superadiabatic)
   reactors. Goals of the research include elucidation of flame chemistry
   for clean and efficient advanced combustion, and development of robust
   small-scale combustion reactors.

Solid fuel conversion

   Solid fuel research

   Fuel conversion research includes pyrolysis, gasification, and
   supercritical extraction of high value chemical species from solid
   fuels, including biomass and coal. Co-processing of these fuels is
   studied for synergistic effects, as well as the potential to supplement
   fossil fuel usage with renewable biomass. Goals of this research
   include reduction of emissions from power production and alternative
   uses for solid fuel resources.
