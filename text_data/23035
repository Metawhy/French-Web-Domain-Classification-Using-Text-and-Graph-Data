BaT Auction: 1991 Acura NSX 5-Speed

   BaT Auction: 1991 Acura NSX 5-Speed

   This 1991 Acura NSX is finished in Formula Red over black leather and
   powered by a mid-mounted 3.0-liter VTEC V6 paired with a five-speed
   manual transaxle. The car spent time in Arizona, Nevada, and the New
   York City area, where it was part of the Car Club of Manhattan’s fleet
   before being acquired by the seller in January 2013 and moved to North
   Carolina. The timing belt and water pump were subsequently replaced,
   and approximately 6k of the 101k indicated miles have since been added.
   The car is fitted with later-model wheels, as well as a Kenwood head
   unit and Zanardi Edition floor mats. This NSX is now being offered for
   sale with records from the seller, a clean Carfax report, and a clean
   North Carolina title in the seller’s name.

V10/6-Speed Manual Swap: RHD 2004 BMW M3

   This 2004 BMW M3 looks completely stock from the outside, but packs the
   screaming 5.0 liter S85 V10 normally found in E60 M5 or E63 M6.
   Cosmetics aren’t flawless, but the car still looks like a good driver,
   and though details are frustratingly few, this one should be two
   handfuls of fun. Find it here on eBay in Blackwood, Wales for 30k GBP
   (~$41k USD today) OBO. Special thanks to BaT reader Stephen R. for this
   submission.

   a

   Photos aren’t the best, but the car looks to be in good driver
   condition–it’s straight with what appears to be very decent paint,
   though wheels sound like they might be a bit rough on closer
   inspection, as the seller says these have been painted at some point in
   the past, likely to hide lifting clear coat or perhaps curb damage.
   Everything outside looks bone stock, which in combination with its
   subdued color should help the car remain somewhat stealthy.

   b

   The interior looks pretty good too, though the leather steering wheel
   rim has been polished by years of use, and leather seats are just a bit
   baggy–no rips or tears are evident though, and the dash, center console
   and other trim all show very nicely. Notably, the standard E46
   instrument cluster remains, and has been recalibrated to work with the
   V10 up front.

   Says the seller: “I built this myself. It is fitted with the V10 from
   an M5/M6, and is running a 6-speed manual gearbox from an E90 M3 V8.
   It’s using the OEM factory DME (Digital Motor Electronics), so also has
   full OBD diagnostics.” No further mechanical details are provided, but
   the install does look very tidy, and really only slightly more cramped
   than it an M5 or M6. Though US factory built V10 M5’s and 6’s offered a
   6-speed manual option, it was widely regarded to be poorly matched to
   the engine’s delivery, and many prefer the standard 7-speed SMG setup.
   The E90 M3 6-speed used here might be better suited though, as that
   car’s S65 V8 is itself a derivative of the V10 seen here, and shares a
   similar high-revving character.

   A recent MOT suggests that it’s been properly built, and the seller is
   open to trades for project E30 M3’s.
