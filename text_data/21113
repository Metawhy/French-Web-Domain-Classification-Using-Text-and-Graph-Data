    3. A Century of Lithography

   This installation, drawn entirely from the Museum’s permanent
   collection, stands as a complement to the large concurrent exhibition
   dedicated to Toulouse-Lautrec. A selection of approximately 20 prints,
   A Century of Lithography documents the history of lithographic
   printmaking from the early 19th until the early 20th-century. Invented
   in the late 18th-century, lithography first came into broad use by
   artists during the Romantic era, and this installation will include
   prints by Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, and others of their
   generation. As these printmakers were at work, publishers discovered
   that thousands of impressions could be made from a lithographic stone,
   and it became the medium of choice for popular journals and posters;
   satirical prints by Honoré Daumier and Paul Gavarni will document that
   phenomenon. As the 19th-century proceeded, artists continued to explore
   the range of effects possible in the medium, and the selection to be
   shown at the Museum will include examples by Whistler, Redon, and
   Sargent, along with a group of examples taken from the Museum’s large
   collection of prints by Albert Belleroche.

Honoré Daumier. Lovers of classical art more and more convinced that art is
lost in France, 1852. Lithograph. 1994:10
