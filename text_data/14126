We believe in limitless possibilities and the power of big dreams.

   At The Arc San Francisco, we know a lot about developmental
   disabilities. But we know even more about big dreams. About the dignity
   of work. The pride of self-reliance. And the power of a community that
   works together to lift everyone up.

   For over 65 years, our lifelong learning approach has empowered every
   individual we support to achieve success at their own pace...at work,
   at life...even in love. We invite you to discover how our innovative
   programs are transforming lives while enriching all of us in the
   community.

   Let's get together on this. Let's dare to dream.

   Privacy Policy
    1. What Information Do We Collect?
       When you visit our website you may provide us with two types of
       information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose
       that is collected on an individual basis and website use
       information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others
       browse our website.
    2. Personal Information You Choose to Provide
       We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal
       information, including your email address, postal address, home or
       work telephone number and other personal information for such
       purposes as correspondence, placing an order, requesting an
       estimate, or participating in online surveys.
       If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain
       the content of your email messages together with your email address
       and our responses. We provide the same protections for these
       electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of
       information received by mail and telephone.
    3. Website Use Information
       Similar to other websites, our site may utilize a standard
       technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are
       Cookies?") and web server logs to collect information about how our
       website is used. Information gathered through cookies and server
       logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed,
       time spent at our website, and the sites visited just before and
       just after ours. This information is collected on an aggregate
       basis. None of this information is associated with you as an
       individual.
    4. How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?
       Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
       administering our business activities, providing service and
       support and making available other products and services to our
       customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use
       the information we collect to notify you about important changes to
       our website, new services and special offers we think you will find
       valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are
       developed and managed under our traditional standards designed to
       safeguard the security and privacy of all personal information
       provided by our users. You may at any time to notify us of your
       desire not to receive these offers.
    5. What Are Cookies?
       Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web
       servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies
       are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on
       the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user
       accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with
       that website by the same user or to use the information to
       streamline the user's transactions on related web pages. This makes
       it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and to
       complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should
       make your online experience easier and more personalized.
    6. How Do We Use Information Collected From Cookies?
       We use website browser software tools such as cookies and web
       server logs to gather information about our website users' browsing
       activities, in order to constantly improve our website and better
       serve our users. This information assists us to design and arrange
       our web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually
       improve our website to better meet the needs of our users and
       prospective users.
       Cookies help us collect important business and technical
       statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths
       followed by users to our website as they move from one page to
       another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit
       our website and evaluate our website's visitor capacity. We do not
       use these technologies to capture your individual email address or
       any personally identifying information about you.
    7. Notice of New Services and Changes
       Occasionally, we may use the information we collect to notify you
       about important changes to our website, new services and special
       offers we think you will find valuable. As a user of our website,
       you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not
       to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you
       receive such an offer or by sending us an email request.
    8. How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?
       When you send confidential personal information to us on our
       website, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts
       all information you input before it is sent to us. The information
       is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our website.
       Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we
       advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your
       transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do
       not send confidential information such as Social Security, credit
       card, or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.
    9. How Do We Protect Your Information?
       Information Security -- We utilize encryption/security software to
       safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect
       from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss,
       alteration or destruction.
       Evaluation of Information Protection Practices -- Periodically, our
       operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with
       organization policies and procedures governing the security,
       confidentiality and quality of our information.
       Employee Access, Training and Expectations -- Our organization
       values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to
       the protection of user information. In general, our business
       practices limit employee access to confidential information, and
       limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized
       persons, processes and transactions.
   10. How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?
       You may request access to all your personally identifiable
       information that we collect online and maintain in our database by
       emailing us using the contact form provided to you within the site
       structure of our website.
   11. Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?
       We may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales,
       website traffic patterns and related website information to our
       affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will
       not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise
       provided in this privacy policy.
   12. What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?
       We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in
       other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires
       it or for the protection of our legal rights.
   13. Permission to Use of Materials
       The right to download and store or output the materials in our
       website is granted for the user's personal use only, and materials
       may not be reproduced in any edited form. Any other reproduction,
       transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by
       any means mechanical or electronic without our express written
