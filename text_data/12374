  lyrics

   Feel the sun on my face
   Sharpened like a razor blade
   Feed the rising pain inside
   The body, soul and brain
   Living monster of the night
   You made me what I’m today
   You don’t have to scream and shout
   In this silent place
   Trapped under the neon light
   As long as the show’s alive
   The welded flesh to sweat
   And blood still flows in hell
   Warden of your nightmare
   A trip down memory lane
   You’re on the way, the end is nigh
   There’s nothing to be saved
   Living monster of the night
   You made me what I’m today
   You don’t have to scream and shout
   In this silent place
