   made in the USA (from domestic and imported parts) with aerospace-grade
   aluminum, hi-quality Panasonic battery cells and a foam-filled tire

FIT GUIDE FOR THE 29ER WHEEL

   To use any GeoOrbital wheel with disc brake bicycles you will need the
   optional brake adapter.

Checking for FIT - STEP 1

   To determine if the GeoOrbital 29er wheel will fit your bike look for
   the number immediately before the "X" printed on the side of your
   manual bike wheel.
     * If that number is "29" then the 29er wheel will fit!
     * If that number is "650," "26," or smaller then the 29er wheel will
       NOT fit.
     * If that number is "27.5," "28," or "700" then please refer to STEP
       2

Checking for FIT - STEP 2

   If the number printed on the side of your wheel is "27.5," 28," or
   "700C" then take a U.S Quarter Coin and place it lengthwise on the top
   outer edge of your tire. If the quarter doesn't hit your fork, brakes
   or fender, then you'll be able to fit out 29er wheel on your bike.

MAKE YOUR BIKE ELECTRIC IN 60 SeCONDS

   Upgrade your regular bike to an electric by swapping-out your front
   wheel for a GeoOrbital. The Edison Award winning GeoOrbital wheel is
   made in the USA (from domestic and imported parts) with aerospace-grade
   aluminum, hi-quality Panasonic battery cells and a solid-core foam tire
   that will never go flat. There is no need to install or configure any
   apps - simply clip-on the throttle and use it like a gas pedal - the
   harder you press the faster you go. The industry-leading 500 Watt (750
   Watt peak) motor puts out more power than an Olympic cyclist!

   PEDAL IF YOU WANT, SIT BACK IF YOU DON'T.

GeoOrbital 700C
     __________________________________________________________________

   The GeoOrbital 700c is the ideal wheel if you typically ride on paved
   surfaces. The wheel is powerful and widely compatible with the largest
   variety of bikes ranging from road bikes to mountain bikes. The harder
   foam-core tire mimics the tire pressure of a road bike and is optimized
   for greater range.
