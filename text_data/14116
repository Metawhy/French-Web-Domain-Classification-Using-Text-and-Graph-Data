ADARA’S VIEW OF GDPR AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Data privacy is at the core of ADARA’s business, in how we collect,
   store and process data. We understand our compliance obligations under
   the new GDPR regulation and ensure compliance with all Privacy and Data
   Protection laws and we have taken steps to ensure our data partners and
   clients can continue to work with us. ADARA applies a “Privacy by
   Design” approach to our technology and platform, ensuring that we put
   the privacy requirements of our partners and clients, and by extension,
   the consumer, first.

   These FAQs set out more information on the GDPR and what ADARA is doing
   to ensure its compliance with the regulations.


   WHAT IS THE GDPR?

   The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European Union
   regulation intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all
   individuals within the European Union (EU). It takes effect on May
   25^th, 2018, replacing the old law (Directive 95/46/EC) in place since
   1995. The new GDPR aims to protect individuals regarding the processing
   of personal data and on the free movement of such data. It also changes
   the way companies access, acquire, use, share, store and provide
   individuals with access to their personal data.


   WHAT IS ADARA DOING ABOUT THE GDPR?

   ADARA has built a platform that ensures all industry standard privacy
   regulations are met. And being compliant with GDPR is no different. We
   have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the company’s present data
   privacy and protection policies and processes; including analysis of
   how data is collected, used and shared by our platform. We are actively
   moving toward GDPR compliance in our practices, policies and
   documentation in time for May 2018.

   ADARA is also working with all our partners, clients and vendors to
   ensure we all fulfil our GDPR compliance obligations. We have reviewed
   and will make the necessary updates to our privacy policy and data
   privacy practices, and are putting in place the relevant contractual
   provisions with our partners, clients and vendors. These FAQs are
   designed to give you a firmer understanding as to how the GDPR applies
   to ADARA and how ADARA achieves compliance with it.


   WHAT PERSONAL DATA DOES ADARA COLLECT?

   What is personal data?

   The GDPR redefines the scope of personal data to extend it to any
   collected data that could directly or indirectly identify an
   individual, including unique identifiers (i.e. the use of an identifier
   to link an individual to personal data albeit without a “name” in the
   traditional sense) and data to which a unique identifier refers to
   (e.g. online activity such as travel intent).

   This unique identifier is a sequence of numbers or numbers and letters
   used as a kind of “label” that indicates to systems we, or our partners
   use, that the data in question (e.g. websites visited and viewed
   online) relates to the same individual. It is used to identify the data
   without the need to refer to a name or address (for example).

   ADARA’s collection of personal data

   At the core of our technology is the ADARA Recognized Traveler which
   gathers travel data from our trusted data partners and fuels every
   product and capability on the ADARA Platform. ADARA Recognized Traveler
   is broken down into three trusted data sources about the travelers:
    1. “Pseudonymous” data and technical identifiers;
    2. Interests for products and services; and
    3. Measurement statistics on the performances of ADARA services.

   ADARA collects only the data we see as necessary from our partners and
   clients as part of our Travel Data Co-Op. We assign to this data, in
   respect of any one user, a unique ID. Most of the data ADARA collects
   relates to travel intent and online behavior, such as online searches
   for travel and confirmation of booking for flight or hotels.

   ADARA collects data and aggregates it in a “pseudonymous” way, which
   means that we are not aiming to identify a person in the “real world”.
   The GDPR explicitly recognizes “pseudonymization” as good practice in
   protecting the interests of individuals, precisely because it makes it
   hard and sometimes impossible to recognize who users are “in the real
   world”. Personal data, collected by ADARA includes (and is further set
   out in our Privacy Promise https://adara.com/privacy-promise):
     * cookie identifier;
     * hashed email address;
     * mobile device identifier
     * hashed CRM identifier;
     * passenger number record;
     * general location data about the individual.

   ADARA ensures that no directly identifying information is stored on our
   platform, by requiring all data to be hashed before collection (i.e.
   pseudonymized). ADARA does not collect the following types of personal
   data: individual’s name or data associated to the individual’s
   physical, physiological, genetic, mental or cultural identity.


   HOW DOES ADARA COLLECT OR RECEIVE THIS DATA?

   When a user visits one of ADARA’s data partner’s websites, we collect
   and analyze information about individual consumer interests by way of
   two types of pixels; (a) a “Partner Pixel”; and (b) an “Advertising
   Pixel”. Partners provide us with access to their websites and
   applications to set and use these pixels.

   When a user visits one of ADARA’s Partner’s websites, views an email
   from a Partner with an ADARA tag, or uses an app with an ADARA SDK
   installed, we assign a unique identifier (a random, unique string of
   characters) to the user.   Our tags do not collect an individual’s
   name, user name, email address or physical address, but we may store
   and associate a hashed email address or a mobile device ID with the tag
   data we collect. Through these identifiers, we collect and store
   information about what the user does on the Partner website or
   application, and which Partner sites or apps the user visits. ADARA may
   engage in cross-device data collection and targeting, when the relevant
   data is collected. We can then build segments, or receive segment data
   from our partners and clients, to create a profile against that unique
   ID. This allows us to determine the user’s travel preferences when they
   browse online.


   WHAT IS ADARA’S ROLE IN PROCESSING DATA UNDER GDPR?

   GDPR defines a data controller is a person or legal entity, that
   decides the purpose and way in which any personal data collected online
   can be processed. Data processors on the other hand, act on the
   instruction of the data controller (processing data for the data
   controller’s purposes).

   ADARA considers our partners and advertising clients as controllers of
   the data collected about individuals searching or booking online. As we
   collect and store data on end users, assign a unique ID to those users,
   and determine the purposes for which such data is used (for example, by
   assigning users a travel score), and because our platform recognizes
   the user as he or she appears on multiple data partner sites, we are
   also a data controller in respect to personal data on our platform (see
   below on the limited circumstances in which we are a data processor).
   This includes data we have sourced from third-party providers to assist
   us in building a user profile. As such, our partners and advertising
   clients, and ADARA, are both controllers of the data. As a data
   controller of the data, ADARA will share the compliance requirements of
   GDPR with other data controllers of such data for instance by ensuring
   on our contracts with partners that compliance is assured.

   Where a partner or advertising client provides us with personal data,
   we may use this data, in conjunction with our own data, to build what
   we call a “derived data profile” for some users; meaning that we build
   on an existing segment (provided by a partner or client) to create our
   own enhanced version of the data. As such, there are two pieces to this
   puzzle; (a) the partner provided data, and (b) the derived data. We act
   as a data controller for the derived data we have collected.

   ADARA as a data processor

   There are some limited circumstances in which ADARA will be a data
   processor; where we receive personal data from advertising clients and
   a limited instruction for the use of the data. As a data processor, we
   act on the instructions of the data controller, and comply with the
   relevant provisions of the GDPR.


    ON WHAT BASIS CAN ADARA USE THIS DATA?

   Data controllers need to have and identify a ‘lawful basis’ – a
   justification recognized by the GDPR – for the data controller to have
   and use personal data. There are six lawful bases under the GDPR; two
   of which are most relevant for ADARA – consent and legitimate
   interests.

   Consent

   ADARA believes the most relevant basis for our partners and clients to
   collect and share personal data is consent. Under the GDPR, consent
   must be unambiguous, requiring a clear and affirmative action be taken
   by the consumer.

   The GDPR (Recital 32) states that consent can be given through “conduct
   which clearly indicates in this context the data subject’s acceptance
   of the proposed processing of his or her personal data.” What this
   means, is that taking an action to accept, the consumer is providing
   consent, as long as it is clearly and prominently displayed that this
   consent allows cookies to be dropped, personal data to be processed,
   and provides the intended purpose of using such data. Companies are
   also required to provide consumers with the option to revoke consent at
   any time.

   ADARA does not own the relationship with the end user, so we are
   working with, and will continue to work with, our partners and clients
   to ensure that they are providing transparency around data collection
   and consent mechanisms to the consumer on their websites and
   applications; including, where appropriate, using the IAB’s
   transparency and consent tool. This forms part of our data processing
   contractual obligations going forward.

   Legitimate interests

   GDPR recognizes that consent is not the only way to hold personal data
   – another “lawful basis” (as they are called) is legitimate interests.
   In order to have a legitimate interest to process personal data, we
   need to have a good business reason to process the data, taking into
   account the rights and freedoms of the end user. To confirm this
   position, we must balance the needs of our business against the
   interests and reasonable expectations of users of our client’s websites
   and applications (i.e. that our actions are not beyond what individuals
   expect).

   ADARA’s legitimate interest to process personal data is based on the
   following considerations:
     * We require some personal data to improve our platform;
     * We also require some personal data to perform analytics and report
       to our customers;
     * We use some personal data to monitor for and try to weed out
       fraudulent activity where computers mimic the activity of real
       users.

   For transparency purposes, we have set out in detail how we use
   personal data in our Privacy Promise. This gives individuals full
   disclosure on how we use personal data – clarifying their expectations
   on our use of their data. We have a legitimate interest to process some
   personal data to carry out our business products and services, we will
   not require consent of the end user to process their personal data.


   WHAT DOES ADARA DO WITH THIS DATA?

   ADARA collects the data, and then decides on the specific business use
   depending on one of the three main business activities in the travel
   ecosystem:

   Online advertising: We will use the collected data to make decisions or
   buy, monitor, or report on the delivery of online advertising for our
   advertiser via ad exchanges. We may also share performance data (i.e.
   relating to viewability of the ad, and any subsequent conversion) with
   advertisers and their representatives in the digital advertising
   ecosystem. During this process, we may overlay third-party data
   collected from third-party data providers, to enhance our decision
   making.

   Measurement and Analytics: Once ADARA collects data, it is collated and
   classified in the database in aggregated form, and may be made
   available via reporting or via the ADARA platform for high level trend
   analysis in an aggregated form. We may also use the data to create
   analytics about travel industry trends, effectiveness of media, or for
   content marketing.

   Traveler Intelligence: ADARA may share aggregated, pseudonymous data
   with our partners or clients for the purposes of enhancing their CRM
   for personalization or merchandising optimization.

   The collected data may also be transferred either in aggregated or
   encrypted format to our vendors and suppliers; including cloud data
   centers and hosting providers. The data will also be used for specific
   internal ADARA operations including troubleshooting, data analysis,
   testing, research, and statistical or survey purposes.

   We limit the use of personal data so that it is consistent with our
   transparency obligations and consent obtained from the end user, where
   appropriate.


   HOW LONG DOES ADARA KEEP THE DATA?

   ADARA will never store data for longer than necessary and always in
   accordance with data privacy laws and regulations.

   As is the normal practice in the advertising technology industry, we
   set our cookies to expire after the two-year mark.

   For online identifiers like Mobile IDs that remain active indefinitely
   for the use of the device, ADARA dissociates the data after the period
   of two years from the last encounter with the end user.

   We retain some personal data, received through the ADARA Partner
   websites or the ADARA website, for as long as we require to fulfill a
   legitimate business need. We retain and use information as is necessary
   to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements.


   HOW DOES ADARA PROTECT PERSONAL DATA?

   ADARA uses state of art data hashing technology and strict processes to
   ensure that no directly identifying information of end users is stored
   on our systems.

   ADARA also employs administrative, physical and electronic measures
   designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access. These
   measures include encryption of personal data and employment of
   information storage security technologies to block access from outside
   our network.

   For more information on how we protect personal data, please review our
   Privacy Promise.


   WHAT MECHANISMS DOES ADARA HAVE IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR THE TRANSFER OF
   PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA)?

   ADARA recognizes that the EEA has established strict protections and
   requirements regarding the handling of personal data, and parts of it
   that may be transferred outside the EEA. The personal data ADARA
   collects may be transferred or stored at a destination outside the EEA,
   and may be accessed by ADARA employees situated outside the EEA or one
   of our suppliers.

   Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our
   services, we will take all steps necessary to ensure that it is subject
   to the appropriate safeguards. One of the mechanisms we use to
   safeguard the date includes our self-certification of the EU-US Privacy
   Shield Framework, set forth by the US Department of Commerce. ADARA
   adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice,
   Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and
   Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

   To read more about our International Transfers of personal data and the
   EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, please see this section in our ADARA Privacy
   Promise.


   WILL ADARA BE REVIEWING PRESENT CONTRACTS AND INCORPORATING NEW PRIVACY
   TERMS?

   We believe it is important for digital advertising companies to do the
   right thing and embrace the principles of the GDPR and push compliance
   and good practice in our business relationships. As part of that, the
   GDPR requires that we give contractual commitments to our customer
   where we act as a data processor or controller and we have prepared
   template terms that do that and comply with the GDPR. Where we act as a
   data controller, we think it is in everyone’s interests to set out the
   privacy-related commitments we make to each other so we are aligned on
   how data is protected.

   We will be communicating with the relevant parties on a case-by-case
   basis and providing our recommendations for amendments or changes as
   necessary.


   HOW DOES ADARA HANDLE DATA SUBJECT ACCESS AND ERASURE RIGHTS?

   ADARA provides several mechanisms for consumers to opt out of ADARA’s
   services. An opt out mechanism can be found on all ads served by ADARA,
   in our privacy policy and on the following member websites that allow
   customers to opt out of targeted ads:
     * Network Advertising Initiative
     * DAA
     * IAB Europe

   Once a consumer has opted out on one of these mechanisms, ADARA will
   cease serving any targeted ads to that consumer on the browser they
   opted out of.  As part of this opt-out, ADARA will commit to exclude
   the user from any individually targeted action such as content
   personalization.  Whilst the data will still be available, it is no
   longer considered “personal” and can be used for certain analytics.

   Additionally, if a consumer requests that their data be erased in
   total, from our system, (subject to any data we must hold for a
   legitimate business purpose) or to be sent to them, we will process
   this request once we have affirmed that the pseudonymous identifier we
   hold, matches the information provided by the user. This request can be
   made and carried out directly on our website, ADARA.com.

Privacy Promise

   TRUSTe
   TRUSTe

   Updated November 5, 2018

   ADARA’s Privacy Promise
   ADARA’s Privacy Promise is to explain in a transparent way, how we
   collect data from our business Partners to perform our business
   activities. We’ll explain how we carry out our digital advertising
   services and analytics products. ADARA is a business-to-business
   company in the online advertising technology and analytics businesses.
   Our products and services enable our clients to buy advertising space
   online and use our measurement and analytics products.  This Privacy
   Promise also describes the types of data we collect from our partners
   and how we use, share and secure the data to provide our services
   through our platform (“ADARA Platform”). We’ll try to make this all as
   clear and as simple as possible, but if you have questions, you can
   contact us at privacy@adara.com, and we’ll be happy to help.

   Please read the following carefully to understand our use of your
   personal data and how the ADARA Platform collects data from our
   Partners’ websites, which is where we are receiving your data.

   Who We Are and What We Do
   ADARA provides digital advertising and analytics services for the
   benefit of our business customers, giving them the ability to reach and
   understand Internet users and consumers (like you) who are most likely
   to be interested in their respective products and services. ADARA
   provides these services to customers such as website operators and
   mobile application developers that have installed ADARA tags or SDKs
   (“Partners”). Consumers (like you) benefit from ADARA’s technology by
   receiving more relevant online marketing content.

   As a common example: if you visit an airline or hotel website to book a
   flight or a hotel room and the airline or hotel website is an ADARA
   Partner, then we will collect your search or booking travel intent
   about the destination including some related information (dates, class
   of travel, number of people travelling with you – for a full list see
   the table below).  We do not collect your name or your email (unless
   already hashed so we never hold the actual email address) and we take
   care to ensure that we do not collect anything that tells us, or anyone
   we work with, who you are “in the real world”. Our intention is to
   never collect any information about you that can directly identify you.

   Our Platform automatically recognises that it is the same user (without
   knowing who you are) if you visit another ADARA Partner site and book
   or enquire about another flight, hotel or travel product.  The platform
   “knows” it is you because we assign a random unique identifier we call
   an “ADARA Recognized Traveller ID” and in our secure database, we log
   information about your travel interests and bookings which links to the
   ADARA ID unique to you. We also use profiling, including algorithms, to
   analyse your interests online and assign a score based on your travel
   activity. This improves our, and our Partners’ ability, to serve
   related advertising to those with an interest in travel.

   What Do We Mean By Personal Data?
   “Personal Data” is defined as any data relating to a living individual
   who can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in
   conjunction with other information.  It can take the form of a name or
   address and, now, under new data protection laws in Europe, this can
   extend to uniquely generated IDs, IP addresses and other “unique
   identifiers” which do not tell us who a user is in the “real world”.

   We cannot identify a user by name or find out where they live, but
   instead it gives us and our business customers a picture of the travel
   behaviour demographic characteristics of a user (like frequented
   destinations, type of trip (business vs leisure), their gender and the
   types of travel, products and services they are interested in) which we
   may assign to a user on our platform.

   What personal data does ADARA collect?
   At the core of our technology is the ADARA Recognized Traveller which
   gathers travel data from our trusted data partners and fuels every
   product and capability on the ADARA Platform. ADARA Recognized
   Traveller is broken down into three trusted data sources about the
   travellers:
    1.   “Pseudonymous” data and technical identifiers;
    2.   Interests for products and services; and
    3.   Measurement statistics on the performances of ADARA services.

   ADARA collects data and pseudonymizes it, which means that we are not
   aiming to identify a person in the “real world”. Personal data,
   collected by ADARA includes:
     *    cookie identifier;
     *    hashed email address;
     *    mobile device identifier
     *    hashed CRM identifier;
     *    passenger number record;
     *    general location data about the individual.

   ADARA ensures that no directly identifying information is stored on our
   platform, by requiring all data to be hashed before collection (i.e.
   pseudonymized). ADARA does not collect the following types of personal
   data: individual’s name or data associated to the individual’s
   physical, physiological, genetic, mental or cultural identity. We do
   not knowingly collect or categorize users based upon sensitive data or
   ‘special categories of data’, such as racial or ethnic origins,
   political or religious beliefs, financial information, precise
   information about health conditions or treatments or other similar or
   related information. ADARA does not collect any sensitive or special
   categories of data.

   We neither intentionally collect information from, nor target any
   services to, children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have
   collected information of a child under 13, we delete that information
   as soon as possible.

   How do we collect personal data?
   When a user visits one of ADARA’s data partners’ websites, we collect
   and analyze information about individual consumer interests by way of
   two types of pixels; (a) a “Partner Pixel”; and (b) an “Advertising
   Pixel”. Partners provide us with access to their websites and
   applications to set and use these pixels.

   When a user visits one of ADARA’s Partner’s websites, views an email
   from a Partner with an ADARA tag, or uses an app with an ADARA SDK
   installed, we assign [through the Partner Pixel] a unique identifier (a
   random, unique string of characters) to the user, a “cookie. A similar
   thing happens when a user sees or interacts with an online
   advertisement which has been placed through our Platform.  Our tags do
   not collect an individuals name, user name, email address or physical
   address, but we may store and associate a hashed email address or a
   mobile device ID with the tag data we collect. Through these
   identifiers, we collect and store information about what the user does
   on the Partner website or application, and which Partner sites or apps
   the user visits. In the case of the Advertiser Pixel, we use the
   identifiers to collect information on how the users view and interact
   with the online ad (for instance the time it is viewable by the user,
   whether they click on the ad). ADARA may engage in cross-device data
   collection and targeting, when the relevant data is collected. This
   means we use third party providers to determine the likelihood that a
   given user on a desktop browser is the same user on a mobile device,
   and then we link the information we have on their desktop and mobile
   device activity. ADARA may also engage in cross-app data collection and
   targeting. This means we use a unique identifier to collect data from a
   particular device regarding application use over time and across
   non-Affiliated applications. We can then build segments, or receive
   segment data from our partners and clients, to create a profile against
   that unique ID. This allows us to determine the users travel
   preferences when they browse online.

   What does ADARA do with this data?
   ADARA collects the data, and then decides on the specific business use
   depending on one of the three main business activities in the travel
   ecosystem:

   Online advertising: We will use the collected data to make decisions or
   buy, monitor, or report on the delivery of online advertising for our
   advertiser via ad exchanges. We may also share performance data (i.e.
   relating to viewability of the ad, and any subsequent conversion) with
   advertisers and their representatives in the digital advertising
   ecosystem. During this process, we may overlay third-party data
   collected from third-party data providers, to enhance our decision
   making. We may also use data to target ads on televisions and
   peripheral devices.

   Measurement and Analytics: Once ADARA collects data, it is collated and
   classified in the database in aggregated form, and may be made
   available via reporting or via the ADARA platform for high level trend
   analysis in an aggregated form. We may also use the data to create
   analytics about travel industry trends, effectiveness of media, or for
   content marketing.

   Traveller Intelligence: ADARA may share pseudonymous data, always
   aggregated to not identify one partner or brand, with our partners or
   clients for the purposes of enhancing their CRM for personalization or
   merchandising optimization.

   The collected data may also be transferred in encrypted format to our
   vendors and suppliers; including cloud data centers and hosting
   providers. The data will also be used for specific internal ADARA
   operations including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research,
   and statistical or survey purposes.

   We limit the use of personal data so that it is consistent with our
   transparency obligations and consent obtained from the end user, where
   appropriate.

   The Security of Your Personal Data
   ADARA cares about your privacy and employs administrative, physical and
   electronic measures designed to protect your personal data from
   unauthorized access. These measures may include encryption of personal
   data you provide and employment of information storage security
   technologies to block access from outside our network.

   Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information
   over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Although
   we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
   the security of your data transmitted to our website and any
   transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal
   data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
   prevent unauthorised access.

   Please also be mindful that we are not responsible for the security
   measures of third parties, e.g. our Partners. As noted above, for more
   information about their personal data collection and usage practices,
   please see their respective privacy policies.

   How long do we process personal data for?
   ADARA will never store data for longer than necessary and always in
   accordance with data privacy laws and regulations. As is the normal
   practice in the advertising technology industry, we set our cookies to
   expire after the two-year mark.

   For online identifiers like Mobile IDs that remain active indefinitely
   for the use of the device, ADARA dissociates the data after the period
   of two years from the last encounter with the end user.

   We retain some personal data, received through the ADARA Partner
   websites or the ADARA website, for as long as we require to fulfill a
   legitimate business need. We retain and use information as is necessary
   to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements.

   What are your rights?
   You have the following rights in relation to personal data relating to
   you that we process:
     *      You may request access to the personal data we hold about you
       (please see the section on obtaining access to your personal data,
       below).
     *      You may request that any incorrect personal data about you
       that we are processing be rectified.
     *      In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to request that
       we erase the personal data concerned subject to some specific legal
       reasons we may have to retain certain data relating to you.
     *      Where we are processing personal data relating to you on the
       basis of your prior consent to that processing, you may withdraw
       your consent with the Partner website at any time, after which we
       will be notified or you can notify us directly to stop the
       processing concerned.

   We will process this request once we have affirmed that the
   pseudonymous identifier we hold, matches the information provided by
   the user. This request can be made and carried out HERE. Alternately,
   you can also email privacy@ADARA.com We will respond to each request
   within 30 days.

   Please note that we may be required to ask you for further information
   in order to confirm your identity before we provide the personal data
   requested. Also note that even after a deletion, some personal data may
   remain temporarily in back-up copies until the next back-up rotation or
   overwriting cycle.

   If you have a complaint about any processing of your personal data
   being conducted by us, you can contact us or lodge a formal compliant
   with the Supervisory Authority in the Member State of your habitual
   residence, place of work, or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR.
   How to Opt-Out of Interest-based Advertising
   ADARA provides several mechanisms for users to opt out of ADARA’s
   advertising and analytics services. You can use multiple methods to
   opt-out : ADARA’s opt-out mechanism via this URL on ADARA.com, click on
   the-opt out link on the advert itself, or you can do the browser based
   or mobile based opt-outs. In all cases, all of these opt-outs will be
   recorded and honored by ADARA.
   Opt-out on ADARA.com
   Please go HERE to let us know that you’d like to opt-out of ADARA
   advertising
   Browser based opt-out
   To opt out via your browser, the following member websites will allow
   users to opt out of targeted ads:
     * Network Advertising Initiative
     * DAA
     * EDAA

   Once a consumer has opted out of one of these mechanisms, ADARA will
   cease serving any targeted ads to that consumer on the browser they
   opted out of.  As part of this opt-out, ADARA will commit to exclude
   the user from any individually targeted action such as content
   personalization. Remember that opting-out is browser-specific. So, if
   you have multiple browsers or multiple devices you use to access the
   internet, you’ll need to opt out from each device or browser.

   Mobile opt-out
   To opt-out of the collection and use of data for interest-based
   advertising on your mobile device, you can modify the settings on your
   mobile device. To reset your mobile advertising ID or to opt out of
   interest-based ads in mobile apps, please follow your mobile device
   maker’s most current published instructions, such as the examples
   linked and pasted in below (current as of the date of this version of
   our Privacy Promise):

   For Android Devices (version 8.0 and higher): Open the Settings app,
   Select Google, Select Ads, and enable the “Opt Out of Ads
   Personalization” setting.

   For Apple Devices: Devices with iOS 6 and above use Apple’s Advertising
   Identifier. To learn more about limiting ad tracking using this
   identifier, visit the Settings menu on your device as follows: Go to
   Settings, Select Privacy, Select Advertising, and enable the “Limit Ad
   Tracking” setting. For more information about different iOS versions,
   please see: https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT202074.

   When you have opted out using this setting on a device, and when ADARA
   receives this signal, ADARA will not use in-app information collected
   from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device
   that are targeted based on your inferred interests.

   Note: The specific opt-out instructions for each device may differ
   slightly depending on which version of the operating software you are
   running.

   In addition, as noted above, we participate in the DAA’s Ad Choices
   program. So, each of our mobile ads includes the AdChoices Icon, on
   which you can tap to go to an opt-out page.

   To learn more about how to use platform controls for opting out on
   mobile devices, please visit this link :
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice)

   Changes to this Privacy Promise
   Any personal data that we collect is subject to the version of this
   Privacy Promise in effect at the time the information is collected.
   However, we reserve the right to revise this Privacy Promise at any
   time. If appropriate, we’ll notify you of any material changes to the
   Privacy Promise by posting them clearly on our website or by sending
   you an email or other notification if we have your contact information,
   and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective. This
   Privacy Promise was last updated on the 24th May 2018.

   users is be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the
   European Economic Area (“EEA”) that may not be subject to equivalent
   data protection laws. It may also be processed by staff situated
   outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our vendors.. This
   includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of
   orders, the processing of payment details and the provision of support
   services. We have set this out in more detail in the “International
   Transfers…“ section below.

   International Transfers

   Overview
   Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our
   services we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it
   is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognised
   legal adequacy mechanism which may include complying with the EU-US
   Privacy Shield transfer mechanism and that it is treated securely and
   in accordance with this Privacy Promise.

   ADARA recognizes that the EEA has established strict protections
   regarding the handling of personal data, including requirements to
   provide adequate protection for personal data transferred outside of
   the EEA. To provide adequate protection for certain personal data about
   our Partners’ users, received in the United States, ADARA (which shall
   include entities and subsidiaries covered by ADARA’s privacy shield
   certification) has elected to self-certify to the EU-US Privacy Shield
   Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.  ADARA adheres
   to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for
   Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation,
   Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

   With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the
   Privacy Shield Framework, ADARA is subject to the regulatory
   enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain
   situations, ADARA may be required to disclose personal data in response
   to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national
   security or law enforcement requirements. To learn more about the
   Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
   Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov. To review
   ADARA’s representation on the Privacy Shield list, see the US
   Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield self-certification list located
   HERE.

   In this Privacy Promise, we have set out the categories of personal
   data that we may receive in the US, as well as the purposes for which
   we use personal data. Before we use your personal data for a purpose
   that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or
   that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to
   opt out. ADARA maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that
   personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and
   current. We have also set out above the relevant security provisions
   and access rights available to you.

   Third Party Agents or Service Providers
   ADARA is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives,
   under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a
   third party acting as an agent on its behalf [including Ad Exchanges
   and our Partners].  Where required by the Privacy Shield, we enter into
   written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers
   requiring them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy
   Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified
   services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate
   steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process
   personal data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to
   stop and remediate any unauthorized processing. ADARA remains liable in
   accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents
   that we engage to process such personal data on our behalf do so in a
   manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove
   that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
   Please click HERE for more information on our third-party partners.

   Questions or Complaints relating to the Privacy Shield Framework
   In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, ADARA commits
   to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of
   your personal data.  EU based individuals with inquiries or complaints
   regarding this privacy promise should first contact us at
   privacy@ADARA.com. Under certain conditions, more fully described on
   the Privacy Shield website
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you
   may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures
   have been exhausted.
