EliteSingles NZ Dating: we can help you find local love

   If you're among the many local singles looking for love in NZ, dating
   may not always seem easy – but hope is out there: the trick is to start
   your search in the right place. Indeed, with EliteSingles, it is easier
   than ever to find love on your wavelength. We're the right choice for
   Kiwis wanting more from love - all you need do is join us today!

Single life in NZ:

   New Zealand is surely one of the prettiest places on earth. From icy
   glaciers to hot sand beaches, from bustling cities to forests full of
   birdsong, New Zealand has a global reputation as being a virtual slice
   of heaven.

   Unsurprisingly, New Zealanders themselves are also viewed as a pretty
   friendly bunch; always there with a ‘good on ya, mate.’ What may be
   more surprising is just how many of these convivial, friendly Kiwis are
   single – recent figures show only 57% of Kiwis aged 16+ live with a
   committed partner! In other words, if you are looking for local, single
   men or single women in New Zealand, you're in good company!

New Zealand dating culture:

   Of course, while it is one thing to know that there are plenty of local
   single people out there, meeting them is quite another! Successful,
   professional New Zealanders tend to invest a lot of time in their work
   and not everyone is built to spend their leisure time looking for a
   partner and dating in NZ’s various bars and clubs.

   It is hardly surprising, then, that Kiwi men and women are getting
   smart and, increasingly, turning to online local dating sites to find
   love.

Why try NZ dating with EliteSingles?

   As it happens, there are several options for those looking for local
   singles and wanting to try online dating in New Zealand. The only thing
   is, with sites catering for everything from lonely farmers to lovelorn
   vegetarians, it can be hard to decide what NZ dating site is right for
   you. Of course, if you find yourself single, successful and desirous of
   a long-term relationship, there is perhaps one site that might just
   stand above the rest…

Kiwi singles on your wavelength:

   The typical EliteSingles member is someone with high standards – in
   work, in love and in life. Often successful and highly educated, our
   members come from a range of backgrounds and from locations across New
   Zealand but, nevertheless, they have one major thing in common: they
   are looking for long-term love with someone truly like-minded.  Our
   members are on EliteSingles to look for genuine, loving commitment –
   our job is to help them find it.

   We want to ensure that every EliteSingles match is based on long-term
   compatibility. When we suggest potential matches between our members,
   it is because we think their pairing has a real chance of becoming
   something wonderful. We establish this compatibility by basing our
   matchmaking technique on three distinct criteria: New Zealand location,
   user personality and relationship preferences. These combine to give us
   a clear idea of our members and what they want; creating a formula that
   has already helped many happy Kiwi couples find love.

Expert local dating advice and a secure, supportive service:

   As well as our dedication to creating genuine matches, we have a
   commitment to customer security, offering up-to-date Fraud Detection
   Systems, Manual Profile Verification and SSL Encryption as standard
   across our site.

   Additionally, our user support system includes our magazine, which
   features expert NZ dating advice (including exclusive tips from our
   in-house Psychologist, Salama Marine). This means that, whether you are
   after advice on finding the perfect match, looking for local dating
   recommendations, or simply wanting ways to have a better first date,
   you can find it all here, on EliteSingles.

   If you're ready to meet local singles on your wavelength and to
   experience the best of what NZ dating has to offer you, then join us
   today.

   EliteSingles › About us

About us

   EliteSingles is brought to you by Spark Networks Services GmbH, one of
   Europe’s leading online matchmaking providers. Founded in 2008 in
   Berlin, (former Affinitas) launched its first online dating portal
   eDarling in Germany in May 2009. Today, the company has earned the
   trust of more than 13 million singles, creating on average 2000 couples
   every month in over 20 countries worldwide.

   EliteSingles is a partnership service designed for singles in New
   Zealand looking for a long-term commitment. Our smart profiling
   delivers compatible partner suggestions in line with your personal
   search preferences, and we manually verify all new profiles to ensure
   users have a smooth, safe environment in which to meet other
   like-minded singles.

   Our vision is to maintain the industry's highest standards – to be the
   dating site as committed as our members are to finding love.  Numerous
   certifications and awards testify how successful we already are in this
   area. Nevertheless, the most important indicator of the value of our
   work is, and will always remain, the couples that meet each other
   through our platforms on a daily basis.

Our Matching Process

   The EliteSingles matching process introduces members on the basis of an
   initial personality questionnaire and your individual search
   preferences. We curate the site by manually verifying all profiles,
   automatically removing inactive members, and proactively removing users
   we suspect are not serious. This means our members have a smooth
   browsing experience and can focus on dating.

   The EliteSingles personality profile is based on the “Big Five” model
   of personality psychology. Initially developed in the 1990s, it is one
   of the most important and renowned concepts in modern psychology. Using
   the results of five personality dimensions, we are able to identify
   couples who are particularly well suited to a long and happy
   relationship together. Then, if the couple's demographic data and
   personal preferences are also a match, the two members are suggested to
   each other.

   The demographic data we consider includes gender, age, residence,
   profession and level of education. Additionally, in order to match
   personal preferences we explore various aspects that could be
   significant for long-term relationship prospects. For instance, we ask
   "How important is your future partner's religion?" and "Do you want
   children? “

   Protecting your personal information is of our utmost priority. We
   utilise Manual Profile Verification, SSL Encryption and a Fraud
   Detection System to make sure members feel safe online. All sensitive
   data is encrypted and will not be revealed to any third party or other
   members.

   EliteSingles is also available in Australia, the United Kingdom, the
   USA, Ireland, Canada, and South Africa.

   gay dating, Asian dating, older dating), but they are united by one
   main thing: the desire for a lasting, loving, mutually-supportive
   relationship.

   We support their search by providing one the best NZ dating sites for
   career-minded singles, and by offering supportive dating advice.
   Whether you're interested in lesbian dating, single parent dating, over
   50 dating or another specific, we can help you meet NZ singles on your

     Looking for someone who is educated and motivated hasn't always been
     easy for me. After checking out EliteSingles, I decided to give it a
     try. I had to play around with the settings a little, but the people
     I am being suggested are precisely what I am looking for. So far, so
     good. Sarah - Wellington

     I had seen commercials for EliteSingles, and was originally
     hesitant. But after registering and interacting with the site, I was
     impressed with the quality of my partner suggestions and just how
     much they took into consideration what I was looking for in my
     search for a partner. I have to admit I have been pleasantly
     surprised. Mark - Auckland
