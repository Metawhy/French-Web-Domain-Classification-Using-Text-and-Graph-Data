Hello

Meet Debi

   My true passion has always been cooking, baking and more recently, food
   styling and photography. I credit my cooking skills to my 96 year-old
   mom who has always encouraged me to watch, learn and complete the
   challenge of recreating her recipes.
   My 3 sons, two daughter-in-laws and husband are both my greatest fans
   and my biggest critics. Their support and encouragement throughout my
   journey has been unmeasurable.

   Debi Traub is exactly like her food photography — fun, colorful, full
   of life, and ready to jump off the page at any given moment. As
   intricate and masterful as her food presentation appears, her recipes
   are actually simple and doable, even for someone like me who is not
   anything close to a chef. Debi also approaches everything with
   positivity and a sense of humor that makes you want to take the journey
   with her and think you can do it too

   The name “Simply Beautiful Eating” really says it all. Debi’s
   straight-forward recipes, gorgeous photos and fun glimpses into her
   kitchen will have you wishing you were in the kitchen helping out or
   your elbows on the counter eagerly waiting to lick the frosting off the
   whisk! When we work with Debi, I rest easy knowing everything will be
   delivered on time and she’ll have provided a crowd-pleasing recipe for
   our partners. And while she may be best known her baked goodies, don’t
   let all those sweets fool you, her savoury stuff is fantastic too!

   When simplybeautifuleating popped up in my Instagram feed I was
   immediately taken by surprise and thought, this person is doing
   something REALLY cool and different from all the other foodie feeds I
   was following. Every week I look forward to seeing her incredibly
   gorgeous photos and reading her recipes while laughing out loud the
   entire time. No one else can make something as simple as baking muffins
   so funny and lighthearted.

   Debi has been an early and active member of the feedfeed community for
   the past few years. We have had the benefit of working with her both as
   editor on our website and as a content creator for many of our brand
   partners. Debi carefully creates health oriented recipes and shoots
   beautifully composed photos time and again. She is a pleasure to work
   with and puts 110% into everything she takes on. We truly value her
   involvement and participation in our community.
