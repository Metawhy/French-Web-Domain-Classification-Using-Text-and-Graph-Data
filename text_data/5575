The Sane Way to Manage Software on Windows

   System engineers spend hours deploying & configuring Windows software
   manually. Traditional tools are not built for modern automation and a
   DevOps approach, which can make achieving consistency and gaining
   insights across your environment difficult.

   There are a lot of different installer formats and multiple approaches
   to deploying Windows software. Deploying software without package
   management on Windows can be complicated and time-consuming.

   Chocolatey simplifies this through a simple, repeatable, and automated
   approach, by using a universal packaging format for managing all
   Windows software. It doesn't matter if you are using native installers,
   zips, scripts, binaries or in-house developed applications and tools –
   Chocolatey treats them as all 1st class citizens.

   Write once, deploy anywhere, with anything, and then simply track &
   manage.

Chocolatey - Software Management for Windows

   Chocolatey Logo

What is Chocolatey?

   Chocolatey is a software management solution unlike anything else
   you've ever experienced on Windows. It focuses on simplicity, security,
   and scalability. You write a software deployment in PowerShell once for
   any software (not just installers), then you can deploy it everywhere
   you have Windows with any solution that can manage systems
   (configuration management, endpoint management, etc) and track and
   manage updates of that software over time. Manage software on-premise,
   in the "Cloud", or in Docker containers with Chocolatey.

   Whew, that was a mouthful! For a bit more detail into what all of that
   means and more, see What is Chocolatey?

       Server)

Chocolatey Styleguide

Learn how to use the official Chocolatey Theme to create standalone projects
which reflect the Chocolatey Brand.

   IMPORTANT!
   Please read through this Chocolatey Styleguide before starting a
   project that is meant to use the Chocolatey Theme.

Getting Started Quick

   The Chocolatey Theme uses Bootstrap v4.3.1 as its underlying framework,
   and extends it with custom styles. This Chocolatey Styleguide is meant
   to be used in conjuction with the Bootstrap Documentation and only
   covers components that have been extended from Bootstrap to fit
   Chocolatey's style needs. Therefor, if an item you are searching for is
   not listed in this Chocolatey Styleguide, it is safe to say this theme
   is using the default assets covered by Bootstrap, and should be
   referenced there.
   Download Chocolatey Theme Files

CSS

   After downloading the Chocolatey resources above, include either the
   "chocolatey.slim.css" (recomended) OR "chocolatey.css" <link> into your
   <head> before all other stylesheets. The "chocolatey.slim.css" file
   contains only the css classes needed to style a basic website, nothing
   more (this is what Chocolatey.org is using!). If for some reason this
   slim version is not fitting the needs of your project, instead include
   the full build "chocolatey.css". Both files include Bootstrap CSS
   v4.3.1 and custom styles to extend Bootstrap.

JavaScript

   Many of Bootstrap's componets require JavaScript to function at their
   full potential. After downloading the Chocolatey resources above, place
   the following <script> near the end of your pages, right before the
   closing </body> tag. This bundled file contains jQuery v3.3.1,
   Bootstrap JS v4.3.1, Popper.js v1, Clipboard.js, and custom features to
   extend the Chocolatey Theme. Do not include these files seperately in
   your project!
<script src="/js/chocolatey.js"></script>

<!-- Optional JS for use of Syntax Highlighting -->
<script src="/js/prism.js"></script>
