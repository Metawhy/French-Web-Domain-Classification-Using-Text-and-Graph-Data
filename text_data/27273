   experiment, play, and find your personal favorites—or save the
   travel-ready samples for your next trip. See past boxes.

   PLAY! by SEPHORA FAQs
   Q: What does a subscription to PLAY! by SEPHORA include?
   A: Inside each month’s box, you’ll find:
     * Six makeup, skincare, and hair-care samples from top brands (five
       of which are trial size!) worth up to $65
     * A reusable, recyclable makeup bag

     Access to exclusive video how-tos and tutorials about how to use the
   products in your box Q: Do I pick the samples I receive?
   A: The PLAY! by SEPHORA experts curate a selection of prestige products
   each month, so you don’t have to choose anything! We know beauty isn’t
   one-size-fits-all, so each month we choose which of these products we
   think are best for you, based on the answers you provide in your PLAY!
   PROFILE. In order to help us learn more about your beauty preferences
   and needs, be sure to complete your PLAY! PROFILE, which you can access
   at www.sephora.com/play-quiz. If you have any questions, chat with us
   on BeautyTalk.
   When will I receive my first box?
   A: Due to high demand, your first box will usually arrive the month
   after you sign up (i.e., if you sign up between January 1 and January
   31, your first box will arrive in February.) In limited instances, when
   you sign up between the first and the fifteenth day of a month, your
   first box will arrive during this same month. You will receive an
   email, confirming when your box ships.
   Q: Can I purchase a PLAY! BOX without a subscription?
   A: Currently, the only way to regularly receive a PLAY! by SEPHORA box
   is by subscribing to the program. From time to time, past boxes are
   available for individual purchase here
   SUBSCRIPTION
   Q: I submitted my email to be notified when new spots become available.
   Now what?
   A: You will be notified by email when new spots open up. You can then
   click through from the email to claim your spot and subscribe. We add
   new subscriptions throughout the month, so you will most likely be
   hearing from us soon!
   Q: Can I subscribe to PLAY! by SEPHORA in a Sephora or Sephora inside
   JCPenney store?
   A: Right now, the only way to subscribe is at Sephora.com/PLAY.
   Q: Can I purchase a subscription as a gift?
   A: We’re glad to hear you want to share PLAY! by SEPHORA with friends!
   Unfortunately, at this time you can only purchase a subscription for
   yourself.
   Q: Do I need to do anything after I subscribe to receive my box?
   A: We’d love to learn a little about you! After signing up, be sure to
   complete your PLAY! PROFILE on www.sephora.com/play-quiz. Your box will
   still arrive if you don’t.
   Q: How do I update my subscription shipping address or billing
   information?
   A: You can make adjustments to your shipping address or billing
   information by going to your Subscriptions page in your account,
   scrolling to the PLAY! by SEPHORA section, and selecting “Edit”. Your
   information must be changed before the first of the month to affect the
   current month’s box. For example, if you would like to update your
   subscription details for the June box, you will need to do so by May
   31.
   RETURNS AND CANCELLATION
   Q: Can I return or exchange items from a box?
   A: Products included in a PLAY! by SEPHORA box are handpicked each
   month, so we are unable to offer returns or exchanges on the box or the
   items. If something is missing or damaged, please refer to the
   questions below.
   Q: What is the cancelLation policy?
   A: You may cancel your subscription at any time by following the
   instructions on your Subscriptions page in your account or by calling
   Customer Service at 1-844-PLAY-HLP. As of May 1, 2016, cancellations
   must be made before the first of the month to affect the current
   month’s box. If you cancel after the first of the month, you will be
   charged for and receive that month’s PLAY! by SEPHORA box, which will
   be your final one. For example, if you would like to cancel and not
   receive the May box, you must do so by April 30. There is no
   cancellation fee, and we’ll be sorry to see you go!
   SHIPPING
   Q: How much does shipping cost?
   A: Nothing! It is included in your monthly subscription fee.
   Q: Where does PLAY! by SEPHORA ship?
   A: PLAY! by SEPHORA is currently only available in the US and can ship
   to any address in the 50 states. We cannot ship to APO/FPO addresses or
   US territories at this time; however, we are working to change this and
   will let you know as soon as we begin shipping to these areas.
   Q: When will I receive my box?
   A: All PLAY! by SEPHORA boxes will arrive within a three- to five-day
   period around the twentieth of every month. You will receive an email
   when your box ships, so you can track it to your doorstep.
   Q: I have Sephora FLASH. Does this affect my shipment?
   A: Currently, FLASH membership does not apply to shipping for PLAY! by
   SEPHORA.
   Q: What are the dimensions of the PLAY! by SEPHORA shipment?
   A: The shipping carton measures 7 1/2"" x 7 1/2"" x 2 1/4"".
   PAYMENT
   Q: When will I be billed for my subscription?
   A: You will be charged the monthly fee and applicable sales tax for
   your recurring subscription between the first and fifth of each month,
   except in some instances, when you order between the first and the
   fifteenth day of a month, and we are able to ship your first box during
   the month in which you sign up. In that event, you will be charged the
   monthly fee and applicable sales tax for your first month’s box on or
   about the sixteenth of the month, after which, standard billing will
   resume. For example, if you sign up on January 5 and we have inventory
   to make January your first box, you will be charged for the January box
   on or about January 16. You will be charged for the February box on or
   about February 1–February 5. If we are unable to complete a charge, we
   may retry at a different time that month.
   Q: What payment methods can I use?
   A: You can pay using a debit card, a credit card, or PayPal. We accept
   Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Card. At this time we
   are unable to accept JCPenney Credit Cards, online credit, eGift Cards,
   gift cards, or any other payment method for PLAY! by SEPHORA
   subscriptions.
   Q: Do you charge sales tax?
   A: If applicable, sales tax will be added to your monthly subscription
   fee.
   Q: Can I use a promo code when purchasing my subscription?
   A: Currently, promo codes do not apply.
   Q: Do I receive Beauty Insider points with my purchase?
   A: Yes! Your monthly subscription fee qualifies for Beauty Insider
   points. Also, each month you can show your current PLAY! PASS when
   purchasing items in store or online to receive 50 bonus points. Each
   PLAY! PASS can only be used once and expires at the end of the
   following month (for example, a PLAY! PASS for the month of September
   would expire on 10/31).
   THE FINE PRINT
   PLAY! by SEPHORA is a monthly subscription program.
   By subscribing to PLAY! by SEPHORA, you understand and agree that you
   are opting in to a monthly product subscription and that each month
   Sephora will charge the credit card you designate now (or later by
   updating the Subscriptions page in your account or through a customer
   service representative), the then-current monthly subscription fee
   (plus applicable taxes) until you cancel.
   You may cancel at any time by following the instructions on your
   Subscriptions page in your account or calling Customer Service at
   1-844-PLAY-HLP.
   Products included as part of each monthly PLAY! by SEPHORA product box
   cannot be returned in store or online. If you have received a damaged
   or incomplete box, please contact Customer Service at 1-844-PLAY-HLP or
   PlayHelp@sephora.com.
   If you are not already a Beauty Insider member, you will automatically
   become one when you subscribe to PLAY! by SEPHORA.
   For full details, see the PLAY! by SEPHORA Program Terms.
