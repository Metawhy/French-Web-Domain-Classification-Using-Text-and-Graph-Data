CI5: Cancer Incidence in Five Continents

   Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) is the result of a long
   collaboration between the International Agency for Research on Cancer
   and the International Association of Cancer Registries. The series of
   monographs, published every five years, has become the reference source
   of data on the international incidence of cancer. The CI5 databases
   provide access to detailed information on the incidence of cancer
   recorded by cancer registries (regional or national) worldwide in three
   formats:
     * CI5 I-X
       Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volumes I to X
       which presents the data published in the ten first volumes of CI5.
     * CI5plus
       Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Time Trends
       which contains annual incidence for selected cancer registries
       published in CI5 for the longest possible period.
     * CI5 XI
       Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume XI
       which contains the data from volume XI.
