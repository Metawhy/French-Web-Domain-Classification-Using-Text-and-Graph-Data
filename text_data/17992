   Creativity and invention has long been seen as a “black box.” As
   business people, we don’t typically try to understand this process. We
   fully expect that when designers, inventors, and other creative people
   go into a room with a goal, they will come out with more or less
   creative discoveries and results. Although when we watch them at work,
   we can observe some combination of sketching, animated conversations,
   messy desks, and drinking. But the fundamental nature of what happens
   in that room remains mostly a mystery.

   It’s easy to leave creativity to the creative types, and say to
   yourself, “I’m just not a creative person.” The fact is that in a
   complex, dynamic, competitive knowledge economy, it’s no longer
   acceptable to take this position. If you are a knowledge worker, you
   must become, to some degree, creative.

   That may sound a bit scary, but the fact is that successful creative
   people tend to employ simple strategies and practices to get where they
   want to go. It’s not so much that they employ a consistent, repeatable
   process that leads to consistent creative results. It’s more like a
   workshop with a set of tools and strategies for examining things
   deeply, for exploring new ideas, for performing experiments and testing
   hypotheses, to generate new and surprising insights and results.

   So we set out, much like the brothers Grimm, to collect the best of
   these practices wherever we could find them, with a special focus on
   Silicon Valley, innovative companies, and the information revolution.

   Many of these practices emerged from a kind of “Silicon soup” – the
   deeply interconnected network of Silicon valley, where ideas and people
   cross-pollinate like bees in a single massive hive. The practices live
   in a mostly oral culture, passed along from person to person by word of
   mouth. For example, a consultant uses an approach with a client, and
   the client begins to employ that approach internally. Over time, as
   more people employ a method, it evolves into something quite different,
   and over time the source of the original idea or approach may be lost.
   Sometimes methods are written down and sometimes, like folk tales, they
   exist in many different versions in many places.

   We chose to call this practice “Gamestorming” because it seemed to come
   closer to describing the phenomenon than anything else we could think
   of.

   Our goal with this collection was to find the best of these tools and
   practices and bring them together into a single place.

   It is our hope that you will contribute games based on your personal
   knowledge and experience, that you will help us clarify the history of
   the ideas and practices, and that through your comments you can help us
   all better understand the complex and fascinating history of games at
   play in creative work.

Altitude

   Written by
   Dave Gray
   Posted in
   Games for any meeting, Games for opening
     __________________________________________________________________

   Object of play
   Sometimes it can be difficult to keep a meeting on track when people
   have a hard time staying focused at the right level. People can find
   themselves “down in the weeds” or operational details when the meeting
   is supposed to be strategic, or, conversely, they can find themselves
   being too abstract and strategic when operational detail is exactly
   what’s needed. You can use Altitude to agree on expectations and keep
   people focused at the right level to serve the goals of the meeting.

   Number of players
   Any number of people can play this game.

   Duration: 5 minutes.

   How to play
   1. Create a chart like the one shown below.

   2. Give everyone a sheet of paper. Ask, “Who knows how to make a paper
   airplane? and ask for a show of hands. If there are people who don’t
   know how, either show them or ask someone at their table to do so. Now
   ask everyone to make a paper airplane. If time permits, you might offer
   them a chance to test their planes to make sure they fly.

   3. Reveal the altitude chart, and ask the group to define what they
   mean by the satellite level, or the airplane level, and the ground
   level. For example, if people say that the satellite level is too high
   but the ground level is too detailed, ask them for examples of the
   kinds of things that they would consider at the right altitude. Then
   ask them for examples of things that would be too low or too high.

   4. When you have reached some consensus on the right altitude level,
   put a mark on the page to represent the “right” altitude.

   5. Now tell people that whenever they notice the conversation going too
   high (abstract, vague, strategic) or too low (down in the weeds,
   tactical, operational) they can float their airplane and that will be a
   signal to the group.

   Strategy
   Meetings often go off track when someone pulls conversations into the
   wrong “altitude.” When this happens people often tune out, or even
   leave. In most meetings there is no simple, easy feedback mechanism
   people can use to keep the meeting on track. Giving people such a
   feedback mechanism (and making it fun) makes it easier for people to
   weigh in, keeping the meeting on track.

   Many thanks to Bensound for the excellent music and to Boardthing for
   the online whiteboard tool.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Object of play
   Personal Kanban is a tool for organizing your work to be more efficient
   and productive.

   Number of players
   Any number of people can play this game.

   Duration: 10-15 minutes.

   How to play
   1. Divide a whiteboard or sheet of paper into four columns: Backlog,
   Ready, Doing, and Done. Or you can use this template.

   2. Using sticky notes, fill the “Backlog” column with all the work that
   needs to get done.

   3. Move the highest priority jobs to the “Ready” column. Then rank the
   jobs in the “Ready” column, from highest to lowest priority.

   4. Take the top one to three jobs from the “Ready” column and move them
   to the “Doing” column. These are the things that you will work on right
   away.

   5. As you finish each job, move it to the “Done” column.

   Strategy
   The key to understanding and using Personal Kanban effectively is
   understanding the nature of work. First, the importance of each job on
   your to-do list shifts over time, so you want to regularly
   re-prioritize your backlog, taking things off that are no longer
   important and moving important things to the top of the list (That’s
   your “Ready” column). Second, there are only so many things you can do
   well at any one point in time. So limiting the work-in-progress in your
   “Doing” column ensures you are not taking on too much and keeps you
   focused on getting things done.

   Personal Kanban can be used by individuals or teams to make their work
   visible and transparent to customers and colleagues. This allows better
   group conversations about what is important and why. Another advantage
   is that kanban boards show what people are working on, so it can help
   teams gain a better understanding of their capacity, which can in turn
   help teams justify new hires when they are needed.

   Personal Kanban was created by Jim Benson, based on kanban as used in
   Lean manufacturing.

Hero’s Journey Agenda

   //davegray.looplogic.com/heros-journey-agenda-1/embedded?layout=7&loop=
   false&autoplay=false&social=false&leadgen=false
     __________________________________________________________________

   Object of play
   The Hero’s Journey Agenda is a unique and different way to lay out the
   agenda for a meeting or workshop that creates a sense of adventure and
   builds anticipation for the meeting.

   Number of players
   One, usually the facilitator, created live in front of a group.

   Duration: 10-15 minutes.

   How to play
   I am going to give you a script here, based on the video above. But
   this exercise works best if you make it your own, using a story you
   love and that you feel your audience will be familiar with, like a
   favorite fairy tale or movie.

   1. Draw a large circle on a whiteboard or flip chart. Tell people,

   “This circle represents all the things we’re going to do today. We’re
   starting out up here (point to the top of the circle), and we’re going
   to take a hero’s journey.”

   If you have geeks in the room, can actually talk about it in terms of
   Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings, or another story you expect the group
   to be familiar with.

   You can also say,

   “Any story, any epic adventure follows this basic format. This is
   something that a guy named Joseph Campbell came up with. He wrote a
   book called The Hero Of A Thousand Faces, which you can look up.
   Basically, the hero’s journey works like this. You begin in ordinary
   life. This is where everyone is coming into a meeting. We’re actually
   in our ordinary lives right now, and we’re going to do some special
   work and we’re going to be moving outside of ordinary life.”

   2. Draw a stick figure at the top of the circle. Now say,

   “The hero’s journey basically has two big components to it. There is
   the known world, which are the things that we kind of already know, the
   regular work and so forth. There’s the unknown, which are the things
   that we hope we will discover and explore during the course of this
   meeting.”

   Draw a wavy line to represent the boundary between the known and
   unknown.

   “This is called the threshold. It’s the threshold between the known and
   the unknown.

   3. Now say,

   “Here we are on the hero’s journey. The first thing in the hero’s
   journey is the call to adventure. That is where we talk about things
   like: What are we going to do? What’s the work that we’re going to do?
   Why is it important? What brings us to this point?”

   Write “The Call” at around 1 o’clock on the circle, and talk about the
   purpose of the meeting. You may want to ask people why they came and
   what their expectations are.

   4. Now draw a couple of stick figures at around 2 o’clock, and say,

   “You’re going to find in the beginning of any story, you’re going to
   find the helpers and the mentors. You’ve got, whether it’s Dumbledore
   or Gandalf or Obi Wan, whoever that character is, the droids, the
   characters that are going to help you. These are the characters that
   are going to help you find your way.”

   Helpers can be things like teaching people how to use sticky notes in a
   certain way. There are a lot of Gamestorming tools in this category. We
   call them openers. So you can tell people “We’re going to meet our
   helpers and mentors.” Those helpers might be tools, or people, experts
   that we might bring in. It could be a keynote speaker.

   5. Next you will talk about crossing the threshold between the known
   and the unknown.

   “Now, where we cross the threshold, that’s usually a good time for a
   coffee break. It’s the end of the morning, coffee or tea, depending on
   what country you’re in. Maybe both. We’re going to have a break.”

   You can draw a coffee cup or a teacup here.

   6. Now say,

   “Next, we’re going to start getting into the trials and tribulations.
   We call this problems and pitfalls. It’s the part of the journey where
   you’re exploring the problem space.”

   There may be all kinds of activities or things that you’re going to do
   here. You might be brainstorming, you might be working stuff out, might
   be drawing a map of the system. There are a bunch of things that you
   can do to explore this problem space. In a story, you’re going to find
   all kinds of challenges: you have to climb the mountain, you have to
   fight the trolls, all the things that have to happen to move the story
   forward.

   Write the words “Problems and pitfalls,” and draw some explosions here,
   or barbed wire, or something representing problems and pitfalls, at 4
   and 5 o’clock on your circle.

   7. Now write the word “Pit” and draw a pit at the bottom of the circle.
   The pit, in a day long meeting, might be lunchtime.

   “Every story has its pit. The belly of the whale, the cave. I just call
   this the pit. We’ve hit the bottom. This can be a tough space to be,
   because we’ve just opened up all these problem spaces and issues and
   things that we have to deal with. It may feel like we’re never going to
   get home. The pit is also the place here Bilbo Baggins finds the ring.
   It’s the place where the deep reflection, the real powerful learning
   can also happen. Over lunch might be a good time to explore what is
   down here in the pit. What are we feeling like? What are the emotions?”

   8. Now write “Powers” and draw some stars, or a superhero stick figure
   with a cape, something that represents powers, around 7 or 8 o’clock,
   and say,

   “We come out of the pit after lunch and we’re creating new powers.
   We’re solving problems. We’ve learned how to use the force. We’re now
   solving problems, we’re creating solutions, we’re working on things
   together. These kind of tools we might be using here would be customer
   experience map, service blueprint, we might be designing, we might be
   prototyping a product. This is where we’re actually getting cool
   results out of the meeting, but we still have to take that back to
   work.”

   9. Now write “The return” at around 10 o’clock, and say,

   “That’s part of the hero’s journey, too, the return to ordinary life.
   We have to go back and cross the threshold again. This time is all
   about those powers that you’re bringing back. We want to come back to
   the workplace with gifts. Think, new ideas, new thoughts. We want to
   spend some time thinking about, “How do we take this back to work?”

   This is the part of the meeting where you make some time for the group
   to think together about how they are going to bring the new ideas from
   the meeting back into the organization. What am I going to do in my
   next meeting? How am I going to explain this to my team? You might
   actually work on the PowerPoint together or work on some documents that
   are about sharing what you actually did during the meeting.

   10. At this point you can close the exercise by asking people if they
   have any thoughts and additions before you proceed with the meeting.

   Here is an example of a completed agenda:

   Strategy
   This is a very powerful way to set up an agenda for a relatively large
   scale session of work. Spend some time upfront on this. Draw it out and
   talk through it with key stakeholders, either before the meeting or at
   the beginning of the meeting. It is also a good litmus test to help you
   think through the goals of your meeting. If you can’t answer questions
   like, “What’s the call to adventure? What are the problems we want to
   explore? What are the things that we want to find? What are the things
   that we want to bring back to work?” and if you can’t sort of think
   these through at the beginning of a meeting, then it’s legitimate to
   ask yourself, should we really have this meeting?

   The Hero’s Journey Agenda seems to work really well, not only for
   designing the agenda but for making sure you have all the major bases
   covered and creating positive energy and enthusiasm for the whole
   endeavor.

   The Hero’s Journey Agenda was created by Dave Gray. It was inspired by
   The Hero’s Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell, and the Pie Chart
   Agenda, which comes from James Macanufo, co-author of Gamestorming.

Update to the Empathy Map

   Written by
   Dave Gray
   Posted in
   Facilitator resources

   We designed the Empathy Map at XPLANE many years ago, as part of a
   human-centered design toolkit we call Gamestorming. This particular
   tool helps teams develop deep, shared understanding and empathy for
   other people. People use it to help them improve customer experience,
   to navigate organizational politics, to design better work
   environments, and a host of other things.

   Why update it?
   I have seen a lot of versions of the Empathy Map since we created it so
   many years ago, and they vary widely. The Empathy Map was created with
   a pretty specific set of ideas and is designed as a framework to
   complement an exercise in developing empathy. While the success of the
   Empathy Map is exciting and makes us very happy, a lot of the thinking
   has gotten lost in translation over the years, and the various versions
   that have proliferated across the web have somewhat degraded the
   original concept.

   More recently, I worked with Alex Osterwalder, designer of the Business
   Model Canvas, to develop a new tool for mapping organizational culture
   called the Culture Map, and in that process I learned a lot about
   canvas design.

   So I decided to create a new version of the Empathy Mapping Canvas,
   applying what I learned from Alex to make the tool more usable and to
   deliver better experiences and outcomes.

   More information, including a list of what’s new and some facilitation
   guidelines.

Empathy Map

   Empathy map, originally uploaded by dgray_xplane.

   The empathy map, one of XPLANE’s methods for understanding audiences,
   including users, customers, and other players in any business
   ecosystem, has gotten some press lately because it was featured in Alex
   Osterwalder‘s excellent book, Business Model Generation as a tool for
   discovering insights about customers.

   Here’s how it works:

   GOAL: The goal of the game is to gain a deeper level of understanding
   of a stakeholder in your business ecosystem, which may be a client,
   prospect, partner, etc., within a given context, such as a buying
   decision or an experience using a product or service. The exercise can
   be as simple or complex as you want to make it. You should be able to
   make a rough empathy map in about 20 minutes, provided you have a
   decent understanding of the person and context you want to map. Even if
   you don’t understand the stakeholder very well, the empathy-mapping
   exercise can help you identify gaps in your understanding and help you
   gain a deeper understanding of the things you don’t yet know.

   1. Start by drawing a circle to represent the person and give the
   circle a name and some identifying information such as a job title. It
   helps if you can think of a real person who roughly fits the profile,
   so you can keep them in mind as you proceed. In keeping with the idea
   of a “profile” think of the circle as the profile of a person’s head
   and fill in some details. You might want to add eyes, mouth, nose,
   ears, and maybe glasses if appropriate or a hairstyle to differentiate
   the person from other profiles you might want to create. These simple
   details are not a frivolous addition — they will help you project
   yourself into the experience of that person, which is the point of the
   exercise.

   2. Determine a question you have for that stakeholder. If you had a
   question you would want to ask them, or a situation in their life you
   want to understand, what would that be? You might want to understand a
   certain kind of buying decision, for example, in which case your
   question might be “Why should I buy X?”

   3. Divide the circle into sections that represent aspects of that
   person’s sensory experience. What are they thinking, feeling, saying,
   doing, hearing? Label the appropriate sections on the image.

   4. Now it’s time for you to practice the “empathy” portion of the
   exercise. As best you can, try to project yourself into that person’s
   experience and understand the context you want to explore. Then start
   to fill in the diagram with real, tangible, sensory experiences. If you
   are filling in the “hearing” section, for example, try to think of what
   the person might hear, and how they would hear it. In the “saying”
   section, try to write their thoughts as they would express them. Don’t
   put your words into their mouth — the point is to truly understand and
   empathize with their situation so you can design a better product,
   service or whatever.

   5. Check yourself: Ask others to review your map, make suggestions, and
   add details or context. The more the person can identify with the
   actual stakeholder the better. Over time you will hone your ability to
   understand and empathize with others in your business ecosystem, which
   will help you improve your relationships and your results.

The long table

   Games for any meeting

   The Long Table is a dinner party structured by etiquette, where
   conversation is the only course. The project ingeniously combines
   theatricality and models for public engagement. It is at once a
   stylised appropriation and an open-ended, non-hierarchical format for
   participation. Both of these elements – theatrical craft and political
   commitment – are mutually supporting in this widely and internationally
   toured work. The (often-feminised) domestic realm here becomes a stage
   for public thought.

   Here’s a great article by Pete Sena of Digital Surgeons on the power of
   Gamestorming, called Breaking Up with Brainstorming: How Gamestorming
   Helps Build an Innovation Culture. It references research on some
   problems with brainstorming and why Gamestorming enhances the creative
   power of groups.

   Squiggle birds is a quick exercise that you can use to get people
   stretching their visual thinking muscles. It takes about five minutes
   and quickly, clearly demonstrates how little effort is really required
   to make meaningful, easy-to-read images. The main point of the
   demonstration is that our minds are already pattern-making machines,
   and very little drawing is actually required to convey an idea. The
   mind will fill in the rest.

   I learned this exercise from my friend Chris Glynn, a fine teacher who
   teaches fine things.

   Object of play
   You can use the Draw Toast exercise to introduce people to the concepts
   of visual thinking, working memory, mental models and/or systems
   thinking. This also works as a nice warm-up exercise to get people
   engaged with each other and thinking visually. Plus, it’s fun!

   Number of players
   Any number of people can play this game.

   Duration: 10-15 minutes.

   How to play
   On paper or index cards, ask people to draw “How to make toast.”

   After a couple of minutes, ask people to share their diagrams with each
   other and discuss the similarities and differences. Ask people to share
   any observations or insights they have about the various drawings. You
   are likely to hear comments about the relative simplicity or complexity
   of the drawings, whether they have people in them, how technical they
   are, how similar or different they are, and so on.

   Depending on why you are doing the exercise you may want to point out
   the following:

     Note that althought the drawings are all different, they are all
   fundamentally correct. There are many ways to visualize information and
   they all enrich understanding rather than being “right” or “wrong.”

     Although the drawings are different in content, they tend to be
   similar in structure. That is, most drawings of mental models tend to
   contain three to seven elements, connected by lines or arrows.
   Strategy
   The main point of this exercise is to demonstrate the power of visual
   thinking to represent information.

   Visualizations of this kind tend to be easily understandable, although
   they are visually as rich and diverse as people. Pictures can be
   fundamentally correct even though they are quite different. There is no
   “one right type” of visualization.

   When people visualize a mental model, they usually will include 5-7
   elements, linked together by lines or arrows. The number of elements
   tends to correspond to the number of things people can hold in their
   working memory, also known as short-term memory (See The Magical Number
   Seven, Plus or Minus Two for more information).

   This is also a nice warm-up exercise that is fun and gets people
   talking to each other.

   There is an excellent TED talk by Tom Wujec which you may want to watch
   in preparation. It may also be useful to show to the group in sessions
   as a way to share insights after the exercise. Tom also has a page with
   ideas for extending this exercise into group problem-solving which you
   can find at DrawToast.com.
