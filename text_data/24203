Atlanta Child Murders - What Mindhunter didn't tell you about the
controversial case

   There's been a pretty big update this year.

   By Laura Jane Turner
   19/08/2019

   Note: This article contains spoilers for Mindhunter season 2.

   Netflix's Mindhunter has revisited the Atlanta Child Murders and
   subsequent conviction of Wayne Williams; a case that the FBI's fairly
   new (at that time) Behavioural Sciences Unit was heavily involved in.

   In 1979 in Atlanta, a number of young, black children (mostly male)
   started to go missing. In some cases, their bodies started to be
   discovered weeks or months later, leaving families and communities
   devastated.

   For the three years that the disappearances and killings were engulfing
   Atlanta, it had a profound effect on life there. As seen on Mindhunter,
   local television stations would report every update, often ending each
   broadcast with the question: 'Do you know where your children are?'

   agent who interviewed him

   This was unfolding against a political backdrop which saw the city, the
   capital of the state of Georgia, trying to emerge from its pivotal role
   in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement into a new progressive era for black
   Americans. In 1973, Atlanta had elected its first black Mayor, Maynard
   Jackson – also the first to hold office in a southern state.

   Jackson was under a lot of pressure to provide answers. He had put
   forward a financial reward for information that would lead to catching
   the culprit. It is said that during that time period, he ordered extra
   protection for his own children, which also goes some way to illustrate
   the fear of the time.

   Greg Pridgeon, a former aide to the Mayor, previously said that the
   time of the murders was "difficult" to live and work in.

   "He [Mayor Jackson] put extra pressure on the police and on himself to
   make this bad situation go away," Pridgeon explained in The Atlanta
   Journal-Constitution's 2003 obituary for Jackson.

   "It was a difficult time in his administration and his life – young
   black kids getting snatched up and killed... Him seeing young
   Atlantans, whom he loved dearly, killed, hurt him."

   John Douglas, one of the leading criminal profilers whose pioneering
   work helped shape the investigative approach towards solving violent
   crimes, was among the FBI agents that provided assistance in the
   Atlanta investigation. In Mindhunter, the character of Holden Ford has
   been inspired by him.

   A special task force was put together to investigate Atlanta's missing
   children and the murders, made up of officers from the Atlanta police
   department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

   According to FBI documents, Special Agents consulted with the Atlanta
   Police Department's Task Force in 1980. They spent a number of days
   reviewing the case files and three crime scene sites, and it was
   concluded that a psychological profile of the potential suspect could
   be offered for victim Angela Lanier at that time. This was based on
   reviewing, analysing and researching cases of a similar nature (as
   detailed in Mindhunter and the interviewing of repeat offenders).

   Months later, when two more victims were found (Clifford Jones and
   Charles Stephens), the FBI provided two more psychological profiles.
   Although the psychological profiles haven't been published, it is now
   known that, among other psychological characteristics (based on the
   Behavioural Science techniques), the suspect was thought to be a black
   male.

   FBI agent John Douglas

   Based on sites where bodies had been recovered from, and patterns of
   behaviour relating to the assailant, the FBI agents recommended a plan
   to monitor the bridges and the river in the city. During one of the
   stakeouts, detectives reported hearing a splash in the early hours of
   the morning. They pulled over the car that was driving by at this time
   and questioned the driver, Wayne Williams. They did not have enough
   evidence to hold him at that time.

   But when Wayne Williams was eventually taken into police custody, the
   FBI's John Douglas responded to a reporter's question about what he
   thought of Williams as a suspect. "I replied that he looked 'good'," he
   wrote in the Mindhunter book of the same name. "And that if he panned
   out, he'd probably be good for at least several of the cases."

   This got him in trouble, though. "Even though the FBI had asked me to
   do the interview, they said I was speaking inappropriately about a
   pending case," Douglas claimed. He subsequently got a "letter of
   censure" from the Bureau. This was followed by a "letter of
   commendation" for his work on the Atlanta case.

   Having provided the criminal profile, Douglas's involvement continued
   through Williams' trial (via AJC) reportedly to help prepare the
   prosecution to plan its cross-examination.

   Wayne Williams was charged with two murders; Nathaniel Cater (aged 27)
   and Jimmy Ray Payne (aged 21). Payne was thought to be friends with
   Patrick Rogers (also known locally as Pat Man), another victim in the
   spate of tragedies in Atlanta.

   Related: Are we right to have an obsession with true crime?

   Williams was convicted in 1982 in the cases of Cater and Payne, and is
   now serving a life sentence. Despite investigators believing that he is
   also responsible for at least some of the other murders from the time
   period of 1979-1981, most of them children, Williams has never faced
   charges in court for any of these other cases. In fact, nobody has.

   Williams has always asserted his complete innocence. He has tried to
   appeal and get his conviction overturned, but has not been successful.

   Because police alleged that Williams was likely responsible for most of
   the Atlanta murders, they closed the bulk of the other cases. One
   presumed victim, Darron Glass, is actually still missing.

   Due to the fact that there have never been concrete answers or
   convictions to back them up, there have been a number of theories over
   the years.

   As touched on in Mindhunter, many living in Atlanta at the time –
   particularly in the black community – feel that the Ku Klux Klan might
   have been involved. This was one of the threads investigated in the
   2018 podcast, Atlanta Monster.

Atlanta Child Murders - Is there an update in any of the cases?

   Fast-forward to 2019 and the current Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance
   Bottoms, has re-opened the cold cases and wants to have evidence
   retested using up-to-date DNA technology (via New York Times).

   This will be a joint effort between the Atlanta Police Department, the
   Fulton County District Attorney's Office and the Georgia Bureau of
   Investigation. (It's worth noting that five of the murders were
   committed in DeKalb County; they were reopened in May 2005 by the
   County Police Chief Louis Graham but were closed a year later).

   The focus of this reinvestigation, according to Bottoms, is not to
   determine whether or not Williams was, in fact, involved, but to
   finally provide answers to those that the tragedies directly affected.

   The Mayor recently spoke to Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields, and she
   said that re-examining evidence "may give some peace – to the extent
   that peace can be had in a situation like this – to the victims'
   families" (via CNN).

   Catherine Leach, whose 13-year-old son Curtis Walker is among the
   unsolved cases, has responded to the news, telling CNN that she wants
   to finally know what happened to her child all those years ago.

   "I've been going through this for a long time. I have been let down,"
   she said. "It seems like the Atlanta missing and murdered children have
   been forgotten in this city... I don't think it's right for all these
   kids to be killed in this city and nobody was concerned about it."

   "I want some closure," she added. "I want to know who killed Curtis."

   Mindhunter season two is now available to stream on Netflix, along with
   Mindhunter season one.

   Atlanta investigation. In Mindhunter, the character of Holden Ford has
   been inspired by him.

   A special task force was put together to investigate Atlanta's missing
   children and the murders, made up of officers from the Atlanta police
   department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

   According to FBI documents, Special Agents consulted with the Atlanta
   Police Department's Task Force in 1980. They spent a number of days
   reviewing the case files and three crime scene sites, and it was
   concluded that a psychological profile of the potential suspect could
   be offered for victim Angela Lanier at that time. This was based on
   reviewing, analysing and researching cases of a similar nature (as
   detailed in Mindhunter and the interviewing of repeat offenders).

   Months later, when two more victims were found (Clifford Jones and
   Charles Stephens), the FBI provided two more psychological profiles.
   Although the psychological profiles haven't been published, it is now
   known that, among other psychological characteristics (based on the
   Behavioural Science techniques), the suspect was thought to be a black
   male.

   FBI agent John Douglas

   Based on sites where bodies had been recovered from, and patterns of
   behaviour relating to the assailant, the FBI agents recommended a plan
   to monitor the bridges and the river in the city. During one of the
   stakeouts, detectives reported hearing a splash in the early hours of
   the morning. They pulled over the car that was driving by at this time
   and questioned the driver, Wayne Williams. They did not have enough
   evidence to hold him at that time.

   But when Wayne Williams was eventually taken into police custody, the
   FBI's John Douglas responded to a reporter's question about what he
   thought of Williams as a suspect. "I replied that he looked 'good'," he
   wrote in the Mindhunter book of the same name. "And that if he panned
   out, he'd probably be good for at least several of the cases."

   This got him in trouble, though. "Even though the FBI had asked me to
   do the interview, they said I was speaking inappropriately about a
   pending case," Douglas claimed. He subsequently got a "letter of
   censure" from the Bureau. This was followed by a "letter of
   commendation" for his work on the Atlanta case.

   Having provided the criminal profile, Douglas's involvement continued
   through Williams' trial (via AJC) reportedly to help prepare the
   prosecution to plan its cross-examination.

   Wayne Williams was charged with two murders; Nathaniel Cater (aged 27)
   and Jimmy Ray Payne (aged 21). Payne was thought to be friends with
   Patrick Rogers (also known locally as Pat Man), another victim in the
   spate of tragedies in Atlanta.

   Related: Are we right to have an obsession with true crime?

   Williams was convicted in 1982 in the cases of Cater and Payne, and is
   now serving a life sentence. Despite investigators believing that he is
   also responsible for at least some of the other murders from the time
   period of 1979-1981, most of them children, Williams has never faced
   charges in court for any of these other cases. In fact, nobody has.

   Williams has always asserted his complete innocence. He has tried to
   appeal and get his conviction overturned, but has not been successful.

   Because police alleged that Williams was likely responsible for most of
   the Atlanta murders, they closed the bulk of the other cases. One
   presumed victim, Darron Glass, is actually still missing.

   Due to the fact that there have never been concrete answers or
   convictions to back them up, there have been a number of theories over
   the years.

   As touched on in Mindhunter, many living in Atlanta at the time –
   particularly in the black community – feel that the Ku Klux Klan might
   have been involved. This was one of the threads investigated in the
   2018 podcast, Atlanta Monster.

Atlanta Child Murders - Is there an update in any of the cases?

   Pue, Aaron Jackson

   Fast-forward to 2019 and the current Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance
   Bottoms, has re-opened the cold cases and wants to have evidence
   retested using up-to-date DNA technology (via New York Times).

   This will be a joint effort between the Atlanta Police Department, the
   Fulton County District Attorney's Office and the Georgia Bureau of
   Investigation. (It's worth noting that five of the murders were
   committed in DeKalb County; they were reopened in May 2005 by the
   County Police Chief Louis Graham but were closed a year later).

   The focus of this reinvestigation, according to Bottoms, is not to
   determine whether or not Williams was, in fact, involved, but to
   finally provide answers to those that the tragedies directly affected.

   The Mayor recently spoke to Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields, and she
   said that re-examining evidence "may give some peace – to the extent
   that peace can be had in a situation like this – to the victims'
   families" (via CNN).

   Catherine Leach, whose 13-year-old son Curtis Walker is among the
   unsolved cases, has responded to the news, telling CNN that she wants
   to finally know what happened to her child all those years ago.

   "I've been going through this for a long time. I have been let down,"
   she said. "It seems like the Atlanta missing and murdered children have
   been forgotten in this city... I don't think it's right for all these
   kids to be killed in this city and nobody was concerned about it."

   "I want some closure," she added. "I want to know who killed Curtis."

   Mindhunter season two is now available to stream on Netflix, along with
   Mindhunter season one.
