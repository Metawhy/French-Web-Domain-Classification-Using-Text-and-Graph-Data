   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. Let's imagine your phone
   rings without break, you can't enjoy even a single heartbeat in
   silence. What do you do when unsolicited calls grind down your every
   nerve? Do you ignore calls or do you answer them? And above all: Who
   calls you? Rest assured, you are not the only one to suffer such
   annoyances. For this very reason, ie.tellows.net aims to divulge the
   spam and scam callers by providing a plattform for all those who must
   endure the harassment of telemarketers and other dubious entrepreneurs.
   Not only does tellows attempt to present its users with the most up to
   date information on the nuisance callers, but also provides the
   instrument to point at the callers location.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   In order to achieve our goals it is imperative to sum up every
   information available on the callers. That's when you come into play.
   By sharing your knowledge on spam and scam numbers in form of comments
   and your ratings you feed a complex alghorithm that not only produces
   the tellows-score but also gives advice on the trustworthiness of the
   numbers calling you. But at the end of the day, it will your
   participation that will generate the amount of information needed to
   save people before they suffer the consequences of being scammed. Share
   your knowledge and, therewith, negate the scammers greatest advantage
   that is the people's ignorance.

       It's a dept collecting agency, they call few times a week. I don't
       pick up and I advise you to do the same. Some people says to pay up
       because you are not gonna be able to take credit etc for the next
       five years, guess what I don't really care
