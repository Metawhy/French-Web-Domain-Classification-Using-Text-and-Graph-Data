The Paradox of Doping in Mountain Climbing

In alpinism, supplemental oxygen is a matter of safety—but some say it’s
doping.

   We’re usually comfortable deciding whether or not an athlete is doping.
   Lance Armstrong was definitely doping by using erythropoietin. Tennis
   player Novak Djokovic, on the other hand, was definitely not doping
   when he slept in an egg-shaped barometric chamber.

   We tell one from the other by a kind of cultural gestalt, sorting out
   those who dope and those who don’t. Then we take that one step farther
   and reason: Those who don’t, compete cleanly—those that do, cheat.

   But what if a substance is both performance-enhancing and a benefit to
   an athlete’s health? What if that substance is oxygen?
   Not doping: Some athletes use a barometric chamber like this one to
   help prepare for competition. Despite its direct effect on their
   physiology, it is not banned or regulated.Daniella Zalcman

   The top of Everest is in what the Swiss alpinist Edouard Wyss-Dunant
   nicknamed the “death zone,” meaning altitudes exceeding 26,000 feet.
   One of 14 mountains on Earth that have summits this high, Everest
   wreaks havoc on the human body. Early symptoms of altitude’s effects
   include dizziness, sluggishness, nausea, and fainting. If symptoms are
   left untreated, they quickly cascade, with increasingly dire
   consequences to climbers as air is choked out of their bodies. Even
   below the death zone, altitude can have serious repercussions.

   The best way to mitigate the risk of high altitude climbing is to
   increase the amount of oxygen in a climber’s blood. Climbers can do
   this in a number of ways. One is to spend extensive time acclimatizing
   to high elevation along their chosen route. They can also use drugs
   like acetazolamide or dexamethasone, which reduce a variety of
   altitudinal conditions.

   Perhaps the most controversial course of action, though, is the
   decision to carry and use supplemental O[2]. Most climbers consider
   their supplemental oxygen as equipment—just as much a part of their
   experience as their Gore-Tex gear, and certainly as foundational as
   their extensive training.^1

Top 10 Design Flaws in the Human Body

   But using supplemental oxygen sounds vaguely like doping. In fact,
   prominent elements of alpine climbing culture see it as illegitimate.
   Famous professional climbers like Ed Viesturs, the only American to
   have climbed all 14 8,000-meter peaks,^1 deride the use of supplemental
   oxygen and have for decades.^2 Using it, they maintain, is indeed like
   doping—with all the associated stigma heaped on it. “It brings the
   mountain down to your level,” Veisturs writes. “I don’t want that. If I
   have to train harder or suffer more, then so be it.”^3

   Another elite alpinist, Cory Richards, said in an interview with
   National Geographic in April of this year that climbing without oxygen
   was a way of advancing the sport. “[It] is one of those things that
   amounts to adhering to our highest standard,” Richards reasoned when
   asked about his upcoming attempt at Everest sans O[2]. “Rather than
   just bringing people up to the curve, it’s about bringing the whole
   curve up. The more people who climb Everest without oxygen, the less
   oxygen we will see on this mountain.”^3

     All high altitude climbers are at risk of irreversible brain damage
     as a result of oxygen-starved environments.

   By one reading of world anti-doping rules, they have a point. The World
   Anti-Doping Association (WADA) prohibits an athlete from using a
   substance that fulfills two of the following three criteria: 1) It is
   performance-enhancing; 2) It is harmful to health; 3) It runs counter
   to the spirit of the sport. If elite alpinists like Viesturs and
   Richards are successful in convincing the broader alpinism culture,
   then oxygen would satisfy two of these three criteria.

   Similarly, the United States Anti-Doping Agency 2016 athlete guide
   specifically prohibits “enhancing the uptake, transport, or delivery of
   oxygen,” whether it is by blood doping, intravenous manipulation of the
   contents of blood, or other means. Substances that help the body
   process or transport oxygen, like erythropoietin, are likewise banned.
   By these rules, carrying an O[2] tank with you on an ascent certainly
   raises questions.

   The only problem is that, for most, climbing without supplemental O[2]
   dramatically increases the risk of death.

   On June 23, 1802, explorer Alexander von Humboldt began an ascent of
   Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.  Climbing with naturalist Aimé Bonpland
   and local Quito student Carlos Montufar, von Humboldt scaled to a
   19th-century record altitude of 19,286 feet, and experienced what he
   described as nausea and stomach cramping.^4 His team returned with
   bloodshot eyes, and bleeding gums and lips.

   Von Humboldt’s account of his experience is one of the first systematic
   descriptions by a climber and naturalist of high altitude’s utterly
   debilitating effects on human physiology. It came after centuries of
   investigation by natural philosophers, from Aristotle to Robert Hooke
   to Paul Bert, into the effect of air on living organisms.^5

   Where von Humboldt’s team was perplexed by their symptoms, today,
   climbers are well-educated that these are early signs of what can lead
   to serious complications.^4 Contemporary medical researchers call what
   the Humboldt team experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS). While its
   causes are not fully understood, cerebral swelling, vasodilation, and
   alteration of the blood-brain barrier may all be involved.^6 Effects of
   AMS can be felt as low as 8,000 feet.

   Untreated, the symptoms of AMS will progress, ultimately resulting in
   conditions like high altitude pulmonary edema, in which fluid
   accumulates in the lungs, or high altitude cerebral edema, in which the
   brain swells and pushes against the skull, causing a loss of
   coordination, coma, and eventually death. The progression of symptoms
   can be fast, sometimes within 48 hours. Those who suffer from high
   altitude cerebral edema can take weeks to recover, even if they receive
   treatment.

     The really unforgivable offense in the alpine climbing community is
     to lie about the conditions of an ascent.

   In an attempt to quantify the neurological effects of high-altitude
   climbing, doctors Nicolas Fayed, Pedro Modrego, and Humberto Morales
   compiled a series of brain scans of 35 alpinists before and after
   ascents of Everest (29,029 feet), Aconcagua (22,840 feet), Mont Blanc
   (15,776 feet), and Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet). The authors’ findings,
   published in 2006, were sobering.^7

   They concluded that all high altitude climbers are at risk of
   irreversible brain damage as a result of time spent in oxygen-starved
   environments. The simple act of climbing at elevations with reduced
   oxygen increased the risk of brain damage, even with time spent
   acclimatizing before ascent. Everyone from alpinists who classified
   themselves as amateurs and were climbing at the relatively “low
   elevations” of Mont Blanc to seasoned professionals on Everest showed
   the effects of climbing at extreme elevations, ranging from symptoms
   associated with high altitude sickness to subcortical irreversible
   lesions. Even climbers who show no symptoms have displayed
   neurophysiological changes. “Climbers are paying [for their routes],”
   science writer R. Douglas Fields summarized in 2008, “with brain
   tissue.”^8

   Oxygen is the fuel that powers our bodies—the more fuel, the better we
   perform. Not enough oxygen and the body shuts down. We’ve known the
   risks and tradeoffs of oxygen deprivation at least since Tenzing Norgay
   and Edmund Hillary’s first ascent of Everest in 1953—with supplemental
   oxygen. When alpinists Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler climbed
   Everest without supplemental oxygen in May of 1978, they effectively
   raised the bar in the community of alpine climbing. Even though
   estimates put only about 200 of Everest’s 4,000 successful ascents as
   summits without oxygen, that high-water remark remains. Some, inspired
   by Messner and Habeler’s ascent, feel that climbing without O2
   represents the best of their sporting ethos, even if—especially if—that
   means that those sporting standards are high, never mind the risk.

   The discussion extends beyond oxygen. Climbers also rely on a variety
   of drugs to help speed acclimatization to assist with their ascent.
   Acetazolamide (also known as Diamox) and dexamethasone (dex) are common
   artificial acclimatizers that help accelerate adjustment to altitude.
   Diamox blocks carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme that regulates how the
   body converts CO[2] to bicarbonate, and dex stops capillaries from
   leaking. Both can be life-saving, and are recommended as immediate
   treatment for high-altitude edemas.^1

   They are also prohibited in other, non-climbing sports. Acetazolamide,
   for example, is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Diuretics, like
   acetazolamide, have been forbidden in competitive athletics since 1988,
   since they can easily remove fluid from the body, causing one to
   experience rapid weight loss—significant for sports where athletes
   complete in specific weight categories. They can also be used to mask
   the presence of other, banned doping agents by increasing urine volume.

   The U.S. anti-doping agency, WADA, and the Olympic committee have all
   not weighed in on the question of doping in alpinism. That’s because,
   while various governing bodies monitor and police other sports,
   alpinism is primarily internally regulated. It does have the
   International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, but this is a
   very loose governing body. Consequently, what is and is not doping in
   alpinism does not fall under global regulations. Instead, these
   questions are actively debated and reflected in the sport’s evolving
   ethics and practices.

   As a result, the real ethical line in the alpine climbing community
   doesn’t hinge on the questions of “oxygen” or “not oxygen” or even
   “dex” or “not dex,” but in the narrative that a climber builds about
   her ascent. “The world of cutting edge alpinism is small. Reputation is
   everything,” climber Gregory Crouch, the author of Enduring Patagonia,
   explains. “Climbers pushing that edge are not going to be impressed
   with someone dawdling up Everest, sucking on an oxygen bottle. Climbing
   a route in that style is kinda beneath contempt. It’s not worth
   noticing. What really matters in the world of real climbers is what you
   climb and how you climb it.”

   Sports ethicist Verner Møller explains that it wasn’t always this way.
   “In the early days of alpinism, whatever could take you to the top was
   acceptable, because it was such a massive, physical challenge to climb
   such high elevations,” he says. “What we see now, however, is people
   saying, ‘This is not the right way to get to the top—you should not be
   able to use supplemental oxygen or other medicines.’ That’s a very
   purist approach to the activity.” The narrative has changed.

   On its most fundamental level the really unforgivable offense in the
   alpine climbing community is to lie about the conditions of an ascent.
   In other words, claiming an ascent without oxygen if, in fact, a
   climber used it; or alluding to a dex-free climb, if, in reality, the
   drug helped accelerate an acclimatization. Because alpine climbing is
   removed from the arena of global competition—there aren’t Olympic teams
   of alpine climbers—the community isn’t trying to create a “level
   playing field” the way that other sports engineer an equal environment
   for competition. Climbing’s self-regulation—whether through shaming or
   ego—moves the discussion from ethics to aesthetics.

   We see other sports differently. There, doping crosses a bright line,
   and is seen as clearly immoral. But the example of alpinism pulls at
   this confident appraisal. It reminds us that, even in the case of
   Armstrong or A-Rod, we object to doping because it violates a narrative
   about the sport. In his book The Ethics of Doping and Anti-Doping,
   Møller argues that “the doping problem has been constructed as a form
   of narrative blurring fact and fiction.” In other words, it is hard to
   have a sophisticated discussion of doping, because so much of the
   debate hinges on the moral story about it that society builds. This, he
   writes, has been accompanied by a uniform response to the issue,
   usually on the anti-doping side. “Only in very rare cases have athletes
   questioned the wisdom inherent in the actual anti-doping policy, and
   when it has happened they have been strongly opposed by sports’ leaders
   and fellow athletes.”^9

   Djokovic’s hyperbaric chamber is legit, but many players can’t possibly
   get access to one. Is that cheating? Conversely, treating supplemental
   oxygen as a performance-enhancing drug rather than a tool seems to be
   on par with asking Tour-de-France riders or NFL players to compete
   without their helmets. “If purists are to be consistent in their
   argument,” says Moller, “they should argue that one should not be
   allowed to go to the top of the mountain with one’s clothes
   on—alpinists’ clothes are incredible technologies in and of
   themselves—or have any kind of gear. That would be a truly pure
   ascent.”

   As the oxygen debate in elite alpinism continues—and if history tells
   us anything, it’s that it will—alpinists will continue to consider and
   reconsider just how much of their physical selves they’re willing
   sacrifice in the name of their sporting ethos and climbing aesthetics.
   These types of conversations happen far less often in other sports.
   Maybe that should change. Alpinism’s approach to oxygen—as contentious
   and complicated as it is—gives us a model for an ethics that is
   flexible and evolutionary.

       As originally published, this article erroneously stated that these
       peaks are 8,000 feet high. The 14 peaks in question are all above

The Paradox of Doping in Mountain Climbing

In alpinism, supplemental oxygen is a matter of safety—but some say it’s
doping.

   We’re usually comfortable deciding whether or not an athlete is doping.
   Lance Armstrong was definitely doping by using erythropoietin. Tennis
   player Novak Djokovic, on the other hand, was definitely not doping
   when he slept in an egg-shaped barometric chamber.

   We tell one from the other by a kind of cultural gestalt, sorting out
   those who dope and those who don’t. Then we take that one step farther
   and reason: Those who don’t, compete cleanly—those that do, cheat.

   But what if a substance is both performance-enhancing and a benefit to
   an athlete’s health? What if that substance is oxygen?
   Not doping: Some athletes use a barometric chamber like this one to
   help prepare for competition. Despite its direct effect on their
   physiology, it is not banned or regulated.Daniella Zalcman

   The top of Everest is in what the Swiss alpinist Edouard Wyss-Dunant
   nicknamed the “death zone,” meaning altitudes exceeding 26,000 feet.
   One of 14 mountains on Earth that have summits this high, Everest
   wreaks havoc on the human body. Early symptoms of altitude’s effects
   include dizziness, sluggishness, nausea, and fainting. If symptoms are
   left untreated, they quickly cascade, with increasingly dire
   consequences to climbers as air is choked out of their bodies. Even
   below the death zone, altitude can have serious repercussions.

   The best way to mitigate the risk of high altitude climbing is to
   increase the amount of oxygen in a climber’s blood. Climbers can do
   this in a number of ways. One is to spend extensive time acclimatizing
   to high elevation along their chosen route. They can also use drugs
   like acetazolamide or dexamethasone, which reduce a variety of
   altitudinal conditions.

   Perhaps the most controversial course of action, though, is the
   decision to carry and use supplemental O[2]. Most climbers consider
   their supplemental oxygen as equipment—just as much a part of their
   experience as their Gore-Tex gear, and certainly as foundational as
   their extensive training.^1

   But using supplemental oxygen sounds vaguely like doping. In fact,
   prominent elements of alpine climbing culture see it as illegitimate.
   Famous professional climbers like Ed Viesturs, the only American to
   have climbed all 14 8,000-meter peaks,^1 deride the use of supplemental
   oxygen and have for decades.^2 Using it, they maintain, is indeed like
   doping—with all the associated stigma heaped on it. “It brings the
   mountain down to your level,” Veisturs writes. “I don’t want that. If I
   have to train harder or suffer more, then so be it.”^3

   Another elite alpinist, Cory Richards, said in an interview with
   National Geographic in April of this year that climbing without oxygen
   was a way of advancing the sport. “[It] is one of those things that
   amounts to adhering to our highest standard,” Richards reasoned when
   asked about his upcoming attempt at Everest sans O[2]. “Rather than
   just bringing people up to the curve, it’s about bringing the whole
   curve up. The more people who climb Everest without oxygen, the less
   oxygen we will see on this mountain.”^3

     All high altitude climbers are at risk of irreversible brain damage
     as a result of oxygen-starved environments.

   By one reading of world anti-doping rules, they have a point. The World
   Anti-Doping Association (WADA) prohibits an athlete from using a
   substance that fulfills two of the following three criteria: 1) It is
   performance-enhancing; 2) It is harmful to health; 3) It runs counter
   to the spirit of the sport. If elite alpinists like Viesturs and
   Richards are successful in convincing the broader alpinism culture,
   then oxygen would satisfy two of these three criteria.

   Similarly, the United States Anti-Doping Agency 2016 athlete guide
   specifically prohibits “enhancing the uptake, transport, or delivery of
   oxygen,” whether it is by blood doping, intravenous manipulation of the
   contents of blood, or other means. Substances that help the body
   process or transport oxygen, like erythropoietin, are likewise banned.
   By these rules, carrying an O[2] tank with you on an ascent certainly
   raises questions.

   The only problem is that, for most, climbing without supplemental O[2]
   dramatically increases the risk of death.

   ascended the mountain without supplemental oxygen in 1978, creating a

   On June 23, 1802, explorer Alexander von Humboldt began an ascent of
   Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.  Climbing with naturalist Aimé Bonpland
   and local Quito student Carlos Montufar, von Humboldt scaled to a
   19th-century record altitude of 19,286 feet, and experienced what he
   described as nausea and stomach cramping.^4 His team returned with
   bloodshot eyes, and bleeding gums and lips.

   Von Humboldt’s account of his experience is one of the first systematic
   descriptions by a climber and naturalist of high altitude’s utterly
   debilitating effects on human physiology. It came after centuries of
   investigation by natural philosophers, from Aristotle to Robert Hooke
   to Paul Bert, into the effect of air on living organisms.^5

   Where von Humboldt’s team was perplexed by their symptoms, today,
   climbers are well-educated that these are early signs of what can lead
   to serious complications.^4 Contemporary medical researchers call what
   the Humboldt team experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS). While its
   causes are not fully understood, cerebral swelling, vasodilation, and
   alteration of the blood-brain barrier may all be involved.^6 Effects of
   AMS can be felt as low as 8,000 feet.

   Untreated, the symptoms of AMS will progress, ultimately resulting in
   conditions like high altitude pulmonary edema, in which fluid
   accumulates in the lungs, or high altitude cerebral edema, in which the
   brain swells and pushes against the skull, causing a loss of
   coordination, coma, and eventually death. The progression of symptoms
   can be fast, sometimes within 48 hours. Those who suffer from high
   altitude cerebral edema can take weeks to recover, even if they receive
   treatment.

     The really unforgivable offense in the alpine climbing community is
     to lie about the conditions of an ascent.

   In an attempt to quantify the neurological effects of high-altitude
   climbing, doctors Nicolas Fayed, Pedro Modrego, and Humberto Morales
   compiled a series of brain scans of 35 alpinists before and after
   ascents of Everest (29,029 feet), Aconcagua (22,840 feet), Mont Blanc
   (15,776 feet), and Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet). The authors’ findings,
   published in 2006, were sobering.^7

   They concluded that all high altitude climbers are at risk of
   irreversible brain damage as a result of time spent in oxygen-starved
   environments. The simple act of climbing at elevations with reduced
   oxygen increased the risk of brain damage, even with time spent
   acclimatizing before ascent. Everyone from alpinists who classified
   themselves as amateurs and were climbing at the relatively “low
   elevations” of Mont Blanc to seasoned professionals on Everest showed
   the effects of climbing at extreme elevations, ranging from symptoms
   associated with high altitude sickness to subcortical irreversible
   lesions. Even climbers who show no symptoms have displayed
   neurophysiological changes. “Climbers are paying [for their routes],”
   science writer R. Douglas Fields summarized in 2008, “with brain
   tissue.”^8

   Oxygen is the fuel that powers our bodies—the more fuel, the better we
   perform. Not enough oxygen and the body shuts down. We’ve known the
   risks and tradeoffs of oxygen deprivation at least since Tenzing Norgay
   and Edmund Hillary’s first ascent of Everest in 1953—with supplemental
   oxygen. When alpinists Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler climbed
   Everest without supplemental oxygen in May of 1978, they effectively
   raised the bar in the community of alpine climbing. Even though
   estimates put only about 200 of Everest’s 4,000 successful ascents as
   summits without oxygen, that high-water remark remains. Some, inspired
   by Messner and Habeler’s ascent, feel that climbing without O2
   represents the best of their sporting ethos, even if—especially if—that
   means that those sporting standards are high, never mind the risk.

   The discussion extends beyond oxygen. Climbers also rely on a variety
   of drugs to help speed acclimatization to assist with their ascent.
   Acetazolamide (also known as Diamox) and dexamethasone (dex) are common
   artificial acclimatizers that help accelerate adjustment to altitude.
   Diamox blocks carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme that regulates how the
   body converts CO[2] to bicarbonate, and dex stops capillaries from
   leaking. Both can be life-saving, and are recommended as immediate
   treatment for high-altitude edemas.^1

   They are also prohibited in other, non-climbing sports. Acetazolamide,
   for example, is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Diuretics, like
   acetazolamide, have been forbidden in competitive athletics since 1988,
   since they can easily remove fluid from the body, causing one to
   experience rapid weight loss—significant for sports where athletes
   complete in specific weight categories. They can also be used to mask
   the presence of other, banned doping agents by increasing urine volume.

   The U.S. anti-doping agency, WADA, and the Olympic committee have all
   not weighed in on the question of doping in alpinism. That’s because,
   while various governing bodies monitor and police other sports,
   alpinism is primarily internally regulated. It does have the
   International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, but this is a
   very loose governing body. Consequently, what is and is not doping in
   alpinism does not fall under global regulations. Instead, these
   questions are actively debated and reflected in the sport’s evolving
   ethics and practices.

   As a result, the real ethical line in the alpine climbing community
   doesn’t hinge on the questions of “oxygen” or “not oxygen” or even
   “dex” or “not dex,” but in the narrative that a climber builds about
   her ascent. “The world of cutting edge alpinism is small. Reputation is
   everything,” climber Gregory Crouch, the author of Enduring Patagonia,
   explains. “Climbers pushing that edge are not going to be impressed
   with someone dawdling up Everest, sucking on an oxygen bottle. Climbing
   a route in that style is kinda beneath contempt. It’s not worth
   noticing. What really matters in the world of real climbers is what you
   climb and how you climb it.”

   Sports ethicist Verner Møller explains that it wasn’t always this way.
   “In the early days of alpinism, whatever could take you to the top was
   acceptable, because it was such a massive, physical challenge to climb
   such high elevations,” he says. “What we see now, however, is people
   saying, ‘This is not the right way to get to the top—you should not be
   able to use supplemental oxygen or other medicines.’ That’s a very
   purist approach to the activity.” The narrative has changed.

   On its most fundamental level the really unforgivable offense in the
   alpine climbing community is to lie about the conditions of an ascent.
   In other words, claiming an ascent without oxygen if, in fact, a
   climber used it; or alluding to a dex-free climb, if, in reality, the
   drug helped accelerate an acclimatization. Because alpine climbing is
   removed from the arena of global competition—there aren’t Olympic teams
   of alpine climbers—the community isn’t trying to create a “level
   playing field” the way that other sports engineer an equal environment
   for competition. Climbing’s self-regulation—whether through shaming or
   ego—moves the discussion from ethics to aesthetics.

   We see other sports differently. There, doping crosses a bright line,
   and is seen as clearly immoral. But the example of alpinism pulls at
   this confident appraisal. It reminds us that, even in the case of
   Armstrong or A-Rod, we object to doping because it violates a narrative
   about the sport. In his book The Ethics of Doping and Anti-Doping,
   Møller argues that “the doping problem has been constructed as a form
   of narrative blurring fact and fiction.” In other words, it is hard to
   have a sophisticated discussion of doping, because so much of the
   debate hinges on the moral story about it that society builds. This, he
   writes, has been accompanied by a uniform response to the issue,
   usually on the anti-doping side. “Only in very rare cases have athletes
   questioned the wisdom inherent in the actual anti-doping policy, and
   when it has happened they have been strongly opposed by sports’ leaders
   and fellow athletes.”^9

   Djokovic’s hyperbaric chamber is legit, but many players can’t possibly
   get access to one. Is that cheating? Conversely, treating supplemental
   oxygen as a performance-enhancing drug rather than a tool seems to be
   on par with asking Tour-de-France riders or NFL players to compete
   without their helmets. “If purists are to be consistent in their
   argument,” says Moller, “they should argue that one should not be
   allowed to go to the top of the mountain with one’s clothes
   on—alpinists’ clothes are incredible technologies in and of
   themselves—or have any kind of gear. That would be a truly pure
   ascent.”

   As the oxygen debate in elite alpinism continues—and if history tells
   us anything, it’s that it will—alpinists will continue to consider and
   reconsider just how much of their physical selves they’re willing
   sacrifice in the name of their sporting ethos and climbing aesthetics.
   These types of conversations happen far less often in other sports.
   Maybe that should change. Alpinism’s approach to oxygen—as contentious
   and complicated as it is—gives us a model for an ethics that is
   flexible and evolutionary.

   archaeology and paleoanthropology.

    1. Correction
       As originally published, this article erroneously stated that these
       peaks are 8,000 feet high. The 14 peaks in question are all above
       8,000 meters.
