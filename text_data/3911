Our Second Birth Story

   WrenBirthStory3

   Hello there! How has it already been 2.5 months since our little Wren
   was born?

   If you remember Bowie's birth story, this one was also like something
   out of the movies. It's how we do things around here. The birth was so
   quick (3 hours) that Hal almost missed it! I still laugh about how
   nothing made it out of my bag - no candles, crystals, essential oils or
   Hypnobabies this time around. But I'll take fast and furious over long
   and laborious any day. Makes for a great story, that's for sure. And
   we're fortunate that we had someone there to help me tell it to you
   today - our birth photographer, Whitney Hardie.

   Birth photography was not on my list of must-haves going into this
   pregnancy. In all honesty, I was extremely hesitant about letting a
   stranger document such raw and intimate moments. Would her camera
   clicking distract me? Would I feel self-conscious? Would the images
   scar our children for life? But as soon as we met for an initial
   consultation, Whitney and I connected instantly and her warm and
   calming presence put me at ease. All my concerns were addressed and as
   promised, she was an absolute ninja. I barely even noticed she was in
   the delivery room. And the final images? You'll see below - they speak
   for themselves. They still make me emotional. I love being able to
   re-live this once in a lifetime event. And seeing your birth from
   someone else's perspective is quite amazing - like an out-of-body
   experience. We're so happy to have had these memories preserved. I only
   wish Whitney was with us for Bowie's birth as well! Pregnant friends,
   if you're on the fence about hiring a birth photographer, do it.
   Seattle mamas-to-be, Whitney is your gal.

   So here we go. My darling Wren, below is the beautiful story of how we
   met...

   ...

   You were due on January 2nd. I was hoping for a New Year's Day baby
   because it was a full super moon on the 1st. You know me, I'm silly
   about that kind of stuff. At the very least, I was determined to have
   you after Christmas (who wants to compete with Jesus?) But on December
   22, 2017, at just under 38 weeks, you came knocking on my door. I woke
   up around 5am with what I thought were Braxton Hicks contractions. I'd
   had them throughout the third trimester, frightening me with each
   tightening of my uterus. Since your brother Bowie was 1 month
   premature, I was extremely anxious about going into labor early again.
   Although I was considered full term, I still wasn't mentally ready
   (would I ever have been?) With each contraction, I told you, "no, no,
   not today baby, not today." You must have been giggling inside. I
   drifted in and out of sleep until around 7am when the pressure waves
   felt regular, so I began to time them. They were 10 minutes apart. This
   was all new to me, since Bowie's labor started with my water
   breaking. What did 10 minutes apart really mean?

   I woke up your Papa, told him the news, and got into the shower to see
   if the hot water would slow things down. It didn't. I could barely
   stand up in the stall. As soon as I got out, I called my midwife. Since
   second births happen quicker, she said I should come into the hospital.
   I naively asked her if the contractions were possibly a false alarm?
   She chuckled and said "no, you're having a baby today!" Eek! I got
   dressed, dried my hair, and threw a few last minute items into my bag.
   Standing up and walking around sped things up considerably. I was
   doubled over in pain every 30 seconds or so. It didn't even occur to me
   that the time between my contractions would increase and intensify so
   rapidly.

   Meanwhile, your Papa called my folks to start their 1.5 hour drive up
   to Seattle. He called Whitney, so she could meet us at the hospital.
   Then he got busy getting Bowie fed and dressed. We planned to leave him
   with my brother who lives in the neighborhood, but they were in Hawaii
   and we foolishly didn't have a back-up plan. Total parent fail! In
   hindsight, we should have dropped him off with a neighbor, but we
   figured your grandparents would get to the hospital in time to take him
   while I labored. Famous last words.

   Once we got in the car, it seemed as though my contractions were
   happening every 15 seconds. I had to unbuckle my seatbelt, lean forward
   into the dashboard and breathe through them with all the concentration
   I could muster. I remember saying to Papa, "you're going to need to
   drive a lot faster!" Poor Bowie was probably so confused. Papa
   explained to him that you were on your way and Mama was going to be
   okay. At one point, I truly thought I was going to give birth in the
   car. BUT we made it to the hospital. Papa carried Bowie along with all
   our bags, while I trailed behind, stopping to breathe through a
   contraction every few feet. We rushed up the elevator to the delivery
   ward and the nurses directed me to a room. I waddled in, changed into a
   birthing gown and immediately climbed into the bed. Bowie was chatting
   up a storm so I asked Hal to take him outside. I needed silence. And I
   couldn't bear to have him see me in so much pain.

   They left the room as my midwife came in to greet me, strap on a
   monitor and check my cervix. I was 6 cm dilated. She left to go get a
   birthing ball while the nurses asked me all sorts of annoying questions
   and tried to insert the saline lock into my arm. But there was no time
   for stillness in between contractions. As soon as one pressure wave
   ended, the next one began. Then it happened - I felt the strong urge to
   poo. I remembered this sensation all too well from Bowie's birth and
   knew exactly what it meant. You were ready. You were coming.

   My midwife came back and checked my cervix. I asked if could push,
   dreading the thought of holding you in like I had to with Bowie. But
   she gave me the green light and I was so relieved! Someone asked if I
   wanted your Papa in the room. I said "YES! GO GET HIM!" A nurse raced
   out to the waiting area, gave Bowie a piece of chocolate, and told Papa
   to RUN! He arrived just as I began to push you out.

   He cheered me on as I crushed his hand with my grip. I was so eager to
   see you, my midwife had to remind me to only push during the
   contractions! About 2 pushes in, my mom arrived, right as your head was
   crowning. Then one final push!

   My midwife caught you and immediately placed your tiny purple body
   below mine. I looked down into your familiar eyes and weeped.
   WrenBirthStory25

   YOU'RE HERE.

   WrenBirthStory27

   They flipped me over and I got to hold you on my chest, skin to skin.
   The most magical feeling in the world.

   WrenBirthStory29

   My placenta was delivered soon after and my midwife sewed up a very
   minor tear as you instinctively made your way to my breast for your
   very first feed.

   WrenBirthStory30

   WrenBirthStory37

   Your papa was so happy he made it in time.

   WrenBirthStory31

   WrenBirthStory32

   And he couldn't wait to bring your brother into the room to meet you.
   Bowie was in awe of your tiny nose and mouth, that looked so similar to
   his own.

   WrenBirthStory33

   WrenBirthStory34

   WrenBirthStory35

   WrenBirthStory38

   We named you Wren for a few reasons. Papa chose it because one of his
   favorite drummers is Alan "Reni" Wren from The Stone Roses. I loved the
   name because the wren is considered the most sacred bird in many
   cultures, particularly to the Druids. It symbolizes wisdom and healing.
   Around the New Year, an apprentice Druid would go out by himself into
   the woods and if he found a wren, it was a sign that he would be
   blessed with knowledge in the coming year. The wren is a very tiny bird
   with a big voice. The wren's elusiveness is a metaphor for finding
   divinity within all things. Your middle name, Keone (pronounced
   key-own-ee), is Hawaiian for land/sand/earth. We felt it went perfectly
   with Bowie's middle name, Ocean.

   The next day, the hospital photographer stopped by to take a few sweet
   portraits of you and all of us together at last....

Our New Year Birth Announcements from Tiny Prints / Shutterfly

   2017NewYearCard

   Hi friends! For those of you don't follow me on Instagram... we had our
   baby! Meet Wren. He's a pretty cool little man, currently asleep in my
   arms as I type with one hand. Birth story coming soon!

   Since he arrived smack dab in the midst of the holiday frenzy, we
   decided to combine both events and send out a New Year birth
   announcement instead of our usual holiday cards. I partnered yet again
   with Tiny Prints / Shutterfly, because they make the process so
   incredibly easy. I churned them out in a matter of minutes, which is so
   very necessary as a sleep-deprived new mama of two. I chose a clean and
   simple Allie Munroe design, uploaded our newborn hospital photos, and
   had the addresses pre-printed on matching envelopes. When they arrived
   to our house just a few days later, I attached the personalized postage
   stamps of Wren's sweet sleeping face and into the mail they went. Done
   and done.

   Yeah, it's mid-January. But I always say, it's never too late to send
   New Year cards. In fact, this is a really good time because your
   friends and family will have already cleared out everyone else's cards
   and you'll have prime real estate on their fridge!

   P.S. See our past holiday cards here - 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012,
   2010 and 2009.

And Then There Were Four

   BigBrotherBowie1000

   Our baby boy is going to be a big brother! To another baby boy! I still
   can't quite believe it myself. Since it took us 3 years to conceive
   Bowie, I (wrongly) assumed it would take a very long time to get
   pregnant (and stay pregnant) again. Especially with my "advanced
   maternal age". But it happened during our very first month of trying,
   and we weren't even on fertility meds. We were shocked. And terrified.
   Still are! But excited beyond belief.

   This baby seems to be very serious about joining us earth side. It's
   been a smooth pregnancy so far. He's been enduring all sorts of feats,
   including one bad car accident and one crazy toddler jumping / crashing
   / climbing on my belly. Despite some extreme fatigue - which could be
   related to chasing around a high energy 22-month old - I've been
   feeling wonderful. And pretty darn lucky.

   Here are a few fun outtakes of this photoshoot with Bowie. Which only
   took about a gazillion snaps to get right!

Modernica Case Study Bentwood Tray Table Giveaway!

   ModernicaGiveaway1


   My second Mother's Day as a mother was simple and sweet. The boys
   started it off right with breakfast in bed. Believe it or not, this was
   the first breakfast in bed I've ever received in this house... because
   we never had a tray table to serve it on! It was always on the "one
   day" list. Until Modernica came to the rescue. We received their Case
   Study Bentwood Tray Table just in time for Mother's Day.

   Design nuts that we are, Hal and I are obsessed with practically
   everything Modernica makes. Especially their bentwood products, which
   are built and molded right there in their Los Angeles factory. The tray
   table is a work of art - it's absolutely gorgeous. Sleek, smooth and
   minimalistic. Bowie was also pleased that it doubles as a step stool
   and toddler bench, just his size - which I fully plan to incorporate
   into his future big boy room.

   Fellow bentwood lovers, I have good news - you can get 15% off
   ALL bentwood products, until May 31st!

   AND... you can win a tray table of your own! I'm thrilled to be able to
   give one of these beauties away to a lucky reader ($135 value). Choose
   between two colors - ash (shown) or walnut. I'm hosting the giveaway
   over on Instagram, so meet me there!

   Instructions:
    1. Follow me on Instagram
    2. Leave a comment there with your ideal breakfast in bed
    3. Leave a second comment there, tagging a friend

   (Free shipping to the US only).

   I'll be announcing a winner a week from today, on Thursday, May 25th.
   Good luck, loves!
