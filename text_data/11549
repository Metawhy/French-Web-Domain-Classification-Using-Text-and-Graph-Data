Great game production tips with Grant Shonkwiler - GDC Podcast ep. 1

   By Staff | August 15, 2019
   [gdconfgdcpodcast.png]

   Grant Shonkwiler is a rising star of video game production, having
   worked on games including Doom, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and
   Fortnite. He joined Gamasutra editor-in-chief Kris Graft and news
   editor Alissa McAloon on the newly-minted GDC Podcast.

   Listen now on iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify

   Shonkwiler, who recently joined GDC's advisory board and runs his own
   consultancy, Shonkventures, allowed us to pick his large brain about
   being an effective leader and producer. He also talked to us about
   going on sabbatical and becoming a farmer…Here are some highlights.

   GDC Podcast music by Mike Meehan.

"Shonk" on crunch

   I think [a producer's role in regards to crunch] is about helping teams
   understand why it exists, more than it is to eliminate it. I think that
   is often a goal – “let’s eliminate crunch” – but what I can help [you
   do] is not just straight eliminate crunch, but help you understand why
   crunch exists.

   IFRAME: https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/40uR30JgJZ0SmrOmYZfV7Y

   ...Usually [overwork] isn’t about deadlines. It’s about mis-scoping…you
   get to a point where you’re like, “I can’t cut anything.” Ok, but can
   we limit things just a little bit? Can we focus on things differently,
   and understand that? As producers, it’s our responsibility to make sure
   our team doesn’t have to crunch or overwork, ever. So if we get to a
   point where [our teams] are doing that, then ultimately we’ve failed. I
   know that can sound a little bit harsh…but we have to kind of stand up
   [to higher-ups] and say “No, this is the cost – the human cost – of
   what we’re doing, and here’s possible solutions and ways to work
   through that.”

On the most important parts of being a good producer

   The most important thing…is your communication skills. You have to be
   able to communicate with people at their level and in their language. I
   recommend all my junior producers to learn a little bit about coding,
   learn a little bit about design, art. I’m not asking them to become
   those things, but at least be able to speak the language.

   I often tell them to do the thing I do, which is like, “I’m not a
   senior artist – can you explain to me like I’m five [years old] what
   mipmaps are,” or whatever it might be. You want start to progress to
   the point where you’re not interrupting meetings because you don’t
   understand. So communication is the first one.

   The second one is just understanding that people are people, and that
   is ultimately our job. Our job is people first. So focus on people and
   make sure they have everything they need. Another thing I tell people
   when they become producers or junior producers is, “Congratulations,
   you’re now the lowest of the low.” People think producers are high up
   at companies because we’re the people doing a lot of [press] interviews
   and stuff. That’s actually because the important people can’t stop
   working to come do the interviews!

   So I say our job is anything from getting coffee to making big
   decisions. And we do that for everybody, even if they’re considered
   more junior than us on the org chart. I tell people in a lot of ways,
   you’re a servant, you’re a butler, and you’re also a little bit of a
   camp counselor, because people come to you and complain.

   Those are the core basics. If people can understand that, I can teach
   them how to be at least a decent leader…If you’re not a good
   communicator and you don’t understand people on a basic level, then
   you’re really going to struggle to be a producer.

On common production mistakes

   The first common mistake that I see from people is this over-strict
   adherence to rules that they’ve created in their own brain. What I mean
   by that is like, “We have to be by the letter with scrum or agile, and
   we have to make sure that we’re doing this.” And that tends to be to
   the detriment of the team. If we go back to what I said are the core
   tenets of being a producer, which is about communicating and being this
   facilitator and a person who’s focused on people, scrum and agile tend
   to cause a lot of problems when they first come in, and people get
   angry and frustrated.

   What I say is…we call it “beachheading” a new practice, where you take
   a small group of people, and you have them learn that practice, and
   they can change it based on your studio culture. Then they are your
   champions bring it out to the rest of the team. So that’s one of the
   main things I tend to see, is that people are like, “we decided to
   become agile, and here’s our super-strict ruleset,” and they bring it
   in and everything breaks, then everybody’s heads are on fire.

   …The main thing that I usually help my clients focus on is making sure
   that the team understands why changes are being made, making sure the
   team understands the goals of that, and then making sure the team
   actually understands what they want out of these changes.

Choice design with Zachtronics' Matthew Burns - GDC Podcast ep. 2

   By Staff | September 11, 2019
   [gdconfgdcpodcast_0.png]

   After years of working on Halo, Call of Duty, and other triple-A
   franchises, Matthew Burns went the independent route and has now, with
   Zachtronics, released the arresting visual novel Eliza, a story about
   the ethical conflicts surrounding an AI therapy program.

   Listen now on iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify

   Matthew joins Gamasutra's Kris Graft and Alissa McAloon on the
   newly-minted GDC Podcast to chat about how a game with so little room
   for choice was brilliantly designed to say so much about player agency.
   And yes, we just called a visual novel a game, but only because Matthew
   gave us permission to.

   GDC Podcast music by Mike Meehan.

Matthew on choices in games

   "I think any textbook that you open about game design will basically
   say, 'games are different because they're interactive. Games are
   different from other mediums because they present you with choices.'
   That's the defining feature of games. Any pundit talking about games
   will say this.

   "And so, what's so powerful to me in that is actually denying someone a
   choice. That can be such a powerful move, because it's a game and you
   would think that you would want to give people a choice. And so going
   against that is a really interesting way to use the tools that you have
   as a game designer. It's like using silence as a composer or blank
   space as a writer.

   "But the absence of the thing that makes the medium what it is can
   enhance the other choices that come later."

Games as a series of interesting decisions

   "I actually don't agree with that, that a game is a series of
   interesting [decisions]. I think that what a game is is actually very
   difficult to define...Ludwig Wittgenstein picked the word "game" as an
   example of a word that is impossible to define, and he had all these
   examples of why or how you can't define the word 'game.' It's worth
   reading.

   "Everyone has their own definition of 'game.' A lot of people think
   visual novels are not games at all. But I think that Eliza does have
   interesting choices in it -- or at least one interesting choice in it.
   So if Eliza is a series of one very interesting choice, is it a game or
   not? I don't know, I'll let you decide -- as long as you buy it and
   play it, I'm happy."

Gamasutra's favorite slides from GDC 2019

   By Staff | April 2, 2019
   [47364566342_636ada3422_k.jpg]

   [This article, originally published by game industry trade website (and
   GDC sibling organization) Gamasutra, showcases some key learnings from
   GDC 2019 last month -- in slide form!]

   GDC 2019 is now behind us, but like many developers who've fled San
   Francisco (or at least the Moscone Center), we're still processing some
   of the lessons we picked up from the many, many great talks at this
   year's show.

   Inspired by blogger Chris Zukowski, we at Gamasutra have reached into
   our own camera phones and grabbed the slides that left a specific
   impression on us.

   Whether you were at GDC this year and missed these talks, or couldn't
   attend for various reasons, we hope our takeaways help you with your
   own game development process!

Kris Graft (@krisgraft)

   To kick things off here's two slides from editor-in-chief Kris Graft's
   phone (that managed to survive being in constant proximity to greasy
   Carl's Jr. food):

   Graft: In his classic game postmortem on Sega’s Panzer Dragoon, Panzer
   Dragoon Zwei, and Panzer Dragoon Saga, director and series creator
   Yukio Futatsugi (now at game studio Grounding) was candid about the
   internal pressure at Sega to make Saturn games that could compete
   visually with the original PlayStation.

   Sega’s Saturn had superior 2D capabilities compared to PlayStation, but
   PlayStation had Saturn beat in terms of 3D graphics. For 3D games like
   Panzer Dragoon, Saturn developers had to implement rendering tricks
   that took advantage of the Saturn’s 2D strengths.

   The pressure brought upon by intense focus on PlayStation as a
   competitor still hasn’t left Futatsugi. “Even to this day, I have a
   lingering trauma about this any time someone mentions the original
   PlayStation. Those PlayStation Classic commercials made me real mad,”
   he said. So…don’t mention the original PlayStation around Futatsugi.

   Graft: In the session "Interactive Story Without Challenge Mechanics:
   The Design of Firewatch" Campo Santo’s Chris Remo outlined practical
   methods to make a narrative-focused game believable, reactive to player
   actions, and flexible in terms of game design tools.

   Remo (incidentally, a Gamasutra alum) cited a popular game dev quote
   that’s often attributed to Civilization creator Sid Meier: “A game is a
   series of interesting decisions." Remo put his own spin on that when it
   comes to games like Firewatch: “A good interactive narrative is a
   series of interesting outcomes.

   This stance is reflected in the way that Firewatch’s narrative is
   incredibly reactive to player choices – not just through textual
   choices, but also to player actions. So many of these transparent
   decisions that players make were taken into account by Firewatch’s
   writers and designers, who made sure even the smallest decisions had
   outcomes that would surprise and delight players.

Alex Wawro (@awawro)

   Contributing editor Alex Wawro had a lot of favorite slides, including
   an image of a children's slide emerging from the rear of an elephant
   sculpture. We won't be printing that one!

   Wawro: This slide, from Video Game History Foundation founder Frank
   Cifaldi's talk on "It's Still Emulation: Saving Video Game History
   Before It's Too Late", reminds us how important it is to have people
   who are working to preserve video game history. While a well-designed
   game can teach a player how to play, it takes an expert to teach you
   why the game was played, and what that experience was like.

   Wawro: This slide, from the GDC 2019 talk on "Why Fashion in (Most)
   Games Sucks, and Why You Should Care" by Kitfox Games' Victoria Tran,
   illustrates the three axes along which the fashion in your games
   communicates meaning to players.

   Wawro: Veteran indie dev Jason Rohrer threw up this slide during his
   talk on "2014 vs. 2018: The Shape of Financial Success Before and After
   the Indiepocalypse" to reinforce one bit of advice: if you're worried
   about making a great game that nobody will buy, look at your own play
   history and try to create the sort of game you actually play for long
   periods, rather than the kinds of games you keep telling yourself you'd
   like to play.

   Wawro: In his GDC 2019 talk on "Making Games That Stand Out and
   Survive" Slime Rancher director Nick Popovich encouraged devs to think
   of their games in terms of animated .gifs. If someone can 'get' your
   game in a single .gif, argues Popovich, then you've eliminated a lot of
   the friction that might keep them from buying a copy.

   Wawro: In these other two slides (second slide below) from Popovich's
   talk, devs are encouraged to create a place or mode that feels like
   "home" in order to give players a comfortable, low-stress place to hang
   out or return to without much friction. This encourages them to keep
   playing your game, even after long periods away, which in turn raises
   the odds that they'll buy some DLC, or inspire a friend to buy a copy
   as well.

Alissa McAloon (@Gliitchy)

   Alissa only had one favorite slide, but in a very on-brand fashion for
   her, it was about Hitman.

   McAloon: It’s a slide that probably doesn’t make much sense without a
   good helping of context, but still my favorite of the show. During
   Mette Podenphant Andersen’s talk on applying social anthropology
   principles to level design, she shared this color-coded map. It’s a map
   of what many consider Hitman 2016’s very best level, Sapienza, but
   overlaid with color to define the six different kinds of public and
   private spaces that are found throughout Hitman’s levels. You’ll have
   to check out my story on the talk or my Twitter thread on what I
   couldn’t fit into my story on the talk for a full rundown, but in short
   those different kinds of spaces each communicate a lot of information
   to players about their purpose and potential limitations just through
   knowledge most have from everyday life.

   This wasn’t a consideration when IO Interactive was making these
   levels, however, at least not consciously. Andersen was only an intern
   at the time and applied these terms and colors to the map as a way for
   her to better understand the team’s level design practices and apply
   terminology to something that was, at the time, new to her. As an end
   result, Hitman’s level design is more readable to a newcomer and
   experienced designers have a better understanding of how spaces
   function and interact. This slide is a neat example of what fresh eyes
   bring to a project and, given that these terms carried on into the
   development of Hitman 2, an example of how new perspective and
   sometimes even concepts from outside of game dev can lead to more
   informed design decisions.

Bryant Francis (@RBryant2012)

   For my own favorite slides, (seen on Gamasutra's GDC livetweeting), I
   pulled a few from talks that went outside my personal purview about
   narrative game design. GDC is a great opportunity for devs of different
   backgrounds to get a crash course in how their colleagues make games,
   and I thought it was important to expand my writer-oriented brain into
   the worlds of business, AI, and animation.

   Francis: First, there's this slide from Sophie Brennan's talk on the
   animation of Otto Octavius from Marvel's Spider-Man. Octavius comes off
   as an effortless creation when you're playing Insomniac's superhero
   game, but watching Brennan break down how atypical his rig was proved
   to be an incredible experience at GDC."

   "Brennan's slide here contrasts to a prior slide that showed the
   results of creating an individual rig for each of Octavius' tentacles.
   She followed up by breaking down a lot of the pseudocode and mathematic
   principles that helped make drive the character's unusual limbs.

   This particular slide struck me as a good shorthand for how Brennan and
   her colleagues at Insomniac conceptualized the animation process for
   Octavius. It's one thing to just say 'oh it's a Spider-Man game, we'll
   have Doc Ock and his limbs will do Doc Ock things,' but without a real
   prop to move around like in the Sam Raimi film Spider-Man 2, it's
   difficult to imagine how you could tell a computer to seamlessly
   manipulate such odd limbs. At GDC, Brennan did a stellar job explaining
   that conceptualization process to the crowd.

   Francis: This slide comes from Jonas Boetel's talk on the development
   of Subnautica , which charted the game's course from a 6-month,
   maybe-mobile gunless exploration game, and into a case study of the
   modern Early Access adventure title.

   Boetel's talk was illuminating on a number of topics (the
   instant-feedback system he discussed showed off some amazing
   telemetry), but the slide above feels in conversation with the slide
   from Jason Rohrer's talk about how mid-sized developers should be
   approaching game development in 2019. The above diagram highlights how
   Unknown Worlds is able to leverage open development, into marketing,
   into feedback, and back into more development, and he noted how similar
   it is to how live development on games-as-service titles works.

   Rohrer and Boetel appear to have correctly identified that players are
   now accustomed to open game development being a part of the
   entertainment value of a released game. Boetel explained that the team
   took inspiration from Team Fortress 2, which turned its game updates
   into must-see events. Unlike Valve, Unknown Worlds (and many other
   devs) now invite players to follow the path to these updates through
   open documentation and more direct community interaction.

   It would appear that it's more prudent then ever for developers to look
   to these update-driven titles as a model for their games, even if it's
   still a single-player, premium purchase experience. Luckily, a lot of
   developers at GDC have knowledge they can draw on in that endeavor.

   Francis: The last talk I attended at GDC this year was a session on the
   AI behind Kratos' son Atreus in 2018's God of War. Hayato Yoshidome did
   a great job deconstructing the design decisions behind Atreus, breaking
   down the successful and unsuccessful decisions that brought the child
   warrior to life.

   In this slide, Yoshidome explained the four attributes Atreus' battle
   interactions needed to have, which may seem obvious on the surface. But
   they really weren't! Yoshidome's talk explored how Atreus could
   sometimes ruin or exacerbate combat scenarios, and decisions that
   sometimes seemed helpful (like Atreus kiting enemies away from the
   player) often weren't.

   The guidelines in Yoshidome's slide up above feel like a good lens to
   view the final version of Atreus that players know and love. He's an AI
   presence whose job is to reliably facilitate player combos and
   clearly communicate everything he's doing even if it means breaking the
   laws of physics a little.
