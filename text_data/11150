CSRankings: Computer Science Rankings

   CSRankings is a metrics-based ranking of top computer science
   institutions around the world. Click on a triangle (►) to expand areas
   or institutions. Click on a name to go to a faculty member's home page.
   Click on a pie (the Piechart after a name or institution) to see their
   publication profile as a pie chart. Click on a Google Scholar icon (
   Google Scholar ) to see publications, and click on the DBLP logo ( DBLP
   ) to go to a DBLP entry.

Loading and processing data

   This ranking is designed to identify institutions and faculty actively
   engaged in research across a number of areas of computer science, based
   on the number of publications by faculty that have appeared at the most
   selective conferences in each area of computer science (see the FAQ for
   more details).
