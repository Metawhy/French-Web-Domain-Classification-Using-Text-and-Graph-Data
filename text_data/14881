   Home \

   Group is found COMPLIANT with the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical
   Business Practice.

   To view the assessment decision please click HERE.

WHAT IS THE MEDTECH EUROPE CODE?

   Important updates about the Code of Ethics

   A code for more transparency, effective 1st January 2018
   The MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice regulates all
   aspects of the industry’s relationships with Healthcare Professionals
   (HCPs) and Healthcare Organisations (HCOs).

   One important change introduced by the Code as of 1 January 2018 is
   discontinuation of direct sponsorship of HCPs. As of that date,
   independent medical education has to be supported exclusively by means
   of Educational Grants. Such Educational Grants can be provided to HCOs
   and PCOs.

   Kenes Group is officially recognised by MedTech Europe as a compliant,
   trusted PCO to rely on in the process of organising medical educational
   events.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE SUPPORT OF SIOP 2019?

   Educational Participation Grants
   As a trusted partner, Kenes Group will take on the responsibility for
   indirect sponsorship for SIOP 2019. The industry will entrust the Kenes
   Group and provide educational grants directly, and Kenes Group/SIOP
   will be responsible for participants (HCPs) pre-selection.

   Educational Participation Grants of any amount are appreciated and
   important to the success of SIOP 2019.

   Recipients (HCPs) will need to fulfil the criteria specified by SIOP in
   order to be eligible to apply for an educational participation grant.
   Accepted grant recipients will be contacted by the SIOP Congress
   Secretariat.

   Confirmed support for medical education
   Through this Code, members of MedTech Europe promote legitimate and
   ethical business practices, encouraging responsible and ethical
   interactions with HCPs and HCOs in the benefit of the patient.

   Don’t wait any longer to fulfill your educational needs and/or start
   supporting medical education at SIOP 2019!

FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS
