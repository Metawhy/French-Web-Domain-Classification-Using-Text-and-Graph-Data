Stampin’ Up! Magnolia Memory Toile Tidings for the Happy Inkin’ Thursday
Blog Hop

   Posted on October 3, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop.  Please be sure to visit
   everyone’s blog to see the great projects they are sharing with you.
   My card features the  Perfectly Plaid Stamp Set, the Magnolia Memory
   Dies and the Toile Tidings Designer Series Paper.  We are all working
   with a color challenge this week – here’s my card:

   And here are the colors we are using:

   These are such traditional colors for a Christmas card, so I decided to
   go for it.  I’ve seen this paper from the Toile Tidings DSP with red
   color added and decided to play with it.  I used a Real Red Stampin’
   Write marker to color the berries and poinsettias.

   Use the Magnolia Memory Dies to build a flower for the focal point – so
   easy and pretty, too!  The flower has four layers of Real Red card
   stock petals – two smaller and two larger.  Cut the larger stamen piece
   from Very Vanilla card stock and the smaller piece from Gold Foil
   paper.  All layers are adhered together with Multipurpose Liquid Glue.
   The Gold Foil leaf die cuts are glued to a panel of Garden Green card
   stock, then cut out by hand with Paper Snips.

   Glue the hand colored DSP to a panel of Real Red card stock.  Then add
   a the Gold 3/8″ Metallic Ribbon trim, wrapping ends to the back and
   securing with tape.  The completed layer is adhered to the front of the
   Very Vanilla Thick card base with Liquid Glue.

   Adhere the flower with Liquid Glue, then tuck the leaves under the
   bloom adhering with Mini Glue Dots.  Stamp the sentiment from the
   Perfectly Plaid stamp set with Real Red ink on a panel of Very Vanilla
   card stock.  Use the Timeless Label Punch to cut it out, then adhere
   the sentiment over the ribbon with Mini Stampin’ Dimensionals.  Add a
   Gold Faceted Gem to the flower center to complete.

   Stamp the sentiment from the Perfectly Plaid stamp set on a panel of
   Very Vanilla card stock with Real Red ink.  Adhere a strip of  Toile
   Tidings DSP along the bottom edge of the stamped panel before adhering
   to a panel of Real Red card stock, then adhere the layer to the inside
   of the card base, using Liquid Glue for all.

   *** You can find a complete list of supplies for this project,
   including card stock cuts, at the very bottom of this post.

Stampin’ Up! Memorable Mosaic Kindness for Simply Stampin’ Sunday

   Posted on September 29, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to Simply Stampin’ Sunday – my post of Clean And Simple
   projects that can be made in minutes using Stampin’ Up! products.  This
   week’s project features the Memorable Mosaic Stamp Set and the
   coordinating Mosaic Mood Specialty Designer Series Paper from the
   Mosaic Mood Suite.

   I love fussy-cutting and can sit down with a full sheet of Designer
   Series Paper and cut away until it’s all individual images, which I
   have done with Mosaic Mood Specialty DSP.  Wondering what makes it
   Special?  It has shiny accents that makes it look like mosaic tile!
   Since I have a collection of pre-cut images, this card went together
   pretty quickly.

   The word “Kindness” is stamped with Soft Suede ink on a panel of
   Blushing Bride card stock.  After it dries thoroughly, carefully color
   the letters with the brush tip of a Light Calypso Coral Blends marker.
   Use a light touch, it absorbs quickly.

   Though it’s hard to capture in pictures, the shiny “tile” accents are
   really special.

   Here are the Simple Steps to make this project:
    1. Cut a 4-1/4″ x 11″ panel of Soft Suede card stock, score at 5-1/2″
       and fold in half for the card base.
    2. Cut two 3-7/8″ x 5-1/8″ panels of Very Vanilla card stock.  One is
       for the front, and one is for the inside.
    3. Stamp the sentiment on the front panel centered side to side and
       top to bottom using Soft Suede ink.  I used the Stamparatus to do
       so.
    4. Stamp the sentiment on the inside panel in the same manner.
    5. Stamp the front sentiment again on a panel of Blushing Bride card
       stock with Soft Suede ink and set aside to dry thoroughly.
    6. Use your paper cutter to cut a couple Mint Macaron patterned tile
       strips from the strip pattern sheet of DSP.
    7. Cut the strips to 3-7/8″ long and adhere to the top and bottom
       edges of both panels of Very Vanilla card stock from Step 3 and
       Step 4 with Multipurpose Liquid Glue.
    8. Adhere each of the Very Vanilla panels to a 4″ x 5-1/4″ panel of
       Mint Macaron card stock using Liquid Glue.
    9. Adhere the layered panels to the card front and card inside using
       Liquid Glue.
   10. Use a Light Calypso Coral Blends marker to color the letters in the
       word “Kindness” you stamped in Step 5.  Use a light touch, it
       absorbs quickly.
   11. Fussy-cut “Kindness” along the outside edge of the tile border
       using your Paper Snips.
   12. Adhere the fussy-cut word over the stamped word using Liquid Glue.
   13. Use Stampin’ Dimensionals to adhere the fussy-cut hummingbird and
       fussy-cut rose to the card front.
   14. The little fussy-cut bee is adhered with a rolled Mini Glue Dot.
   15. The fussy-cut butterflies are adhered inside the card with Liquid
       Glue.

Stampin’ Up! Seasonal Wreaths for the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop

   Posted on September 26, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop.  Please be sure to visit
   everyone’s blog to see the great projects they are sharing with you.
   My card features the Seasonal Wreath Stamp Set, the All-Around Wreath
   Dies and the Pressed Petals Specialty Designer Series Paper.  We are
   all working with a sketch challenge this week – here’s my card:

   And here’s the sketch we’re using:

   To begin, stamp the fall wreath image from the Seasonal Wreaths stamp
   set with Early Espresso ink on a panel of Very Vanilla card stock.  Use
   the All Around Wreath Dies to cut it out, and set it aside to dry
   thoroughly.  I used the Stamparatus to be sure to get a crisp stamped
   image.  Use the Stamparatus Deluxe Foam Mat with photopolymer stamps
   for best results.

   Use a circle die from the Layering Circles Die Set to cut an opening in
   a panel of Pressed Petals Specialty Designer Series Paper to reveal the
   Very Vanilla layer that will align with the wreath opening.  Then glue
   the DSP layer to the Very Vanilla mat using Multipurpose Liquid Glue.
   Use the Stamparatus to stamp the sentiment from the Country Home stamp
   set with Cajun Craze ink centered in the opening.

   Wrap Cajun Craze Linen Thread from the Come To Gather Ribbon Combo Pack
   around the right side of the completed layer, securing the ends on the
   back with tape.  I chose to wrap it seven times, you may choose more or
   less.  Then adhere the completed layer to the front of the Early
   Espresso card base with Stampin’ Dimensionals.

   Color the wreath using Stampin’ Blends using fall colors.  The product
   listing at the end of this post has all the colors I used.  Then adhere
   the wreath to the card front using Mini Stampin’ Dimensionals.  Add a
   bow made from Cajun Craze Linen Thread to complete.

   Use Cajun Craze ink to stamp the sentiment from the Country Home stamp
   set on a panel of Very Vanilla card stock before adhering it inside the
   card base with Liquid Glue.

   including card stock cuts, at the very bottom of this post.

Stampin’ Up! Gather Together for the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop

   Posted on September 5, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop.  Please be sure to visit
   everyone’s blog to see the great projects they are sharing with you.
   My card features the Gather Together Stamp Set, Gathered Leaves
   Dies and Come to Gather Designer Series Paper.  We are all working with
   a color challenge this week – here’s my card:

   And here are the colors we are using in our projects:

   These colors reminded me of the deep rich tones of Fall.  And even
   though Fall is not “in the air” here in Georgia as yet, we know it’s
   coming – eventually.

   To begin, use Multipurpose Liquid Glue to adhere a strip of Come to
   Gather Designer Series Paper to a panel of Come to Gather Designer
   Series Paper 1/4″ in from the right edge.  Then adhere to a panel of
   Cajun Craze card stock.  The completed layer is then adhered to the
   front of an Early Espresso card base using Liquid Glue

   Stamp the leaf image from the Gather Together stamp set with Crumb Cake
   ink on a panel of Crumb Cake card stock – stamped off once first.  Then
   stamp the sentiment from the Gather Together stamp set using Early
   Espresso ink over the the leaf image.  Cut out with a die from the
   Stitched Nested Labels Dies.  Use Liquid Glue to adhere to a mat cut
   from Pretty Peacock card stock with a die the next size up.  Trim off
   the right end of the label to “square it up” as shown.  Wrap a length
   of Cajun Craze Linen Thread from the Come to Gather Ribbon Combo Pack
   around the end of the label three times and secure ends to the back
   side with tape.  Adhere the label to the card front with Mini Stampin’
   Dimensionals.

   Add some Pretty Peacock and Crumb Cake branches cut with dies from the
   Frosted Bouquet Dies to the label and the lower left front corner of
   the card using dabs of Liquid Glue.  The leaf is cut from Cajun Craze
   card stock (spritzed lightly with water first) with a die from the
   Gathered Leaves Dies.  Adhere with Glue Dots.  Finish with a double bow
   using Cajun Craze Linen Thread and natural Linen Thread.  Add some gold
   Metallic Pearls and it’s done!

   Add the leaf image stamped with Crumb Cake ink, stamped off once first,
   to the center of a panel of Crumb Cake card stock.  The sentiment is
   stamped with Early Espresso ink and then the panel is adhered to a
   Cajun Craze card stock mat before adhering to the inside of the card
   base with Liquid Glue.

   including card stock cuts, at the very bottom of this post.

Stampin’ Up! Red Magnolia Christmas for the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop

   Posted on August 29, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop.  Please be sure to visit
   everyone’s blog to see the great projects they are sharing with you.
   My card features the Rustic Retreat Stamp Set and Magnolia
   Lane Designer Series Paper.  We are all working with a sketch challenge
   this week – here’s my card:

   And here is the sketch we are all using for inspiration:

   I tried coloring the blooms in the Magnolia Lane Designer Series Paper,
   as I have seen a few projects with colored blooms and liked them.  Use
   the brush tip of a Dark Real Red Stampin’ Blends marker to add color to
   the flower petals – so easy and such striking results!  Cut the panel
   to size and adhere to a Gold Foil mat with Multipurpose Liquid Glue.
   The DSP is centered on the foil panel top to bottom, even with the left
   edge with the mat showing along the right side.  Then use Liquid Glue
   to adhere the completed layer to the card front centered top to bottom,
   even with the left edge.

   Use StazOn Jet Black ink to stamp the sentiment from the Rustic Retreat
   stamp set on a panel of Very Vanilla card stock.  Cut the sentiment
   layer with a die from the Layering Circles Dies set.  Adhere the
   sentiment to a circle mat of Basic Black, then adhere the layer to a
   Gold Foil scalloped circle mat cut with the same dies.

   Flag the ends of a length of 3/8″ Gold Metallic Edge Ribbon.  Adhere to
   the card front arranged as shown with Mini Glue Dots.  The sentiment
   piece is adhered in place over the ribbon embellishment using Stampin’
   Dimensionals.

   Use a die from the Magnolia Memory Dies to cut a single bloom from a
   panel of Magnolia Lane DSP.  Color the flower petals with a Dark Real
   Red Stampin’ Blends marker, then adhere it to a panel of Very Vanilla
   card stock before adhering the panel to the inside of the card with
   Liquid Glue.

   including card stock cuts, at the very bottom of this post.

Stampin’ Up! Sailing Home True North for the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop

   Posted on August 22, 2019 by suepr8ther

   Welcome to the Happy Inkin’ Thursday Blog Hop.  Please be sure to visit
   everyone’s blog to see the great projects they are sharing with you.
   My card features many products in the Come Sail Away Suite which
   include the Sailing Home Stamp Set and coordinating Smooth Sailing
   Dies, Come Sail Away Memories & More Card Pack and the Come Sail Away
   Designer Series Paper.  We are all working with a color challenge this
   week – here’s my card:

   And here are the colors we are using:

   My design was inspired by the challenge at CAS(E) this Sketch #335

   I’m also playing along in the As You See It Challenge #207

   To begin, trim a 4″ x 6″ card from the Come Sail Away Memories & More
   card pack down to 4″ x 5-1/2″.  Use Night of Navy ink and the
   Stamparatus to stamp the sentiment from the Sailing Home stamp set in
   the bottom right corner of the card.  Then adhere the card to the front
   of a Night of Navy card base with Multipurpose Liquid Glue.  Use Paper
   Snips to fussy-cut the rope image from a panel of Come Sail Away
   Designer Series Paper.  Adhere to the card front with Liquid Glue.

   Use the largest die from the Layering Circles Dies to cut the compass
   image from a panel of Come Sail Away DSP.  Flip the die over and use a
   pencil to trace around the outside edge of the die on a panel of wood
   grain paper from the Pressed Petals Specialty DSP.  Use Paper Snips to
   cut out the circle mat.  Use Liquid Glue to adhere the compass image to
   the wood grain mat.

   Use the Smooth Sailing Dies to cut the compass needle.  The wider
   bottom piece is cut from a scrap of Soft Suede card stock.  The smaller
   detailed piece is cut from a scrap of Night of Navy card stock.  Adhere
   the pieces together with a few dabs of Liquid Glue.  Use the Piercing
   Tip in the Take Your Pick tool to make a hole through the center of the
   compass needle and the compass layer.  Insert a small silver brad
   through the compass needle, a metal ships wheel from the Sail Away
   Trinkets and the compass piece to secure the layers.  Adhere the
   completed piece to the card front with Stampin’ Dimensionals.

   Tie a knot in a length of twine from the Nature’s Twine collection and
   use a Glue Dot to adhere to the card front alongside a metal anchor
   from the Sail Away Trinkets.  The inside panel of Whisper White card
   stock has the same fussy-cut rope design accent to coordinate with the
   front of the card.

   including card stock cuts, at the very bottom of this post.
