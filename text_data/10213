Oswald Mosley

   English politician
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   See Article History
   Alternative Titles: Sir Oswald Mosley, 6th Baronet

   Oswald Mosley, in full Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet, (born
   November 16, 1896, London, England—died December 3, 1980, Orsay, near
   Paris, France), English politician who was the leader of the British
   Union of Fascists from 1932 to 1940 and of its successor, the Union
   Movement, from 1948 until his death. Those groups were known for
   distributing anti-Semitic propaganda, conducting hostile demonstrations
   in the Jewish sections of East London, and wearing Nazi-style uniforms
   and insignia.

   Mosley served in the House of Commons from 1918 to 1931, successively
   as a Conservative, an Independent, and a Labour Party member, serving
   in a Labour ministry in 1929–30. In 1931 he tried to form a socialist
   party but was defeated for reelection to Parliament. The next year he
   founded the British Union of Fascists, for which some enthusiasm was
   generated by his own powerful oratory and by the support of the
   newspaper publisher Viscount Rothermere. Interned after the outbreak of
   World War II, Mosley was released in 1943 because of illness. On
   February 7, 1948, he launched the Union Movement, which he described as
   an amalgam of 51 organizations, most of them right-wing book clubs.

   Mosley married in 1920 Lady Cynthia Blanche Curzon (died 1933),
   daughter of the 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston; and in 1936 Diana
   Guinness (née Freeman-Mitford), a prewar apologist of Nazi Germany and
   a daughter of the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Mosley’s autobiography, My Life,
   was published in 1968.

Franz Josef Land

   archipelago, Russia
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   Last Updated: Aug 13, 2019 See Article History
   Alternative Titles: Frantsa-Iosifa Land, Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa

   Franz Josef Land, Russian Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa, archipelago of 191
   islands in the northeastern Barents Sea, the northernmost territory of
   Russia. It falls administratively into Arkhangelsk oblast (province).
   The islands, with a land area of 6,229 square miles (16,134 square km),
   consist of three groups. The easternmost includes Rudolf Island, whose
   Fligeli Cape is the northernmost point in Russia, and the large islands
   of Zemlya Vilcheka and Greem-Bell (Graham Bell). This group is
   separated from the central group, which contains most of the islands,
   by the Avstriysky (Austrian) Strait. The western group, divided from
   the rest of the archipelago by the Britansky Channel (British Channel),
   contains two large islands, Zemlya Georga (the largest, with an area of
   about 1,120 square miles [2,900 square km]) and Zemlya Aleksandry.

   Island, Franz Josef Land, Russia.Wofratz

   Franz Josef Land is mainly low-lying; the highest point, on
   Viner-Nyoyshtadt Island, reaches 2,034 feet (620 metres). It comprises
   a series of lowland plateaus, 85 percent of whose surface is covered by
   ice. The islands are formed from marine deposits of Early and Middle
   Jurassic age (about 160 to 200 million years old) and are covered by
   thick basaltic crusts. Elsewhere are Late Cretaceous deposits (about 65
   to 100 million years old) with occasional lignite also overlain by
   basalt. During the Early Jurassic, Franz Josef Land was a single
   landmass; it was dislocated during the Quaternary Period (the past 2.6
   million years) by severe faulting. As a result, the straits between the
   islands are often very deep, up to 1,650 feet (500 metres) deeper than
   the surrounding Barents Sea.

   The climate is severe, the average winter temperature being -8° F (-22°
   C), the average summer temperature 35° F (2° C), though summer
   temperatures of up to 54° F (12° C) have been recorded. Vegetation
   consists primarily of lichens, mosses, and about three dozen species of
   Arctic flowering plants. Fauna include polar bears and the Arctic fox,
   with numerous bird species, of which perhaps 15 nest in the islands.
   Marine fauna include the walrus, seal, and bearded seal.

   Franz Josef Land was discovered by an Austro-Hungarian expedition under
   Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht in 1873; it was named after the
   Austrian emperor. The Soviet Union annexed the islands in 1926 and
   maintained permanent weather stations there.

King William Island

   island, Nunavut, Canada
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   See Article History

   King William Island, island, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
   western Nunavut territory, between Victoria Island and Boothia
   Peninsula. The island is separated from the mainland (Adelaide
   Peninsula) by the Storis Passage and Simpson Strait. It is about 110
   miles (175 km) long and 100 miles (160 km) wide and has an area of
   5,062 square miles (13,111 square km). The terrain is comparatively
   flat, with an average elevation of 300 feet (91 metres), rising to 450
   feet (137 metres) at Mount Matheson. The coastline is irregular. Gjoa
   Haven (Uqsuqtuq) on the southeast coast, where the Norwegian explorer
   Roald Amundsen wintered in 1903–05, is the only trading post.
   Discovered in 1830 by Commander James Ross, it was named for the
   then-reigning British monarch, William IV. There is an airstrip at Gjoa
   Haven.

North Atlantic Oscillation

   climatology
   Written By:
     * John P. Rafferty

   See Article History
   Alternative Title: NAO

   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an irregular fluctuation of
   atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean that has a strong
   effect on winter weather in Europe, Greenland, northeastern North
   America, North Africa, and northern Asia. The NAO can occur on a yearly
   basis, or the fluctuations can take place decades apart. It is an
   “oscillation” because the changes in atmospheric pressure are
   essentially a back-and-forth switching between two prevailing patterns,
   or modes: a “positive mode,” in which a strong subtropical high is
   located over the Azores islands in the central North Atlantic while a
   strong low-pressure system is centred over Iceland, and a “negative
   mode,” in which weaker high- and low-pressure systems are found over
   the same locations. The first observations of this pattern were made by
   the Danish priest and missionary Hans Egede Saabye in the 1770s, but it
   was the British climatologist Sir Gilbert Walker who first coined the
   term North Atlantic Oscillation in the 1920s.
   The typical path of the polar-front jet stream during negative and
   positive modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation.
   The typical path of the polar-front jet stream during negative and
   positive modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation.Encyclopædia
   Britannica, Inc.

   The phase of the oscillation (that is, whether the oscillation is in
   the positive or the negative mode) and the relative strength of the
   pressure gradient (that is, the difference in pressure between the high
   and low systems) are gauged by the NAO index, which was derived from
   air-pressure readings taken at sea level at stations in Iceland and the
   Azores (though readings collected at Lisbon have been used to represent
   the Azores at times). The most accurate index values result from
   calculating the pressure difference between the centre of the Icelandic
   low and the centre of the Azores high. Since the centres of these
   pressure cells actually may be located some distance away from the
   recording stations, a technique known as “principal components
   time-series analysis” is sometimes used to infer the pressure
   differences between the cells regardless of the location of the centre
   of the cell. Daily index values are often graphed in order to track
   day-to-day changes, but data also can be aggregated into monthly and
   yearly values in order to illuminate long-term patterns.

Positive NAO

   During winters when the NAO is in its positive mode, the presence of
   the strong high-pressure and strong low-pressure systems produces
   warmer, wetter conditions over northern Europe and most of northeastern
   North America. This occurs because the polar-front jet stream tends to
   be free of large undulations (Rossby waves), and the jet stream’s
   westerly winds funnel storms over the Mid-Atlantic states, between the
   strong North Atlantic pressure cells, and over northern Europe. Also
   under the positive NAO mode, colder conditions prevail over parts of
   Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and western Greenland, and
   additional sea ice develops in Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, and off western
   Greenland. The Mediterranean region, meanwhile, experiences cool, dry
   winter weather.

   During the spring following a winter dominated by the positive NAO,
   warm sea-surface temperatures occur along the eastern seaboard of the
   United States and Canada’s Maritime Provinces. Such warm-water
   conditions are possibly brought on by the close approach of the Gulf
   Stream to the coast, which may reduce the influence of the cold
   westward-moving longshore current that flows along the southern coasts
   of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.

Negative NAO

   During winters governed by the negative mode of the NAO, colder
   conditions are brought to eastern North America and northern Europe
   mainly by more-frequent intrusions of Arctic air. North America
   receives additional snow, while Europe receives less precipitation than
   normal. The drier conditions over northern Europe result from the weak
   state of the pressure cells over Iceland and the North Atlantic during
   the NAO’s negative mode; the reduced pressure gradient over the region
   slows the pace of westerly winds, which allows cold, dry air to be
   drawn into northern Europe from northern Russia and the Arctic. During
   such years a prominent northward-reaching arc in the polar-front jet
   stream, caused in part by blocking anticyclones that redirect the jet
   stream northward, allows warmer conditions to prevail from Hudson Bay
   to western Greenland. The jet stream, after skirting the reduced
   low-pressure cell over Iceland, arcs south over the North Atlantic to
   funnel moisture and warm air to southern Europe.

   During springs governed by negative NAO conditions, ocean-surface
   temperatures are colder off the eastern seaboard of the United States
   and Canada. In these years the warmer Gulf Stream follows a more
   southerly track, so the influence of the colder longshore current is
   stronger.

The NAO and shifting climate

   Many scientists argue that the “locking” of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation into one mode or another over periods of several years has
   been associated with extended shifts in the climates of Europe and
   eastern North America. Geologically recent climatic intervals, such as
   the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, are thought to have
   been strongly influenced by the behaviour of the NAO. The Medieval Warm
   Period is a highly controversial topic in climatology, but scientists
   who postulate its existence argue that an interval of warmer
   temperatures and reduced climatic variability took place over the North
   Atlantic region from 900 to 1300 ce, and some of these scientists
   attribute the warm conditions to periods of several years dominated by
   the positive mode of the NAO. In contrast, many scientists contend that
   the Little Ice Age, a period from roughly 1300 to 1850 when the climate
   was somewhat colder and more variable than today, was caused by the
   dominance of the negative mode of the NAO.

   The Time a Law Clerk Successfully Forged a New Shakespeare Play to
   Impress His Dad

   William-Henry Ireland's father thought he was dull, uninspired, and
   talentless. So William-Henry began a project that would lead to
   national excitement, a riot, and with any luck, the love and adoration
   of his father. He forged an “undiscovered” new play by William
   Shakespeare—and it actually premiered on a London stage.

Oswald Mosley

   English politician
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   See Article History
   Alternative Titles: Sir Oswald Mosley, 6th Baronet

   Oswald Mosley, in full Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet, (born
   November 16, 1896, London, England—died December 3, 1980, Orsay, near
   Paris, France), English politician who was the leader of the British
   Union of Fascists from 1932 to 1940 and of its successor, the Union
   Movement, from 1948 until his death. Those groups were known for
   distributing anti-Semitic propaganda, conducting hostile demonstrations
   in the Jewish sections of East London, and wearing Nazi-style uniforms
   and insignia.

   Mosley served in the House of Commons from 1918 to 1931, successively
   as a Conservative, an Independent, and a Labour Party member, serving
   in a Labour ministry in 1929–30. In 1931 he tried to form a socialist
   party but was defeated for reelection to Parliament. The next year he
   founded the British Union of Fascists, for which some enthusiasm was
   generated by his own powerful oratory and by the support of the
   newspaper publisher Viscount Rothermere. Interned after the outbreak of
   World War II, Mosley was released in 1943 because of illness. On
   February 7, 1948, he launched the Union Movement, which he described as
   an amalgam of 51 organizations, most of them right-wing book clubs.

   daughter of the 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston; and in 1936 Diana
   Guinness (née Freeman-Mitford), a prewar apologist of Nazi Germany and
   a daughter of the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Mosley’s autobiography, My Life,
   was published in 1968.

Franz Josef Land

   archipelago, Russia
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   Last Updated: Aug 13, 2019 See Article History
   Alternative Titles: Frantsa-Iosifa Land, Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa

   Franz Josef Land, Russian Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa, archipelago of 191
   islands in the northeastern Barents Sea, the northernmost territory of
   Russia. It falls administratively into Arkhangelsk oblast (province).
   The islands, with a land area of 6,229 square miles (16,134 square km),
   consist of three groups. The easternmost includes Rudolf Island, whose
   Fligeli Cape is the northernmost point in Russia, and the large islands
   of Zemlya Vilcheka and Greem-Bell (Graham Bell). This group is
   separated from the central group, which contains most of the islands,
   by the Avstriysky (Austrian) Strait. The western group, divided from
   the rest of the archipelago by the Britansky Channel (British Channel),
   contains two large islands, Zemlya Georga (the largest, with an area of
   about 1,120 square miles [2,900 square km]) and Zemlya Aleksandry.

   Island, Franz Josef Land, Russia.Wofratz

   Franz Josef Land is mainly low-lying; the highest point, on
   Viner-Nyoyshtadt Island, reaches 2,034 feet (620 metres). It comprises
   a series of lowland plateaus, 85 percent of whose surface is covered by
   ice. The islands are formed from marine deposits of Early and Middle
   Jurassic age (about 160 to 200 million years old) and are covered by
   thick basaltic crusts. Elsewhere are Late Cretaceous deposits (about 65
   to 100 million years old) with occasional lignite also overlain by
   basalt. During the Early Jurassic, Franz Josef Land was a single
   landmass; it was dislocated during the Quaternary Period (the past 2.6
   million years) by severe faulting. As a result, the straits between the
   islands are often very deep, up to 1,650 feet (500 metres) deeper than
   the surrounding Barents Sea.

   The climate is severe, the average winter temperature being -8° F (-22°
   C), the average summer temperature 35° F (2° C), though summer
   temperatures of up to 54° F (12° C) have been recorded. Vegetation
   consists primarily of lichens, mosses, and about three dozen species of
   Arctic flowering plants. Fauna include polar bears and the Arctic fox,
   with numerous bird species, of which perhaps 15 nest in the islands.
   Marine fauna include the walrus, seal, and bearded seal.

   Franz Josef Land was discovered by an Austro-Hungarian expedition under
   Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht in 1873; it was named after the
   Austrian emperor. The Soviet Union annexed the islands in 1926 and
   maintained permanent weather stations there.

King William Island

   island, Nunavut, Canada
   Written By:
     * The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

   See Article History

   King William Island, island, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
   western Nunavut territory, between Victoria Island and Boothia
   Peninsula. The island is separated from the mainland (Adelaide
   Peninsula) by the Storis Passage and Simpson Strait. It is about 110
   miles (175 km) long and 100 miles (160 km) wide and has an area of
   5,062 square miles (13,111 square km). The terrain is comparatively
   flat, with an average elevation of 300 feet (91 metres), rising to 450
   feet (137 metres) at Mount Matheson. The coastline is irregular. Gjoa
   Haven (Uqsuqtuq) on the southeast coast, where the Norwegian explorer
   Roald Amundsen wintered in 1903–05, is the only trading post.
   Discovered in 1830 by Commander James Ross, it was named for the
   then-reigning British monarch, William IV. There is an airstrip at Gjoa
   Haven.

North Atlantic Oscillation

   climatology
   Written By:
     * John P. Rafferty

   See Article History
   Alternative Title: NAO

   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an irregular fluctuation of
   atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean that has a strong
   effect on winter weather in Europe, Greenland, northeastern North
   America, North Africa, and northern Asia. The NAO can occur on a yearly
   basis, or the fluctuations can take place decades apart. It is an
   “oscillation” because the changes in atmospheric pressure are
   essentially a back-and-forth switching between two prevailing patterns,
   or modes: a “positive mode,” in which a strong subtropical high is
   located over the Azores islands in the central North Atlantic while a
   strong low-pressure system is centred over Iceland, and a “negative
   mode,” in which weaker high- and low-pressure systems are found over
   the same locations. The first observations of this pattern were made by
   the Danish priest and missionary Hans Egede Saabye in the 1770s, but it
   was the British climatologist Sir Gilbert Walker who first coined the
   term North Atlantic Oscillation in the 1920s.
   The typical path of the polar-front jet stream during negative and
   positive modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation.
   The typical path of the polar-front jet stream during negative and
   positive modes of the North Atlantic Oscillation.Encyclopædia
   Britannica, Inc.

   The phase of the oscillation (that is, whether the oscillation is in
   the positive or the negative mode) and the relative strength of the
   pressure gradient (that is, the difference in pressure between the high
   and low systems) are gauged by the NAO index, which was derived from
   air-pressure readings taken at sea level at stations in Iceland and the
   Azores (though readings collected at Lisbon have been used to represent
   the Azores at times). The most accurate index values result from
   calculating the pressure difference between the centre of the Icelandic
   low and the centre of the Azores high. Since the centres of these
   pressure cells actually may be located some distance away from the
   recording stations, a technique known as “principal components
   time-series analysis” is sometimes used to infer the pressure
   differences between the cells regardless of the location of the centre
   of the cell. Daily index values are often graphed in order to track
   day-to-day changes, but data also can be aggregated into monthly and
   yearly values in order to illuminate long-term patterns.

Positive NAO

   During winters when the NAO is in its positive mode, the presence of
   the strong high-pressure and strong low-pressure systems produces
   warmer, wetter conditions over northern Europe and most of northeastern
   North America. This occurs because the polar-front jet stream tends to
   be free of large undulations (Rossby waves), and the jet stream’s
   westerly winds funnel storms over the Mid-Atlantic states, between the
   strong North Atlantic pressure cells, and over northern Europe. Also
   under the positive NAO mode, colder conditions prevail over parts of
   Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and western Greenland, and
   additional sea ice develops in Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, and off western
   Greenland. The Mediterranean region, meanwhile, experiences cool, dry
   winter weather.

   During the spring following a winter dominated by the positive NAO,
   warm sea-surface temperatures occur along the eastern seaboard of the
   United States and Canada’s Maritime Provinces. Such warm-water
   conditions are possibly brought on by the close approach of the Gulf
   Stream to the coast, which may reduce the influence of the cold
   westward-moving longshore current that flows along the southern coasts
   of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.

Negative NAO

   During winters governed by the negative mode of the NAO, colder
   conditions are brought to eastern North America and northern Europe
   mainly by more-frequent intrusions of Arctic air. North America
   receives additional snow, while Europe receives less precipitation than
   normal. The drier conditions over northern Europe result from the weak
   state of the pressure cells over Iceland and the North Atlantic during
   the NAO’s negative mode; the reduced pressure gradient over the region
   slows the pace of westerly winds, which allows cold, dry air to be
   drawn into northern Europe from northern Russia and the Arctic. During
   such years a prominent northward-reaching arc in the polar-front jet
   stream, caused in part by blocking anticyclones that redirect the jet
   stream northward, allows warmer conditions to prevail from Hudson Bay
   to western Greenland. The jet stream, after skirting the reduced
   low-pressure cell over Iceland, arcs south over the North Atlantic to
   funnel moisture and warm air to southern Europe.

   During springs governed by negative NAO conditions, ocean-surface
   temperatures are colder off the eastern seaboard of the United States
   and Canada. In these years the warmer Gulf Stream follows a more
   southerly track, so the influence of the colder longshore current is
   stronger.

The NAO and shifting climate

   Many scientists argue that the “locking” of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation into one mode or another over periods of several years has
   been associated with extended shifts in the climates of Europe and
   eastern North America. Geologically recent climatic intervals, such as
   the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, are thought to have
   been strongly influenced by the behaviour of the NAO. The Medieval Warm
   Period is a highly controversial topic in climatology, but scientists
   who postulate its existence argue that an interval of warmer
   temperatures and reduced climatic variability took place over the North
   Atlantic region from 900 to 1300 ce, and some of these scientists
   attribute the warm conditions to periods of several years dominated by
   the positive mode of the NAO. In contrast, many scientists contend that
   the Little Ice Age, a period from roughly 1300 to 1850 when the climate
   was somewhat colder and more variable than today, was caused by the
   dominance of the negative mode of the NAO.

   The Time a Law Clerk Successfully Forged a New Shakespeare Play to
   Impress His Dad

   William-Henry Ireland's father thought he was dull, uninspired, and
   talentless. So William-Henry began a project that would lead to
   national excitement, a riot, and with any luck, the love and adoration
   of his father. He forged an “undiscovered” new play by William
   Shakespeare—and it actually premiered on a London stage.

   What Did Shakespeare Sound Like?

   We can't know for sure what Shakespeare sounded like. Although there
   are no recordings of Shakespeare—Edison would not invent his phonograph
   for another 260 or so years—scholars have a pretty good idea of how the
   bard might have sounded.
