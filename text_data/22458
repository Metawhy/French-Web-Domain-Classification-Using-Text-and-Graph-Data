About Hammerting

   Hammerting is a vertical dwarven mining colony sim with RPG elements
   for PC.

   Yes, it is all those things, and more!

Dwarves Being Dwarves

   [javascript]

Colorful Personalities

   Does Åglöf’s fancy ancestry clash with Vargskreva’s humble upbringing?
   Is your explorer afraid of the dark? Has your master crafter reached
   her Ballmer Peak? Exploit your dwarves’ strengths as well as their
   weaknesses to succeed.
   [javascript]

Skilled Craftspeople

   Anyone can craft an iron sword; but only dwarves can haggle a Crystal
   Cave Dragon to sell her fiery plasma breath, pump it up to a Andthril
   Forge of Doom and use it to craft an… Iron Sword +2.
   [javascript]

Elegant Home

   Technically, one could design doors and rooms roughly sized after the
   person using them, but that is not the dwarven way. A leeway margin of
   at least 5.25 meters is recommended in the Dwarven Architecture
   Handbook, but of course, that was written by a half-dwarf,
   half-environmentalist. Real dwarves need at least 11 meters.
   [javascript]

Verticality

   Dwarves are big on elevators, but not so much on free falling. It
   follows that they’d have their own takes on hellevators. For example,
   members of Clan Steelbrow prefer a traditional shaft dug straight down,
   straddled by a crane with a 300 meter rope, and nothing but a barrel to
   stand in. Needless to say, the barrel’s built-in bar is stocked with
   ale.

Living Cave

   Dwarven Beer Recipe: Farm wheat, preferably in a dry, but not barren
   biome. Grind it, put it in a lake, and boil for two weeks. Hunt down
   and add three Malty Slimes, stir. Boil for another week. Chill. Add two
   liters of yeast from a Sweaty Swamp Ogre (find them by following the
   stench of Musty Mangrove Moss), cover and ferment.
   [javascript]

Modding

   Don’t like the game? No worries, just buy it anyways and mod it to your
   heart’s content!

   Hammerting’s mod support is extensive, from adding models, textures,
   and animations to extending the gameplay with low level C++.
