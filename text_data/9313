   Backpacking Denali National Park: What You Need to Know

Backpacking Denali National Park: What You Need to Know

September 23, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Backpacking Denali National Park is a bucket list item for many outdoor
   enthusiasts. It’s also a great way to see the park beyond the
   established roads and trails. In fact, there aren’t any trails in much
   of Denali’s 6 million acres, so backpacking here is a true wilderness
   experience. Upon arrival in Denali National Park, we didn’t have any
   plans to spend a night in the great outdoors. However, after a few days
   of witnessing the vast landscape of rolling…

More than a Mountain: Denali National Park Travel Guide

September 9, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 0 Comment

   When you think of famous landscapes in Alaska, Denali National Park is
   often one of the first places that comes to mind. Known as Alaska’s
   Crown Jewel of the North, it was the first national park in the Last
   Frontier. Every year over 600,000 visitors flock to the 6 million acre
   wilderness to hike, climb, camp, backpack, or just catch a glimpse of
   North America’s highest peak which stands 20,310 feet tall. When we
   began planning our Ultimate Alaskan Road…

   Dawson City, Yukon: The Heart of the Klondike Gold Rush

Dawson City, Yukon: The Heart of the Klondike Gold Rush

August 26, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Dawson City, a small town in the northern reaches of Canada, celebrates
   its history perhaps more than any other place we’ve been. In fact, many
   aspects of the Klondike Gold Rush era are still alive and well
   today—dirt roads edged by wooden plank walkways, vaudeville shows,
   sultry saloons, a bath house in lieu of showers, and even rowdy gold
   miners. As irony goes, my favorite town so far on our “Alaska” road
   trip isn’t in Alaska (or even the US)…

Everything You Need to Know About the Alaska Marine Highway

August 19, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 2 comments

   When planning an ultimate Alaska road trip, a voyage on the Alaska
   Marine Highway, also known as the Alaska State Ferry, is a must! This
   impressive “highway” stretches 3,500 miles of coastline from
   Bellingham, Washington, up through Alaska’s Inside Passage to Skagway.
   Then heads west across the Gulf of Alaska and follows the southern
   coastline out to the Aleutian Islands. Our trek on the ferry system was
   an exciting and unique experience and a highlight of our Alaska road
   trip….

   Exploring Glacier Bay National Park by Land (and Sea Kayak)

Exploring Glacier Bay National Park by Land (and Sea Kayak)

July 29, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 2 comments

   Where are the glaciers? That was our first question when we arrived at
   Glacier Bay National Park. As it turns out we didn’t have the typical
   experience here. In fact, we’re part of the 10% of park visitors that
   set foot on land in Glacier Bay National Park. The other 90% see the
   park from the deck of an Alaska cruise ship and spend just 8-10 hours
   in the park. Glacier Bay National Park is the first official national
   park…

Our Favorite Things to Do in Sitka, Alaska

July 22, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 2 comments

   We are super excited to share this destination guide from our road trip
   to Alaska. Our first stop is Sitka, Alaska. We chose Sitka because two
   of my college roommates (who I was well overdue for a visit with) live
   there and it was a perfect beginning to our Alaskan adventure. This
   small island city did not disappoint. There are tons of things to do in
   Sitka. We were lucky enough to spend a week and explore the nature,
   culture,…

Sitka Tribal Tours: An Introduction to Alaskan Culture

July 8, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 2 comments

   The first few weeks of travel in Alaska and Canada have been a wild
   ride both figuratively and literally. We’ve taken Stan the Tan Van on 6
   boat voyages, kayaked with sea lions (not intentionally, mind you),
   camped across from a glacier, celebrated Canada Day with a sour-toe
   cocktail (complete with a mummified human toe) in an old mining town,
   and US Independence Day at the crossroads of Tok, Alaska. Needless to
   say, we have a lot to share already…

Guadalupe Mountains National Park: Hiking on an Ancient Sea Reef in the Sky

June 24, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Guadalupe Mountains National Park is one of those parks that doesn’t
   get a lot of limelight. In fact, a few years ago, before we started our
   quest to visit all the US national parks, I hadn’t even heard of
   Guadalupe Mountains. It’s neighbor in New Mexico—Carlsbad Caverns—gets
   a lot more attention and when you think of a national park in Texas,
   it’s usually Big Bend that comes to mind. It may be due to its modest
   nature, but Guadalupe Mountains…

24 Hours in Petrified Forest National Park

June 10, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Petrified Forest National Park is a place where you can travel through
   time and literally see layers of earth’s geological and human history.
   The petrified wood of the park’s namesake are actually fossils from the
   Triassic Period—225 million years ago. Traces of human habitation here
   can be dated back over 13,000 years. And within the last hundred years
   there’s a rich history of our modern society’s interest in the
   Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. Before I get into the details…

   A Day in the Border Town of Boquillas del Carmen We’ve already
   established that Big Bend National Park in Texas is one of the most
   diverse, beautiful, and all-around kick-ass awesome parks we’ve been to
   yet. As I mentioned in my last post, a highlight of our time in Big
   Bend was taking a day trip across the border to the town of Boquillas

More than a Mountain: Denali National Park Travel Guide

September 9, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 0 Comment

   When you think of famous landscapes in Alaska, Denali National Park is
   often one of the first places that comes to mind. Known as Alaska’s
   Crown Jewel of the North, it was the first national park in the Last
   Frontier. Every year over 600,000 visitors flock to the 6 million acre
   wilderness to hike, climb, camp, backpack, or just catch a glimpse of
   North America’s highest peak which stands 20,310 feet tall. When we
   began planning our Ultimate Alaskan Road…

   Dawson City, Yukon: The Heart of the Klondike Gold Rush

Dawson City, Yukon: The Heart of the Klondike Gold Rush

August 26, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Dawson City, a small town in the northern reaches of Canada, celebrates
   its history perhaps more than any other place we’ve been. In fact, many
   aspects of the Klondike Gold Rush era are still alive and well
   today—dirt roads edged by wooden plank walkways, vaudeville shows,
   sultry saloons, a bath house in lieu of showers, and even rowdy gold
   miners. As irony goes, my favorite town so far on our “Alaska” road
   trip isn’t in Alaska (or even the US)…

Everything You Need to Know About the Alaska Marine Highway

August 19, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 2 comments

   When planning an ultimate Alaska road trip, a voyage on the Alaska
   Marine Highway, also known as the Alaska State Ferry, is a must! This
   impressive “highway” stretches 3,500 miles of coastline from
   Bellingham, Washington, up through Alaska’s Inside Passage to Skagway.
   Then heads west across the Gulf of Alaska and follows the southern
   coastline out to the Aleutian Islands. Our trek on the ferry system was
   an exciting and unique experience and a highlight of our Alaska road
   trip….

   Exploring Glacier Bay National Park by Land (and Sea Kayak)

Exploring Glacier Bay National Park by Land (and Sea Kayak)

July 29, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 2 comments

   Where are the glaciers? That was our first question when we arrived at
   Glacier Bay National Park. As it turns out we didn’t have the typical
   experience here. In fact, we’re part of the 10% of park visitors that
   set foot on land in Glacier Bay National Park. The other 90% see the
   park from the deck of an Alaska cruise ship and spend just 8-10 hours
   in the park. Glacier Bay National Park is the first official national
   park…

   Our Favorite Things to Do in Sitka, Alaska

Our Favorite Things to Do in Sitka, Alaska

July 22, 2019 Tom Wasieleski Comments 2 comments

   We are super excited to share this destination guide from our road trip
   to Alaska. Our first stop is Sitka, Alaska. We chose Sitka because two
   of my college roommates (who I was well overdue for a visit with) live
   there and it was a perfect beginning to our Alaskan adventure. This
   small island city did not disappoint. There are tons of things to do in
   Sitka. We were lucky enough to spend a week and explore the nature,
   culture,…

Sitka Tribal Tours: An Introduction to Alaskan Culture

July 8, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 2 comments

   The first few weeks of travel in Alaska and Canada have been a wild
   ride both figuratively and literally. We’ve taken Stan the Tan Van on 6
   boat voyages, kayaked with sea lions (not intentionally, mind you),
   camped across from a glacier, celebrated Canada Day with a sour-toe
   cocktail (complete with a mummified human toe) in an old mining town,
   and US Independence Day at the crossroads of Tok, Alaska. Needless to
   say, we have a lot to share already…

   Guadalupe Mountains National Park: Hiking on an Ancient Sea Reef in the

Guadalupe Mountains National Park: Hiking on an Ancient Sea Reef in the Sky

June 24, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Guadalupe Mountains National Park is one of those parks that doesn’t
   get a lot of limelight. In fact, a few years ago, before we started our
   quest to visit all the US national parks, I hadn’t even heard of
   Guadalupe Mountains. It’s neighbor in New Mexico—Carlsbad Caverns—gets
   a lot more attention and when you think of a national park in Texas,
   it’s usually Big Bend that comes to mind. It may be due to its modest
   nature, but Guadalupe Mountains…

   24 Hours in Petrified Forest National Park

24 Hours in Petrified Forest National Park

June 10, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Petrified Forest National Park is a place where you can travel through
   time and literally see layers of earth’s geological and human history.
   The petrified wood of the park’s namesake are actually fossils from the
   Triassic Period—225 million years ago. Traces of human habitation here
   can be dated back over 13,000 years. And within the last hundred years
   there’s a rich history of our modern society’s interest in the
   Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. Before I get into the details…

   Day Trip to Boquillas del Carmen, Mexico from Big Bend National Park

Day Trip to Boquillas del Carmen, Mexico from Big Bend National Park

June 3, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   A Day in the Border Town of Boquillas del Carmen We’ve already
   established that Big Bend National Park in Texas is one of the most
   diverse, beautiful, and all-around kick-ass awesome parks we’ve been to
   yet. As I mentioned in my last post, a highlight of our time in Big
   Bend was taking a day trip across the border to the town of Boquillas
   del Carmen (often referred to as just Boquillas) in Mexico. The trip
   included a rowboat ride,…

   Four Million Acres of Solitude: Lake Clark National Park and Preserve

Four Million Acres of Solitude: Lake Clark National Park and Preserve

October 21, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Lake Clark National Park isn’t an easy place to get to. Without any
   access roads or ferry service, a bush plane flight or boat ride is
   required to get here. However, we found it well worth the effort. In
   fact, traveling to and from Lake Clark was one of our favorite
   experiences on our entire Alaska road trip. The rugged beauty and
   wildness here are astounding. Lake Clark National Park is home to
   active volcanoes, craggy jade mountains, glacial rivers,…

Carlsbad Caverns National Park: Our Favorite Things and Our Biggest Regrets

October 7, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   How’s that for a dramatic click-bait title? Don’t worry this isn’t
   click-bait—I wouldn’t do that do you. I fully intend to share (and
   likely over-share) just that: our favorite things to do in Carlsbad
   Caverns National Park and our biggest regrets from our time there
   earlier this year. How Was Carlsbad Caverns National Park Formed? Let’s
   start with a little history about how the cave was formed—or as I like
   to call it, “Liana’s geology geek-out time.” If you’ve read…

Backpacking Denali National Park: What You Need to Know

September 23, 2019 Liana Safian Comments 0 Comment

   Backpacking Denali National Park is a bucket list item for many outdoor
   enthusiasts. It’s also a great way to see the park beyond the
   established roads and trails. In fact, there aren’t any trails in much
   of Denali’s 6 million acres, so backpacking here is a true wilderness
   experience. Upon arrival in Denali National Park, we didn’t have any
   plans to spend a night in the great outdoors. However, after a few days
   of witnessing the vast landscape of rolling…
