   Three Internet Privacy Acts Every Publisher Should Know Three Internet
   Privacy Acts Every Publisher Should Know

Three Internet Privacy Acts Every Publisher Should Know

   Online, it can seem like the geographic borders of information and
   e-commerce are becoming more and more blurred. But as a digital
   publisher, if you're serving ads to audiences in the US, Canada, or the
   European Economic Area (EEA)^1, it's good to be aware of regional
   privacy and data collection, processing and disclosure laws, and how
   each change with different countries.
   With Sortable publishers seeing an average split of 40% US, 15% EEA,
   and 8% Canada traffic, we've rounded up some information privacy laws
   and personal information-handling practices that you should keep in
   mind, whether you're based in those countries, see visitors from there,
   or want to see traffic from there.

   On a serious note, complying with privacy laws and understanding the
   impending updates could help protect you from everything from fines and
   class action lawsuits to protecting your consumer confidence from a
   damaged brand reputation.
    1. EEA: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for Publishers
       What is it?
       GDPR came into effect May 25, 2018 and applies across the EEA. GDPR
       is considered the data processing standard”it takes a proactive,
       consent-first approach to the collection of data and analytics.
       Why should it matter to publishers?
       GDPR ensures that companies can't collect data without a lawful
       basis and a reason for processing. GDPR has the broadest definition
       of the personal data that it protects of any major privacy law, so
       if you collect any information from EEA-based users GDPR should be
       on your mind. Sites offering goods or services to EEA buyers, or
       tracking their online activities, are now required to obtain
       consent from users on the data they collect and with whom they
       share it with.  Consent Management Platforms, or CMPs, are used by
       many publishers to manage consent. (View trends in publisher
       decisions when it came time to implement GDPR).
    2. US: California Consumer Privacy Act for Publishers
       What is it?
       Scheduled to come into effect in January 2020, California's new
       privacy law AB 375 was signed in by unanimous votes in the summer
       of 2018. As the world's fifth largest economy at $2.7 trillion GDP,
       it's likely that businesses targeting US visitors will encounter
       California residents. Consequently, California could become the de
       facto approach for the US. While California's privacy law has
       passed, the Internet Association (a lobbying group that represents
       companies like Facebook, Google, Uber, Amazon, and Microsoft), the
       US Chamber of Commerce (the country's largest lobbying
       organization), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) are
       encouraging US federal lawmakers to enact a federal privacy law.
       They want to avoid the confusion and complications of having to
       navigate a separate privacy law for every state in the US.
       Why should it matter to publishers?
       The California Act gives consumers the right to decide which
       personal data is collected and for what purpose. It also allows
       them to opt out of having their data sold.
       Personal information as defined by the California Act are standard
       identifiers in the physical world (like driver's license or social
       security numbers), digital identifiers (like email addresses or
       demographic data), online behaviours (like IP, search, browsing
       history, purchases, and interactions), and any inferred data.
       The California Act isn't quite as rigorous as GDPR (the California
       Act doesn't require consent or permissions in the first place),
       instead focusing on a consumer's control of who sees their data.
       Where it differs from GDPR is the lack of a stop
       mechanism”companies can still collect information”and no initial
       consent is required.
       Publishers who use ad tech that track visitors around the web with
       cookies and mobile advertising IDs should be aware that the
       California Act requires that publishers have an option to give
       people a way to ask for deletion of the information collected. If
       that personal information is sold or shared, the company must
       disclose the purpose.
    3. Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
       Act (PIPEDA) for Publishers
       What is it?
       Canada's PIPEDA came into effect in June 2015, with updates
       scheduled for January 2019. PIPEDA protects personal information
       entrusted to commercial organizations. Personal information
       includes a person's age, name, ID numbers, income, ethnicity, blood
       type, comments, opinions, and employee records.
       Why should it matter to publishers?
       Targeting Canadians? Publishers will need to obtain their consent
       when they collect, use, or disclose the Canadian individual's
       personal information in the course of any commercial activity. The
       federal-level PIPEDA gives the user the right to access any
       personal information gathered, and be informed if that information
       is used for any other purpose than the original communicated
       intent.
       Like GDPR and the California Act, PIPEDA charges the publisher with
       protecting the personal information gathered, regardless of whether
       that is handled directly or by third parties. Interestingly, PIPEDA
       doesn't cover any business contact information that an organization
       collects, uses, or discloses for the purpose of communicating. And
       PIPEDA is one of several laws in Canada that relate to privacy
       rights.
       There are 10 principles for publishers to follow, which outline:
       accountability: identifying purposes; consent; limiting collection;
       limiting use, disclosure, and retention; accuracy; safeguards;
       openness; individual access; and challenging compliance.
       Any publisher that breaches PIPEDA could face fines of up to
       $100,000 CAD.

   Conclusion:

   There you have it, three major privacy acts you need to know about as a
   publisher in high economic demand areas. Privacy laws are complex and
   this article is meant as an overview, not a replacement for legal
   advice.

   by gathering audience data under consent so you can expand and grow
   your business globally. Book a demo with our compliance experts today.

   Footnote: What is the European Union (EU) and the European Economic
   Area (EEA)?

   There's some confusion as to what the EEA is, versus the EU. The
   European Union (EU) is a union of 28 member countries and both a
   political and economic grouping. (Source: https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea)

   The European Economic Area includes EU member countries and includes
   countries from the Scandinavian region. We've listed it in a handy

The Value of Exchange Bidding

   August 26, 2019

   Exchange bidding, also known as Exchange Bidding in Dynamic Allocation
   (EBDA), is a server-side unified auction where ad exchanges and SSPs
   compete with Google Ad Exchange to win impressions. Exchange bidding
   was Google’s response to header bidding and the need to reduce the
   complexity of header bidding.  Prior to switching to a first-price
   auction, Google Ad Exchange had the “last ... Read More

Optimize with Lazy Loading

   August 15, 2019

   Normally when a user opens a webpage, the ads for the entire page are
   downloaded and rendered all at once. While this allows the browser to
   cache the whole web page, there's no guarantee that the user will
   actually view all of the downloaded ads. Instead of bulk loading all of
   the ads when the page is accessed, you can ... Read More

What you need to know about header bidding

   July 5, 2019

   Header bidding is a programmatic advertising technique that allows
   publishers to offer their inventory to multiple ad exchanges
   simultaneously before sending requests to ad servers (ie. Google Ad
   Manager).  Header bidding evolved from waterfall bidding, which was a
   popular, but inefficient form of auctioning ad space. During a
   waterfall auction, publishers would offer their ad space from ad

   forecast and predict revenue. As we move into July and August,
   publishers in the northern-Atlantic regions, like North America and
   Europe,  may experience one of their weakest quarters of the fiscal
   year. There's no need to panic”this is a common ... Read More
