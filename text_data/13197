The Sweetest Season

   October 7, 2019

   Summit Creek Project Kitchen / build: Split Rock Custom Homes /

   October ushers in The Sweetest Season. It’s the month where the weather
   turns crisp, colors turn rich, and we anticipate welcoming friends and
   family into our homes over the upcoming holidays. Today we are
   partnering with Walmart to share how simple updates featuring neutral
   color and warm metals can add the perfect subtle pop of fall to your
   home, while helping your prepare for holiday visitors.

   Our favorite way to welcome guests is with a warm inviting kitchen. It
   is the space where everyone can gather to bake, visit, and enjoy the
   scents and tastes of the season. At Walmart we found what we needed to
   stock the kitchen of our Summit Creek Project. We added a canister of
   wooden spoons that add warmth and texture, a beautiful marble rolling
   pin, and stacks of modern white ceramic dishes. The tools are useful,
   but also add a welcoming lived-in vibe to your space with subtle
   texture and warmth.

   Walmart Home has beautiful finds at everyday low prices. Plus, Walmart
   makes it easy with free two-day shipping for most orders over $35 and
   free returns. We love this. It allows us to order several options to
   try in a space before finalizing our styling.

   Today we shopped a roundup of finds that will ensure your kitchen is
   well stocked and warmly styled in time for holiday visitors. Check out
   what caught our eye below and then browse more beautiful fall hosting
   finds here.

       amazing rattan bed + and Extra 30% off sale clothing! Check out the

       tones and soft pastels. Get it now for 25% off + Free Shipping as a

    3. This felt fedora is a fall staple. Even though summer is over, we
       still need sun protection! Pair it with your denim, tees and
       sweaters to achieve effortless style.
    4. This new sweater is the perfect camel color to wear with denim.
       It’s priced really well too!
    5. I’ve got a great tip for you….Every bed needs a quilt from the
       Parachute bedding line. It’s my new favorite discovery for creating
       an incredibly comfortable, cozy bed. My girlfriend told me about
       her favorite quilt, “The Cloud Quilt.” I ordered it and now I’m
       obsessed. It’s the perfect weight that transitions well into cooler
       months, and it’s made of incredibly soft Turkish cotton. So soft
       and fluffy! Plus, I love how it looks styled in a bedroom.
    6.  This classic stripe vintage pillow is a great neutral for your
       spaces.
    7. Pair with with something in a fun patterned pillow for a cozy, fall
       look.
    8. This “Ryder” denim rug has been a client favorite for a long time.
       It’s beautiful quality and a great design that works well in both
       modern and traditional spaces. It’s on sale now as a part of the
       Serena and Lily Friends and Family Sale. Get it for 20% off with
       code: GUESTPREP! Use it in a hallway or kitchen as a runner or get
       it in large sizes for a living area. Grab it for a good deal now
       while you can!
    9. My favorite denim is currently on sale. I wear these jeans multiple
       times a week. They are flattering, live-in jeans. They will be your
       go-to denim!
