The event

   …to meet Europe´s best

   Only the best teams and the most excellent players reach the DELO
   WOMEN'S EHF FINAL4 on 9/10 May 2020 after a tough and challenging
   season. This is your chance not only to see them play, but also ask for
   autographs and maybe – if you’re lucky – even high-five them after the
   matches.

   …to live and breathe handball

   Never before has a handball match been such an amazing experience. You
   will feel like almost being on the court yourself, the spotlight
   focussing straight in your face when you enter the field of play. You
   will hear the players shouting from one end of the court to the other –
   but it feels like as if they were shouting directly at you. And when
   your favourite team scores and wins, you know that coming here has been
   the right decision.


   …to cheer as loud as you have never done before

   The DELO WOMEN'S EHF FINAL4 is not the place to settle back in your
   comfy chair and relax. Your team will need your support, if it wants to
   go all the way to the top of the podium. So cheer, scream, wave and
   clap as loud as possible – be sure the players down at the court will
   hear it and get this extra boost they might need.


   …to experience a unique show

   The shows before every game, the music that is pumping, the
   performances on court, the thrill of four do-or-die matches – all this
   culminates over two days and when the final whistle blown, emotions
   burst out. The DELO WOMEN'S EHF FINAL4 is something you don’t want to
   miss.

   Come to Budapest for the DELO WOMEN'S EHF FINAL4 and be part of the
   experience!



Budapest

   Hungary's capital is divided into two parts by the River Danube in a
   north-south direction: the hilly northern bank is called Buda, while
   the flat eastern bank is called Pest. The two parts were merged in 1873
   and the city became known as Budapest.


   World Heritage wherever you go

   Many parts of Budapest are listed by the UNESCO World Heritage
   Committee, including the view of the Danube embankments and the Buda
   Castle District, which is one of the most beautiful and romantic parts
   of Budapest.

   Furthermore both the Pest and the Buda embankments of the Danube
   stretching from Liberty Bridge all the way up to Margaret Bridge, the
   area around the Chain Bridge, some of the buildings belonging to the
   Budapest University of Technology and Economics, the Gellért Bath, the
   Gellért Hill with its Statue of Liberty and the Citadel, the Castle of
   Buda, the Baroque churches and Turkish baths of the so-called 'Water
   Town' are all part of the world heritage list.

   On the Pest embankment world heritage buildings and sights include the
   Parliament, Széchenyi Square, the Academy of Sciences and the Gresham
   Palace. The Heroes' Square along with its surroundings and Andrássy
   Avenue with the first underground in Europe, the Millennium Underground
   Railway, have also become part of the UNESCO list.


   From coffee houses to world cuisine

   With Hungarian cuisine known for being among the best and richest in
   Europe, Budapest is famous for its excellent food. Traditional
   Hungarian food has an unmistakable character, often rich in sour cream,
   onions, eggs, butter, fresh produce and wine. However, there is a great
   selection of world cuisine restaurants in the city as well. And for all
   sweet lovers out there, Budapest is also home to hundreds of coffee
   houses – some modern, some antique – offering cakes and delicious
   cakes.

   Sports, sports, sports

   Budapest has hosted many international sport events over the past few
   years as athletes from all over the world competed in European and
   World Championships in the Papp László Budapest Sportaréna.

   The city organised the Swimming European Championships as well as judo,
   wrestling, pentathlon and ice hockey (first division) World
   Championships. In 2004 and in 2014 the Women's EHF EURO was and will be
   held in Hungary's capital. Furthermore Budapest is home to the winners
   of 2011 and the 2012 Cup Winners’ Cup in women’s handball, FTC-Rail
   Cargo Hungaria.


Papp László Budapest Sportaréna

   László Papp, the iconic sportsman

   The arena is named after legendary Hungarian boxer László Papp who won
   consecutive gold at the 1948, 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games, making him
   one of the world’s most successful athletes in boxing.

   Born out of flames

   In December 1999 the former Budapest Sportaréna, which was built in the
   same location, burnt to the ground. The catastrophe shook the public in
   Hungary as the arena had been the country’s only one capable of holding
   several thousands of people at sports and cultural events. Decisions
   were made quickly to build a new arena. Construction began in June 2001
   and one year and a half later, in March 2003, the new Sportaréna opened
   its doors to the public.

   Is it a horseshoe or a stone?

   The arena attracts with its unique design which is sometimes referred
   to as a horseshoe and sometimes as a stone. The former focusses on the
   interior as the arena’s permanent tribunes run along the two long, but
   only along one short side, whereas stone is more apt with regards to
   the arena’s outside appearance. But either way, it is simply stunning
   no matter what it is called.

   “Let me entertain you”

   By bringing the best international acts such as Kylie Minogue, Pink,
   Robbie Williams, top quality family shows such as “Disney on Ice” and a
   variety of other special events to the Hungarian and Central European
   audiences, the arena puts itself among the most sought-after venues in
   the entertainment business.


   The citadel of sport

   Papp László Budapest Sportaréna has also made a name for itself as a
   grand venue for sport events. It hosted the Women’s EHF EURO 2004 and
   has also been the venue for numerous basketball and ice hockey matches
   as well as for gymnastics and athletics championships. 2014 was ‘the
   years of handball’ for the arena with the MVM EHF FINAL4 in May 2014,
   as well as the Final Weekend of the Women’s EHF EURO in December. The
   DELO WOMEN’S EHF FINAL4 will return for the seventh time on 9/10 May
   2020.

   • The year the first Sportarena burnt down: 1999

   • The building complex is as heavy as the Erzsébet and the Szabadság
