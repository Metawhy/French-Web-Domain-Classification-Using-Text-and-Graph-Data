Social Media Day

   ‚ÄúI attended your Pinterest session at the #SMDH19. It was the best
   session I saw that day.  Great presentation of the key facts to know
   about Pinterest and also how to strategically approach that platform.
   Kudos to you!‚Äù
   Sebastian Hahn

Pinterest Inspiration

   "I'm a makeup artist and I know Pinterest is a huge benefit, but I‚Äôve
   just been too intimidated to jump in, but you‚Äôve really inspired me!"
