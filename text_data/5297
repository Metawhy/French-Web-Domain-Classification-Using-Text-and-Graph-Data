   Who We Are...

   We are SISO! The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization
   (SISO) is an international organization dedicated to the promotion of
   modeling and simulation interoperability and reuse for the benefit of a
   broad range of M&S communities including developers, procurers, and
   users world-wide.

   DID YOU KNOW...
   In 2003 the IEEE Computer Society Standards Activities Board approved
   SISO SAC as the Computer/Simulation Interoperability (C/SI) Standards
   Committee. In 2015 the IEEE Standards Association Standards Board
   re-authorized C/SI for standards development. The SISO SAC Chair or
   Vice-Chair serve as SISO's primary contact for all IEEE Standards
   activities...Read More
