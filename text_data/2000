   "Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything,
   it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing."
   [sylvia-plath-1.jpg]
   "Dying is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I
   do it so it feels like hell.
   I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call."
   - Sylvia Plath -

   [Alexander-McQueen-by-Ezra-Petronio.jpg]
   "There is a hidden agenda in the fragility of romance."
   [Alexander-McQueen-by-Nigel-Parry.jpg]
   "I just want to be a wallflower. Nondescript. Just not anything. I
   don't want to see me."
   - Alexander McQueen -
