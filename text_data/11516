What is Joomla?

   Joomla is a user-friendly way for people all over the world to build
   anything from basic websites to advanced web applications. It is
   considered a Content Management System (CMS) and currently runs 10% of
   the world’s business websites.

Launch.joomla.org How it works?

   Your fully functional Joomla website will be hosted on the
   CloudAccess.net Platform, it even includes FTP, PHPMyAdmin, and the
   ability to install extensions. You can keep it as long as you login and
   click a “renew” button once every 30 days. The only limitations are
   500MB of disk space, subdomain usage, and your imagination... but fear
   not, you can upgrade to remove the first two limitations starting at
   only $5/mo.
