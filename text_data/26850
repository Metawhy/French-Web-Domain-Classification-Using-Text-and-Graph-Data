13 Best Log Management & Analysis Tools

   Tools

   Log files will tell you what went wrong when the system suddenly stops
   working. They will also help you track any system changes and can even
   help you enforce the security of your network. Log files are such an
   important element of your network administration information sources
   that there are tools produced specifically to help you manage them.

   We get into the details of each of the tools that made it to this
   article below, but in case you only have time for a quick roundup,
   here’s our list of the best log management tools:
    1. SolarWinds Security Event Manager (FREE TRIAL) This tool
       automatically generates HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, ISO, NCUA, FISMA,
       FERPA, GLBA, NERC CIP, GPG13, DISA STIG reports.
    2. Paessler PRTG Network Monitor (FREE TRIAL) This monitoring system
       covers networks, servers, and applications; it includes a Windows
       Event Log sensor and a Syslog Receiver.
    3. SolarWinds Papertrail (FREE PLAN) Cloud-based service has file
       content filtering capabilities and can extract records by date to
       help you with your event management tasks.
    4. ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer (FREE TRIAL) A SIEM tool that hunts
       for intruder threats. Installs on Windows, Windows Server or Linux.
    5. Loggly (FREE TRIAL) A cloud-based log analyzer that transfers data
       to remote servers for analysis. Available in free and paid
       versions.
    6. Splunk Comprehensive log management system for macOS, Linux, and
       Windows.
    7. Fluentd Cloud-based hub for log file information gathered by an
       agent on your system.
    8. Logstash Part of the free Elastic Stack, this is a log data
       gathering tool.
    9. Kibana This is the data viewing application of Elastic Stack;
       commands available with Kibana include basic file management that
       can split out any log file by date.
   10. Graylog Free, open-source log file-based system for Ubuntu, Debian,
       CentOS, and SUSE Linux.
   11. XpoLog This utility can analyze data from Apache server logs, AWS,
       Windows and Linux event logs, and Microsoft IIS.
   12. ManageEngine Syslog Forwarder A free log message manager for
       Windows that can filter out irrelevant, mundane, or unimportant log
       messages.
   13. Managelogs A free, open source utility to manage Apache web server
       logs.

   Once you find a log management tool that you like you will grow to be
   dependent on it for a range of admin tasks, including Security
   Information and Event Management (SIEM) and real-time monitoring of
   your network and its equipment. If your favorite tool goes out of
   production, you will need to find a replacement quickly to enable you
   to continue to manage event logs and sort through all of your log data.

The best log management tools for Windows, Linux, and Mac

   Unfortunately, Analog was discontinued back in 2010 but you may find
   our following list of log management and analysis tools useful to help
   you find an alternative. Our criteria in selecting the following tools
   are mainly their robustness in diverse industry use cases, the ease of
   use and installation, extensive documentation and support, and overall
   performance and features.

1. SolarWinds Security Event Manager (FREE TRIAL)

   Solarwinds Log and Event Manager Solarwinds Log and Event Manager

   Unlike Cronolog, the SolarWinds Security Event Manager isn’t free.
   However, you can get access to it on a 30-day free trial. This is a
   very comprehensive log management system and it would be particularly
   useful for large organizations. It will enable your real-time
   monitoring and help you locate each event log quickly.

   This software runs on the Windows Server operating system, but it is
   not limited to managing logged events that only arise on Windows. The
   manager is a cross-platform utility that will deal with all of your
   system logging tasks, no matter which operating system they come from.

   An amazing feature of this log manager is that it will verify the
   information in your log files by separately tracking live data. This is
   a great security feature in these days of advanced persistent threats
   when hackers regularly change log files to cover their tracks. This is
   an example of how the SolarWinds Security Event Manager extends beyond
   the historical need to check what happened when things go wrong.

   Today, log file management has become a function of system security and
   data integrity routines. Thanks to the EU’s new GDPR requirements, data
   protection has become a vitally important system administration
   priority. The need to patch data leaks quickly makes log files a
   primary source of information. Extra features of this tool include USB
   memory stick management and event analysis functions.

   This log manager is also a good choice for sites that require standards
   compliance. The Log and Event Manager automatically generates HIPAA,
   PCI DSS, SOX, ISO, NCUA, FISMA, FERPA, GLBA, NERC CIP, GPG13, DISA STIG
   reports to demonstrate compliance, or highlight gaps for remedial
   action.

   Security-sensitive sites need a lot more from their log management
   software than Cronolog could offer. So, if you are looking for a
   replacement utility and you also need SIEM features, think about what
   your company needs now from a log management system, not what you could
   get away with back when Cronolog was first written.

2. Paessler PRTG Network Monitor (FREE TRIAL)

   PRTG Log Monitoring PRTG Log Monitoring

   Paessler PRTG Network Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring tool for
   networks, servers, and applications. Log management is an important
   part of systems administration and so Paessler made sure to include a
   log monitoring section in PRTG.

   Each monitoring interface in PRTG is called a sensor. There are two
   sensors that manage logs. These are the Windows Event Log sensor and
   the Syslog Receiver sensor.

PRTG Windows Event Log Sensor

   The Event Log Windows API sensor catches all of the log messages that a
   Windows system generates. This includes application alerts and
   operating system notifications. The sensor monitors the rate of log
   messages rather than the contents of each message. However, it does
   categorize those alarms by source or event type. The sensor will
   generate an alarm in the dashboard if the rate of event log messages
   escalates. Those notifications can be sent to you in the form of an
   email or an SMS message. You can customize alert notifications so that
   they are sent to different team members according to severity or
   source.

PRTG Syslog Receiver Sensor

   PRTG syslog receiver sensor PRTG syslog receiver sensor

   The Syslog Receiver sensor receives, monitors, and saves syslog
   messages. This gives you a syslog file management tool, but the sensor
   isn’t just a passive file creation function. The monitoring element of
   the receiver’s duties generates alarms if worrying conditions arise,
   such as an increase in the rate of file creation. You can set the
   conditions that trigger alerts and you can decide to whom and how
   notifications are delivered.

   Paessler PRTG is free to monitor up to 100 sensors. If you want to use
   the tool to monitor your entire network, you will need a lot more
   sensors and that level of service is charged for. You can get a 30-day
   free trial with unlimited sensors.

3. Papertrail (FREE PLAN)

   Papertrail screenshot Papertrail screenshot

   Papertrail is a log management system produced by SolarWinds, a leading
   network software producer. The main purpose behind Papertrail is to
   centralize all log file data in one place, so it is a log aggregator.
   That makes it markedly different from Coronolog, a logfile parser. That
   said, Papertrail’s file content filtering capabilities can extract
   records by date to help you with your event management tasks.

   You can use Papertrail to examine a range of log files, including
   Windows events, Ruby on Rails program messages, router and firewall
   notifications, and Apache server log files. The service is cloud-based,
   so you don’t need to worry whether it will run on your operating
   system. You access the dashboard through your web browser.

   The price for the service varies depending on the search volume that
   you put through it. There is a free plan that gives you a data
   throughput allowance of 100 MB per month. That is not very much, but if
   you limit your service coverage to just Apache logs, you might be able
   to get away with it. The cheapest paid plan gives you a data allowance
   of 1 GB per month at a price of $7. The paid plans work on a
   subscription basis and you pay a monthly fee.

   Each plan lets you view a period of data and allows you to archive data
   for a different length of time. For example, the free service lets you
   operate on data from the last 48 hours and you can archive data for
   seven days. This would be enough to emulate Cronolog, because for that,
   you only need to look at one day’s worth of data at a time.

4. ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer (FREE TRIAL)

   ManageEngine Event Log Analyzer ManageEngine Event Log Analyzer

   The ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer is more than a log file server. It
   is an intrusion detection system that looks for threats to the network.

   Just about every piece of equipment and software in your business
   generates log messages periodically and in response to exceptional
   events. The EventLog Analyzer catches these messages as they move
   around the network and stores them to file.

   The main source of messages is the Windows Event Log system and Syslog
   messages that arrive from Linux systems. The EventLog Analyzer also
   picks up log messages from Apache Web Server, database systems,
   firewalls, network equipment and security software.

   Once log messages are stored in files, they need to be archived
   periodically. The files have to be organized in a logical manner, which
   makes the events of specific dates easy to access. The EventLog
   Analyzer handles all of that log file management work. As a source of
   disclosure on unauthorized activity, log files are often targeted by
   hackers to remove traces of their intrusion. The EventLog Manager
   monitors changes to logs and blocks unauthorized access.

   Log data is a rich source of information on the status of your system
   equipment. The analysis module of the EventLog Analyzer uses log
   information to audit user access to critical resources. This is
   particularly important in the hunt for intruders. Intrusion might not
   just be the unauthorized access by outsiders, but it could also be
   inappropriate data access by staff.

   The EventLog Analyzer also audits the activities of applications,
   checking on the operations of Web servers, DHCP servers, databases and
   other essential services in your system. The information culled from
   these monitoring activities is important for performance statuses as
   well as for security.

   The ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer installs on Windows, Windows Server
   and RHEL, Mandrake, SUSE, Fedora, and CentOS Linux. This is a paid
   product, but there is also a free edition, which gathers logs from up
   to five sources. You can get a 30-day free trial of the Premium
   Edition. A networked version, called the Distributed Edition is also
   available for a 30-day free trial.

5. Loggly (FREE TRIAL)

   Loggly events Loggly events

   Loggly is a log consolidator that is based in the cloud. This online
   service also offers log analysis facilities. A big advantage of this
   cloud-based approach is that you don’t need to maintain any software in
   order to use the utility. Your on-premises system needs to be
   coordinated to the Loggly service so that it will upload your standard
   log files periodically to the online server.

   As a consolidator, Loggly reformats the uploaded log file records into
   a standard format. This allows the analyzer to process records from
   several different sources and enables you to track events across your
   system, regardless of the operating system or methodology that
   generated those event records. The sources of log file messages aren’t
   limited to your on premises servers. It is also able to process records
   generated by online servers, such as AWS and it can include messages
   created by applications such as Docker and Logstash.

   A possible point of vulnerability in this operating model lies in the
   transfer of data. However, you no doubt already use a protected file
   transfer system, such as FTPS. The TLS protection embedded in that
   standard will protect your data during uploads. TLS also covers data
   transfers from the Loggly server to your browser, through the HTTPS
   protocol.

   The Loggly service is offered in three service plans. The entry-level
   package is free to use. This is called Loggly Lite. Each plan has a
   data processing limit and you might find that the limits on the free
   service do not give you enough space for your log data. You are allowed
   to upload 200 MB of log data per day with Loggly Lite and the system
   will retain each record for seven days.

   The Standard package of Loggly gives you an upload allowance of 1 GB
   per day and stores each record for 30 days. You also get multiple user
   account access with the paid packages. With the Standard package, you
   can have three user accounts. The higher paid package has no limit to
   the number of users you can set up on your account. That plan, which is
   called Loggly Enterprise, is a bespoke package with prices depending on
   the amount of upload capacity and the storage period that you require.

   Loggly is a subscription service, which you can pay for annually or
   monthly. You can get a 14-day free trial of the Standard plan. If you
   decide not to continue with this plan at the end of the trial period,
   your account will be switched automatically to the free Loggly Lite
   plan.

6. Splunk

   Splunk screenshot Splunk screenshot

   Splunk is a comprehensive log management system for macOS, Linux, and
   Windows. The system is a well-known utility within the system
   administration community. Splunk, Inc produces three versions of its
   network data monitoring software. The top-of-the-line version is called
   Splunk Enterprise, which costs $173 per month. This is a network
   management system rather than just a log file organizer. Fortunately,
   Splunk is also available for free, making it into our list of Cronolog
   alternatives.

   The free Splunk is restricted to input file analysis. You can feed in
   any of your standard logs or funnel live data through a file into the
   analyzer. The free utility can only have one user account and its data
   throughput is limited to 500 MB per day. The system doesn’t explicitly
   deal with network alerts, but you could force that functionality by
   getting alerts written to a file and then bounced into Splunk.

   A data sorting and filtering utility is built into Splunk, and you can
   write out to files from the analyzer. These features can emulate
   Cronolog by dividing log records by date and writing each group out to
   new files.

7. Fluentd

   Fluentd screenshot Fluentd screenshot

   Like Cronolog, Fluentd runs on Linux systems — Debian, CentOS, and
   Ubuntu. It can also be installed on Mac OS, Amazon Linux, RHEL, and
   Windows. This cloud-based utility acts as a hub for log file
   information gathered by an agent on your system. The tool can collect
   live data streams to create log files as well as monitor and manage
   existing files. One of the data sources that Fluentd is written to
   manage is the logging system of Apache.

   Results from log record analysis can be made to trigger alerts, but
   these have to be processed by Nagios, or a Nagios-based monitoring
   system. Fluentd is an open-source project, so you can download the
   source code. This tool is free to use.

   The Fluentd website is the source for the program and it is also the
   location of community pages where you can get help and advice on
   running the tool from other users. The core package can be extended
   through plugins written by other community members. Those plugins are
   usually free of charge.

   You can use many other free interfaces as a front end for Fluentd, such
   as Kibana. The Fluentd utility can also be integrated with tools that
   include Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and InfluxDB for analysis.

8. Logstash

   Logstash screenshot Logstash screenshot

   Logstash is a log creation facility produced by Elastic. This Dutch
   software organization has created a range of data exploration products
   that link together in the “Elastic Stack.” This suite of programs is
   open source and each product is available for free. The core element of
   the Elastic Suite is Elasticsearch. This is a searching and sorting
   utility that can process data from several files into unified results.
   Elasticsearch can be integrated into other tools and is available for
   use with many of the other utilities in this list.

   Logstash is the Elastic Stack’s data gathering tool. The functions of
   Logstash can be tailored to emulate Cronolog. The facility creates
   source files for analysis by other tools, such as Elasticsearch. The
   power of this tool is that it can collate data from several different
   sources. However, if you If want to reorganize your Apache log files,
   there is no reason why you can’t limit the data search to just one
   source log file.

   The capabilities of Logstash include file parsing, so you can use this
   function to split up your log files by date. The output of Logstash can
   be formatted to suit a long list of utilities for analysis or display.
   It can also be written to a plain text file on disk, which is exactly
   what Cronolog used to do.

9. Kibana

   Kibana screenshot Kibana screenshot

   Elastic produces Kibana, which is a great free front end for any data
   gathering tool. Other useful tools in this list can funnel data to
   Kibana, so you don’t have to rely just on the other Elastic Stack
   programs to source data for this application.

   The full capabilities of Kibana go way beyond the file parsing function
   of Cronolog. However, the wide range of commands available with Kibana
   include basic file management that can split out any log file by date.
   Kibana has a command language console that lets you create scripts and
   programs to process files. However, if you don’t have programming
   skills, the preset data manipulation facilities of the interface give
   you a lot of powerful data sorting and filtering utilities that will
   help you manage your log files.

   The interface includes time-based analysis tools including filters, so
   you can easily isolate records in a log file that relate to a specific
   date. Raw data, graphs, and other visualizations can be written out to
   files or used to generate reports. Standard reports can be scheduled to
   run periodically, so creating a filter by date and setting it to run
   daily and output to a plain text file would give you exactly the same
   results that you used to get from Cronolog.

   The benefit of using Kibana is that it can give much more assistance
   than Cronolog could. You can compare data from different sources and
   visualize the information from all of your system log files to analyze
   performance and forecast capacity requirements. To get a full data
   management facility, you should probably use Logstash to collate source
   data, Elasticsearch to sort data, and Kibana to display results. Kibana
   has plenty of data sourcing and manipulation facilities, so it could be
   used as a standalone data analysis tool.

10. Graylog

   Graylog screenshot Graylog screenshot

   Graylog is a free, open-source log file-based system that can give you
   a lot more functionality than just a log archiving utility. This log
   analyzer has a graphical user interface and it can run on Ubuntu,
   Debian, CentOS, and SUSE Linux. You can also run it on a virtual
   machine on Microsoft Windows and you can install the Graylog system on
   Amazon AWS.

   This log management facility can work with any logs. You can feed data
   into it from other sources by channeling system reports into a file,
   thus creating your own logs. The interface doesn’t acquire copies of
   logs, but sits on live logs, updating the information that feeds into
   the analyzing engine as new records are written to the log.

   Action scripts can forward log data to the screen, to other logs, or on
   to other applications. The dashboard shows data in the form of
   histograms, pie charts, line graphs, and color-coded lists. The
   interface includes a search and query function, which allows you to
   filter log records to get information on specific types of events or
   specific sources.

   The Graylog processes aggregate data to simplify displays on the
   Dashboard’s Home page and also to enable alert conditions to be
   specified across data sources and over time. Those overall views of
   data are not your only option because you can drill down and see the
   detailed records that created a summary. This makes Graylog a data
   mining tool.

   Alert conditions can be customized and you can write actions to be
   performed in the event of alerts arising. These actions include
   executing scripts or notifying specific team members by email or by
   Slack message.

   This is an amazing and very comprehensive tool that can automate your
   log file processing and automatically execute fault resolution.

11. XpoLog

   XpoLog screenshot XpoLog screenshot The two essential elements of
   Cronolog are that it could split up log files by date and that it could
   be run automatically. XpoLog includes both those functions. This is a
   great improvement on Cronolog, however, because XpoLog includes a lot
   of other functionality. It is a vast improvement on that discontinued
   log parsing tool.

   XpoLog can analyze data from a range of sources, including Apache
   server logs, AWS, Windows and Linux event logs, and Microsoft IIS. The
   utility can be installed on Mac OS X 10.11, macOS 10.12 and 10.13,
   Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016,
   Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. The software can also be installed on Linux
   Kernel 2.6 and later. You can opt for a cloud-based version if you
   don’t want to install the software. You can access it through Chrome,
   Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge.

   Apart from straightforward log file management, the XpoLog analysis
   engine detects unauthorized file access and helps optimize application
   and hardware usage. XpoLog gathers data from selected sources and will
   monitor those files that you include in its scope. Once data is
   centralized, XpoLog merges all data sources and creates its own
   database of records. Those records can be searched and filtered for
   analysis, and results can be written out to files. That functionality
   offers the same file parsing as Cronolog. Results can be written out to
   files or retained as archives for viewing through the XpoLog dashboard.

   XpoLog is available for free. If you just want to split up your Apache
   log files, then the free version will be good enough. To deal with
   larger volumes of data and employ the system for analysis, then you
   might have to step up to one of the paid plans.

   The free version allows you to process up to 1 GB of data per day, and
   the system will retain that data for five days. You could always write
   out the records to text files to get around that five day limit. The
   cheapest paid plan offers exactly the same data throughput limit and
   data retention period as the free service, so it is difficult to see
   why anyone would pay the $9 per month price tag for that package. More
   expensive plans give you an unlimited data retention period, with the
   cheapest unlimited option including an allowance of 1GB data throughput
   per day for $39 per month. You get progressively larger daily data
   throughput allowances at each price point. The top plan gives you a
   data throughput of 8GB per day and costs $534 per month.  You have to
   pay for the service annually in advance, even though it is priced per
   month. You can also buy a perpetual license.

12. ManageEngine Syslog Forwarder

   ManageEngine Syslog Forwarder ManageEngine Syslog Forwarder

   The Syslog Forwarder runs on the Windows operating system and it is
   completely free to use. It intercepts syslog records and forwards them
   on to different syslog servers, according to a rule base. The functions
   of the forwarder let you filter out irrelevant, mundane, or unimportant
   log messages. All blocked messages are sent to the original log file,
   but don’t get sent on to an end log file.

   The rule base of the Syslog Forwarder allows you to write to new log
   files each day, thus emulating the functionality of Cronolog. The big
   difference between Syslog Forwarder and Cronolog is that this existing
   log manager runs on Windows with a GUI interface, whereas Cronolog was
   a command line function for Unix and Linux systems.

13. Managelogs

   Managelogs website Managelogs website

   Probably the closest alternative to Cronolog, Managelogs is written in
   “C.” Not only is the utility free, but the source code is available for
   you to read through. The program is specifically designed to manage
   Apache web server logs.

   Managelogs has different operating modes activated by the variables
   specified when launching the program. You can set the utility to
   archive log files by date, or you can specify a maximum file size,
   which will copy over the log file to a new name and then clear out the
   current log file so it can start again from scratch and build up new
   records.

   If you specify that logs should be split by date, Managelogs will
   ensure that files are consolidated across sessions, so stopping and
   restarting the server manager won’t wipe out existing records on an
   incomplete day.

DIY log archiving

   You can write your own copy of Cronolog as a script for Unix or
   Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS. Although there
   are plenty of clever things you can do with regular expressions and
   pattern matching to pick out records for a specific date, the easiest
   way to get log archives per day is to write a copy script and then
   schedule it to run at midnight. If the last instructions in the script
   remove the existing file, new records will accumulate in a separate
   file throughout the day, to be archived off again at midnight.
   DATE=`date +%Y%m%d`
   MV=/usr/bin/mv
   LOGDIR=/opt/apache/logs
   LOGARCH=/www/logs
   FILES=”access_log error_log”
   CP=/usr/bin/cp
   for f in $FILES
   do
   $CP $LOGDIR/$f $LOGARCH/$f.$DATE.log
   $MV $LOGDIR/$f $LOGDIR/$f.$DATE.saved
   done
   cat /dev/null > /opt/apache/logs/access_log

Replace Cronolog

   Don’t get stressed that cronolog.org is no longer operating or that
   none of the download sites that used to deliver Cronolog no longer list
   it. Cronolog was not that great, and you could quite easily write your
   own version in just a couple of minutes.

   Log management utilities are very useful and despite the limited
   capabilities of Cronolog, many systems administrators came to rely on
   its services. As you can see from this review, many other log
   management tools not only give you the ability to parse your log files
   by date, but also give you some amazing data visualization and analysis
   features.

   Every one of the recommendations in our list of Cronolog replacements
   can be used or tried for free. All of these facilities give you better
   service than the do-it-yourself replication of Cronolog. Try out any of
   these tools and see which of them gives you the extra features needed
   to improve log and facilities management.

How to delete all of your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram posts

   Do you need to delete all of your posts on Facebook, Twitter, or
   Instagram? It's not as straightforward as you might think. Read on to
   find out how you can delete your posts in bulk with the help of apps
   and browser extensions.

   How to delete all of your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram posts How to
   delete all of your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram posts

   There is a range of reasons you might want to bulk delete all of your
   social media posts. Perhaps you’re job-hunting and want to make sure
   nothing mars your squeaky-clean reputation. Or you’re dating someone
   new and reminders of old relationships are not what you want popping up
   on Facebook. Maybe you run a business that’s going through a rebranding
   and you want to start your social media pages from scratch.

   Of course, one simple solution is to deactivate your account and start
   over. However, this means you lose all friends and followers, and any
   other public or private information you have associated with your
   account. That leaves deleting unwanted posts from your account. The
   problem is that if you have thousands of posts to get rid of, deleting
   them one by one can be seriously time-consuming, not to mention
   tedious. Thankfully, for many social media sites, there are workarounds
   that enable you to delete posts in bulk.

   In this article, we’ll explore your main options for some of the most
   popular sites (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).

How to delete all Facebook Posts

   Want to wipe your Facebook Page or profile? Here are your options:

Delete Facebook Profile posts

   When it comes to your Facebook profile, the platform’s built-in
   settings only enable you to delete one at a time. Here’s how to do
   that:
     * Find the post on your timeline.
     * Click the three dots in the upper right corner of the post.
     * Click Delete.

   An alternative option allows you to sort posts by specific categories.
   Go to Activity Log and select a filter. Then you can click the pencil
   icon next to each post and select Delete. You can still only delete one
   post at a time using this method.

   It is possible to delete posts in bulk from Facebook profiles using a
   browser extension. One such plugin is Social Book Post Manager for
   Chrome, which is free to use. It enables you to batch-delete profile
   posts, as well as carry out other batch actions such as hiding or
   unhiding multiple posts.

   Here’s how to use Social Book Post Manager:
     * Install Social Book Post Manager in your Chrome browser.
     * Open your Facebook profile and click Activity Log. Choose a filter
       on the left side of the page. You can choose Activity Log (which
       shows all activities) or one of the other filters, such as Posts
       You’re Tagged In or Hidden From Timeline.
     * Open the Social Book Post Manager extension. Note that if you try
       to open the extension when you’re not in your Activity Log, you
       will be prompted to navigate to the correct page. When opened, the
       plugin looks like this:

   The Social Book Post Manager interface. The Social Book Post Manager
   interface.
     * In the extension, you’ll see a series of fields including Year,
       Month, Text Contains, and Text Not Contains. There is also a
       Prescan on Page checkbox (check this to review posts before
       deletion) and a speed dropdown. Complete these options as per the
       instructions and choose Delete (other options include Privacy,
       Hide/Unhide, Unlike, and Backup).

   Note that the Year and Month fields include Select All options. This
   means you could effectively delete posts on a monthly or yearly basis
   or delete every post. However, to delete posts from a specific time
   period such as three months or three years, you will have to do this
   one month or one year at a time respectively.

   The Text Contains and Text Not Contains fields can be used as search
   filters to help the plugin decide what can stay or go. For example, you
   could choose to delete every post with the word “marketing” in it.
   And/or operators are allowed in these fields.

   The notes for the speed selector suggest that the plugin can be
   unreliable at times, and it advises you to choose a lower speed if a
   previous attempt wasn’t entirely successful.

   Disclaimers for this extension include the fact that deleted posts
   cannot be recovered, so downloading your Facebook data beforehand (see
   above) may be a wise move. Additionally, as alluded to in the speed
   notes, the extension might need to be run multiple times for all posts
   to be deleted.

Delete all Facebook Page posts

   Facebook Pages (typically used for businesses) work a lot differently
   than Facebook profiles. If you have a Facebook Page, it’s simple to
   delete multiple posts in one go, although bear in mind, you can still
   only delete 25 posts at a time with this method:
     * Go to your Page and click on Settings, then select Publishing
       Tools.

   Facebook settings. Facebook settings.
     * You should see a list of your published posts. Click the box to the
       left of Posts to select all.
     * Click on the Actions dropdown and select Delete.

   And that’s it. If you have more than 25 posts you want to delete, you
   can keep repeating the process until you’re done.

   If you want to delete bulk posts but are concerned you might need the
   information contained in them at a later date, you may want to consider
   downloading your Facebook data.

Other Facebook post options

   Aside from deleting posts, Facebook gives you other options such as
   allowing you to hide a post or limit who sees past posts. These can be
   helpful if there are specific posts you don’t want some people to see.

   To hide a post, go to the post, click the three dots in the upper right
   corner, and select Hide from timeline. The posts still exist and may
   appear elsewhere on Facebook, but will no longer show up on your
   timeline.

   Another option is to limit who can see your past posts. Go to Settings
   > Privacy and look for the Your Activity section which should be at the
   top. Here, there’s an option to “Limit the audience for posts you’ve
   shared with friends of friends or Public?” If you select Limit Past
   Posts, then any posts currently on your timeline will only be visible
   to people in your friends list.

   Facebook privacy settings. Facebook privacy settings.

   This is handy, for example, if you don’t want a snooping employer to
   see your posts, but you want to keep your profile public.

   Note that you can’t delete posts by others, although you can stop them
   appearing on your timeline, remove tags, or report a post as being
   inappropriate. You can also delete posts you made on someone else’s
   page.

How to delete all Twitter posts

   Similar to Facebook, Twitter’s built-in settings only allow you to
   delete posts on an individual basis. To do this:
     * Find the post (tweet) on your timeline.
     * Click the downward arrow in the upper right corner of the tweet.
     * Select Delete Tweet.

   There are a couple of options available for bulk deleting tweets:

   TweetDelete is an application that enables you to delete your 3,200
   most recent tweets, which is likely ample for most people. It also lets
   you set up automatic tweet deletion for specified timeframes. Since
   TweetDelete works in any web browser and you don’t have to download an
   app or extension, you can use it on your desktop, phone, or tablet.
   This application is free to use and simple to get started with:
     * Go to the TweetDelete homepage, read the terms and check the
       corresponding box, and click Sign in with Twitter.

   TweetDelete homepage. TweetDelete homepage.
     * You’ll be prompted to sign in to your account, and doing so will
       authorize the application to use your account.

   TweetDelete authorization. TweetDelete authorization.
     * You’ll then see a few options. The main option is the auto-delete
       feature. You can set it to automatically delete tweets of a certain
       age. The default is three months, but you can choose various
       timeframes, from one week to one year. You can also choose to
       delete all of your tweets by checking the box next to DELETE ALL MY
       TWEETS before activating this schedule.

   Activate TweetDelete page. Activate TweetDelete page.
     * Once you’ve made your selections, you can hit Activate TweetDelete.

   If you have more than 3,200 tweets to delete, you can repeat the
   process until you’re done. On the other hand, if you want to rid your
   account of all Tweets in one fell swoop and you have lots to deal with,
   then you might want to try TweetEraser. This app costs $6.99 and has
   the ability to delete all tweets in one go.

   These apps delete your posts permanently, so if you’d like to be able
   to retrieve any information after the fact, it may be wise to request
   your Twitter archive before deleting tweets. Also, note that one of
   TweetDelete’s disclaimers is that mass tweet deletion can “cause major
   bugs with your Twitter timeline that only Twitter support can fix.”
   Indeed, Twitter states that the reasons for various Twitter issues
   might include mass-deletion of Tweets.

   Note that some deleted tweets may still be visible via services like
   Wayback Machine and Google cache. For Wayback Machine, someone would
   have to have intentionally archived the page with the tweet. For Google
   cache, recent tweets by prominent users are more likely to be saved.

How to delete all Instagram posts

   Again, with its built-in settings, Instagram only allows you to delete
   individual posts manually. It’s even more restrictive, however, as you
   can’t delete posts from your web browser, only from the official iOS or
   Android app. Here’s how to delete your Instagram posts from the app:
     * Within the app, find the post in your Instagram account.
     * Click the three dots in the upper right corner of the post.
     * Select Delete.

   Note that you also have an Archive option, which will hide the post
   from view. Archiving is reversible whereas deleting is not.

   As with Facebook and Twitter, external applications can help rid you of
   multiple Instagram posts at once. Popular options include Cleaner for
   Ins (iOS) Cleaner for IG (iOS), and Cleaner for Instagram (Android).
   Note that according to user reviews and reports, these types of apps
   tend to work much better on iOS than Android, so if you have the
   option, try an iOS app first.

   These apps will let you perform a certain number of operations for free
   before asking you to upgrade to a paid account.

   For this post, we’ll show you how to use Cleaner for Ins:
     * Download the Cleaner for Ins app to your iOS device.
     * You’ll be prompted to log in (use your Instagram credentials).

   InstaClean app. InstaClean app.
     * Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
     * Select Post from the bottom menu and your posts will pop up.
     * Tap all those you want to delete and click Delete in the upper
       right corner.

   The free version of Cleaner for Ins gives you 40 operations when you
   first log in, but you can earn more by logging in daily, presumably so
   the app can serve you ads (there are lots of Facebook popup ads in this
   app). Alternatively, you can pay to upgrade. The cost is $1.39 for 80
   operations, $2.79 for 200 operations, and $3.99 for the Pro version.
   The lattermost option is a one-time payment that gives you unlimited
   operations and no ads.

   Aside from mass deleting posts, you can perform other operations
   including unfollowing others, blocking current followers, adding users
   to a whitelist, and removing likes.

   Again, it’s worth noting some of the disclaimers that come with this
   app. Even though the Pro version of the app enables you to delete as
   many posts as you want, Instagram sets their own limits, which still
   apply when using the cleaner app:
     * Instagram may temporarily suspend your account if you perform more
       than 50 operations in an hour.
     * It may also suspend your account if you perform more than 1,000
       operations in a day.

   The Pro version of the app might still be worth it, but bear in mind,
   it could be a long process if you have a lot of posts to delete.

Protect Against Posthumous ID Theft

   Paul BischoffTECH JOURNALIST, PRIVACY ADVOCATE AND VPN EXPERT
   @pabischoff June 4, 2019

   Protect Against Posthumous ID Theft Protect Against Posthumous ID Theft

   Reported cases of identity theft are increasing each year. In 2017, the
   Identity Theft Resource Center reported that nearly 179 million records
   were illegally released, a 44% increase of reported data breaches
   compared to 2016 figures.

   Millions of Americans are at risk of identity theft thanks to the wide
   availability of personal information online and breaches that make
   Social Security numbers available for bulk purchase on the black
   market. If you notice unauthorized activity on your personal accounts,
   there are steps you can take to prevent further losses. But what
   happens when an identity is stolen after a person has passed away?
   Often, no one notices due to the natural grieving process and the
   sometimes overwhelming responsibilities that come with settling a
   person’s estate.

   Unfortunately, posthumous identity theft is a real problem, affecting
   nearly 800 000 estates every year. It’s important to know how to
   protect the estate of your loved ones so their data is not exploited by
   criminals.

How Do Criminals Find the Information?

   Criminals are often well-organized and work diligently to identify
   potential targets for posthumous identity theft. Massive security
   breaches like the 2017 Equifax hack have released plenty of personal
   details to the black market.

   Databases of details such as full names, birthdates and addresses exist
   online for purchase. It’s possible that only small amounts of
   additional detail are required for identities to be stolen. People who
   have passed away make tempting targets as the theft can go unnoticed
   for a long time.

   The next section outlines how you can reduce the amount of personal
   information available in the public domain for criminals to scavenge.
   Prior to the invention of the internet, criminals were known to crawl
   through trash cans to steal documents with personal details listed.
   This is still a concern when grieving relatives are required to clean a
   deceased relative’s home, and any documents that need to be discarded
   should first be shredded or destroyed before disposal.

   With enough personal information in hand, thieves can use the
   deceased’s identity to open new accounts and lines of credit, take over
   existing accounts, and/or collect benefits in the victim’s name.

How to limit personal information in the public sphere

   Losing a loved one is very difficult, and often emotions can be
   overwhelming. Unfortunately, it’s critical that one family member is
   made responsible for managing the estate of the deceased family member.
   This may be the nominated executor of the estate. Here is a list of
   things that should be taken care of promptly. Some of these actions can
   only be undertaken after an official death certificate is secured, so
   make it a priority to have the paperwork completed. This is often
   conducted by the funeral director, but may be produced by a health
   service such as a hospital if the family member passed away in care.
     * Create a list of known bank accounts, credit cards, financial
       involvements and insurance policies. Get in contact with each
       provider and close or cancel the accounts,
     * Cancel the person’s driver’s licence, passport and any other
       identity-related licences or permits,
     * Send a copy of the death certificate to the IRS to notify them of
       the death to avoid tax fraud. Send the paperwork to the campus the
       person would normally file their taxes,
     * Contact the three credit bureaus (addresses are listed at the
       bottom of this list) and ask them to put a note on the file to say
       the person is deceased. This will happen on its own when the Social
       Security Administration add the deceased’s Social Security number
       to the ‘Death Master List’, but it can take up to six months. It’s
       better to act immediately,
     * If you have access to them, edit any social media accounts to
       remove personal information, or delete them. Some networks allow
       people to ‘memorialize’ the accounts so they cannot be altered but
       accessed by previous contacts.

   There are also physical things you can take care of.
     * Secure the person’s wallet as soon as you’re able. It’s not unheard
       of for identity documents to be stolen by unscrupulous support
       staff,
     * Host the wake in a location anywhere except the person’s home. Some
       thieves target wakes to steal valuable items and documents while
       the families are distracted,
     * Ask the post office to hold the mail if the person lived alone or
       in supervised care. This prevents sensitive information from
       sitting in an unsecured mailbox,
     * Restrict the information you include in any public obituaries. Omit
       details such as their maiden name, birthdate and full address so
       the public can’t use the information to their own ends,
     * As mentioned above, shred and destroy any documents that contain
       personal details and Social Security number. Do not throw them out
       without first making them unusable by thieves.

Credit bureau details

   You will need to contact each credit bureau individually to place a
   ‘deceased alert’ on their credit file. This should stop all lenders
   from issuing new loans in your loved one’s name. Use secured or
   registered mail to post a certified copy of the death certificate, and
   a letter including the person’s full name, any past names including
   previous married and maiden names, Social Security number, dates of
   birth and death, and last 5 years of addresses.

Canada

   Canadians can protect their loved one’s estate from posthumous identity
   theft by following the above-mentioned advice regarding securing their
   personal details. The Government of Canada provides a comprehensive
   website that lists the appropriate agencies to contact, including
   credit bureaus and the Canada Revenue Agency.

UK

   Along with taking the precautions outlined above, British people can
   use the government’s Tell Us Once service to notify multiple government
   departments of a death. This will cancel the person’s passport,
   driver’s licence and social benefits, and remove them from the
   electoral roll, along with notifying other relevant departments.
   Contact credit bureau Experian by phone 0344 481 8000 or online at
   www.experian.co.uk

Australia

   Australians should use the advice listed above to proactively protect
   against posthumous identity theft. The Australian government offers a
   comprehensive guide regarding who to contact, and includes options to
   notify the government of the death. This will secure the deceased
   person’s government details including Centrelink, child support and
   medicare. The Australian Tax Office will need to be notified
   separately.

   Credit bureaus will need to be contacted individually to have a ‘death
   note’ attached to the file.
