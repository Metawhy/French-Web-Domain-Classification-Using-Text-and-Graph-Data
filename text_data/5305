Evil Hides In The Woods
     __________________________________________________________________

   Inspired by the cinematic lore of Blair Witch, experience a new
   story-driven psychological horror game that studies your reactions to
   fear and stress.

   It’s 1996. A young boy disappears in the Black Hills Forest near
   Burkittsville, Maryland. As Ellis, a former police officer with a
   troubled past, you join the search. What starts as an ordinary
   investigation soon turns into an endless nightmare as you confront your
   fears and the Blair Witch, a mysterious force that haunts the woods...
     * A Story Of The Human Descent Into Darkness
       Experience an original story based on the legend of Blair Witch
       from the makers of Layers of Fear.
     * Find The Way Through The Haunted Woods
       Navigate your way through a cursed forest that warps and distorts
       both time and space.
     * Your Sanity Against Her Curse
       Stand against the horrors of the Blair Witch and the decaying
       sanity of a man burdened by his past.
     * How Will You Face Your Fears?
       How you react to danger and behave under pressure will ultimately
       teach you more about yourself.
