   our planet, exploiting vulnerable workers, invading our privacy and
   flouting our tax laws. Of course, that's a gross caricature. And almost
   all big brands are stacked full of people who do really care about
   doing the right thing. Nevertheless, we've been talking for years about
   a more sustainable, more socially responsible consumerism, and it often
   doesn't feel we're much closer to the epic trajectory shift that's
   needed. The system is stuck.

   So here's a radical idea. What if megabrands stopped being the problem
   and proved they could be the answer? What if they started to seek 'big
   brand redemption'?

   Think about it: the world's biggest brands have resources, human
   capital and international reach that pretty much no other organisations
   - not even many national governments - can match. The Coca-Cola Company
   and its bottling partners, for example, employ 700,000 people in more
   than 200 countries. They could change the world for the better in
   amazing ways.

   So what does big brand redemption look like in practice? Broadly, it
   means big brands using their unique capabilities - expertise,
   infrastructure, reach and more - to do the things no one else can. Take
   that Coca-Cola example: in 2013 British social entrepreneur Simon Berry
   had the idea of distributing medicine in rural Africa by piggybacking
   on Coca-Cola's distribution network across the continent. His design
   for a packet of medicine that fitted into the gaps in a crate full of
   Coke bottles won the Design Museum's Product of the Year Award, and
   thousands of packets of medicine were transported.

   Or take Unilever, which via hand-washing campaigns has helped more than
   300 million in developing countries avoid the scourge of potentially
   fatal diarrhoea. CEO Paul Polman says the goal is to reach a billion
   people. That is what big brand redemption looks like: it means using a
   brand's unique and vast capabilities for good.

   So why can't every megabrand get going? Why did Coke have to wait for
   someone like Simon Berry to come up with the medicine idea? Yes, I can
   hear you screaming the answer. Money. Because doing good costs money.
   And megabrands are under immense pressure to be profitable.

   But here's the thing: for megabrands, seeking big brand redemption is
   just enlightened self-interest. Rising numbers of people feel
   increasingly guilty about the negative impacts of their consumption,
   and they're on the lookout for brands that will assuage that guilt.
   Meanwhile, a host of shiny startups - think newcomers such as shoe
   brand TOMS, with its buy-one-give-one model - are busy proving that
   there can be a more ethical, responsible consumerism. Now we've arrived
   at a paradox where many consumers love new and pretty much unknown
   brands over those they've known their whole lives.

   That's not a great place for big brands to be. And in the end it will
   prove their undoing. Time, then, for them to seek redemption. If they
   can't do it for all our sakes, let them do it for their own.

Household name megabrands - both new and old - have a problem. For rising
numbers of people, the phrase big brand conjures up a dystopian vision of a
monolithic organisation raking in billions while polluting our planet,
exploiting vulnerable workers, invading our privacy and flouting our tax

Big brands giving back

by David Mattin

   Household name megabrands - both new and old - have a problem. For
   rising numbers of people, the phrase big brand conjures up a dystopian
   vision of a monolithic organisation raking in billions while polluting
   our planet, exploiting vulnerable workers, invading our privacy and
   flouting our tax laws. Of course, that's a gross caricature. And almost
   all big brands are stacked full of people who do really care about
   doing the right thing. Nevertheless, we've been talking for years about
   a more sustainable, more socially responsible consumerism, and it often
   doesn't feel we're much closer to the epic trajectory shift that's
   needed. The system is stuck.

   So here's a radical idea. What if megabrands stopped being the problem
   and proved they could be the answer? What if they started to seek 'big
   brand redemption'?

   Think about it: the world's biggest brands have resources, human
   capital and international reach that pretty much no other organisations
   - not even many national governments - can match. The Coca-Cola Company
   and its bottling partners, for example, employ 700,000 people in more
   than 200 countries. They could change the world for the better in
   amazing ways.

   So what does big brand redemption look like in practice? Broadly, it
   means big brands using their unique capabilities - expertise,
   infrastructure, reach and more - to do the things no one else can. Take
   that Coca-Cola example: in 2013 British social entrepreneur Simon Berry
   had the idea of distributing medicine in rural Africa by piggybacking
   on Coca-Cola's distribution network across the continent. His design
   for a packet of medicine that fitted into the gaps in a crate full of
   Coke bottles won the Design Museum's Product of the Year Award, and
   thousands of packets of medicine were transported.

   Or take Unilever, which via hand-washing campaigns has helped more than
   300 million in developing countries avoid the scourge of potentially
   fatal diarrhoea. CEO Paul Polman says the goal is to reach a billion
   people. That is what big brand redemption looks like: it means using a
   brand's unique and vast capabilities for good.

   So why can't every megabrand get going? Why did Coke have to wait for
   someone like Simon Berry to come up with the medicine idea? Yes, I can
   hear you screaming the answer. Money. Because doing good costs money.
   And megabrands are under immense pressure to be profitable.

   But here's the thing: for megabrands, seeking big brand redemption is
   just enlightened self-interest. Rising numbers of people feel
   increasingly guilty about the negative impacts of their consumption,
   and they're on the lookout for brands that will assuage that guilt.
   Meanwhile, a host of shiny startups - think newcomers such as shoe
   brand TOMS, with its buy-one-give-one model - are busy proving that
   there can be a more ethical, responsible consumerism. Now we've arrived
   at a paradox where many consumers love new and pretty much unknown
   brands over those they've known their whole lives.

   That's not a great place for big brands to be. And in the end it will
   prove their undoing. Time, then, for them to seek redemption. If they
   can't do it for all our sakes, let them do it for their own.
