AerServ Privacy Practices and Cookie Policy

   Introduction: This page is divided into five (5) Parts. Part A provides
   for AerServ’s Privacy Policy related to its Platform Services; Part B
   provides for terms which are specific to EEA users; Part C provides for
   AerServ’s Cookie Policy; Part D provides for AerServ’s Privacy Policy
   related to use of its website; and Part E provides for the General
   Terms applicable overall. Please refer and read carefully the Part that
   is applicable or relevant to you. “EEA” means all member states of the
   European Union and for the purpose of this document, U.K. and
   Switzerland.

   Part A:

   AerServ Platform Services Privacy Policy

   Aerserv LLC (“AerServ” or “we” or “us” or “our”) provides advertising
   technology services and/or platform (“Platform Services”) that allow
   publishers of mobile applications (“Apps”) and websites to show ads on
   their sites and apps, and advertisers to reach audiences that may be
   interested in their products or services.

   AerServ is committed to respecting and protecting individuals’ privacy
   rights. This Part explains how AerServ collects and uses information
   about end-users who view or interact with ads facilitated by AerServ on
   third party websites or mobile Apps.

   If you are a customer/partner/vendor/user/recipient of InMobi’s
   services, kindly see InMobi’s Privacy Policy set out in:
   https://www.inmobi.com/privacy-policy/.

   Information we collect: When you interact with a website or App that
   uses the Services, we may collect information about your device and the
   ads you view or click, including but not limited to: (a) information
   about your device, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating
   system, carrier name, Internet Protocol (IP) address, mobile browser,
   applications using the Services and the version of such applications,
   and identifiers assigned to your device; (b) log information, including
   the app or website visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and
   network connection type, and cookie information; (c) geo-location of
   your device, when location services have been enabled; (d) information
   about ads served, viewed, or clicked on; and (e) information of AerServ
   customers/partners/publishers have collected and share with AerServ
   about your activity in their sites and Apps. We receive information
   about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on
   the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and
   use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of
   the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed
   by Aerserv or its policies.

   How we use this information: We use the information we collect to
   provide and improve the Services, including but not limited to the
   following purposes: (a) serving ads, (b) ad reporting (ads shown and
   ads clicked), (c) frequency capping: Preventing users from seeing the
   same ad too many times, (d) fraud detection and prevention, (e)
   interest-based advertising, (f) geo-targeting of ads, (g) providing and
   improving the Services.

   Ads may be customised to the users’ interests and geographic locations,
   which we may derive or infer from information that we collect about how
   those users interact with such sites and apps (this type of advertising
   is often called “interest-based advertising” or “targeted
   advertising”). This enables our partners/customers to provide
   content-rich services that are more relevant to their users. Further,
   we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or
   advertisers’ partners for optimising digital advertising and/or
   analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and
   reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is
   governed by the privacy policy of such third party partners and/or
   advertisers providing the same.

   AerServ may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the
   process of collecting data from devices that have been determined
   through statistical analysis to be linked or related. We, or third
   parties whom we engage to provide this service, may use cross-device
   data to provide interest-based advertising services and to deliver
   tailored ads to users across multiple devices.

   Information we collect: When you interact with a website or App that
   uses the Services, we may collect information about your device and the
   ads you view or click, including but not limited to: (a) information
   about your device, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating
   system, carrier name, Internet Protocol (IP) address, mobile browser,
   applications using the Services and the version of such applications,
   and identifiers assigned to your device; (b) log information, including
   the app or website visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and
   network connection type, and cookie information; (c) geo-location of
   your device, when location services have been enabled; (d) information
   about ads served, viewed, or clicked on; and (e) information of AerServ
   Customers have collected and share with AerServ about your activity in
   their sites and Apps. We receive information about consumers from third
   parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and
   application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is
   governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector
   and the website using the data; it is not governed by Aerserv or its
   policies. AerServ may also collect some or all of the following
   information about an ad presented on your device: (i) the content type
   of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, news); (ii) the ad type
   (e.g. whether the ad is a text, image, or video based ad); (iii) where
   the ad is being served ; (iv) whether the ad has been clicked or
   viewed; (v) whether a conversion was generated from the ad; (vi)
   advertiser bid and purchase pricing for the ad.

   How we use this information: We use the information we collect to
   provide and improve the Services, including but not limited to the
   following purposes: (a) serving ads, (b) ad reporting (ads shown and
   ads clicked), (c) frequency capping: Preventing users from seeing the
   same ad too many times, (d) fraud detection and prevention, (e)
   interest-based advertising, (f) geo-targeting of ads, (g) providing and
   improving the Services.

   Ads may be customised to the users’ interests and geographic locations,
   which we may derive or infer from information that we collect about how
   those users interact with such sites and apps (this type of advertising
   is often called “interest-based advertising” or “targeted
   advertising”). This enables our partners/customers to provide
   content-rich services that are more relevant to their users. Further,
   we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or
   advertisers’ partners for optimising digital advertising and/or
   analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and
   reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is
   governed by the privacy policy of such third party partners and/or
   advertisers providing the same. AerServ may collect the geo-location of
   your device only when an App or site, which leverages Services is
   active on the device. AerServ may infer the geo location of a device
   based on data collected through a WiFi identifier that the device is
   connected to, subject to country specific laws and/or industry
   guidelines related to such collection or inference practices. e.g: In
   the U.S. AerServ may infer geo-location through WiFi identifiers
   pursuant to obtaining user consent through applicable apps or sites.

   AerServ may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the
   process of collecting data from devices that have been determined
   through statistical analysis to be linked or related. We, or third
   parties whom we engage to provide this service, may use cross-device
   data to provide interest-based advertising services and to deliver
   tailored ads to users across multiple devices.

   Who we share this information with: We share with advertiser customers
   information so that they can decide whether to bid on ad inventory or
   serve an advertisement and choose the best ad for that device.

   We may share the information with our publishers, developers, data
   partners, measurement companies and advertisers. These partners may use
   this information to show you relevant ads, measure your ad/site
   interaction, identify your interest areas, better understand the site
   and app traffic usage or user behaviour in order to refine and improve
   their services. Such partners’ use of the information we share with
   them will be governed by their privacy policies.

   We may share this information with our parent or affiliates in relation
   to advertising services, or with third parties such as advisors and law
   enforcement authorities where it is necessary to comply with the law or
   regulations, enforce or apply our user terms and conditions, protect
   our rights, or preserve the safety of our users. This may include
   exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
   protection.

   AerServ may also share your information in connection with any merger,
   a sale of AerServ’s assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a
   portion of our business to another company.

   Part B:

   Terms applicable to EEA users:

   This Part explains how AerServ collects, uses, secures, and/or
   discloses EEA end users’ (“you” or “your”) device-related information
   when (i) you view or interact with ads facilitated by AerServ on third
   party websites or mobile apps and (ii) you visit the AerServ website at
   https://www.aerserv.com.

   The provisions of this Part must be read with the terms of Part A, Part
   C and Part D as applicable and are supplementary to the same, except
   when there is a conflict, in which case, for EEA users the terms of
   this Part shall prevail.

   How do we use personal data of EEA data subjects:

   To target advertising to your preferences: AerServ uses the information
   that we collect from your device to display advertising on your device,
   which may include interest-based advertising customised to individuals’
   inferred interests, preferences and locations and to perform analysis
   aimed at improving our services. Please see Part A for the details in
   this regard. The information we collect from your device also helps us
   to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage
   ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide
   targeting options for advertisers. We rely on your consent to process
   your data in this way. If you do not consent, the ads you see will be
   less tailored to your interests. In particular, processing your data in
   this way help our publishers and developer clients, for example, to
   avoid presenting you ads that you have already seen, and helps our
   advertiser clients serve advertisements that are more likely to be of
   interest to you.

   For account management purposes: We use the account information and
   other personal information you provide to manage your account,
   communicate with you, conduct business with you (e.g. reporting and
   payment), personalise the AerServ  website and comply with your
   requests.

   To contact you with marketing information: We will handle your personal
   information (such as your name, email address, postal address,
   telephone number and sector preferences) to provide you with marketing
   and inform you about products and services in accordance with your
   marketing preferences.

   When we send you marketing emails because you have opted-in to receive
   them, we rely on your consent to contact you for marketing purposes.

   If you have not opted-in and we send you marketing emails, we do this
   because of our legitimate interest to promote the success of AerServ.
   Every email we send to you for marketing purposes will also contain
   instructions on how to unsubscribe from receiving them.

   You are not under any obligation to provide us with your personal data
   for marketing purposes.

   You can tell AerServ that you do not want your personal
   information/data to be processed in this way at any time by contacting
   us at privacy@inmobi.com or, where relevant, by following the
   unsubscribe link shown in every marketing communication you receive
   from us.

   To conduct web analytics: We use your usage information to analyse our
   web traffic, to figure out how often customers use parts of the site,
   to improve the site and generally to make it appealing to as many users
   as possible.

   International transfer of EEA user’s personal data: Whenever AerServ
   transfers your personal information/data outside of the EEA, we ensure
   it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards
   is in place:
     *
          + by transferring your personal information to a country that
            has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by
            the European Commission;

     *
          + by using specific contracts approved by the European
            Commission which give your personal information the same
            protection it has within the EEA including to U.S.;

     * where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
       them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
       provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe
       and the US.

   If you wish to learn more about the specific circumstances when each of
   these protection measures are used, you can contact us at
   privacy@inmobi.com for the details as to how we protect specific
   transfer of your data.

   All information you provide to AerServ is stored on our secure servers
   or those of our third party data storage providers. Where we have given
   you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
   certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this
   password confidential. You must not share your password with anyone.

   Your rights:

   Right of access: Where we do hold limited personal information about
   you (such as personal information about an AerServ account you have
   with us), you can ask us for access to this personal information, to
   correct or update any inaccurate personal information we hold, to stop
   sending you direct marketing or to stop using your personal information
   altogether.

   Right to rectification: You have the right to require AerServ to
   rectify any inaccurate personal information we hold about you. You also
   have the right to have incomplete personal information we hold about
   you completed, by providing a supplementary statement to us.

   Right to restriction: You can restrict AerServ’s processing of your
   personal information where:
     *
          + you think we hold inaccurate personal information about you;

     *
          + our handling of your personal information breaks the law, but
            you do not want us to delete it;

     *
          + AerServ no longer needs to process your personal information,
            but you want us to keep it for legal reasons; or

     * where we are handling your personal information because we have a
       legitimate interest, as described above, and are in the process of
       objecting to this use of your personal information.

   Where you exercise your right to restrict AerServ from using your
   personal information, we will then only process your personal
   information when you agree, except for storage purposes and to handle
   legal claims.

   Right to data portability: You have the right to receive your personal
   information in a structured, standard machine readable format and to
   send this to another organisation controlling your personal
   information.  This right only applies to your personal information we
   are handling because you consented to us using it or because there is a
   contract in place between us.

   Right to erasure: You have the right to require AerServ to erase your
   personal information which we are handling in the following
   circumstances:
     *
          + where we no longer need to use your personal information for
            the reasons we told you we collected it for;

     *
          + where we needed your consent to use your personal information,
            you have withdrawn your consent and there is no other lawful
            way we can continue to use your personal information;

     *
          + when you object to our use of your personal information and we
            have no compelling reason to carry on handling it;

     *
          + if our handling of your personal information has broken the
            law; and

     * when we must erase your personal information to comply with a law
       we are subject to.

   Right to complain: You have the right to lodge a complaint with the
   Information Commissioner’s Office, the supervisory authority for data
   protection issues in England and Wales.

   If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may be able to
   make the update within your account settings or by contacting us using
   the details provided below.

   Part C: Cookie Policy

   This Policy sets out the different scenarios in which AerServ may use
   cookies and web beacons to automatically collect certain data about (a)
   end-users of Applications and/or websites who use the Services; (b)
   publisher and advertiser customers that use the Platform Services and
   (c) visitors to AerServ’s website.

   Cookies are small text files typically containing a sequence of numbers
   and letters that websites and/or applications serve to your browser.
   Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your device’s hard
   drive when you visit the website. Flash cookies are similar to browser
   cookies except that they can store more data and are stored in your
   browser rather than on your hard drive.  You can have your browser
   and/or plug-ins to your browser notify you of, or automatically reject,
   cookies. If you reject our cookies, you may still use the website, but
   you may be limited in the use of some of its features. In the event
   that you reject our cookies, temporary or “session” cookies will be
   used to help you shop and will expire when the browser is closed.
   Cookies are often used to provide a personalized experience to
   visitors/users as well as to provide reporting information regarding
   user’s activity or how users are engaging with the websites and
   applications.

   Web beacons (also called clear gifs and pixel tags), tracking links
   and/or similar technology consist of a few lines of code that are
   embedded on the pages of the website. They are often used in
   combination with cookies and are often not visible to the user of the
   website. Web beacons may relay information to third parties such as our
   service providers and may be used in order to track customer response
   to certain advertising, to better target interactive advertising and to
   enhance customer support and usability. If you reject our cookies (see
   “Cookies” section below), you will prevent Web beacons from relaying
   this information about you and may limit your use of some of the
   website’s features.

   Scenario 1 –

   When you visit AerServ website, we use cookies and web beacons to
   automatically collect certain information about your visit to the
   website and interaction with the same.

   We use cookies to generally enable our systems to recognize users to
   help our systems identify how and when pages within the AerServ website
   are visited and by how many people. We use cookies and web beacons to
   improve the website, monitor and analyze web traffic. This enables us
   to understand which parts of our website are of greatest interest to
   our visitors, as well as to understand certain aggregated geographic
   and demographic information about our visitors. We use this information
   to continuously improve our website offering for the benefit of our
   visitors.

   By using the AerServ website, you consent to the use of these cookies.
   If you do not like the idea of cookies or certain types of
   cookies/beacons, you can change your browser’s settings to delete
   cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies. To
   learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser.
   Please however note, that, if you delete cookies or do not accept them,
   you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not
   be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not
   display properly.

   Scenario 2 –

   As a provider of Platform Services, AerServ may partner with publishers
   to distribute advertisements. The following provision read with Part A
   provides the details in this regard.

   We use cookies for analyzing usage and for tracking the advertisement
   serving process. The cookies we serve enable us to collect information
   about how users interact with our partners’ websites so that we can
   better customize the advertisements we serve and avoid serving
   advertisements that the user has already seen or is not interested in.

   We also use cookies to collect certain reporting information about the
   ads we serve, such as the type of device on which they were viewed, the
   geographies where they were viewed, the format of the ad displayed
   (such as text or image format) and so on. Note that, web beacons may
   relay information to third parties such as our service providers and
   may be used in order to track customer response to certain advertising,
   to better target interactive advertising and to enhance customer
   support and usability.

   This may include events related to your activity on our partner’s Apps,
   mobile website or events related to the AerServ Platform Services.
   Cookies or pixels enable us to keep a record of the publisher site you
   were using when you were shown an advertisement facilitated by AerServ
   or interacted with such an advertisement, analyze trends, and
   understand users’ interests in respect of such mobile websites. We
   would like to assure you that we do not know your identity, your name,
   your address, date of birth, social security number, credit
   card/financial information, email address or phone number.

   Our partners may also place cookies on the websites you visit. Their
   use is governed by the specific privacy policies of such partners which
   can be accessed directly from their mobile websites.

   Information Sharing and Disclosure

   We may disclose information about AerServ customers or partners when
   necessary to provide the Platform Services to them.

   modes of providing the data sets referred above, we advise all visitors

   We use various technologies to collect information about your visit to
   our website to enhance and customize your experience. For example, we
   may collect the numerical IP address identifying your computer or

   traffic, to figure out how often customers use parts of the site, to

   about AerServ customers/partners/vendors when necessary to provide the
   Platform Services to them. We will share personal information only in
   the ways that are described in this document. We do not sell any such
   personal information to third parties. From time to time, we may need
   to disclose such information to third parties such as to law
   enforcement authorities or our legal advisers, where it is necessary to
   comply with the law or regulation; enforce or apply our user terms and
   conditions; to protect our rights, or to preserve the safety of our
   users. This may include exchanging information with other companies and
   organizations for fraud protection.

   We may also share personal information with companies that provide
   services to help us with our business activities (e.g. processing
   payments or submitting emails on our behalf), in connection with any
   merger, a sale of AerServ assets, or a financing or acquisition of all
   or a portion of our business to another company. We need to process
   personal information in this way to provide the ongoing services and
   benefits. Whenever we share personal information for this reason we
   will ensure that the recipient is bound by all appropriate
   confidentiality obligations and that it commits to using such personal
   information only for the purposes for which it is originally provided.
