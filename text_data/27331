Abstract

   Evidence for locomotion in the Precambrian fossil record is scant.
   Reliable Ediacaran trace fossils are all younger than 560 Ma, and
   consist of relatively simple horizontal burrows and trails from
   shallow-water deposits. Here we describe an assemblage of macroscopic
   locomotory traces from deep-water environments at Mistaken Point,
   southeastern Newfoundland, Canada, dated to ca. 565 Ma. These trails
   extend the record of complex trace fossils back into the earliest
   Avalonian biota. Our new evidence for large motile organisms on the
   seafloor at this time suggests that at least some of these early
   Ediacaran organisms, whose biological affinities are widely debated,
   could have been muscular and of metazoan grade.

Abstract

   Recent ocean-bottom geophysical surveys, dredging, and dives, which
   complement surface data and scientific drilling at the Island of
   Hawaii, document that evolutionary stages during volcano growth are
   more diverse than previously described. Based on combining available
   composition, isotopic age, and geologically constrained volume data for
   each of the component volcanoes, this overview provides the first
   integrated models for overall growth of any Hawaiian island. In
   contrast to prior morphologic models for volcano evolution (preshield,
   shield, postshield), growth increasingly can be tracked by age and
   volume (magma supply), defining waxing alkalic, sustained tholeiitic,
   and waning alkalic stages. Data and estimates for individual volcanoes
   are used to model changing magma supply during successive compositional
   stages, to place limits on volcano life spans, and to interpret
   composite assembly of the island. Volcano volumes vary by an order of
   magnitude; peak magma supply also varies sizably among edifices but is
   challenging to quantify because of uncertainty about volcano life
   spans. Three alternative models are compared: (1) near-constant volcano
   propagation, (2) near-equal volcano durations, (3) high peak-tholeiite
   magma supply. These models define inconsistencies with prior geodynamic
   models, indicate that composite growth at Hawaii peaked ca. 800–400 ka,
   and demonstrate a lower current rate. Recent age determinations for
   Kilauea and Kohala define a volcano propagation rate of 8.6 cm/yr that
   yields plausible inception ages for other volcanoes of the Kea trend.
   In contrast, a similar propagation rate for the less-constrained Loa
   trend would require inception of Loihi Seamount in the future and ages
   that become implausibly large for the older volcanoes. An alternative
   rate of 10.6 cm/yr for Loa-trend volcanoes is reasonably consistent
   with ages and volcano spacing, but younger Loa volcanoes are offset
   from the Kea trend in age-distance plots. Variable magma flux at the
   Island of Hawaii, and longer-term growth of the Hawaiian chain as
   discrete islands rather than a continuous ridge, may record pulsed
   magma flow in the hotspot/plume source.

INTRODUCTION

   This overview, inspired by the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) in 2012, focuses on
   results of underwater studies of Hawaiian volcanoes that provide new
   perspectives on the growth of intraplate volcanoes. Recent studies have
   been especially productive for the Island of Hawaii (Fig. 1), where
   sonar surveys, dives, and dredging by the University of Hawaii,
   Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and USGS, and collaborations with
   the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) have
   complemented on-land scientific drilling and abundant data from HVO.

   These results, in combination with a vast body of older data, provide
   new insights about volcano growth on Hawaii. More prior studies than
   can be acknowledged have evaluated growth of Hawaii in relation to
   longer-term evolution of the Hawaiian Ridge. Notable were early
   recognition of the southeastward younging of volcanoes and distinction
   of the parallel Kea and Loa volcanic trends (Dana, 1849; Jackson et
   al., 1972), and of course the insights about ocean-island volcanism
   that emerged in the 1960s from the plate-tectonic paradigm. Among
   recent critical observations and interpretations are: quantifying
   propagation rates along the Hawaiian-Emperor Ridge by isotopic dating
   (McDougall and Swanson, 1972; Jackson et al., 1972; Clague and
   Dalrymple, 1987), volume estimates from submarine bathymetry (Bargar
   and Jackson, 1974; Robinson and Eakins, 2006), recognition of an
   early-alkalic (“preshield”) stage at Loihi Seamount (Moore et al.,
   1982; Garcia et al., 1995a), insights into volcano growth based on ages
   of submerged slope breaks and coral reefs (Moore and Campbell, 1987;
   Ludwig et al., 1991), and geodynamic models for growth rates and
   compositional evolution in response to plate motion over a hotspot
   (Moore and Clague, 1992; DePaolo and Stolper, 1996; Ribe and
   Christensen, 1999; DePaolo et al., 2001).

   Until recently, compositions and ages bearing on growth of Hawaiian
   volcanoes have largely come from subaerial sampling of late eruptive
   stages, and estimates of inception and early evolution have been
   heavily model dependent, using volcano spacing and plate motion to
   infer propagation rates and duration of edifice growth. The present
   interpretive synthesis, by combining recent chemical and ^40Ar/^39Ar
   isotopic-age data (mainly from underwater and drill-hole samples),
   revised edifice volumes, limitations from volcano structures and
   eruptive processes, and geodynamic constraints, attempts to interpret
   the growth histories of individual volcanoes and the composite growth
   of the entire island. While focused on construction of Hawaii Island,
   some data from older islands are referenced briefly where helpful to
   constrain volcano-growth models. In part, this analysis is a sequel to
   the impressive synthesis by Moore and Clague (1992), while benefiting
   from compilations for the geologic map of Hawaii Island (Wolfe and
   Morris, 1996a, 1996b) and the state map of Hawaii (Sherrod et al.,
   2007). Particularly useful samples, compositional data, and imaging of
   deep structure have come from the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project
   (HSDP; Stolper et al., 1996, 2009) and ∼100 submersible dives and
   bathymetric surveys during JAMSTEC cruises in 1998–2002 (Takahashi et
   al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2003; Coombs et al., 2006a).

   Reliable age determinations for old Hawaiian lavas remain sparse, but
   recent application of ^40Ar/^39Ar methods to young basalts, especially
   underwater and subsurface samples, has improved controls on volcano
   growth (Table 1). Alkalic lavas have yielded stratigraphically coherent
   results for Mauna Kea and Kilauea (Sharp and Renne, 2005; Calvert and
   Lanphere, 2006), but dating of low-K tholeiites continues to be
   problematic because of low radiogenic-argon yields. In such tholeiites,
   K resides mainly in glassy selvages next to groundmass minerals,
   leaving samples vulnerable to argon loss and/or argon-recoil problems
   in the reactor. Some tholeiite samples fail to yield meaningful ages
   without apparent petrographic or chemical reasons. In the most detailed
   ^40Ar/^39Ar study to date of Hawaiian tholeiites, on the 1.5 km scarp
   along the submarine southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa, only 14 of 45
   analyzed samples yielded “successful ages” (Jicha et al., 2012). Less
   precise K-Ar determinations remain the main data for subaerial lavas on
   Kohala and Mauna Kea, and attempts to improve resolution by unspiked
   K-Ar methods for Kilauea and Loihi basalts (Guillou et al., 1997a,
   1997b) yielded some results that are internally contradictory or
   inconsistent with ^40Ar/^39Ar dates (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006).
   Appendix A lists the published ^40Ar/^39Ar and some recent K-Ar age
   determinations used for estimating volcano growth rates for the Island
   of Hawaii and underwater slopes.

   Volumes of individual volcanoes are also difficult to estimate, with
   probable uncertainties of 10%–20%, but constrained by the composite
   island construct (213,000 km^3; Robinson and Eakins, 2006). Deep
   subsidence along the Hawaiian Ridge, defined by seismic profiling (Hill
   and Zucca, 1987), requires volumes nearly twice early estimates that
   assumed growth on flat ocean floor (Bargar and Jackson, 1974). The
   prior estimates used vertical contacts between volcanoes; here, edifice
   volumes are adjusted for sloping and interfingering boundaries (Table
   2; Fig. 2; and discussion below). Effects of old seamounts and other
   irregularities of the ocean floor are neglected, as in prior estimates,
   but are unlikely to increase significantly uncertainties about total
   volume of the island construct. Positive gravity anomalies at volcano
   summits and proximal rift zones (Kinoshita et al., 1963; Kauahikaua et
   al., 2000), interpreted as recording dense intrusions and olivine
   cumulates, also help locate volcano boundaries where concealed by
   younger deposits. Each edifice is divided into subsections for which
   volumes can be calculated from simplified models, as done previously
   for Kilauea (Lipman et al., 2006). Further constraints come from
   eruption and lava-accumulation rates, especially for younger volcanoes.
   For volcanoes that onlap older edifices, an additional adjustment is
   made for the volume of deep intrusions and olivine cumulates. Details
   of volume calculations are tabulated in Appendix B.

   The age, composition, structural, and volume data for individual
   volcanoes can then be used to model changing magma supply during
   sequential compositional stages, to place limits on the duration of
   volcano growth, and to evaluate the composite assembly of the island
   (Table 3). These data show that the growth stages of Hawaiian volcanoes
   are more diverse than previously documented, define inconsistencies at
   various scales with geodynamic models, and indicate that composite
   volcanic growth at Hawaii peaked ca. 800–400 ka.

MORPHOLOGIC AND COMPOSITIONAL GROWTH STAGES

   Building on pioneering insights by Stearns (1946), Hawaiian volcanoes
   have commonly been discussed in terms of preshield, shield, postshield,
   and rejuvenated stages (e.g., Clague and Dalrymple, 1987; Peterson and
   Moore, 1987; Clague and Sherrod, in press). These terms have been used,
   somewhat ambiguously, concurrently to reference both morphology and
   composition. As chemical and age data become more abundant, especially
   for underwater samples that record early growth, tracking volcanic
   evolution primarily by composition and time seems increasingly
   desirable. Much more is known about later stages than earlier ones,
   although reliable age and eruption-rate data remain sparse. Modeling of
   growth commonly has assumed uniformly changing compositions and magma
   supply as the Pacific plate moves across a hotspot source, but recent
   data document considerable variation in stage durations, transitions
   between stages, periods of quiescence, and interactions between
   concurrently active edifices.

   This paper distinguishes three main compositional stages: waxing early
   alkalic, sustained main tholeiite, and waning late alkalic, versus
   morphologic evolution of the edifice (submarine, subaerial shield, late
   submergence). No volcano on Hawaii Island contains highly alkalic late
   volcanism considered characteristic of the rejuvenated stage, and the
   age significance of this stage at older Hawaiian volcanoes currently
   seems uncertain. Rocks assigned to this stage at volcanoes like East
   Maui (Haleakala) form an age continuum with prior waning-alkalic
   eruptions, while similar late-erupted rocks are separated from
   waning-alkalic lavas by long intervals at West Maui or are absent at
   volcanoes such as Lanai (Sherrod et al., 2007; Clague and Sherrod, in
   press).

   All Hawaiian volcanoes are broadly shield shaped in morphology
   regardless of composition, with sustained slopes rarely >15° both
   underwater and on land, except along fault and landslide scarps. Slopes
   are steeper underwater (Mark and Moore, 1987), in part because much
   shoreline-generated hyaloclastite breccia accumulates at angle of
   repose, in part because of steep slope-failure scarps at heads of
   submarine landslides.

   The most pronounced change in topographic profile, from steeper
   submarine slopes to more gentle subaerial deposition as a seamount
   becomes an island (Mark and Moore, 1987), typically occurs during
   eruption of relatively uniform tholeiite that constitutes >90% of
   volcano volume. Although subaerial slopes are generally low during the
   tholeiitic stage (commonly <5°), much variation is present as a
   function of eruptive style. Sustained tube-fed pahoehoe sheet flows
   that grow by inflation have dips of only a few degrees (Hon et al.,
   1994), while slopes reach 10° or steeper where built by small tholeiite
   eruptions as on upper slopes of Mauna Loa (above ∼3000 m; Mark and
   Moore, 1987, their figure 3.2).

   Independently of morphology and whether on land or underwater, edifice
   growth can be tracked by composition and magma supply. Tholeiitic lavas
   typically define coherent major-element arrays varying mainly in
   olivine content, as well documented for Kilauea and Mauna Loa (Wright,
   1971; Clague et al., 1995; Sisson et al., 2002). Early- and
   late-alkalic lavas are more variable. Compositions that plot between
   the dominant tholeiite array and the alkali-basalt boundary of
   MacDonald and Katsura (1964) have commonly been designated transitional
   basalt (Wolfe and Morris, 1996a, 1996b; Sisson et al., 2002; Coombs et
   al., 2006b), a usage continued here (see Fig. 4). Such transitional
   basalts, which are abundant during shifts between compositional stages
   at some volcanoes, have also been described as low-silica tholeiite,
   especially in HSDP studies (e.g., Stolper et al., 2004; Rhodes et al.,
   2012). Even more subtle compositional variations among tholeiites at
   individual volcanoes, over varied time scales, are documented by
   trace-element and isotopic studies (Frey and Rhodes, 1993; Kurz et al.,
   1995; Pietruszka and Garcia, 1999; Marske et al., 2007; Weis et al.,
   2011).

   The change from sustained-tholeiite (“shield”) to waning-alkalic
   eruptions (“postshield”) typically coincides with declining eruption
   rates, accompanied by submergence of the shoreline as volcano loading
   outpaces lava accumulation (Moore and Clague, 1992). Late-alkalic lavas
   also form steeper slopes than during the sustained tholeiite stage (up
   to 20°; Mark and Moore, 1987), a change probably resulting from smaller
   and briefer eruptions of alkalic basalt and more silicic lavas
   (hawaiite, mugearite) that form thicker and more viscous flows. Both
   compositional and morphologic changes have been widely referenced as
   the shield-postshield transition. However, capacity of a volcano to
   sustain subaerial growth is a function of volcano size in relation to
   magma supply. At a large volcano such as Mauna Loa, subsidence can
   outpace coastal lava accumulation late during the tholeiitic stage
   (Lipman, 1995; Lipman and Moore, 1996). In contrast, Mauna Kea
   continued subaerial growth well after the change to late alkalic
   volcanism (ca. 330 ka; Sharp and Renne, 2005), with submergence
   beginning to outpace growth only at ca. 130 ka (Moore and Clague,
   1992).

   As a result of such competing processes, the dueling balance between
   growth and subsidence at the shoreline can terminate at different
   stages of compositional evolution. Accordingly, the record of
   slope-break (shoreline) submergence (Moore and Campbell, 1987; Moore
   and Clague, 1992) provides critical evidence for declining eruption
   rates, but does not necessarily coincide with the shift from
   main-tholeiite to late-alkalic stage. Additional factors modulating
   volcano growth include changes in eruption sites and duration: distal
   segments of rift zones can shut down as volcano size increases (e.g.,
   Mauna Loa southwest rift zone [Moore et al., 1990b], Hilo Ridge of
   Kohala [Lipman and Calvert, 2011]), eruptions become focused higher on
   the edifice, and shorter-lived eruptions with high proportions of a’a
   to pahoehoe tend to generate steeper slopes higher on volcanoes.

   Sparse age-volume results suggest modest asymmetry in volcano growth,
   with rapid early increase in magma supply, followed by a more
   protracted waning stage. As detailed later, the only documented
   duration for early-alkalic stage volcanism (Kilauea) is fairly brief
   (∼150 k.y.), but volume and average magma supply are relatively large
   at Kilauea (∼2500 km^3, 0.017 km^3/yr) and Loihi (∼1000 km^3 in ∼125
   k.y., 0.008 km^3/yr), in comparison to late-stage alkalic volcanism at
   Mauna Kea (∼800 km^3 in 330 k.y., 0.0025 km^3/yr), Kohala (∼300 km^3 in
   ∼230 k.y., 0.0013 km^3/yr), Haleakala (300 km^3 in 950 k.y.: 0.0003
   km^3/yr), and none at Lanai (Sherrod et al., 2007).

   Shifts between compositional stages are probably all gradational to
   varying degree (Clague and Sherrod, in press). The shift from
   waxing-alkalic to tholeiitic stage is in progress at Loihi Seamount,
   where compositional types interfinger on upper slopes (Moore et al.,
   1982; Garcia et al., 1995a). Thick lava sequences also interfinger
   during prolonged transitions from sustained-tholeiite to waning-alkalic
   stage (described as “late-shield”; Sherrod et al., 2007) at Mauna Kea
   (Wolfe et al., 1997; Rhodes and Vollinger, 2004) and Kohala (Lanphere
   and Frey, 1987).

   Where stage transitions involve prolonged interfingering, dating of the
   change is inherently approximate. Perhaps the shift from early-alkalic
   to main-tholeiite stage should be defined by the initial appearance of
   abundant tholeiite (as currently at Loihi)—a time of increasing magma
   supply, when the continued eruption of alkalic basalt becomes
   volumetrically overwhelmed by tholeiitic lavas. For the change from
   main-tholeiite to late-alkalic stage, the transition could similarly be
   defined at the initial appearance of abundant transitional and alkalic
   lava. For the growth models in this overview, however, uncertainties
   about transition ages are rarely significant at the precision of
   available age control.

GROWTH AND MAGMA-SUPPLY MODELS

   Modeling growth of Hawaiian volcanoes is complicated by many
   interacting processes. Factors favoring augmented growth in edifice
   size and height include increasing lava-accumulation and magma-supply
   rates during the progression from early-alkalic to main-tholeiite
   stage, along with intrusion-driven inflation and expansion. At large
   tholeiite-stage edifices, volcano height can be negatively impacted by
   load-driven subsidence, summit deflation, caldera collapse, flank
   spreading, and catastrophic slope failures. All Hawaiian volcanoes
   likely increase in height rapidly during early submarine growth because
   of initially small size. Subaerial volcanoes rise more slowly, even
   when eruption rates are higher, as the volcano area becomes large and
   subsidence modulates growth by lava accumulation.

   Most previous volcano-growth models for Hawaii have portrayed
   age-volume relations as variants of a flattened bell curve, in which
   magma-supply and lava-accumulation rates increase during early growth,
   peak during the tholeiitic stage, and diminish during late alkalic
   volcanism. A perceptive early model for Mauna Kea (Wise, 1982; Fig. 3A)
   has been proposed with only modest differences for other volcanoes
   (Clague, 1987; Garcia et al., 1995a; Lipman, 1995).

   Duration of eruptive stages has also been evaluated by geodynamic
   models involving steady-state plate motion over a fixed hotspot, as
   recorded by volcano spacing (Fig. 3C–3D; Moore and Clague, 1992;
   DePaolo and Stolper, 1996; DePaolo et al., 2001), but eruptive behavior
   in Hawaii appears to be non–steady state over a wide range of scales.
   Magma supply has increased markedly during the last few million years
   (Bargar and Jackson, 1974; Clague and Dalrymple, 1987), volcano spacing
   along the young end of the Hawaiian Ridge varies by at least a factor
   of two (40–80 km), major fluctuations in magma-generation and eruptive
   processes are recorded by the gaps between islands and seamounts,
   volcano volumes vary by an order of magnitude (Table 2), propagation
   rates are inconsistent for some adjacent volcanoes, historical
   magma-supply and eruption rates have varied at individual volcanoes,
   and life spans of volcanoes also may vary substantially as discussed
   later. Simple time-volume models, such as depicted in Figs. 3A and 3B,
   likely are generalizations of magma-supply fluctuations with fractal
   geometry on time scales from decades or less to that for growth of
   individual volcanoes, entire islands, and the ocean-channel gaps that
   separate them.

   Determining long-term magma supply is especially challenging (Wright
   and Klein, 2013; Poland et al., in press). Short-term shallow magma
   supply at volcanoes like Kilauea has been estimated by combining
   historical observations, rates measured during eruptions, and intrusion
   volumes determined from geodetic data (Swanson, 1972; Dzurisin et al.,
   1984; Dvorak and Dzurisin, 1993; Cayol et al., 2000; Wright and Klein,
   2013). Changes in magma supply also have been inferred from
   lava-accumulation rates at dated stratigraphic sections (e.g., Lipman,
   1995; Sharp et al., 1996; Quane et al., 2000), but accumulation rates
   inevitably vary greatly with distance from vents and relation to local
   topography.

   Late growth histories of the older Hawaiian volcanoes that are extinct
   or nearly so are constrained by data from subaerial lavas, but
   reconstructions of early evolution depend heavily on deep-water
   sampling. Even with recent drill-hole and submarine sampling, no
   Hawaiian volcano exposes a complete record of all growth stages.
   Accordingly, to evaluate magma supply during assembly of Hawaii,
   eruption rates that have been determined for a stage at one volcano are
   used to approximate volume-age evolution at others. For each volcano,
   one or more growth models are developed for 100 k.y. intervals (25 k.y.
   for Kilauea and Loihi), constrained by available composition, age, and
   volume data, and also by analogies with growth stages at other
   volcanoes, to permit inter-volcano comparisons and to interpret overall
   growth of Hawaii (Table 3). As these growth models are variably
   subjective and dependent on data availability, uncertainties are
   accordingly large. One major uncertainty involves volcanoes of
   differing size and volume: do smaller volcanoes have briefer life spans
   than large ones, or are they characterized by lower eruption rates,
   especially during the main-tholeiite stage? Nevertheless, available
   age, compositional, and volume data provide a framework to infer
   overall growth histories and make comparisons with geodynamic models.
   The time-volume distributions can be adjusted to varying degrees
   without violating available data, but application of consistent
   assumptions to the entire suite of volcanoes potentially provides
   insights about their diverse histories and the composite assembly of
   Hawaii.

   Existing data are inadequate to evaluate whether the main-tholeiite
   stage is characterized by sustained near-constant magma supply (Fig.
   3A; Wise, 1982), by a bell-curve peak (Fig. 3B; Holcomb et al., 2000),
   or by major variability from volcano to volcano. For the historical
   time frame at Kilauea and Mauna Loa, eruption and magma-supply rates
   have fluctuated on intervals of decades to centuries, perhaps
   antithetically, with periods of intense eruptions alternating with
   sustained intervals of reduced activity (Stearns and Macdonald, 1946;
   Lipman, 1980a; Klein, 1982; Swanson et al., 2011; Wright and Klein,
   2013; Gonnermann et al., 2012; Poland et al., in press). Similar or
   longer-wavelength fluctuations are likely to have characterized earlier
   activity, but data to evaluate long-term trends are sparse.

   Because the volcanoes of Hawaii differ substantially in volume (by an
   order of magnitude or more; Table 2), either the duration of volcano
   growth or peak magma supply must vary greatly. Several alternatives are
   explored for growth of less-constrained volcanoes: (1)
   near-steady-state progression of volcano inception, in accord with
   plate-motion models; (2) semi-equal durations (∼1100 k.y.) but varied
   peak-eruption rates; and (3) shorter durations at smaller volcanoes
   that maximize peak-eruption rate during the tholeiite stage (Table 3).
   In addition, recent ages suggest that volcano progression has been
   asynchronous between the Kea and Loa trends (∼N35°W on Hawaii).
   Measured and modeled propagation rates and growth stages, discussed in
   later sections, suggest that volcanoes grew earlier along the Loa trend
   than for similar positions along the Kea trend, at least for the more
   recent volcanoes. Accordingly, growth along each trend is summarized
   separately, in general order from younger volcanoes to less-documented
   older ones.

   These discussions of available age, composition, and volume data, which
   are the framework for proposed growth models of individual edifices,
   provide the basis for evaluating overall island growth and resulting
   implications for geodynamic models of the Hawaiian hotspot/plume.
   Readers mainly interested in general interpretations and conclusions
   may prefer to go directly to the sections “Assembly of the Island of
   Hawaii” and “Discussion.”

KEA-TREND VOLCANOES

   Because age and volume data are more robust for the Kea trend, these
   volcanoes are discussed first, starting with Kilauea where composition,
   age, and eruptive evolution are constrained by study of its young
   subaerial deposits, abundant seismic and other geophysical data on
   three-dimensional structure, several multi-kilometer-deep drill holes,
   and especially the submersible dives and samples obtained during the
   Japan-USA research supported by JAMSTEC during 1998–2005 (Takahashi et
   al., 2002; Coombs et al., 2006a).

Kilauea

   Subaerial and underwater slopes of Kilauea display strikingly different
   records of growth. The on-land surface is mantled by tholeiite lava
   varying mainly in olivine content (Wright, 1971), mostly erupted <1.5
   ka (Holcomb, 1987; Neal and Lockwood, 2003). Interlayered thin tephra
   deposits record prolonged intervals of volumetrically minor explosive
   activity, during which lava eruptions were sparse (Fiske et al., 2009;
   Swanson et al., 2012). Drill holes along Kilauea’s subaerial east rift
   zone have penetrated similarly uniform tholeiites to depths as great as
   1700 m below present sea level (Quane et al., 2000).

   Offshore of Kilauea, all sampled pillow lavas along Puna Ridge, the
   submarine continuation of the east rift zone, are similar tholeiite
   (Clague et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2002). In contrast, no outcrops
   of Kilauea tholeiite have been found along the submarine south flank
   downslope from the summit. Below a prominent mid-slope bench at ∼3000
   mbsl (meters below sea level) (MSB, Fig. 1), bedded volcaniclastic
   rocks interpreted as debris-flow deposits from ancestral Kilauea
   (Lipman et al., 2002) contain clasts of diverse submarine-erupted (high
   sulfur) alkali basalt, including nephelinite and tephriphonolite
   (Sisson et al., 2002), that are more compositionally diverse than known
   elsewhere on Hawaiian volcanoes except during the late “rejuvenated”
   stage. These have been interpreted as recording initial growth of
   Kilauea, broadly comparable to the current Loihi Seamount but including
   less-evolved alkalic compositions. Breccia-matrix and turbidite sands
   interbedded with the debris-flow breccias contain glass grains of
   submarine-erupted alkali basalt, mixed with degassed tholeiitic grains
   generated by shoreline entry of subaerially erupted lavas. This
   submarine volcaniclastic sequence thins westward against breccias of
   Loa-type tholeiite interpreted as the underlying flank of Mauna Loa.
   Above the mid-slope bench, to the shallowest exposures at 1800 mbsl,
   scattered bedrock ribs expose only weakly alkalic to transitional
   pillow basalts (Fig. 4). The change to subaerial-type tholeiitic lavas
   must lie concealed in shallower water, beneath the angle-of-repose
   mantle of shoreline-derived hyaloclastite.

Age and Volume

   Prior geometric analysis of Kilauea’s volume, including contrasts
   between subaerial and submarine lava compositions, suggested a volume
   of ∼10,000 km^3 for the edifice, with about one-quarter emplaced during
   the waxing-alkalic stage (Lipman et al., 2006). This volume for the
   alkalic part of the edifice, substantially larger than that of Loihi
   Seamount at present, may have been modestly overestimated, because
   subaerially erupted shoreline-derived tholeiitic sand forms matrix
   between alkalic clasts in some deep debris-flow deposits. The prior
   estimate of total Kilauea volume also neglected deep parts of
   associated summit and rift-zone intrusions emplaced within the
   underlying Mauna Loa flank, here roughly approximated as an additional
   750–1000 km^3 (Appendix A, Table A1); further interpretation assumes a
   total Kilauea volume of ∼11,000 km^3.

   Multiple ^40Ar/^39Ar incremental-heating ages on early-alkalic and
   transitional basalts from Kilauea’s submarine south flank provide
   especially tight constraints on ancestral growth of this volcano, as
   well as a possible template for early evolution of other Hawaiian
   volcanoes (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006). Inception of Kilauea no earlier
   than ca. 250–275 ka is inferred from high-precision plateau ages of 234
   ± 9 and 238 ± 10 ka on phlogopite from nephelinites that record low
   magma supply generated by small degrees of source melting at initial
   stages of volcano growth. Ages on weakly alkalic pillow basalt above
   the mid-slope bench range down to 135 ka. Two ages from a thick breccia
   section of transitional lava are as young as 65 ± 28 ka (Hanyu et al.,
   2010), suggesting that main-stage tholeiites only became dominant at
   ca. 100 ka or even later (Fig. 4). These young ages for initial
   eruptions and shift to the tholeiite stage contrast with prior
   inference of earlier volcano inception (600–700 ka) based on
   plate-motion models (DePaolo and Stolper, 1996).

   Geothermal drill holes along Kilauea’s east rift have penetrated
   tholeiite sections 1700 m or more thick (Quane et al., 2000),
   documenting proximal emplacement of this basalt type at depths nearly
   to that of the shallowest alkalic pillows on the offshore slope,
   helping to bracket the shift between compositional stages and
   suggesting that the change may have been fairly abrupt. Drill-hole
   samples have ages as old as 351 ± 12 ka by the unspiked K-Ar method
   (Guillou et al., 1997b), but their reliability has been questioned
   because of inconsistency with ^40Ar/^39Ar dates from submarine alkalic
   rocks and potential for excess Ar and K loss to disturb ages in low-K
   samples (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006).

   Rare transitional flows and tephra with atypically high TiO[2] and
   alkalis at low SiO[2] (3 analyses of 437 tabulated for Kilauea; Wolfe
   and Morris, 1996b), erupted in the last few thousand years at Kilauea,
   support inference that the change to main-tholeiite stage is complex
   (Fig. 4) and may still be incomplete, consistent with the relatively
   modest current volume estimated for the growing volcano. Examples
   include the A.D. 600–1000 Kulanaokuaiki tephra (Dzurisin et al., 1995;
   Fiske et al., 2009), an associated lava flow (Lipman et al., 2006,
   their table 5), older flows of transitional basalt in Hilina fault
   scarps (Chen et al., 1996), and a young alkalic flow at the base of the
   distal Puna Ridge (Clague et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2002).

Magma-Supply and Growth Models

   A prior effort to model growth of Kilauea (Lipman et al., 2006), based
   on compositions and ages of submarine samples collected during JAMSTEC
   research, a revised edifice volume, and published estimates of
   late-20th-century magma supply (∼0.1 km^3/yr; Swanson, 1972; Dvorak and
   Dzurisin, 1993), became the starting point for this summary that
   refines the Kilauea result and applies similar methods to the older
   volcanoes.

   Diverse observations now suggest that magma supply at Kilauea has
   varied sizably in geologically recent time. Data from the continuing
   east rift eruption (since 1983) have documented varied eruptions rates,
   up to 0.2 km^3/yr (Wolfe, 1988; Wright and Klein, 2013; Poland et al.,
   2012). Interpretation of geodetic data suggests that the total magma
   supply has been close to 0.18 km^3/yr since 1961, including
   intermittent dike intrusions along rift zones during this interval
   (Cayol et al., 2000). Evaluation of the longer-term historical record
   of Kilauea eruptions, in conjunction with analysis of seismic data on
   magma-accumulation sites, also suggests supply rates to ∼0.18 km^3/yr
   since ca. 1960, increasing from 19th- and earlier 20th-century rates of
   only 0.01–0.08 km^3/yr (Pietruszka and Garcia, 1999; Wright and Klein,
   2013). Examination of prehistorical eruptive deposits has begun to
   document even more complex variability in eruptive rates at Kilauea,
   with multi-hundred-year periods of lava eruption at high rates
   alternating with similarly long intervals dominated by explosive
   eruptions of only modest volume (Swanson et al., 2011, 2012).

   Age-volume relations for the overall growth of Kilauea, as modeled here
   (Table 4; Fig. 5), show that magma-supply rates as high as 0.2 km^3/yr
   must be recent, intermittent, or both. Such a rate, if representative
   during the ∼100 k.y. duration of main-stage tholeiite eruptions, would
   have yielded a volcano volume almost twice that estimated from
   geometric modeling. Early growth during the waxing-alkalic stage at
   Kilauea is modeled to fit the estimated volume for this interval (∼2.5
   × 10^3 km^3, during 275–100 ka; Lipman et al., 2006), so even a
   present-day rate of 0.2 km^3/yr, constrained by a total Kilauea volume
   of ∼11,000 km^3, requires rapidly increasing average magma supply since
   100 ka, with a convex-upward slope that projects toward higher future
   rates (Fig. 5B). Such a supply rate also seems improbably high to be
   applicable for the sustained-tholeiite stages at older volcanoes. As
   presently modeled, a volcano as large as Mauna Loa could maintain a
   rate of 0.2 km^3/yr for at most 100 k.y., even if its
   sustained-tholeiite stage were relatively brief (∼700 k.y.; see section
   on Mauna Loa, especially Fig. 12). Even a lower present magma supply,
   reaching 0.1 km^3/yr at Kilauea after 100 k.y. in the
   sustained-tholeiite stage, produces a growth rate as high or higher
   than modeled for a modestly asymmetrical magma-time plot for other
   volcanoes (see sections on Kohala, Mauna Kea, and Hualalai, especially
   Figs. 9, 10, and 13; also Wise, 1982; Frey et al., 1990; Garcia et al.,
   1995a; Lipman, 1995). More rapid onset of tholeiitic magma supply to
   rates as high as 0.2 km^3/yr would require a strongly asymmetrical
   growth-time curve, relatively brief period of peak magma supply, and
   prolonged decline in supply rates.

   As an additional factor, the high supply rates estimated from geodetic
   and seismic data for rift extension during the past 50 years (Cayol et
   al., 2000; Wright and Klein, 2013) omit any component of passive flank
   motion and slumping driven by gravitational spreading (Fiske and
   Jackson, 1972; Borgia et al., 2000; Morgan et al., 2003; Byrne et al.,
   2013). The model of Cayol et al. (2000) infers average dike-induced
   rift opening of 40 cm/yr, which seems unsustainable for the prolonged
   duration of the tholeiitic stage at Kilauea. Such a dike-intrusion
   rate, if active since inception of tholeiite eruptions at ca. 100 ka,
   would have produced a zone 40 km wide of 100% dikes along Kilauea’s
   proximal east rift. In contrast, the intense dike swarm forming >40%
   (to 70%) of rock along the northwest rift at the deeply eroded Koolau
   volcano on Oahu, which appears geometrically analogous to Kilauea, is
   ∼10 km wide adjacent to its caldera and decreases to ∼5 km width 15 km
   down rift (Walker, 1986, 1987).

   Because of these complexities and uncertainties, the preferred model
   for long-term magma supply at Kilauea is that in Fig. 5A, gradually
   reaching a multi-thousand-year average of 0.1 km^3/yr since inception
   of its main-tholeiite stage at ca. 100 ka or younger.

Kohala

   Kohala is discussed before Mauna Kea because its overall growth history
   is better constrained by dating, providing a possible template for
   modeling early evolution of other Hawaiian volcanoes. Recent underwater
   studies provide unique information on early edifice growth at Kohala,
   long recognized as the oldest subaerial volcano on Hawaii, and show
   that this volcano is larger than previously thought (Table 2).

   Prior to the JAMSTEC-supported dives during 1998–2002, virtually all
   published compositional and age data for Kohala had been obtained on
   land, where mixed tholeiitic to weakly alkalic basalts (Pololu
   Volcanics) are capped by waning alkalic-stage lavas of the Hawi
   Volcanics (Stearns and Macdonald, 1946; Lanphere and Frey, 1987).
   However, many of the analyzed subaerial samples, especially tholeiites
   of the Pololu Volcanics, have been affected by variable to extreme
   alkali leaching and exchange (Lipman et al., 1990). Potassium-argon
   ages that have sizable uncertainties suggest that exposed Pololu rocks
   range from greater than 450 to ca. 300 ka, and that the overlying
   waning-alkalic lavas were erupted from ca. 280 to 120 ka, possibly as
   recently as 60 ka (McDougall and Swanson, 1972; Sherrod et al., 2007).
   Largely or entirely tholeiitic lower parts of the Pololu Volcanics
   become more compositionally diverse upward (Lanphere and Frey, 1987),
   recording a broad “late-shield” transition, here estimated at ca. 350
   ka (280 ka in Moore and Clague [1992]).

   A prominent slope break at 1000–1100 mbsl, continuously traceable for
   at least 60 km around the north submarine flank of the volcano, records
   submergence associated with waning of the sustained-tholeiitic stage at
   ca. 400 ka (Moore and Clague, 1992; Smith et al., 2002) and shows that
   Kohala was once much higher than its present summit elevation of 1678
   m. Two large submarine slope failures of Kohala’s north flank, the
   Laupahoehoe and Pololu slumps, occurred late during the
   sustained-tholeiite eruptions, then were onlapped by younger lavas from
   Mauna Kea (Smith et al., 2002). Only a few tholeiite lavas have been
   sampled from underwater slopes, but abundant turbidite sandstones from
   the submarine north flank (37 samples from 3 dives) have uniform
   tholeiitic glass compositions without intermixed transitional or
   alkalic compositions, providing an indirect record of a long-lived
   tholeiite stage at Kohala (Lipman and Calvert, 2011; M.L. Coombs, 2010,
   written commun.).

   The southeast-trending subaerial rift zone of Kohala is interpreted as
   continuing beneath Mauna Kea to reappear as the submarine Hilo Ridge
   (Figs. 1 and 6), as initially proposed by Holcomb et al. (2000) based
   on correlation of submarine slope breaks. This interpretation, in
   contrast to the more common depiction of Hilo Ridge as a rift zone of
   Mauna Kea (Fiske and Jackson, 1972; Moore and Clague, 1992; Wolfe et
   al., 1997), is supported by a residual-gravity anomaly along the Hilo
   Ridge that projects more directly toward Kohala than toward Mauna Kea
   (Kauahikaua et al., 2000) and by evidence for early inception of the
   ridge. Transitional to weakly alkalic pillow lavas that are overlain by
   tholeiitic picrite at the toe of Hilo Ridge (Fig. 7), interpreted to
   mark the change from waxing-alkalic to tholeiitic volcanism, have
   yielded ^40Ar/^39Ar plateau ages of ca. 1150 ± 35 ka (Lipman and
   Calvert, 2011). The ridge also has an overall reverse magnetic
   direction, requiring the bulk of rift growth before 760 ka (Naka et
   al., 2002, p. 46), much earlier than any dated tholeiitic lavas on
   subaerial Kohala (ca. 400 ka). By analogy with the 150–175 k.y. span
   interpreted for the waxing-alkalic stage at Kilauea, inception of
   early-alkalic volcanism at Kohala is estimated at 1300 ka (Table 5).
   These ages require the growth of Hilo Ridge before plausible inception
   of Mauna Kea related to semi-steady propagation along the Kea trend.
   For Hilo Ridge to be part of Mauna Kea would require rapid propagation
   from Kohala to Mauna Kea (at least 20 cm/yr, even if Kohala began as
   early as 1.5 Ma), then slowing greatly from Mauna Kea to Kilauea (∼5
   cm/yr).

   The reinterpreted Kohala east rift zone, as inferred from the summit to
   the distal toe of Hilo Ridge, is the longest among volcanoes on Hawaii
   Island (135 km). In comparison, Kilauea’s east rift zone, including its
   submarine extension along Puna Ridge, is 115 km long. The only longer
   Hawaiian rift zone would be the east rift zone of Haleakala and its
   submarine continuation along Hana Ridge, with an overall length of 150
   km.

   Hana Ridge offers an instructive geometric analog for evaluating size
   and geometry of the inferred rift-zone connection from subaerial Kohala
   to Hilo Ridge. This comparison can be illustrated (Fig. 8) by
   transposing major morphologic features of eastern Haleakala onto Kohala
   (present-day shoreline, submerged slope break at ∼2000 mbsl that marks
   decline in tholeiitic-stage eruptions, and approximate base of Hana
   Ridge adjusted on its north side for large-scale slumping). The
   distance from the present-day summits of the two volcanoes to submerged
   slope breaks along their ridge crests is similar (80–90 km), even
   though Hana Ridge continues 15 km farther underwater than the distal
   Hilo Ridge. The north-flank slope break is convex northward for both
   volcanoes, despite the presence of large submarine flank failures
   (Laupahoehoe slump for Kohala, Hana slump for Haleakala). The northward
   convexity along the northeast coast and submerged slope break of Hawaii
   results from younger infilling of lavas from Mauna Kea and also
   probably from late tholeiitic-stage Kohala (Smith et al., 2002, their
   figure 4). The geometrically similar convexity on the north flank of
   Hana Ridge probably records continued lava accumulation along this
   originally subaerial segment after slope failure generated the Hana
   slump (Eakins and Robinson, 2006). In contrast, the embayed south-flank
   slope break on Hana Ridge, which is asymmetrically close to the ridge
   crest, suggests that this side of the ridge was modified by late slope
   failures, and the resulting deposits are now concealed beneath younger
   rocks from the Island of Hawaii. Curvature of Hana Ridge appears
   somewhat less than that projected for the Kohala rift zone, but even
   so, the south flank of the transposed Hana Ridge would pass beneath
   Hilo and project beneath the summit of Mauna Kea.

Age and Volume

   Dates from subaerial samples of the waning-alkalic stage document a
   broad transition from tholeiitic eruptions at ca. 350–300 ka and
   probable termination of Kohala volcanism at ca. 120 ka (Sherrod et al.,
   2007). Interpretation of Hilo Ridge as the distal east rift of Kohala
   (Holcomb et al., 2000), in conjunction with ages of
   transitional-composition basalt at its toe (ca. 1150 ka; Lipman and
   Calvert, 2011), allows the first estimated duration for the
   sustained-tholeiite stage (∼800–850 k.y.) of a Hawaiian volcano. This
   duration is substantially longer than that inferred from prior
   plate-motion models (∼500 k.y. [Moore and Clague, 1992]; 600 k.y.
   [DePaolo and Stolper, 1996]).

   These results also imply that the 135-km-long east rift zone developed
   to near-total length early during growth of Kohala and imply a volume
   (Table 2) substantially larger than the prior estimate of 36,000 km^3
   (Robinson and Eakins, 2006). Any geometrically simple topographic
   profile connecting Hilo Ridge to Kohala requires the rift zone to have
   been subaerial at shallow depth beneath the north flank of Mauna Kea,
   limiting Mauna Kea to a much smaller volcano perched on the south slope
   of the large Kohala rift zone (Fig. 6). Kohala would have begun largely
   or entirely on ocean floor as an elongate northwest-southeast edifice
   without significant interference from pre-existing volcanoes. Rapid
   early growth of Hilo Ridge (Lipman and Calvert, 2011) suggests that at
   least distal parts of Kohala reached near-present size prior to major
   growth of Mauna Kea. Late interfingering of lavas from these volcanoes
   may have been relatively minor, as Kohala eruptions increasingly became
   focused closer to its present summit.

   A more modest addition to the total volume of Kohala results from
   reduced estimates for Mahukona, as discussed for that volcano. If the
   volume of Mahukona is ∼6000 km^3 (Garcia et al., 2012), or if this
   construct were the distal west rift zone of Kohala onlapped by a
   Hualalai rift, then half or more of its previously estimated volume
   (15,500 km^3; Robinson and Eakins, 2006) becomes part of Kohala. Based
   on a simple geometric model of elongate ellipsoidal prisms for Hilo
   Ridge and northwest rifts of Kohala, while retaining the smaller
   Mahukona estimate from Garcia et al. (2012), a revised volume for
   Kohala is ∼64,000 km^3 (Table 2; Appendix B, Table B2), nearly as large
   as previously estimated for Haleakala (69,800 km^3; Robinson and
   Eakins, 2006). Of this increased Kohala volume, 7500 km^3 was
   previously included with Mahukona and 20,000 km^3 with Mauna Kea (Hilo
   Ridge and landward continuation).

Growth Model

   By these volume interpretations, Kohala is among the largest Hawaiian
   volcanoes. Its lifespan (∼1200 k.y.) and duration of main-tholeiitic
   stage (∼800–850 k.y.) are relatively well constrained by the recent
   ages from the Hilo Ridge (Lipman and Calvert, 2011), in conjunction
   with prior K-Ar dating of its late-alkalic stage and analogy with
   duration of the early-alkalic stage at Kilauea. The Kohala ages provide
   the only measured duration for the main-tholeiite stage at a Hawaiian
   volcano, and simple geometric modeling of its growth as dominated by a
   mildly asymmetric trend of sustained tholeiite eruptions (Fig. 9A)
   yields peak magma-supply rates of ∼0.10 km^3/yr that are similar to
   estimates of long-term historical rates at Kilauea (Swanson, 1972;
   Dzurisin et al., 1984; Wright and Klein, 2013). A rate this high can
   characterize only a fraction of Kohala’s tholeiite stage; otherwise,
   its total volume would be even larger than the 64,000 km^3 estimated
   here (Table 2). An alternative growth model, in which magma supply
   becomes comparable to the 0.20 km^3/yr peak rate during recent Kilauea
   activity, produces a high-amplitude short-wavelength growth curve (Fig.
   9B) that could persist for only a brief interval without exceeding the
   total volume of this volcano. Even Mauna Loa, with its greater total
   volume, yields a compressed growth curve at such magma production
   rates. Such a short-duration high magma supply would also be
   inconsistent with a large-diameter hotspot source (100–150 km), as
   commonly inferred for the Hawaiian chain from diverse geochemical and
   geophysical evidence (e.g., Ribe and Christensen, 1999; DePaolo et al.,
   2001).

   No estimates have been published for volumes of the late-alkalic lavas
   at Kohala, but no more than a few hundred cubic kilometers seems
   likely, judging by the widely exposed transitional and tholeiitic flows
   low on subaerial slopes and absence of alkalic clasts or sand grains in
   landslide and turbidite deposits sampled on the north submarine flank
   during the JAMSTEC dives. For a volume of ∼300 km^3, erupted between
   350 and 120 ka, average late-alkalic magma supply would have been
   ∼0.0013 km^3/yr, significantly lower than for the shorter duration of
   waxing-alkalic eruptions at Kilauea or Loihi.

   Despite uncertainties, the time-volume plots for Kohala provide a
   possible template for inferring growth rates at other less-constrained
   volcanoes. Based on its interpreted inception at ca. 1300 (± 50?) ka,
   and that of Kilauea at 275 ka, the distance between these two volcanoes
   (88 km) yields a propagation rate of 8.6 ± ∼0.4 cm/yr. This rate,
   similar to that for the entire Hawaiian Ridge (8.6 ± 0.2 cm/yr; Clague
   and Dalrymple, 1987) and to current motion of the Pacific plate (∼7
   cm/yr; http://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/post/series.html), can then be used
   to infer inception ages for other volcanoes along the Kea trend. As
   discussed later, interpretation of propagation rates is more complex
   for volcanoes of the Loa trend.

Mauna Kea

   Based on reinterpretation of the size and shape of Kohala including the
   Hilo Ridge, Mauna Kea is interpreted as a topographically high edifice
   (4205 m) of relatively modest volume (22,000 km^3) among the volcanoes
   of Hawaii, which onlaps the flank of a much larger Kohala. The late
   eruptive record of Mauna Kea has been deciphered in detail, both from
   surface geology (Wolfe et al., 1997) and from the impressively
   documented HSDP holes targeted to penetrate Mauna Kea lavas near Hilo
   (DePaolo and Stolper, 1996; Sharp and Renne, 2005; Stolper et al.,
   2004; Rhodes and Vollinger, 2004; Stolper et al., 2009; among many
   publications). In contrast, the early growth history of Mauna Kea
   remains poorly known.

   The 3506 m HSDP2 hole (Stolper et al., 2009) contains an ∼500 k.y.
   record of upper parts of the sustained-tholeiite stage and the change
   to late-alkalic lavas. The lowermost 2 km of the HSDP hole consist of
   submarine-emplaced tholeiitic pillow lavas and hyaloclastite breccias,
   all tholeiitic but including more variable compositional subgroups than
   characterize other main-stage tholeiites such as at Mauna Loa (Stolper
   et al., 2004; Rhodes and Vollinger, 2004). Extrapolation of ^40Ar/^39Ar
   ages suggests that the submarine section accumulated from ca. 635 to
   400 ka (Sharp and Renne, 2005), when (at 1080 m depth in the hole) an
   abrupt change to subaerial lavas of similar tholeiitic composition
   continues to 352 m (ca. 330 ka). The entire 3.1 km tholeiitic sequence
   accumulated at an average rate of 8–9 mm/yr. Above 352 m to the top of
   the Mauna Kea section at 245 m (>200 ka), interlayered alkalic to
   tholeiitic lavas (Hamakua Volcanics) define evolution from the
   main-stage tholeiite to more uniform late-alkalic lavas and tephra
   (Laupahoehoe Volcanics) that are largely confined to upper subaerial
   slopes of the volcano. These compositionally transitional flows
   accumulated at a much lower average rate, ∼0.9 mm/yr (Sharp and Renne,
   2005), and were capped at ca. 100 ka by Mauna Loa lavas in the upper
   245 m of the hole.

   The oldest subaerial lavas on Mauna Kea, the Hamakua Volcanics, include
   interbedded tholeiitic and alkalic flows with ages (K-Ar determinations
   only) of ca. 300–65 ka (Wolfe et al., 1997; Sherrod et al., 2007). The
   Hamakua Volcanics therefore are at least largely correlative with the
   transitional-composition lavas at 352–245 m in the drill hole. The
   alkalic Laupahoehoe Volcanics on upper slopes of Mauna Kea have ages
   from 65 ka to 4–5 ka (summarized by Sherrod et al., 2007); no deposits
   in the HSDP hole are equivalent to the Laupahoehoe rocks.

   Diverse compositional, morphologic, and structural features of Mauna
   Kea are consistent with its interpretation as a relatively small
   volcano in volume, despite the high elevation of its summit. Without
   Hilo Ridge (here interpreted as a distal part of Kohala), Mauna Kea
   lacks morphologically or geophysically defined sizable rift zones.
   Late-alkalic vents scatter widely on its flanks without clear alignment
   that might reflect rift geometry, in contrast to more linear trends of
   late vents on volcanoes such as Haleakala, Kohala, and Hualalai. The
   volume of waning-stage alkalic lavas on Mauna Kea, estimated at 875
   km^3 (Wolfe et al., 1997), also seems large relative to overall size of
   this volcano, in contrast to 300 km^3 for the much bigger Haleakala
   edifice (Sherrod et al., 2003). The apparent less-complete development
   of a sustained-tholeiite stage at Mauna Kea, in comparison to other
   Hawaiian volcanoes, may be related to the lower magma-supply rates
   modeled in following sections.

   Additionally, the HSDP hole encountered compositional complexities in
   the 3.1 km main-tholeiite sequence (Stolper et al., 2004; Rhodes et
   al., 2012) that could be consistent with relatively small edifice
   volume, low magma supply, or interfingering with concurrently growing
   Kohala (compare projected location of Hilo Ridge’s south flank beneath
   Mauna Kea, at the HSDP site; Fig. 8). Almost a third (31%) of the
   submarine glass samples from the drill hole are low-Si tholeiite (<50%
   SiO[2]) that are atypical in the main-tholeiite stage at Kilauea and
   Mauna Loa (<1% of the analyses for these volcanoes, as tabulated by
   Wolfe and Morris [1996b]). Only about a third of the section, at
   800–1950 m depth corresponding to ages of ca. 380–515 ka (Sharp and
   Renne, 2005), consists mainly of high-Si tholeiite; within this
   interval are two excursions to low-Si tholeiite. Deeper in the hole,
   proportions of high- and low-Si tholeiite are subequal, and the longest
   interval without low-Si samples (2650–2800 m) has been interpreted to
   span only ∼20 k.y. (ca. 595–615 ka; Stolper et al., 2004; Sharp and
   Renne, 2005). These tholeiites are compositionally more variable than
   thick main-stage sequences where sampled on other volcanoes such as
   Mauna Loa (Garcia et al., 1995b) or Kilauea (Quane et al., 2000). The
   abundance of low-Si tholeiite at Mauna Kea is consistent with lower
   partial melting and magma supply during shield growth than typical of
   other Hawaiian volcanoes (Sisson et al., 2002).

   These compositional variations, and repeated alternation of subaerially
   erupted hyaloclastites with pillow basalts in the drill hole, might
   also in part result from interfingering with another concurrently
   growing volcano. In the drill hole at 2000–2900 m depth (ca. 520–625
   ka; Sharp and Renne, 2005), degassed hyaloclastites (erupted on land,
   quenched at the shoreline) interfinger with pillow lavas that erupted
   underwater. The Hilo Ridge crest, projected 15 km north of the HSDP
   site, would have been near sea level in the vicinity of the drill site
   during formation of the bench at 1100 mbsl (425–450 ka, estimated from
   isostatic subsidence at 2.4–2.6 mm/yr [Moore, 1987]). Hyaloclastites in
   the drill hole could have come from the shoreline of one volcano, while
   pillow lavas erupted from the other (Lipman and Calvert, 2011). High-Si
   tholeiites of Kea-trend volcanoes are petrologically similar, making
   sources challenging to distinguish, but isotopic studies also suggest
   lavas from more than one volcano in the drill hole: the “lost volcano”
   of Blichert-Toft and Albarede (2009).

Age and Volume

   Based on results from subaerial and the HSDP samples (Wolfe et al.,
   1997; Sharp and Renne, 2005), Mauna Kea progressed from main-tholeiite
   to late-alkalic stage during a lengthy transition interval from 330 to
   65 ka, and is now near the end of its lifetime, at least in terms of
   total eruptive volume. The subaerial edifice continued to grow during
   much of this interval, as indicated by the submerged offshore slope
   break that marks decline in growth, at a water depth of 400 mbsl with
   an estimated age of 130 ka (Moore and Clague, 1992). The prolonged
   transitional volcanism and delayed decline in subaerial growth at Mauna
   Kea is in contrast to these events at Kohala, where the compositional
   change and shoreline submergence appear to have been nearly concurrent
   at ca. 350 ka.

   The downward-revised volume estimate, from ∼42,000 to 22,000 km^3
   (Table 2; Appendix B, Table B3), results mainly from exclusion of Hilo
   Ridge and its landward projection beneath Mauna Kea. Also excluded is
   the Laupahoehoe slump area, depicted as part of Mauna Kea by Robinson
   and Eakins (2006) but interpreted here, and by Smith et al. (2002), as
   the northeast flank of Kohala overlain at a submerged slope break (1100
   mbsl) by Mauna Kea lavas. The southwestern boundary between Mauna Kea
   and Hualalai is inferred to involve steep interfingering, because these
   two volcanoes are interpreted to have grown concurrently, at similar
   distance along the trend of the Hawaiian Ridge, and with similar ages
   of eruptive decline as marked by 130 ka submerged slope breaks (400
   mbsl). Geometry of the deep boundary with Mauna Loa to the south is
   less certain, but also inferred to be steep in most sectors. Mauna Loa
   is only 25 km farther along the Hawaiian Ridge propagation trend, and
   the volcano-propagation model developed in a later section predicts
   nearly concurrent inception of these two volcanoes, resulting in large
   overlap in the sustained-tholeiite stages. In addition, Mauna Loa as
   the larger volcano may have a longer overall life span, and initial
   eruptions there could have begun earlier than projected from simple
   plate-motion models. Finally, because of higher magma-supply rates,
   Mauna Loa would likely have grown more rapidly and may have encroached
   on a concurrently active Mauna Kea.

   A relatively minor uncertainty involves the probability that deep
   solidified intrusions of Mauna Kea magma, which generate the positive
   gravity anomaly below the summit, continue at depth into the underlying
   flank of Kohala. Assuming that the total thickness of the Kohala flank
   could be as much as 10 km, reaching as shallow as sea level (Fig. 6),
   and that intrusive feeders and solidified tholeiite-stage reservoirs
   were as much as 5 km in radius beneath Mauna Kea, this volume could be
   ∼800 km^3, but well within uncertainties for the total volume. In the
   absence of geophysically detectable rift zones, no sizable volume of
   deep dike intrusions seems likely beneath the Mauna Kea edifice.

Growth Models

   As a mid-sized volcano, for which age and volume are well constrained
   only for late growth, the early history of Mauna Kea is modeled by
   analogy with information from other Hawaiian volcanoes. Based on
   propagation of 8.6 cm/yr along the Kea trend as bracketed by results
   from Kilauea and Kohala (Table 3), volcanism at Mauna Kea is modeled to
   have begun at 850 ka, with a relatively brief ∼400 k.y. duration for
   its sustained-tholeiite stage, and a likely peak eruption rate of ∼0.07
   km^3/yr (Table 6; Fig. 10A). Alternatively, if overall lifespan (1100
   k.y.) and duration of the sustained-tholeiitic stage (700 k.y.) were
   closer to that for Kohala, the peak eruption rate would have been
   lower, ∼0.06 km^3/yr (Fig. 10B). Such an early inception and long
   lifespan, however, would require divergent propagation rates between
   Mauna Kea and adjacent volcanoes, rapid from Kohala and much slower to
   Kilauea. In either case, the highest eruption rate is about two-thirds
   the 0.1 km^3/yr inferred for peak 100 k.y. intervals at Kohala or
   observed at present-day Kilauea. For Mauna Kea to have achieved even a
   brief interval of tholeiitic eruptions at a rate as high as 0.1
   km^3/yr, its modeled eruptive duration would have been shorter, ∼700
   k.y. with a sustained-tholeiite stage of only 250–300 k.y. (Fig. 10C),
   timing that appears inconsistent with the ages from deep in the HSDP
   hole (Sharp and Renne, 2005). With an estimated volume of 875 km^3
   (Wolfe et al., 1997) and a 330 k.y. duration for the prolonged
   transitional and waning-alkalic stage at Mauna Kea (Sharp and Renne,
   2005), its late-stage eruption rate is 0.003 km^3/yr, 1–2 orders of
   magnitude lower than that modeled for its earlier tholeiite stage
   (Table 6).

Haleakala

   As the youngest volcano north of Hawaii and the largest edifice in the
   Kea trend, Haleakala provides a framework for interpreting growth of
   the younger Kea-trend volcanoes. Haleakala has a volume estimated at
   ∼70,000 km^3 (Robinson and Eakins, 2006), an original summit probably
   4–5 km above sea level—1–2 km higher than the present summit (3055 m)
   as result of subsidence, and an exceptionally long rift zone—the 150 km
   Hana Ridge (Fig. 1).

   No observational data bear on early growth, but based on the size of
   Haleakala, propagation rate along the Kea trend, and analogy with
   younger volcanoes like Kohala, volcano inception is modeled at
   2000–2200 ka. A 900–1000 k.y. tholeiite stage ended at ca. 1000 ka,
   with estimated peak magma supply at ∼0.12 km^3/yr. Lava compositions
   alternated for at least 100 k.y. during the shift to waning-alkalic
   stage on land (available dates, 1100–970 ka; Chen et al., 1991), after
   which only alkalic lavas erupted. A widespread submerged slope break,
   at ∼2000 mbsl, is interpreted to record submergence of the subaerial
   shoreline at ca. 950 ka (Faichney et al., 2009), near the end of the
   tholeiite stage (Moore et al., 1990a; Eakins and Robinson, 2006). In
   contrast to Mauna Kea, some tholeiitic volcanism continued after
   inception of shoreline submergence, as indicated by dredged tholeiitic
   hyaloclastite along the ridge crest (Moore et al., 1990a).

   Diverse alkalic lavas then erupted for more than 900 k.y. at Haleakala
   (youngest flow, ca. A.D. 1600). The waning-alkalic rocks on Haleakala,
   accumulating concurrently with growth of Hawaii, formed a subaerial cap
   as much as 1 km thick but only ∼300 km^3 in volume (Sherrod et al.,
   2007). No distinct time break accompanies the compositional shift from
   lavas designated “postshield” (Kula Volcanics) to the more alkalic Hana
   Volcanics (Sherrod et al., 2003), which previously had been interpreted
   as a “rejuvenated stage” (Clague and Dalrymple, 1987). The average
   magma supply for this prolonged interval of late-alkalic volcanism is
   only 0.0003 km^3/yr, almost three orders of magnitude lower than during
   the main-tholeiite stage.

LOA-TREND VOLCANOES

   Growth and magma supply for the Loa-trend volcanoes are discussed
   separately from the Kea trend, because the two groups appear to have
   contrasting eruptive histories, propagation rates, and inception ages
   that diverge on Hawaii (see Discussion, especially Table 11 and Fig.
   15). A common propagation rate for the two trends would require the
   younger volcanoes along the Loa trend (Loihi, Mauna Loa) to have begun
   more recently than seems possible, as evaluated in a later section.

Loihi Seamount

   Upper slopes of Loihi, the youngest and smallest of the clustered
   volcanoes that form Hawaii Island, with a summit about a kilometer
   below sea level, contain interlayered alkalic, transitional, and
   tholeiitic basalts. These provided the first compelling evidence for a
   waxing-alkalic stage in Hawaii and showed that this volcano is
   currently in early transition to the sustained-tholeiite stage (Moore
   et al., 1982; Garcia et al., 1995a, 2006). No lavas have thus far been
   sampled at Loihi that are as mafic and primitive as the nephelinites
   and other highly alkalic rocks from the submarine south flank of
   Kilauea, and the increased proportions of Loa-trend tholeiite high on
   Loihi suggests a stage comparable to that of Kilauea at ca. 100–125 ka.
   Many published Loihi glass analyses that have been described as
   tholeiite are less silicic (<50% SiO[2], ∼3% total alkalis) than
   typical Loa-trend tholeiites from Mauna Loa or Hualalai; these would be
   classed as transitional or low-Si tholeiites in plots for other Loa or
   Kea volcanoes (Sisson et al., 2002; Stolper et al., 2004).

Age and Volume

   Inception of volcanism at Loihi was estimated at ca. 100 ka by Moore
   and Clague (1992), based on plate-motion modeling and inferred duration
   of early-alkalic volcanism. In contrast, from unspiked K-Ar age
   determinations (Guillou et al., 1997b), Garcia et al. (2006) inferred
   that Loihi eruptions had already begun on the sea floor at depths of
   ∼5000 m by 330–400 ka. Some reported Loihi ages are internally
   inconsistent with sample depth, however, and ages obtained by this
   method for young basalts can be too old because of potential effects of
   excess Ar (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006). Alternatively, based on rates
   of volcano propagation discussed in a later section and analogy with
   duration of the early-alkalic stage at Kilauea, Loihi is inferred to
   have commenced at ca. 100–150 ka. Although no ^40Ar/^39Ar isotopic ages
   have been determined yet for Loihi basalts, alkalic rocks from deep on
   the landslide-scarred eastern and western flanks could be sufficiently
   old to yield reliable dates.

   The volume of Loihi has been estimated as 1700 km^3, with lower parts
   of the edifice concealed beneath the volcaniclastic apron derived from
   subaerial Hawaii Island (Garcia et al., 2006; Robinson and Eakins,
   2006). By analogy with age-volume parameters for the waxing-alkalic
   volcanism at Kilauea, however, this volume at Loihi could have
   accumulated within 150 k.y. or less, also suggesting that the unspiked
   K-Ar ages are too old. In addition, the Loihi volume estimate seems
   high. Rather than initiated directly on deep-sea floor, Loihi appears
   to have grown over lower flanks of the large Punaluu slump derived from
   the south flank of Mauna Loa, where the latest major downslope movement
   is recorded by faulting in the Ninole Hills at 100–200 ka (Lipman et
   al., 1990; Jicha et al., 2012). If constructed on the Punaluu slump,
   much less of Loihi’s lower slopes would be concealed by younger
   volcaniclastic deposits, the erupted volume of the volcano would be
   significantly smaller at ∼800 km^3 (Appendix B, Table B4), and it could
   have grown to present size in 125 k.y. or less. This smaller volume
   estimate neglects dense olivine-rich cumulates within the Mauna Loa
   flank beneath the summit of Loihi. As discussed for Kilauea, such deep
   cumulate may be as much as 20% of total magma supply, and accordingly,
   the estimated total Loihi volume is reduced to 1000 km^3 (Table 2).
   Because Loihi is relatively young, its volume small, and magma supply
   low, such volume uncertainties play little role in modeling the overall
   growth of Hawaii.

Growth Model

   With likely inception at 100–150 ka, and a volume of ∼1000 km^3,
   Loihi’s growth would be dominated by increasing eruption rates during
   the waxing-alkalic stage (Fig. 11). Its in-progress shift to
   main-tholeiite stage, after erupting only about half the total volume
   as Kilauea at a similar stage, suggests that it may become a smaller or
   shorter-lived volcano. Loihi’s current volume would be comparable in
   size to Kilauea at ca. 150 ka (125 k.y. after initial Kilauea growth),
   and an inception age of 125 ka is modeled for Loihi (Table 7). For an
   earlier inception at 150–175 ka that would be most comparable to the
   early-alkalic duration at Kilauea, Loihi’s magma supply would be lower
   and seemingly less likely to have begun to erupt tholeiite. More recent
   inception at 100 ka would be consistent with a rapidly increasing magma
   supply, perhaps more appropriate for the shift to tholeiite. No data
   exist for present-day magma supply at Loihi, but by analogy with
   Kilauea’s transition to tholeiitic eruptions, the modeled rate of 0.03
   km^3/yr seems plausible.

   A more significant problem in relation to Kilauea is the
   volcano-propagation rate; Loihi is too distant for its inferred age.
   Projected along the composite Kea-Loa trend (N35°W), Loihi is 45 km
   southeast of Kilauea. Based on an inception age (125 ka) only 150 k.y.
   younger than for Kilauea, the propagation rate between these volcanoes
   would be an improbable 30 cm/yr (see Discussion, especially Table 11B).
   Even for inception of Loihi at 75 ka, the propagation rate would be
   22.5 cm/yr. Alternatively, at the Kea-trend propagation rate of 8.6
   cm/yr, activity at Loihi should not have commenced until 525 k.y. after
   Kilauea, ∼250 k.y. in the future (see Discussion, especially Table
   11A). A related problem with propagation rates between Mauna Loa and
   Kilauea is discussed next.

Mauna Loa

   As the largest volcano on Earth, rising ∼15 km above oceanic crust
   down-bowed beneath the Hawaiian Ridge, Mauna Loa dominates growth
   models for Hawaii. Its volume has been approximated at 80 × 10^3 km^3
   (Lipman, 1995), as much as 105 × 10^3 km^3 (Garcia et al., 1995b), and
   as little as 74 × 10^3 km^3 (Robinson and Eakins, 2006) by a model that
   did not include the substantial subsurface flank onlapped by Kilauea
   (Lipman et al., 2006). Despite its size amounting to 35%–50% of the
   volcanic volume of Hawaii, and in part because of it, the growth
   history of Mauna Loa is perhaps the least constrained of the island’s
   volcanoes.

   Historical eruptions, surface exposures of lavas as old as several
   hundred thousand years, on-land and underwater fault and landslide
   scarps as much as 1.6 km high, and the 245 m Mauna Loa section in the
   HSDP drill core, expose only tholeiitic lavas that have similar
   compositions modulated by olivine-control trends (Wright, 1971; Garcia
   et al., 1995b; Rhodes and Vollinger, 2004). No deep samples recovered
   to date provide compositional or age information bearing on an
   early-alkalic stage. While Mauna Loa continues to erupt frequently,
   diverse evidence suggests it is late in its main-tholeiite stage (Moore
   et al., 1990b; Lipman, 1995). Only three subaerial lavas (of 468
   analyses; Wolfe and Morris, 1996b) have transitional compositions, but
   several young-appearing underwater cones on Mauna Loa’s west submarine
   flank are alkalic (Wanless et al., 2006), hinting that a transition to
   late-alkalic volcanism may be imminent. Additional evidence for
   eruptive decline comes from ages and lava-accumulation rates in
   relation to island subsidence.

Age and Volume

   Several hundred surface flows from Mauna Loa have radiocarbon ages back
   to 30–40 ka, the effective resolution for this method (Lockwood, 1995),
   but older tholeiites have been a geochronometric challenge. Early
   attempts to analyze tholeiitic samples by K-Ar methods yielded ages
   with large analytical uncertainties, as well as some dates that are
   spurious on geologic grounds (Dalrymple and Moore, 1968; Lipman et al.,
   1990).

   Recent results by ^40Ar/^39Ar methods have met with greater success,
   although analyses of low-K tholeiites remain difficult and
   uncertainties large. A flow from the base of the Mauna Loa section in
   the HSDP core yielded a groundmass date of 132 ± 32 ka (Sharp et al.,
   1996), consistent with the age (ca. 100 ka) inferred from
   lava-accumulation and coastal-subsidence rates at this site (Lipman and
   Moore, 1996). In the most substantial effort thus far, 11 dates on
   submersible and dredge samples from the 1.6-km-long scarp along Ka Lae
   Ridge (underwater southwest rift zone, Fig. 1) are broadly consistent
   with stratigraphic position, defining slowing of eruptions at ca. 400
   ka while documenting that Mauna Loa was already a large subaerial
   volcano by that time (Jicha et al., 2012). A deeper sample dredged from
   the distal ridge yielded an age of 657 ± 175 ka, further helping
   delimit inception of tholeiitic volcanism at Mauna Loa. On the
   submarine west flank, a few ages in the range 240–460 ka, with large
   analytical uncertainties, have been obtained from tholeiites that have
   compositions similar to recent Mauna Loa lavas (Morgan et al., 2007).
   In addition, two tholeiite samples from the Ninole Hills on Mauna Loa’s
   south flank yielded ages of 227–108 ka, demonstrating that by this
   time, the subaerial Mauna Loa edifice was approaching its present size.
   This geochronologic evidence for early rapid growth to form Ka Lae
   Ridge, followed by a lengthy period of eruptive decline later during
   the main-tholeiite stage at Mauna Loa, support a general model of
   asymmetric growth during the lifespan of Hawaiian volcanoes, as
   initially diagrammed perceptively by Wise (1982).

   The volume of Mauna Loa, estimated here as 83 × 10^3 km^3 (Appendix B,
   Table B5), adjusts the Robinson and Eakins (2006) value of 74 × 10^3
   km^3, based on a substantially reduced volume of Kilauea and increased
   volume of Hualalai. Because Kilauea onlaps the south flank of Mauna Loa
   (Lipman et al., 2006), the volume of Kilauea is here estimated at 11 ×
   10^3 km^3, in contrast to the previous 32 × 10^3 km^3 (Robinson and
   Eakins, 2006). Inferred to offset some of this component, however, is
   evidence from gravity data that the south rift zone of Hualalai
   continues beneath the west flank of Mauna Loa for at least 20 km beyond
   any surface outcrops of Hualalai lavas (Kauahikaua et al., 2000).
   Accordingly, Hualalai is interpreted to be larger than previously
   estimated, at the expense of Mauna Loa volume (Table 2).

   Two additional difficult-to-evaluate uncertainties further complicate
   these volume estimates: (1) a plausible but untested inference that the
   relatively short present northeast rift of Mauna Loa formerly may have
   continued beneath the east rift and Puna Ridge of Kilauea (Lipman,
   1980b, p. 772; Flanigan and Long, 1987), and (2) a proposal that
   Hualalai’s south rift zone might once have continued as far south as Ka
   Lae Ridge (Holcomb et al., 2000). Neither of these alternatives can be
   evaluated unambiguously from available data. As possible support for
   alternative 2, a drowned seacliff along Ka Lae Ridge (Moore et al.,
   1990b; Garcia et al., 1995b) is similar in depth (430–450 m) to a
   submerged reef that drapes the northwest (Kiholo Ridge) of Hualalai
   (Moore and Clague, 1992). Alternative 1 would further increase the
   volume of Mauna Loa relative to that of Kilauea because much of
   Kilauea’s volume as currently interpreted resides in its long east rift
   zone (∼3000 km^3, 30% of total Kilauea volume in just the submarine
   Puna Ridge; Lipman et al., 2006). Alternative 2, discussed further in
   the section on Hualalai, if valid, would increase that volcano’s volume
   substantially and reduce Mauna Loa’s. If both alternatives were valid,
   impact on the volume of Mauna Loa could be modest. Either alternative
   would transfer volume to an older adjacent edifice, thereby augmenting
   conclusions concerning timing of peak overall growth of Hawaii.

   An additional proposal, that an ancient buried “Ninole rift zone”
   underlying the south flank of Mauna Loa predates the present-day
   configuration of the southwest rift (Morgan et al., 2010), is
   inconsistent with isotopic ages that are older for distal southwest
   rift lavas (400–650 ka) than for the Ninole Basalt (100–200 ka; Lipman
   et al., 1990; Jicha et al., 2012). Profiles of high seismic velocity
   and positive gravity, cited as evidence for a Ninole rift (Morgan et
   al., 2010, their figures 2 and 4), appear to have juxtaposed the large
   velocity/density anomaly associated with the summit magma reservoir of
   Mauna Loa and analogous geophysical expression of Kilauea’s distal
   southwest rift.

Growth Models

   Multiple scenarios are possible for Mauna Loa’s growth, depending on
   estimates of its lifespan. As the largest Hawaiian volcano, would
   duration of its growth also be relatively lengthy? The recent
   ^40Ar/^39Ar ages from Ka Lae Ridge (Jicha et al., 2012) appear to
   document 600 k.y. or more of sustained eruption of compositionally
   similar tholeiite, without any hint of inception. If a duration of
   100–150 k.y. is assumed for an early-alkalic stage by analogy with
   Loihi and Kilauea, and a future late-alkalic stage of ∼200 k.y., the
   lifespan of Mauna Loa would be at least 900 k.y.

   Mauna Loa and Kilauea are the only Hawaiian volcanoes for which
   historical records and geologic mapping of young prehistoric flows
   provide quantitative data on eruption rates and magma supply. Total
   lava output for the 170 years of historical record (A.D. 1843–2012) is
   ∼4.1 km^3 (Lockwood and Lipman, 1987), or 0.024 km^3/yr. Detailed
   mapping of prehistoric lava flows on Mauna Loa suggests a roughly
   similar rate for at least the past 3000 years (Trusdell, 2010).

   Intrusive contributions to the recent magma supply of Mauna Loa are
   difficult to estimate but seem likely to be less than at Kilauea where
   the rift-bounded south flank is spreading seaward much more rapidly
   than its geometric counterpart on Mauna Loa (Miklius et al., 1995;
   Miklius and Cervelli, 2003). The long-term intrusive contribution to
   Kilauea’s magma supply has been estimated at 30%–50% (Dvorak and
   Dzurisin, 1993; Cayol et al., 2000; Wright and Klein, 2013; Poland et
   al., in press); an assumed 30% for Mauna Loa would yield a historical
   magma supply of ∼0.035 km^3/yr, only about a third of the estimated
   average historical rate at Kilauea (∼0.1 km^3/yr).

   In addition to isotopic and historical age data, coastal
   lava-accumulation rates and ages of submerged shorelines and coral
   reefs provide evidence for decline in magma supply late during the
   tholeiite stage. While Mauna Loa has been interpreted to be continuing
   vigorous growth because its historical lava volume (4.1 km^3), if
   spread uniformly over the subaerial volcano (5125 km^2), would have an
   average lava-accumulation rate of ∼5 mm/yr (Jicha et al., 2012),
   coastal accumulation has been insufficient to grow the subaerial
   edifice. About a quarter of historically erupted lava has ponded within
   the summit caldera (Lockwood and Lipman, 1987), some historical
   eruptions crossed the shoreline to deposit on submarine slopes, and
   much of the on-land lava accumulated preferentially in proximity to
   vents high on the edifice. With adjustments for these factors, overall
   coverage rates for subaerial slopes during the historical period
   averages only ∼3 mm/yr, and coastal rates would necessarily be lower.
   With shoreline subsidence at ∼2.6 mm/yr (Moore, 1970, 1987; Ludwig et
   al., 1991), the historical period thus provides little evidence for
   continued vigorous growth, or even maintaining the subaerial size of
   the edifice.

   Along much of the present coastline, average lava accumulation is only
   approximately keeping pace with subsidence (Lipman, 1995), even though
   the on-land area of Mauna Loa has decreased by ∼20% as Kilauea has
   grown above sea level and overlapped the south flank of its large
   neighbor. The low rate of subaerial lava accumulation for Mauna Loa is
   well documented in the HSDP core, where average accumulation has been
   balanced by subsidence since at least ca. 100–120 ka (Lipman and Moore,
   1996), despite funneling of Mauna Loa flows toward the drill site, from
   its northeast rift into the broad valley between Mauna Kea and the
   growing Kilauea shield.

   The dated decline in lava accumulation at ca. 400 ka along the
   submarine southwest rift zone (Jicha et al., 2012) may result mainly
   from the apparent tendency for Hawaiian rift zones to be established
   early during volcano growth, then to become less active (“drying up”)
   as tholeiite eruptions become focused higher on the growing edifice
   (Moore and Clague, 1992; Lipman and Calvert, 2011). Alternatively,
   reduced activity along the lower southwest rift may have been caused by
   dislocations in response to large-scale landslides and slumps along
   Mauna Loa’s west flank (Lipman, 1980b; Lipman et al., 1990). Whatever
   the initial cause, decline in lava-accumulation rate along the lower
   southwest rift is further documented by a submerged paleo-shoreline,
   marked by an ∼10-m-high sea cliff with wave-rounded boulders at its
   base, 450 mbsl, with an interpreted age of 170 ka (Moore et al., 1990b;
   Garcia et al., 1995b).

   Growth of the submarine Ka Lae Ridge (Fig. 1) to near present size by
   400 ka (Jicha et al., 2012) and maintenance of its subaerial shoreline
   8.5 km seaward of the present one until ca. 170 ka demonstrate that
   Mauna Loa already was a large subaerial edifice by these times, with
   topographic profiles projecting close to its present slopes.
   Accordingly, growth models developed here (Table 8) assume substantial
   decline in tholeiite eruption rates, starting ca. 400 ka. Even if
   volcano inception began as early as ca. 950 ka, about concurrently with
   Mauna Kea (and requiring a long gap before initial volcanism at Kilauea
   at ca. 275 ka), peak sustained magma supply for 100 k.y. periods at
   Mauna Loa likely approached 0.17 km^3/yr (Fig. 12B), 50% greater than
   for present-day Kilauea. Alternately, if inception of Mauna Loa were
   younger, at ca. 850 ka, to allow for a more nearly constant age
   progression among the island’s volcanoes, the time interval for
   main-stage tholeiite magma supply becomes shorter and the estimated
   peak rate higher, ∼0.20 km^3/yr (Fig. 12A).

   The timing of volcano inception at Mauna Loa, as at Loihi, is a special
   problem in relation to propagation along the Kea trend. While Loihi is
   too distant from Kilauea to have a propagation rate consistent with
   motion of the Pacific plate, the proximity of Mauna Loa to Kilauea (23
   km, along the composite volcano trend) would imply volcano inception at
   only ca. 540 ka, at the average progression rate (8.6 cm/yr) for the
   Kea trend (see Discussion, especially Table 11). Modeling of young
   inception of Mauna Loa (at ca. 540 ka) would also require extremely
   high magma production during the peak-tholeiitic stage (∼0.5 km^3/yr at
   450 ka) that then declined rapidly to the present-day rate of ∼0.035
   km^3/yr (Fig. 12C). Such a recent inception for Mauna Loa seems
   inconsistent, however, with dates as old as 657 ± 175 ka (Jicha et al.,
   2012) on submarine tholeiite from Ka Lae Ridge. Alternatively, Mauna
   Loa and Loihi could record volcano inception asynchronously older by
   several hundred thousand years than for counterparts along the Kea
   trend. Such an interpretation seems required by the young ages for
   waxing-alkalic growth of Kilauea (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006).

Hualalai

   Hualalai appears to have begun growing before Mauna Kea even though it
   has erupted more frequently in recent time. The location of Hualalai
   slightly farther northwest along the Hawaiian Ridge suggests earlier
   inception, it appears to have grown mainly on ocean floor rather than
   on the flank of another volcano, and its estimated volume is larger
   than Mauna Kea. Its relatively small surface exposures are deceptive
   because of widespread cover by Mauna Loa, probable submarine overlap of
   Mahukona, and large-scale flank failure along the west coast. Hualalai
   remains active, in its late-alkalic stage (Moore et al., 1987), but the
   relatively infrequent eruptions are not keeping pace with shoreline
   subsidence (Moore and Clague, 1992). Future volumetric growth will be
   modest.

   Subaerial Hualalai exposes only waning-stage alkalic lavas, but
   tholeiite crops out offshore and has been penetrated above sea level in
   water wells (Moore et al., 1987; Cousens et al., 2003). The topographic
   summit of alkalic basalt lies 5–7 km north of the gravity maximum that
   likely images intrusions associated with the tholeiitic stage
   (Kauahikaua et al., 2000), perhaps reflecting late vent migration in
   response to buttressing by Mauna Loa (Lipman, 1980b). Northwest- and
   south-trending rift zones are marked by late-alkalic vents that
   coincide with residual-gravity highs, in contrast to absence of similar
   alignments on Mauna Kea. The underwater continuation of the northwest
   rift zone (Kiholo Ridge) has bathymetric expression for >70 km from the
   subaerial summit (Fig. 1), and the associated gravity high continues to
   the Mahukona platform (Garcia et al., 2012). The south rift zone can be
   traced for at least 40 km, including its gravity expression beyond
   exposed Hualalai lavas (Kauahikaua et al., 2000).

Age and Volume

   As for most old volcanoes on the island, direct information is
   unavailable for inception of the early-alkalic stage or the change to
   tholeiitic volcanism. A submerged slope break and coral reef, widely
   traceable at ∼400 mbsl and dated at ca. 130 ka, mark decline in
   main-stage activity at Hualalai, although some tholeiitic flows drape
   the reef (Moore and Clague, 1987). Trachyte lavas at Puu Waawaa on
   Hualalai’s north flank, inferred to record beginning of the
   waning-alkalic stage, have K-Ar ages as old as 114 ka (Clague, 1987;
   Cousens et al., 2003). The shift from tholeiite to waning alkalic
   stages is thus closely bracketed, <130 to >114 ka.

   The volume of Hualalai, previously estimated at 14,200 km^3 (Robinson
   and Eakins, 2006), is particularly uncertain because of cover by Mauna
   Loa lavas, gravitational failure of its southwest flank (North Kona
   slump), difficulty in tracing extent of rift zones, and likely complex
   interfingering with Mauna Kea to the east. A larger estimate of 26,000
   km^3 (Table 2; Appendix B, Table B6) is based on assumption that the
   perimeter of subaerial Hualalai lies 5–15 km beyond present exposures,
   onlapped by Mauna Loa flows, and that distal rift zones continue
   farther than estimated by Robinson and Eakins (2006).

   An additional uncertainty is the speculative proposal that deeper parts
   of Ka Lae Ridge could be the distal continuation of Hualalai’s south
   rift (Holcomb et al., 2000). No petrologic distinctions are known
   between Mauna Loa versus Hualalai tholeiites that could help evaluate
   this alternative, but a Hualalai connection could be consistent with
   the abrupt decline in eruption rate at ca. 400 ka at Ka Lae Ridge
   (Jicha et al., 2012). Gravity data show a density gap between Hualalai
   and the southwest rift of Mauna Loa (Kauahikaua et al., 2000); however,
   making such an interpretation seem improbable. In addition, a lengthy
   south rift of Hualalai all the way to Ka La Ridge would likely have
   formed a structural barrier to large slope failures (as on the
   northeast side of Mauna Kea), but the west side of Mauna Loa instead
   has been the site of numerous giant landslides and slumps. If Ka Lae
   Ridge were part of Hualalai, its volume would be considerably larger,
   perhaps 45,000–50,000 km^3, and that of Mauna Loa accordingly smaller.
   Broader implications of this uncertain hypothesis (Holcomb et al.,
   2000) are considered further in the section on overall assembly of
   Hawaii.

Growth Models

   As a mid-sized volcano, for which age and volume are well constrained
   only for late growth, Hualalai’s earlier eruptive history is modeled by
   analogy with other volcanoes. Based on distance from Mauna Loa (37 km)
   and a Loa-trend propagation rate (10.6 cm/yr), Hualalai would have
   begun at ca. 1100 ka, with a relatively long sustained-tholeiite stage
   (Table 9A; Fig. 13A). Without inclusion of Ka Lae Ridge, peak
   tholeiitic magma supply would have been ∼0.05 km^3/yr (Fig. 13A), about
   half that inferred for peak 100 k.y. intervals at Kohala or observed at
   present-day Kilauea. For Hualalai to have a tholeiitic stage
   approaching 0.1 km^3/yr, its eruptive duration would have been several
   hundred thousand years shorter than at Kohala (Table 9B; Fig. 13B).
   With a rough volume estimate of 500 km^3 and a 115 k.y. duration for
   the waning-alkalic stage at Hualalai, the late-stage eruption rate
   averages 0.004 km^3/yr, similar to that for Mauna Kea but an order of
   magnitude or more lower than during the sustained-tholeiite stage.

Mahukona

   The broad Kohala platform extending ∼50 km offshore from northwest
   Hawaii (Fig. 1), first proposed as the site of a submarine volcano by
   Stearns and Macdonald (1946, p. 56), was named Mahukona volcano and
   inferred to mark initial volcanism of Hawaii (Moore and Campbell,
   1987). Dredging and submersible sampling have recovered tholeiitic,
   transitional, and weakly alkalic basalt along the broad ridge at the
   west end of the platform, which has been interpreted as the “missing
   volcano” along the Loa trend between Kahoolawe and Hualalai (Garcia et
   al., 1990; Clague and Moore, 1991). Most sites yielded tholeiite;
   transitional to weakly alkalic basalt has been recovered mainly from
   the large cone that forms the youngest part of Mahukona as currently
   interpreted. The eastern extent of Mahukona is hidden beneath the
   Kohala platform, which contains a stepped succession of at least six
   drowned coral reefs. Isotopic ages from the coral constrain late growth
   and termination of volcanism at Mahukona, as well as island subsidence
   rates (Moore and Campbell, 1987; Moore and Clague, 1992).

Is Mahukona Really a Volcano?

   Despite much elemental and isotopic chemistry, ^40Ar/^39Ar age
   determinations, and detailed bathymetric and gravity surveys,
   uncertainty continues about the shape and volume of the Mahukona
   construct, location of its summit, whether the edifice ever rose above
   sea level, causes of compositionally diverse lavas, timing of the
   change from tholeiitic to late-alkalic stages, and even whether this
   feature constitutes a discrete volcano. Analogous interpretive
   ambiguities and possible alternative origins also exist for several
   other shallow elongate platforms offshore of older Hawaiian islands:
   Penguin Bank southwest of Molokai, Kaena and Waialu Ridges west of
   Oahu, and Pauwela Ridge north of Maui (Robinson et al., 2006).

   Garcia et al. (1990, 2012) inferred a relatively small Mahukona
   seamount, having an area of ∼1600 km^2, and a summit location marked by
   a large steep-sided cone that grew only to ∼270 mbsl. In contrast,
   Clague and Moore (1991) and Clague and Calvert (2009) interpreted a
   larger edifice that formerly rose above sea level, as now marked by a
   submerged platform ∼30 km across that contains a filled caldera. These
   contrasting views are closely tied to alternative interpretations of
   the submarine slope breaks that mark the end of sustained-tholeiitic
   growth in relation to ages of coral reefs on the platform (Fig. 1).
   Clague and Moore (1991) interpreted reef 6 and associated slope break
   as the paleo-shoreline of Mahukona, and correlated the Kohala
   tholeiitic shoreline with a shallower coral reef at 950 mbsl (reef 4)
   on the platform. They also interpreted “trains of basalt rubble in
   chutes” (Clague and Moore, 1991, p. 161) on an intermediate-depth reef
   (∼1150 mbsl, reef 5) as erupted from Mahukona, requiring that its
   summit lay to the east. All the reefs on the Kohala terrace are tilted
   southward in response to volcanic loading on the Hawaiian Ridge (Moore
   and Campbell, 1987), however, and the deeper reefs (5–6) rise and merge
   northward with a single slope break at a depth of ∼1000 mbsl. This
   break continues clockwise around the north flank of Kohala volcano and
   marks the decline of tholeiitic eruptions (Moore and Clague, 1992;
   Smith et al., 2002).

   Recent geophysical, bathymetric, and petrologic data provide additional
   perspectives on complexities and uncertainties concerning the summit
   location and shape of Mahukona. An elliptical positive residual-gravity
   anomaly that trends northwest from Hualalai (Garcia et al., 2012, their
   figure 4) coincides with neither of the proposed summit locations nor
   the morphologically expressed west-trending Mahukona ridge. Absence of
   a dense core sufficient to generate a gravity anomaly at Mahukona was
   inferred to result from slow growth and small size (Garcia et al.,
   2012), but other Hawaiian volcanoes, and even the relatively small
   Loihi Seamount at an early growth stage, have large positive gravity
   anomalies associated with summits and proximal rift zones (Kinoshita et
   al., 1963; Strange et al., 1965; Kauahikaua et al., 2000). Absence of a
   positive anomaly marking a Mahukona summit would seem especially
   problematic for a relatively large edifice hosting a summit caldera and
   accompanying shallow magma chamber, such as proposed by Clague and
   Moore (1991). In addition, the broad Kohala platform seems puzzling
   morphologically for a waning-alkalic stage of a Hawaiian volcano; such
   late volcanism typically generates steeper slopes than the tholeiite
   stage.

   As an additional complexity, tholeiitic lavas attributed to Mahukona
   are unusually diverse in elemental and isotopic composition, including
   subequal proportions of Loa and Kea types (Clague and Moore, 1991;
   Garcia et al., 2012). This variability, which differs from the other
   volcanoes of Hawaii Island, might be related to a diffuse magmatic
   system without a long-lived central reservoir, or possibly to
   overlapping by nearby volcanoes. For this last speculative alternative,
   based on geometry of the gravity anomaly and the mixture of Kea and Loa
   compositions, no discrete Mahukona volcano need exist. Instead, the
   western ridge of the Kohala platform perhaps could be an early-formed
   broad rift zone from Kohala (Kea composition), onlapped by continuation
   of the northwest rift zone from Hualalai (Loa composition). A larger
   analog for such distal widening of a submarine rift could be the
   landside-modified tip of the Hana Ridge of Haleakala (Eakins and
   Robinson, 2006). If part of the Mahukona edifice were a west ridge of
   Kohala, this rift would be ∼100 km long, and Kohala in broad form would
   be a 230-km-long ridge, paralleling the arcuate south flank of the
   clustered older volcanoes of Maui Nui (submerged platform of Maui,
   Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe).

Volume and Age

   The volume of any Hawaiian volcano is inherently difficult to
   determine, because of uncertainties about edifice overlaps and effects
   of crustal subsidence beneath the Hawaiian Ridge. For Mahukona, these
   complexities are augmented by the uncertainties concerning volcano
   area, summit location, and origin. Possible alternatives include: (1)
   small western edifice, volume of ∼6000 km^3 (Garcia et al., 1990,
   2012); (2) larger edifice with summit farther east and a concealed
   flank onlapped by Kohala (Clague and Moore, 1991; Clague and Calvert,
   2009), volume here estimated as ∼20,000 km^3; or speculatively (3) even
   absence of Mahukona as a discrete volcano. In absence of positive
   evidence for alternative 3, or gravity data in support of alternative
   2, models for this overview are based conservatively on the ∼6000 km^3
   estimate of Garcia et al. (2012). Because the volume of the Mahukona
   construct would be relatively small by whatever alternative, none of
   them substantially affects broad conclusions of overall magma supply
   and eruption rates during composite growth of Hawaii, discussed later.

   Age estimates are also problematic, because of uncertainties concerning
   which dates are reliably associated with growth at Mahukona. Based on a
   coral age from the 1350-mbsl shelf break at reef 6, Clague and Moore
   (1991) estimated that tholeiite-stage eruptions began to decline by ca.
   470 ka but persisted to at least 430 ka, the coral age of reef 5 that
   is draped by tholeiitic rubble inferred from Mahukona. Recent
   ^40Ar/^39Ar ages from transitional basalt on the shallow cone along the
   western Mahukona ridge are 300–350 ka (Clague and Calvert, 2009; Garcia
   et al., 2012), probably representing the near termination of eruptions.
   An age of 481 ± 37 ka for transitional basalt from deeper on the flank
   of the same cone suggests a possibly prolonged interval of waning
   volcanism, but no highly alkalic lavas have been sampled at Mahukona.
   An age of 654 ± 36 ka on tholeiite from a deeper cone farther west
   provides another limit on late activity (Garcia et al., 2012).
   Generalizing from these results, the putative Mahukona volcano is
   interpreted to have changed from main-tholeiite to late-alkalic stage
   at ca. 400–450 ka and to have terminated by 300 ka. No data exist for
   waxing-alkalic stage at Mahukona, but the bulk of this edifice must be
   tholeiite; only two sites have yielded transitional samples.

Growth Model

   A 6000 km^3 volume for Mahukona would imply growth markedly different
   from larger Hawaiian volcanoes. If its lifespan were comparable to
   volcanoes such as Kohala (∼1200 k.y.), then even with prolonged
   (100–200 k.y.) waxing and waning stages, peak magma supply would have
   been ∼0.01 km^3/yr, an order of magnitude less than for larger
   volcanoes or present-day Kilauea. Peak tholeiite activity at even half
   the rate of larger volcanoes would require a much briefer lifespan (600
   k.y. or less), but this would delay inception of Mahukona until ∼400
   k.y. later than initial activity at adjacent Kohala or predicted from
   geodynamic models of volcano propagation.

Kahoolawe

   In parallel to Haleakala on Maui Nui, the growth history of Kahoolawe
   bears on initiation of the Loa trend on Hawaii, but modern geologic
   data are sparse because of island use as a military bombing range.
   Available K-Ar ages roughly define the end of sustained-tholeiite
   eruptions at ca. 1200 ka, followed by late-alkalic volcanism until ca.
   900 ka (Sherrod et al., 2007); analogies with other volcanoes suggest
   inception at 2100–2250 ka (Table 3).

ASSEMBLY OF THE ISLAND OF HAWAII

   Composition, age, and volume data for individual volcanoes, while of
   uneven quality, quantity, and completeness, provide a framework for
   modeling the composite growth of Hawaii Island. Ages and volumes have
   been combined for three alternative magma-supply models for 100 k.y.
   intervals from each volcano: (1) near-constant propagation of volcano
   inception; (2) near-equal lifespan, varied peak-tholeiite rate; and (3)
   varied duration, high peak-tholeiite rate (Table 10). These models then
   can generate age-volume growth plots for the entire island (Fig. 14).

   Somewhat unexpectedly, the three growth models yield generally similar
   results despite the varied assumptions and inputs. Each model has a
   broad peak of high magma supply (20–35 × 10^3 km^3/100 k.y.) from ca.
   400 to 800 ka, when four Hawaiian volcanoes (Kohala, Hualalai, Mauna
   Kea, Mauna Loa) were erupting tholeiite voluminously. The lower magma
   volumes for earlier time intervals reflect ramping up of volcanism at
   Hawaii as it waned on Maui Nui, and an interval of diminished magma
   supply along the Hawaiian Ridge as recorded by the inter-island
   channel. The lower volumes for younger intervals largely reflect
   existence of only a single volcano, Kilauea, with a recent magma supply
   of 0.1 km^3/yr or higher. For the other two highly active volcanoes,
   Loihi is transitioning from its waxing-alkalic stage while tholeiitic
   eruption rates have been declining at Mauna Loa, resulting in lower
   overall magma supply. Because Kilauea only entered its main-tholeiite
   stage at ca. 100 ka or more recently, magma volumes were lower for the
   preceding few hundred thousand years as tholeiite eruptions diminished
   at Kohala, Hualalai, Mauna Kea, and Mauna Loa.

   In comparison to the near-constant propagation plot (Table 10A; Fig.
   14A), the age-volume distribution of magma supply shifts to a slightly
   earlier peak time for near-constant volcano life spans (Table 10B),
   because these models lengthen eruptive duration and lower peak magma
   supply for volcanoes with small total volume. In contrast, models of
   higher tholeiite production and variable lifespan (Table 10C) shift
   peak magma supply to younger times, because the reduced life spans
   require younger inception ages and reduced durations of the
   main-tholeiite stage. The high volume at 400 ka in this model is
   dominated by Mauna Loa input, a result probably inconsistent with
   available ages as discussed earlier. Although the differences among the
   plots are relatively modest, they incorporate substantially different
   growth models for some volcanoes. For example, the inception age for
   Mauna Kea varies from 1100 to 750 ka, and duration of its
   main-tholeiite stage 650–300 k.y.; for Mauna Loa, 950–550 ka, and
   850–450 k.y., respectively (Table 3). These time-volume plots for
   composite assembly of the Hawaii construct thus broadly mirror, on
   different scales, the growth histories of the individual component
   volcanoes (Figs. 3A, 9–10, 12–13), and define an intense pulse of magma
   supply that has diminished during the last few hundred thousand years.

   The growth models for individual volcanoes can be adjusted to varying
   degrees without violating available age data and uncertainties in
   volume estimates, and multiple iterations were explored. However, no
   seemingly reasonable models produced substantial changes to the growth
   geometries plotted in Figure 14, and some adjustments lead to
   improbable models. For example, models that raise peak-tholeiite magma
   supply for smaller-volume volcanoes, closer to the current 0.1 km^3/yr
   rate for Kilauea and that modeled for large volcanoes like Kohala,
   reduce the time span for this stage and yield a narrow steep growth
   curve, rather than a broad plateau of sustained growth (e.g., Mauna
   Kea, Fig. 10C; Mauna Loa, Fig. 12C). Such abbreviated intervals of peak
   growth would likely require a hotspot magma source of much smaller
   magma-capture diameter than the 100–150 km inferred for the Hawaiian
   Ridge, based on duration of activity at individual volcanoes and
   distribution of concurrently active ones (Ribe and Christensen, 1999;
   Quane et al., 2000; DePaolo et al., 2001). A small hotspot locus would
   also make the sustained compositional contrast between the Kea and Loa
   trends (Weis et al., 2011) even more difficult to interpret, as well as
   the cause for eruptive loci along separate trends rather than a single
   one centralized over the propagation axis.

   Evidence for decline in the overall magma supply during the last few
   hundred thousand years seems robust unless the models for Mauna Loa
   were drastically in error. No obvious alternatives seem adequate. Even
   if Mauna Loa were much younger than the models preferred here or
   previously proposed (800–900 ka; Lipman, 1995; DePaolo et al., 2001),
   with inception as recent as 550 ka and thereby requiring very high
   tholeiite-stage magma supply (up to 0.5 km^3/yr; Table 8C; Fig. 12C),
   the island-wide magma-supply rate (at 300–500 ka) would still be about
   triple that since 200 ka (Table 10C; Fig. 14A). An even more
   speculative alternative might be the previously noted possibility that
   Ka Lae Ridge could be the distal south rift of Hualalai (Holcomb et
   al., 2000), thereby permitting eruptive decline at Mauna Loa to have
   begun as recently as 100 ka, rather than decreasing in growth at ca.
   400 ka as implied by age determinations at Ka Lae (Jicha et al., 2012).
   This interpretation, although seemingly inconsistent with gravity
   expression for the rift zones of these volcanoes (Kauahikaua et al.,
   2000), could lower peak magma production and broaden the time span for
   growth at Mauna Loa, especially if combined with a young inception age
   as in Figure 12C. Such a model would also reduce the total volume of
   Mauna Loa and greatly augment that of Hualalai, however, precluding
   large increase in total magma supply for the island in the interval
   400–100 ka. In this seemingly extreme model (not illustrated
   separately), the main-tholeiite stage during sustained growth of Mauna
   Loa would have been atypically brief (400–450 k.y.) compared to that
   documented for Kohala, and the island-wide magma supply would still
   have peaked at ca. 400 ka with a rate more than double that since 200
   ka.

   Magma-supply and eruption rates change by an order of magnitude or more
   at some individual volcanoes and between adjacent ones during the
   tholeiite stage, despite relatively uniform major-element melt
   compositions. These ranges suggest near-constant proportions of melting
   but large changes in source volume. Such source variations are likely
   recorded by more subtle trace-element and isotopic variations during
   tholeiitic growth (Frey and Rhodes, 1993; Rhodes and Hart, 1995;
   Pietruszka and Garcia, 1999; Marske et al., 2007; Weis et al., 2011).

DISCUSSION

   Major results from this summary include recognition that no
   one-size-fits-all growth model accounts for the diverse age, volume,
   composition, and magma-supply variations among Hawaiian volcanoes.
   Volumes of the older volcanoes that have nearly completed their growth
   (Table 2) vary by up to an order of magnitude (if Mahukona is a
   separate edifice), volcano spacing along the Kea and Loa trends by a
   factor of two (Tables 11C and 11D), and peak magma supply probably by a
   factor of five or more during the tholeiite stage that accounts for the
   bulk of each volcano. The growth models also show that the evolutionary
   stages during volcano growth are more varied than previously discussed,
   demonstrate inconsistencies with prior geodynamic models, indicate that
   composite volcanic growth at Hawaii peaked ca. 800–400 ka, and suggest
   that current island growth is at reduced rates.

   Variable durations of growth stages are well documented for the
   waning-alkalic stage on the older volcanoes: commonly a few hundred
   thousand years, but ranging from >950 k.y. at Haleakala to absent at
   Lanai (Moore and Clague, 1992; Sherrod et al., 2007). Much variability
   also seems likely for the earlier growth stages, for which age data are
   sparse. The waxing-alkalic stage is ∼50% longer at Kilauea than at
   Loihi. Modeling suggests that durations of tholeiitic activity were
   briefer at smaller-volume volcanoes like Mauna Kea than at larger ones
   such as Kohala (Table 3). As a result, the shifts between growth stages
   correlate inconsistently with propagation and inception rates estimated
   from volcano spacing and plate motion. For example, the tholeiite–late
   alkalic transition was nearly concurrent at ca. 330–350 ka for Kohala
   and Mauna Kea, 40 km distant. For Mauna Kea and Hualalai, the decline
   in morphologic shield growth (shoreline subsidence) was nearly
   concurrent at ca. 130 ka, while their tholeiite stages ended
   asynchronously at ca. 330 and ca. 120 ka, respectively.

   Interpretations that have modeled growth at near-constant values for
   total volcano lifespan, duration of growth stages, and propagation over
   a fixed hotspot, thus are difficult to reconcile in detail with even
   the limited age and volume data now available. The constant propagation
   rate and growth-stage duration model for Hawaii by Moore and Clague
   (1992) required propagation at 13 cm/yr (Fig. 3C) that is much faster
   than present-day or longer-duration Pacific plate motion (7–9 cm/yr),
   inception ages for Kohala and Mauna Loa that are younger than can be
   reconciled with recent ^40Ar/^39Ar dates, and duration of the
   main-tholeiite stage of only 500 k.y. that would require magma supply
   at the larger volcanoes to be much higher than at present-day Kilauea
   (five times as high for Mauna Loa; Table 8C). Geometric models for the
   varied size and duration of Hawaiian volcanoes in relation to location
   along the trace of the hotspot by DePaolo and Stolper (1996) led to
   inference of a 600 ka inception age for Kilauea, more than twice that
   implied by recent isotopic ages (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006). Their
   steady-state geometric model, which related volcano lifespan and size
   to varied distance from the axis of hotspot progression, also lacks an
   explanation for alternation of large and small volcanoes on both the
   Kea and Loa trends. The uniform growth curves (Fig. 3B) modeled by
   Holcomb et al. (2000) are incompatible with the order-of-magnitude
   variation in volume among the island’s volcanoes (Table 2).

   No single propagation rate works for the combined volcanoes of the two
   trends, either. The best-constrained rate for any of the Kea or Loa
   volcanoes is 8.6 cm/yr (Table 11; Fig. 15), calculated from
   time-distance relations for the waxing-alkalic and volcano-inception
   ages at Kilauea and Kohala (Calvert and Lanphere, 2006; Lipman and
   Calvert, 2011). In contrast, a propagation rate of 8.6 cm/yr from
   Kilauea yields an impossible future inception age for Loihi Seamount
   (-248 ka; Table 11A) and an implausibly young age for Mauna Loa (540
   ka; Table 11B), younger than some isotopic ages on main-stage tholeiite
   from the distal Ka Lae Ridge (Jicha et al., 2012). At the best estimate
   of inception age for Loihi (ca. 125 ka), the propagation rate from
   Kilauea would be an improbably rapid 30 cm/yr (Table 11B). If Loihi
   were older than 125 ka (e.g., 330–400 ka, as inferred by Garcia et al.
   [2006]), the divergence between trends would be even greater.

   Alternatively, a separate distance-inception age plot for Loa-trend
   volcanoes, both projected from Loihi inception at 125 ka and for
   individual volcano pairs, yields more rapid propagation rates of
   10.5–10.7 cm/yr (Table 11D; Fig. 15B). This rate produces offsets to
   earlier inception ages for the younger Loa-trend volcanoes, relative to
   distance along the Kea trend, that reduce or eliminate inconsistencies
   in age-distance plots for these two volcano groups (Fig. 15B). Most
   importantly, the model inception age for Mauna Loa becomes geologically
   more plausible (ca. 800 ka). Such an average Loa-trend rate (∼10.6
   cm/yr) would converge with the Kea trend on Maui Nui, yielding
   near-concurrent distances and ages for Haleakala and Kahoolawe.

   A semi-constant Loa-trend propagation rate (10.6 cm/yr) yields an
   inception age of 2250 ka (Table 11) and a sustained-tholeiite stage of
   ∼900 k.y. for Kahoolawe, consistent with the slightly younger age (by
   only 50 k.y.) estimated independently for Haleakala, based on the lower
   propagation rate for the Kea trend. These inception ages for volcanoes
   on Maui Nui may be somewhat old, generating durations of 900–1000 k.y.
   for their main-tholeiite stage (Table 11, models C–D), and suggesting
   that propagation rates across the Maui Channel may have been more
   rapid, perhaps ∼11 cm/yr for both trends. The combined average Kea and
   Loa propagation rates agree reasonably with a prior estimate of 9 cm/yr
   by DePaolo and Stolper (1996), but are lower than the 13 cm/yr
   suggested by Moore and Clague (1992). However, such comparisons are
   based on limited data: ages and volumes are less known for the older
   Loa-tend volcanoes, and interpretation of the Kohala terrace (Mahukona)
   is especially problematic.

   Inception ages and sites for new volcanoes along the Hawaiian Ridge,
   rather than following any simple geometric propagation, are likely
   nonlinear in detail, jumping ahead of the plate-motion progression or
   lagging behind in response to availability of favorable structures in
   the oceanic lithosphere or in adjacent volcanoes. Perhaps volcano
   inception can be triggered by controls other than just location
   relative to the melting zone. Some volcanoes could be conceived in the
   headwalls of slumps or slides on older volcanoes; Kilauea and Loihi
   both could have started this way. Complexities of the geometric models
   explored here may be indicating that other factors are involved in
   inception and growth of Hawaiian volcanoes. Although existing age data
   are inadequate to evaluate such alternatives, they demonstrate that
   volcano inception cannot be rigorously modeled based solely on motion
   of the Pacific plate. In addition, absolute southwestward motion of the
   hotspot at 4–5.5 cm/yr seems required by the divergence of direction
   and velocity for volcano propagation along the Kea and Loa trends on
   Hawaii (N35°W, 8.6–10.6 cm/yr) from the longer-term trend of the
   Hawaiian chain (N65°W, 9.6 cm/yr; Clague and Dalrymple, 1987) and from
   present GPS-measured motion of the Pacific plate (N65°W, ∼7 cm/yr;
   http://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/post/series.html). This hotspot motion
   thus would be about three-quarters as large as the plate motion,
   contributing significantly to the geometry of volcano propagation.
   Recent southwestward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot, also inferred from
   trends of isotopic and seismic data (DePaolo et al., 2001; Wright and
   Klein, 2006), could account for the change in trend of the Hawaiian
   Ridge at Maui Nui.

   The variable growth histories of individual volcanoes, divergent
   propagation rates along the Kea and Loa trends, discontinuous magma
   flux during assembly of Hawaii Island, and longer-term growth of the
   Hawaiian chain as discrete islands rather than a continuous ridge, may
   record strongly pulsed magma flow in the hotspot/plume source, similar
   to that recorded in tomographic images of the mantle beneath
   Yellowstone (Schmandt et al., 2012). For the growth of Hawaii, the
   magma pulse took ∼500–600 k.y. to reach maximum supply, then was
   sustained for ∼400 k.y. before diminishing steeply. Peak growth of
   Hawaii Island between ca. 400 and 800 ka was probably preceded by
   another period of high magma supply at ca. 1.5–2.0 Ma during composite
   growth of Maui Nui. Such episodic magma flux and island growth along
   the Hawaiian chain thus may constitute an intraoceanic analog to the
   intermittent recurrence of ignimbrite super-eruptions and attendant
   caldera formation along the Snake River–Yellowstone hotspot track
   (Pierce and Morgan, 2009).

   The conclusions presented here are largely based on sparse results from
   rocks that are challenging to date, while volume estimates remain
   poorly constrained because of limited control on dimensions of volcano
   onlap, the component of intrusive and cumulate bodies at depth below
   the associated volcano construct, and even uncertainty about the
   existence of Mahukona volcano. Inconsistent relations between location
   and inception age among the youngest volcanoes on Hawaii (Loihi,
   Kilauea, Mauna Loa), leading to interpreted offset between the Kea and
   Loa trends, suggest that comparable complexities probably characterize
   the older edifices for which early growth is even less constrained.
   Particularly needed are additional ages from early-alkalic basalts on
   other volcanoes, perhaps from submarine samples low along landslide
   scarps or distal rift zones, and controls on rate of main-stage
   tholeiite lava accumulation sampled from drill holes or submarine
   scarps. Much more could be learned from such additional sampling, along
   with efforts to improve capacity to determine reliable isotopic ages
   for low-K basalt (discussed further in Appendix A).

   This overview, initiated as an invited keynote talk at the 2012
   American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on Hawaiian Volcanoes,
   has roots in decades of interactions with colleagues too numerous to
   acknowledge, but especially including Dave Clague, Michelle Coombs, Don
   DePaolo, Mike Garcia, Jack Lockwood, Jim Moore, Bill Normark, Tom
   Sisson, Don Swanson, and Bob Tilling. Much appreciated are thoughtful
   comments on an early draft by Bob Tilling, Jim Moore, Tom Sisson, and
   Brian Jicha, and helpful reviews for the journal by Dennis Geist and
   Dave Clague.

APPENDIX A. GEOCHRONOLOGY

   Geochronology of Hawaiian lavas is extremely difficult due to modest K
   contents, difficult rock textures, and tropical weathering. Early
   results were often plagued by excess argon (implausibly old ages),
   negative or zero ages, and results that violated superposition. Recent
   studies using careful sample selection, preparation, and analytical
   techniques have obtained promising results. ^40Ar/^39Ar results from
   relatively high-K, crystalline-lava groundmass concentrates separated
   from submarine and borehole samples are reproducible, satisfy
   stratigraphic constraints, and appear reliable. Unspiked K-Ar samples
   using novel methods yield promising results, though occasionally in
   conflict with ^40Ar/^39Ar results. Tholeiitic lavas continue to yield
   little useable data, due to low potassium (K[2]O generally <0.4 wt%)
   and difficult textures, although Jicha et al. (2012) managed to produce
   14 reasonable ages from 41 candidate tholeiitic lavas. All known
   published ^40Ar/^39Ar and unspiked K-Ar results for the Island of
   Hawaii are compiled in Table A1, along with representative radiogenic
   argon yields and bulk-rock potassium contents.

   Armed with this improved chronologic framework and understanding of
   rock samples and analytical techniques necessary for reliable ages, we
   recommend several directions for future research:

   (1) Loihi samples dated by Guillou et al. (1997a) should be analyzed
   using ^40Ar/^39Ar incremental-heating techniques, such as employed in
   laboratories at the Berkeley Geochronology Center, University of
   Wisconsin, Oregon State University, and U.S. Geological Survey. This
   sample suite contains 0.6–1 wt% K[2]O and yielded reproducible but
   stratigraphically inconsistent ages. ^40Ar/^39Ar techniques may solve
   those issues.

   (2) Mauna Loa’s Ninole Hills have produced complicated K-Ar (Lipman et
   al., 1990) and ^40Ar/^39Ar results (Jicha et al., 2012) that suggest
   eruption at 100–200 ka. Further careful sample collection and analysis
   may yield more reliable results for these Mauna Loa units.

   (3) Subaerial transitional and alkalic rocks from Kohala (Pololu and
   Hawi Volcanics) should be analyzed using ^40Ar/^39Ar techniques.

   Finally, we encourage full disclosure of future Hawaii geochronologic
   work to help understand limitations of the techniques. It is tempting
   to publish only data that yield positive or stratigraphically
   consistent ages; however, Hawaiian rocks are unusually difficult to
   date and eventual success will require a collective effort. While
   discussing problematic samples often complicates and lengthens
   manuscripts, authors and editors are encouraged to present all data,
   not only those that yield satisfactory results.

APPENDIX B. ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF VOLCANOES

   The following tables (Tables B1–B6) summarize geometric assumptions and
   other approaches used to estimate volumes for the individual volcanoes
   on the Island of Hawaii. Most revisions involve adjustments for
   inferred sloping onlap contacts between edifices, while constrained by
   the estimated overall island volume of 213 × 10^3 km^3 (Robinson and
   Eakins, 2006). Uncertainties vary among volcanoes, but likely are about
   ±10% for most. Uncertainties are probably largest for the older
   volcanoes of the Loa trend.

   much of the more recent data summarized in this review. (B)
   Diagrammatic growth models for Hawaiian volcanoes (Holcomb et al.,

   Summary of alkalinity versus ages of Kilauea lavas, illustrating
   intermittent eruption of volumetrically minor transitional basalt
   during the sustained-tholeiite stage since >50 ka. Calculated
   alkalinity [(Na2O + K2O) – 0.37*(SiO2 – 39)] is defined as the weight
   percent difference in Na2O + K2O between the sample and the
   alkali/tholeiitic basalt line of MacDonald and Katsura (1964). Left
   column is the subaerial stratigraphic sequence of Kilauea (Wolfe and
   Morris, 1996a); more alkalic lavas in the upper right of the diagram
   are from the submarine south flank (italic labels). The strongly
   alkalic samples are clasts in debris-flow deposits from below the
   mid-slope bench (MSB, Fig. 1); weakly alkalic basalts are from
   prominent rib outcrops above the western side of the bench; and
   submarine transitional basalts form continuous exposures above the

   Modeled volcano propagation rates and inception ages, illustrating
   divergence between younger volcanoes of the Kea and Loa trends, Hawaii
   Island and Maui Nui. (A) Modeled volcano-inception ages versus distance
   from Kilauea (Kea and Loa trends plotted together; data from Table
   11B), illustrating divergence of Loihi from the best-fit trend anchored
   by dated rocks from Kilauea and Kohala. The propagation rate of 8.6
   cm/yr for the Kea trend is calculated from the time-distance relation
   for the dated volcano inception and the early-alkalic transition at
   Kilauea and Kohala (Tables 11A and 11C). For the Loa trend to converge
   with the better-constrained Kea trend, anchored by Kilauea inception at
   275 ka, Loihi activity should not begin until ∼250 k.y. in the future,
   and inception of Mauna Loa at ca. 540 ka would be younger than some
   dated tholeiite pillow lavas from Ka Lae Ridge (Jicha et al., 2012).
   Alternatively, an estimated 125 ka inception age for Loihi would
   require an implausibly rapid propagation rate (∼30 cm/yr) from Kilauea
   (Table 11B). Alternatively, if volcano inception is plotted separately
   along the Kea and Loa trends, the plots are linear but divergent (shown
   in B). (B) Modeled volcano-inception ages versus distance from Loihi
   (Kea and Loa trends plotted separately; data from Table 11C–D),
   illustrating divergence between younger volcanoes of the Kea and Loa
   trends, Hawaii and Maui Nui. The best-fit rate of 10.6 cm/yr for the
   Loa trend is based on an estimated 125 ka inception age for Loihi,
   projected to converge with near-concurrent distances and ages for
   Haleakala and Kahoolawe on Maui Nui (Table 11D). If Loihi commenced
   earlier (e.g., 330–400 ka, as proposed by Garcia et al. [2006]), the
   propagation from Kilauea would be negative (Loihi older than Kilauea),
   and the divergence between the two trends would become even greater.
   Major results from plotting the Loa trend separately are the more
   consistent propagation rate, both progressing from Loihi inception at
   125 ka and for individual volcano pairs, and the offset to an older
   inception age for Mauna Loa (ca. 800 ka) that is more geologically
   reasonable. Abbreviations: H—Hualalai; HA—Haleakala; KI—Kilauea;
