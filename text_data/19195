   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. Who is calling? Does this
   question ring a bell? It probably rings dozens of bells one by one all
   day long. Not only do unsolicited phone calls incorporate telemarketers
   and surveys, both of which have, despite their annoying nature, some
   sort of legitimacy, but also entertain various scam and spam calls who
   solely aim at squeazing profit from someone's misery. ir.tellows.net
   aims at the negation of the fraudsters most effectiv advantage – the
   people's ignorance. Through the accumulation of information on spam and
   scam phone numbers, tellows has commited itself to establish a vast
   database providing the above mentioned information on dubious and
   dangerous phone numbers for free. Therewith, our users a able to
   identify the call's nature before answering the phone. In addition, an
   approximate location of the call's origin is displayed.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   Unfortunately, the details on spam and scam number do not entertain the
   habit of growing on trees. Therefore, tellows needs you!!!. Share your
   knowledge with the tellows community by publishing comments on dubious
   numbers and rating them on a scale from 1 (safe) to 9 (extremely
   dangerous). From this input the tellows-score is generated via a
   complex algorithm in order to show the user whether the caller is
   trustworthy or not. Your willingness to share knowledge and, therewith,
   your participation in the battle against fraudulant entrepreneurs will
   be a vital component to effectively warn your fellow countrymen of
   potential dangers to the their purses.
