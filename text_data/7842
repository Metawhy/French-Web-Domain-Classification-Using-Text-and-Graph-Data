   Very fast and easy to get started 4/14/2019 2:05:28 AM

   Pros: - Super powerful computer considering the form factor. If you
   dream of painting reality with AR layers, this is the type of node you
   would need!
   - m.2 for wifi adaptor
   - Accelerated edge training possible & cluster training

   Cons: - No built in wifi
   - Not sure on the GPIO yet, still testing
   - Power hungry

   Overall Review: I thought about plugging in a usb Coral edge TPU for a
   mobile super computer but they use different versions of TensorFlow. I
   don't think training at the edge and using a tpu is possible yet. But
   this thing is bananas, probably one of the first computers capable of
   some autonomy. Trying to get mine to plug itself in, need a different
   battery though.

   Easy Setup process, Decent Performance, but one was DOA 4/11/2019
   7:58:04 AM

   Pros: - Good performance for a simple SoM board.
   - Decent expandability with peripherals

   Cons: - One DOA board out of the two I ordered
   - No on-board WiFi (but you should know this before you buy!)
   - Still relatively new, so some software may have limited support (no
   real info on forums for things like Tensorflow, CUDA, etc.)
   - No resources like whats available for the TX2 or Xavier (SoM pinouts,
   design guidelines, etc.)

   Overall Review: - Sill definitely worth the price. Don't expect to
   train on here, but executing models and some object detection should be
   do-able.
