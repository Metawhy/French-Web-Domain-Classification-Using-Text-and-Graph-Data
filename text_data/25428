Mersenne Prime Number discovery - 2^82589933-1 is Prime!

   Back to list of Mersenne Prime Numbers

                               GIMPS Discovers
                 Largest Known Prime Number: 2^82,589,933-1

   BLOWING ROCK, NC, December 21, 2018 -- The Great Internet Mersenne
   Prime Search (GIMPS) has discovered the largest known prime number,
   2^82,589,933-1, having 24,862,048 digits. A computer volunteered by
   Patrick Laroche made the find on December 7, 2018. Patrick is one of
   thousands of volunteers using free GIMPS software available at
   www.mersenne.org/download/.

   The new prime number, also known as M82589933, is calculated by
   multiplying together 82,589,933 twos, and then subtracting one. It is
   more than one and a half million digits larger than the previous record
   prime number, in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known
   as Mersenne primes. It is only the 51st known Mersenne prime ever
   discovered, each increasingly more difficult to find. Mersenne primes
   were named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these
   numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996, has discovered
   the last 17 Mersenne primes. Volunteers download a free program to
   search for these primes, with a cash award offered to anyone lucky
   enough to find a new prime. Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an
   authoritative web site on the largest known primes, and has an
   excellent history of Mersenne primes.

   A Lucky Find in a Lucky Streak

   Patrick Laroche is a 35 year old I.T. professional living in Ocala,
   Florida. For many years, Patrick had used GIMPS software as a free
   "stress test" for his computer builds. Recently, he started prime
   hunting on his media server to "give back" to the project. After less
   than 4 months and on just his fourth try, he discovered the new prime
   number. By way of comparison, some GIMPS participants have searched for
   more than 20 years with tens of thousands of attempts but no success.
   Thus proving that even the "little guy" can compete against those with
   lots of computing resources.

   GIMPS has also been extremely lucky over the last 15 years. This is
   GIMPS' 12th prime discovery between 2^20000000-1 and 2^85000000-1,
   triple the expected number of new primes. One reason to search for new
   primes is to match actual results with expected results. This anomaly
   is not necessarily evidence that existing theories on the distribution
   of Mersenne primes is incorrect. However, if the trend continues it may
   be worth further investigation.

   Details on the Discovery and Verification

   The primality proof took twelve days of non-stop computing on a machine
   with an Intel i5-4590T CPU. To prove there were no errors in the prime
   discovery process, the new prime was independently verified using three
   different programs on three different hardware configurations.
     * Andreas Höglund verified the prime using CUDALucas running on a
       NVidia V100 GPU in 21 hours.
     * Andreas Höglund also verified the prime using Mlucas running on 16
       cores of an Amazon AWS instance in 72 hours.
     * Aaron Blosser also verified it using Prime95 on an Intel 7700K
       processor in 6 days, 8 hours.

   GIMPS Prime95 client software was developed by founder George Woltman.
   Aaron Blosser is the system administrator, upgrading and maintaining
   the PrimeNet server as needed. Volunteers have a chance to earn
   research discovery awards of $3,000 or $50,000 if their computer
   discovers a new Mersenne prime. GIMPS' next major goal is to win the
   $150,000 award administered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation
   offered for finding a 100 million digit prime number.

   Credit for this prime goes not only to Patrick Laroche for running the
   Prime95 software, Woltman for writing the software, Blosser for
   maintaining the Primenet server, but also the thousands of GIMPS
   volunteers that sifted through millions of non-prime candidates.  In
   recognition of all the above people, official credit for this discovery
   goes to "P. Laroche, G. Woltman, A. Blosser, et al."

   Patrick's find is eligible for the $3,000 GIMPS research discovery
   award.

   About Mersenne.org's Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search

   The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was formed in January
   1996 by George Woltman to discover new world record size Mersenne
   primes. In 1997 Scott Kurowski enabled GIMPS to automatically harness
   the power of thousands of ordinary computers to search for these
   "needles in a haystack". Most GIMPS members join the search for the
   thrill of possibly discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new
   Mersenne prime. The search for more Mersenne primes is already under
   way. There may be smaller, as yet undiscovered Mersenne primes, and
   there almost certainly are larger Mersenne primes waiting to be found.
   Anyone with a reasonably powerful PC can join GIMPS and become a big
   prime hunter, and possibly earn a cash research discovery award. All
   the necessary software can be downloaded for free at
   www.mersenne.org/download/. GIMPS is organized as Mersenne Research,
   Inc., a 501(c)(3) science research charity. Additional information may
   be found at www.mersenneforum.org and www.mersenne.org; donations are
   welcome.

   For More Information on Mersenne Primes

   Prime numbers have long fascinated both amateur and professional
   mathematicians. An integer greater than one is called a prime number if
   its only divisors are one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3,
   5, 7, 11, etc. For example, the number 10 is not prime because it is
   divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form
   2^P-1. The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, and 127 corresponding to
   P = 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively. There are now 51 known Mersenne
   primes.

   Mersenne primes have been central to number theory since they were
   first discussed by Euclid about 350 BC. The man whose name they now
   bear, the French monk Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), made a famous
   conjecture on which values of P would yield a prime. It took 300 years
   and several important discoveries in mathematics to settle his
   conjecture.

   At present there are few practical uses for this new large prime,
   prompting some to ask "why search for these large primes"? Those same
   doubts existed a few decades ago until important cryptography
   algorithms were developed based on prime numbers. For seven more good
   reasons to search for large prime numbers, see here.

   Previous GIMPS discoveries

   Previous GIMPS Mersenne prime discoveries were made by members in
   various countries.
      In December 2017, Jonathan Pace et al. discovered the 50th known
   Mersenne prime in the U.S.
      In January 2016, Curtis Cooper et al. discovered the 49th known
   Mersenne prime in the U.S.

   Mersenne prime in Germany.
      In May 2004, Josh Findley et al. discovered the 41st known Mersenne
   prime in the U.S.
      In November 2003, Michael Shafer et al. discovered the 40th known
   Mersenne prime in the U.S.
      In November 2001, Michael Cameron et al. discovered the 39th
   Mersenne prime in Canada.
      In June 1999, Nayan Hajratwala et al. discovered the 38th Mersenne
   prime in the U.S.
      In January 1998, Roland Clarkson et al. discovered the 37th Mersenne
   prime in the U.S.
      In August 1997, Gordon Spence et al. discovered the 36th Mersenne
   prime in the U.K.
      In November 1996, Joel Armengaud et al. discovered the 35th Mersenne
   prime in France.

   Euclid proved that every Mersenne prime generates a perfect number. A
   perfect number is one whose proper divisors add up to the number
   itself. The smallest perfect number is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 and the second
   perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. Euler (1707-1783) proved
   that all even perfect numbers come from Mersenne primes. The newly
   discovered perfect number is 2^82,589,932 x (2^82,589,933-1). This
   number is over 49 million digits long! It is still unknown if any odd
   perfect numbers exist.

   There is a unique history to the arithmetic algorithms underlying the
   GIMPS project. The programs that found the recent big Mersenne primes
   are based on a special algorithm. In the early 1990's, the late Richard
   Crandall, Apple Distinguished Scientist, discovered ways to double the
   speed of what are called convolutions -- essentially big multiplication
   operations. The method is applicable not only to prime searching but
   other aspects of computation. During that work he also patented the
   Fast Elliptic Encryption system, now owned by Apple Computer, which
   uses Mersenne primes to quickly encrypt and decrypt messages. George
   Woltman implemented Crandall's algorithm in assembly language, thereby
   producing a prime-search program of unprecedented efficiency, and that
   work led to the successful GIMPS project.

   School teachers from elementary through high-school grades have used
   GIMPS to get their students excited about mathematics. Students who run
   the free software are contributing to mathematical research.

                            GIMPS 2019 fundraiser

   GIMPS is a victim of its own success! In 2008, after claiming the EFF
   award for discovery of the first 10 million digit prime, GIMPS had
   about $25,000 cash on hand to fund the server hardware, ISP fees, and
   $3000 awards for discovery of new Mersenne primes. Due to the
   unexpected, but welcome, discovery of 6 new Mersenne primes since 2008,
   GIMPS now has enough cash to fund just two years of ISP fees (much less
   if a new Mersenne prime is discovered).

   GIMPS needs your help! For the first time in our 23 year history we are
   conducting a fundraiser. Our goal is to raise $5000 or more in 2019 to
   build a better cushion for upcoming ISP expenses and cover the next
   prime discovery award. Please consider making a donation so GIMPS can
   continue its quest to discover ever larger Mersenne primes for years to
   come.

   GIMPS has set up a new subforum where the board of directors will keep
   our users well informed of its decisions, past and present finances,
   and fundraising progress.

                      51st Known Mersenne Prime Found!

   December 21, 2018 — The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)
   has discovered the largest known prime number, 2^82,589,933-1, having
   24,862,048 digits. A computer volunteered by Patrick Laroche from
   Ocala, Florida made the find on December 7, 2018. The new prime number,
   also known as M82589933, is calculated by multiplying together
   82,589,933 twos and then subtracting one. It is more than one and a
   half million digits larger than the previous record prime number.

   GIMPS has been on amazing lucky streak finding triple the expected
   number of new Mersenne primes -- a dozen in the last fifteen years.
   This prime was even luckier for Patrick Laroche, striking pay dirt on
   just his fourth try. For years, Patrick had used GIMPS software as a
   free "stress test" for his computer builds. Less than four months ago
   he started prime hunting on his media server to give back to the
   project. By way of comparison, some GIMPS participants have searched
   for more than 20 years with tens of thousands of attempts but no
   success. This proves that, with luck, anyone can find the next new
   Mersenne prime.

   The new prime is only the 51st known Mersenne prime ever discovered.
   Mersenne primes were named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who
   studied these numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996,
   has discovered the last 17 Mersenne primes. Volunteers download a free
   program to search for these primes, with a cash award offered to anyone
   lucky enough to find a new prime. Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an
   authoritative web site on the largest known primes, and has an
   excellent history of Mersenne primes.

   Patrick is one of thousands of volunteers using free GIMPS software
   available at www.mersenne.org/download/. Credit for this prime goes not
   only to Patrick Laroche for running the Prime95 software, Woltman for
   writing the software, Blosser for keeping the Primenet server running
   smoothly, and the thousands of GIMPS volunteers that sifted through
   millions of non-prime candidates.  In recognition of all the above
   people, official credit for this discovery goes to "P. Laroche, G.
   Woltman, A. Blosser, et al."

   You can read a little more in the press release.

  All tests smaller than M(43112609) have been verified, officially making it
  the 47th Mersenne Prime

   April 8, 2018 — Nearly 9 years ago in August 2008, M(43112609) was
   discovered, and now GIMPS has finished verification testing on every
   smaller Mersenne number. With no smaller primes found, M(43112609) is
   officially the 47th Mersenne prime.

   At the time of the discovery, M(43112609) was actually the 45th known
   Mersenne prime because M(37156667) wasn't discovered until 2 weeks
   later, and M(42643801) was found nearly a year later in June of 2009!
   The last time a Mersenne prime was discovered out of order was in 1988
   when M(110503) was found over 4 years after M(132049), and in 1961
   M(4423) was discovered mere seconds before M(4253) because of the order
   in which the printout was read.

   This highlights the importance of waiting until all smaller exponents
   have been tested and verified before we can say definitively where any
   Mersenne prime is ranked. Due to the distributed nature of the project
   as a whole, numbers are not always tested in order and a smaller
   Mersenne prime may yet be found. For that reason, thanks to all the
   GIMPS members that contributed their resources towards achieving this
   milestone. Join now to help GIMPS press onward with verification tests
   to prove M(57885161) is the 48th Mersenne prime!

  All tests smaller than M(42643801) have been verified, officially making it
  the 46th Mersenne Prime

   February 22, 2018 — Nearly 9 years ago in June 2009, M(42643801) was
   discovered, and now GIMPS has finished verification testing on every
   smaller Mersenne number. With no smaller primes found, M(42643801) is
   officially the 46th Mersenne prime. Thanks to all the GIMPS members
   that contributed their resources towards achieving this milestone. Join
   now to help GIMPS press onward with verification tests to prove
   M(43112609) is the 47th Mersenne prime.

   Verification tests are an important part of the GIMPS project. Errors
   can occur during a test of smaller numbers, invalidating the end
   result. Only by doing a double-check with matching results are we able
   to say for sure that a Mersenne number is composite. Until all numbers
   below a Mersenne prime have been verified, we don't know for sure if
   it's the 46th known Mersenne prime or if there might be a smaller one
   that we missed due to a machine error, so we at GIMPS celebrate these
   important verification milestones.

                      50th Known Mersenne Prime Found!

   January 3, 2018 — Persistence pays off. Jonathan Pace, a GIMPS
   volunteer for over 14 years, discovered the 50th known Mersenne prime,
   2^77,232,917-1 on December 26, 2017. The prime number is calculated by
   multiplying together 77,232,917 twos, and then subtracting one. It
   weighs in at 23,249,425 digits, becoming the largest prime number known
   to mankind. It bests the previous record prime, also discovered by
   GIMPS, by 910,807 digits.

   Just how big is a 23,249,425 digit number? It's huge!! Big enough to
   fill an entire shelf of books totalling 9,000 pages! If every second
   you were to write five digits to an inch then 54 days later you'd have
   a number stretching over 73 miles (118 km) -- almost 3 miles (5 km)
   longer than the previous record prime.

   Jonathan Pace is a 51 year old Electrical Engineer living in Germantown
   Tennessee. He is a long-time math enthusiast now working at FedEx and
   active in community charities. As SysAdmin for his charities, he runs
   Prime95 on all PCs and servers because GIMPS emails him if one doesn't
   check in, which is helpful for monitoring these remote computers from
   home or work. The PC that found the new prime took six days of intense
   computation on a quad-core Intel i5-6600 CPU to prove the number prime.

   To be thorough, the prime number was independently verified with four
   different programs running on various hardware configurations.

   In recognition of the individual discoverer, the software authors, the
   GIMPS project leaders, and every GIMPS participant's contribution,
   credit for the new prime goes to "Jonathan Pace, George Woltman, Scott
   Kurowski, Aaron Blosser, et al.".

   Could you be the next lucky volunteer to discover a brand new Mersenne
   Prime? You'll need a reasonably modern PC and the free software on the
   download page.

49th Known Mersenne Prime Found!

   January 7, 2016 — GIMPS celebrated its 20th anniversary with the
   discovery of the largest known prime number, 2^74,207,281-1. Curtis
   Cooper, one of many thousands of GIMPS volunteers, used one of his
   university's computers to make the find. The prime number, also known
   as M74207281, is calculated by multiplying together 74,207,281 twos
   then subtracting one. It has 22,338,618 digits -- almost 5 million
   digits longer than the previous record prime number.

   Dr. Cooper is a professor at the University of Central Missouri. This
   is the fourth record prime for Dr. Cooper and his university. The
   primality proof took a month of computing on a PC with an Intel I7-4790
   CPU.  Dr. Cooper and the University of Central Missouri is the largest
   contributor of CPU time to the GIMPS project. The discovery is eligible
   for a $3,000 GIMPS research discovery award.

  New Assignment and Recycling Rules

   February 2014 — Since 2008, GIMPS has given users one year to complete
   assignments. This rule has not been enforced. This has held up
   completing milestones as some assignments did not complete even after
   several years.

   During February 2014, new assignment and recycling policies were put in
   place to help GIMPS make steady progress on milestones by detecting
   assignments that are proceeding extremely slowly or not at all.

   This affects users in two ways:
     * When they occasionally become available, if you want to test the
       smallest exponents you'll need to sign up on the assignment rules
       page and be aware of the shorter timeline for returning results.
     * Your computers that are proven producers will have 8 or 9 months to
       complete assignments. Your slower computers and computers with a
       limited track record will still have a full year to complete their
       assignments.

   Users testing 100 million digit numbers are not affected by these new
   rules. Assignments made prior to March 1, 2014 will be given a year, as
   promised, to complete (plus a grace period if the assignment is close
   to complete).

  Make Math History!!

   You could discover one of the most coveted finds in all of Mathematics
   - a new Mersenne prime number. We've found fifteen already. Join in on
   this fun, yet serious research project. All you need is a personal
   computer, patience, and a lot of luck.

   In addition to the joy of making a mathematical discovery, you could
   win a (USD) $3,000 cash GIMPS Research Discovery Award for each
   Mersenne prime discovered, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation is
   offering a $150,000 award to the first person or group to discover a
   100 million digit prime number! See how GIMPS will distribute this
   award if we are lucky enough to find the winning 100 million digit
   prime.

  What are Mersenne primes and why do we search for them?

   Prime numbers have long fascinated amateur and professional
   mathematicians. An integer greater than one is called a prime number if
   its only divisors are one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3,
   5, 7, 11, etc. For example, the number 10 is not prime because it is
   divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime is a prime of the form 2^P-1.
   The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127 (corresponding to P = 2, 3,
   5, 7). There are only 49 known Mersenne primes.

   GIMPS, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, was formed in January
   1996 to discover new world-record-size Mersenne primes. GIMPS harnesses
   the power of thousands of small computers like yours to search for
   these "needles in a haystack".

   Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill of possibly
   discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new Mersenne prime. Of
   course, there are many other reasons.
