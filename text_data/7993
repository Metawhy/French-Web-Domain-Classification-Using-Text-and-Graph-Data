Answers to Questions

How to find the postal code of a French city?

   The post code (ZIP code) in France is a 5-digit number (with leading
   zeros if needed). It was set up by La Poste in 1964 for cities with a
   post office for mail delivery.

   The French postal code consists of 5 digits, the first 2 digits
   correspond to the department number (or the first 2 digits of the
   number for 3-digit numbers departments) and the other 3 digits are a
   code given by LaPoste. Some cities have several postal codes and some
   zip codes have multiple cities.

   Dcode can retrieve postal code from the name of a city, but also
   retrieve a city from its postal code.

   Example: 02468 returns to the city Marle

What the INSEE code for a French city?

   The INSEE code is a unique code that identifies French municipalities.
   (While many cities may have the same postal code, each city has only
   one INSEE code)

   Example: Caen has the INSEE code 14118

Answers to Questions

How to speak with an African accent?

   ! This page is a work in progression for English language. Feel free to
   share for improvements.

   To know how to make an African accent, first define the precise origin
   of the accent. Depending on African dialects, accents are not all the
   same, Africa is a large continent with a high diversity and North
   Africans do not have the same accent as South Africans, especially due
   the fact that their mother tongue is different (French, English, etc.)

   Example: African may be pronounced Afwican

   This page is not intended to stigmatize or make fun of African or their
   accent, but more to render with humor the phonology of African accent
   and simplify its imitation.

What is African American Vernacular English?

   Vernacular English is the name given to the accent of Afro-Americans.

How to listen to the voice or sound?

   dCode does not propose an audio conversion of the African accent but an
   idea of its African pronunciation in writing. To listen to an African
   text, use Google Translate: (link)

Answers to Questions

How to speak with a british accent?

   There are minors differences between american English and british
   English. Most of them are in stress pronunciation and cannot be shown
   within dCode.

   There are minor details with word ending with -ile that are pronunced
   -ayl in british English but -el in american English, same for -ation
   etc.

   Also the letter A can be different in some words such as class, chance,
   after, etc. Same for the sound r that is stronger in American English
   in hard, more, bar.

Answers to Questions

How to speak with a german accent?

   German accent can be obtained by making sounds from the back of the
   throat (guttural sounds), and replacing sounds T by D, J by CH, S by Z,
   G by K (and conversely). The use of H aspirated before certain vowels
   is also characteristic. The German accent in writing can be
   restranscribed in the manner of dCode.

   Example: dCode is ein great zite! Jawohl!

   In Germany, phonology has many bass sounds and hard consonants. The
   pronunciation of this language is very guttural which facilitates
   imitation of the teutonic accent.

   The German accent is generally used in movies about World War 2, it is
   accompanied by interjections like Ja, or Arheu, and the use of
   determinants as der or das.

What are the different german accents?

   There are three major types of German accents, the first is the
   Standard German, the second is derived from Austrian German, and the
   last from Swiss German.

How to listen to the voice or sound?

   dCode does not propose an audio conversion of the German accent but an

Answers to Questions

How to speak with an italian accent?

   ! This page is not perfect in English yet. Feel free to share for
   improvements.

   To know how to make an italian accent, first, remove the TH sound from
   your prononciation, TH is sometimes pronounced D or T. In the same way,
   H never have any sound.

   The vowel i is pronounced as an e in English.

   Example: italian may be pronunced eatalian

   To make the whole more credible, there are details to add as moving
   your hands or talking fast.

   Italians often use the negative interrogative form, adding no? to the
   end of a question.

   This fake italian accent tool is not intended to stigmatize or make fun
   of Italian or their accent, but approximate the phonology of Italian
   accent and simplify its imitation.

How to get a fake Sicilian accent?

   The Sicilian accent is identical to the Italian accent, but it is more
   accentuated, as in all the south of Italy. References to the movie 'the
   godfather' can be useful.

How to listen to the voice or sound?

   dCode does not propose an audio conversion of the Italian accent but an
