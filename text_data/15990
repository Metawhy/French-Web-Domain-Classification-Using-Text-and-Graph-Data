A Sesquicentennial Celebration

   May 7, 2019

   NMWA _1_TRANS

   Tuesday, May 7, 2019

   The National Museum of Wildlife Art has the largest collection in the
   United States of work and artifacts by Carl Rungius, who is widely
   regarded as the greatest portrayer of North American big game animals
   ever. The Museum has the world’s only known complete set of Rungius’s
   46 limited-edition engravings. To showcase the depth and diversity of
   its Rungius collection and to celebrate the 150^th anniversary of
   Rungius’s birth (he was born in Germany in 1869), the Museum has
   curated two Rungius Sesquicentennial exhibitions: Rungius Reunited &
   Rarely Seen Rungius. Both exhibits opened May 4 and Rarely Seen Rungius
   includes pieces too fragile to be on long-term display.

   “The work of Carl Rungius is incredibly important to our Museum, and
   the 150^th anniversary of his birth is a great way to celebrate and
   bring recognition to this master of wildlife art,” says Dr. Adam
   Harris, the Museum’s Joffa Kerr Chief Curator of Art and a recipient of
   the Governor’s Arts Award, which recognizes substantial contributions
   made in Wyoming that exemplify a long-term commitment to the arts.

   Rungius Reunited is the first time eight large paintings Rungius
   painted for the New York Zoological Society have been shown together
   since 1992. Between the 1955 and 1992, the eight paintings, then owned
   by the Rockefeller family, hung together at Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand
   Teton National Park. In 1994 the Rockefellers lent the eight paintings
   to two Wyoming museums: Cody’s Buffalo Bill Center of the West and the
   National Museum of Wildlife Art; each got four. The works were then
   gifted to the Museums in 1994. “For a curator, being able to reunite a
   group of paintings like this is really fun,” Harris says. “I think
   visitors will not only enjoy the display, but will also enjoy the story
   of how these paintings made their way from the Bronx to Jackson Lake
   Lodge to here.”

   For Rarely Seen Rungius, the Museum pulled artworks and archival
   materials from its collection of 645 catalogued Rungius items including
   fragile photographs, letters, and artifacts and a newly donated Rungius
   painting of an African lion, Sultan. Also on display will be Old
   Baldface, a painting Rungius did of a grizzly bear in 1935, a sketch
   Rungius did of the painting, and an engraving of the same design.
   Harris says, “It is not often you get to see all of these works
   together in one place. It gives you a special insight into the artist’s
   methods that only comes with viewing these works firsthand.”

   The Museum credits its founders Bill & Joffa Kerr for the excellence
   and depth of its collection of Rungius works and artifacts, especially
   the artist’s engravings. When it opened in 1987, exhibiting artworks
   mostly from the Kerrs’ collection, the Museum had copies of most of
   Rungius’s 46 engravings, although it did not have the rarest, In
   Fighting Mood. In 1994, when the Museum moved to its current location
   north of Jackson, Museum Trustees presented the Kerrs with the missing
   engraving for the Museum. (In Fighting Mood is included in Rarely Seen
   Rungius.) “It would take a long, long time and a lot of resources to
   duplicate what we have here—if it could even be done,” says Harris
   about the Museum’s Rungius collection.

   Carl Rungius was born and raised in Berlin, Germany, and came to
   America in 1894 at age 25 with his uncle; the two hunted moose in
   Maine. The following year Rungius traveled to Wyoming for the first
   time—he stayed at the Box R dude ranch on the western flanks of the
   Wind River Mountains—and that was the start of a lifelong love for the
   Rocky Mountains. Every summer thereafter until his death in 1959 he
   traveled to the Rocky Mountains to hunt and paint.

   The National Museum of Wildlife Art wishes to thank the Buffalo Bill
   Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming, for generously lending its major
   Rungius paintings for display in Rungius Reunited.

   through October 13.

   Rungius Sesquicentennial – Rungius Reunited & Rarely Seen Rungius is
   generously sponsored by: Elizabeth & Thomas Grainger, Gloria & Bill
   Newton, Anne & Michael Moran, and Tally & Bill Mingst.

   The National Museum of Wildlife Art, a nonprofit founded in 1987, is a
   world-class art museum holding more than 5,000 artworks representing
   wild animals from around the world. Featuring work by prominent artists
   such as Georgia O’Keeffe, Andy Warhol, Robert Kuhn, John James Audubon,
   and Carl Rungius, the Museum’s unsurpassed permanent collection
   chronicles much of the history of wildlife in art, from 2500 B.C. to
   the present. Built into a hillside overlooking the National Elk Refuge,
   the Museum received the designation “National Museum of Wildlife Art of
   the United States” by order of Congress in 2008. Boasting a Museum
   shop, interactive children’s gallery, Palate restaurant, and outdoor
   sculpture trail, the Museum is only two-and-a-half miles north of
   Jackson Town Square, and two miles from the gateway of Grand Teton
   National Park. www.WildlifeArt.org
