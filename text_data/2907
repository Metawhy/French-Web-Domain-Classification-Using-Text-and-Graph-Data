Logan Paul exploits car crash for vlog views, proves he's learned nothing

   You'd think maybe Logan Paul learned his lesson the last time he
   exploited a person for views. Nope.

   The disgraced vlogger now infamous for filming the body of a man who
   died by suicide and including it in his vlog has been spending his
   birthday week disturbing the peace at Yosemite National Park. In
   addition to receiving multiple citations from park rangers, Paul also
   filmed the aftermath of a car crash. Then he uploaded it to his vlog,
   teasing it at the front of the clip for views.

   At about 7 minutes into the vlog, Paul exits a river after falling out
   of a kayak when he hears a loud crash. He runs to the scene of the
   crash where it appears that a pickup truck t-boned a cargo van filled
   with people.

   "Are you guys OK?" Paul and his friend Andy Altig ask a man struggling
   to open the door of the van. A young child can be heard saying "ow"
   over and over again. The two check and make sure help has been called,
   confirming no one is seriously injured before returning to the river to
   retrieve their kayak.

   "Yo, what the fuck?" Paul asks Altig.

   "Yo, this is crazy," Altig responds, giggling to himself. The gang then
   retrieve their kayak, and later return to check on the families.

   This is in no way as bad as what Paul did when he filmed a dead body,
   but this is not a good look for someone who's trying to save face.
   Logan Paul exploited a shocked family with children that were just
   involved in a car crash for views. He didn't even have the decency to
   blur out their faces.

   Yes, I'm sure he was genuinely concerned for their wellbeing. Deep
   down, I don't believe that Logan Paul is a bad person with ill
   intentions, but not everything captured on camera needs to go in a
   vlog. Paul still hasn't learned that.

   After disappearing for less than a month following the suicide video
   controversy, Paul returned stating he was "starting a new chapter" in
   his life. But shortly after returning YouTube cut ad revenue on his
   channel after one of his vlogs featured him tasering a dead rat and
   taking a fish out of water to give it CPR.

   "We believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that
   makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers but also
   potentially damaging to the broader creator community," a spokesperson
   for YouTube said at the time.

   His ad revenue has since been restored, though at the time he remained
   on "probation" by YouTube.

The Most Popular Branded Boards on Pinterest

   Although the vast majority of brand engagement on Pinterest is
   user-generated, many branded accounts have achieved an impressive reach
   of their own.

   Social media-benchmarking company Unmetric took a look at 5,000 branded
   Pinterest boards in mid-March to assess which boards generated the most
   engagement in terms of followers, comments, likes and repins.
   Unsurprisingly, the most popular branded boards tend to fall in
   categories that are already popular among Pinterest's predominantly
   female userbase â namely food, fashion, home and weddings.

   The standout brand in the study is Better Homes and Gardens, whose
   "Blogger Faves From BHG.com" â a group board managed by 10 guest
   pinners â merited the second most repins, the third most likes and the
   fourth greatest number of comments among branded boards. Its "Blogger
   Recipes We Love," another group board with 15 contributors, ranked in
   the top three for repins and likes. Those collaborators are no doubt
   partly responsible for the boards' popularity, as new pins are shared
   not only with Better Homes and Gardens' followers, but also guest
   pinners' followers.

   Giveaway contests are one way to get a lot of comments on a branded
   board. Three of the top five boards in the category â Purex's "Purex
   Promotions," HTC Mobile's "HTC One by Cushnie et Ochs Giveaway" and
   Sephora's "Holiday: 40 Days of Wishes" â asked followers for comments
   in exchange for free prizes. This strategy doesn't necessarily produce
   high-quality comments, however; the majority of comments on HTC's
   giveaway board contain only links to users' repins, for example.

   Here's a breakdown of the most popular branded boards:

Logan Paul exploits car crash for vlog views, proves he's learned nothing

   You'd think maybe Logan Paul learned his lesson the last time he
   exploited a person for views. Nope.

   The disgraced vlogger now infamous for filming the body of a man who
   died by suicide and including it in his vlog has been spending his
   birthday week disturbing the peace at Yosemite National Park. In
   addition to receiving multiple citations from park rangers, Paul also
   filmed the aftermath of a car crash. Then he uploaded it to his vlog,
   teasing it at the front of the clip for views.

   match

   At about 7 minutes into the vlog, Paul exits a river after falling out
   of a kayak when he hears a loud crash. He runs to the scene of the
   crash where it appears that a pickup truck t-boned a cargo van filled
   with people.

   "Are you guys OK?" Paul and his friend Andy Altig ask a man struggling
   to open the door of the van. A young child can be heard saying "ow"
   over and over again. The two check and make sure help has been called,
   confirming no one is seriously injured before returning to the river to
   retrieve their kayak.

   "Yo, what the fuck?" Paul asks Altig.

   "Yo, this is crazy," Altig responds, giggling to himself. The gang then
   retrieve their kayak, and later return to check on the families.

   This is in no way as bad as what Paul did when he filmed a dead body,
   but this is not a good look for someone who's trying to save face.
   Logan Paul exploited a shocked family with children that were just
   involved in a car crash for views. He didn't even have the decency to
   blur out their faces.

   Yes, I'm sure he was genuinely concerned for their wellbeing. Deep
   down, I don't believe that Logan Paul is a bad person with ill
   intentions, but not everything captured on camera needs to go in a
   vlog. Paul still hasn't learned that.

   After disappearing for less than a month following the suicide video
   controversy, Paul returned stating he was "starting a new chapter" in
   his life. But shortly after returning YouTube cut ad revenue on his
   channel after one of his vlogs featured him tasering a dead rat and
   taking a fish out of water to give it CPR.

   "We believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that
   makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers but also
   potentially damaging to the broader creator community," a spokesperson
   for YouTube said at the time.

   His ad revenue has since been restored, though at the time he remained
   on "probation" by YouTube.

   Dead whales, stranded and decaying on beaches, can sometimes be
   weighed. But weighing a live whale is nearly impossible.

   Until now.

   Marine scientists have developed an innovative way to accurately
   estimate the heft of free-living whales by using drones to capture
   aerial footage of cetacean bodies. Scientists published the research
   Wednesday in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

   Knowing the weight of whales is valuable for grasping the health,
   trends, and nutritional requirements of these giant and profoundly
   intelligent mammals.

   "Body weight is a fundamental characteristic in animals and especially
   whales â they are the largest animals on the planet," said Fredrik
   Christiansen, lead author of the research and a marine ecophysiologist
   at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies in Denmark.

   The old ways of weighing whales, other than finding dead whales on
   shorelines, is grim. "Either you kill a whale as part of a commercial
   or scientific whaling operation," explained Christiansen, "or you can
   rely opportunistically on whales caught in fishing nets."

   But even these limited weighing opportunities are now profoundly rare.
   Today, hunting whales for profit is outlawed by nearly every nation in
   the world, barring defiant operations like those in Iceland and Japan.

   But with this drone innovation, weighing many whales in diverse waters
   is now feasible.

   "It's the first time weâre going to be able to measure free-living
   whales in the wild," said Rachel Cartwright, a whale biologist who runs
   the Keiki Kohola Project, an organization that preserves humpback whale
   habitat in Hawaiian waters. "It's a huge leap forward to be able to do
   this on wild whales with low impact."

   "It's been something that [whale researchers] have been trying to do
   for a while," added Cartwright, who had no role in the research. "The
   fact they managed it is really cool."

   Christiansen flew a drone over southern right whales in the remarkably
   clear waters of Argentina's PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s, where some 1,000 whales
   congregate to breed. "You can fly a drone in from the beach and measure
   them," he said.

   With vivid, detailed whale images, Christiansen and his team then
   developed a program that allows them to plug in the whales' length and
   width to estimate body size. To ensure the estimates were accurate,
   they compared their results to direct weight records of beached and
   hunted right whales (from earlier whaling operations).

   Their model, after being fed data from the drone, produced results that
   closely matched the available weight records â especially in newborn
   calves. "The estimates were spot on," said Christiansen.

   After successfully estimating the body weights of right whales,
   Christiansen now seeks to do the same with other species, and there's a
   critical need. Some whale populations are struggling to find food.

   "We're seeing extreme nutritional stress in several populations," said
   Cartwright, noting certain populations of killer whales, right whales,
   and humpbacks.

   The consequence of insufficient food is often lower reproductive rates,
   explained Cartwright, as the whales can't support as many offspring.
   These nutritional stresses â which will be accelerated and exacerbated
   as the oceans warm and fisheries change â can be spotted earlier in
   whale species if biologists can monitor drops in weight, she said.

   "Weight measurements of live whales at sea inform how chronic stressors
   affect their survival and fecundity, as well as enabling accurate
   sedative dosing of animals entangled in fishing gear that are aversive
   to disentanglement attempts," noted Michael Moore, a senior scientist
   at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a statement.

   One critical issue to remember, emphasized Cartwright, is not just
   anyone can fly a drone over a whale. Every whale is protected by the
   Marine Mammal Protection Act, meaning that without special
   authorization (like for scientific research) a drone can't come closer
   than 1,000 feet of a whale, she said.

   If a drone, with permission, is used carefully, there's likely little
   effect on the cetaceans â though how much of an effect is an area of
   active research, noted Cartwright.

   For drone-flying biologists, the crafts have made a nearly impossible
   scientific measurement, now possible.

   "Thereâs no real way to weigh whales," said Christiansen. "It's nice to
   see that this is possible."

Logan Paul exploits car crash for vlog views, proves he's learned nothing

   You'd think maybe Logan Paul learned his lesson the last time he
   exploited a person for views. Nope.

   The disgraced vlogger now infamous for filming the body of a man who
   died by suicide and including it in his vlog has been spending his
   birthday week disturbing the peace at Yosemite National Park. In
   addition to receiving multiple citations from park rangers, Paul also
   filmed the aftermath of a car crash. Then he uploaded it to his vlog,
   teasing it at the front of the clip for views.

   match

   At about 7 minutes into the vlog, Paul exits a river after falling out
   of a kayak when he hears a loud crash. He runs to the scene of the
   crash where it appears that a pickup truck t-boned a cargo van filled
   with people.

   "Are you guys OK?" Paul and his friend Andy Altig ask a man struggling
   to open the door of the van. A young child can be heard saying "ow"
   over and over again. The two check and make sure help has been called,
   confirming no one is seriously injured before returning to the river to
   retrieve their kayak.

   "Yo, what the fuck?" Paul asks Altig.

   "Yo, this is crazy," Altig responds, giggling to himself. The gang then
   retrieve their kayak, and later return to check on the families.

   This is in no way as bad as what Paul did when he filmed a dead body,
   but this is not a good look for someone who's trying to save face.
   Logan Paul exploited a shocked family with children that were just
   involved in a car crash for views. He didn't even have the decency to
   blur out their faces.

   Yes, I'm sure he was genuinely concerned for their wellbeing. Deep
   down, I don't believe that Logan Paul is a bad person with ill
   intentions, but not everything captured on camera needs to go in a
   vlog. Paul still hasn't learned that.

   After disappearing for less than a month following the suicide video
   controversy, Paul returned stating he was "starting a new chapter" in
   his life. But shortly after returning YouTube cut ad revenue on his
   channel after one of his vlogs featured him tasering a dead rat and
   taking a fish out of water to give it CPR.

   "We believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that
   makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers but also
   potentially damaging to the broader creator community," a spokesperson
   for YouTube said at the time.

   His ad revenue has since been restored, though at the time he remained
   on "probation" by YouTube.

The Most Popular Branded Boards on Pinterest

   Although the vast majority of brand engagement on Pinterest is
   user-generated, many branded accounts have achieved an impressive reach
   of their own.

   Social media-benchmarking company Unmetric took a look at 5,000 branded
   Pinterest boards in mid-March to assess which boards generated the most
   engagement in terms of followers, comments, likes and repins.
   Unsurprisingly, the most popular branded boards tend to fall in
   categories that are already popular among Pinterest's predominantly
   female userbase â namely food, fashion, home and weddings.

   The standout brand in the study is Better Homes and Gardens, whose
   "Blogger Faves From BHG.com" â a group board managed by 10 guest
   pinners â merited the second most repins, the third most likes and the
   fourth greatest number of comments among branded boards. Its "Blogger
   Recipes We Love," another group board with 15 contributors, ranked in
   the top three for repins and likes. Those collaborators are no doubt
   partly responsible for the boards' popularity, as new pins are shared
   not only with Better Homes and Gardens' followers, but also guest
   pinners' followers.

   Giveaway contests are one way to get a lot of comments on a branded
   board. Three of the top five boards in the category â Purex's "Purex
   Promotions," HTC Mobile's "HTC One by Cushnie et Ochs Giveaway" and
   Sephora's "Holiday: 40 Days of Wishes" â asked followers for comments
   in exchange for free prizes. This strategy doesn't necessarily produce
   high-quality comments, however; the majority of comments on HTC's
   giveaway board contain only links to users' repins, for example.

   Here's a breakdown of the most popular branded boards:

Logan Paul exploits car crash for vlog views, proves he's learned nothing

   You'd think maybe Logan Paul learned his lesson the last time he
   exploited a person for views. Nope.

   The disgraced vlogger now infamous for filming the body of a man who
   died by suicide and including it in his vlog has been spending his
   birthday week disturbing the peace at Yosemite National Park. In
   addition to receiving multiple citations from park rangers, Paul also
   filmed the aftermath of a car crash. Then he uploaded it to his vlog,
   teasing it at the front of the clip for views.

   SEE ALSO: Logan Paul says he's going to fight YouTuber KSI in boxing
   match

   At about 7 minutes into the vlog, Paul exits a river after falling out
   of a kayak when he hears a loud crash. He runs to the scene of the
   crash where it appears that a pickup truck t-boned a cargo van filled
   with people.

   "Are you guys OK?" Paul and his friend Andy Altig ask a man struggling
   to open the door of the van. A young child can be heard saying "ow"
   over and over again. The two check and make sure help has been called,
   confirming no one is seriously injured before returning to the river to
   retrieve their kayak.

   "Yo, what the fuck?" Paul asks Altig.

   "Yo, this is crazy," Altig responds, giggling to himself. The gang then
   retrieve their kayak, and later return to check on the families.

   This is in no way as bad as what Paul did when he filmed a dead body,
   but this is not a good look for someone who's trying to save face.
   Logan Paul exploited a shocked family with children that were just
   involved in a car crash for views. He didn't even have the decency to
   blur out their faces.

   Yes, I'm sure he was genuinely concerned for their wellbeing. Deep
   down, I don't believe that Logan Paul is a bad person with ill
   intentions, but not everything captured on camera needs to go in a
   vlog. Paul still hasn't learned that.

   After disappearing for less than a month following the suicide video
   controversy, Paul returned stating he was "starting a new chapter" in
   his life. But shortly after returning YouTube cut ad revenue on his
   channel after one of his vlogs featured him tasering a dead rat and
   taking a fish out of water to give it CPR.

   "We believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that
   makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers but also
   potentially damaging to the broader creator community," a spokesperson
   for YouTube said at the time.

   His ad revenue has since been restored, though at the time he remained
   on "probation" by YouTube.

How do you weigh a massive whale?

   Dead whales, stranded and decaying on beaches, can sometimes be
   weighed. But weighing a live whale is nearly impossible.

   Until now.

   Marine scientists have developed an innovative way to accurately
   estimate the heft of free-living whales by using drones to capture
   aerial footage of cetacean bodies. Scientists published the research
   Wednesday in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

   Knowing the weight of whales is valuable for grasping the health,
   trends, and nutritional requirements of these giant and profoundly
   intelligent mammals.

   "Body weight is a fundamental characteristic in animals and especially
   whales â they are the largest animals on the planet," said Fredrik
   Christiansen, lead author of the research and a marine ecophysiologist
   at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies in Denmark.

   The old ways of weighing whales, other than finding dead whales on
   shorelines, is grim. "Either you kill a whale as part of a commercial
   or scientific whaling operation," explained Christiansen, "or you can
   rely opportunistically on whales caught in fishing nets."

   But even these limited weighing opportunities are now profoundly rare.
   Today, hunting whales for profit is outlawed by nearly every nation in
   the world, barring defiant operations like those in Iceland and Japan.

   But with this drone innovation, weighing many whales in diverse waters
   is now feasible.

   "It's the first time weâre going to be able to measure free-living
   whales in the wild," said Rachel Cartwright, a whale biologist who runs
   the Keiki Kohola Project, an organization that preserves humpback whale
   habitat in Hawaiian waters. "It's a huge leap forward to be able to do
   this on wild whales with low impact."

   "It's been something that [whale researchers] have been trying to do
   for a while," added Cartwright, who had no role in the research. "The
   fact they managed it is really cool."

   Christiansen flew a drone over southern right whales in the remarkably
   clear waters of Argentina's PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s, where some 1,000 whales
   congregate to breed. "You can fly a drone in from the beach and measure
   them," he said.

   With vivid, detailed whale images, Christiansen and his team then
   developed a program that allows them to plug in the whales' length and
   width to estimate body size. To ensure the estimates were accurate,
   they compared their results to direct weight records of beached and
   hunted right whales (from earlier whaling operations).

   Their model, after being fed data from the drone, produced results that
   closely matched the available weight records â especially in newborn
   calves. "The estimates were spot on," said Christiansen.

   After successfully estimating the body weights of right whales,
   Christiansen now seeks to do the same with other species, and there's a
   critical need. Some whale populations are struggling to find food.

   "We're seeing extreme nutritional stress in several populations," said
   Cartwright, noting certain populations of killer whales, right whales,
   and humpbacks.

   The consequence of insufficient food is often lower reproductive rates,
   explained Cartwright, as the whales can't support as many offspring.
   These nutritional stresses â which will be accelerated and exacerbated
   as the oceans warm and fisheries change â can be spotted earlier in
   whale species if biologists can monitor drops in weight, she said.

   "Weight measurements of live whales at sea inform how chronic stressors
   affect their survival and fecundity, as well as enabling accurate
   sedative dosing of animals entangled in fishing gear that are aversive
   to disentanglement attempts," noted Michael Moore, a senior scientist
   at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a statement.

   One critical issue to remember, emphasized Cartwright, is not just
   anyone can fly a drone over a whale. Every whale is protected by the
   Marine Mammal Protection Act, meaning that without special
   authorization (like for scientific research) a drone can't come closer
   than 1,000 feet of a whale, she said.

   If a drone, with permission, is used carefully, there's likely little
   effect on the cetaceans â though how much of an effect is an area of
   active research, noted Cartwright.

   For drone-flying biologists, the crafts have made a nearly impossible
   scientific measurement, now possible.

   "Thereâs no real way to weigh whales," said Christiansen. "It's nice to
   see that this is possible."

Libra may be losing support from key partners already

   Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra is looking less likely to launch as
   originally envisioned by the day.

   A new report from the Wall Street Journal claims that key partners,
   including Visa and Mastercard, are having second thoughts about their
   involvement in Libra.

   These and other partners have initially signed up to be part of the
   Libra Association, a Swiss-based organization that's supposed to govern
   Libra. But after intense scrutiny from lawmakers in the U.S. and
   Europe, some of these partners are reportedly unhappy with Facebook's
   answers on how Libra will handle illegal activities, including money
   laundering and financing of terror groups, on the platform.

   Also notable is the lack of public support from Facebook's Libra
   partners. In July, Mashable has asked six of them, including Visa and
   Mastercard, whether they still support Libra, and received no answers.
   And I've seen no public statements of support from them since, leaving
   Facebook to defend the project on its own.

   So far, this has mostly been left to Head of Calibra (which is a wallet
   for Libra) David Marcus â and sure enough, he commented on WSJ's story
   on Twitter shortly after it was published.

     Felt like addressing this. 1) official 1st wave of Libra Association
     members will be formalized in the weeks to come; (continued)

     â David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 1, 2019

   According to Marcus, the official "1st wave of Libra Association
   members will be formalized in the weeks to come." It's unclear whether
   this means all 22 partners that were listed at Libra's launch in June,
   and Marcus said in the same Twitter thread that he has "no knowledge of
   specific organizations [sic] plans to not step up."

   Marcus did say that the notion that Facebook did not share "detailed
   information about how to secure Libra and protect the network against
   illegal activity is categorically untrue."

   "We're very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate
   concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the
   value of digital currencies to the forefront," he tweeted.

   Should Libra lose support from Visa and Mastercard, it would be a major
   blow to the nascent cryptocurrency and payment platform. According to
   the Journal, representatives from the companies backing Libra are
   scheduled to meet on Oct. 14 in Geneva to review the association's
   charter and appoint a board of directors.

   The WSJ's report follows a recent report by Reuters quoting Bertrand
   Perez, the managing director of Libra Association, as saying that Libra
   may not launch in June 2020 as originally envisioned, but perhaps one
   or two quarters later.

   In possibly the most relatable verses since Lizzo asked why men great
   'til they gotta be great, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda appeared
   on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon to freestyle about hating
   open-plan offices and other everyday pet peeves.

   "Still hungover from my day on Sunday / Karen comes over, 'Looks like a
   case of the Mondays!'" spits Miranda. "Go away, Karen!"

   Miranda was joined by the rest of his hip-hop improv group Freestyle
   Love Supreme: Anthony Veneziale, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Aneesa Folds, Chris
   Sullivan, Arthur Lewis and Bill Sherman. Though love is literally in
   their name, the group stuck to rapping about topics the audience hated,
   including college debt and Tinder dates with nasty bunions â and was
   rewarded with a standing ovation.
