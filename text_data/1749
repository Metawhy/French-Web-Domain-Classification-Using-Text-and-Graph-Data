   client

   "I’d like to announce today 19th March 2019 the launch of our website
   and Apple and Android applications. Our first postings went out on
   social media this afternoon and it is with great pride and joy that I
   can now say that we are officially LIVE!
   Reaching this milestone could not have been possible without all of you
   so I am writing to share this happy moment and most of all to thank you
   for the patience and dedication you have demonstrated to me and Dion
   throughout these long months leading up to today.
   As we embark on the next leg of this exciting venture we feel all the
   more confident knowing we have the back up of a strong team of reliable
   colleagues like yourselves. Its late in India now and most of you are
   most probably sleeping but our thoughts are with you as we quietly
   celebrate so, on behalf of myself and Dion CONGRATULATIONS and may this
   mark the beginning of a successful and fantastic venture for us all!
   Sincerely,
   Nick"
   Nicholas Chambers,
   client

   "I would highly recommend Agriya and their Getlancer platform. I'm
   highly impressed with how they implemented the platform using plugins.
   This makes expanding much simpler. I found the company to be very easy
   to work with and responsive to our needs. Thanks to Prathiba, Varun and
   Mohamed for your great efforts!"
   Eric McNeal, Ghana
   client

   "Thank you for facilitating the possibility of a software walkthrough.
   We found some very minor glitches in my software. They do not stop the
   use but just need some tweeking. They are being addressed.
   I want to say that Vignesh lead the meeting very well. He listened, had
   clear responses, and more over made me feel like my project is going to
   get done.
   Looking toward the future, there are minor design changes I want to
   incorporate , but as you and I had discussed, I will leave them for
   now, so I can launch this. This is very keen advice and thank you for
   that.
   I also want to mention Vinoth Raj, he was also very helpful. And
   explained some of the realities of Paypal and some of the Admin Panel
   where I was confused. Not confused about those parts anymore.
   This way of working -the software walk through- was a great experience.
   I am grateful.
   I appreciate the comments, the support, and keen interest in making
   this happen for me."
