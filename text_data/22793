   Drone Strikes Abroad

Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?

   Last updated on: 5/1/2017 | Author: ProCon.org

   Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), otherwise known as drones, are
   remotely-controlled aircraft which may be armed with missiles and bombs
   for attack missions. Since the World Trade Center attacks of Sep. 11,
   2001 and the subsequent “War on Terror,” the United States has used
   drones to kill suspected terrorists in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen,
   Somalia, and other countries.

   Proponents say that drones have decimated terrorist networks abroad via
   precise strikes with minimal civilian casualties. They contend that
   drones are relatively inexpensive weapons, are used under proper
   government oversight, and that their use helps prevent “boots on the
   ground” combat and makes America safer.

   Opponents say that drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill.
   They contend that drone strikes kill large numbers of civilians,
   violate international law, lack sufficient congressional oversight,
   violate the sovereignty of other nations, and make the horrors of war
   appear as innocuous as a video game. Read more background…

Pro & Con Arguments

Pro 1

Drone strikes make the United States safer by decimating terrorist networks
across the world.

     Drone attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia have
     killed upwards of 3,500 militants, including dozens of high-level
     commanders implicated in organizing plots against the United States.
     [6] [7] [8] [9] According to President Obama, "dozens of highly
     skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives
     have been taken off the battlefield. Plots have been disrupted that
     would have targeted international aviation, US transit systems,
     European cities, and our troops in Afghanistan. Simply put, these
     strikes have saved lives." [10] David Rohde, a former New York Times
     reporter held hostage by the Taliban in Pakistan for several months
     in 2009, called the drones a "terrifying presence" for militants.
     [11] On Nov. 1, 2013 drone strikes killed Pakistani Taliban leader
     Hakimullah Mehsud. [12] Read More

Pro 2

Drones kill fewer civilians, as a percentage of total fatalities, than any
other military weapon.

     The traditional weapons of war - bombs, shells, mines, mortars -
     cause more unintended ("collateral") damage to people and property
     than drones, whose accuracy and technical precision mostly limit
     casualties to combatants and intended targets. [13] Although
     estimates vary because of the secretive nature of the program, it is
     estimated that 174 to 1,047 civilians have been killed in Pakistan,
     Yemen, and Somalia since the United States began conducting drone
     strikes abroad following the Sep. 11, 2001 attacks, roughly 8-17% of
     all deaths from US drones. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In comparison, in
     World War II, civilian deaths, as a percentage of total war
     fatalities, are estimated at 40 to 67%. [13] [14] In the Korean,
     [15] Vietnam, [16] and Balkan Wars, [17] the percentages are
     approximately 70%, 31%, and 45% respectively. Read More

Pro 3

Drones make US military personnel safer.

     Drones are launched from bases in allied countries and are operated
     remotely by pilots in the United States, minimizing the risk of
     injury and death that would occur if ground soldiers and airplane
     pilots were used instead. [18] Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their
     affiliates often operate in distant and environmentally unforgiving
     locations where it would be extremely dangerous for the United
     States to deploy teams of special forces to track and capture
     terrorists. Such pursuits may pose serious risks to US troops
     including firefights with surrounding tribal communities,
     anti-aircraft shelling, land mines, improvised explosive devices
     (IEDs), suicide bombers, snipers, dangerous weather conditions,
     harsh environments, etc. Drone strikes eliminate all of those risks
     common to "boots on the ground" missions. [10] Read More

Pro 4

Drone strikes are cheaper than engaging in ground or manned aerial combat.

     With approximately $5 billion allocated for drones in the 2012
     Department of Defense budget, [19] America's entire drone program
     constitutes only about 1% of the entire annual military budget. [20]
     In comparison, the military's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program
     alone cost the United States $9.7 billion in fiscal year 2012. [21]
     US manned military attack aircraft cost anywhere from $18,000 to
     $169,000 per hour to operate - six to 42 times more than attack
     drones. [22] Al Qaeda spent roughly half a million dollars to plan
     and execute the attacks on the United States on Sep. 11, 2001. [23]
     In response, the United States spent roughly $2.2 trillion on
     funding manned air and ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and on
     homeland security costs in the following decade - over $4 million
     for every dollar al Qaeda spent. [23] Read More

Pro 5

Drone strikes are legal under international law.

     Article 51 of the UN Charter provides for a nation's inherent right
     to self-defense when it has been attacked. [24] The UN Special
     Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions has
     said that Article 51 applies if the targeted state agrees to the use
     of force in its territory, or the targeted group operating within
     its territory was responsible for an act of aggression against the
     targeting state where the host state is unwilling or unable to
     control the threat themselves. [25] Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen,
     and Somalia have officially consented to US drone strikes within
     their countries because they are unable to control terrorist groups
     within their own borders. [26] Former US State Department Legal
     Adviser and current Yale Professor of International Law Harold Koh
     says that a state engaged in an "armed conflict or in legitimate
     self-defense" is not required to provide targets with legal
     processing before using lethal force, and a country may target
     individuals in foreign countries if they are directly participating
     in hostilities or posing an imminent threat that only lethal force
     can prevent. [27] The United States also has the right under
     international law to "anticipatory self-defense," which gives the
     right to use force against a real and imminent threat when the
     necessity of that self-defense is "instant, overwhelming, and
     leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation." [28]

Pro 6

Drone strikes are legal under US law.

     Presidential powers under Article II of the US Constitution allow
     the use of force against an imminent threat without congressional
     approval. [29] Additionally, in 2001 Congress passed the
     Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), authorizing armed
     conflict with al Qaeda and associated forces indefinitely. [30] The
     AUMF states that the President is "authorized to use all necessary
     and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
     persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
     terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored
     such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts
     of international terrorism against the United States by such
     nations, organizations or persons." [31] The AUMF does not have a
     geographic boundary, and the Obama administration notes that al
     Qaeda militants far from the battlefield in Afghanistan are still
     engaged in armed conflict with the United States and therefore
     covered under the law. [32] Read More

Pro 7

Drones limit the scope and scale of military action.

     Since the 9/11 attacks, the main threats to US security are
     decentralized terrorist networks operating in countries around the
     world, not large countries fighting with massive air, ground, and
     sea armies. Invading Pakistan, Yemen, or Somalia to capture
     relatively small terrorist groups would lead the United States to
     expensive conflict, responsibility for destabilizing those
     governments, large numbers of civilian casualties, empowerment of
     enemies who view the United States as an occupying imperialist
     power, US military deaths, and other unintended consequences.
     America's attempt to destroy al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan
     by invading and occupying the country resulted in a war that has
     dragged on for over 12 years. Using drone strikes against terrorists
     abroad allows the United States to achieve its goals at a fraction
     of the cost of an invasion in money, manpower, and lives. Read More

Pro 8

Drone strikes are subject to a strict review process and congressional
oversight.

     President Obama, in his "Presidential Policy Guidance" released on
     May 23, 2013, established five criteria that must be met before
     lethal action may be taken against a foreign target: "1) Near
     certainty that the terrorist target is present; 2) Near certainty
     that non-combatants will not be injured or killed; 3) An assessment
     that capture is not feasible at the time of the operation; 4) An
     assessment that the relevant governmental authorities in the country
     where action is contemplated cannot or will not effectively address
     the threat to U.S. persons; and 5) An assessment that no other
     reasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat to
     U.S. persons." [33] Intelligence committees and "appropriate"
     members of Congress are briefed on every strike that America takes.
     [33] Months before the targeting of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki
     in Yemen, the Obama administration submitted information for comment
     to the Department of Justice, which conducted additional analysis to
     ensure that the action was consistent with US laws. [10] Read More

Pro 9

Drone strikes are carried out with the collaboration and encouragement of
local governments, and make those countries safer.

     US drone strikes help countries fight terrorist threats to their own
     domestic peace and stability, including al Qaeda and the Taliban in
     Pakistan, al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
     in Yemen, and al Qaeda in the Maghreb in Algeria and Mali. Yemen’s
     President, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has openly praised drone strikes
     in his country, stating that the "electronic brain’s precision is
     unmatched by the human brain." [34] In a 2008 State Department cable
     made public by Wikileaks, Pakistani Chief of Army Staff General
     Ashfaq Kayani asked US officials for more drone strikes, [35] and in
     Apr. 2013 former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf acknowledged
     to CNN that his government had secretly signed off on US drone
     strikes. [36] In Pakistan, where the vast majority of drone strikes
     are carried out, drones have contributed to a major decrease in
     violence. The 41 suicide attacks in Pakistan in 2011 were down from
     49 in 2010 and a record high of 87 in 2009, which coincided with an
     over ten-fold increase in the number of drone strikes. [37] Read

Pro 10

The United States cannot risk falling behind the rest of the world in the
development of drone technologies.

     More than 87 countries own some type of surveillance or attack
     drone, changing the way nations conduct war and threatening to begin
     a new arms race as governments scramble to counterbalance their
     adversaries. [38] In 2010 Iran unveiled what it claimed was its
     first armed drone, [39] and China unveiled 25 drone models. [40] In
     2011 there were 680 active drone development programs run by
     governments, companies, and research institutes around the world,
     compared with 195 in 2005. [41] [41] The Teal Group, a
     defense-consulting firm, estimated in June 2013 that the global
     market for the research, development, and procurement of armed
     drones would nearly double over the next decade from $5.2 billion
     annually to $11.6 billion. [43] Insurgent groups are also moving to
     acquire this technology; in 2011, Libyan opposition forces bought a
     drone during their attempt to overthrow dictator Moammar Gadhafi
     [44] and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah claimed in 2012 that it
     flew an Iranian-made drone over Israel. [45] Read More

Pro 11

Drone pilots have a lower risk for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than
pilots of manned aircraft and other battlefield soldiers.

     Drone pilots suffer less than traditional pilots because they do not
     have to be directly present on the battlefield, can live a normal
     civilian life in the United States, and do not risk death or serious
     injury. Only 4% of active-duty drone pilots are at "high risk for
     PTSD" compared to the 12-17% of soldiers returning from Iraq and
     Afghanistan. [46] Read More

Pro 12

The majority of Americans support drone strikes.

     According to a July 18, 2013 survey by Pew Research, 61% of
     Americans supported drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.
     [2] Support spanned the political divide, including Republicans
     (69%), independents (60%), and Democrats (59%). [2] A Mar. 20, 2013
     poll by the Gallup organization found that 65% of Americans believed
     the US government should "use drones to launch airstrikes in other
     countries against suspected terrorists" and 74% of Americans who
     "very" or "somewhat" closely follow news stories about drones
     supported the attacks. [47] A May 28, 2013 Christian Science
     Monitor/TIPP poll found that 57% of Americans supported drone
     strikes targeting "al Qaeda targets and other terrorists in foreign
     countries." [48] Read More

Con 1

Drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill.

     People who see their loved ones injured or killed in drone attacks
     become motivated to join actions against the United States.
     According to author Jeremy Scahill, the vast majority of militants
     operating in Yemen today are "people who are aggrieved by attacks on
     their homes that forced them to go out and fight." [48] Support for
     al Qaeda in Yemen is "indigenously spreading and merging with the
     mounting rage of powerful tribes at US counterterrorism policy" as
     the drone strikes have "recruited thousands." [49] The number of Al
     Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) core members grew from 300 in
     2009 (when US drone strikes resumed after a seven-year hiatus) to
     700 in 2012, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of
     terrorist attacks in the region. [50] Both the "Underwear Bomber,"
     who tried to blow up an American airliner in 2009, [51] and the
     "Times Square Bomber," who tried to set off a car bomb in New York
     City in 2010, [52] cited drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and
     Somalia as motivators for the plots. Read More

Con 2

Drone strikes target individuals who may not be terrorists or enemy
combatants.

     President Obama's policy of "signature strikes" allows the Central
     Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the military's Joint Special
     Operations Command (JSOC) to target anyone who fits a specific
     terrorist profile or engages in behavior the US government
     associates with terrorists, regardless of whether or not they have
     been conclusively identified by name as enemy combatants. [53]
     Classified documents leaked in Oct. 2015 showed that in one
     five-month period of drone strikes in Afghanistan, as many as 90
     percent of those killed were not the intended targets, and that
     those unintended deaths were classified as "enemies killed in
     action" regardless of whether they were civilians or combatants.
     [120] At the height of the drone program in Pakistan in 2009 and
     2010, as many as half of the strikes were classified as signature
     strikes. [54] According to top-secret intelligence reports reviewed
     by McClatchy Newspapers, drone operators are not always certain of
     who they are killing "despite the administration's guarantees of the
     accuracy of the CIA's targeting intelligence." [55] The CIA and JSOC
     target "associated forces," "foreign fighters," "suspected
     extremists," and "other militants," but do not publicly reveal
     whether those killed are actively involved in terrorism against the
     United States. [56] In two sets of classified documents obtained by
     NBC News describing 114 drone strikes in Pakistan and Afghanistan
     between Sep. 3, 2010 and Oct. 30, 2011, 26 strikes targeted "other
     militants," meaning that the CIA could not conclusively determine
     the affiliation of those killed. [54] Read More

Con 3

Drone strikes kill large numbers of civilians and traumatize local
populations.

     According to a meta-study of drone strikes, between 8 to 17% of all
     people killed in drone strikes are civilians. [5] Since the United
     States began conducting drone strikes abroad following the Sep. 11,
     2001 attacks, it is estimated that between 174 and 1,047 civilians
     have been killed in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. [6] [7] [8] [9]
     According to 130 interviews with victims and witnesses of drone
     strikes by researchers from Stanford and New York University, people
     who live in the affected areas experience harm "beyond death and
     physical injury" and "hear drones hover 24 hours a day," and live
     with the fear that a strike could occur at any moment of the day or
     night. [57] According to Clive Stafford Smith, Director of human
     rights organization Reprieve, "an entire region is being terrorized
     by the constant threat of death from the skies. Their way of life is
     collapsing: kids are too terrified to go to school, adults are
     afraid to attend weddings, funerals, business meetings, or anything
     that involves gathering in groups." [58] Yemeni tribal sheik Mullah
     Zabara says "we consider the drones terrorism. The drones are flying
     day and night, frightening women and children, disturbing sleeping
     people. This is terrorism." [49] Read More

Con 4

Drone strikes mostly kill low-value targets who are not significant threats
to US safety and security.

     Drones kill very few "high-value" targets with alleged leadership
     roles in al Qaeda or anti-US Taliban factions. [57] Reuters reported
     that of the 500 "militants" the CIA believed it had killed with
     drones between 2008 and 2010, only 14 were "top-tier militant
     targets," and 25 were "mid-to-high-level organizers" of al Qaeda,
     the Taliban, or other hostile groups. [59] The CIA had killed around
     12 times more low-level fighters than mid-to-high-level during that
     same period. [59] According to the New America Foundation, from 2004
     to 2012 an estimated 49 "militant leaders" were killed in drone
     strikes, constituting "2% of all drone-related fatalities." [60]
     Read More

Con 5

Drone strikes violate international law.

     Under international humanitarian law, the targeted individual must
     be directly participating in hostilities with the United States.
     [57] Under international human rights law, the targeted individual
     must pose an imminent threat that only lethal force can prevent.
     [57] Simply being suspected of some connection to a "militant"
     organization — or, under the CIA's policy of "signature" drone
     strikes, fitting the profile of a terrorist in an area where
     terrorists are known to operate – is not legally sufficient to make
     someone a permissible target for killing. [63] Article 6(1) of the
     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a multilateral
     treaty adopted by the United Nations, states that "no one shall be
     arbitrarily deprived of his life," even in times of armed conflict.
     [61] Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of
     force by one state against another, [64] with the exceptions of (1)
     the consent of the host state, [65] and (2) when the use of force is
     in self-defense in response to an armed attack or an imminent
     threat, where the host state is unwilling or unable to take
     appropriate action. [25] Members of militant groups with which the
     United States is not in an armed conflict are therefore not lawful
     targets. [62] Amnesty International says drone strikes can be
     classified as "war crimes" or illegal "extrajudicial executions."
     [66] Read More

Con 6

Drone strikes are secretive, lack sufficient legal oversight, and prevent
citizens from holding their leaders accountable.

     Drones are used in conflicts where war is not openly declared and
     authorized by Congress, allowing the executive branch to have nearly
     unlimited power over secret wars across the world. Strikes by the
     CIA (responsible for approximately 80% of all US drone strikes
     worldwide) are classified under US law as Title 50 covert actions,
     defined as "activities of the United States Government... where it
     is intended that the role... will not be apparent or acknowledged
     publicly." [67] As covert operations, the government cannot legally
     provide any information about how the CIA conducts targeted
     killings. [67] The CIA has yet to officially acknowledge its drone
     programs anywhere in the world, [66] let alone describe the rules
     and procedures for compliance with US and international law. [66]
     The administration only gives drone program details to members of
     Congress whom it deems "appropriate," [33] and it has sought to
     prevent judicial review of claims brought in US courts by human
     rights groups seeking accountability for potentially unlawful
     killings. [69] Read More

Con 7

Drone strikes violate the sovereignty of other countries.

     Strikes are often carried out without the permission and against the
     objection of the target countries. Pakistan's foreign ministry on
     June 4, 2012 called drone strikes "illegal" and said they violated
     the country’s sovereignty. [70] On Oct. 22, 2013, Pakistani Prime
     Minister Nawaz Sharif said that the "use of drones is not only a
     continued violation of our territorial integrity but also
     detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from
     our country... I would therefore stress the need for an end to drone
     attacks." [71] The United Nations' Human Rights Chief, [72] Special
     Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, [73] and Special
     Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions [74]
     have all called US drone strikes a violation of sovereignty, and
     have pressed for investigations into the legality of the attacks. In
     a July 18, 2013, 39-country survey by Pew Research, only six
     countries approved of US drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and
     Somalia. [2] Read More

Con 8

Drone strikes allow the United States to become emotionally disconnected from
the horrors of war.

     According to Keith Shurtleff, US army chaplain and ethics
     instructor, as soldiers are "physically and psychologically removed
     from the horrors of battle and see the enemy not as humans but as
     blips on a screen, there is a danger of losing the deterrent to war
     that its horrors normally provide." [75] Without this deterrent, it
     becomes easier for the United States to start new battles and extend
     existing conflicts indefinitely. Drone pilot Colonel D. Scott
     Brenton, in a July 29, 2012 interview with the New York Times,
     acknowledged the disconnect of fighting a "telewar with a joystick
     and a throttle" thousands of miles away from the battlefield, then
     driving home to have dinner with his family. "I feel no emotional
     attachment to the enemy," he said. "I have a duty, and I execute the
     duty. No one in my immediate environment is aware of anything that
     occurred." [76] According to Representative Lynn Woolsey (D-CA),
     it's "such a trend to dehumanize warfare. It's machines and
     computers doing the job... [but this] is not video games, these are
     real people and it's real death and we're making real enemies around
     the world by continuing with the drone strikes." [77] Read More

Con 9

US drone strikes give cover for other countries to engage in human rights
abuses.

     America's use of drones in foreign countries makes it all but
     impossible to demand that other countries self-impose limitations on
     their own drone use. Just as the United States justifies its drone
     strikes with the argument that it is at war with al Qaeda and its
     affiliates, drone strikes may be used by other countries to target
     what they consider terrorists and what Americans would consider as
     cover for human rights abuses against non-combatants. [11] China
     could justify drone strikes against Tibetan separatists in India,
     Russia could justify attacks against rebels in Chechnya, or Turkey
     could target Kurdish insurgents in Iraq. Philip Alston, former UN
     Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
     executions, said that an "arms race" spurred by the widespread use
     of drones by the US government is already well under way. [78] Read
     More

Con 10

Drone strikes are extremely unpopular in the affected countries.

     General Stanley McChrystal, former leader of the US military in
     Afghanistan, says that the "resentment created by American use of
     unmanned strikes... is much greater than the average American
     appreciates. They are hated on a visceral level, even by people
     who've never seen one or seen the effects of one." [79] 76% of
     residents in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of
     northwestern Pakistan (where 96% of drone strikes in the country are
     carried out) oppose American drone strikes. [80] 16% think these
     strikes accurately target militants and 48% think they largely kill
     civilians. [81] Only 17% of Pakistanis back American drone strikes
     against leaders of extremist groups, even if they are conducted in
     conjunction with the Pakistani government. [82] On three separate
     occasions, Pakistan's Parliament has voted to condemn the attacks
     and end the country's cooperation with the CIA, [83] and leaders in
     the FATA voted on Nov. 4, 2013 to block NATO supply lines unless the
     United States stops its drone strikes. [84] On Dec. 16, 2013,
     Yemen's parliament passed a motion calling for the United States to
     end its drone program in the country after a wedding convoy of 11 to
     15 people were killed by a US drone strike. [85] Read More

Con 11

Many drone operators have emotional and psychological stress.

     A study from the US Air Force’s School of Aerospace Medicine,
     Department of Neuropsychiatry, found that drone pilots, in addition
     to witnessing traumatic combat experiences, face several unique
     problems: lack of a clear demarcation between combat and
     personal/family life; extremely long hours with monotonous work and
     low staffing; "existential conflict" brought on by the guilt and
     remorse over being an "aerial sniper"; and social isolation during
     work, which could diminish unit cohesion and increase susceptibility
     to PTSD. [46] According to a study of 709 drone pilots by the Armed
     Forces Health Surveillance Center, approximately 8.2% reported at
     least one adverse mental health outcome, most commonly disorders
