   Let's write your first Twilio code.

   Use your mobile phone to send an SMS with the phrase "lorem ipsum" to
   (555) 555-5555. You should receive a reply which says "Ahoy, world!"

   Awesome! Now let‚Äôs learn how to reply to messages.

   Next: Introduction to TwiML

   The code to the leftbelow is TwiML, the Twilio Markup Language. You use
   TwiML to tell Twilio how to respond to incoming text messages and phone
   calls.

   The <Message> TwiML element replies to incoming text messages. Let‚Äôs
   edit this TwiML to personalize the message, like "Hi [your name]!"
   Spice the message up with an emoji. "Greetings human ü§ñ".

   Send any message to your phone number and you‚Äôll see your new reply.

   Next: TwiML templating

   When your app gets a text, Twilio asks your app how to respond and
   includes data about the incoming message like the message‚Äôs contents
   and the phone number it was sent from.

   Try accessing that data in your TwiML. Use double curly braces to
   include the variable in your response. Here are a few you can try: ‚Äú{{
   Body }}‚Äù, ‚Äú{{ From }}‚Äù, ‚Äú{{ FromCountry }}‚Äù.

   When you build your Twilio app, you‚Äôll use these fields with your own
   code to power personalized conversations with your users.

   Next: Beyond TwiML

   Congrats! You now know the basics of using TwiML.

   TwiML is just one way to send text messages with Twilio. You can send
   outbound messages anytime you want using our HTTP API or our SDK for
   your programming language.

   Sign up for your free Twilio account and you‚Äôll have your own Twilio
   number. Next, play through TwilioQuest to unlock the secrets of
   Twilio‚Äôs advanced features.

   We can't wait to see what you build.
