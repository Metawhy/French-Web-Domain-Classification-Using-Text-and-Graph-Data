Website Monitoring

   Monitor website uptime & page load speed.
     * Monitor web page performance from within a real browser
       Our Dotcom-Tools website speed test has been used to evaluate
       millions of websites, web frameworks and web hosts around the
       world. This website monitoring service has been used to rank the
       best WordPress hosting platforms, determining which WordPress
       hosting solution offers the optimal server configurations yielding
       the lowest latency and fastest website performance.
     * Receive alerts when your website goes down and gain insight to
       improve page speed performance and uptime
     * Web-based monitoring to help you optimize the end-user experience
       of your website
       As a webmaster, web app developer, or DevOps team, building a fast
       and consistent user experience should be the most crucial part of
       your digital experience strategy. For front-end client facing
       websites, choosing the fastest web hosting is essential to
       performance optimization. From there, adherence to website
       performance best practices, such as code minification, image
       compression, proper caching and utilizing a CDN are necessary. Once
       those bases are in place, webmasters should implement a website
       monitoring solution such as Dotcom-Monitor to proactively test
       website performance; getting alerted immediately of uptime,
       performance and functionality issues the moment they arise.
     * Customizable features include custom thresholds to trigger alerts
       via SMS text, land-line phone, pager, email and more
     * Keyword validation: specify words or phrases that you wish to
       search for within web page content & receive an alert when it’s not
       present
