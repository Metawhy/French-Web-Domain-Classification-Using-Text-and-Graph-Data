TOP500 Becomes a Petaflop Club for Supercomputers

   BERKELEY, Calif.; FRANKFURT, Germany; and KNOXVILLE, Tenn.— The 53rd
   edition of the TOP500 marks a milestone in the 26-year history of the
   list. For the first time, all 500 systems deliver a petaflop or more on
   the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, with the entry level to
   the list now at 1.022 petaflops.

Are Printed Circuit Boards on Their Way Out?

   Has the time come to say goodbye to printed circuit boards? Maybe not
   today, but soon, say two researchers from UCLA. Puneet
   Gupta and Subramanian Iyer make the case for what they call
   ‘silicon-interconnect fabric’ – SiIF for short – in which bare chips
   are connected directly to wiring on a separate piece of silicon. “A

ExaNeSt project successfully builds prototype for exascale

   Today the whole world is trying to push supercomputer technology to the
   exascale level, i.e. a billion billion calculations per second. In
   Europe, this exascale vision will be made possible with contributions
   by Consortia funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the EU in projects
   such as ExaNeSt, which built a first 'straw man' prototype, having
   worked on this since 2016. .

The List

06/2019 Highlights

   The top of the list remains largely unchanged, with only two new
   entries in the top 10, one of which was an existing system that was
   upgraded with additional capacity.
     * Two IBM-built supercomputers, Summit and Sierra, installed at the
       Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in
       Tennessee and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California,
       respectively, retain the first two positions on the list. Both
       derive their computational power from Power 9 CPUs and NVIDIA V100
       GPUs. The Summit system slightly improved its HPL result from six
       months ago, delivering a record 148.6 petaflops, while the number
       two Sierra system remains unchanged at 94.6 petaflops.
     * The Sunway TaihuLight, a system developed by China’s National
       Research Center of Parallel Computer Engineering & Technology
       (NRCPC) and installed at the National Supercomputing Center in
       Wuxi, holds the number three position with 93.0 petaflops. It’s
       powered by more than 10 million SW26010 processor cores.
     * At number four is the Tianhe-2A (Milky Way-2A) supercomputer,
       developed by China’s National University of Defense Technology
       (NUDT) and deployed at the National Supercomputer Center in
       Guangzhou. It used a combination of Intel Xeon and Matrix-2000
       processors to achieve an HPL result of 61.4 petaflops.
     * Frontera, the only new supercomputer in the top 10, attained its
       number five ranking by delivering 23.5 petaflops on HPL. The Dell
       C6420 system, powered by Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 processors, is
       installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center of the University
       of Texas.
