   The decade-long trend of strong growth in renewable energy capacity
   continued in 2018 with global additions of 171 gigawatts (GW). The
   annual increase of 7.9% was bolstered by new additions from solar and
   wind energy, which accounted for 84% of the growth. Globally, total
   renewable energy generation capacity reached 2,351 GW at the end of
   last year – around a third of total installed electricity capacity.
   Oceania witnessed the fastest growth with a 17.7% rise in 2018. Asia
   was second with a 11.4% rise followed by Africa with 8.4% growth.
   Nearly two-thirds of all new power generation capacity added in 2018
   was from renewables, led by emerging and developing economies.

   The decade-long trend of strong growth in renewable energy capacity
   continued in 2018 with global additions of 171 gigawatts (GW). The
   annual increase of 7.9% was bolstered by new additions from solar and
   wind energy, which accounted for 84% of the growth. Globally, total
   renewable energy generation capacity reached 2,351 GW at the end of
   last year – around a third of total installed electricity capacity.
   Oceania witnessed the fastest growth with a 17.7% rise in 2018. Asia
   was second with a 11.4% rise followed by Africa with 8.4% growth.
