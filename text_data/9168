   My integration with Joomla! starts back in 2010, where as a student I
   had to build a "boring" project. Over the years, and after studying
   most of web technologies, I've made Joomla! a part of my life and work.
   I was always trying to learn and master the technological "trend" of
   the time with only one purpose, to mix them all together in the most
   efficient way. Well guess what, {first_step: installJoomla!()} .
