WORK IN PROGRESS...the sequel

   For those of you who follow me on Instagram  you will be aware that at
   the beginning of August I ran a 3 day Sketch Book Master Class at the
   yard:ARTspace
   [IMG_2394.JPG] [IMG_2395.JPG]
   As part of the workshop I develop a demonstration sketch book along
   side everyone. I completed 6 pages of the 20 pages in the book. Excited
   by the workshop I then announced to the world (well those following me
   on Facebook and Instagram) that I would complete the book doing a page
   a day.
   [IMG_2396.JPG]
   Each day I spent no more that an hour.
   [IMG_2397.JPG] [IMG_2398.JPG]
   working on this document.
   [IMG_2399.JPG]
   Keeping it small helps and adding eco dyed pages that speak for
   themselves takes the pressure off.
   [IMG_2400.JPG] [IMG_2401.JPG]
   An hour a day means that the images begin to have their own confidence.
   A time limit means that less is more is a built in factor.
   [IMG_2402.JPG]
   So where do I go now that I have formed this habit?
   [IMG_2385.JPG] [IMG_2388.JPG]
   Into my A2 sketch book and work at a bigger scale. Here you can see the
   comparison.
   [IMG_2361.JPG] [IMG_2364.JPG]
   How do I start a mixed media page? Especially a big one?
   I randomly cover the page with gum arabic transfer prints, then Quink,
   then ink.
   [IMG_2365.JPG] [IMG_2372.JPG]
   That will be the closest I get to abstract...as I will then start to
   draw my theme with white acrylic paint.
   [IMG_2366.JPG]
   It is now difficult to explain how I work into this, but adding,
   covering and adding again using
   [IMG_2368.JPG]
   paint, stencils and collage
   [IMG_2370.JPG]
   until the image is doing what I want...
   [IMG_2371.JPG]
   another difficult concept to explain.
   [IMG_2373.JPG]
   Now where? Onto fabric I think...???

WORK IN PROGRESS I...

   Looking over past blog posts, there is a pattern. When I have my summer
   break I experiment. Some times new images, but the past few summers I
   have found myself experimenting with new processes.
   [IMG_2374.JPG]
   I made these mixed media drawings earlier in the year and
   [IMG_2375.JPG]
    have found myself sitting on the idea in the hope that inspiration
   will come. If you wait long enough something happens? I decided to
   photo copy the drawings and turn them into gum arabic transfer prints.
   [IMG_2379.JPG]
   These are the results so far.
   [IMG_2380.JPG] [IMG_2381.JPG]
   A series of layered prints on cotton.
   [IMG_2383.JPG]
   Certainly works in progress. Something is missing.
   [IMG_2384.JPG]
   I had a little break through by printing
   [IMG_2376.JPG]
   onto a piece of eco printed fabric (another experimental obsession at
   the moment)
   [IMG_2377.JPG] [IMG_2378.JPG]
   Now I need to see what will happen if I eco print into the earlier
   fabric samples.
   Working progressively over several days back to back helps to generate
   ideas. It is no good for me to do a bit once a week, I have to be head
   down and work on ideas solidly over a number of consecutive hours,
   putting right things that go wrong and developing things that go right.
   Its getting over the little voice in my head that says, 'Nah don't
   bother'
   What does your little voice say?

AND BREATH...

   It has now been a week since I gave over my house, garden and life to
   Cheltenham Open Studios.
   A week of people coming to see me and my work and that of the
   incredibly talented Caroline McCatty and the super creative Sharon
   McSwiney
   [IMG_1830.JPG]
   People arrived throughout the week, directed to the studio in the
   garden which
   [IMG_1866.JPG]
   had been tweeked and pampered to create a lush jungle of plants. Much
   enjoyed and a relief to those who were not so keen to look at art.
   [IMG_1832.JPG]
   Completely given over to showing work, my shed had been sorted over 3
   days.
   [IMG_1833.JPG]
   [IMG_1834.JPG]
   [IMG_1839.JPG]
   My lounge was made into a serene art gallery.
   [IMG_1840.JPG]
   Textiles
   [IMG_1844.JPG]
   prints and enamels.
   [IMG_1845.JPG]
   Fantasy objects
   [IMG_1846.JPG]
   Metal work and
   [IMG_1848.JPG]
   Jewellery
   [IMG_1850.JPG]
   Caroline's exquisite objects, beautifully made and
   [IMG_1852.JPG]
   wonderfully painted.
   [IMG_1887.JPG]
   After 9 days of talking, listening to incredible stories and sharing
   our thoughts and despite the rain...thank you to everyone who ventured
   through my front door and up the garden path to my shed. All 627 of
   you!!

WITH A WEEK TO GO

    Where exactly did 2 years go?
   Yes it is 2 years since I last opened the doors to both my house and
   garden and the yard:ARTspace for the biannual  Cheltenham Open
   Studios.Starting 8 June, Commercial Street will be open 10-4pm until
   the 16 June.
   [Commercial%2Bstreet.JPG]
   I am just one of 200 artists taking part this year and Commercial
   Street is one of  79 venues exhibiting and opening up their creative
   work spaces.
   So what goes into planning and delivering such an event?
   [IMG_1809.JPG]
   So a month before it all kicks off the lovely Mr Brown and I start to
   tidy the garden as it has to be walked through to get to my shed.There
   are a few people who come to my Open Studio just to see how the garden
   is getting on.
   [IMG_1811.JPG]
   So I don't like to disappoint. A bit like Chelsea Flower Show it is
   touch and go for things in flower. The foxglove may have peaked too
   soon! That is where the comparison ends.
   [IMG_1812.JPG]
   But this rose by my shed will be in full scented glory.
   [IMG_1816.JPG]
   Apart from the tidying of the shed, house, garden and the yard:ARTspace
   and all the hanging of work, there is all the signage to sort out. I
   want you to find venue 32 & 33 with ease together with the other
   artists in the Suffolk area. So arrows and an area walking map have to
   be produced.
   [IMG_1817.JPG]
   My shed is almost ready, you will be able to flick through my sketch
   books.
   [IMG_1818.JPG]
   There will be a few bargains to find next to my current work.
   [IMG_1819.JPG]
   I will be working in the shed over the week so come along and talk
   about printmaking. You might like to discuss which workshop will unlock
   your creativity?
   [IMG_1821.JPG]
   Back in the house I am trying to create a gallery feel with my enamel
   work.
   [IMG_1826.JPG]
   Come early to snap these up, I do not have many figures left.
   [IMG_1827.JPG]
   My collagraphs will be available, framed and unframed.
   [IMG_1829.JPG]
   I have new printed textile pieces, this work
   [IMG_1828.JPG]
   is only available from me as it is not presently in galleries.
   [Goldfinch-acer-metalwork.jpg]
   This is just a small taster. There will be more work to see as once
   again I am joined by two very talented artists. Sharon McSwiney will be
   showing her jewelry and metal work and
   [ang%2B10.JPG]
   Caroline McCatty will exhibit puppets and automaton
   [IMG_1801.JPG]
   Can't wait for Saturday 8 June?
   I would like to invite you to our preview evening,
   Thursday, 6 June 6-8pm
   Join us for a drink and an early look around the work before we open in
   earnest on 8 June.
