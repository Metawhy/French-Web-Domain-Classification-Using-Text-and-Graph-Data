Introduction

   SimilarTech Ltd. and SimilarTech Inc. (collectively "SimilarTech" or
   "Company" or "we" or "us" or "our") is the sole owner of an analysis
   tool which enables its business partners or potential clients to
   receive insights (i.e., market research, trends, leads, etc.) to
   leverage and grow their businesses ("Platform"). SimilarTech interacts
   with current and prospective clients and the general public via its
   Website, available at: https://www.similartech.com ("Website") or
   Service. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes our practices
   of processing data from visitors to the Website or from our clients and
   partners ("Business Partners") once they register to receive our API,
   analytic data, insights and filtered dashboard tool (all, collectively
   the "Service").
   For more details regarding the terms and conditions of our Services and
   Platform, please read our Terms of Use, available at:
   https://www.similartech.com/terms. Note that, this Privacy Policy is an
   integral part of the Terms of Use (collectively the "Agreement").
   We have included below information about which data is collected, how
   we process and use your data, but before we would like to explain the
   basis on which we do so:
    1. Where you sign up for any of our services, we process your personal
       data in order to perform our contract with you;
    2. If we have a legitimate interest in processing data, such as for
       direct marketing or online identifiers when you access our Website;
       or
    3. We will also process your personal data where you have provided us
       with consent to do so.

What Type of Information We Collect

   Depending on your interaction with us (meaning, if you are just
   browsing our Website, or if you have registered to our Services and
   opened an account, etc.), we may collect two types of information you,
   as follows:
     * Non-Personal Data: The first type of information is
       non-identifiable information which may be made available or
       gathered through your use of the Services. To clarify, we are not
       aware of your identity due to such information ("Non-Personal
       Information"). The Non-Personal Information which is being
       collected may include your aggregated usage information and
       technical information transmitted or automatically collected such
       as (but not limited to): the time and date you access our Website,
       your actions within our Services (e.g., registration, pages viewed,
       etc.) and approximate geo-location (country level).
     * Personal Data: The second type of information is individually
       identifiable information, namely information that identifies an
       individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual
       ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes either: (i)
       contact information such as your name, email address, etc., which
       you have submitted voluntarily; or (ii) your Internet Protocol
       ("IP") addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet). Note
       that, while IP is considered personally identifiable information in
       many jurisdictions (such as the EEA), there are some jurisdictions
       in which such data is not considered as Personal Information.
       Therefore, we treat such information as Personal Information, in
       accordance with applicable laws, however we do not attempt to
       analyze or determine your identity based on such information or
       otherwise combine it with any Personal Information such as your
       name or email address. The IP is collected by our third party
       analytic partners that offer ways to opt-out, all as detailed
       below.

   You are not required by law to provide us with any information. You can
   always avoid from providing us certain Personal Information; however,
   you acknowledge that it may prevent you from engaging in certain
   Services. For example, if you are a Business Partner, we will not be
   able to provide you with access to the Platform if you do not provide
   us with the information required through the registration process. In
   the event we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal
   Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal
   Information for as long as it remains combined.
