Our mission

   Since 2013, Bpifrance has become the one stop shop for entrepreneurs
   with a vastly comprehensive toolbox offered in the field to customers
   through 50 local branches. Our mission is simple: we believe in serving
   the future, by being entrepreneur-centric and heavily decentralized.

The one stop shop for entrepreneurs

   Bpifranceâ€™s goal is to favour the growth of the French economy by
   helping entrepreneurs thrive. We are the trusted partner of
   entrepreneurs and champion the interests of those who are visionaries;
   those who dare to take risks in order to take their businesses further.
   We have many resources at our disposal to help entrepreneurs, the
   champions of the 21st century, succeed. We mainly support
   micro-businesses, SMEs and mid-caps but we also accompany large caps
   that are considered important to the interests of France in terms of
   national economy, the territories or employment. We offer a continuum
   of solutions adapted to every key step in a businessâ€™ growth such as:
   business creation, financing, guarantees or equity investment.

   We are also the French agency for innovation, delivering massive
   programs to innovative entrepreneurs. To put it simply: Bpifrance is a
   financial institution, with private culture, serving the collective
   interest. Our values are determination / optimism / proximity /
   simplicity and also performance: we generate significant returns to our
   shareholders.

Bpifrance: more than just a bank

   We also coach entrepreneurs to help their businesses succeed. Indeed,
   entrepreneurship is akin to competitive sport and we want to help them
   win! We finance innovators and accelerators for start ups, but also for
   small caps and mid-caps in order to help those who are impatient and
   want to grow as quickly as possible. The number of our accelerators is
   increasing so watch this space! At the beginning of 2019, 25 SME
   accelerator programs were launched and the goal is to accelerate 4000
   companies by 2021.

   It is extremely important to us to create an ecosystem that favours
   entrepreneurship, which is why we also organise events in France and
   abroad to allow entrepreneurs to exchange best practices and find new
   partners. We find that these events encourage our entrepreneurs to be
   open with their needs and foster business amongst each other. Every
   year, we gather 45.000 entrepreneurs at our event, the BIG, held in the
   Paris stadium AccorHotels Arena.

Helping entrepreneurs conquer the world

   With the right support and a vast network, French entrepreneurs can
   have worldwide ambitions. We strongly believe that exporting and
   international expansion is key to a companyâ€™s growth, be it a start up
   or a midsize company. We help companies conquer new territories through
   a wide range of products such as export credit, non guaranteed
   loans,and we became the French Export Credit Agency in 2017. But we
   donâ€™t stop there. Bpifrance organises over 30 learning expeditions per
   year all over the world so that entrepreneurs can discover new markets
   and meet with experts and potential buyers and investors. We also work
   with an array of expats all over the world that are able to give
   insider knowledge and help businesses grow exponentially.

   Bpifrance is doing its upmost to galvanize the French economy but donâ€™t
   just take our word for it, have a look on the rest of our website to
   find out more.
