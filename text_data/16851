A 1-2-3 for ERC champions in Germany

   Richard Rodgers2016-08-21T00:00:00+02:00August 21st, 2016|2015|

   Three former FIA European Rally Champions locked out the podium after
   battling for class victory on ADAC Rallye Deutschland.

   The WRC2 category win went to 2014 ERC champion Esapekka Lappi – a
   second victory in a row for the rising Finnish star after his home
   triumph last month. It was the first time he has won the category on
   asphalt, but he has previously proved his sealed surface ability during
   his ERC stint with wins on the Circuit of Ireland and in Valais.

   ŠKODA team-mate Jan Kopecký, the 2013 ERC champion, recovered to finish
   in second after losing time with tyre damage on the opening morning of
   the rally. Unable to defend his category win on the Trier event from
   2015, the Czech ace will hope to successfully defend his Barum Czech
   Rally Zlín crown on round eight of the ERC next week.

   Completing the podium in another ŠKODA was local expert Armin Kremer,
   who led Lappi earlier in the event. Kremer actually won ADAC Rallye
   Deutschland in 1999 when it was part of the ERC, which he won outright
   two years later.

   The 2014 ERC Junior champion Stéphane Lefebvre continued his programme
   in a Citroën DS3 WRC, but he and co-driver Gabin Moreau were both
   injured when they crashed at high speed on Saturday. Organisers say
   they suffered ‘fractures and internal injuries’ and they remain in
   hospital. The ERC would like to wish Stéphane (who returned to the ERC
   to fight for outright victory in Ypres in June) and Gabin (co-driver to
   ERC Junior driver Chris Ingram in 2014-15) a quick and full recovery.

Watch ERC ace Habaj being a hero at home

   Richard Rodgers2019-09-10T17:08:48+02:00September 11th, 2019|2019,
   Cyprus Rally|

   Łukasz Habaj switched from four- to two-wheel drive when he contested
   his home event, the Polish championship-counting Rajd Śląska, last
   weekend.

   Habaj, a winner in this season’s FIA European Rally Championship
   rekindled old memories from his early career by swapping his ŠKODA
   Fabia R5 for a Fiat Seicento Abarth.

   “If you had such a cute little kit car in your garage and a home rally
   with special stages 1000 metres from your home wouldn’t you
   participate?” said Habaj. “It was just for pure fun and of course a
   great training for me [because it’s a] very demanding car to drive. We
   dragged a lot of media and spectator attention and hope we gave them a
   lot of positive emotions.”

   Onboard camera footage of Habaj competing on his Fiat on Rajd Śląska is
   available by clicking here.

   Find out more from Habaj ahead of the Cyprus Rally, where he will form
   part of a three-way title fight, by visiting FIAERC.com.
