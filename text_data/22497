What is Flip (FLP)

   GameFlip FLIP is an Ethereum-based platform, with its FLIP token
   crafted specifically for gamers. Backed by the founders of Electronic
   Arts, GREE, and BigPoint, FLIP is designed to operate as the smart
   contracts necessary to facilitate the trading of in-game items and
   assets among gamers.
   Blockchains provide unique digital property capabilities, such as
   verifiable ownership and reduced transaction costs, making them optimal
   medium for gamers to exchange virtual assets. FLIP is designed to
   facilitate the transfer of such assets.

Flip (FLP) features

   FLIP is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that serves the role of a medium of
   exchange for trading virtual items amongst gamers. Blockchains create
   unique situations of verifiable scarcity, ownership, and
   interoperability among in-game assets but require the framework for
   these assets to trade in liquid environments.
   Founded in December 2014, GameFlip offers an open-source SDK for
   developers along with a marketplace for gamers to exchange virtual
   in-game assets like skins -- popular with games like Fortnite.
   Currently, GameFlip is working on a Beta version of its self-publishing
   game platform, which will include an optimized escrow system for
   exchanging in-game assets.
   The potential of blockchain gaming is vast, and GameFlip is striving to
   capture the value that inherently resides in a blossoming esports and
   gaming industry.
   Marketplaces for securely exchanging digital assets with minimal fees
   and actual ownership are envisioned as the inevitable future of gaming,
   and GameFlip is placing the FLIP token as the primary incentive and
   payment mechanism within its digital marketplace.
   The FLIP token has a capped supply of 100 million, and a current
   circulating supply of roughly 60 million. The FLIP marketplaces
   encompass in-game items, games, gigs, and more for multiple gaming
   platforms including Xbox, Playstation, and the popular Steam
   marketplace.

What is ZClassic (ZLC)

   ZClassic is a public cryptocurrency network that utilizes an
   implementation of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to achieve enhanced
   privacy features on its ledger. A fork of ZCash, ZClassic split from
   ZCash over differences centering on the 20 percent founder’s reward for
   each block allocated to the ZCash team.
   ZClassic removes the founders reward, enabling miners to earn 100
   percent of the block reward. ZClassic also has some unique properties
   that distinguish it from other ZKP-based cryptocurrencies, including
   removing the slow start in mining used in ZCash.

   zclassic-plain

ZClassic (ZLC) features

   ZClassic is a proof-of-work (PoW), UTXO cryptocurrency with advanced
   privacy assurances resulting from its implementation of ZKPs. ZClassic
   is very similar to ZCash, but removed the founder’s reward and slow
   start (~20k blocks) from the ZCash mining ecosystem.
   ZClassic is fundamentally the same as ZCash in all other aspects,
   including the use of the parameters for the trusted setup and the
   integration of the Sapling Upgrade, which makes ZKP transactions more
   efficient.
   In ZCash, 20 percent of the mined coins per block go to Zero Coin Inc,
   the company that founded and oversees the protocol. ZClassic split from
   ZCash explicitly because their disagreement with the high costs taken
   from miners by the firm. In addition, ZCash selected the Equihash
   mining algorithm for its ASIC-resistance, and removed the slow start
   component of ZCash to protect smaller miners and even out the
   distribution of the coins in the network over time.
   Like ZCash, ZClassic has some of the most advanced privacy assurances
   among cryptocurrencies. ZKPs, specifically zk-SNARKs, are widely viewed
   as providing extreme levels of privacy, where all links between
   senders, recipients, and transaction amounts are severed.
   The ZCL coins are capped at a total supply of 21 million, deriving from
   Bitcoin’s supply schedule and block-reward halving schedule.

What is Binance Coin (BNB)

   Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of cryptocurrency
   exchange behemoth, Binance, which currently runs on its Binance Chain
   blockchain. Issued during Binance’s July 2017 ICO for BNB, the coin
   serves multiple utility purposes on the Binance exchange and was
   initially established with a total supply of 200 million.

   binancecoin-plain

Binance Coin (BNB) features

   BNB has become one of the best performing cryptocurrencies since its
   launch, surging from an issuance price of $0.15 during the ICO to its
   current position of more than $20.
   Every fiscal quarter, Binance burns (i.e., destroys) an amount of BNB
   that correlates to the quarterly profit of its exchange platform.
   Burning of the BNB token will continue until 50 percent (~ 100 million)
   of the initial supply is terminated.
   The current circulating supply of BNB is slightly more than 141 million
   at the time of this writing.

The Multiple Utilities of BNB

   The BNB coin factors into a significant portion of Binance’s enormous
   success as a crypto-to-crypto exchange platform and has been attributed
   by many observers as one of its most prudent business moves. Binance
   consistently remains among the largest exchanges by adjusted trading
   volume, in large part fueled by the incentive design of the BNB coin.
   The primary utility cases of BNB include:
   - Reduced fees on trading, listing, and other fees when paid directly
   in BNB.
   - BNB is a crucial base asset and functions as ‘gas’ on the new Binance
   DEX.
   - Increasing ROI from BNB quarterly burns and rebate via trading fees.
   Importantly, on the Binance exchange platform, trading fee rebates via
   BNB diminish on a yearly basis according to the following schedule:
   - 1st year -- 50 percent
   - 2nd year - 25 percent
   - 3rd year - 12.5 percent
   - 4th year - 6.75 percent
   - 5th year - No discount
   Binance officially migrated the BNB token, which was originally an
   ERC-20 token on Ethereum, to its native Binance Chain on April 23rd,
   2019. Binance no longer supports the withdrawal of ERC-20 BNB tokens on
   the exchange, but continues to support the token swap from ERC-20 token
   to the Binance native chain. Binance Chain BNB tokens fall under the
   BEP-2 token standard for the blockchain.
   Binance Chain is explicitly designed as a high-performance trading
   engine, with its DEX as the centerpiece of the new model, which does
   not take control of user assets.

Binance Chain and The Future of BNB

   Binance, led by CEO ChangPeng Zhao (aka CZ), initially was domiciled in
   Hong Kong before moving into the crypto-friendly haven of Malta in
   2018. Notably, Binance does not list fiat currency pairs and has
   instead relied on a combination of cryptocurrency base pairs, including
   its BNB token, as well as stablecoins such as Tether (USDT).
   With the transition of BNB to the Binance Chain, BNB is poised to play
   a significant role in the Binance DEX as its gas. Wallets that will be
   supported by the DEX out of the gate include Ledger, TrustWallet,
   Enjin, Coinomi Wallet, and more.
   Full control over their own assets is rapidly becoming a dominant trend
   among mainstream cryptocurrency users as they begin to better
   understand the gravity of the phrase -- ‘not your keys, not your
   Bitcoin.’
   DEXs have failed to gain meaningful volume thus far, but Binance’s BNB
   token may end up playing a prominent role in sparking the further
   adoption of the Binance DEX where users control the keys to their
   crypto assets.

What is Life (LIFE)

   Life is an Ethereum-based platform designed to supplement philanthropic
   initiatives around the globe. The LIFE token is designed as digital
   cash to operate within a consumer reward program involving businesses,
   communities, non-profits, and other organizations.
   Life is a “platform-as-a-service” blockchain with the goal of
   supporting philanthropic causes including Senditoo and Lemonstorm.

Life (LIFE) features

   LIFE is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum crafted to be a digital cash, and
   is compatible with Life wallet and debit card. The Life digital wallet
   can store other assets like BTC and ETH, and is integrated with the
   Life pre-paid card for crypto-based payments.
   Life Labs partners with charitable organizations and businesses to use
   the LIFE token and wallet in their efforts around the world. Payments
   using Life do not have intermediaries, and consequently, high
   transaction costs, and can be settled rapidly -- making their wallet
   ideal for quick philanthropic funding and payments.
   Among some of Life’s major adopters are Senditoo, Lemonstorm, and
   fuudel. Senditoo is a remittance service for sending money home to
   relatives from foreign countries, Lemonstorm is an e-commerce platform
   that oversees major brands like the Discovery Channel, and fuudel is
   analogous to UberEats.
   These adopters tap LIFE token and the blockchain
   “platform-as-a-service” for low-cost payments and charitable
   initiatives. There is a capped supply of 100 billion LIFE tokens, with
   roughly 23.4 billion currently in circulation.

What is Cosmos (ATOM)

   Dubbed ‘The Internet of Blockchains,’ Cosmos Network is a
   next-generation public blockchain at the convergence of scalability and
   interoperability. Cosmos is based on a blockchain engine called
   ‘Tendermint,’ and is generally a hub-and-spoke model for other
   blockchains to plug into -- facilitating interoperability of assets and
   better scalability.

Cosmos (ATOM) features

   The network recently launched its inaugural mainnet -- the Cosmos Hub
   -- bootstrapping a full implementation of a proof-of-stake (PoS)
   consensus network.
   Cosmos raised $17.3 million in its April 2017 ICO for its native token
   ATOM, which is used in the validation process of blocks in the staking
   consensus and network governance.

Multi-Chain Framework Design and Interoperability

   Cosmos is based on a modular framework for connecting different
   blockchains within a standardized protocol. The recently launched
   ‘Cosmos Hub’ is the central hub of the hub-and-spoke model, with other
   blockchains functioning as ‘zones’ that are all attached via the
   network’s unique Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
   Tendermint is the underlying technology behind Cosmos, and we can break
   it down into two primary components:
   1. The Proof-of-Stake Consensus Engine
   2. Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI)
   Tendermint core is the underlying consensus mechanism of Cosmos and is
   a PoS network. Networks that plug into Cosmos can trivially exchange
   assets native to each others’ chains using the IBC, and they do not
   have to forfeit their own consensus mechanisms.
   The Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI) is layered on top of
   Tendermint and is a programming language-agnostic boundary between the
   developer SDK for the network and the complex Tendermint Core. The IBC
   is contained within the ABCI layer. Developers can build applications
   on top of ABCI with the Cosmos SDK in the programming language of their
   choice.
   Cosmos is scalable because it is a PoS system and independent networks
   retain their own consensus when plugged into Cosmos. Different
   blockchains seamlessly exchange value with each other, and much of the
   processing capacity of transactions is off-loaded between hubs.
   Separating the most salient elements of Cosmos we find:
   1. Tendermint
   2. Cosmos SDK
   3. IBC
   Tendermint enables different blockchains to plug into Cosmos while the
   network remains sovereign in its consensus. It is a PoS design and
   works well with other PoS blockchains wishing to join the ecosystem.
   The Cosmos SDK is an abundant resource framework for building
   applications on Cosmos.
   The IBC is the standardized protocol that allows the different
   blockchains in Cosmos to communicate and transfer value with each
   other.

The ATOM Token, Governance, and Future Direction

   The ATOM token is the native token used for staking and governance in
   the Cosmos network. In April, the Cosmos community initiated Phase 2 of
   the network’s mainnet with a proposal voted and approved that enabled
   the transfer of ATOM tokens in the network.
   Governance in the Cosmos Hub follows and on-chain model where
   delegators and validators -- both ATOM holders -- vote on proposals
   that determine the future of the network.
   Cosmos recently launched the Lunie Wallet, which can be used by users,
   delegators, and validators to store and transfer ATOM tokens. There are
   currently more than 190 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a total
   supply of nearly 238 million.
   Moving forward, the larger goal of Cosmos is to have numerous
   blockchains gravitate towards its ecosystem. The network wants to solve
   the siloed nature of public and private blockchains, enabling them to
   scale and expedite innovation via their collaboration.
   Cosmos also is actively working on a bridge to Ethereum called
   ‘Ethermint,’ which is compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine. This
   means that developers can actually port smart contracts and
   decentralized applications over to the Cosmos network from Ethereum.
   Among a new wave of blockchains focusing on scalability and
   interoperability, Cosmos is rapidly gathering a growing development
   community and application ecosystem.
