Like Fish Out of Water

     May 17th, 1901

     Matt Quay, William Jennings Bryan, and Richard Pettigrew as fish
     emerge onto the shore from the ocean of politics.

     The caption reads “A fish story that is hard to believe.”

     According to the New York Times, Quay, a Senator from Pennsylvania,
     had vowed that he would not again run for any elected office. Bryan,
     a two time presidential candidate, and Pettigrew, a former Senator
     from South Dakota, had previously made similar statements.

     The Political Janus: It All Depends on the Way You Look at Him, an
     illustration by Australian satirist Frank A. Nankivell for Puck
     magazine, 1910. Former American President Theodore Roosevelt is
     rendered as a polarizing political figure, a simultaneous “savoir”
     and “menace.”

Anonymous asked:

     Did Truman ever meet or know of Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Elder
     Bush?

   deadpresidents:

     Ford was a Congressman when Truman was President and the House
     Minority Leader for several years before Truman died. I don’t know
     how many times they met or how in-depth their meetings were, but
     they did meet and Truman certainly knew who Ford was. Here’s a photo
     from a bill-signing event during JFK’s Presidency with former
     President Truman and Ford among the group in the Oval Office
     together.

     Truman and Carter never met (Carter never met LBJ, either), and I
     don’t know if Truman knew who Carter was. Truman died in 1972, about
     a year into Carter’s term as Governor of Georgia, but Carter wasn’t
     a national figure until a few months into his 1976 campaign for
     President. I’m not sure how plugged into Democratic politics Truman
     was during the last two years of his life, so it’s certainly
     possible that Carter may have been on his radar as a different kind
     of Southern Democrat, but I just don’t know for sure.

     Don’t forget that Ronald Reagan was a very famous actor when Harry
     Truman was President. Truman probably would have known about Reagan
     just from Reagan being a pretty big movie star. But Reagan was also
     a Democrat (yes, Ronald Reagan was a Democrat) during the Truman
     Administration, and he (along with Lauren Bacall and Humphrey
     Bogart) campaigned for – and WITH – President Truman in 1948:
     image

     I’m not sure about George H.W. Bush and Truman. Bush’s father,
     Prescott Bush, was elected to the U.S. Senate while Truman was still
     President, and Bush 41 himself served in Congress and as U.S.
     Ambassador to the United Nations while Truman was still alive. I
     wouldn’t be surprised if they had met at some point, but it probably
     wasn’t anything extensive. If I had to guess, I’d say that Truman
     probably knew who George H.W. Bush was because he was familiar with
     Senator Bush. Even an elderly Truman would probably have been aware
     of who the U.N. Ambassador was towards the end of his life.
