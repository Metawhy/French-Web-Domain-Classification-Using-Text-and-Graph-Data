Parliament calls for stricter controls over surveillance tech exports

   The European Parliament gave the green light on Tuesday (8 September)
   to a non-binding resolution calling for safeguards to ensure technology
   isn’t implicated in human rights abuse, especially when it’s exported
   outside of Europe for surveillance or censorship purposes. A European
   Commission proposal is expected next year.

   Yesterday’s vote came two months after it was first scheduled. In July,
   Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake (Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for
   Europe), the author of the own initiative report, asked to have the
   vote postponed at short notice.

   Schaake told EURACTIV at the time that she didn’t have the support to
   bring the report to plenary.

   The surveillance report finally faced the first plenary session after
   the summer break and was approved with 371 votes in favour, 293 against
   and 43 abstentions yesterday afternoon in Strasbourg.

   MEPs approved the entire text, but Schaake said her report is still a
   lightening rod for criticism. A number of lawmakers, especially from
   the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and Conservatives and
   Reformist (ECR) groups in Parliament, disagree with her position on
   Europe’s complicity in surveillance.

   “Unfortunately there are still quite a few people who see security and
   human rights as zero-sum,” Schaake told EURACTIV.

   “The conservative side of the European Parliament did not want to
   condemn the role EU-based companies play, and also did not support the
   text that emphasized the need for strong encryption in the interest of
   securing data and the people communicating,” the lawmaker said.

   Checks on software

   The report spells out recommendations to make sure technology isn’t
   used in or outside Europe to abuse human rights. Institutions should
   issue checks on exports of software that can be used for surveillance
   or to censor or block internet activity, the report recommends.

   Schaake’s report calls for safeguards to encryption technology, which
   have come under fire from British Prime Minister David Cameron, and
   other officials, who call privacy techniques that leave no backdoor for
   law enforcement a threat to security.

   plan

   The report also says EU member states’ cooperation with US surveillance
   agencies to spy on citizens “has caused serious damage to the
   credibility of the EU’s human rights policy and has undermined global
   trust in the benefits of ICTs”.

   “The credibility of Europe’s foreign policy is undermined directly when
   an Italian company unjustly gets a license to sell to Sudan or Russia
   or when a French company sells digital keys to open any door, even the
   ones we may think are protected or locked by passwords or much stronger
   measures,” Schaake said during Monday’s debate in Strasbourg.

   Milan-based company Hacking Team was itself the victim of hacking in
   July, when invoices and internal emails were leaked, showing the firm’s
   sales of software that can be used for surveillance to countries such
   as Sudan, Russia and Turkey.

   Some EU member states also purchased software from Hacking Team,
   leading to the resignation of Maltese intelligence agency chief Andreas
   Pentaras in July.

   Dual use technology

   Earlier this summer, Schaake told EURACTIV that there should be EU-wide
   rules on export licences.

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation this year,
   which sets out rules for the export of products that can potentially be
   used for military purposes.

   German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel signed off on a national
   law in July instituting stricter export controls for surveillance
   technology. Gabriel has been pushing for EU-wide laws to limit the
   export on dual use technology.

   controls

   “In addition to country-specific sanctions, the European Union is
   reviewing its export controls to prevent exports of sensitive
   technologies that could be misused in violation of human rights,”
   Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said during Monday’s debate.

   Timmermans was in Strasbourg for a Commissioners’ college meeting on
   the sidelines of the plenary session.

   Commission proposal due next year

   “We’ve introduced in December 2014 new controls on exports of intrusion
   software and internet monitoring technologies. We are further exploring
   options to extend export controls to rapidly evolving cybersurveillance
   technologies that might be used for internet monitoring and/or
   telecommunications surveillance in violation of human rights,” he
   added.

   Schaake said many of the Commission’s measures to control the export of
   surveillance technology needed prodding from the Parliament.

   “There is still a huge amount of work that needs to be done before the
   EU has the relevant policies in place to deal with both the
   opportunities and the risks that are caused by the availability of new
   technologies,” she said.

   “A proposal for new legislation is now finally expected at the start of
   2016, which is welcome, but still long overdue. It will always prove
   difficult to make sure that the legislative process keeps up with
   technological developments, especially when it regards the internet,
   but on this issue it is safe to say that we are seriously lagging
   behind.”

Background

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation, which
   lays down the legislative framework for the export of products that can
   be used as weapons. A vote on a report by Dutch Liberal MEP Marietje
   Schaake on export controls for surveillance technology was postponed
   from July until September 2015.

   The quiet rise of Ursula von der Leyen

   German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, a compromise name for the
   next  European Commission President, is a non-divisive political figure
   on EU stage and quiet tactician hardly known outside Germany. But her
   career at home has often been marked by scandals.

   EU leaders agree on top job picks but trouble already looms

   The European Council finally agreed on a pick for the Commission
   presidency and rallied behind Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday
   (2 July). But it sets up a potentially ugly encounter with the European
   Parliament, which might not sanction her appointment.

   Europe’s complicity in surveillance.

   “Unfortunately there are still quite a few people who see security and
   human rights as zero-sum,” Schaake told EURACTIV.

   “The conservative side of the European Parliament did not want to
   condemn the role EU-based companies play, and also did not support the
   text that emphasized the need for strong encryption in the interest of
   securing data and the people communicating,” the lawmaker said.

   Checks on software

   The report spells out recommendations to make sure technology isn’t
   used in or outside Europe to abuse human rights. Institutions should
   issue checks on exports of software that can be used for surveillance
   or to censor or block internet activity, the report recommends.

   Schaake’s report calls for safeguards to encryption technology, which
   have come under fire from British Prime Minister David Cameron, and
   other officials, who call privacy techniques that leave no backdoor for
   law enforcement a threat to security.

   plan

   The report also says EU member states’ cooperation with US surveillance
   agencies to spy on citizens “has caused serious damage to the
   credibility of the EU’s human rights policy and has undermined global
   trust in the benefits of ICTs”.

   “The credibility of Europe’s foreign policy is undermined directly when
   an Italian company unjustly gets a license to sell to Sudan or Russia
   or when a French company sells digital keys to open any door, even the
   ones we may think are protected or locked by passwords or much stronger
   measures,” Schaake said during Monday’s debate in Strasbourg.

   Milan-based company Hacking Team was itself the victim of hacking in
   July, when invoices and internal emails were leaked, showing the firm’s
   sales of software that can be used for surveillance to countries such
   as Sudan, Russia and Turkey.

   Some EU member states also purchased software from Hacking Team,
   leading to the resignation of Maltese intelligence agency chief Andreas
   Pentaras in July.

   Dual use technology

   Earlier this summer, Schaake told EURACTIV that there should be EU-wide
   rules on export licences.

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation this year,
   which sets out rules for the export of products that can potentially be
   used for military purposes.

   German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel signed off on a national
   law in July instituting stricter export controls for surveillance
   technology. Gabriel has been pushing for EU-wide laws to limit the
   export on dual use technology.

   controls

   “In addition to country-specific sanctions, the European Union is
   reviewing its export controls to prevent exports of sensitive
   technologies that could be misused in violation of human rights,”
   Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said during Monday’s debate.

   Timmermans was in Strasbourg for a Commissioners’ college meeting on
   the sidelines of the plenary session.

   Commission proposal due next year

   “We’ve introduced in December 2014 new controls on exports of intrusion
   software and internet monitoring technologies. We are further exploring
   options to extend export controls to rapidly evolving cybersurveillance
   technologies that might be used for internet monitoring and/or
   telecommunications surveillance in violation of human rights,” he
   added.

   Schaake said many of the Commission’s measures to control the export of
   surveillance technology needed prodding from the Parliament.

   “There is still a huge amount of work that needs to be done before the
   EU has the relevant policies in place to deal with both the
   opportunities and the risks that are caused by the availability of new
   technologies,” she said.

   “A proposal for new legislation is now finally expected at the start of
   2016, which is welcome, but still long overdue. It will always prove
   difficult to make sure that the legislative process keeps up with
   technological developments, especially when it regards the internet,
   but on this issue it is safe to say that we are seriously lagging
   behind.”

Background

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation, which
   lays down the legislative framework for the export of products that can
   be used as weapons. A vote on a report by Dutch Liberal MEP Marietje
   Schaake on export controls for surveillance technology was postponed
   from July until September 2015.

Waste: Subsidies make it cheaper to burn than recycle

   Comments Print

   Burning waste for energy undermines Europe’s recycling efforts by
   diverting waste to incinerators instead of having it reused or
   recycled, thereby defeating the purpose of the Commission’s well-meant
   directive on minimising waste.

   Republishing a corrected version.

   “Closing the loop”

   In 2015, the Commission launched an initiative on the circular economy,
   titled “Closing the loop”. The objective was to minimise waste and
   extend the value of products and resources for as long as possible.

   A waste hierarchy was devised, in which reducing, reusing and recycling
   waste sit at the top – and incineration is just above landfill. In
   other words, nothing that could be recycled or composted should be
   burnt.

   This tallies with the EU’s recycling target, agreed in 2008, to recycle
   50% of all municipal waste by 2020.

   But waste can also be burnt to create heat or electricity, a process
   known as “waste to energy” (WtE). And as the organic fraction of waste
   is considered a renewable resource, it is eligible for state subsidies
   under the EU’s current renewable energy scheme. Countries are trying to
   make the most of the subsidies, often bending the rules.

   Waste shortages

   Subsidies encouraged investment into incineration plants. According to
   a 2017 report by the European Environment Agency, member states
   including Sweden, Denmark and Estonia have reached incineration
   overcapacity – in other words, they have a waste shortage.

   In an ideal scenario where 65% of waste is recycled, France, Germany,
   Austria and the Benelux countries also produce less waste than what
   they need.

   Effectively, this over-capacity puts a cap on recycling: a recent study
   shows that with the incinerators existing in 2011, the UK could have
   recycled 77% of its waste.

   But building new capacity led to a paradoxical situation: if all plants
   are to be used, by 2030 recycling will be capped at 63%, simply because
   there is not enough waste.

   This is not a hypothetical scenario. The trade-off between waste
   recycling vs. burning is already happening in some countries, Eurostat
   data shows. The Commission called on member states earlier this year to
   phase-out subsidies to WtE to avoid subverting recycling targets and
   the waste hierarchy.

   But despite a decline in WtE across the bloc (-3,2% in 2015 compared to
   the previous year), a number of eastern countries (including Slovenia,
   Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia and Slovakia) but also
   the UK, Austria and Sweden, are burning waste at increasing rates.

   “If the incorrect application of RED distorts the waste economy and
   hierarchy, away from recycling and towards incineration, we will get to
   2020 and still be far from EU recycling targets of 50%. The fear is
   that member states will review their recycling ambitions
   downwards,” Enzo Favoino, scientific director of campaign group Zero
   Waste Europe, told EURACTIV.com.

   What is more worrying, in some cases the recycling trend has reversed –
   as in Bulgaria (-15,4% in 2015 compared to 2014) and Estonia (-6,4%) –
   or stagnated,  like in Sweden and the UK. All four countries have, over
   the same period, increased the rate at which they burn waste.

   Waste trade

   Wherever there is a demand, there will be a supply. This is how waste
   became a commodity: imports of municipal mixed waste grew
   fivefold after the introduction of waste-to-energy subsidies.

   Because waste has become a traded good, it cannot face barriers to
   trade. The market decides the price and waste flocks to countries with
   relatively larger disposal capacity, where it is burnt in subsidised
   plants.

   Unsurprisingly, the biggest importers of waste are Germany, Sweden, the
   Netherlands, Estonia and Belgium – all countries  with a high
   incineration capacity according to the European Environment Agency.

   Waste exporters also include net importers Germany and Austria,
   defeating the EU’s “proximity principle” (Article 16 of the Waste
   Management Directive), according to which waste should be disposed of
   as close as possible to where it is produced.

   Cheating on bin contents

   Under the EU’s directive on renewable energy, only a certain part of
   mixed waste is considered eligible for “renewable” electricity
   subsidies, and that is biomass. This is the kitchen and garden waste
   that ends in the mixed waste bin (currently, there are no compulsory EU
   rules on collecting organic waste although some member states have
   implemented their own initiatives).

   It is up to countries to decide what percentage of their mixed waste is
   made of biomass, but there is no uniform rule on how to do this.
   Countries like the Netherlands measure the average bin content
   and publish every year an official waste percentage eligible for state
   subsidies.

   Most countries arbitrarily set this at 50% (France, Italy, the UK).
   Others, like Estonia, do not disclose their subsidised percentage of
   organic waste because, they say, it is a “trade secret”.

   NGO European Compost Network estimates this percentage is closer to
   40%, although it depends on the season and geography.

   Nonetheless, according to calculations by NGO Zero Waste Europe, a
   number of incinerators across Europe receive subsidises for all the
   waste they burn, and not just the renewable component – this includes
   plastics, paper and cardboard that could be recycled (and have a higher
   negative impact on environment and health).

   The Zabalgarbi incinerator in Bilbao, Spain, is cheating with RED
   subsidies according to Gorka Bueno Mendieta, professor of engineering
   at the Basque Country University.

   “Although less than 20% of the electricity generated is of renewable
   origin […] every megawatt generated in Zabalgarbi is rewarded with

EU warned against renewables law ‘subverting’ the circular economy

   Lawmakers in the European Parliament will next month examine a draft
   renewable energy bill that recycling industries warn would allow EU
   countries to count the burning of biowaste towards their green energy
   obligations, undermining separate efforts to boost recycling.

Positions

   Zero Waste Europe:

   To date, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) has been one of the key
   obstacles to the achievement
   of progressive goals of EU waste legislation. This is due to the
   financial incentives provided to energy
   generated from waste which disincentives other more environmentally
   sound options which also save
   more energy.
   The Commission’s new proposal for a revised renewable energy directive
   (RED II) continues to
   consider the organic fraction of the municipal solid waste as a source
   of renewable energy. This is
   distorting the waste market by making it comparatively cheaper to
   recover energy from waste than
   to prevent or recycle it, effectively contradicting the waste hierarchy
   and hindering the transition
   towards more sustainable waste management systems and a circular
   economy.
   Zero Waste Europe calls on the European Parliament and Council to
   improve the proposed
   legislation by explicitly excluding the biodegradable fraction of
   municipal waste as eligible for
   renewable energy primes.

   Confederation of European Waste to Energy Plants:

   CEWEP supports source separation of waste (including biowaste) as this
   is a prerequisite to make quality recycling possible. The Waste
   Hierarchy (prevention, preparing for re-use, recycling, recovery,
   disposal) established under the Waste Framework Directive is to be
   respected. However, despite all efforts of source separation, there
   will always remain some polluted biodegradable part of the residual
   fraction of industrial, commercial and municipal waste (e.g. dirty
   cardboards, multilayer packaging etc.), which is not suitable for
   quality recycling or composting. This waste should be treated in an
   environmentally sound way and at the same time used to produce energy
   (heat, electricity, steam). Energy generation from the residual waste
   is a reasonable energy efficient option, replacing energy produced from
   fossil fuels. The only alternative treatment for this waste would be
   landfilling, the least desirable option in the European Waste Hierarchy
   and with regard to climate protection.

One response to “Waste: Subsidies make it cheaper to burn than recycle”

       Alternative Facts?
       I very much appreciate the factual reports published on Euractiv
       and it is therefore a surprise to me to read “facts” that are not
       reflecting reality, although this web-page is not Breitbart…
       As such the aim of the article is laudable: avoid wrong application
       of the RES subsidies and only support financially the energy
       generated from the renewable content of MSW.
       But how is it possible to state:
       “A waste hierarchy was devised, in which reducing, reusing and
       recycling waste sit at the top – and incineration is seen as the
       last resort.”
       The waste hierarchy sees an added value for WtE, since landfilling
       is the “last resort” and WtE is seen as a recovery operation. So
       the statement does not reflect reality, but to present WtE as the
       worst treatment option fits well in the overall tone of the
       article.
       The text states further:
       “And because waste is considered a renewable resource,…”
       Waste is not considers a renewable source. The biogenic fraction of
       MSW or biomass (also biomass waste) is.
       So by staying first that “waste can also be burnt to create heat or
       electricity,…” and then in the same paragraph state that waste is
       renewable (I suppose since it includes a biogenic fraction), one is
       creating a new fact that waste is considered a renewable source,
       which also fits well in the overall approach since later in the
       article thes financial support for all the waste is rightly
       attacked.
       Besides this, it is noteworthy that the article mentions “the
       biggest importers of waste for fuel and energy generation are the
       United Kingdom, …”
       This is not matching the reality neither. The European
       Environmental Agency states in her study, which is quoted in this
       article, on page 33-34 that the UK is an exporter. So this “fact”
       of the UK being an importer (although one cannot exclude that some
       waste is maybe imported, but which does not change the UK being a
       net exporter) was new to me.
       As stated, the aim of this article is laudable, but keeping a
       factual approach throughout the whole article is mandatory to stay
       credible.
       I’m persuaded that concerned EU associations would be always
       available for fact checking.
