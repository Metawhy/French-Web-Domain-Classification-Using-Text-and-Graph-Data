Software engineering and statistics

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYP53qDQAJQ?rel=0&showinfo=0&autoplay=1

OBJECTIVES

   The department of software engineering and statistics trains
   multiskilled engineers in the processing of information, both  in its
   statistical and computational forms, for use in various business
   professions. Given the cross-disciplinary nature of IT and statistics
   as disciplines, the areas of activity in which they appear are
   numerous, especially in the tertiary sector and the IT aspects of the
   secondary sector.

   Apart from the teaching of scientific concepts and the mastery of the
   tools used, the courses taught place particular importance on the
   learning of methods (ie the qualities of rigor, curiosity and
   inventiveness in scientific approaches) and the development of the
   personality of the student (communication and listening skills, team
   work, autonomy…)>

PROGRAM

   During the 3rd year (semesters 5 and 6), courses focus mainly on the
   teaching of fundamental subjects, based on the three main areas of
   specialisation of the department – IT, statistics and humanities. The
   specific classes offered to student engineers depend on the particular
   areas of previous study.

   During semesters 7 and 8, the student engineer deepens his/her
   knowledge of statistics (statistical modelling, exploratory
   statistics…), IT (object-oriented programming, architectural software,
   data bases, advanced systems….) and project management (information
   system projects, project management…). During this year, greater
   emphasis is placed on projects carried out in groups.

   During the 9th and 10th semesters, the student chooses a specialisation
   through the choice of optional courses. These include software
   engineering, data mining, statistical methods for marketing, the
   mathematics of new financial products, bio-statistics…The
   specialization is also determined through the choice of final year
   project and placement.

SECTORS OF ACTIVITY AND COMPANIES

   The omnipresent use of IT in management has been accompanied by the
   need to create tools that generate global representations of
   information, estimations and forecasts, in order to facilitate decision
   making. All areas of the tertiary sector are particularly concerned by
   these needs:
     * SSII (Sociétés de Services en Ingénierie Informatique – computer
       engineering and maintenance companies) : SOPRA, ATOS, LOGICA….

     * Banking and Insurance : Société Générale, COFIDIS….

     * Major retail outlets : AUCHAN, DECATHLON …

     * Public administration

     * Research : Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en
       Automatique  (INRIA) , CNRS, …

MAIN PROFESSIONS OPEN TO NEW GRADUATES

   This is the only program that trains multi-skilled engineers in the
   areas of IT, statistics, economics and social sciences. This
   particularity means that an engineer with this profile is particularly
   sought after in the workplace. Our student engineers use their
   competences in multiple sectors of activity:
   - as general IT specialists, given their mastery of computer systems
   and networks, information systems and data bases, software engineering,
   development of network services, project implementation…
   - as engineers, given their well-developed knowledge of economics,
   management, finance and international affairs.

LINKS WITH RESEARCH

   The program offered at Polytech Lille in the area of software
   engineering and statistics allows the student engineer to participate
   in activities linked with research within major research organisations,
   including:

   -          Le laboratoire d’Informatique Fondamentale de Lille (LIFL),
   associated with the CNRS (national research body),

   -          Le laboratoire de probabilités et statistiques (Laboratoire
   Paul Painlevé), associated with the CNRS,

   -          Le Centre de recherche INRIA Lille Nord Europe (Institut
   National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique).

   In most cases, the lecturers in this speciality carry out their
   research activities within these laboratories. The student engineers
   can thus undertake projects or work placements in areas related to the
   specialities of these research laboratories.

Measurement systems and applied business

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ni3ErXXkvAE?rel=0&showinfo=0&autoplay=1

OBJECTIVES

   Engineers trained by the department of Measurement Systems and Applied
   Business are specialists in measurement and analytical instruments in
   the areas of electronics, physics and chemistry. They benefit from a
   dual competence that is both technical and commercial, not only
   enabling them to detect, understand and analyse an instrumental need
   but also to market and/or develop appropriate solutions.
   They are able to offer companies a global solution, combining both
   commercial and scientific aspects, by analysing the client’s
   requirements in order to propose a multi-dimensional solution (through
   technical expertise, negotiation with the client, training programs and
   personally accompanying the client).
   Given their multidisciplinary training, they are reactive and can
   constantly adapt to technological evolutions. Thanks to their varied
   competences, they can look forward to extremely favourable employment
   prospects.

   > A broad scientific program of study (analog and digital electronics,
   telecommunication circuits and components, optics, lasers, chemistry…)
   enabling future engineers to rapidly adapt to new technologies and
   products.
   > A program in economics and commerce, which goes beyond what is
   generally offered in traditional engineering schools, enabling the
   student engineer to acquire notions which are specific to a business
   program: economic and social environment, sales techniques, management
   control, finance, taxation, commercial law, international commerce,
   marketing, project managementâ€¦ > The opportunity to acquire and
   practise communication techniques and to study two foreign languages
   (with a specialization in business English) completes the program,
   allowing the engineer to evolve and progress in international contexts.

SECTORS OF ACTIVITIES AND COMPANIES

   Engineers trained by the department of Measurement Systems and Applied
