Turmeric Tofu & Creamy Avocado on Toast

Ingredients

   1/2 block firm tofu
   1 tsp olive oil
   1/2 tsp turmeric powder
   1 clove minced garlic
   large pinch salt & pepper

   lime

   2 slices sourdough

   1 tbsp harissa (recipe here)

   1 tbsp toasted seeds (I used pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds)

Method

   For the tofu:

   Drizzle a dash of olive oil into a medium pan and simmer the minced
   garlic for around 1 minute

   Roughly crumble the tofu into large chunks and add to the pan

   Add the turmeric, a large pinch of pepper and salt to taste then gently
   fry for around 5-7 minutes

   For the zingy avocado:

   Smash 1 ripe avocado into a medium bowl, add 1 tbsp olive oil, a large
   pinch of salt and pepper and 1/2 juice of a lime

   Place your favourite bread (I chose sourdough) in the toaster then
   assemble the smashed avocado, turmeric and top with toasted seeds and
   harissa

   Enjoy!
