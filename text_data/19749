Beautiful Trouble

     ” . . . presents creative ways of drawing attention to injustice.”
     Ruth Latta, The Compulsive Reader

     * Training at CSU San Marcos

Training at CSU San Marcos

   Contributed by Chelsea Byers
   on November 27, 2017

   On October 25th, 2017, Beautiful Trouble delivered the third program in
   The Activist Lab series, which was held at the Cross-Cultural Center at
   California State University San Marcos. This series aims to teach
   students and faculty how to become better activists and advocates for
   social justice. Beautiful Trouble’s creative action workshop joined a
   “Know Your Rights” workshop by the ACLU, a poetry-as-activism workshop,
   and a screening of “How to Start a Revolution.”

   The two-hour creative action workshop was delivered by Beautiful
   Trouble’s Training Coordinator, Chelsea Byers, and new BT trainer Ruth
   Myers. Ruth brings to BT her history of union organizing, and currently
   works as a housing organizer with GroundUp Strategies.

   Nearly 50 students and faculty participated in the roundtable
   discussion on effective creative actions throughout history. After the
   signature Beautiful Trouble powerpoint presentation of creative
   actions, participants shared stories of how different principles and
   tactics have helped communicate messages and achieve activist goals.

   Students walked away with a deeper understanding of the history of
   nonviolent struggle, and a greater context of the spectrum of tactics
   accessible to creative organizers.

Media-jacking

   U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos capture global attention
   with a Black Power salute on the medal stand at the 1968 Olympics in
   Mexico City. This famous image subverted the spectacle of the medal
   ceremony to make a powerful statement rejecting racism and oppression.

   Contributed by Patrick Reinsborough, Doyle Canning and Joshua Kahn
   Russell
   Common Uses

   To undermine your opposition’s narrative by hijacking their event; to
   draw attention to your side of the story; to capitalize on your
   target’s media presence; to reframe an issue; to be a jackass.

   Media-jacking is when you subvert your opponent’s spectacle for your
   own purposes. Politicians, corporations and lobbyists have much bigger
   PR budgets and name-brand draw to attract press to their staged media
   events. Through well-planned creative interventions, however, you can
   refocus things and highlight a different side the story.

   There are a few different ways to design a successful media-jacking.
   The first is simply commandeering the media. One of the most literal
   (and bold) examples of this occurred in 1991 during the first Gulf War,
   when the anti-AIDS organization ACT UP burst into a CBS TV studio
   during a live primetime news broadcast and took over the set, chanting
   “Fight AIDS, not Arabs.”

   Another option is to use your opposition’s platform to tell your own
   story. In 2007, Kleenex ran an expensive PR stunt where they
   interviewed people on the street for a commercial they were making,
   getting participants to cry and say, “I need a Kleenex.” Greenpeace
   activists stealthily lined up to be interviewed, crying instead because
   Kleenex was clear-cutting old growth forests to make their tissues.
   They successfully shut down the shoot for the rest of the day, and a
   video of the action went viral.

   Sophisticated media-jacking uses your target’s own story against them,
   undermining them at the point of assumption see THEORY: Points of
   intervention. For example, when activists from United for a Fair
   Economy hijacked the Republican stunt on Tax Day 1998 see CASE: Whose
   Tea Party?, they turned the message “taxes = oppression” on its head,
   to show instead that tax breaks for the rich are destroying working
   families see PRINCIPLE: Reframe.

   Similarly, in 2006, activists with the Rainforest Action Network made
   fake press passes, put on suits and snuck into the Los Angeles Auto
   Show. Rick Wagoner, the CEO of General Motors, was giving a keynote
   address about how “environmentally friendly” GM’s cars are. The speech
   was bullshit, but rather than saying it was bullshit, RAN activists
   stepped on to the stage and up to the mic, pretending to be the emcees
   see PRINCIPLE: Use the Jedi mind trick. They congratulated Wagoner,
   then told the audience that they were pleased to announce that GM was
   prepared to commit in writing to the promises he’d just made, and
   unfurled an oversized “pledge” that they asked him to sign. He had two
   options: 1) sign it, and give the campaigners something in writing to
   hold him to, or 2) refuse, demonstrating his dishonesty see PRINCIPLE:
   Put your target in a decision dilemma. He chose the second option, and
   the media went nuts. Over 700 media outlets ran stories about GM’s
   greenwashing exposed.
   Key Principle at work

   Show, don't tell

   Media-jacking offers activists the unique opportunity to not just
   engage opponents on their playing field, but to actually call the shots
   and reframe the discussion. By putting their targets on the spot in
   front of the media, they can reshape how the public perceives the “good
   guys” and “bad guys” and flip their opponents’ story on its head.
   Potential Pitfalls

   Media is an extremely uneven terrain of struggle. Accurate and
   sympathetic media coverage is often based on having good relationships
   with journalists, so be careful your action doesn’t alienate the very
   media professionals you need to be covering the story.
