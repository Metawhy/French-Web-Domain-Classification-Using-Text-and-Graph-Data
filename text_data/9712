   Seabourn's Mediterranean ports map
   For those along its shores, the sea remains the heart of it all, an
   irresistible magnet drawing every gaze. Glimpse it shining from a
   sunlit piazza high on the Amalfi Coast, or glittering through a
   filigree of pines along the rocky Cap d’Antibes.
   Explore the vibrant cities of Rome, Venice, Nice and Barcelona, richly
   layered in history and deeply rooted in the sea. Follow the winding
   corniches of Monte Carlo, stacked atop a harbor bristling with masts of
   elegant yachts. Above the beaches and brightly painted fishing boats
   along the Cote d’Azur and Costa del Sol, amphitheaters of whitewashed
   villas are all aligned to meet you as you arrive from the sea.

   Seabourn's Northern Europeports map

   The northern hemisphere’s annual sunward tilt signals a celebration in
   Scandinavia’s modern capitals and picturesque towns. Restaurants in
   Stockholm set tables on the sidewalks. At lunchtime, Danish workers
   bask on park benches, faces turned to the sun. It is a wonderful time
   to visit as parks and gardens in Oslo and Helsinki come to life with
   brilliant flowers and the sounds of children playing. In St.
   Petersburg, descend an elegant staircase between sparkling, gilded
   fountains at the extravagant riverside Summer Palace. Relax by the pool
   as your ship eases gracefully between towering granite cliffs in
   Norway’s narrow Trollfjord. There’s no lovelier season than a
   Scandinavian summer, and no better way to experience it than on board
   Seabourn.

   When you cruise with Seabourn, we promise a voyage that is nothing
   short of magical. Each cruise to Northern Europe, Iceland and Greenland

   Seabourn's Pacific Coast ports map
   Today the coast is graced with handsome cities: the ethereal Emerald
   City of Seattle, Portland, the City of Roses, and San Francisco astride
   its seven hills above the Bay. Enchanting towns have thrived around the
   early Spanish missions: picturesque Monterey and Santa Barbara, the
   hillside American Riviera. Their historical and cultural attractions
   draw visitors from around the globe to enjoy their theaters, museums,
   galleries and arts festivals. On a Seabourn cruise, you’ll arrive in
   these cities in the time-honored way -- from the sea.
