   The person on the phone was very helpful, the process smooth and the
   fee seems relatively reasonable. I am pleased to be using a French
   company and although I speak French it is a lot easier conducting such
   formal conversations in English !

   The online application itself was very straightforward and seamless
   however since making the payment and forwarding the signed documents
   over a week ago, I have received nothing back from April. Not a receipt
   for the funds taken or any confirmation of my policy
   Nothing received in the post, so I have no idea if my wife and I have
   any insurance cover..
   So far Im a little concerned that i have spent a considerable sum and
   have what appears to be zero in return

   I had a lot of questions regarding APRIL International's Crystal
   Studies policy and the process of applying for this. Their staff was
   super responsive and was able to answer my inquiries very quickly. It
   made me feel very reassured of subscribing to my insurance policy
   online.
