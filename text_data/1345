   COOKIES
   We use ‚Äúcookies‚Äù to identify you when you visit our website.

   What are cookies?
   Cookies are small text files that are transferred from the website to
   your computer, phone or tablet. Websites store cookies on your internet
   browser (Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer, for example) when you
   visit. Every time you return to the site and navigate around it picks
   up these bits of information. There are several types of cookie and
   they each have different functions and uses. Some cookies can be really
   helpful and most websites rely on them in order to work properly and to
   understand what their users do when they visit.

   Types of cookies
   The four categories, from the least to the most intrusive, are:

   1. Strictly necessary. These cookies let you move around the website
   and use areas like e-news sign up. They don't gather information about
   you that could be used for marketing or remember where you've been on
   the internet. These cookies only last until you close your browser.

   2. Performance. These cookies help us understand how you use our
   website and if users have had any problems. They also let us know if
   you see one of our adverts online or click on our banners. The
   information they gather is anonymous. We only use the information to
   improve the way the Website works.

   3. Functionality. These cookies remember any choices you've made on a
   website. This could be changing the text size, preferences or
   colour. They can also remember if you've already completed a survey.
   They can‚Äôt track you on other websites.

   4. Targeting. These cookies collect info for third parties and remember
   what you looked at on a website. They‚Äôre used for things including
   ‚ÄòLike‚Äô and ‚ÄòShare‚Äô buttons, as well as online advertising. Do you see
   ads for things you've looked at online appear on random websites? It's
   because of targeting cookies.

2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

   We collect, use and share diligently and in strict compliance with the
   applicable laws the personal data that you freely choose to share with
   us when you decide to use our website (such as your email address -
   when you subscribe to our newsletter -  your name, email address,
   location, signature to a petition - when you sign an online action such
   as petition). You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your
   personal data and shall inform us of any change thereto. We shall bear
   no liability for the consequences of inaccurate or untrue data.

3. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

   As a general rule, your personal data will not be used for any other
   purpose than those for which they were voluntarily provided to us. Your
   personal data are shared or transferred to third parties if such
   sharing or transfer is authorized by you or required to achieve the
   purposes for which you have provided them to us. It means that we may
   share your personal data with service providers, who help assist us in
   fulfilling our purposes. For instance, by registering to our
   newsletter, you consent that your personal data (name and email) be
   processed for the purpose of sending you emails. Personal data may also
   be shared with third parties when required by law or by a court order.

   We use your data to:
     * keep a record of your engagement with us
     * send you updates, marketing and fundraising communications
     * understand how we can improve our services and information
     * campaign specific information - will be collected by a third party
       vendor, not MSF

   How we use your data depends on why you‚Äôre providing it:
   ONLINE FORMS
   We‚Äôll use your personal information to register you for our email
   newsletter.

   SURVEYS
   We use surveys to understand who visits our websites and how they use
   it, helping us to create better content for you and make our websites
   easier to use.
   We may ask for your email address if you‚Äôre happy to be involved in
   future surveys or testing. We‚Äôll only use this to ask you to help us
   with these types of requests.

   SOCIAL MEDIA
   We may use publicly available information from your profile to target
   you with specific posts that may interest you. We‚Äôll never ask for
   personal or sensitive information on social media. We may repost or
   share your posts on social media if it relates to MSF and our work. We
   may respond to questions, queries or comments left on our social media
   channels. We may use information found on your profile to help us
   answer these.

   Check your social media accounts if you want to change the information
   you make public. Our websites use sharing buttons which share our web
   pages to social media platforms. Use these buttons at your own
   discretion. Social media platforms may track these shares through your
   accounts.

   PETITIONS
   These are managed by third party vendors. Details are not stored by
   MSF.

   Further to the processing of your personal data according to the
   purposes for which you intentionally provided them to us, we further
   reserve our right to use all or part of your personal data for other
   purposes, such as to communicate with you, conduct surveys or recommend
   those of our initiatives that could be of interest to you. You further
   consent that some of your personal data be shared with affiliated
   members of the MSF movement worldwide, whether in Europe or in other
   countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong,
   India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United
   Arab Emirates or the United States of America (for a current list,
   please visit this website).

   We may share your personal data with service providers, who help assist
   us in fulfilling our purposes. By using those services, you accept that
   your personal data is shared with such service providers under their
   privacy policies, which we invite you to read carefully.

   Personal data may also be shared with third parties when required by
   law or by a court order. Also, in case of fraudulent use of our website
   and, in particular, upon suspicion of punishable acts, the data may be
   analysed for purposes of clarification and, upon duly justified
   request, transmitted to the competent official authorities or to the
   third person affected by the fraud.

   Depending on the circumstances, the collected data may be sent to,
   processed and stored on servers in foreign jurisdictions in Europe or
   in the United States or other jurisdictions outside of Europe (see list
   above) and thus be subject to foreign legislation.

   You may, at any time, object totally or partially to the use of your
   personal data for such purposes (opting-out) by writing to us by email
   (see contact details above).

4. WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR DATA?

   TRAINED STAFF
   Your information is only accessible by trained staff. We regularly
   review who has access to your information. As a general rule, your
   personal data will only be accessible insofar as it is necessary to
   fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. We do comprehensive
   checks on any contractors before we work with them. We always put a
   contract in place that sets out how they manage the personal data they
   collect or have access to.

   DATA PROCESSORS
   We use other companies to help us manage and store personal data and to
   carry out certain activities on our behalf.  Our main data processors
   are listed below, but we may enlist the services of others from time to
   time:
   Hosting: Acquia - https://www.acquia.com/
   Development:FFW -  https://ffwagency.com/
   We operate globally and may have a need to transfer certain data to
   countries outside the EEA. In the event the country where the data is
   transferred does not provide an adequate level of protection, we make
   sure to implement technical and organizational measures to protect your
   data. Should you have any questions in this respect we please contact
   us at Dataprotection.IO@geneva.msf.org

5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

   We use appropriate technical and organizational measures and
   precautions in order to protect your personal data and to prevent the
   loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data. Specifically we use
   an SSL certificate. We do not share information provided via newsletter
   sign up.

   Your personal data is transferred to, processed and stored by us in
   Switzerland and Europe (in particular, in the United Kingdom). When
   shared with third parties, they may be transferred in other countries
   as specified in each case and thus be subject to foreign legislation.
   All personal data are protected against unauthorised processing with
   the help of appropriate technical and organisational measures. You
   understand that ‚Äì despite the previous ‚Äì no data transmission or
   storage is 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee the security
   of any information you share with us and shall assume no liability
   should your personal information be accessed, disclosed, modified or
   destroyed by a breach of our safeguards.

6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

   We keep your information for as long as it‚Äôs necessary in connection
   with the purposes defined above in ‚ÄúHow do we use your information?‚Äù.
   For instance and as a general rule, we keep your email for the purpose
   of sending you a newsletter until you unsubscribe.

   If you request to receive no further contact from us, we'll keep only
   the basic information about you on our suppression list in order to
   avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future, for the duration
   allowed by the application legislation.

7. OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA

   Organisations need a lawful basis to collect and use personal data
   under data protection law. The law allows for six ways to process
   personal data (and additional ways for sensitive personal data). Three
   of these are relevant to the types of processing that MSF carries out:

     * A person‚Äôs consent (eg to send you direct marketing by e-mail)
     * Our legitimate interests:

   Our legitimate interests may include:
     * Administration and operational management; including responding to
       solicited enquires, providing information and services, research,
       events management, the administration of volunteers and employment
       and recruitment requirements.
     * Campaigning; including administering campaigns

   If you'd like to change our use of your personal data in this manner,
   please get in touch with us using the details above.

8. HOW CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR INFORMATION AND WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?

   Contact us at Dataprotection.IO@geneva.msf.org if you'd like to change
   or update your personal information.

   You have a number of rights under data protection legislation:
     * You can request any information we hold on you. Email us
       at Dataprotection.IO@geneva.msf.org and ask for it in writing. You
       may be asked for proof of identity.
     * You have the right to ask us to stop using or to restrict the
       processing of your personal data.
     * You can withdraw your consent to us processing your data at any
       time (where such processing is based on consent eg to send you
       electronic direct marketing).
     * If you believe our records are inaccurate you have the right to ask
       for those records concerning you to be updated. To update your
       records please get in touch with us using the details above.
     * In accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection
       Regulation, you have a right to erasure (‚Äúto be forgotten‚Äù i.e. to
       have your personal data deleted from our database), or transferred
       to another organisation (‚Äúdata portability‚Äù).
     * If you have any concerns about the way your data is being used or
       if you‚Äôd like to make a complaint, please contact us using the
       details above.
     * You are entitled to file a complaint about how MSF treats your
       data. To do so, you may directly contact: Pr√©pos√© F√©d√©ral √† la
       Protection des Donn√©es et √† la Transparence (PFPDT), Feldeggweg 1,
       CH-3003 Berne (tel.: +41 (0)58 462 43 95).

9. WHEN DO WE UPDATE THIS NOTICE?

   We change this Privacy Notice when we need to. If we make any
   significant changes in the way we treat your personal information we‚Äôll
   make this clear on our websites or by contacting you directly.
