A Cohort Perspective on the Demography of Grandparenthood

A Cohort Perspective on the Demography of Grandparenthood: Past, Present, and
Future Changes in Race and Sex Disparities in the United States

   Authors: Rachel Margolis, Ashton M. Verdery

   Read this article in the August 2019, Volume 56, Issue 4 of Demography.

   How has the demography of grandparenthood changed over the last
   century? How have racial inequalities in grandparenthood changed, and
   how are they expected to change in the future? Massive improvements in
   mortality, increasing childlessness, and fertility postponement have
   profoundly altered the likelihood that people become grandparents as
   well as the timing and length of grandparenthood for those that do. The
   demography of grandparenthood is important to understand for those
   taking a multigenerational perspective of stratification and racial
   inequality because these processes define the onset and duration of
   intergenerational relationships in ways that constrain the forms and
   levels of intergenerational transfers that can occur within them. In
   this article, we discuss four measures of the demography of
   grandparenthood and use simulated data to estimate the broad contours
   of historical changes in the demography of grandparenthood in the
   United States for the 1880–1960 birth cohorts. Then we examine race and
   sex differences in grandparenthood in the past and present, which
   reveal declining inequality in the demography of grandparenthood and a
   projection of increasing group convergence in the coming decades.

Measuring the Impact of Incarceration on Individuals, Neighborhoods, and
Society

Congressional Briefing

   On October 10, PAA and the Association for Public Policy Analysis and
   Management will co-host a briefing for congressional staff.

   There are nearly 2.2 million incarcerated Americans, according to the
   Bureau of Justice Statistics. If this population were to form a city,
   it would be the 5th largest in the country—just behind Houston. The
   fiscal cost of maintaining this incarceration rate is carried by the
   taxpayer, while the human cost is borne by families, neighborhoods and
   those serving time. With so much at stake, how do we measure both the
   cost and effectiveness of criminal justice policies? Please join us for
   an examination of the fiscal and human implications of high
   incarceration rates—drawn from analysis of state and federal statistics
   as well as the lived experiences of the recently incarcerated.

   Moderator: Dr. Nancy G. La Vigne, Urban Institute
   Panelists:
     * Dr. Jeffrey Morenoff, University of Michigan
     * Dr. Samuel Norris, University of Chicago

Comments Accepted Through June 10, 2011 on NICHD White Papers from Vision
Workshops

   COMMENTS BEING ACCEPTED THROUGH JUNE 10, 2011 on NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
   CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WHITE PAPERS from VISION WORKSHOPS

   As you know, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
   Health and Human Development (NICHD) is conducting a “Vision” process
   to identify “the next decade’s most scientific opportunities across the
   Institute’s most diverse research areas.” The process consisted of nine
   workshops centered around broad scientific themes. White papers from
   these workshops are being posted for public comment as they become
   available. Currently, six papers are posted.

   These white papers describe the key ideas discussed at the workshops
   and will inform the final NICHD Scientific Vision statement. Comments
   are being carefully reviewed by Institute staff and will be VERY
   important to informing the final product.

   According to the Institute, they “appreciate all comments related to
   the NICHD Vision process, but are particularly interested in input
   regarding any perceived gaps in the white papers, i.e., any key
   scientific opportunities related to the Vision themes that are not in
   the white papers but that merit attention.”

   The white papers are posted at:
   http://www.nichd.nih.gov/vision/overview.cfm. Please consider sending
   your own comments on any of these important papers.

   Thank you!
