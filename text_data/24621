Kravet Launches Fifth Fabric Collection with Museum of New Mexico

   Museum of New Mexico Kravet Room

   Kravet is pleased to announce its fifth collaboration with Museum of
   New Mexico. For this fabric collection, the Museum tells the story of
   its unique place as a crossroads of international trade and culture
   through fabrics inspired by the Museum's renowned textile, basketry and
   ceramic collections.

   Inspiration for these modern interpretations of traditional designs was
   drawn primarily from small-scale patterns and embroideries in the
   25,000-piece textile and dress collection at the Museum of
   International Folk Art. Iconic Native American textile and ceramic
   pieces from the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture also influenced many of
   the collection's designs. These museums comprise two of the Museum of
   New Mexico's four cultural institutions.

   Color and texture inspirations came from diverse mediums such as
   pottery, basketry, textiles and cut paper patterns. The result is rich
   textures and pops of vivid colors that mimic the crisp blue sky, the
   red earth and an array of the complementary hues, both hot and cool, so
   often identified with the beautiful Santa Fe landscape.

   Textile designer and Museum of International Folk Art donor Alexander
   Girard quoted an Italian proverb when asked why he collected the folk
   art of the world's artisans: "Tutto il mondo e paes" or "the whole
   world is hometown."

   "In partnering with us and by choosing such a broad spectrum of Museum
   textiles for inspiration, Kravet too is saying, 'The whole world is
   hometown' and that there are no foreigners," said Pamela Kelly, Vice
   President of Licensing and Brand Management for the Museum.

   Santa Fe has been an international hub of culture and commerce for
   centuries, as well as a creative haven for artists, writers, collectors
   and others drawn to the region's bohemian lifestyle, spacious
   landscapes and rich cultural traditions. This eclectic ensemble of
   textiles embodies this creative approach to living - collected, worldly
   and modern.

   www.museumfoundation.org and from there you can access each individual
   museum's website. For more about the fabric collection, visit

Lee Jofa Introduces Bunny Williams Fabric Collection

   Beauty1

   Lee Jofa is pleased to announce the highly anticipated Bunny Williams
   fabric collection. Williams, in her first textile collection, shares
   her modern vision and appreciation for gracious Southern living through
   beautifully rendered prints, weaves and embroideries in a charming
   color palette.

   Comprised of designs that resonate with Williams' classic yet fresh
   sense of style, the collection offers cohesive patterns in soft,
   harmonized colors with endless design possibilities. Williams drew
   inspiration from her personal collection of treasured textiles to
   create styles that seamlessly transition from elegant to casual
   interiors.

   "There is a subtlety to this fabric collection," said Williams. "I
   thought of this collection in the same way I think about putting
   together a scheme for a room. There is color, but it is not too strong.
   All the prints have stripes and solids that work with them to make
   interesting combinations."

    "Throughout my career, I've continually admired Bunny's singular style
   for creating wonderful interiors for her clients and herself," said
   Stephen Elrod, executive vice president and creative director for Lee
   Jofa and Brunschwig & Fils. "They layer the best of various design
   periods in a luxurious but comfortable manner, totally reflective of
   Bunny's superb eye and graciousness. It's been a delight for us to
   collaborate with her and bring her unique vision for exquisite fabrics
   to fruition."

   Feminine designs like stylized roses, modern toile, and petite patterns
   mix with fresh contemporary designs to deliver timeless rooms.
   Raspberry, lavender, soft blue, and peach color stories provide a broad
   spectrum of versatility.

   "Fabrics set the tone for a room, both in color and texture. A project
   could be a beach house, a formal city living room, a modern apartment
   overlooking Central Park and each require fabrics that suit that
   project," said Williams.

   The collection is available through the Lee Jofa network of showrooms
   and road representatives, as well as online through www.leejofa.com.

In Memoriam: Christopher Adlington

   Christopher Adlington


   MEMORIES OF OUR UNCLE CHRISTOPHER ADLINGTON

   By Abigail Compton-Burnett, Christopher's eldest niece

   Christopher was born the youngest of three boys on 25 September 1937.
   The family lived in a beautiful old house, overlooking the sea, in
   Great Yarmouth, which is a port on the east coast of England.

   Christopher was two years old when war broke out in England.  Whilst
   Christopher’s brothers were away to boarding school, Christopher often
   went to the local hospital to help his mother tend to people who had
   been injured in bombing raids.  His mother, whom he affectionately
   called “Ma,” observed that Christopher was “a great favourite, with
   fair, wavy hair, and usually dressed in a lemon coloured coat.”  She
   added that he was sunny, but very composed, had a lively imagination,
   and was never untidy!

   When he was three, the Adlington home took a direct bomb hit.
   Mercifully, Christopher sustained only minor injuries and was primarily
   concerned with being soaking wet, due to a deluge from a burst water
   pipe on the stairs.

   The following year, Ma sustained far greater injuries during a bombing
   raid.  Her leg was very badly damaged, and she was in a hospital for
   several weeks.  Christopher missed Ma terribly and used great ingenuity
   to find presents that he could take to her in the hospital.  One
   afternoon during tea with the local vicar, Christopher decided that the
   silver napkin ring that he was using would be a wonderful gift, so
   popped it into his pocket!

   When the war finally ended in 1945, the blackout that had extinguished
   street lights and covered every window with black paper was finally
   lifted.  As a child who had grown up in the war, Christopher had never
   seen lights at night and spent hours gazing out of his window on the
   magical, twinkling scene.

   Christopher followed his brother, Peter, to Epsom College, near
   London.  Whilst he was there, his eldest brother, Tony, tragically
   drowned off the coast of the Isle of Man.  Christopher had been very
   fond of Tony, and his death affected him profoundly.  For the rest of
   Christopher’s life, the Isle of Man, where Tony is buried, held a
   special place in his heart.

   When Christopher left Epsom College, he decided that he did not want to
   be a doctor like his father and brother, so became articled to a
   Chartered Accountant in London for six years.

   When he qualified, he decided to take a six week trip to America.  He
   booked a $40 Greyhound bus ticket with which he toured America,
   beginning and ending in New York.

   Christopher wrote to his parents to say that he would like to stay and
   work in America, if he could get a job.  He found a temporary position
   with the Columbia Broadcasting System in San Francisco.  After six
   weeks, he secured a job with Arthur H. Lee Inc., which made and
   marketed English furnishing fabrics.  He was soon firmly established in
   their Headquarters in New York.  He loved his job and enjoyed visiting
   Lee’s showrooms and agents in the US, England and, particularly, in the
   Isle of Man, where one of their favourite mill owners lived.

   He loved his home in New York, but retained his fondness for England
   and his family who lived there.  The timings of his visits were
   governed mainly by the blossoming of English flora and fauna, since one
   of his greatest passions was visiting the gardens of England.
   Christopher was delighted that Pix, his brother Peter’s wife, shared
   his passion for garden visits, even though Peter did not!  Christopher
   and Pix would deposit Peter in the nearest tea room or pub and spend
   hours exploring flowers, shrubs, trees and perfectly manicured lawns
   together and drawing inspiration for their gardens.

   Christopher was very generous with his time and energy, and he spent
   hours toiling in Peter and Pix’s garden.  No weed, moss or mildew was
   safe during his visits, and every hedge was clipped to within an inch
   of its life! He seemed indefatigable.  Peter once remarked that
   Christopher was like a clockwork mouse: you would wind him up and he
   would go on forever!

   Christopher was the family oracle when it came to all issues of taste
   and style.  He advised on the paint and furnishings for every room,
   bringing armloads of samples and fabrics with him on every visit.  No
   decorating challenge was too great and he would often spend hours
   researching options until he had found the perfect solution.  He was a
   wonderful confidante.  Each family member valued his wisdom,
   warm-heartedness, and tact.  He also had the wonderful gift of bringing
   light to every situation.

   Even after many years in New York, Christopher still had his suits and
   coats made in London, and was very much an English gentleman.  One of
   his greatest joys and achievements was his beautiful “English garden in
   Brooklyn.”  Christopher would have been delighted to know how many
   people had been touched by his beautiful garden, which he created and
   tended over many years.  He worked hard to recreate in Brooklyn the
   English gardens that he had seen, using sharp clippers to rein in the
   hedges, strict watering regimes and never-quite-violent words for the
   squirrels that chewed up his lawn.

   In so many ways, Christopher, just like his garden, gently and warmly
   touched the hearts of all those around him, friends and strangers
   alike.  We will carry the light and joy that he brought to us with our
   fond memories of a very dear English gentleman, our Uncle Christopher
   Adlington.

Meet the Curator: Nick Olsen

   NickOlsen_BlueSofa Curated Kravet

   One of the exciting aspects of CuratedKravet.com is the “shop the room”
   experience. Designers and tastemakers, including Nick Olsen, have
   designed rooms and spaces that are filled to the brim with furniture
   and accessories, all of which are available for purchase on the site.
   Take a few moments today to get to know Nick, then head over to
   CuratedKravet.com to shop for fabulous furniture and accessories
   selected exclusively by Nick:


   Most of our readers know you already, but just for fun, tell us about
   yourself.

   Where to start? Well I was born on a cold day in March ... kidding! I
   grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida and have always been obsessed with
   design: clothes, cars, furniture, homes, etc., and how each speaks to a
   sense of fantasy. I studied to be an architect but fell into my dream
   job after college, working for the decorator Miles Redd. He taught me
   the business of design, furniture planning, how to manage clients'
   needs, and opened my eyes to this fabulous world. After five years at
   his company I left to start my own, and business has grown every year
   since. The fact that I spend my spare time shopping for furniture and
   artwork, travel, and design for myself means I've found my calling!

   How would you describe your design aesthetic?

   Bold and colorful, with an eye toward the past and a forward-thinking
   sense of humor. If a room I've designed makes me smile, then I've
   succeeded.

   NickOlsen_Barcart Curated Kravet

   What questions do you ask your clients before starting a new project?

   I ask TONS of questions! From the mundane like, "What's your favorite
   color?" to "What drives you crazy in your current home?” to asking for
   a peek inside their closets. A person's favorite outfit is very
   telling. Of course practical questions come in handy like, “Are you TV
   watchers?” “How often do you entertain, if at all?” No satin upholstery
   for young families ... I've learned that one the hard way!

   Conversely, what kinds of questions do your clients ask you?

   Beyond the inevitable questions about budget (there's always a budget,
   no matter what anyone says) I find my clients need reassurance that it
   will come together and look like them. The most gratifying compliment
   one client gave is: "This looks just like me, but 10 times better than
   anything I could do myself!"

   Designers often tell us about the challenges they face completing the
   last 10 percent of a project. How do you think a website like
   CuratedKravet.com will assist in this process?

   I think it will be a HUGE help in the visualization department. I am no
   minimalist, but even in less colorful rooms it's often the books,
   objects and accessories that bring the space to life. I'd show a client
   the CuratedKravet site and say: "How lonely would that chair look
   without a lumbar pillow?" or "See how a table lamp on your bar cart
   would lighten up that corner?" I understand why people lose steam at
   the end of a project, but it's often the earrings or handsome belt that
   make an outfit, and rooms are no different.

   NickOlsen_Ikat_Chairs Curated Kravet

   What does the word “Curated” mean to you?

   Carefully selected with an expert eye. I'm a devoted shopper, and it's
   my job to find the best options available at every level of the market.

   CuratedKravet.com is unique because its products are only available to
   the interior design trade. Why is that important to you?

   I think it's a vote of confidence in our profession as a whole. So much
   design is available to the public, yet they're often completely lost on
   how to pull their rooms together. A to-the-trade approach says, "These
   are tools in the hands of professionals who will make your home (and
   life!) better and more beautiful."

   Who is your ideal client and why?

   Really anyone with an adventurous spirit and a strong point of view but
   also wants to collaborate. Tilda Swinton comes to mind: she makes
   avant-garde fashion look effortless but also keeps a sense of humor
   about herself.

   What is your favorite item in the room you designed for
   CuratedKravet.com?

   Difficult to pick just one! I'd say the tufted chair in the living
   room, upholstered in bold jumbo paisley cotton and paired with a
   fuchsia silk lumbar pillow, really reflects my design aesthetic. A
   classic shape made youthful with strong colors and texture contrast.

   NickOlsen_YellowChairs_ Curated Kravet

   What accessory or styling trick in a room (generally speaking) is
   underrated?

   Fresh flowers! Some $5 carnations from Costco bunched together in a low
   vase always perks up a space.

   What accessory or styling trick in a room (generally speaking) is
   overrated?

   Overly symmetrical bookcase styling. If the combination of books and
   objects is too repetitive your home will look like a showroom.

   You’ve known about the site for months. Now that it’s live, what is the
   first thing you plan to buy?

   Some of that blue and white checked bedroom wallpaper would look snappy
   in my bathroom at home!

   What was the best advice you received about your career?

   Miles [Redd] would always turn the tables on a fabric or piece of
   furniture I'd selected and ask, "Would you want it for yourself?" I
   love SO many styles, so much design, but that's still the standard: if
   I wouldn't live with it in my own home, I'm not selling it to a client.
   That's the service they're paying for!
