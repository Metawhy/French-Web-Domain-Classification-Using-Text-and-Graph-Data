Joomla Hosting FAQ

   Our answers to most frequently asked Joomla hosting questions.

What is Joomla?

   Currently holding the title as the world’s second most popular content
   management system (CMS), Joomla is a flexible platform that you can use
   to make any type of website. Since the initial release in 2005, it
   provides the opportunity of building an online presence to millions of
   webmasters, bloggers, and business owners all around the globe.

How is Joomla hosting different?

   Packed with performance updates and custom configuration, Joomla
   hosting aims to provide the perfect setup for Joomla based websites.
   Focus on the quality and content of your web pages, while we take care
   of the server uptime, updates, and improvements. Get the most out of
   Joomla CMS with Hostinger.

How can I migrate my existing Joomla website?

   To transfer your existing Joomla site, you must first create a full
   backup. The easiest way of doing it is by using a plugin such as Akeeba
   Backup, which lets you easily backup and restore Joomla based sites. In
   case you run into any hiccups along the way, our dedicated support team
   will be ready to help you day and night!

What kind of websites can I create with Joomla?

   As a content management system, Joomla gives you a lot of flexibility
   and freedom. This gives you the opportunity to set up various types of
   websites, including:

     * Niche blogs;
     * Review sites;
     * Job listing sites;
     * Affiliate sites;
     * Personal portfolios;
     * Online stores;

   And much more thanks to the huge library of free extensions that Joomla
   offers out of the box.

Can Joomla be used for eCommerce?

   You surely can, and there's more than one way to do it! Within the free
   Joomla plugin directory, you'll find various extensions that will let
   you turn your website into an online store. Each one has a unique set
   of features and you can test them all out before deciding which is one
   best suited for your needs.

How secure is Joomla hosting?

   To ensure a smooth online experience, all Joomla hosting servers are
   protected with BitNinja real-time security. Pair that with a set of
   custom firewall rules, and the result is a secure web environment
   protected from malware, DDoS, brute force, XSS and similar threats.

Is Joomla better than WordPress?

   While there is no clear cut winner between the two content management
   systems, Joomla is among the top WordPress alternatives that you’ll
   come across. Almost a third of all websites around the world are based
   on these open source platforms. Thus when it comes to building a
   website, both are top-notch choices with their sets of pros and cons.
