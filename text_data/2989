PollerCoaster 2020: Arizona Is Winnable

   Dan Pfeiffer / Oct.3.19

   A consistent narrative of Trump as a chaotic corporatist who divides
   America in order to help big business and his wealthy friends is the
   foundation for the campaign against him.

What A Day: Bull and a China flop

   Oct.3.19

   LIVE FROM DC, IT'S CRIMES If you hark back to the simpler, more
   innocent era of last week, you’ll recall that some Democrats wanted to
   limit their impeachment inquiry to the Trump-Ukraine scandal alone.

“Ukraine, if you’re listening.”

   Oct.3.19

   Trump commits the impeachable offenses he’s accused of on live
   television, Congress subpoenas the White House and its Cabinet
   co-conspirators, and our latest PollerCoaster 2020 shows that Arizona
   is a top-tier battleground state.

PollerCoaster 2020: What’s Happening In Arizona

   Crooked Media / Oct.3.19

   What’s the most effective argument against Trump here? We tested a few
   different messages, and two clear winners emerged.

Impeachment is the Republican Party’s Final Test

   Brian Beutler / Oct.3.19

   Impeachment will ultimately force Republican senators to say whether
   it’s the their view that Republican politicians can lie, cheat, and
   steal to stay in power, and there is nothing the majority can do about
   it.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO TO WIN IN 2020

   We're partnering with Stacey Abrams and Fair Fight 2020 to fund, staff,
   and train voter protection teams in 20 battleground states.

The F*ck Gerry (mandering) Fund

   Donate

   Verified It won't matter who winds up in the White House in 2020 if
   they don't have the power to actually, you know, govern. This won't
   happen if Republicans get to draw their own gerrymandered Congressional
   districts. So we’ve teamed up with @dataforprogress to launch the F*ck
   Gerry(mandering) fund. We are targeting 12 states over the next two
   years, starting with Virginia. The state's entire legislature is up for
   reelection in 2019 and our friends at Data for Progress have identified
   10 winnable races in Virginia where your contributions will go the
   furthest in securing a much-needed seat for Democrats. This will help
   make sure that the state doesn’t have a bunch of Republican-drawn
   districts during the next census in 2020. Gerrymandering! It's fucking
   up our democracy and it's time to take action.

“ it is the wrong thing to do for the president to abuse his pardon power ”

   Pod Save America/ May.20.19

   Justin Amash becomes the first Republican Congressman to say that the
   President crossed the threshold for impeachment, and Joe Biden says
   that Democrats don’t want an angry candidate. Congresswoman Pramila
   Jayapal and Goldie Taylor join Jon, Jon, Tommy, and Dan on stage at the
   Anthem Theater in Washington, DC.

Media Can Kick Its Horserace Addiction—And It Must

   Brian Beutler / Jan.11.19

   A better way is staring us in the face, and with the failures of 2016
   still fresh on everyone’s mind, there’s never been a better time to
   propose fresh approaches.
