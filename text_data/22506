   Xomnia is a word combining the letter ‘X’ – the unknown – and “Omnia” –
   Latin for everything. Our team of data scientists and big data
   engineers are trained to find the undefined – X – in all the relevant
   data sources – Omnia. This unknown – X – is untapped business value.
   Combining the X and Omnia you get the Xomnia spirit. Eager, curious and
   dedicated people, who have the belief that the future is big data.
