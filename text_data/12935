4. Sharing of Information

     * Each WSL Entity may disclose Personal Data to other WSL Entities,
       which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose
       for which it was originally collected and as described herein. All
       WSL Entities abide by this Privacy Policy.
     * In some circumstances, WSL collects Personal Data about you from a
       third-party source (e.g. if WSL runs a competition or event in
       conjunction with a third-party co-promoter and you provide your
       Personal Data to it). As a general rule WSL will attempt to ensure
       any third parties from whom it obtains Personal Data about you
       comply with the privacy law requirements of your jurisdiction and
       have advised you that your Personal Data may or will be passed on
       to WSL and/or WSL affiliates or sponsors and that such third party
       has taken reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of the
       purposes for which WSL is collecting your Personal Data and that
       you have consented to the same, including its use in accordance
       with this Privacy Policy.
     * WSL may engage third-party contractors to perform services which
       may involve the contractor handling your Personal Data. In these
       situations, WSL restricts such third party to using any of your
       Personal Data for the purpose permitted under this Privacy Policy.
     * When you register on a WSL Digital Site, we collect Personal Data
       which we use in compliance with your notification preferences,
       which you may alter at any time. We use a third-party provider,
       MailChimp, to deliver our e-mail notifications. We gather
       statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard
       technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-mails. For more
       information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice. You can
       unsubscribe from receiving e-mails by changing your preferences in
       the profile section or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the
       bottom of any of our emails.
     * In limited circumstances WSL may provide your Personal Data to
       third parties such as co-sponsors or promoters of WSL events for
       use as permitted in this Privacy Policy. WSL may also share
       information about your use of the WSL Digital Sites in anonymized,
       aggregate form with our trusted social media, advertising and
       analytic partners for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy,
       for example, to improve and personalize your experience on the WSL
       Digital Sites or to perform analytics.
     * Third parties such as WSL’s advertisers, sponsors, service
       providers or social media platforms, including, but not limited to,
       Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube may receive or gather
       information about end users, including through the use of cookies,
       pixels, SDKs, web beacons or other tracking software and use that
       information for targeted advertising. WSL also uses third-party
       advertising companies to serve ads on WSL Digital Sites, which may,
       directly or indirectly, collect or use information about your
       visits to websites to display advertisements more tailored to your
       interests.
     * Please note that while the WSL is careful about choosing its
       sponsors, advertisers and partner third parties, it is only
       responsible for the content on the WSL Digital Sites and for the
       use of your Personal Data by any WSL Entity. All third parties
       associated with a WSL Digital Site with whom WSL may share Personal
       Data are bound by their own privacy and data collection and
       protection practices. WSL cannot be held liable for the policies or
       actions of such third parties. We encourage users to read the
       privacy policy of any click-thru site they visit through a WSL
       Digital Site.

5. Accuracy, Completeness and Deletion requests

     * WSL will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your
       Personal Data is kept accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If any of
       the Personal Data WSL holds about you is inaccurate, incomplete or
       out-of-date, please contact WSL immediately using the contact
       details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
     * WSL shall recognize any valid requests from individuals to delete
       their Personal Data from use for any reason and has systems and
       procedures in place to comply with a request for deletion. Any such
       requests should be made by contacting WSL directly using the
       contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.

6. Other people's information which you provide to WSL

   If you provide Personal Data to WSL about someone else, such as your
   agent or next of kin, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose
   such information to WSL and that WSL can collect, use and disclose such
   information for the purposes described above without being required to
   do anything else under relevant privacy laws (which may include laws of
   a country they are from or in which they reside). You should take
   reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the
   contents of this Privacy Policy as those matters relate to them. You
   warrant that any information you disclose is true and correct.

7. Unsolicited Submissions and Feedback

   Please be aware that WSL does not accept unsolicited submissions of
   concepts, creative ideas, suggestions, stories, scripts, or other
   potential creative content (“Unsolicited Submissions”). This is to
   avoid the possibility of future misunderstanding when projects
   developed by WSL staff or representatives might seem to others to be
   similar to their submitted concepts, creative ideas, suggestions,
   stories, scripts, or other potential creative content. Therefore,
   please do not send WSL any Unsolicited Submissions. In the event you do
   send WSL an Unsolicited Submission, you understand and agree that your
   Unsolicited Submission does not create any fiduciary relationship
   between you and WSL and that WSL is under no obligation to refrain from
   using the Unsolicited Submission (in whole or in part), to keep it
   confidential, or to compensate you for WSL’s use of it.

8. Security and Retention of your Personal Data

     * Personal Data the WSL holds is stored either in hard copy documents
       or as electronic data. WSL uses generally accepted industry
       standard reasonable security measures to protect any Personal Data
       held in any form from misuse, loss, unauthorized access,
       modification and/or disclosure.
     * Your membership on a WSL Digital Site is password protected and we
       recommend that you do not divulge your passwords to anyone. You are
       solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member name,
       password and other account information.
     * Any information posted or disclosed on a message board or comment
       section may be viewed and used by other members of the public. If
       you post any Personal Data in a publicly accessible area of a WSL
       Digital Site, you do so at your own risk and WSL accepts no
       liability for the same.
     * WSL shall retain your Personal Data only so long as it is necessary
       for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your
       account or membership is active. We respect requests we receive
       from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights
       in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We reserve the
       right to keep certain information in our archives that we deem
       necessary to comply with any legal obligations we may have, resolve
       disputes and enforce contractual agreements.

       uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile
       device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. Most

       instructions on how to prevent delivery of tailored advertising to
       your mobile device. Please also review your mobile device’s privacy
       settings and support materials if you wish to opt-out of tailored

10. Social Networking

     * You may use certain third-party social networking services,

       information about your experience on the WSL Digital Sites with
       your friends and followers on those social networking services.
       These social networking services may be able to collect information
       about you, including your activity on the WSL Digital Sites. These
       third-party social networking services also may notify your
       friends, both on the WSL Digital Sites and on the social networking
       services themselves, that you are a user of the WSL Digital Sites
       or about your use of the WSL Digital Sites, in accordance with
       applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to
       access or make use of third-party social networking services, we
       may receive information about you that you have made available to
       those social networking services, including information about your
       contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions
       with those social networking services are governed by the privacy
       policy of the company providing the relevant service.
     * You also may be able to link an account from a social networking
       service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Instagram) to your account on the
       WSL Digital Sites. This may allow you to use your credentials from
       the other site or service to sign in to certain features on the WSL
       Digital Sites. If you link your account from a third-party site or
       service, we may collect information from those third-party
       accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by
       this Privacy Policy.

   The WSL Digital Sites may contain links to other websites or online
   services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are
   not under WSL’s control or maintained by WSL. Such links do not
   constitute an endorsement by WSL of those other websites, the content
   displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.
   This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third- party websites. We
   encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party
   websites or services.

   be resolved according to the laws of the state of California, USA and

13. Transfer and Storage of Data

     * While every effort is made to comply with the laws and regulations
       of all jurisdictions in which the WSL Digital Sites may be accessed
       please be advised that the WSL Digital Sites are directed towards
       users who reside in the United States. The servers on which data is
       stored, including any Personal Data, are located in the United
       States, and the WSL Digital Sites comply with relevant laws and
       regulations under Californian law, as explained in this Privacy
       Policy. By continuing to use the WSL Digital Sites you hereby
       consent to your information being collected, stored, and used in
       the United States, as stated in this Privacy Policy.
     * If you are located in the European Economic Area or the European
       Union or a country with data protection and/or privacy laws which
       are different from those in the state of California, please be
       advised that we may transfer your Personal Data to countries that
       may not guarantee the same level of protection for Personal Data as
       the one in which you reside.
     * WSL will only transfer or share Personal Data to the extent it is
       necessary to fulfill the purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy
       and your data will be processed in accordance with the provisions
       set out in this Privacy Policy.

14. California Privacy Rights

       request, please send an email to support@worldsurfleague.com or
       write to us at the address listed below.
     * Some web browsers transmit a ‘do not track’ signal or such similar
       signals to websites that a user may visit or interact with. At
       present, there is no recognized industry standard concerning what
       action, if any, a website provider must take with respect to such
       ‘do not track’ signals. As such, please be advised that, at
       present, the WSL Digital Sites do not take any action in response
       to such signals.

15. Changes to this Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 25, 2018, and will remain in
   effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the
   future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this
   page. WSL reserves the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at
   any time and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy

4. Sharing of Information

     * Each WSL Entity may disclose Personal Data to other WSL Entities,
       which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose
       for which it was originally collected and as described herein. All
       WSL Entities abide by this Privacy Policy.
     * In some circumstances, WSL collects Personal Data about you from a
       third-party source (e.g. if WSL runs a competition or event in
       conjunction with a third-party co-promoter and you provide your
       Personal Data to it). As a general rule WSL will attempt to ensure
       any third parties from whom it obtains Personal Data about you
       comply with the privacy law requirements of your jurisdiction and
       have advised you that your Personal Data may or will be passed on
       to WSL and/or WSL affiliates or sponsors and that such third party
       has taken reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of the
       purposes for which WSL is collecting your Personal Data and that
       you have consented to the same, including its use in accordance
       with this Privacy Policy.
     * WSL may engage third-party contractors to perform services which
       may involve the contractor handling your Personal Data. In these
       situations, WSL restricts such third party to using any of your
       Personal Data for the purpose permitted under this Privacy Policy.
     * When you register on a WSL Digital Site, we collect Personal Data
       which we use in compliance with your notification preferences,
       which you may alter at any time. We use a third-party provider,
       MailChimp, to deliver our e-mail notifications. We gather
       statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard
       technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-mails. For more
       information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice. You can
       unsubscribe from receiving e-mails by changing your preferences in
       the profile section or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the
       bottom of any of our emails.
     * In limited circumstances WSL may provide your Personal Data to
       third parties such as co-sponsors or promoters of WSL events for
       use as permitted in this Privacy Policy. WSL may also share
       information about your use of the WSL Digital Sites in anonymized,
       aggregate form with our trusted social media, advertising and
       analytic partners for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy,
       for example, to improve and personalize your experience on the WSL
       Digital Sites or to perform analytics.
     * Third parties such as WSL’s advertisers, sponsors, service
       providers or social media platforms, including, but not limited to,
       Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube may receive or gather
       information about end users, including through the use of cookies,
       pixels, SDKs, web beacons or other tracking software and use that
       information for targeted advertising. WSL also uses third-party
       advertising companies to serve ads on WSL Digital Sites, which may,
       directly or indirectly, collect or use information about your
       visits to websites to display advertisements more tailored to your
       interests.
     * Please note that while the WSL is careful about choosing its
       sponsors, advertisers and partner third parties, it is only
       responsible for the content on the WSL Digital Sites and for the
       use of your Personal Data by any WSL Entity. All third parties
       associated with a WSL Digital Site with whom WSL may share Personal
       Data are bound by their own privacy and data collection and
       protection practices. WSL cannot be held liable for the policies or
       actions of such third parties. We encourage users to read the
       privacy policy of any click-thru site they visit through a WSL
       Digital Site.

5. Accuracy, Completeness and Deletion requests

     * WSL will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your
       Personal Data is kept accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If any of
       the Personal Data WSL holds about you is inaccurate, incomplete or
       out-of-date, please contact WSL immediately using the contact
       details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
     * WSL shall recognize any valid requests from individuals to delete
       their Personal Data from use for any reason and has systems and
       procedures in place to comply with a request for deletion. Any such
       requests should be made by contacting WSL directly using the
       contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.

6. Other people's information which you provide to WSL

   If you provide Personal Data to WSL about someone else, such as your
   agent or next of kin, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose
   such information to WSL and that WSL can collect, use and disclose such
   information for the purposes described above without being required to
   do anything else under relevant privacy laws (which may include laws of
   a country they are from or in which they reside). You should take
   reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the
   contents of this Privacy Policy as those matters relate to them. You
   warrant that any information you disclose is true and correct.

7. Unsolicited Submissions and Feedback

   Please be aware that WSL does not accept unsolicited submissions of
   concepts, creative ideas, suggestions, stories, scripts, or other
   potential creative content (“Unsolicited Submissions”). This is to
   avoid the possibility of future misunderstanding when projects
   developed by WSL staff or representatives might seem to others to be
   similar to their submitted concepts, creative ideas, suggestions,
   stories, scripts, or other potential creative content. Therefore,
   please do not send WSL any Unsolicited Submissions. In the event you do
   send WSL an Unsolicited Submission, you understand and agree that your
   Unsolicited Submission does not create any fiduciary relationship
   between you and WSL and that WSL is under no obligation to refrain from
   using the Unsolicited Submission (in whole or in part), to keep it
   confidential, or to compensate you for WSL’s use of it.

8. Security and Retention of your Personal Data

     * Personal Data the WSL holds is stored either in hard copy documents
       or as electronic data. WSL uses generally accepted industry
       standard reasonable security measures to protect any Personal Data
       held in any form from misuse, loss, unauthorized access,
       modification and/or disclosure.
     * Your membership on a WSL Digital Site is password protected and we
       recommend that you do not divulge your passwords to anyone. You are
       solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member name,
       password and other account information.
     * Any information posted or disclosed on a message board or comment
       section may be viewed and used by other members of the public. If
       you post any Personal Data in a publicly accessible area of a WSL
       Digital Site, you do so at your own risk and WSL accepts no
       liability for the same.
     * WSL shall retain your Personal Data only so long as it is necessary
       for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your
       account or membership is active. We respect requests we receive
       from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights
       in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We reserve the
       right to keep certain information in our archives that we deem
       necessary to comply with any legal obligations we may have, resolve
       disputes and enforce contractual agreements.

       instructions on how to prevent delivery of tailored advertising to
       your mobile device. Please also review your mobile device’s privacy
       settings and support materials if you wish to opt-out of tailored

10. Social Networking

     * You may use certain third-party social networking services,

       information about your experience on the WSL Digital Sites with
       your friends and followers on those social networking services.
       These social networking services may be able to collect information
       about you, including your activity on the WSL Digital Sites. These
       third-party social networking services also may notify your
       friends, both on the WSL Digital Sites and on the social networking
       services themselves, that you are a user of the WSL Digital Sites
       or about your use of the WSL Digital Sites, in accordance with
       applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to
       access or make use of third-party social networking services, we
       may receive information about you that you have made available to
       those social networking services, including information about your
       contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions
       with those social networking services are governed by the privacy
       policy of the company providing the relevant service.
     * You also may be able to link an account from a social networking
       service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Instagram) to your account on the
       WSL Digital Sites. This may allow you to use your credentials from
       the other site or service to sign in to certain features on the WSL
       Digital Sites. If you link your account from a third-party site or
       service, we may collect information from those third-party
       accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by
       this Privacy Policy.

   services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are
   not under WSL’s control or maintained by WSL. Such links do not
   constitute an endorsement by WSL of those other websites, the content
   displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.
   This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third- party websites. We
   encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party
   websites or services.

     * While every effort is made to comply with the laws and regulations
       of all jurisdictions in which the WSL Digital Sites may be accessed
       please be advised that the WSL Digital Sites are directed towards
       users who reside in the United States. The servers on which data is
       stored, including any Personal Data, are located in the United
       States, and the WSL Digital Sites comply with relevant laws and
       regulations under Californian law, as explained in this Privacy
       Policy. By continuing to use the WSL Digital Sites you hereby
       consent to your information being collected, stored, and used in
       the United States, as stated in this Privacy Policy.
     * If you are located in the European Economic Area or the European
       Union or a country with data protection and/or privacy laws which
       are different from those in the state of California, please be
       advised that we may transfer your Personal Data to countries that
       may not guarantee the same level of protection for Personal Data as
       the one in which you reside.
     * WSL will only transfer or share Personal Data to the extent it is
       necessary to fulfill the purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy
       and your data will be processed in accordance with the provisions
       set out in this Privacy Policy.

       request, please send an email to support@worldsurfleague.com or
       write to us at the address listed below.
     * Some web browsers transmit a ‘do not track’ signal or such similar
       signals to websites that a user may visit or interact with. At
       present, there is no recognized industry standard concerning what
       action, if any, a website provider must take with respect to such
       ‘do not track’ signals. As such, please be advised that, at
       present, the WSL Digital Sites do not take any action in response
       to such signals.

15. Changes to this Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 25, 2018, and will remain in

   These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without

   that the Federal Arbitration Act will apply as described below. By
   using the WSL Website in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree
   that:(A) Any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort,
   or otherwise) You may have against WSL arising out of, relating to, or
   connected in any way with the WSL Website or the determination of the
   scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
   exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and
   conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of
   JAMS, except that either party may bring any applicable claim in small
   claims court. (B)This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a
   transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the
   Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. (C) The arbitration
   shall be held in Los Angeles, California.(D) The arbitrator’s decision
   shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
   any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user
   may have entered into in connection with the WSL Website. (F) There
   shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or

   cost-prohibitive. (J) With the exception of (F) above, if any part of
   this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
   illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the
   balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall
   be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
   unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained
   herein. If, however, subpart (f) is found to be invalid, unenforceable
   or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be
   null and void, and neither you nor WSL shall be entitled to arbitrate
   their dispute.

   obligation to check for updates. Updates do not apply retroactively.

   document or terms and conditions referred to herein constitute the
   entire agreement of the parties with respect to Your use of the WSL
   Website, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between
