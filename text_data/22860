Amazon inaugurates world's largest campus in Hyderabad

   PTI | Updated: Aug 21, 2019, 18:03 IST
   US-based e-commerce giant Amazon on Wednesday inaugurated its new
   campus in Hyderabad - its largest facility globally - that will house
   15,000 of its employees in India. With 15,000 work points across 1.8
   million sq ft in office space, the building contains over 2.5 times
   more steel than the Eiffel Tower, measured by weight, and is spread
   over 9.5 acres of land.

   HYDERABAD: US-based e-commerce giant Amazon on Wednesday inaugurated
   its new campus here - its largest facility globally - that will house
   15,000 of its employees in India. The campus building contains over 2.5
   times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, measured by weight, and is
   spread over 9.5 acres of land.
   With 15,000 work points across 1.8 million sq ft in office space, built
   on 3 million sq ft of construction area - this is Amazon's single
   largest building in the world in terms of total area, said Amazon vice
   president of Global Real Estate and Facilities John Schoettler.
   "We have eight buildings in Hyderabad with 4 million sq ft of office
   space. We are going to be migrating some of the employees out of some
   of those facilities (to the new campus). So far as of today, we moved
   around 4,500 to the (new campus). The building can hold - at any given
   point of time - 15,000 people," he told reporters here.
   This is the only Amazon-owned campus outside the US. The move
   strengthens Amazon's focus on talent in India, where the company has
   over 62,000 full-time employees.
   "It (Hyderabad campus) is also the largest technology base outside
   Seattle (Amazon's headquarters). The employees (in Hyderabad) include
   software development engineers, machine learning scientists, product
   managers, finance and many other functions," Amazon India senior VP and
   country manager Amit Agarwal said.
   Amazon had laid the foundation stone for the campus building on March
   30, 2016. An average of 2,000 workers were on the site every day for 39
   months to construct the building, spending 18 million man-hours.
   The company, which is locked in an intense battle for market leadership
   in India with Walmart-owned Flipkart, has also focussed on
   sustainability while designing the new facility.
   The campus has more than 300 trees dotting its grounds with three
   specimen trees aged over 200 years and has an 850,000-litre water
   recycling plant, Schoettler said.
   Amazon has three fulfilment centres in Telangana offering more than 3.2
   million cubic feet of storage space to sellers, two sort centres with
   one lakh sq ft of processing capacity and 90 delivery stations, a
   statement said.
   Emphasising the company's commitment to the Indian market, Agarwal said
   it has already announced $5 billion investments in India, and another
   $500 million in food and retail.
   "We continue to invest across all over businesses," he added.
   He said the company has not seen a slowdown in its business in India.
   "As far as our services go, we don't see any slowdown. There could be
   multiple reasons. I think one thing to keep in mind is that e-commerce
   is very, very small...it is probably just 3 per cent (of total retail).
   When you are that small, there is so much room to grow," he said.
   Agarwal said the company had launched its Global Selling programme in
   India a few years ago that allows small and medium businesses in the
   country to sell to customers in other countries.
   "What we have seen is while we have 500,000 sellers in the marketplace
   selling nationally, for exports already we have 50,000 signed up. We
   have 140 million items that are available on Amazon.com in the global
   marketplaces. The cumulative exports so far since launch has crossed $1
   billion and in the next three years, it is expected to go 5 times to $5
   billion," he said.

80% of Chennai was wetland in 1980s, now 15%

   CHENNAI: It has always been an open secret, discussed and debated after
   the December floods last year. But now it has emerged that as the city
   expanded, more than 150 water bodies, that were part of a flood
   mitigating system in the city and its suburbs, were encroached and
   turned into human habitation. The result was there to see: Plum real
   estate ventures in Mudichur and Tambaram went under water.
   According to a study done by CareEarth Trust (a Chennai-based
   biodiversity research organisation), only 15% of the city's wetlands
   are left, down from the 80% when Chennai's area was lesser. The
   researcher, Prem V , has analysed the spatiotemporal variations,
   specially focussing on wetland and built-up land of the Chennai
   metropolitan area from 1980 to 2010.
   As per the findings, the built-up area of the city was 47.62sqkm in
   1980, only 20%, while the wetlands were spread over 186.30sqkm (see
   maps). In 1991, the built-up area increased three-fold, 152.33sqkm, and
   almost equalled the wetland spread which in the 11 years had come down
   to 159.41sqkm.
   The IT boom at the turn of the millennium triggered a construction boom
   in the southern parts of the city to accommodate offices; and to house
   techies the real estate business flourished in the vicinity. Over the
   years, the city expanded and outskirts like OMR and Perungudi
   transformed. As concrete replaced the shrublands and dry lake beds, the
   built-up area increased. In 2000, it was 250.58sqkm (68%) when compared
   to the 117.48sqkm of the wetlands. A decade later, the built-up area
   touched 402.10sqkm (85%) and the wetlands had shrunk to 71.05sqkm
   (15%).
   The study found that most of the water bodies affected were in the
   southern and western suburbs. The areas where the water bodies were
   encroached, some institutionally, included Tambaram, Perungalathur,
   Vandalur, Ramapuram, Manappakkam, Valasaravakkam, Ambattur, Alandur and
   Adyar. Incidentally, several of these areas were hit hard by the
   December deluge.
   According to the study, buffer areas of a lake are the first casualties
   of rapid urbanisation. Known as odai porambokku and yeri porambokku in
   Tamil  meaning rivulet across a wasteland and lake on a wasteland
   respectively - these buffer areas connected lakes and drained excess
   water from one water body into another. These channels formed an
   integral part of a natural flood mitigating system, but over time, with
   the lakes dry, these were encroached upon, the study said. Also,
   pastoral land adjoining the lakes acted as floodplains during monsoon.
   With the channels and farmlands gone, flooding was imminent.
   As a conservation-oriented study, the research provides a road map for
   the government to protect the wetlands from further degradation. Six
   years ago the Union ministry of environment and forests enacted
   Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010. One of the key
   features of this legislation was powers vested in the state machinery
   to determine the “wise“ use of water bodies. This May, Tamil Nadu set
   up wetland authority to protect the water bodies. How effective it will
   be remains to be seen.

Forest officer crushed to death by mining mafia in Madhya Pradesh

   P Naveen | TNN | Updated: Sep 7, 2018, 13:35 IST

Highlights

     * A 40-year-old deputy ranger was crushed to death by sand mining
       mafia in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh.
     * The officer, identified as Subedar Singh Kushwa, was crushed under
       the wheels as he tried to stop the tractor.

   Policemen at the spot where the officer was allegedly crushed to death
   by sand mafia.
   BHOPAL: A 60-year-old deputy ranger of forest department was crushed to
   death by a tractor ferrying illegally mined sand in Morena district,
   Madhya Pradesh, on Friday morning. Police have registered a murder
   case.
   This is the same place where a young IPS officer, Narendra Kumar, was
   crushed to death in March 2012, while trying to check illegal mining.
   Three constables Atwal Singh Chouhan, Dharmendra Chouhan and Narendra
   Sharma also lost their lives in separate incidents in a short span
   while trying to check sand miners.
   the deceased has been identified as Subedar Singh Kushwah, a resident
   of Bhind district. He was posted at the Ghorna forest chowki under
   Civil Line police station area – located on Dholpur highway, 5 km from
   the Morena district headquarters, for the last two years.
   Kushwah’s retirement was due in June 2018 but he got extension under
   the new retirement policy introduced by Shivraj Singh Chouhan
   government, raising age limit from 60 years to 62.
   “Two people on motorcycle were trying to remove tyre bursting spikes
   that were kept on road by forest officials to stop tractors and trucks
   ferrying illegal sand. When Kushwah tried to stop them, he was hit by
   the speeding tractor from behind,” Morena SP Amit Sanghi told TOI
   adding a case of murder has been registered against the accused.
   Spike strips or spike boards installed on roads to stop movement of
   vehicles
   Those on motorcycle were escorting the tractor and are said to be
   associated with sand mining mafia. Forest officials had been using
   locally-designed spike strips or spike boards to impede or stop the
   movement of tractors puncturing their tires. In Morena it was a metal
   plate studded with spikes.
   Kushwah was on duty along with four other employees of the forest
   department when he spotted tractors ferrying illegally mined sand
   around 10.30 am. Sources say Kushwah got crushed under the wheels as he
   tried to stop the tractor. Incident has reportedly been captured in a
   CCTV camera.
   “Subedar Singh Kushwah got killed in a bid to stop the tractor. He died
   on the spot while person driving the tractor escaped,” said forest
   guard Bhagwan, who was at the spot.
   Illegal mining of stones and stone slabs is rampant in Morena and Bhind
   districts of Chambal region bordering Uttar Pradesh. IPS Narendra Kumar
   was killed while trying to stop a tractor trolley ferrying illegally
   mined stone in Morena district. Sand mining mafia is active in almost
   all MP districts, destroying river beds those get dried up in winter
   and peak summer. Many rivers in the state are facing threat due to
   rampant illegal mining in the state.
   NGT had been pulling up Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for
   the illegal sand mining going around Morena’s National Chambal
   Sanctuary, but state government has failed to control the mining
   activities. NGT had taken cognisance of a petition filed by NGO Tiger
   Protection Group which sought prevention of sand mining in and around
   the sanctuary claiming that the menace was contributing in destruction
   of the gharial habitat as the sandbanks are essential for its nesting
   purposes. Tribunal was informed that by large-scale illegal mining
   activities in these state, species of Gharial and red-crowned turtle
   are likely to become extinct.
   In June, 18 members of a family on their way to a condolence meet were
   killed and five others were injured when a tractor-trolley ferrying
   illegally-mined sand rammed into their jeep in Morena near Ganjrampur
   village. The victims, all from Gwalior district, were going to Ghurgan
   village for a condolence meeting. The driver of the tractor-trolley,
   carrying sand mined illegally from the National Chambal Sanctuary, fled
   the spot after the accident. A case was registered against him, he
   said, adding that a probe was on into the incident.

   The death has sparked off political slugfest with the Congress leader

   minister Shivraj Singh jumping in to defend his government and assuring
   that safety of journalists would be ensured at all costs. The Bhind
   Press Club has also demanded an impartial probe in the case.

   Sources said Sandeep had filed a complaint four months ago citing
   threat to his life from a police officer after a ‘sting operation’
   against him. Sources said Sandeep had filed a story accusing the
   officer of being hand in glove with the sand mafias. An audio
   conversation of the officer in question was aired by his channel after
   which the officer was transferred, said sources.

   Sharma’s two-wheeler was hit by the truck from behind killing him on
   the spot around 9 am, just a few meters away from the Kotwali police
   station. The truck was found abandoned a few kilometres away. A CCTV
   footage that surfaced within a few minutes of the crime shows Sharma
   riding a motorbike which vanishes under a truck that mows him down on a
   busy stretch in the Bhind town.
   “CCTV footage shows the bike overtaking the dumper on the left and then
   turning to the right. Dumper driver would not have seen the bike till
   it swerved and came in front,” said a policeman wishing anonymity.
   Sharma is survived by his wife and two children aged 14 and 15 years.
   Sharma’s death triggered a panic among other journalists in the region.
   It is alleged that police responded after 15 to 20 minutes despite the
   spot being a few meters from the police station.

     India to launch first manned space mission by 2022: PM Modi

India to launch first manned space mission by 2022: PM Modi

   Chethan Kumar | TNN | Updated: Aug 15, 2018, 14:22 IST

   Tricolour will be hoisted in space by 2022: PM Narendra Modi

Highlights

     * India will launch first manned space mission by 2022 or earlier, PM
       Modi said in his Independence Day speech.
     * This could make India the fourth nation to send a human in space.

   NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, as part
   of his Independence Day speech,
   vowed to put an Indian in space by 2022
   .
   "When India celebrates 75th year of Independence in 2022, and if
   possible even before, an Indian son or daughter will undertake a manned
   space mission on board 'Gaganyaan' carrying the national flag," the PM
   announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This would make India the
   fourth nation to send a human in space after the United States, Russia
   and China.
   However, the proposed human spaceflight programme (HSP), something that
   has been on the table since 2004, is still a long way away despite
   advancements in some critical technologies in the past decade.

   Day address at Red Fort
   The original plan was realising a Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) fully
   reusable launch vehicle, which could carry two-three people into low
   earth orbit and bring them back. The UPA government had sanctioned Rs
   145 crore for pre-launch activities and Isro is expected to get more
   funding in the coming months following Modi's announcement today.
   As of today, there is no actual estimation in public domain, but
   insiders say that it needs a budget of at least Rs 10,000 crore to Rs
   12,000 crore.
   As part of the preparations, Isro has been testing some technologies,
   an important one involving the crew escape system- a key system being
   developed as part of the proposed HSP- was tested on July 5.
   The space agency tested the Crew Escape System (CES) for its crew
   capsule in an emergency pad abort test (PAT) in Sriharikota. The test,
   which lasted 4.31 minutes, involved aborting the space capsule at
   launch.
   The Crew Escape System is an emergency escape measure designed to
   quickly pull the crew module along with the astronauts to a safe
   distance from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch abort. The
   first test (Pad Abort Test) demonstrated the safe recovery of the crew
   module in case of any exigency at the launch pad.
   This was a second major test after it successfully launched a crew
   module with dummy payloads and brought it back on to the Arabian Sea.
   Isro has already completed successful tests of the scaled down version
   of the Re-usable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD), and
   is preparing for two major experiments in 2019 - one will involve using
   a helicopter, while the second and major one would be the orbital
   re-entry test.
   The space agency has completed the wind tunnel model with landing gear
   and low subsonic tests at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur
   (IIT-K). For the orbital re-entry test, Isro has proposed to design and
   develop a scaled-up version of RLV.
   "You must understand that this won't be the actual RLV, but a model,"
   Isro chairman K Sivan said at a press conference he had convened on
   August 12.
   Speaking separately with TOI, Sivan said that they are yet to finalise
   the landing site for the experiment. "There are options in Challakere,
   one place in Rajasthan and another forward post, there is no final
   decision yet. The important thing would be to select a place that will
   have no habitation around the landing site. This is an experimental
   test and we need to take all precautions," he said.
   All these technologies are crucial for the manned mission, and these
   are just some of the early stage experiments. Sivan has said that Isro
   was in the process of preparing a revised report on the preparations of
   the project.
   The said report is to be purely an internal document, with no other
   potential stakeholder involved. "We are making a few changes...it is
   purely an internal document and there's no other agency involved at
   this moment," Sivan had said on July 7, at the sidelights of the LM
   Katre Memorial Lecture.
   Answering a specific question on HSP, Sivan had said: "It is our
   imagination, our dream that it should happen. But right now we are only
   in the preparations stage where we are demonstrating critical
   technologies, there's a lot to do."
   Stating that Isro always anticipates and develop technologies for the
   future even before a project is on the cards, he said that the HSP is
   one such programme.
   Conceding that there is still a long way to go, Sivan had said Isro was
   yet to even decide which rocket-GSLV MK-II or GSLV MK-III-it will use
   if the HSP gets the green signal from the government.
   "We are working on several combinations," he had said. But experts and
   some Isro insiders TOI has been speaking with suggest that neither of
   the two rockets are man-rated yet. Insiders say that if India does
   launch people into space, it can only do it with the GSLV MK-III, and
   that too an advanced version of it, which the agency must now build and
   master with virtually no errors.

   president of Global Real Estate and Facilities John Schoettler.
   "We have eight buildings in Hyderabad with 4 million sq ft of office
   space. We are going to be migrating some of the employees out of some
   of those facilities (to the new campus). So far as of today, we moved
   around 4,500 to the (new campus). The building can hold - at any given
   point of time - 15,000 people," he told reporters here.
   This is the only Amazon-owned campus outside the US. The move
   strengthens Amazon's focus on talent in India, where the company has
   over 62,000 full-time employees.
   "It (Hyderabad campus) is also the largest technology base outside
   Seattle (Amazon's headquarters). The employees (in Hyderabad) include
   software development engineers, machine learning scientists, product
   managers, finance and many other functions," Amazon India senior VP and
   country manager Amit Agarwal said.
   Amazon had laid the foundation stone for the campus building on March
   30, 2016. An average of 2,000 workers were on the site every day for 39
   months to construct the building, spending 18 million man-hours.
   The company, which is locked in an intense battle for market leadership
   in India with Walmart-owned Flipkart, has also focussed on
   sustainability while designing the new facility.
   The campus has more than 300 trees dotting its grounds with three
   specimen trees aged over 200 years and has an 850,000-litre water
   recycling plant, Schoettler said.
   Amazon has three fulfilment centres in Telangana offering more than 3.2
   million cubic feet of storage space to sellers, two sort centres with
   one lakh sq ft of processing capacity and 90 delivery stations, a
   statement said.
   Emphasising the company's commitment to the Indian market, Agarwal said
   it has already announced $5 billion investments in India, and another
   $500 million in food and retail.
   "We continue to invest across all over businesses," he added.
   He said the company has not seen a slowdown in its business in India.
   "As far as our services go, we don't see any slowdown. There could be
   multiple reasons. I think one thing to keep in mind is that e-commerce
   is very, very small...it is probably just 3 per cent (of total retail).
   When you are that small, there is so much room to grow," he said.
   Agarwal said the company had launched its Global Selling programme in
   India a few years ago that allows small and medium businesses in the
   country to sell to customers in other countries.
   "What we have seen is while we have 500,000 sellers in the marketplace
   selling nationally, for exports already we have 50,000 signed up. We
   have 140 million items that are available on Amazon.com in the global
   marketplaces. The cumulative exports so far since launch has crossed $1
   billion and in the next three years, it is expected to go 5 times to $5
   billion," he said.

     80% of Chennai was wetland in 1980s, now 15%

   This story is from September 5, 2016

80% of Chennai was wetland in 1980s, now 15%

   P Oppili | TNN | Updated: Sep 5, 2016, 11:54 IST

   CHENNAI: It has always been an open secret, discussed and debated after
   the December floods last year. But now it has emerged that as the city
   expanded, more than 150 water bodies, that were part of a flood
   mitigating system in the city and its suburbs, were encroached and
   turned into human habitation. The result was there to see: Plum real
   estate ventures in Mudichur and Tambaram went under water.
   According to a study done by CareEarth Trust (a Chennai-based
   biodiversity research organisation), only 15% of the city's wetlands
   are left, down from the 80% when Chennai's area was lesser. The
   researcher, Prem V , has analysed the spatiotemporal variations,
   specially focussing on wetland and built-up land of the Chennai
   metropolitan area from 1980 to 2010.
   As per the findings, the built-up area of the city was 47.62sqkm in
   1980, only 20%, while the wetlands were spread over 186.30sqkm (see
   maps). In 1991, the built-up area increased three-fold, 152.33sqkm, and
   almost equalled the wetland spread which in the 11 years had come down
   to 159.41sqkm.
   The IT boom at the turn of the millennium triggered a construction boom
   in the southern parts of the city to accommodate offices; and to house
   techies the real estate business flourished in the vicinity. Over the
   years, the city expanded and outskirts like OMR and Perungudi
   transformed. As concrete replaced the shrublands and dry lake beds, the
   built-up area increased. In 2000, it was 250.58sqkm (68%) when compared
   to the 117.48sqkm of the wetlands. A decade later, the built-up area
   touched 402.10sqkm (85%) and the wetlands had shrunk to 71.05sqkm
   (15%).
   The study found that most of the water bodies affected were in the
   southern and western suburbs. The areas where the water bodies were
   encroached, some institutionally, included Tambaram, Perungalathur,
   Vandalur, Ramapuram, Manappakkam, Valasaravakkam, Ambattur, Alandur and
   Adyar. Incidentally, several of these areas were hit hard by the
   December deluge.
   According to the study, buffer areas of a lake are the first casualties
   of rapid urbanisation. Known as odai porambokku and yeri porambokku in
   Tamil  meaning rivulet across a wasteland and lake on a wasteland
   respectively - these buffer areas connected lakes and drained excess
   water from one water body into another. These channels formed an
   integral part of a natural flood mitigating system, but over time, with
   the lakes dry, these were encroached upon, the study said. Also,
   pastoral land adjoining the lakes acted as floodplains during monsoon.
   With the channels and farmlands gone, flooding was imminent.
   As a conservation-oriented study, the research provides a road map for
   the government to protect the wetlands from further degradation. Six
   years ago the Union ministry of environment and forests enacted
   Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010. One of the key
   features of this legislation was powers vested in the state machinery
   to determine the “wise“ use of water bodies. This May, Tamil Nadu set
   up wetland authority to protect the water bodies. How effective it will
   be remains to be seen.

Forest officer crushed to death by mining mafia in Madhya Pradesh

   P Naveen | TNN | Updated: Sep 7, 2018, 13:35 IST

Highlights

     * A 40-year-old deputy ranger was crushed to death by sand mining
       mafia in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh.
     * The officer, identified as Subedar Singh Kushwa, was crushed under
       the wheels as he tried to stop the tractor.

   Policemen at the spot where the officer was allegedly crushed to death
   by sand mafia.
   BHOPAL: A 60-year-old deputy ranger of forest department was crushed to
   death by a tractor ferrying illegally mined sand in Morena district,
   Madhya Pradesh, on Friday morning. Police have registered a murder
   case.
   This is the same place where a young IPS officer, Narendra Kumar, was
   crushed to death in March 2012, while trying to check illegal mining.
   Three constables Atwal Singh Chouhan, Dharmendra Chouhan and Narendra
   Sharma also lost their lives in separate incidents in a short span
   while trying to check sand miners.
   the deceased has been identified as Subedar Singh Kushwah, a resident
   of Bhind district. He was posted at the Ghorna forest chowki under
   Civil Line police station area – located on Dholpur highway, 5 km from
   the Morena district headquarters, for the last two years.
   Kushwah’s retirement was due in June 2018 but he got extension under
   the new retirement policy introduced by Shivraj Singh Chouhan
   government, raising age limit from 60 years to 62.
   “Two people on motorcycle were trying to remove tyre bursting spikes
   that were kept on road by forest officials to stop tractors and trucks
   ferrying illegal sand. When Kushwah tried to stop them, he was hit by
   the speeding tractor from behind,” Morena SP Amit Sanghi told TOI
   adding a case of murder has been registered against the accused.
   Spike strips or spike boards installed on roads to stop movement of
   vehicles
   Those on motorcycle were escorting the tractor and are said to be
   associated with sand mining mafia. Forest officials had been using
   locally-designed spike strips or spike boards to impede or stop the
   movement of tractors puncturing their tires. In Morena it was a metal
   plate studded with spikes.
   Kushwah was on duty along with four other employees of the forest
   department when he spotted tractors ferrying illegally mined sand
   around 10.30 am. Sources say Kushwah got crushed under the wheels as he
   tried to stop the tractor. Incident has reportedly been captured in a
   CCTV camera.
   “Subedar Singh Kushwah got killed in a bid to stop the tractor. He died
   on the spot while person driving the tractor escaped,” said forest
   guard Bhagwan, who was at the spot.
   Illegal mining of stones and stone slabs is rampant in Morena and Bhind
   districts of Chambal region bordering Uttar Pradesh. IPS Narendra Kumar
   was killed while trying to stop a tractor trolley ferrying illegally
   mined stone in Morena district. Sand mining mafia is active in almost
   all MP districts, destroying river beds those get dried up in winter
   and peak summer. Many rivers in the state are facing threat due to
   rampant illegal mining in the state.
   NGT had been pulling up Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for
   the illegal sand mining going around Morena’s National Chambal
   Sanctuary, but state government has failed to control the mining
   activities. NGT had taken cognisance of a petition filed by NGO Tiger
   Protection Group which sought prevention of sand mining in and around
   the sanctuary claiming that the menace was contributing in destruction
   of the gharial habitat as the sandbanks are essential for its nesting
   purposes. Tribunal was informed that by large-scale illegal mining
   activities in these state, species of Gharial and red-crowned turtle
   are likely to become extinct.
   In June, 18 members of a family on their way to a condolence meet were
   killed and five others were injured when a tractor-trolley ferrying
   illegally-mined sand rammed into their jeep in Morena near Ganjrampur
   village. The victims, all from Gwalior district, were going to Ghurgan
   village for a condolence meeting. The driver of the tractor-trolley,
   carrying sand mined illegally from the National Chambal Sanctuary, fled
   the spot after the accident. A case was registered against him, he
   said, adding that a probe was on into the incident.

   Sandeep Sharma
   BHOPAL: A 35-year-old journalist investigating illegal sand mining
   cases in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh was run over by a truck on
   Monday morning. Identified as Sandeep Sharma, the journalist was
   working with a regional news channel.

   The death has sparked off political slugfest with the Congress leader
   Jyotiraditya Scindia demanding a CBI probe into the case and chief
   minister Shivraj Singh jumping in to defend his government and assuring
   that safety of journalists would be ensured at all costs. The Bhind
   Press Club has also demanded an impartial probe in the case.

   Sources said Sandeep had filed a complaint four months ago citing
   threat to his life from a police officer after a ‘sting operation’
   against him. Sources said Sandeep had filed a story accusing the
   officer of being hand in glove with the sand mafias. An audio
   conversation of the officer in question was aired by his channel after
   which the officer was transferred, said sources.

   Sharma’s two-wheeler was hit by the truck from behind killing him on
   the spot around 9 am, just a few meters away from the Kotwali police
   station. The truck was found abandoned a few kilometres away. A CCTV
   footage that surfaced within a few minutes of the crime shows Sharma
   riding a motorbike which vanishes under a truck that mows him down on a
   busy stretch in the Bhind town.
   “CCTV footage shows the bike overtaking the dumper on the left and then
   turning to the right. Dumper driver would not have seen the bike till
   it swerved and came in front,” said a policeman wishing anonymity.
   Sharma is survived by his wife and two children aged 14 and 15 years.
   Sharma’s death triggered a panic among other journalists in the region.
   It is alleged that police responded after 15 to 20 minutes despite the
   spot being a few meters from the police station.

India to launch first manned space mission by 2022: PM Modi

   Chethan Kumar | TNN | Updated: Aug 15, 2018, 14:22 IST

   Tricolour will be hoisted in space by 2022: PM Narendra Modi

Highlights

     * India will launch first manned space mission by 2022 or earlier, PM
       Modi said in his Independence Day speech.
     * This could make India the fourth nation to send a human in space.

   NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, as part
   of his Independence Day speech,
   vowed to put an Indian in space by 2022
   .
   "When India celebrates 75th year of Independence in 2022, and if
   possible even before, an Indian son or daughter will undertake a manned
   space mission on board 'Gaganyaan' carrying the national flag," the PM
   announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This would make India the
   fourth nation to send a human in space after the United States, Russia
   and China.
   However, the proposed human spaceflight programme (HSP), something that
   has been on the table since 2004, is still a long way away despite
   advancements in some critical technologies in the past decade.

   Day address at Red Fort
   The original plan was realising a Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) fully
   reusable launch vehicle, which could carry two-three people into low
   earth orbit and bring them back. The UPA government had sanctioned Rs
   145 crore for pre-launch activities and Isro is expected to get more
   funding in the coming months following Modi's announcement today.
   As of today, there is no actual estimation in public domain, but
   insiders say that it needs a budget of at least Rs 10,000 crore to Rs
   12,000 crore.
   As part of the preparations, Isro has been testing some technologies,
   an important one involving the crew escape system- a key system being
   developed as part of the proposed HSP- was tested on July 5.
   The space agency tested the Crew Escape System (CES) for its crew
   capsule in an emergency pad abort test (PAT) in Sriharikota. The test,
   which lasted 4.31 minutes, involved aborting the space capsule at
   launch.
   The Crew Escape System is an emergency escape measure designed to
   quickly pull the crew module along with the astronauts to a safe
   distance from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch abort. The
   first test (Pad Abort Test) demonstrated the safe recovery of the crew
   module in case of any exigency at the launch pad.
   This was a second major test after it successfully launched a crew
   module with dummy payloads and brought it back on to the Arabian Sea.
   Isro has already completed successful tests of the scaled down version
   of the Re-usable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD), and
   is preparing for two major experiments in 2019 - one will involve using
   a helicopter, while the second and major one would be the orbital
   re-entry test.
   The space agency has completed the wind tunnel model with landing gear
   and low subsonic tests at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur
   (IIT-K). For the orbital re-entry test, Isro has proposed to design and
   develop a scaled-up version of RLV.
   "You must understand that this won't be the actual RLV, but a model,"
   Isro chairman K Sivan said at a press conference he had convened on
   August 12.
   Speaking separately with TOI, Sivan said that they are yet to finalise
   the landing site for the experiment. "There are options in Challakere,
   one place in Rajasthan and another forward post, there is no final
   decision yet. The important thing would be to select a place that will
   have no habitation around the landing site. This is an experimental
   test and we need to take all precautions," he said.
   All these technologies are crucial for the manned mission, and these
   are just some of the early stage experiments. Sivan has said that Isro
   was in the process of preparing a revised report on the preparations of
   the project.
   The said report is to be purely an internal document, with no other
   potential stakeholder involved. "We are making a few changes...it is
   purely an internal document and there's no other agency involved at
   this moment," Sivan had said on July 7, at the sidelights of the LM
   Katre Memorial Lecture.
   Answering a specific question on HSP, Sivan had said: "It is our
   imagination, our dream that it should happen. But right now we are only
   in the preparations stage where we are demonstrating critical
   technologies, there's a lot to do."
   Stating that Isro always anticipates and develop technologies for the
   future even before a project is on the cards, he said that the HSP is
   one such programme.
   Conceding that there is still a long way to go, Sivan had said Isro was
   yet to even decide which rocket-GSLV MK-II or GSLV MK-III-it will use
   if the HSP gets the green signal from the government.
   "We are working on several combinations," he had said. But experts and
   some Isro insiders TOI has been speaking with suggest that neither of
   the two rockets are man-rated yet. Insiders say that if India does
   launch people into space, it can only do it with the GSLV MK-III, and
   that too an advanced version of it, which the agency must now build and
   master with virtually no errors.

Gaganyaan mission: IAF to pick 10 potential astronauts in 2 months, Isro
chief says

   Surendra Singh | TNN | Updated: Jun 12, 2019, 4:25 IST

Highlights

     * Air Force will screen and select 10 potential crew members for
       India's first manned space mission in two months
     * Isro chairman K Sivan said that the space agency will choose the
       final three astronauts from the ten people who the IAF would train
     * India's first manned space mission is slated for early 2021

   The Indian Air Force (IAF) will “screen and select 10 potential crew
   members for the country’s first manned space mission in two months”.
   Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman K Sivan told TOI
   that the space agency will choose the final three astronauts from the
   ten people who the IAF would train.
   The Isro chief said, “We have an agreement with the IAF for crew
   training at Isro’s Human Space Flight Centre in Bengaluru. IAF will
   screen around 10 crew members for the mission. This screening and
   selection will happen within one to two months. Isro will finally
   choose three members from these 10 crew members for the human
   spaceflight mission.”
   Preparations for the country’s first manned mission to space are in
   full swing as Isro recently held its first meeting of the national
   advisory council (NAC), where representatives of all organisations and
   institutes involved in the Gaganyaan project participated. The agency
   also tested CE-20 engine, meant for the upper stage of human-rated GSLV
   MK-III, which will be carrying Indian astronauts to space.
   Speaking to TOI, Sivan said, “In the NAC meet on June 8, Air
   Vice-Marshal R G K Kapoor, assistant chief of air staff operations
   (space), Rear Admiral D S Gujarl, assistant chief of naval staff,
   Defence Research and Development Organisation director G Satheesh
   Reddy, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited chairman and managing director R
   Madhavan and veterans of different institutes attended the meeting. All
   these agencies will play crucial roles in the mission. Whilel the IAF
   will handle crew selection and training, DRDO will provide the life
   support system for crew and Navy will help in recovering the human
   capsule once it re-enters the atmosphere and splashes down in sea.”
   The Isro chairman said the meeting, also attended by former Indian
   astronaut Rakesh Sharma, discussed the overall plan, including crew
   training. “The NAC is mandated to meet once in six months to review the
   preparedness of the mission (scheduled to be launched before or by
   2021). But we have decided to initially hold the review meeting once in
   three months in order to streamline the process,” he said.
   On the Chandrayaan-2 mission, Sivan said “the integration of GSLV Mk
   III has been going on at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota for
   quite some time. However, the lunarcraft will be on display at
   Bengaluru’s U R Rao Satellite Centre for the media for the next two
   days before being taken to Sriharikota for integration with the GSLV
   rocket”.

     Gaganyaan: India chooses Russia to pick & train astronauts

Gaganyaan: India chooses Russia to pick & train astronauts

   Chethan Kumar | TNN | Updated: Jul 1, 2019, 23:29 IST

   BENGALURU: Even as India and the US spar over the former’s defence
   contracts with Russia, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro)
   has finally signed the agreement to get its astronauts for the proposed
   Gaganyaan mission trained in Russia, even as other countries including
   the US and France were being considered initially.
   Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI in March that the agency was most likely
   to pick Russia given that the two agencies have had previous
   experience—Russian took India’s Rakesh Sharma to space—and the
   Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) under the Indian Air Force (IAF)
   has also worked with Russia.
   Rakesh Sharma, who is also a member of the National Advisory Council
   (NAC) advising Isro on the Gaganyaan mission, told TOI: “I think it’s
   logical to go with Russia as it has been tried and tested. We’ve used
   the facility before and therefore it makes eminent sense. Although I am
   unaware of the state of readiness of the other training establishments.
   And, given the tight timelines that we have this appears most logical.”
   On Monday, Natalia Lokteva, first deputy director general, Glavkosmos—a
   subsidiary of Roscosmos State Corporation (Russia’s space agency)—and S
   Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) of Isro,
   signed a contract for “selection support, medical examination and space
   training of Indian astronauts.”
   An official statement issued by Glavkosmos confirming the contract,
   read: “Glavkosmos will render to HSFC services on consulting support of
   selection of candidates for the Indian astronauts, providing medical
   examination of the candidates for access to space flight related
   training program and providing space flight related training for the
   Indian astronauts selected on the basis of the medical examination,”
   said in a statement released Monday.
   The work will be provided with the support of the Federal State Budget
   Organization, UA Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center, and
   the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences.
   “As part of the documents we had given IAF we had described the kind of
   requirement and involvement of foreign agencies for training and so on…
   The training will be at three levels. After the rigorous selection
   progress, two levels of training will be done at IAM and the third
   level will be done abroad. Simulation of the real space environment,
   parabolic flights and training in the spacecraft et al will be done
   abroad,” Sivan had earlier told TOI.
   Russia also trains astronauts from across the world seeking to go the
   near earth orbits. “As you well know that presently the only access to
   space to near earth orbit is provided by the Russians. And therefore no
   matter which crew goes up into orbit, the final training is done in
   Russia as they have to equip themselves with the systems of the Russian
   spacecraft,” Sharma said.
   Isro established the HSFC to develop life support systems, crew
   training and planning for future missions under Gaganyaan.
   During his visit in September 2018, Jean-Yves Le Gall, president,
   French space agency—Centro Nacional de Estudios Espaciales (CNES)—
   announced a working group for Gaganyaan and told said that there are a
   lot of areas of human spaceflight that France has expertise in which it
   would like to offer. “We even have expertise in astronauts’ training,”
   Gall had told TOI, adding that the agency was keen on partnering with
   Isro.

Yes Bank shares continue to fall, tumble nearly 9 pc

   PTI | Aug 21, 2019, 16:31 IST

   Yes Bank shares continue to fall, tumble nearly 9 pc
   New Delhi, Aug 21 () Shares of Yes Bank on Wednesday also tumbled
   nearly 9 per cent amid concerns over its exposure to CG Power and
   Industrial Solutions which has been hit by alleged financial
   irregularities and unauthorised transactions.

   The stock dropped 8.21 per cent to close at Rs 65.40 on the BSE. During
   the day, it tanked 9.47 per cent to Rs 64.50 -- its 52-week low.

   On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the company's shares plummeted
   8.63 per cent to close at Rs 65.05 apiece.

   As many as 155.93 lakh shares of the company were traded on the BSE and
   over 22 crore shares on the NSE during the day.

   Shares of Yes Bank on Tuesday also dropped over 7 per cent.

   Yes Bank has 12.79 per cent stake in CG Power as in the June 2019
   quarter on the BSE.

   "While working on one of its priority tasks of seeking refinancing of
   certain facilities and as part of conducting financial analysis in this
   regard, the Operations Committee was made aware of some unauthorised
   transactions by certain employees of the company," said CG Power in a
   BSE filing on Tuesday after a marathon meeting.

   The board also found that the total liabilities of the company and the
   group may have been potentially understated.
   The filing also said advances to related and unrelated parties of the
   company and the group may have been potentially understated. SUM HRS
