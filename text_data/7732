Tinyclues Accelerates Growth with Record Revenue and Customer Momentum

   Tinyclues, the leading Campaign Intelligence solution, used by major
   retail, travel & hospitality brands, grew annual revenue by more than
   70 percent in 2018, signed numerous new customers globally and extended
   operations to the Nordic and DACH regions.

   New York, London, Paris – February 06, 2019 – Tinyclues, provider of
   the leading AI-first marketing campaign intelligence solution, today
   revealed that in 2018 the company continued its rapid growth, fueled by
   $18M Series B funding in February 2018. With record annual recurring
   revenue, analyst recognition and more than 100 brands using Tinyclues
   to supercharge their marketing campaigns, the company is on a fast
   track to success. In 2018, new customers selecting Tinyclues to power
   their campaigns included Clarins, Camaieu, Perfect Stay, Road Scholar,
   Maty, Princesse Tam Tam, Carrefour Spectacles, Hostelworld, Weekendesk
   and many more.

   “Our revenue growth, global expansion and prestigious customer base
   mark Tinyclues as the leading AI-first solution for marketing campaign
   intelligence,” said David Bessis, founder and CEO of Tinyclues. “Thanks
   to our unique deep learning technology, we are solving one of the
   toughest problems marketers face – who will buy their products and when
   – allowing brands to reinvent the way they engage with their
   customers.”

   Bessis continued: “With Tinyclues, finding future buyers and optimizing
   the campaign plan is easier than ever, leading to outstanding increases
   in revenue, engagement and productivity. Marketers love Tinyclues, and
   I’m proud that they have given Tinyclues a stunning average Net
   Promoter Score (NPS) of 60 in 2018.”

   In addition to remarkable revenue growth and a raft of customer
   successes, 2018 highlights also include:
     * New investment for growth: Tinyclues closed an $18M Series B
       investment round. The lead investor was EQT Ventures, with
       participation from existing investors Alven, Elaia Partners and
       ISAI.
     * Launch of operations in Nordics and DACH: Tinyclues opened offices
       in Copenhagen and Munich with new customers already signed.
     * “Tinyworld” customer event success: More than 150 top marketers and
       influencers attended Tinyclues’ first global user conference,
       demonstrating the interest of global brands in the benefits of AI
       for marketing.
     * Analyst recognition: Tinyclues was named in Gartner’s “Cool Vendors
       in Multichannel Marketing” and “Hype Cycle for Digital Marketing &
       Advertising” 2018 reports. Tinyclues was also cited by Forrester in
       its reports “Complement Your EMSS with Best-Of-Breed Point
       Solutions,” and in “Artificial Intelligence Will Spark a Real
       Marketing Renaissance.”
     * Awards: Tinyclues received recognition from research leaders in the
       travel industry with an award for innovation from Phocuswright.
     * Omnichannel adoption: In 2018, customers accelerated their usage of
       Tinyclues on digital channels like push notifications and Facebook
       ads. Customers switching from Facebook Lookalike Audiences to
       Tinyclues averaged a 39 percent increase in Facebook ads revenue.
     * Customer satisfaction: Tinyclues’ Net Promoter Score (NPS) averaged
       a remarkable 60 in 2018.

   reinvent marketing campaigns and transform business. Tinyclues has a
   proven record of more than 100 brands with outstanding results on the
   most important marketing metrics: revenue, customer engagement and

   strategy, we look forward to changing the way B2C marketers worldwide
   are engaging with their customers.”
