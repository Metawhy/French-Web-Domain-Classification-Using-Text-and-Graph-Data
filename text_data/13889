Create High-End Facial Animations on your Own! Unrivalled Results
Award-Winning Technology More than 10 Years of Experience Real Time-Saver

Markerless facial motion capture

   Unsurpassed Raw Animation Production and Unique Real-Time Animation

Production Software

   Unlike traditional marker-based motion capture systems, which capture a
   very limited number of marker positions, Performer makes use of the
   whole facial image to track facial movements; every pixel of the face
   being used as a source of information.

Real-Time Software

   Dynamixyz provides a high-quality real-time animation solution thanks
   to its top-notch tracking module.

   Responding to customer feedback, our polished and actor-friendly design
   adjusts to fit well on any performer.

About Us

   Founded in April 2010, the success of Dynamixyz’ award-winning
   Performer software is the culmination of more than a decade of
   specializing in quality 3D face analysis and synthesis. The founders
   provide a strong core of R&D power to a constantly evolving market.
   Adding to a dedicated team of six PhD’s, leading research with one of
   the most famous French “Grande Ecole”, other team members also bring
   deep experience in computer programming and optimisation, international
   sales and partnership management.

   The Performer Solution is Dynamixyz’ award-winning video-based facial
   capture and analysis solution. Since 2003, Dynamixyz’ team of PhD’s and
   engineers have designed animation systems, provided real-time
   photorealistic skin rendering, and developed advanced motion capture
   systems. The challenge of capturing the human face has always been the
   team’s specialist focus and, as a result, Dynamixyz’ Performer Solution
   has proved to be one of the most stable markerless facial tracking
   systems in the world.
