New Cross-Industry Effort to Advance Computational Trust and Security for
Next-Generation Cloud and Edge Computing

   By The Linux Foundation August 21, 2019 Press Release
     * No Comments
     * 0

   Alibaba, Arm, Baidu, Google Cloud, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat,
   Swisscom and Tencent will collaborate on open source technologies and
   standards that accelerate the adoption of confidential computing

   SAN DIEGO, Calif., Open Source Summit, August 21, 2019 – The Linux
   Foundation today announced the intent to form the Confidential
   Computing Consortium, a community dedicated to defining and
   accelerating the adoption of confidential computing. Companies
   committed to this work include Alibaba, Arm, Baidu, Google Cloud, IBM,
   Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, Swisscom and Tencent.

   Across industries computing is moving to span multiple environments,
   from on premises to  public cloud to edge. As companies move these
   workloads to different environments, they need protection controls for
   sensitive IP and workload data and are increasingly seeking greater
   assurances and more transparency of these controls. Current approaches
   in cloud computing address data at rest and in transit but encrypting
   data in use is considered the third and possibly most challenging step
   to providing a fully encrypted lifecycle for sensitive data.
   Confidential computing will enable encrypted data to be processed in
   memory without exposing it to the rest of the system and reduce
   exposure for sensitive data and provide greater control and
   transparency for users.

   “The earliest work on technologies that have the ability to transform
   an industry is often done in collaboration across the industry and with
   open source technologies,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The
   Linux Foundation. “The Confidential Computing Consortium is a leading
   indicator of what’s to come for security in computing and will help
   define and build open technologies to support this trust infrastructure
   for data in use.”

   The Confidential Computing Consortium will bring together hardware
   vendors, cloud providers, developers, open source experts and academics
   to accelerate the confidential computing market; influence technical
   and regulatory standards; and build open source tools that provide the
   right environment for TEE development. The organization will also
   anchor industry outreach and education initiatives.

   Participants plan to make several open source project contributions to
   the Confidential Computing Consortium, including:
     * Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) Software Development
       Kit, designed to help application developers protect select code
       and data from disclosure or modification at the hardware layer
       using protected enclaves.
     * Microsoft Open Enclave SDK, an open source framework that allows
       developers to build Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
       applications using a single enclaving abstraction. Developers can
       build applications once that run across multiple TEE architectures.
     * Red Hat Enarx, a project providing hardware independence for
       securing applications using TEEs.

   The proposed structure for the Consortium includes a Governing Board, a
   Technical Advisory Council and separate technical oversight for each
   technical project. It is intended to host a variety of technical open
   source projects and open specifications to support confidential
   computing. Confidential Computing Consortium will be funded through
   membership dues. For more information and to contribute to the project,
   please visit: https://confidentialcomputing.io

   Supporting Quotes

   Alibaba
   “Confidential computing provides new capabilities for cloud customers
   to reduce trusted computing base in cloud environments and protect
   their data during runtime. Alibaba launched Alibaba Encrypted Computing
   technology powered by Intel SGX in Sep 2017 and has provided commercial
   cloud servers with SGX capability to our customers since April 2018. We
   are very excited to join CCC and work with the community to build a
   better confidential computing ecosystem,” said Xiaoning Li, chief
   security architect, Alibaba Cloud.

   Arm
   “Arm’s vision for the next-generation infrastructure requires complete
   edge-to-cloud security for protecting and managing the data across a
   trillion connected devices,” said Richard Grisenthwaite, senior vice
   president, chief architect and fellow, Architecture and Technology
   Group, Arm. “Arm is already very involved in helping to develop the
   Confidential Compute Consortium’s charter, and we see our participation
   and the new Open Enclave SDK as a critical collaboration with the rest
   of the industry in making TEE’s easy to deploy.”

   Baidu
   “The formation of Confidential Computing Consortium under Linux
   Foundation is an important step towards the future of technologies
   across cloud computing, blockchain and security. It will help to create
   the global technical standards of confidential computing and promote
   its business use at the enterprise level in different industries,” said
   Fei Song, head of product committee, AI Cloud, Baidu.

   Google
   “To help users make the best choice for how to protect their workloads,
   they need to be met with a common language and understanding around
   confidential computing. As the open source community introduces new
   projects like Asylo and OpenEnclave SDK, and hardware vendors introduce
   new CPU features that change how we think about protecting programs,
   operating systems, and virtual machines, groups like the Confidential
   Computing Consortium will help companies and users understand its
   benefits and apply these new security capabilities to their needs,”
   said Royal Hansen, vice president, Security, Google.

   IBM
   “IBM was one of the earliest companies to champion open source, and now
   aligned with Red Hat we are excited for the future. One of the emerging
   areas of interest to our IBM Cloud and Systems clients is Trusted
   Execution Environments (TEEs). Combined with new open software projects
   like Enarx and OpenEnclave SDK, they hold the promise of making future
   workloads as secure as possible in the next chapter of cloud. IBM has a
   history of leadership in secure computing, and we are proud to join the
   Confidential Computing Consortium to help it fulfill its promise of
   spanning multiple hardware architectures and cloud platforms, to
   protect tomorrow’s applications and data,” said Todd Moore, vice
   president, Open Technology and Developer Advocacy, IBM.

   Intel
   “Software developed through this consortium is critical to accelerating
   confidential computing practices built with open source technology and
   Intel SGX,” said Imad Sousou, corporate vice president and general
   manager, System Software Products at Intel. “Combining the Intel SGX
   SDK with Microsoft’s Open Enclave SDK will help simplify secure enclave
   development and drive deployment across operating environments.”

   Microsoft
   “The Open Enclave SDK is already a popular tool for developers working
   on Trusted Execution Environments, one of the most promising areas for
   protecting data in use,” said Mark Russinovich, chief technical
   officer, Microsoft. “We hope this contribution to the Consortium can
   put the tools in even more developers’ hands and accelerate the
   development and adoption of applications that will improve trust and
   security across cloud and edge computing.”

   Red Hat
   “Security is consistently top of mind for our customers, and, really,
   for all of us, as security incidents and data breaches make the
   headlines. While hardware support for security continues to advance,
   creating secure computing environments can still be challenging,” said
   Chris Wright, senior vice president and Chief Technology Officer at Red
   Hat. “We are developing the Enarx project to help developers deploy
   applications into computing environments which support higher levels of
   security and confidentiality and intend to bring it to the Confidential
   Computing Consortium. We look forward to collaborating with the broader
   industry and the Confidential Computing Consortium to help make
   confidential computing the norm.”

   Swisscom
   “As the leading telecom and ICT provider in Switzerland, we adhere to
   the highest security standards. Something that is particularly
   important given the increasing relevance of security for our customers
   in the wake of new technologies such as 5G and critical IoT or cloud
   applications. It is a privilege that we, as a Swiss company, are able
   to join forces with internationally leading technology companies to
   launch the Confidential Computing Consortium and are thus helping to
   define standards, frameworks and tools for securing data in the cloud,”
   said Christoph Aeschlimann, CTO & CIO, Swisscom.

   Tencent
   “Confidential computing offers CPU-based hardware technology to protect
   cloud users’ data in use, which we believe will become a basic
   capability for cloud provider in future,” said Wei Li, vice president
   of Tencent Security, the head of Cloud Security.

     throughout many communities. (But) there are things we couldn’t do
     before that we can now do, working in partnership with The Linux
     Foundation. If we were to take a project, open source it ourselves,
     and expect people to come to that project, that’s a very difficult
