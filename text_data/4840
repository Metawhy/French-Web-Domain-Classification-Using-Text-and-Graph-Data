A New Framework to Guide the Processing of RGBD Video

   CAEN on August 30, 2017

   Dr. Jason Corso and Dr. Brent Griffin are extending prior work in
   bottom-up video segmentation to include depth information from RGBD
   video, which allows us to better train for specific tasks and
   adaptively update representations of objects in complex environments.
   For robotics applications, we are incorporating this into a framework
   that guides the processing of RGBD video using a kinematic description
   of a robot’s actions, thereby increasing the quality of observations
   while reducing the overall computational costs.
   Using kinematically-guided RGBD video, we are able to provide feedback
   to a robot in real-time to: identify task failure, detect external
   objects or agents moving into a workspace, and develop a better
   understanding of objects while interacting them.
     * Category: robot perception & manipulation

Registering for Classes

How to Login to the System

   Go to Wolverine Access at wolverineaccess.umich.edu
    1. Under “Students” click on “Student Business”
    2. Log in with your uniqname and ITD (Kerberos) password
    3. Under “Student Center” click on “Backpack/Registration”

   Here are video tutorials on how to use the UMich course registration
   system.

   Add a Class:

   Before the Drop/Add Deadline
    1. Under “Find Classes,” select “Class Search” and then click on
       “Search”
    2. Enter the Subject Code and Catalog Number for the class you wish to
       add in the “Class Search Criteria” box and click “Search”
    3. You should now see “Search Results” displaying the first section of
       the course. By clicking on the blue arrow, you can scroll through
       all sections being offered
    4. Find the section number of the class for which you want to register
    5. Click on “Select Class”
    6. This should take you to the “Enrollment Preferences” screen
    7. Click on “Next”
    8. This should take you to the “Select Classes to Add” screen, and you
       should get a message telling you that the class has been added to
       your backpack
    9. Select the class, click on “Proceed to Step 2 of 3”, and follow the
       prompts to officially register for the class
   10. After registering, you should receive a message telling you that
       you are now registered for the class

   After the Add/Drop Deadline
    1. Follow the same steps as above.
    2. An email will be sent to the instructor and  ROB program
       coordinator for approval.
    3. You will receive a confirmation once the course is approved.

   Drop a Class:Before the Drop/Add Deadline
    1. Click on the “Drop” Tab
    2. If prompted, select the correct term
    3. Select class(es) you would like to drop
    4. Verify that you have selected the correct class(es)
    5. Click “Drop Selected Classes”
    6. Follow the prompts to finish dropping your classes
    7. You should receive a message telling you that you have successfully
       dropped.

   After the Add/Drop Deadline
   International Students: If you drop below full-time enrollment, you
   will need to get a reduced course load letter. Go to the International
   Student section of the program’s website for the instructions.
    1. Follow the same steps as above.
    2. An email will be sent to the instructor and ROB program coordinator
       for approval.
    3. You will receive a confirmation once the course is approved.

   Please note that when a course is dropped after the deadline, a “W”
   notation appears on the student’s transcript indicating that the
   student elected the course and later dropped it (even if the student
   never attended the class).

   Waitlist:

   If you cannot get into course, your best option is get on the waitlist
   and see if you are enrolled into the course when a student withdraws.
   Waitlists remain active on Wolverine Access until the drop/add deadline
   for that term. We do not know your chances of getting into the course.

   At the instructor’s discretion, course permissions can be issued to
   students. You can ask for permission to enroll in the course after the
   first day of class. We recommend that you do not contact the instructor
   for a course permission before the first day of class because you may
   not receive it.

   Course permission will come in an email. To use a course permission,
   students must first drop from the waitlist, and then add the class.

   Enroll in an Independent Study
    1. Under “Find Classes,” select “Class Search” and then click on
       “Search”
    2. Enter the Subject Code and Catalog Number for the independent
       course for the specific department. ROB 590.
    3. Click the box “Include Independent Study Classes”
    4. Click “Search”
    5. You should now see “Search Results” displaying the first section of
       the course.
    6. Select the Faculty member for the section which you want to
       register.
    7. Click on “Select Class”
    8. This should take you to the “Enrollment Preferences” screen

A New Framework to Guide the Processing of RGBD Video

   CAEN on August 30, 2017

   Dr. Jason Corso and Dr. Brent Griffin are extending prior work in
   bottom-up video segmentation to include depth information from RGBD
   video, which allows us to better train for specific tasks and
   adaptively update representations of objects in complex environments.
   For robotics applications, we are incorporating this into a framework
   that guides the processing of RGBD video using a kinematic description
   of a robot’s actions, thereby increasing the quality of observations
   while reducing the overall computational costs.
   Using kinematically-guided RGBD video, we are able to provide feedback
   to a robot in real-time to: identify task failure, detect external
   objects or agents moving into a workspace, and develop a better
   understanding of objects while interacting them.
     * Category: robot perception & manipulation
     * Tag: RGBD video

Registering for Classes

How to Login to the System

   Go to Wolverine Access at wolverineaccess.umich.edu
    1. Under “Students” click on “Student Business”
    2. Log in with your uniqname and ITD (Kerberos) password
    3. Under “Student Center” click on “Backpack/Registration”

   Here are video tutorials on how to use the UMich course registration
   system.

   Add a Class:

   Before the Drop/Add Deadline
    1. Under “Find Classes,” select “Class Search” and then click on
       “Search”
    2. Enter the Subject Code and Catalog Number for the class you wish to
       add in the “Class Search Criteria” box and click “Search”
    3. You should now see “Search Results” displaying the first section of
       the course. By clicking on the blue arrow, you can scroll through
       all sections being offered
    4. Find the section number of the class for which you want to register
    5. Click on “Select Class”
    6. This should take you to the “Enrollment Preferences” screen
    7. Click on “Next”
    8. This should take you to the “Select Classes to Add” screen, and you
       should get a message telling you that the class has been added to
       your backpack
    9. Select the class, click on “Proceed to Step 2 of 3”, and follow the
       prompts to officially register for the class
   10. After registering, you should receive a message telling you that
       you are now registered for the class

   After the Add/Drop Deadline
    1. Follow the same steps as above.
    2. An email will be sent to the instructor and  ROB program
       coordinator for approval.
    3. You will receive a confirmation once the course is approved.

   Drop a Class:Before the Drop/Add Deadline
    1. Click on the “Drop” Tab
    2. If prompted, select the correct term
    3. Select class(es) you would like to drop
    4. Verify that you have selected the correct class(es)
    5. Click “Drop Selected Classes”
    6. Follow the prompts to finish dropping your classes
    7. You should receive a message telling you that you have successfully
       dropped.

   After the Add/Drop Deadline
   International Students: If you drop below full-time enrollment, you
   will need to get a reduced course load letter. Go to the International
   Student section of the program’s website for the instructions.
    1. Follow the same steps as above.
    2. An email will be sent to the instructor and ROB program coordinator
       for approval.
    3. You will receive a confirmation once the course is approved.

   Please note that when a course is dropped after the deadline, a “W”
   notation appears on the student’s transcript indicating that the
   student elected the course and later dropped it (even if the student
   never attended the class).

   Waitlist:

   If you cannot get into course, your best option is get on the waitlist
   and see if you are enrolled into the course when a student withdraws.
   Waitlists remain active on Wolverine Access until the drop/add deadline
   for that term. We do not know your chances of getting into the course.

   At the instructor’s discretion, course permissions can be issued to
   students. You can ask for permission to enroll in the course after the
   first day of class. We recommend that you do not contact the instructor
   for a course permission before the first day of class because you may
   not receive it.

   Course permission will come in an email. To use a course permission,
   students must first drop from the waitlist, and then add the class.
