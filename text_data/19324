   Posted by Phill

   Hi Everone, as anyone who has visited this show will know its vast,
   over 18 huge halls covering everything from mannequins to carrier bags.
   I’ve selected some snaps of great ideas seen on our first day mostly
   covering visual merchandising features and mannequins.

   More to follow tomorrow.

Conran Store Spring 2017 – Michelin House London

   Feb 8

   Posted by Phill

   I love popping into The Conran shop when I’m in London, there is always
   so much inspiration to be found.

   This spring they have turned their windows into rooms by adding in a
   sub shopfront as you walk through the doors, it also acts as a backdrop
   to the windows. conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1390

   I have noticed a trend building over the last year for using Critall
   style metal window frames in many stores. But conran have also added
   simple blocks of colour to some of theirs, i saw  lots of stores using
   colour blocking whilst looking around London.

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1391

   Conran have continued the colour blocking theme inside their store,
   using it to great effect on walls, architectural features and fixtures.

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1392

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1393

   They are using it for way finding as well, helping to lead customers on
   their journey through the store.

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1394

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1398

   I love this trend/style wall they have created in their furniture area,
   it really stands out and offers customers great simple information.

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1395

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1396

   Love the clash of bright ribbons against this royal blue wall.

   conran-brompton-road-londonimg_1397

   Where they do not have a surface to paint they have been inventive and
   used plants to add the colour.

Striking Joseph windows Brompton London

   Jan 30

   Posted by Phill

   Saw these very striking windows in Joseph in the Brompton area in
   London, love the simple use of colour and the 3D globe made of acrylic
   sheets, the mannequin leaning on the window glass looks great too.

Great Crate Ideas

   Aug 11

   Posted by Phill

   Here at International Visual we love recycling and up cycling furniture
   and props to help make businesses look great. We find ourselves using
   crates on lots of occasions as they are so versatile, whether rustic &
   old, antique or vintage inspired new ones there are lots of great uses
   for them in the world of retail and display.

   Here are just a few examples of how versatile they are, from being used
   as risers on tables, creating wall shelving units to hanging them from
   ceilings to create great visual displays.

   See some great  examples of how versatile they are in the gallery
   below, from being used as risers on tables, creating wall shelving
   units to hanging them from ceilings to create great visual displays.

   Click on each photo for a larger view.

          Crates can make great wall fixture and help to make the product
          stand out as shown here.

          They work for lots of product types and fit spaces big and
          small.

          Here they have been used under a window with a few used on the
          window ledge as a feature.

          They make great risers on tables.

          and under tables.

          You can even make mid floor fixtures out of them, here we have
          stacked them on a simple wooden plinth as a drinks feature unit.

          They work really well for drinks, here you can see them wrapped
          around a floor column for wine and beer.

          In this store they were used in a tight corner to create a
          visual feature for wine and beer.

          In this store they were placed in a gap between two fridges for
          a red wine feature.

          They can be hung from ceilings, shown here above a food display
          with a blackboard attached to sign the product.

          Here they were used above a jam table, they were eventually
          planted with strawberry plants to add even more visual theatre.

          They are great for garden centres, used here on a table for a
          herb themed display.

          One of our clients used them as bedside tables in her glamping
          tents.

          They added their brand name to the top of the crates .

          Our crates are new but made to look vintage, they are stained in
          a light brown colour. We can make crates in lots of sizes, email
          us for a quote.

Visual Merchandising Expertise for Farm Food Stores

   Jul 1

   Posted by Phill

   Here at International Visual we spend our days making shops look good
   and getting them to perform better. We specialise in giving shops
   ‘make-overs’. Our input can make a visible difference in a very short
   timescale and often without the need for expensive shop fitting.

   IMG_2314

   We source and supply any props and kit required and then get to work on
   improving your shop. We get our sleeves rolled up and physically work
   with you and your team to make the most of your store.

   IMG_2308

   We have worked closely with several Farm Shops recently to create the
   right environment and promote their produce in the right way to get
   those extra sales. The photographs show the results and we take pride
   that we also get invited back because our ideas work!
   IMG_2338

   Add visual theatre to your perimeter walls that reinforce your key
   messages and provide information, customers will read these whilst
   waiting to be served.


   IMG_2199

   Add visual theatre to the exterior of your store by using visual props
   that make a statement and attract attention.
   IMG_1196

   Use visual propping and related products to enhance a key product story
   like we have done here with this egg story.











   See the gallery below for lots more inspirational photos of our work

          Use crates within fixture groups to add interest.

          Layer table groupings with visual props to add interest

          Crates are so versatile, they work really well for drinks

          And for lots of other product types

          Add in other visual features , here we have used a tree trunk to
          create a kiddies toy area

          You can use lots of props to crate a great display

          Small steps, baskets & trays work well

          This wine area has been brought to life using a ladder shelving
          unit and the huge graphic of a wine cellar

          Landscape your fixtures starting low at the front leading up to
          perimeter displays on your walls

          Old wardrobes painted can look amazing as wall perimeter
          fixtures

          Balance hard and soft products over your display , but make sure
          they are related by end use or theme

          This modern table has been given a new look by using ladders,
          trucks and trays


   If you need to improve your shop environment or know that your Visual
   Merchandising needs to be improved, get in touch with us.

Hands and Heads

   Posted by Phill

   Nice use of articulated hands in a boutique in Heathrow’s T5, notice
   how they have decorated one of the hands with the flower design from
   the front handbag.

Invisible thread chandelier

   May 20

   Posted by Phill

   Love this chandelier in Heathrow’s T5, it’s all hung from invisible
   wire, it must have taken ages to get the shape perfect.
