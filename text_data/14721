Spanish Scavenger Hunt

   [Spanish%2Bscavenger%2Bhunt.jpg]
   {Affiliate Links Used}
   I am currently setting up for my summer camps and was looking for some
   extra activities to do with my more advanced students that are reading.
   I found this set and decided to turn it into a scavenger hunt. It is
   used to teach young ones the alphabet, but I found that it was perfect
   to hide items (included in the set) for my students to find.
   In the set, there are 26 acorns (bellotas) and 26 little plastic items
   that can fit in the acorns. I set up the hunt to have the possibility
   of five teams (great for about 10-15 kids). If you have less than five
   teams that's ok. You can still set the game up and put all the acorns
   out even if they aren't going to all be picked up. It will add to the
   challenge. If you have around 20 kids then you will need two sets.
   I have created a file with the scavenger hunt lists already set up. You
   can find them here. (Scavenger hunt document) You will see two versions
   of the scavenger hunt with five groups each. The first number refers to
   which version. The second number refers to the group. At the end of the
   file, there is the word, "Socorro" printed several times. I will hand
   out one of these to each team in case they need help with a word. They
   can hand the SOCORRO paper to me at any time during the hunt to get a
   definition.
   Set up the acorns with the correct items according to the document.
   Hide them outdoors (or you could do this in a classroom if it's big
   enough). Give each team (groups of two or three students) one list of
   what they need to find and a SOCORRO paper. Tell them GO and see which
   team can find all their items first.
   Please note that there will be one extra acorn and item that won't be
   used. You can leave them out or you can tell your students that once
   they have collected their five items and have had them checked by the
   teacher that they then need to go find the last acorn (which I am going
   to leave empty-la bellota vacÃ­a).
   Also, instruct students that if they open an acorn and it's not the one
   they need then they will need to make sure they put the item back in
   the acorn and close it tightly before putting it back in its hiding
   space.  Otherwise, it will be mayhem!ðŸ˜±
   Here's the set you need: Acorn Scavenger Hunt Set
   And here's the file to set it up and play: Two Versions of the Hunt
   Have fun!

Las Banderas Volteadas (Flag Game)

   [Flipped%2BFlags%2BBanner.jpg]
   {Affiliate links used.}
   This summer I will be hosting a Spanish camp where we will focus a bit
   more on geography and the flags of the Spanish-speaking countries. I
   have been coming up with activities (games and crafts) to focus on the
   flags. (You can see more ideas here.)  I recently came across a game
   called Flipping Flags in which you flip over cards with three flags on
   them. Those playing keep turning over cards on the table until they see
   a match. As soon as they do, they call out the name of the country. It
   is fast-paced and looked fun. The only problem was that it contained
   all the flags from around the world. I only wanted to focus on the 21
   Spanish-speaking countries.
   [Flipped%2BFlags%2Bwith%2Bname.jpg]
   I had recently bought a thematic unit on Spanish-speaking countries
   from The Enlightened Elephant (You can see it here.). I printed out the
   flags at a reduced size. They needed to be small enough to fit three of
   them on one 4 inch by 3 inch card.  I printed out about 10 copies of
   each flag so that I could make a ton of cards. I then put three
   different flags on each card and then laminated them. You don't have to
   worry about which three to put on a card just make sure that they are
   different. I ended up with about 60 cards give or take which will allow
   me to split up the cards and have two games going with two different
   small groups (2-5 players would work).
   Here's how you play:
     * Give each player an equal amount of cards.
     * Players don't look at the cards. Instead, they place the stack face
       down in front of them.
     * One player announces "Volteemos" and everyone flips over a card
       from their stack.
     * If there is a match, then the first player to call out the country
       with matching flags gets those two cards.
     * If there is no match then leave the flipped cards on the table and
       keep playing by calling out "Volteemos" and flipping over cards
       until a match is seen. It can then be called out, but remember, the
       player can only pick up the two cards that he/she calls and that
       match. All the rest of the cards are left on the table.
     * You can set a timer and the player with the most cards at the end
       wins.

   This is a great way to get kids looking at the flags which in turn will
   help them recognize the flags later on.  Have fun!

Flag Relay Game

   [Flag%2Brelay%2Bgame%2Bbanner.jpg]
   {Affiliate links used.}
   This summer will be the third year I have done Spanish camps. I am so
   looking forward to it! My more advanced students will be working with a
   bit more geography and with the flags of Spanish-speaking countries. I
   was trying to come up with ideas on to get them more familiar with the
   flags. We will paint some of the flags on rocks (see the end of this
   post for more information). We will also be making the flags out of
   Legos (See Mundo de Pepita's post about this activity HERE.) But I also
   wanted a game we could do that would get them moving.
   So I decided to make a relay game out of the flags...
   [Flags%2B4.jpg]
   I picked out ten of the 21 flags. I limit my camps to ten kids at a
   time so with this game they can either work by themselves or in pairs.
   Basically, they will line up at the start line, and I will give each
   student or pair a country. Out in the field in front of them will be
   all the flag pieces. They will have to race to collect the correct
   pieces of their flag and put it together at the start line. Because my
   students are not going to know the flags at the beginning I will be
   providing them a paper with all the flags on them for reference.
   I started by cutting the appropriate color cardstock into pieces to
   make the ten flags I chose (see above). I then when and printed off any
   coats of arms or stars that were needed. All of the pieces are
   laminated for durability. While the game won't be completely fair (some
   flags will have a few more pieces than others), I think it will be a
   fun way to work with them.
   See below for a few more activities related to flags!
   [Flags%2B3.jpg]
   [Flags%2B1.JPG]
   Other ideas for flags?
   [Flag%2Brocks%2Bdone.jpg]
   Collect some rocks and get painting! We will be using acrylic paint
   (like this set) to paint several of the flags. You can seal the paint
   afterward with this sealer.
   [Chalk%2BFlag%2Bbanner.jpg]
   I bought a lot of sidewalk chalk (Here's a big pack of it.) in order
   for my students to draw flags. They really enjoyed this activity!
   Any other ideas for flags? I would love to hear them!

A Simple Weather Craft for Language Learners

   [Weather%2Bcraft.png]
   I have been teaching a six-session class called Â¡Explora EspaÃ±ol! this
   year. It combines language learning with simple crafts. Thus far, I had
   not found an easy idea to do with weather that I really like until I
   came across this photo.
   {Affiliate Links Used.}
   My goal is to first teach the vocabulary and then do the craft
   completely in the target language by giving step-by-step instructions.
   Here are the items you need:
     * Decorative Clear Gems that are round on the top and flat on the
       bottom for the rain. I bought mine at Michael's, but these ones are
       probably similar just a bit bigger.
     * These mini gold muffin liners for the sun.
     * Cotton balls
     * Gray Pipe Cleaners for the wind.
     * Mini foam snowflakes
     * Blue Cardstock
     * White Marker (if you are doing the project on darker paper). Since
       I work with small groups and young children, many times I will
       write out the words ahead of time on their papers. Obviously, older
       kids can do their own writing.

   Have fun creating and using the language!

Culture, Crafts, and Language Learning

   [Culture%2Band%2Bcrafts.jpg]
   {Affiliate Links Used}
   It's been SEVERAL months since I posted. Life has been much busier than
   I ever imagined. This past summer I did Spanish camps and loved
   teaching more kids the language and introducing them to the cultures
   where Spanish is spoken. At some point, I hope to do some posts on
   those adventures and share my teaching ideas.
   This fall I decided to offer a new type of class... Â¡Explora EspaÃ±ol!,
   a six-week class that gives kids a taste of Spanish through culture and
   crafts. I have really enjoyed this class more than I would have
   imagined. With each week, I teach a bit of Spanish and then connect it
   to a cultural component which leads into a craft. Let's take a look at
   one of the classes I did to see how it all works together...
   One week I taught the kids body parts. Since I tend to use Mr. Potato
   Head in my regular classes when teaching body parts I figured I would
   do the same in my exploratory class also. Then it hit me. Potatoes are
   originally from South America. There was a tie-in. So after teaching
   body parts, we talked about the potato and where it came from. I
   mentioned the many varieties out there...many more than my students had
   ever seen. We then reviewed the body parts using Mr. Potato Head. I
   then gave each student a potato and we got to work. This craft was done
   mostly in Spanish. We started with the "ojos" and did the complete
   face. The sombrero and zapatos were next. We finished by placing cut
   pipe cleaners on the sides for brazos.
   [Potato%2Bhead%2Bcraft%2B1.JPG]
   The paper parts I cut out ahead of time to save time. {Also, it is a
   good idea to wash and dry the potatoes ahead of time so the glue will
   stick.} You can find several templates online like here. Make sure to
   resize them so they will fit on the potatoes you are using.  We would
   review the name of the body part in Spanish and then students would put
   glue {We used this one, and it works well.} on the piece. Because the
   potatoes are round it helped to hold the pieces in place for a few
   seconds. I had the students count to twenty in Spanish before taking
   their fingers off one of the pieces. With the shoes, it was helpful to
   use these glue dots instead of the liquid glue. Aren't they so cute?
   Here are some other ideas for connecting language, culture, and crafts
   into your lessons {You can click on the link for each craft to get
   ideas}:
   Names of animals-- Talk about the importance of llamas in South
   America-- Paint a llama
   Clothing vocabulary-- Talk about Guatemala and worry dolls-- Make a
   worry doll
   [spanish%2Bcamp%2Bday%2B1%2Bworry%2Bdolls.jpg]
   House Vocabulary-- Talk about the neighborhood of La Boca, Buenos
   Aires, Argentina-- Make "La Boca Houses"
   Weather Vocabulary-- Talk about the Atacama Desert in Chile-- Make a
   Chilean rainstick
   Fruit and Veggie vocabulary-- Talk about Chile and Peru and
   arpilleras-- Make an arpillera
   Telling time-- Talk about the artist Salvador DalÃ­-- Make melting
   clocks
   Do you have any other connections for teaching language, culture and
   then adding a craft? I would love to hear them!!
