The International Fact-Checking Network

   The International Fact-Checking Network is a unit of the Poynter
   Institute dedicated to bringing together fact-checkers worldwide. The
   IFCN was launched in September 2015 to support a booming crop of
   fact-checking initiatives by promoting best practices and exchanges in
   this field.

   The International Fact-Checking Network:
     * Monitors trends, formats and policy-making about fact-checking
       worldwide, publishing regular articles in the section below and in
       a weekly newsletter.
     * Helps surface common positions among the world’s fact-checkers.
     * Promotes basic standards through the fact-checkers’ code of
       principles and projects to track the impact of fact-checking.
     * Funds annual fellowships, an innovation grant and a crowdfunding
       match program.
     * Convenes fact-checkers in a yearly conference (Global Fact) and
       promotes collaborative efforts in international fact-checking.
     * Provides training in person and online.
     * Advocates for more fact-checking, including through an annual
       International Fact-Checking Day.

   The IFCN team is currently formed by director Baybars Örsek, associate
   director Cristina Tardáguila and the intern Daniela Flamini. To find
   out more, read our transparency statement.
