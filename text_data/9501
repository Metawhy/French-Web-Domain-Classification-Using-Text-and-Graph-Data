   advertising campaigns across display, video, social and mobile
   channels, in real-time, using real-time bidding (“RTB”). Digilant also
   provides comprehensive reporting tools, including performance insights
   across multiple variables such as audience characteristics, ad format,

   addition, our platform allows for a unified view of consumers’
   interactions with transparent reporting, resulting in improved
   learnings.

In-Housing & Consulting

   Driven by concerns over transparency, brand safety, viewability and
   fraud, many of the world’s biggest brands are thinking about bringing
   their programmatic strategies in-house.

   By in-sourcing programmatic brands hope to attain increased control
   over how budgets are spent, a reduction in the proportion of ad spend
   eaten up by fees and tech providers, and better visibility into where
   ads are placed.

   But the cost and complexity of taking programmatic in-house means it’s
   not a viable solution for the majority of brands to undertake on their
   own.

   This is where Digilant can help.

   Flexible in our engagement model

   We understand and embrace the rise of insourcing media functions among
   leading brands. We offer fully managed services, consulting, and also
   work with many clients who are self-service customers. In these cases,
   we provide the training and ongoing support required to operate having
   an in-house capability exceptionally well. A typical engagement for us
   involves beginning the relationship on a managed service basis, and
   moving the client toward a self-service relationship over time.

OUR COMPANY

   Digilant is a programmatic buying company, designed for both agencies
   and brands. We connect people and technology to create a perfect blend
   of strategy, insight and efficiency that will elevate any marketing
   team to find massive success. We also support advertisers who are
   moving towards programmatic self-sufficiency by aligning with and
   training them on the right set of programmatic platforms and
   technologies.

   Using MAIA – Marketing, Artificial Intelligence and Analytics – the
   harmonious combination of machine power and human expertise behind all
   things DIGILANT, we intelligently navigate massive data sets. MAIA
   enables marketers to use data as a currency to generate more efficient
   media buys, make better informed decisions, optimize and drive
   performance across all digital channels and campaigns.

   Today Digilant continues to be an innovator in the programmatic space
   by translating the complicated signals coming from a sea of data.

   Digilant has had its hands in the programmatic space for many years,
   having designed and developed the first Trading Desk and the first Data
   Management Platform (DMP) in the industry.

   Digilant is an independent global company founded by the Rodés family
   through their family office of Inversiones y Servicios Publicitarios
   (ISP) and continues to be fully owned by them. Digilant is an
   ispDigital Group company.

SOLUTIONS FOR:

Agencies

   Digilant supports agencies by giving them the ability to deliver and
   win RFPs by providing programmatic strategy and set-up across all
   channels. Agencies who need quick-start support to get campaigns up and
   running or those with limited resources can count on us for all their
   programmatic and digital advertising needs.

   A dedicated Digilant account manager will be assigned to you from day
   one, who will be your single point of contact for support, training,
   and implementation, so that nothing falls through the cracks.

Brands

   Marketers at today’s brands are challenged with measuring, analyzing
   and predicting the behaviors of their consumers. Marketers have to be
   proficient in all the digital channels and are at the mercy of systems
   and software that are constantly evolving; thus leaving them exposed to
   overspending, fraud and overall concern for their brand safety.

   At Digilant we partner with industry leading platforms that are driving
   innovation for the ad-tech industry.  We use data as a currency, to not
   only build the most accurate audiences to target, but to give brands
   the ability to see the whole picture – how strategy, data, inventory
   and reporting all work together.

   A dedicated Digilant account manager is always available to make sure
   that marketers are successful with programmatic campaign implementation
   and to give brands thoughtful human insights on what matters most to
   them rather on just how to spend more budget.

   Digilant's leadership team has many decades of programmatic and digital
   advertising experience between them.
