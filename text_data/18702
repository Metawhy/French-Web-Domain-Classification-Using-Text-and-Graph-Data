   US plastic waste exports to developing countries in south-east Asia
   rose dramatically in the first six months of this year, as the
   international fallout from China’s decision to shut its doors to
   “foreign trash” continues.
   Unearthed can reveal that plastic waste exports from the US to
   Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam shot up from January to June 2018. But
   with these southeast Asian countries moving to impose import
   restrictions and plastic scrap piling up from California to Florida,
   the US recycling industry is talking about a mounting crisis in the
   country.

   China has historically been the world’s biggest importer of plastic
   waste, taking in 45% of cumulative imports since 1992, according to a
   study published this summer. The US sent around 70% of its plastic
   waste to China and Hong Kong last year. But Beijing’s move to stop
   importing low quality plastic scrap has forced recyclers in the west to
   take a long look at their business model. In the UK, figures from the
   recycling industry have said the sector is “lurching from crisis to
   crisis”.

   US plastic scrap exports dropped by almost a third in the first six
   months of 2018, as waste firms struggled to find a home for their
   plastic scrap. From 949,789 metric tonnes (2017) to 666,760 metric
   tonnes (2018).

   An analysis of trade data from the US Census Bureau found that other
   countries have accepted more plastic scrap.
     * In the first six months of 2017, a little over 4,000 metric tonnes
       of America’s plastic went to Thailand, but the country took in
       91,505 metric tonnes of America’s scrap in the same period this
       year. That’s an increase of 1,985%.
     * Malaysia experienced a similar increase, a rise of 273% to 157,299
       metric tonnes.
     * Vietnam also saw a significant rise, to 71,220 metric tonnes in the
       first six months of this year.
     * Exports to Turkey and South Korea also rose significantly in the
       same period, to 11,224 metric tonnes and 14,760 metric tonnes,
       respectively.
     * Despite the China ban, Asia remains the main destination for
       American waste exports. In the first six months of this year, 81%
       of plastic waste exports from the US went to Asia, a 7% drop on
       2017.

   Back where it came from
   The influx of western rubbish into these countries has forced some to
   impose restrictions on waste imports.

   Earlier this summer, plastic processing factories in Banting,
   south-west of Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpur were forced to close
   because of residents complaining of air and water pollution.

   The country’s government announced a new import tax on plastic waste,
   last week. Malaysia is also tightening requirements on operating
   permits and is looking to clampdown on illegal processors.

     In California, the environmental benefits of recycling now come with
     a cost

   Restrictions have also been introduced in Vietnam. In May, authorities
   in the country announced a temporary ban on plastic and paper waste
   imports from the middle of this June until October. Two of the
   country’s biggest ports – Tan Cang-Cai Mep International and Tan
   Cang-Cat Lai – have reportedly become overwhelmed with plastic and
   paper scrap since the China ban came into force.

   In Thailand, the influx of trash forced the government to introduce
   [story in Thai] inspections of all plastics and electronic waste
   imports into the country. The country’s authorities have also pledged
   to send waste back to where it came from if it’s imported without
   proper description.

   Experts are concerned that these increasingly popular destinations for
   US waste do not have the capacity to deal with waste in a safe or
   environmental way.

   “Some of these countries just don’t have the infrastructure in ports or
   roads to deal with an increase in volume of material,” Robin Wiener,
   CEO of US trade body the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries
   (ISRI), told Unearthed.

   “Pop-up recyclers are trying to take advantage of these shifting
   markets but they are not doing it properly. They are not following
   industry standards when it comes to environmental, health, and safety
   practices.”

   A global crisis

   All of this poses an unprecedented challenge for American recyclers.

   “We saw the writing on the wall,” Brent Bell, VP of recycling at Waste
   Management, the biggest waste management firm in the US, told
   Unearthed. “The industry has to find domestic outlets for our
   material.”

   Recycling firms, under pressure to meet higher standards, have seen
   costs rocket. While they have traditionally paid authorities for waste
   that could be turned into recycled goods, they are now starting to
   charge the state for the cost of getting rid of it.

   Stockpiling has been occurring in California, now the world’s fifth
   largest economy, and a number of bills are now being considered to cut
   plastic waste.

   Coastal cities have historically been more dependent on exporting waste
   to be recycled.

   San Diego is now facing a potential $1.1m annual charge from its waste
   contractor, which last year provided the city with a $4m income stream.

   “The environmental benefits of recycling now come with a cost that we
   haven’t seen in California before,” Zoe Heller, assistant director of
   policy development at CalRecycle, California’s state waste management
   agency, told Unearthed.

   “What used to be a very profitable revenue stream is now becoming a
   cost.”

   In towns and cities across the US, firms have been taking a variety of
   steps to deal with the backlog. Some have suspended their recycling
   schemes, begun education campaigns or refused to accept certain types
   of plastic waste. Others have refused to pick up rubbish from outside
   houses, sent recycling to landfill or burned it.

   Residents may have to pick up the bill; one town in Vermont is soon to
   start charging residents for their recycling. Alternatively costs could
   be passed on through higher taxes.

   In total, US plastic waste exports in the first six months of 2018 were
   worth $270m, a drop of almost $90m on the previous year.

   Bell, from Waste Management, is clear about what he thinks needs to
   happen: “We have to encourage manufacturers to use a high proportion of
   recycled content in their products. And we have to make sure recycling
   is clean to begin with.

   “There need to be more grants to help with upfront investments in
   manufacturing facilities so more companies can take recycled materials
   and make them into new products.”
