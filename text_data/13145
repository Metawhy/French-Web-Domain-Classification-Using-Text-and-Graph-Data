Final Protein Design by Provable Algorithms

   For billions of years, the process of evolution has optimized the
   sequence of amino acids that make up naturally occurring proteins to
   suit the needs of the organisms that make them. So we ask: Can we use
   computation to design non-naturally occurring proteins that suit our
   biomedical and industrial needs? This question is a combinatorial
   optimization problem, because the output of a protein design
   computation is a sequence of amino acids. "Protein Design by Provable
   Algorithms," a Review Article in the October 2019 issue of
   Communications of the ACM, focuses on protein design algorithms that
   perform this optimization using detailed modeling of the 3D structure
   of the protein. In this video, Mark A. Hallen and Bruce R. Donald
   discuss this groundbreaking work.

The DevOps Phenomenon

   ACM Queue’s “Research for Practice” consistently serves up
   expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates
   these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face
   every day. This installment of RfP is by Anna Wiedemann, Nicole
   Forsgren, Manuel Wiesche, Heiko Gewald, and Helmut Krcmar. Titled “The
   DevOps Phenomenon,” this RfP gives an overview of stories from across
   the industry about software organizations overcoming the early hurdles
   of adopting DevOps practices, and coming out on the other side with
   tighter integration between their software and operations teams, faster
   delivery times for new software features, and achieving a higher level
   of stability.

   Shaul Kfir cofounded Digital Asset in 2014 looking to prove something
   to the financial services industry, which he felt  was in danger of
   missing out on the potential of blockchain technology. In this ACM
   Queue Case Study, Kfir has a conversation with Camille Fournier, the
   head of platform development for a leading New York City hedge fund, in
   which the two financial service technology experts discuss how DAML
   (Digital Asset Modeling Language) puts blockchain technology to
   work, and what the future has in store for the blockchain and the
   challenge of distributed ledgers.

ACM Updates Code of Ethics

   ACM recently updated its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The
   revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances in computing
   technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing pervasiveness
   of computing in all aspects of society. To promote the Code throughout
   the computing community, ACM created a booklet, which includes the
   Code, case studies that illustrate how the Code can be applied to
   situations that arise in everyday practice and suggestions on how the
   Code can be used in educational settings and in companies and
   organizations. Download a PDF of the ACM Code booklet.

Final Protein Design by Provable Algorithms

   For billions of years, the process of evolution has optimized the
   sequence of amino acids that make up naturally occurring proteins to
   suit the needs of the organisms that make them. So we ask: Can we use
   computation to design non-naturally occurring proteins that suit our
   biomedical and industrial needs? This question is a combinatorial
   optimization problem, because the output of a protein design
   computation is a sequence of amino acids. "Protein Design by Provable
   Algorithms," a Review Article in the October 2019 issue of
   Communications of the ACM, focuses on protein design algorithms that
   perform this optimization using detailed modeling of the 3D structure
   of the protein. In this video, Mark A. Hallen and Bruce R. Donald
   discuss this groundbreaking work.

The DevOps Phenomenon

   ACM Queue’s “Research for Practice” consistently serves up
   expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates
   these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face
   every day. This installment of RfP is by Anna Wiedemann, Nicole
   Forsgren, Manuel Wiesche, Heiko Gewald, and Helmut Krcmar. Titled “The
   DevOps Phenomenon,” this RfP gives an overview of stories from across
   the industry about software organizations overcoming the early hurdles
   of adopting DevOps practices, and coming out on the other side with
   tighter integration between their software and operations teams, faster
   delivery times for new software features, and achieving a higher level
   of stability.

DAML: The Contract Language of Distributed Ledgers

   Shaul Kfir cofounded Digital Asset in 2014 looking to prove something
   to the financial services industry, which he felt  was in danger of
   missing out on the potential of blockchain technology. In this ACM
   Queue Case Study, Kfir has a conversation with Camille Fournier, the
   head of platform development for a leading New York City hedge fund, in
   which the two financial service technology experts discuss how DAML
   (Digital Asset Modeling Language) puts blockchain technology to
   work, and what the future has in store for the blockchain and the
   challenge of distributed ledgers.

ACM Updates Code of Ethics

   ACM recently updated its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The
   revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances in computing
   technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing pervasiveness
   of computing in all aspects of society. To promote the Code throughout
   the computing community, ACM created a booklet, which includes the
   Code, case studies that illustrate how the Code can be applied to
   situations that arise in everyday practice and suggestions on how the
   Code can be used in educational settings and in companies and
   organizations. Download a PDF of the ACM Code booklet.

India Region Special Section

   Communications of the ACM is pleased to introduce the India Region
   special section to Communications' readers. The Indian subcontinent has
   a population close to 1.8 billion, and is unique due to its diversity
   of people, cultures, spoken languages, and wide disparities in
   socioeconomic conditions. The region plays an important role in the
   global computing landscape with its highly trained manpower, software
   companies, and top universities that produce students that not only
   serve local needs, but move around the world and have global impact.
   CACM developed this special section to mirror all these facets. In this
   video, co-organizers Anand Deshpande, Pankaj Jalote, and PJ Narayanan
   discuss this section in the November issue.

   For Practitioners

The DevOps Phenomenon

   ACM Queue’s “Research for Practice” consistently serves up
   expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates
   these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face
   every day. This installment of RfP is by Anna Wiedemann, Nicole
   Forsgren, Manuel Wiesche, Heiko Gewald, and Helmut Krcmar. Titled “The
   DevOps Phenomenon,” this RfP gives an overview of stories from across
   the industry about software organizations overcoming the early hurdles
   of adopting DevOps practices, and coming out on the other side with
   tighter integration between their software and operations teams, faster
   delivery times for new software features, and achieving a higher level
   of stability.

DAML: The Contract Language of Distributed Ledgers

   Shaul Kfir cofounded Digital Asset in 2014 looking to prove something
   to the financial services industry, which he felt  was in danger of
   missing out on the potential of blockchain technology. In this ACM
   Queue Case Study, Kfir has a conversation with Camille Fournier, the
   head of platform development for a leading New York City hedge fund, in
   which the two financial service technology experts discuss how DAML
   (Digital Asset Modeling Language) puts blockchain technology to
   work, and what the future has in store for the blockchain and the
   challenge of distributed ledgers.

ACM Updates Code of Ethics

   ACM recently updated its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The
   revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances in computing
   technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing pervasiveness
   of computing in all aspects of society. To promote the Code throughout
   the computing community, ACM created a booklet, which includes the
   Code, case studies that illustrate how the Code can be applied to
   situations that arise in everyday practice and suggestions on how the
   Code can be used in educational settings and in companies and
   organizations. Download a PDF of the ACM Code booklet.
