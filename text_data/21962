School Friendly 5-Minute Honey Banana Sushi with Local Hive

   Can we talk about bringing birthday treats to our kid’s school for a
   minute?

   It’s a near artform to find the right balance in a school birthday
   treat won’t leave the kids bouncing off the wall while the teacher
   glances at your with narrowed eyes and will be ok for the peanut
   allergy / gluten sensitive pupils . . . but still also be fun enough to
   feel celebratory.

   I am on the opposite end of the spectrum of the crafty cooking mom who
   can pop into the kitchen and whip up a low/free everything banned at
   school cake. But, what I lack in baking skills I make up for in strides
   with creativity. That’s why I’m sharing with you one of my kids
   favorite recipes, invented especially for school birthday celebrations,
   5-Minute Honey Banana Sushi.

Are Louis Vuitton Bags With No Date Codes Real or Fake?

   September 12, 2019

   louis-vuitton-date-code-real-or-fake The Louis Vuitton date code is one
   of the most notable ways to identify an authentic Louis Vuitton. But
   without full authentication research, it’s actually one of the many
   ways that people make an inaccurate assumption about a bag.

   Just because a bag has what appears to be a date code does not mean the
   bag is automatically authentic. One of the easiest tricks for people
   who make replica bags is to put stamp some letters and numbers onto the
   bag and forge a date code. But what they don’t typically take the time
   and effort to do is evaluate the information that you defer from
   interpreting the code.

Seeds For Bees with Local Hive

   June 18, 2019

   seeds-for-bees-local-hive-pollinators-awareness A few weeks ago we went
   to a major league game and had the best time enjoying the game,
   festivities food and sunshine.  If you haven’t been to San Diego in
   June you need to at least once in your lifetime.  Even with our
   notorious “June gloom” the weather is still warm and Jacarandas trees
   are in full bloom it turns the city into a painted masterpiece.  The
   jacaranda tree fully flowers into a majestic purple bloom that is
   breathtaking.

   As we walked back to our seats after grabbing some of our favorite
   local fares for dinner we discovered the game was paused for bees on
   the field.  Right behind home plate was a massive beach ball sized
   swarm of bees.  A local company was called and to remove the bees and
   continue the game, they made the decision to exterminate them.  While
   many fans were surprised and wished there had been an alternative
   solution, but none more so than my sweet 6-year-old daughter.

   Welcome

   I am a quintessential California girl who found my way to San Diego by
   way of the Sonoma Wine Country. I have two precious children who have
   lit up my world like I could have never imagined, along with a loving
