   Raspberry Pi: Measure Humidity and Temperature with DHT11/DHT22

Raspberry Pi: Measure Humidity and Temperature with DHT11/DHT22

   With the Raspberry Pi and some sensors, it is easy to measure the
   temperature without much effort. In addition, however, the humidity in
   certain situations or projects (such as a weather station) can be
   enlightening. Sensors such as the DHT11 and DHT22 are not only
   available for a few euros, but they can also measure the temperature as
   well as the humidity.

Accessories

   As the sensors already carry (almost) everything, apart from a
   resistor, not many additional accessories are required. I have used
   this:
     * DHT11 or DHT22 humidity sensor
     * 10kΩ resistor
     * Breadboard and jumper wires

   You can see the difference between DHT11 and DHT22 here. As a result,
   the DHT11 (blue) is cheaper, but the DHT22 (white) is more precise and
   lasts longer. For applications in “extreme” areas (0-20% or 80-100%
   humidity), the DHT22 should be used, as it also supports these areas in
   contrast to the DHT11. For example, I have a DHT22 sensor in my fridge
   to measure and log temperature and humidity. In general, the 11er model
   should also be enough.


   [INS: :INS]

Setup of Raspberry Pi Humidity Sensor

   Raspberry Pi Humidity/Temperature Sensor Construction The left pin of
   the sensor is connected to 3V3 of Pi (pin1), the second sensor pin via
   a pull-up resistor (4.7k – 10kΩ) with a free GPIO of the raspberry
   (GPIO4, pin7) and the right senior pin comes at GND (Pin6) from the Pi.
   The second pin from the right of the sensor remains free.

   The structure is identical for DHT11 or DHT22 since the pins are
   assigned the same way.


Raspberry Pi Humidity Software Installation and Testing

   First of all, some packages have to be installed:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl git

   Now the library for the sensors can be loaded. I use a pre-built
   Adafruit library that supports a variety of sensors:
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git && cd Adafruit_Pyt
hon_DHT
sudo python setup.py install

   This creates a Python library that we can easily integrate into our
   projects.

   If everything went well, we can already read the temperature and
   humidity. The easiest way is to first use the demo files:
cd examples
sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 11 4

   The first parameter (11) indicates which sensor was used (22 for the
   DHT22) and the second, to which GPIO it is connected (not the pin
   number, but the GPIO number). This produces an output like the
   following:
$ sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 11 4
Temp=24.0*  Humidity=41.0%

   Attention: The sensors are only ready every two seconds. Be careful not
   to start a query every second.


   To integrate the Raspberry Pi humidity library into other (Python)
   projects, you only need the following:

   Python
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   6
   import Adafruit_DHT
   ...
   sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
   pin = 4
   humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, pin)
   ...


   [INS: :INS]

Log data permanently

   For weather stations and similar projects for monitoring the
   temperature and humidity, it is useful to store these values at regular
   time intervals so that they can be analyzed later. One possibility
   would be to save in local database, but this has the disadvantage that
   under certain circumstances, the SD card could be charged too much.

   Therefore, I have chosen a different method that stores the data on an
   external server. This service is free for normal use and it is very
   easy to save data, as shown here:

       I get to the line git clone
       https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git & sudo python
       setup.py install and I get the following python: can’t open file
       ‘setup.py’: [Error 2] No such file or directory

       What should I check next or should I erase and start over and if
       start over do I have to delete?

       Found the answer. The line in the tutorial
       “https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git & sudo python
       setup.py install” . After it ran and I got the errors. I changed
       Directory cd Adafruit_Python_DHT the sudo python setup.py install.
       Then sudo ./Adafruit.py 11 4 and it worked!

       Cyril, ‘git clone
       https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git‘ creates
       Adafruit_Python_DHT dir and clones there. So, you have to change
       dir to that one with the ‘cd’ command.

       I set DHT11 with my Raspberry.
       Normally seems it shows correct results eg. 22*/46%, but after 10
       lines goes mad eg. 7*/105%. Than again turns to normal. Is it about
       a bad sensor?

            The manufacturers do not recommended that you read data from
            the sensor more than once per 2 seconds. If you do you may get
            incorrect readings.

       else i should order, do i need A/D converter and which one , also
       in order to send data do i need other components to carry out with
       my work, like what are the components required with the pi

            I am certainly no expert but have had similar problems in the
            past. It looks like it might be a problem with the DHT
            library, try removing and installing it again. There also
            might be a problem with where the files were installed. If
            they are too deep in the structure it won’t work.

            Have you tried multiple sensors? Also, for the 2302, I just
            use 22. I had one bad sensor. Drove me nuts till I just
            plugged in the other sensor. Of note, if you buy the sensors
            already mounted on a small PC board with only 3 lines coming
            out, skip the breadboard with the resistor. It’s already on
            the PC board. Just hook up 3.3, Gnd, and GPIO4.

       Hi
       Someone asked already but I hope for a reply too:
       1. how do I connect multiple DHT11 or DHT22 sensors?
       2. What’s the limit how many can I add to the series?
       3. What’s the Max distance between Raspberry and the sensor for a
       simple wire without any extra electronic components ?
       4. How to deal with distances longer than a max for simple wires,
       like what kind of circuits would extend the range or digitize it?
       Thank you!

   Funkkommunikation zwischen Raspberry Pi's mittels MQTT Broker/Client

   Wireless communication between Raspberry Pi’s via MQTT broker/client

   MQTT is a protocol that specifically sends data from devices of the
   Internet of Things and is supported by most microcontrollers and
   systems. To use Raspberry Pi MQTT communication, not much is needed,
   which is why this type of transmission is very interesting. In
   addition, it is really easy to use. In this tutorial, we … Continue

   Raspberry Pi: Measure Humidity and Temperature with DHT11/DHT22

   Raspberry Pi: Measure Humidity and Temperature with DHT11/DHT22

   With the Raspberry Pi and some sensors, it is easy to measure the
   temperature without much effort. In addition, however, the humidity in
   certain situations or projects (such as a weather station) can be
   enlightening. Sensors such as the DHT11 and DHT22 are not only
   available for a few euros, but they can also measure … Continue reading
