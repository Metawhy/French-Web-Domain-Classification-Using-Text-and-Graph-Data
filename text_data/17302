   We’re raising our prices soon.

   Since our launch five years ago, prices of cotton and other key
   commodities have significantly increased. Paying our suppliers fairly
   and providing you with the best products on the market is paramount to
   us—to that end, prices of some of our Classic and Luxe sheets will rise
   up to 15% starting March 26th, 2019.
