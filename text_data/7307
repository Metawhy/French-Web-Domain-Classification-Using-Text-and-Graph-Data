Privacy Policy

Florence Privacy Policy

Last Updated 08/22/19

   Welcome! This website florencebymills.com (the “Site”) is owned and
   operated by Florence Beauty, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
   headquartered in Los Angeles, California ("Florence", "we", "our" or
   "us"). This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices and applies
   to your use of this Site, including interactive features, platforms,
   marketplace, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads of the
   Site and other online services that we own and control and that post a
   link to this Privacy Policy, regardless of how you access or use the
   Site, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise
   (collectively with the Site,  the “Service”).

   However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to data we receive from
   third parties, unless we combine such data with Personal Data (defined
   below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy. This
   Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline
   or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below),
   and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may
   interact with our Service.

   To the extent we provide you notice on our Service of different or
   additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our
   collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection
   and use.  In addition, please review the Service’s Terms and Conditions
   of Service, which governs your use of the Service.

   If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), it is
   important you read this Privacy Policy, in particular to Section 8.

   By using our Service, you agree to the Terms and Conditions of Service
   and consent to our Privacy Policy, including the collection, use,
   sharing and disclosure of your information and data, and other
   activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to
   the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Service.

1. Information We Collect

   We may collect and store information about you in connection with your
   use of the Service, including any information you transmit to
   or through the Service.  Such information may be collected in three
   ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by
   creating an account, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect
   information automatically, such as through tracking tools like browser
   Cookies, and/or (3) from third parties, such as ad networks or social
   networks, may provide information to us.  Each of these methods is
   described in more detail below.

a. Information You Choose to Provide

   We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information,
   such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information
   that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, phone
   number, gender, birth date, credit card, mailing address, username and
   password, location and email address (“Personal Data”).

   The following are some examples in which you may choose to provide
   Personal Data to us:
     * When you choose to register for an account to use the Service;
     * When you purchase something from us or otherwise engage in a
       transaction with us;
     * When you contact us for any reason (e.g.  through “contact us”
       forms), including for technical support or customer service; or
     * When you choose to subscribe to our emails or to receive other
       information from us.

b. Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Service

   In addition to any information that you submit to us through the
   Service, we and our third-party service providers may collect or store
   certain information automatically (or passively) whenever you visit or
   otherwise interact with the Service (“Usage Information”). We may use
   various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information
   (“Tracking Technologies”), which may be downloaded to your personal
   computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (each a
   “Device”). We typically aggregate the data that we collect
   automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among
   groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals. To the
   extent we associate Usage Information with Personal Data that we
   collect directly from you through the Service, or if the information
   collected automatically identifies you  individually, we will treat it
   as Personal Data.

   The following are examples of Usage Information we may collect:
     * Your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“Device
       Identifier”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is
       automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service,
       and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
     * Other Cookies also collect information on your behavior by
       collecting referring URLS (where our visitors come from, which
       banners they clicked on and which directed them to our Service),
       pages accessed, times of visits.
     * Your Device location.

c. Information Third Parties Provide About You

   We may supplement the information we collect directly from you on our
   Service with outside records from third parties (e.g., delivered by
   advertising agencies, analytics providers, etc.)  for various purposes,
   including so that we can deliver the products you have requested, to
   enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to
   offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.

   We collect this information:
     * when you use a third-party service like Google, or log into the
       Service via a social media account such as Facebook.  For example,
       social networks may provide us with certain information about you
       from your profile on their website such as contact information,
       demographics, and other information you provided to that website
       such as your photo, user name, and potentially any and all
       information that you agreed the social network or other party could
       provide to us.
     * when you request information from or provide information to third
       parties.  For example, you may be presented with an option on our
       Service to receive certain information and/or marketing offers
       directly from third parties or to have us send certain information
       to third parties or give them access to it.

   Please note, third parties may retain any information used or provided
   in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’
   practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  For example, if you
   post content to a third-party service through the Service, that third
   party service will also receive that content, which will be visible to
   anyone that has access to it through that third-party service. Further,
   when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their
   services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for
   their practices or use of their use of your information. You should
   review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such
   third-party tools on our Service.

2. Tracking Technologies and Use of Cookies

   We may use various methods and technologies to collect and store
   information automatically (“Cookies”) when you use or interact with the
   Service. This information may be stored or accessed using Cookies that
   may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet,
   mobile phone or other device (each, a “Device”).

   A few of the Cookies include, without limitation, the following (and
   subsequent technology and methods later developed):  Cookies,
   advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s
   IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID), web beacons, tags, embedded scripts,
   local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called "flash
   cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such
   as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID), Browser Fingerprinting,
   E-Tags and similar technology in connection with your use of the
   Service, third party websites and mobile applications. For more
   information about some of these Cookies click here.

    The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:

   Purpose

   we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for an
   account.

   list.

   Notifications

   Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we

   more personalized content on the Service.

   Sharing Content

   We may include in the Service the possibility to share content with

   Such is the case for instance of “Like” and “Share” functionalities
   offered by social network platforms (“Facebook”, “Twitter”, etc.)

   Analytics

   Intended to help us understand how users use the Service. For example,
   we use Cookies for web analytics to measure the web sites activity and

   improving visibility of our content.

   or clicked on, advertisements.

   Further, we may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along
