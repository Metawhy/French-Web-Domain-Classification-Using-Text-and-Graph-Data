What is Encaustic Painting?

     Encaustic is a waxed-based medium, that consists of beeswax and
     damar resin, a natural tree sap that acts as a hardening agent. The
     encaustic painting process involves heat at every stage of the
     process to apply and fuse the medium. The name Encaustic comes from
     the greek enkaustikos which means to burn in.

   Here you’ll learn about encaustic painting techniques & tools. Whether
   you’re a beginner learning to paint with encaustic or an experienced
   artist, I invite you to add your comments to share your knowledge and
   inspiration about art and All Things Encaustic.

   use a standard height throughout the exhibition. The rule of thumb is
   to hang art at eye-level, with the centre of the ...

How to reuse encaustic scrapings

   Scraping is part of the encaustic painting process but this can feel

   Testing suitable encaustic grounds using the freezer test

Testing Suitable Encaustic Grounds using the Freezer Test

   When I want to know things I tend to go to the bottom and gather
   knowledge and experience from different sources. Then I try out the
   facts/statements in my own practice. For me it’s important to not just
   know how things work, but also why. So now I have painted with
   encaustic for some time and feel I have pretty much a good picture of
   the basics. In most areas, except one. A discussed topic with a lot of
   different opinions. I guess tradition is interfering with new
   approaches. Good old facts are challenged by new science ...

   My Art-day Vow with Christina Lovisa

Give yourself permission to play

   When students come to an encaustic workshop with a pre-planned project
   and high expectations that they will be taking home a fabulous and
   finished work of art, they often don't give themselves permission to
   play and embrace the process of art-making. Commit to the process,
   detach from the outcome!! To help students commit to the process and
   detach from the outcome, I begin my workshops having students recite
   the Art-day vow. My Art-day vow Put your hand on your heart and repeat
   after me... I vow to welcome this day with open arms. I promise to let

   Selecting Japanese paper for Encaustic Monoprinting by Nancy Jacobi of
   the Japanese Paper Place

Selecting Japanese paper for Encaustic Monoprinting

   Washi is the Japanese word for the traditional papers made from the
   long inner fibres of three plants, wa meaning Japanese and shi meaning
   paper. The term “rice paper” is really a misnomer, the paper has
   nothing to do with rice. The range of Japanese papers that The Japanese
   Paper Place ships around the world is vast. With so many Japanese
   papers to choose from, how do you to decide what’s best for encaustic
