   The water cycle is often taught as a simple circular cycle of
   evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Although this can be a
   useful model, the reality is much more complicated. The paths and
   influences of water through Earth’s ecosystems are extremely complex
   and not completely understood. NOAA is striving to expand understanding
   of the water cycle at global to local scales to improve our ability to
   forecast weather, climate, water resources, and ecosystem health.

   graphic shows where evaporation, condensation, and precipitation may
   take place and also shows transportation, sublimation, deposition,
   runoff, infiltration, percolation, groundwater, plant uptake, and
   transpiration.

   Water is essential to life on Earth. In its three phases (solid,
   liquid, and gas), water ties together the major parts of the Earth’s
   climate system — air, clouds, the ocean, lakes, vegetation, snowpack,
   and glaciersoffsite link.

   The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth
   and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different
   processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form
   clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow.
   Water in different phases moves through the atmosphere
   (transportation). Liquid water flows across land (runoff), into the
   ground (infiltration and percolation), and through the ground
   (groundwater). Groundwater moves into plants (plant uptake) and
   evaporates from plants into the atmosphere (transpiration). Solid ice
   and snow can turn directly into gas (sublimation). The opposite can
   also take place when water vapor becomes solid (deposition).

   Water influences the intensity of climate variability and change. It is
   the key part of extreme events such as drought and floods. Its
   abundance and timely delivery are critical for meeting the needs of
   society and ecosystems.

   Humans use water for drinking, industrial applications, irrigating
   agriculture, hydropower, waste disposal, and recreation. It is
   important that water sources are protected both for human uses and
   ecosystem health. In many areas, water supplies are being depleted
   because of population growth, pollution, and development. These
   stresses have been made worse by climate variations and changes that
   affect the hydrologic cycle.

U.S. coral reefs facing warming waters, increased bleaching

   Hotter-than-normal ocean temperatures continue for 3rd consecutive year
   Oceans & Coasts

   June 20, 2016 A new NOAA outlook shows that many coral reefs across
   around the world will likely be exposed to higher-than-normal sea
   temperatures for an unprecedented third year in a row, leading to
   increased bleaching – and with no signs of stopping.

   While the bleaching event is global, it will hit the U.S. hard,
   especially in Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
   Islands, Florida Keys, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The deeper
   reefs in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, 100 miles
   off the coast of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico, are also in the
   crosshairs.

   NOAA Coral Reef Watch finds there is a 90 percent chance of widespread
   coral bleaching in the Pacific island nations of Palau and the
   Federated States of Micronesia during the probable La Nina. La Nina
   conditions can cause high ocean temperatures in the western Pacific.
   NOAA is currently predicting a 75 percent chance of La Nina development
   this year.

   "It’s time to shift this conversation to what can be done to conserve
   these amazing organisms in the face of this unprecedented global
   bleaching event,” said Jennifer Koss, NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation
   Program director. “We have boots on the ground and fins in the water to
   reduce local stressors. Local conservation buys us time, but it isn’t
   enough. Globally, we need to better understand what actions we all can
   take to combat the effects of climate change."

   NOAA is actively working with coastal resource managers and communities
   in coral reef areas to provide the best available science and tools to
   enhance reef resilience. The agency and its partners are also
   developing methods to assess the potential resilience of reefs so
   management officials can target and prioritize local conservation
   actions.

   This third global coral bleaching event began in mid-2014 is ongoing.
   Global warming, coupled with an intense El Nino, continues to make this
   the longest and most widespread coral bleaching event on record. Since
   its onset, all U.S. coral reefs have seen above normal temperatures and
   more than 70 percent of them have been exposed to the prolonged high
   temperatures that can cause bleaching. Studies have shown that about 93
   percent of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was bleached as of this
   April.

   “NOAA’s satellite and climate models provide us with the ability to
   track the high temperatures that are causing this bleaching and alert
   resource managers and scientists around the world,” said C. Mark Eakin,
   NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch coordinator. “However, it is crucial that
   scientists and the public continue on site monitoring of reefs to track
   the actual extent and severity of the bleaching.”

   A bleaching event is not always a death sentence for corals. In fact,
   corals are remarkably resilient creatures. Just as a healthy person is
   more able to fend off a cold, healthy corals are more likely to resist
   large-scale stress like a bleaching event. Resilient corals that do
   bleach have a better chance of recovering if ocean temperatures return
   to normal relatively quickly and other human impacts are kept at a
   minimum.

   This week, the global bleaching event is on the minds of the world’s
   top coral reef experts as they gather for the 13th International Coral
   Reef Symposium in Honolulu where the focus is bridging science to
   policy to achieve coral reef sustainability. Panels and presentations
   about NOAA’s extensive coral reef portfolio will take place throughout
   the week.

   NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Program was established in 2000 by the
   Coral Reef Conservation Act to protect, conserve, and restore the
   nation’s coral reefs by maintaining healthy ecosystem function.

   NOAA’s mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's
   environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun,
   and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources. Join us on
   Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and our other social media channels.

El Nino

   The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important
   climatic phenomena on Earth.

   By influencing global temperatures and precipitation, ENSO
   significantly impacts Earth’s ecosystems and human societies. El Nino
   and La Nina are opposite extremes of the ENSO, which refers to cyclical
   environmental conditions that occur across the Equatorial Pacific
   Ocean. These changes are due to natural interactions between the ocean
   and atmosphere. Sea surface temperature, rainfall, air pressure,
   atmospheric and ocean circulation all influence each other.

   2015. A strong El Niño continued during December 2015 with well above
   average sea surface temperatures across the central and eastern
   equatorial Pacific Ocean.

   El Nino and La Nina are opposite extremes of the El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), which refers to cyclical environmental conditions
   that occur across the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. These changes are due
   to natural interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Sea surface
   temperature, rainfall, air pressure, and atmospheric and ocean
   circulation all influence each other.

   Nino's of the 20th century and the 1918 flu pandemic.

   An El Nino condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial
   Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than
   normal. The opposite condition is called La Nina. During this phase of
   ENSO, the water is cooler than normal and the east winds are stronger.
   El Ninos typically occur every 3 to 5 years.

   El Nino, La Nina, and the neutral condition all produce important
   consequences for people and ecosystems across the globe. The
   interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the
   world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, droughtoffsite
   link or flooding. Beyond “just” influencing the weather, these changes
   can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices,
   forest fires, and create additional economic and political
   consequences. Famines and political strife can result from these
   environmental conditions.

   Ecosystems and human communities can be positively or negatively
   affected. For example, in the Southern United States, during the fall
   through spring, El Nino usually causes increased rainfall and sometimes
   destructive flooding. La Nina, however, usually causes drier weather in
   the South, but the Northwest tends to be colder and wetter than
   average. Even though El Nino occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it often
   reduces the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean.
   Conversely, La Nina events tend to be related to an increase in the
   number of Atlantic hurricanes.

   Food production is impacted by ENSO. Changes in ocean temperatures and
   currents that happen during El Nino impact marine life. This can impact
   individuals who make a living fishing and consumers who depend on
   certain fish for food. Agriculture is of course very dependent on
   climate and weather, as a result ENSO’s influence on rainfall and
   temperature have important consequences for food production and
   availability.

The origin of the name

   The origin of the name “El Niño” dates to the 1800’s, when fishermen on
   the Pacific coast of South America would notice that a warm ocean
   current would appear every few years. Fish catches would drop
   drastically, negatively affecting the food supply and livelihood of the
   communities of coastal Peru. This warm water would arrive around
   Christmastime. Referring to the birth of Christ, they named the warm
   ocean waters, El Nino, which means “the boy” in Spanish. Fishing in
   this region is best during La Nina years when cold upwelling ocean
   water brings rich nutrientsoffsite link from the deep ocean, resulting
   in an increase in the number of fish caught.

EDUCATION CONNECTION

   ENSO provides teachers with the opportunity to have students discover
   ways that the oceanic and atmospheric systems interact and how those
   interactions can impact ecosystems and human society. The resources in
   this collection can be used to help learn about the basics of ENSO, the
   inter-relationship of Earth systems, the consequences of these
   interactions, and how to use and analyze data. These resources can be
   used to teach students how scientists study the complexity of the
   Earth’s systems and why better El Nino/La Nina forecasts can benefit
   agriculture, natural resource managers and human communities.

   The water cycle is often taught as a simple circular cycle of
   evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Although this can be a
   useful model, the reality is much more complicated. The paths and
   influences of water through Earth’s ecosystems are extremely complex
   and not completely understood. NOAA is striving to expand understanding
   of the water cycle at global to local scales to improve our ability to
   forecast weather, climate, water resources, and ecosystem health.

   graphic shows where evaporation, condensation, and precipitation may
   take place and also shows transportation, sublimation, deposition,
   runoff, infiltration, percolation, groundwater, plant uptake, and
   transpiration.

   Water is essential to life on Earth. In its three phases (solid,
   liquid, and gas), water ties together the major parts of the Earth’s
   climate system — air, clouds, the ocean, lakes, vegetation, snowpack,
   and glaciersoffsite link.

   The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth
   and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different
   processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form
   clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow.
   Water in different phases moves through the atmosphere
   (transportation). Liquid water flows across land (runoff), into the
   ground (infiltration and percolation), and through the ground
   (groundwater). Groundwater moves into plants (plant uptake) and
   evaporates from plants into the atmosphere (transpiration). Solid ice
   and snow can turn directly into gas (sublimation). The opposite can
   also take place when water vapor becomes solid (deposition).

   Water influences the intensity of climate variability and change. It is
   the key part of extreme events such as drought and floods. Its
   abundance and timely delivery are critical for meeting the needs of
   society and ecosystems.

   Humans use water for drinking, industrial applications, irrigating
   agriculture, hydropower, waste disposal, and recreation. It is
   important that water sources are protected both for human uses and
   ecosystem health. In many areas, water supplies are being depleted
   because of population growth, pollution, and development. These
   stresses have been made worse by climate variations and changes that
   affect the hydrologic cycle.

   Climate change is affecting where, when, and how much water is
   available. Extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy
   precipitation, which are expected to increase as climate changes, can
   impact water resources. A lack of adequate water supplies, flooding, or
   degraded water quality impacts civilization — now and throughout
   history. These challenges can affect the economy, energy production and
   use, human health, transportation, agriculture, national security,
   natural ecosystems, and recreation.

U.S. coral reefs facing warming waters, increased bleaching

   Hotter-than-normal ocean temperatures continue for 3rd consecutive year
   Oceans & Coasts

   June 20, 2016 A new NOAA outlook shows that many coral reefs across
   around the world will likely be exposed to higher-than-normal sea
   temperatures for an unprecedented third year in a row, leading to
   increased bleaching – and with no signs of stopping.

   While the bleaching event is global, it will hit the U.S. hard,
   especially in Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
   Islands, Florida Keys, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The deeper
   reefs in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, 100 miles
   off the coast of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico, are also in the
   crosshairs.

   NOAA Coral Reef Watch finds there is a 90 percent chance of widespread
   coral bleaching in the Pacific island nations of Palau and the
   Federated States of Micronesia during the probable La Nina. La Nina
   conditions can cause high ocean temperatures in the western Pacific.
   NOAA is currently predicting a 75 percent chance of La Nina development
   this year.

   "It’s time to shift this conversation to what can be done to conserve
   these amazing organisms in the face of this unprecedented global
   bleaching event,” said Jennifer Koss, NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation
   Program director. “We have boots on the ground and fins in the water to
   reduce local stressors. Local conservation buys us time, but it isn’t
   enough. Globally, we need to better understand what actions we all can
   take to combat the effects of climate change."

   NOAA is actively working with coastal resource managers and communities
   in coral reef areas to provide the best available science and tools to
   enhance reef resilience. The agency and its partners are also
   developing methods to assess the potential resilience of reefs so
   management officials can target and prioritize local conservation
   actions.

   This third global coral bleaching event began in mid-2014 is ongoing.
   Global warming, coupled with an intense El Nino, continues to make this
   the longest and most widespread coral bleaching event on record. Since
   its onset, all U.S. coral reefs have seen above normal temperatures and
   more than 70 percent of them have been exposed to the prolonged high
   temperatures that can cause bleaching. Studies have shown that about 93
   percent of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was bleached as of this
   April.

   “NOAA’s satellite and climate models provide us with the ability to
   track the high temperatures that are causing this bleaching and alert
   resource managers and scientists around the world,” said C. Mark Eakin,
   NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch coordinator. “However, it is crucial that
   scientists and the public continue on site monitoring of reefs to track
   the actual extent and severity of the bleaching.”

   A bleaching event is not always a death sentence for corals. In fact,
   corals are remarkably resilient creatures. Just as a healthy person is
   more able to fend off a cold, healthy corals are more likely to resist
   large-scale stress like a bleaching event. Resilient corals that do
   bleach have a better chance of recovering if ocean temperatures return
   to normal relatively quickly and other human impacts are kept at a
   minimum.

   This week, the global bleaching event is on the minds of the world’s
   top coral reef experts as they gather for the 13th International Coral
   Reef Symposium in Honolulu where the focus is bridging science to
   policy to achieve coral reef sustainability. Panels and presentations
   about NOAA’s extensive coral reef portfolio will take place throughout
   the week.

   NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Program was established in 2000 by the
   Coral Reef Conservation Act to protect, conserve, and restore the
   nation’s coral reefs by maintaining healthy ecosystem function.

   NOAA’s mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's
   environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun,
   and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources. Join us on
   Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and our other social media channels.

El Nino

   The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important
   climatic phenomena on Earth.

   By influencing global temperatures and precipitation, ENSO
   significantly impacts Earth’s ecosystems and human societies. El Nino
   and La Nina are opposite extremes of the ENSO, which refers to cyclical
   environmental conditions that occur across the Equatorial Pacific
   Ocean. These changes are due to natural interactions between the ocean
   and atmosphere. Sea surface temperature, rainfall, air pressure,
   atmospheric and ocean circulation all influence each other.

   2015. A strong El Niño continued during December 2015 with well above
   average sea surface temperatures across the central and eastern
   equatorial Pacific Ocean.

   El Nino and La Nina are opposite extremes of the El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), which refers to cyclical environmental conditions
   that occur across the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. These changes are due
   to natural interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Sea surface
   temperature, rainfall, air pressure, and atmospheric and ocean
   circulation all influence each other.

   Nino's of the 20th century and the 1918 flu pandemic.

   An El Nino condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial
   Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than
   normal. The opposite condition is called La Nina. During this phase of
   ENSO, the water is cooler than normal and the east winds are stronger.
   El Ninos typically occur every 3 to 5 years.

   El Nino, La Nina, and the neutral condition all produce important
   consequences for people and ecosystems across the globe. The
   interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the
   world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, droughtoffsite
   link or flooding. Beyond “just” influencing the weather, these changes
   can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices,
   forest fires, and create additional economic and political
   consequences. Famines and political strife can result from these
   environmental conditions.

   Ecosystems and human communities can be positively or negatively
   affected. For example, in the Southern United States, during the fall
   through spring, El Nino usually causes increased rainfall and sometimes
   destructive flooding. La Nina, however, usually causes drier weather in
   the South, but the Northwest tends to be colder and wetter than
   average. Even though El Nino occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it often
   reduces the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean.
   Conversely, La Nina events tend to be related to an increase in the
   number of Atlantic hurricanes.

   Food production is impacted by ENSO. Changes in ocean temperatures and
   currents that happen during El Nino impact marine life. This can impact
   individuals who make a living fishing and consumers who depend on
   certain fish for food. Agriculture is of course very dependent on
   climate and weather, as a result ENSO’s influence on rainfall and
   temperature have important consequences for food production and
   availability.

The origin of the name

   The origin of the name “El Niño” dates to the 1800’s, when fishermen on
   the Pacific coast of South America would notice that a warm ocean
   current would appear every few years. Fish catches would drop
   drastically, negatively affecting the food supply and livelihood of the
   communities of coastal Peru. This warm water would arrive around
   Christmastime. Referring to the birth of Christ, they named the warm
   ocean waters, El Nino, which means “the boy” in Spanish. Fishing in
   this region is best during La Nina years when cold upwelling ocean
   water brings rich nutrientsoffsite link from the deep ocean, resulting
   in an increase in the number of fish caught.

EDUCATION CONNECTION

   ENSO provides teachers with the opportunity to have students discover
   ways that the oceanic and atmospheric systems interact and how those
   interactions can impact ecosystems and human society. The resources in
   this collection can be used to help learn about the basics of ENSO, the
   inter-relationship of Earth systems, the consequences of these
   interactions, and how to use and analyze data. These resources can be
   used to teach students how scientists study the complexity of the
   Earth’s systems and why better El Nino/La Nina forecasts can benefit
   agriculture, natural resource managers and human communities.
