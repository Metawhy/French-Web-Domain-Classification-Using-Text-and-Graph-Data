Lorne Sausage | Scottish Square Sliced Sausages

   image

   Sliced sausage (often known as square sausage, or lorne sausage) is a
   delicacy most often enjoyed in Scotland. Sausage meat - which may be
   pork, beef, or a mixture of the two - is set into a square and sliced
   into pieces generally about 3 inches (8 cm) square by about
   half-an-inch (1 cm) thick. The sausage is rarely a perfect square given
   the minced state of the meat, which is often bulked out with other
   ingredients such as rusk.

   Sliced sausage remains a favourite in Scottish cooked breakfasts and is
   often eaten in a bread roll. Also, the square sliced sausage is the
   ideal size to make a sandwich using one or two slices from a Scottish
   plain loaf (a form of bread).

   The sausage is known as a variety of names throughout Scotland. The
   name “sliced sausage” or simply “slice” or “sausage” are used on the
   west coast and around Glasgow. Lorne sausage appears to be the default
   name in the North of Scotland with lorne, square sausage, square sliced
   sausage and square slice being popular terms on the East Coast. In the
   Highlands it is also known a “square sausage” or simply “square”.

   It is thought that the Lorne sausage was an invention of the Scottish
   comedian Tommy Lorne who lived from 1890 and died in 1935. He was born
   in Kirkintilloch near Glasgow.

   image

   His birth name was Hugh Gallagher Corcoran. Tommy Lorne performed in
   many Scottish theatres and often performed in Glasgow and Edinburgh and
   was much in demand for pantomime. In his own acts he would apply white
   make-up and wear a short kilt, a glengarry, boots that were far too big
   for him and a jacket that was short. He spoke in an hilarious high
   pitched voice. Tommy Lorne was famed for several catchphrases such as
   “In the name of the wee man” and “Ah’ll get ye”, and “If Ah don’t get
   you the coos’ll get ye!”

Kedgeree – A Very Scottish Curry

   image

   Curry powder, eggs, rice…. I haven’t made this one in a while but it’s
   certainly one Scottish recipe you should definitely try.

   Now you might ask the question, “Curry powder in a traditional Scottish
   recipe?” but the answer is Yes, apparently it was a Scottish regiment
   serving in India that married local curry with smoked fish. “Finnan
   haddies” (smoked haddock named for the fishing village of Finnan or
   Findon in Scotland) or “Arbroath smokies” would be best but most smoked
   fish is fine.

   I generally use smoked haddock from the local supermarket but I do try
   to get the ‘undyed’ variety if I can, it’s less garish in colour and
   has a truer smoked flavour.

   This dish is often served as a breakfast alternative, but is equally
   suited as a light lunch or supper dish.

   Ingredients: (serves 4)
     * 2 fillets of smoked haddock, bones and skin removed
     * 4 hard boiled eggs, shelled and chopped roughly
     * 350g/ 3?4lb long grain basmati rice (or brown rice)
     * 300ml/ 10fl oz of milk to poach the fish
     * 50g/ 2oz of butter
     * 750ml/ 11?4 pints of chicken stock
     * One small onion, peeled and finely chopped
     * One bay leaf
     * One teaspoon curry powder (or to your own taste!)
     * Half teaspoon grated nutmeg
     * Ground pepper (to taste)

   Method:
     * Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4.
     * Cook the onion gently in the butter and add the rice, stirring to
       coat the rice in butter.
     * Add the stock and bring to the boil.
     * Add the bay leaf, cover and cook in the oven for about 20 minutes
       or until the rice has absorbed the stock. Remove the bay leaf at
       the end of cooking.
     * Poach the fish in hot milk for five minutes and drain just before
       the rice is ready.
     * Flake the fish.
     * When the rice is ready, stir in the flaked fish, chopped eggs,
       curry powder, nutmeg and pepper, using a fork to stir the flaked
       fish (to prevent the rice from breaking up).
     * Serve with buttered toast and a mug of hot tea.

   Thanks to Derek McGuff for this delicious item

Scotch Whisky Exports Booming

   Scotch Whisky Exports Booming

   Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs Richard Lochhead has welcomed the
   export statistics from the Scotch Whisky Association released today.

Date: Mon, 12 Sep 2011  Source:  Scottish Government

   Hailing this good news for food and drink industry, Mr  Lochhead
   said:“The news that whisky exports have rocketed by a quarter is
   absolutely phenomenal.

   "Our whisky sector is an international success story and more and more
   discerning drinkers around the world are enjoying a dram and a little
   bit of Scotland.

   "The food and drink industry is at the heart of Scotland’s global
   reputation. And it is good to see that while the USA remains the top
   market, the emerging markets are booming too.

   "As we celebrate Scottish Food & Drink Fortnight, where we have already
   announced record growth figures for the industry as a whole, it is
   clear whisky is leading the way with another record year - outstripping
   all trends and reaching new markets each year.

   "We have great ambition for exports from Scotland. Other industries
   should be learning from the long term strategy and continuing
   investment of the Scotch whisky industry.”

   Scotch Whisky Association.

Scotland’s Cheeses - a brief introduction form Taste-of-Scotland.com

   image

   Scotland’s climate and geography are well suited to cheese-making. A
   short production season in Scotland meant that traditional cheeses
   usually required to be capable of being stored (matured) through the
   winter - hence the traditional predominance of hard (matured) cheese in
   Scotland and Britain. However, modern manufacturing techniques have
   enables a range of new cheeses to become available - including soft
   brie and dolcelatte style cheeses.
