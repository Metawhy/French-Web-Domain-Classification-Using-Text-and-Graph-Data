   CaffeineGalore, a barista's musings.
     * sorry for this
     * but i guess i should really fill you into what i've been up to

I haven’t really written on this blog since, well, mid-University.

   I could ramble on and on about everything I’ve done so far in a poetic
   piece of prose (heck why I else did I study humanities), but I think a
   bullet list may be better to keep you all up to date as to what I’ve
   been up to and where I’m at.

   - I am nearly 24 years old. I started this Tumblr at the age of 15.
   Jesus Christ.

   - I graduated with a 2:1 in History (Bsc) from the University of
   Roehampton (London).

   - I still live in London - I now live in West London (I know, how
   bougie) and don’t really plan on leaving anytime soon.

   - I have a lovely boyfriend. He was my housemate at Uni and we ended up
   falling in love. It’s as cute as it sounds and we’ve been going strong
   for 3 whole years.

   - I’m head of business development and marketing for a nifty app called
   Baristas on Tap which you should totally google. It means my day job
   allows me to visit coffee shops and Baristas all day and i’m so
   thankful for that.

   - Before this, I was marketing manager for a group of London shops
   (department of coffee), operations manager for a not-for-profit coffee
   business and head of coffee at McLaren Automotive and Racing.

   - my mum and I’s relationship has strengthened a lot since I was a
   teenager, and I’m so happy to say that. Me and my dad, however, have
   drifted apart.

   - I have a side business, legitimately, called ‘Fuelled by Caffeine’.
   It’s a shop selling coffee merch and i’m a proud momma.

   - I voted to remain in the EU.

   - I’m getting back into vlogging and tumblr-ing because those were some
   of my happiest days and I loved our little community here. I’m slightly
   worried that you all dislike me now.

   - I was offered a 15-month job at Disneyworld Florida and declined it
   because as much as it made me excited, it would not have helped in my
   career progression (i cried for about two weeks).

   - (however this was totally the right decision because) - I’m flying to
   New York City in October, Los Angeles in November and Melbourne early
   next year.

   I guess you could say I’m an adult now.

What's better a better brewed method? Pour-over, French press or traditional?

   in rain with a coffee and find myself at flippin’ St Paul’s. This insta
   post is here to make myself accountable: please slow down and

   Happiness is being in the same room as all of these wonderful people,
   let alone on the front row! One of the highlights to the
   @londoncoffeefestival had to be the ‘women in coffee’ talk they held.
   Super insightful, empowering and motivational. ☕️💁‍♀️...
