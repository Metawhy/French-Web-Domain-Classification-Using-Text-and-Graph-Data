My LDS & Other Projects

   I love to do crafts and have cute handouts and activities for church
   (and school, and friends, and - well you get the idea). I don't
   consider myself creative, but often use the help of others' talents. I
   decided to share what I'm doing for others just like me. It may be a
   link to where I found something or it might even be something *I*
   created. Right now I work as a paraprofessional at my kids' elementary
   - in special ed (autism). I started creating items for my 3rd graders
   this year and can't wait to share them with you. I am the 1st counselor
   in YW (first time in YW is this past year). I also have ideas for cub
   scouts and sunbeams posted, my previous callings.

Good Works #1, Reading 3

   Good Works Experience #1
   Read:
   Mosiah 2:17; 4:26
   17 And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn ^awisdom; that
   ye may learn that when ye are in the ^bservice of
   your ^cfellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.
   26 And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto
   you—that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from
   day to day, that ye may ^awalk guiltless before God—I would that ye
   should ^bimpart of your substance to the ^cpoor, every man according to
   that which he hath, such as ^dfeedingthe hungry, clothing the naked,
   visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually
   and temporally, according to their wants.
   3 Nephi 13:1-4
   1 ^aVerily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the
   poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of
   them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.
   2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before
   you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
   they may have ^aglory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their
   reward.
   3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right
   hand doeth;
   4 That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret,
   himself shall reward thee openly.

Good Works #1, Reading 2

   Good Works Experience #1
   Read:
   Galatians 6:9-10
   9 And let us not be ^aweary in well doing: for in due season we
   shall ^breap, if we faint not.
   10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do ^agood unto
   all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
   James 1:22-27
   22 But be ye ^adoers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
   own selves.
   23 For if any be a ^ahearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
   unto a man beholding his natural face in a ^bglass:
   24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
   forgetteth what manner of man he was.
   25 But whoso looketh into the perfect ^alaw of ^bliberty, and
   continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
   work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
   26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
   his ^atongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s
   religion is^bvain.
   27 Pure ^areligion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
   To ^bvisit the ^cfatherless and ^dwidows in their ^eaffliction, and to
   keep himself ^funspotted from ^gthe ^hworld.

Good Works #1, Reading 1

   Good Works Experience #1,
   Read:
   Matthew 5:13-16 & 25:34-40
   13 ¶ Ye are the ^asalt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
   savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
   nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
   14 Ye are the ^alight of the world. A city that is set on an hill
   cannot be hid.
   15 Neither do men light a ^acandle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
   candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
   16 Let your ^alight so shine before men, that they may see your
   good ^bworks, and ^cglorify your Father which is in heaven.
   34 Then shall the King say unto them on his ^aright hand, Come,
   ye ^bblessed of my Father, ^cinherit the ^dkingdomprepared for you from
   the foundation of the world:
   35 For I was an ^ahungred, and ye ^bgave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
   gave me drink: I was a ^cstranger, and ye took me in:
   36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye ^avisited me: I was
   in ^bprison, and ye came unto me.
   37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
   an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave theedrink?
   38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
   clothed thee?
   39 Or when saw we thee ^asick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
   40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
   Inasmuch as ye have ^adone it unto one of the ^bleastof these
   my ^cbrethren, ye have done it unto me.

Individual Worth Value 3

   Read:
   D&C 18:10
   10 Remember the ^aworth of ^bsouls is great in the sight of God;
   D&C 121:45
   45 Let thy ^abowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to
   the household of faith, and let ^bvirtue garnish thy thoughts
   unceasingly; then shall thy ^cconfidence wax strong in
   the ^dpresence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil
   upon thy soul as the ^edews from heaven.
   Every day for two weeks notice worthwhile qualities and attributes of
   others.  Acknowledge them verbally or in writing.  In your journal
   write what you have learned about the worth of individuals and how your
   own confidence grows when you build others.

A Bag of Mints {Teacher Appreciation}

   [mint+4.jpg]
   This is an easy and inexpensive gift to make for the teachers, but the
   little message covers a lot.  I gathered a variety of minty treats and
   put them in a cello bag.  I made the toppers in three different styles
   so you can pick what you like best (one pictures above):
   The little saying I found on the internet, but have no idea who wrote
   it to credit says:
   Thanks for your commitmint to help me learn.
   Thanks for your encouragemint to always to my best.
   Thanks for your involvemint in my life.
   Thanks for your investmint of time and energy to make school such a
   great place to be.
   Thanks for making each day an enjoymint.
   Thanks for helping to create a nice environmint  for me to learn and
   grow.
   Everything you have done this year has really mint a lot to me!
   Some mint ideas: Peppermints, lifesavers, mint gum, Altoids, mint
   M&M's, butter-mints, Andes mints, etc.
   This last year I made these gifts again, but I changed the packaging a
   little.  I only used wintergreen lifesavers.  I bought a large bag at
   Costco and had enough to cover a lot of people.  I only put about 15
   mints in a bag, but it turned out beautifully.  I had enough for my
   daughter's teacher and the teacher that comes in her class to help, the
   7 specialists (librarian, assistant librarian, computer teacher, art
   teacher, 2 PE teachers), the office staff, the principle and assistant
   principle, nurse, and the middle school teachers.  We are on a major
   budget this year so I was very pleased with how nicely it turned out
   and how little it cost to cover all those people!

Absent

   I know that I haven't been around in a LONG TIME.  I'm glad to see
   people still coming and downloading things.  I'm trying to figure out
   Google drive/Google docs.  I originally had everything stored on Google
   docs and you could just hit the link and download, but know most of my
   things are on Google drive and you have to ask permission to download.
   I'm trying to figure it out, but in the meantime, ask away and I'll
   grant permission as quickly as possible!
   I hope to blog again, especially things I already have pictures of.  I
   hope I can find the time.  My world has been turned upside down the
   last two years and I feel like I'm just scraping by.  Maybe one day
   I'll be able to share my story, but for now I'm staying busy working
   full time - now at an apartment complex on the other side of the
   country - and trying to keep up with my very busy three children.  I
   miss the blog, I miss creating, and I miss giving.  Last year and this
   year hasn't been very eventful for my kids' teachers.  However, my new
   work family has received a few things.  I've also gotten horrible about
   taking pictures.  It is hard to share without pictures!  Now that
   things are a little more normal again maybe I can fit in a post or two.
   I appreciate all those who stop by.  I had no idea how many people
   downloaded my stuff until I had to grant permission to each person!  It
   appears there is about one comment left for every 500 downloads!
   Amazing.
