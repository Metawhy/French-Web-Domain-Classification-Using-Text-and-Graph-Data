     * RNN Training Tips and Tricks
       Monitoring Validation Loss vs. Training Loss If you’re somewhat new
       to Machine Learning or Neural Networks it can take a bit of
       expertise to get good models. The most important quantity to keep
       track of is the difference between your training loss (printed
       during training) and the validation loss (printed once in a while
       when the RNN is run on the validation data (by default every 1000
       iterations)). In particular: If your training loss is much lower
       than validation loss then this means the network might be
       overfitting. Solutions to this are to decrease your network size,
       or to increase dropout. For example you could try dropout of 0.5
       and so on.

     * Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs in Keras
       Neural networks like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
       networks are able to almost seamlessly model problems with multiple
       input variables. This is a great benefit in time series
       forecasting, where classical linear methods can be difficult to
       adapt to multivariate or multiple input forecasting problems. In
       this tutorial, you will discover how you can develop an LSTM model
       for multivariate time series forecasting in the Keras deep learning
       library. After completing this tutorial, you will know: How to
       transform a raw dataset into something we can use for time series
       forecasting. How to prepare data and fit an LSTM for a multivariate
       time series forecasting problem. How to make a forecast and rescale
       the result back into the original units.

     * Why does Keras LSTM batch size used for prediction have to be the
       same as fitting batch size? - Stack Overflow
       When using a Keras LSTM to predict on time series data I've been
       getting errors when I'm trying to train the model using a batch
       size of 50, while then trying to predict on the same model using a
       batch size of 1 (ie just predicting the next value). Why am I not
       able to train and fit the model with multiple batches at once, and
       then use that model to predict for anything other than the same
       batch size. It doesn't seem to make sense, but then I could easily
       be missing something about this.
