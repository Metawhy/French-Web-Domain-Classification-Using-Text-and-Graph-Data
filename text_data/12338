ALTA

   A C++ library for BRDF analysis and fitting

   ALTA is designed to help the analysis and use of acquired material data
   such as BRDFs (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions). It
   provides a generic set of tools and softwares to analyze, and fit
   BRDF data and models.

   The manao project aims at studying how light, matter and shape act
   together in synergies, at the convergence of Digital Optics and
   Computer Graphics, providing for more powerful representations of
   appearance. Such a high-level approach is to contrast with the main
   trend of modern Computer Graphics to study light, shape and matter
   separately.

   The manao project specifically aims at considering information
   transfer, first from the real world to the virtual world (acquisition &
   creation), then from computers to observers (visualization & display).
   For this purpose, we will target representations, algorithms and
   unified optical/digital systems that decrease the required
   computational resources.

   The benefit of our approach is two-fold: provide fast communication
   between the real world (original data, human users and sensors) and the
   digital 3D world; develop new uses of Computer Graphics for scientists
   (e.g., Optical Science, Archeology), artists, and industrials.
