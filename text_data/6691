THE Womenability Report

   Womenability was founded on the idea that seemingly small actions can
   have big results. Born out of a conversation between friends on the
   outskirts of Paris, Womenability is a unique NGO with a simple yet
   radical mission: to make gender equality a reality in the world’s
   cities.

   Using exploratory walks to gather both qualitative and quantitative
   data regarding the experiences of women in public space, Womenability
   traveled to 25 cities across six continents over the course of six
   months.

   This report is the product of this research-action project. It reveals
   the numerous, and sometimes unexpected, obstacles to the equal access
   and enjoyment of public spaces by women, from a lack of green spaces,
   accessible public transportation, and public toilets, to persistent
   harassment and outright violence.

   Building on these experiences and observations, the report offers a
   series of recommendations and best practices, many developed by women
   themselves, for creating the gender equal cities of the future.

   Womenability believes that it is up to all of us to make this vision a
   reality.

Our purpose

   Womenability is an adventure as crazy as it is necessary, with one
   simple goal: to makeÂ gender equality a reality in the place where more
   than half of the world’s population lives: cities.

   So what do we do? Womenability’s objective is to propose concrete
   solutions to improve cities via international guidelines for gender
   equal cities.

   We have travelled to 17 countries to collect data using exploratory
   walks. We have also met with amazing female mayors, NGO leaders and
   change makers.

   We are now developing actions to let people know what the issues are
   and how to implement solutions
