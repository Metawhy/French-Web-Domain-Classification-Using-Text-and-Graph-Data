   The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 is a key legislation for both
   domestic and international conservation. The act aims to provide a
   framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and
   their habitats.

   By providing States with financial assistance and incentives to develop
   and maintain conservation programs the Act serves as a method to meet
   many of the United States’ international responsibilities to treaties
   and conventions such as the Convention on International Trade of
   Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Western
   Hemisphere Convention. The multinational species conservation acts
   function as amendments to the ESA and grant the division the authority
   to providing funding for projects that aim to conserver and protect
   these species.

Aleutian Islands WWII National Monument

   During World War II the remote Aleutian Islands, home to the Unangan
   (Aleut) people for over 8,000 years, became a fiercely contested
   battleground in the Pacific. This thousand-mile-long archipelago saw
   invasion by Japanese forces, the occupation of two islands; a mass
   relocation of Unangan civilians; a 15-month air war; and one of the
   deadliest battles in the Pacific Theater.

   The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was enacted on October 21,
   1972. All marine mammals are protected under the MMPA. The MMPA
   prohibits, with certain exceptions, the "take" of marine mammals in
   U.S. waters and by U.S. citizens on the high seas, and the importation
   of marine mammals and marine mammal products into the U.S.

   Jurisdiction for MMPA is shared by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   (Service) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The
   Service’s Branch of Permits is responsible for issuing take permits
   when exceptions are made to MMPA.

   In general, exceptions may be made for:
    1. Pre-MMPA specimens taken before December 21, 1972
    2. International Agreements entered into by the United States before
       December 21, 1972
    3. Alaska natives
    4. Scientific research, public display, enhancing the survival or
       recovery of a species, and incidental take in commercial fisheries
    5. Waivers granted by the U.S. Government

MMPA and CITES

   All cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), all sirenians
   (manatees and dugongs) and several marine carnivores (seals, otters,
   walrus, and polar bears) are protected under the Convention on
   International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
   (CITES).

   CITES applies to international shipments of listed species. It does not
   apply to activities conducted solely within the United States. The
   Service issues CITES permits for all marine mammals protected by CITES.
   For permitting information for marine mammals, visit our Permits page.

   For more information on MMPA, visit the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
