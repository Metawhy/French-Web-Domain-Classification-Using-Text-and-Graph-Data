OpenMPT 1.28.01.00 released

   Posted on 23 December, 2018 - 13:10 by Saga Musix

   For more than a year, we have only brought you little bugfix updates to
   make OpenMPT 1.27 more stable and improve some details, while working
   on OpenMPT 1.28 at the same time. It took us longer than expected, but
   now we are finally proud to release this new milestone, and it brings a
   great number of new features, improvements and bugfixes.

   On a personal note, this release marks my ten year anniversary as an
   OpenMPT developer. It has been a great time making this software better
   and better with every new release, and if you look back at OpenMPT's
   state in 2008, I hope you can agree that the software has matured a lot
   in this time. Here's to ten more years of OpenMPT development with many
   new features and other improvements!

   Here is a short summary of the most notable new features:

   have decided to release another OpenMPT 1.27 update to correct a few
   problems.
   This also means that the example song competition has been extended as
   well.

OpenMPT 1.28.01.00 released

   Posted on 23 December, 2018 - 13:10 by Saga Musix

   For more than a year, we have only brought you little bugfix updates to
   make OpenMPT 1.27 more stable and improve some details, while working
   on OpenMPT 1.28 at the same time. It took us longer than expected, but
   now we are finally proud to release this new milestone, and it brings a
   great number of new features, improvements and bugfixes.

   On a personal note, this release marks my ten year anniversary as an
   OpenMPT developer. It has been a great time making this software better
   and better with every new release, and if you look back at OpenMPT's
   state in 2008, I hope you can agree that the software has matured a lot
   in this time. Here's to ten more years of OpenMPT development with many
   new features and other improvements!

   Here is a short summary of the most notable new features:

   problems.
   This also means that the example song competition has been extended as
   well.

   The following improvements have been made:

   Another bugfix update for OpenMPT 1.27 has been released today. This is
   likely to be the last maintenance update before the next feature
   release, OpenMPT 1.28. And while you are already here: Have you heard
   of the new example song competition for the upcoming release?

   These are the most important changes in this release:
