Terminating Service for 8Chan

   Tweet
     * Matthew Prince

   The mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio are horrific
   tragedies. In the case of the El Paso shooting, the suspected terrorist
   gunman appears to have been inspired by the forum website known as
   8chan. Based on evidence we've seen, it appears that he posted a screed
   to the site immediately before beginning his terrifying attack on the
   El Paso Walmart killing 20 people.

   Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Nearly the same thing
   happened on 8chan before the terror attack in Christchurch, New
   Zealand. The El Paso shooter specifically referenced the Christchurch
   incident and appears to have been inspired by the largely unmoderated
   discussions on 8chan which glorified the previous massacre. In a
   separate tragedy, the suspected killer in the Poway, California
   synagogue shooting also posted a hate-filled “open letter” on 8chan.
   8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate.

   8chan is among the more than 19 million Internet properties that use
   Cloudflare's service. We just sent notice that we are terminating 8chan
   as a customer effective at midnight tonight Pacific Time. The rationale
   is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that
   lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths. Even if 8chan may not
   have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their
   hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in
   violating its spirit.

   We do not take this decision lightly. Cloudflare is a network provider.
   In pursuit of our goal of helping build a better internet, we’ve
   considered it important to provide our security services broadly to
   make sure as many users as possible are secure, and thereby making
   cyberattacks less attractive — regardless of the content of those
   websites.  Many of our customers run platforms of their own on top of
   our network. If our policies are more conservative than theirs it
   effectively undercuts their ability to run their services and set their
   own policies. We reluctantly tolerate content that we find
   reprehensible, but we draw the line at platforms that have demonstrated
   they directly inspire tragic events and are lawless by design. 8chan
   has crossed that line. It will therefore no longer be allowed to use
   our services.

What Will Happen Next

   Unfortunately, we have seen this situation before and so we have a good
   sense of what will play out. Almost exactly two years ago we made the
   determination to kick another disgusting site off Cloudflare's network:
   the Daily Stormer. That caused a brief interruption in the site's
   operations but they quickly came back online using a Cloudflare
   competitor. That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact
   that they didn't respond to legal process. Today, the Daily Stormer is
   still available and still disgusting. They have bragged that they have
   more readers than ever. They are no longer Cloudflare's problem, but
   they remain the Internet's problem.

   I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While
   removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing
   to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address
   why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of
   the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. In taking this
   action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the
   Internet's.

   In the two years since the Daily Stormer what we have done to try and
   solve the Internet’s deeper problem is engage with law enforcement and
   civil society organizations to try and find solutions. Among other
   things, that resulted in us cooperating around monitoring potential
   hate sites on our network and notifying law enforcement when there was
   content that contained an indication of potential violence. We will
   continue to work within the legal process to share information when we
   can to hopefully prevent horrific acts of violence. We believe this is
   our responsibility and, given Cloudflare's scale and reach, we are
   hopeful we will continue to make progress toward solving the deeper
   problem.

Rule of Law

   We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of
   content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often. Some have wrongly
   speculated this is due to some conception of the United States' First
   Amendment. That is incorrect. First, we are a private company and not
   bound by the First Amendment. Second, the vast majority of our
   customers, and more than 50% of our revenue, comes from outside the
   United States where the First Amendment and similarly libertarian
   freedom of speech protections do not apply. The only relevance of the
   First Amendment in this case and others is that it allows us to choose
   who we do and do not do business with; it does not obligate us to do
   business with everyone.

   Instead our concern has centered around another much more universal
   idea: the Rule of Law. The Rule of Law requires policies be transparent
   and consistent. While it has been articulated as a framework for how
   governments ensure their legitimacy, we have used it as a touchstone
   when we think about our own policies.

   We have been successful because we have a very effective technological
   solution that provides security, performance, and reliability in an
   affordable and easy-to-use way. As a result of that, a huge portion of
   the Internet now sits behind our network. 10% of the top million, 17%
   of the top 100,000, and 19% of the top 10,000 Internet properties use
   us today. 10% of the Fortune 1,000 are paying Cloudflare customers.

   Cloudflare is not a government. While we've been successful as a
   company, that does not give us the political legitimacy to make
   determinations on what content is good and bad. Nor should it.
   Questions around content are real societal issues that need politically
   legitimate solutions. We will continue to engage with lawmakers around
   the world as they set the boundaries of what is acceptable in their
   countries through due process of law. And we will comply with those
   boundaries when and where they are set.

   Europe, for example, has taken a lead in this area. As we've seen
   governments there attempt to address hate and terror content online,
   there is recognition that different obligations should be placed on
   companies that organize and promote content — like Facebook and YouTube
   — rather than those that are mere conduits for that content. Conduits,
   like Cloudflare, are not visible to users and therefore cannot be
   transparent and consistent about their policies.

   The unresolved question is how should the law deal with platforms that
   ignore or actively thwart the Rule of Law? That's closer to the
   situation we have seen with the Daily Stormer and 8chan. They are
   lawless platforms. In cases like these, where platforms have been
   designed to be lawless and unmoderated, and where the platforms have
   demonstrated their ability to cause real harm, the law may need
   additional remedies. We and other technology companies need to work
   with policy makers in order to help them understand the problem and
   define these remedies. And, in some cases, it may mean moving
   enforcement mechanisms further down the technical stack.

Our Obligation

   Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet. At some level
   firing 8chan as a customer is easy. They are uniquely lawless and that
   lawlessness has contributed to multiple horrific tragedies. Enough is
   enough.

   What's hard is defining the policy that we can enforce transparently
   and consistently going forward. We, and other technology companies like
   us that enable the great parts of the Internet, have an obligation to
   help propose solutions to deal with the parts we're not proud of.
   That's our obligation and we're committed to it.

   Unfortunately the action we take today won’t fix hate online. It will
   almost certainly not even remove 8chan from the Internet. But it is the
   right thing to do. Hate online is a real issue. Here are some
   organizations that have active work to help address it:
     * Anti-Defamation League
     * Gen Next Foundation
     * Perspective API
     * 7 Cups

   Our whole Cloudflare team’s thoughts are with the families grieving in
   El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio this evening.

                         Terminating Service for 8Chan
