Awards: From Deepika Padukone to Alia Bhatt, Bollywood celebs root for purple
hue

Regal, mysterious and sophisticated, here‚Äôs why celebs have fallen for this
intense hue

                                 [INS: :INS]

   A custom Gaurav Gupta lilac lace gown with a veil and a trail added
   drama to Deepika Padukone‚Äôs look at the award ceremony held in the city
   on Wednesday evening. Enough for her husband Ranveer Singh to comment
   on her social media feed, ‚ÄúBaby... you‚Äôre killin me (sic).‚Äù Just a
   couple of days before that, the Gully Boy actor himself opted for an
   overcoat in the same colour when he was spotted outside Karan Johar‚Äôs
   office.
   Twinning on separate occasions apart, looks like purple haze has spread
   across B-Town. And why not, as designer Anuj Lalwani points out, ‚ÄúLilac
   is the star colour of Spring Summer 2019.‚Äù
   SOPHISTICATED AND ENCHANTING
   Before the power couple, Alia Bhatt rocked a tracksuit in this
   tincture. It was a fresh swap to the millennial pink. Designer Aniket
   Satam corroborates, ‚ÄúDusty lilac and intense lavender have successfully
   taken over the craze of the millennial pink.‚Äù He observes that it‚Äôs
   time to tease one‚Äôs dark side with a sophisticated dash of pastel tone.
   ‚ÄúThis shade isn‚Äôt ultra-sweet and has the mysterious quality of the
   dark purple,‚Äù says he. Designer Pallavi Mohan agrees that lavender‚Äôs
   intense quality is subtle without being too cute or sweet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
   feminine yet strong like the women today, who balances her grace with
   mature dignity,‚Äù she weighs in. Rightly so! Taapsee Pannu opted for a
   desi bohochic look in Sonam Luthria separates ‚Äî a purple skirt, white
   shirt and floral koti ‚Äî at a film festival. The Mission Mangal actress
   also wore a lavender sari with a black blouse at the film‚Äôs promotion.
   ‚ÄúIt has the undertone of regalia yet not harsh and in your face,‚Äù
   Pallavi states.
   FOR BOTH THE SEXES

                                 [INS: :INS]

   It‚Äôs not just women but also men who have included the colour in their
   wardrobe. For instance, Arjun Kapoor wore a hoodie in the same tint
   recently. ‚ÄúPurple has an old-school romance quality. It works well with
   menswear as it‚Äôs masculine but in a feminine way,‚Äù Pallavi explains.
   Aniket adds that it has a sense of enchanting quality that‚Äôs enduring
   yet softer and is great for both the sexes. Anuj drives home the point,
   ‚ÄúKings and emperors used to wear purple. The colour and its hues were
   rare, and precious dyes were produced by extracting the juice from a
   variety of sea snails. A quarter of a million snails would make an
   ounce of dye,‚Äù says he.
   TEAM IT UP WELL

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Purple works well with other pastels, especially chalk-mauve, dusty
   pink and onion pink, Pallavi tells us. She further adds that it can be
   best worn with metallic shades such as gun metal and rustic copper.
   ‚ÄúAlso, it can easily be passed off as day colour or an evening shade,‚Äù
   says she. According to Aniket, it goes well with buttercup yellow, mint
   green or cantaloupe orange. ‚ÄúThe faint-hearted can go mono- tonal mix
   with deep grape, amethyst or even berry shades,‚Äù he concludes.

   Vijay Deverakonda 10:19 PM

New Movies: Vijay Seems To Be The Only Hope For Raashi Khanna

   [All-Movie-Fans-Vijay-Deverakonda-Seems-To-Be-The-Only-Hope-For-Raashi.
   jpg]
   Heroines who share screen space with Vijay Deverakonda stay in the
   limelight for at least from the formal launch till a week
   post-theatrical release either because of controversies or lip-locks or
   link-ups rumors. This happened in the case of Rashmika Mandanna,
   Shalini Pandey and Priyanka Jawalkar. That could be one of the reasons
   why mid-range Actresses are more than happy to work with the 'Arjun
   Reddy' Star.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Raashi Khanna is hoping to get all the attention with her first flick
   with Vijay Deverakonda titled as 'World Famous Lover'. This Beauty gave
   the impression that she entered the top league with 'Jai Lava Kusa' but
   the failure of 'Srinivasa Kalyanam' and being adamant on remuneration
   did a lot of damage to her career. She is now hoping to make it big
   with the Vijay Deverakonda-starrer.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   In fact, Raashi Khanna has four other projects in the pipeline (Venky
   Mama,  Shaitan Ka Bachcha, Sanga Thamizhan, Kadaisi Vivasayi). She,
   however, pinned all her hopes on 'World Famous Lover' directed by
   Kranthi Madhav of 'Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju' fame. Why because Raashi
   is aware of the spike in the graph of Rashmika Mandanna and Shalini
   Pandey after working with Vijay Deverakonda.

Picture Story of the day: Flawless Beauty Classic Quote!

   [All-Movie-Fans-Samantha-Glamourous-Pose.jpg]
   Can anybody guess what's going on in the mind of Samantha after
   watching the above photograph? It can be understood that she was
   thinking about something which happened in the past. And the guess has
   come out true with the quote placed by the Golden Leg of Tollywood:
   'Find solace in touching your deepest wounds .. there you will find
   yourself .. there you will find peace'.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Was Samantha thinking about the break-up with Siddharth? or Is she
   recalling the tough phase during the making of 'Jabardasth' because of
   health issues? It could be anything!

                                 [INS: :INS]

   The Year 2019 has been phenomenal for Akkineni Babu. She delivered two
   back-to-back blockbusters (Majili, Oh Baby). Samantha's interesting
   line-up of films makes the married beauties who failed to make it big
   go green with envy.
