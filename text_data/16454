How To Go Viral: Lessons From The Most Shared Content

   What content were you reading this year? Did it include some of the
   most shared articles of 2015? We think it’s possible to
   reverse-engineer heavily shared content to help us learn to make things
   go viral in the future.

   Why does certain content get shared so much and go viral? Last year we
   looked at 100m posts and highlighted the common characteristics
   of viral content. This year we added over 1 billion articles to our
   content database and looked again at the most shared posts. Our
   analysis shows that viral posts remain outliers, and
   unfortunately there is no magic formula to go viral.

   However, there are insights from viral content that we can use to
   improve the shareability and engagement of our own content. The posts
   we are looking at in this review are primarily consumer posts, we have
   previously examined the best B2B posts of 2015.

   Below we have provided examples of the most shared posts of 2015 and
   tried to break down why they went viral. If you haven’t got time
   to review them individually, you can jump straight to our conclusions.

   Our review has identified four different elements which occur
   frequently with viral content. A combination of these elements may not
   guarantee viral success but they can improve shareability. Look out for
   these elements in each of the viral posts below.
   viral-elements

Viral Posts Are Insightful Outliers

   Viral posts are not the norm. Our examples below include posts with
   millions of shares. However, these viral posts are exceptional even for
   very largest viral sites, as we can see from the graphs below. These
   show the distribution of shares across posts for BuzzFeed and the New
   York Times.  buzzfeed-nytimes

   There are fewer and fewer posts as the numbers of shares increase.
   Going viral is like alchemy, and even the best sites cannot
   consistently replicate the success of their top posts  (if they could,
   they would). Like most publishers, the top sites have a lot of steady
   performing content and a few huge hits. The top three most shared
   articles on the Huffington Post demonstrate this quite clearly as we
   can see below. The top post got almost double the shares of the third
   most shared post. This is a pattern we see again and again.
   huuf_post-top_3

   Thus viral posts are exceptional, and there is no simple formula for
   viral success–unless possibly you are an international celebrity. For
   our analysis we excluded content about and from celebrities, musicians
   and films, even though they can drive huge volumes of traffic. For
   example, Adele’s recent release of her song Helllo on YouTube raced
   quickly past 500m views.
   adele

   What if you’re not Adele? (and If you are Adele: Hello, how are you,
   please feel free to share this post). What can you do to create more
   shareable content?

   In our view these viral posts provide insights into how we might make
   our own content more shareable, even if it doesn’t go viral. Here are
   our lessons from the most shared content of 2015.

How To Go Viral

1) Surprise People (Facts & Images)

   People like to share content–both facts and images–that surprises. They
   also love to share new research and trends, particularly if they
   challenge current perceptions. Marketo’s 2013 survey with Brian Carter
   on why people share on Facebook found that people love to share amazing
   and surprising content. This view is supported by our review of
   2015’s most shared content.

   Example: Champagne Prevents Alzheimer’s Disease (938,000 shares)

   The most shared content on the London Evening Standard site this year
   was a post that probably made many of us happy. It highlighted new
   research showing that champagne can help prevent dementia and
   Alzheimer’s Disease. Very welcome news at Christmas. Cheers!
   standard-champagne


   Example: The Cause of Addiction Is Not What You Think (2m shares)

   The most shared article on Huffington Post this year was also
   surprising. It combined research with a provocative title. The post was
   about addiction, a current topic of discussion and interest. The post
   highlighted new research challenging the prevailing wisdom about
   addiction and highlighted the significance of isolation and loneliness.
   The post was clearly thought-provoking and made people keen to share.

   This post went viral on Facebook as we can see below. In most cases we
   found Facebook was the key network in igniting and driving viral
   content.
   huff-post
(Huff Post missing Twitter share count, which we can see with BuzzSumo Chrome Ex
tension)


   A subset of surprising facts is new research and trends. The latest
   slides from Mary Meeker on Internet Trends are a good example of highly
   shared B2B content with nearly 3m views. It also helps that they’re in
   Slideshare format which makes them easy to digest — much easier than a
   dense report.

   Viral Elements – Surprising content backed by research, provocative
   titles and easy to scan formats.

2) Leverage A Trend, Particularly Zombies

   We all know that the trend is our friend. Commenting on, or including,
   in-vogue topics in your content can increase engagement with your
   audience. In 2015, if in doubt about popular topics, write a Zombie
   story.

   Example: Zombie-Themed Cruise (1.5m shares)

   This is an example we would not normally predict to go viral. It is
   simply an article about a Zombie-themed cruise; however, the reaction
   was huge. The post got over 400,000 comments. Yep, that is 400,000
   comments. It was fun and very much on trend. Who would have thought
   that Zombies would be viral?
   zombie-post

   Fox news is a popular site, but this post dominated their other most
   shared content. It got almost five times the shares of their next most
   popular articles, demonstrating again that viral posts are outliers.
   Fox was not able to reproduce this level of sharing with any other
   posts or even come close to it.
   zombie-list

   Viral elements: Content about a popular topic or trend. But remember
   that there’s no guarantee.

3) Inspire People

   Inspirational quotes, including images with inspiring text, have become
   a very popular form of content on the internet. Insipiring content can
   take many forms, including stories like those below, but there seems to
   be no shortage of appetite for inspirational quotes.

   Example: 51 Beautiful Sentences in Literature (1.4m shares)

   BuzzFeed remains the master of the curated viral list post. We hate to
   admit it, but list posts remain one of the most shareable forms of
   content.

   This curation of 51 beautiful literature quotes had over 9m views and
   over 1.4m shares. Most people have favourite books and quotes.
   buzzfeed-quotes

   Viral elements: Inspirational quotes, curated content, list format that
   is easily scannable. And yep, list posts still do very well. Which
   brings us to:

4) Create Stunning Picture List Posts

   We have previously identified picture list posts as an ideal format for
   viral content. Images are very powerful on the internet and picture
   list posts enhance this power with the shareability of curation and
   list posts.

   Example: 52 Places To Go In 2015 (522,000 shares)

   This was the 4th most shared post on the New York Times this year and
   achieved over 500k shares. It is a list post with beautiful pictures
   that appeals to the love of travel and adventure.
   ny-post-2


   Example: Overpopulation, Overconsumption in Pictures (700,000 shares)

   Beautiful images are inherently shareable but photos do not need to be
   of beautiful things. This series of images on The Guardian demonstrated
   much that is ugly about the world but did so using very high quality
   surprising images. Like the earlier example, the post is very
   surprising, thought-provoking, and visually rich – key viral elements.
   guardian-post

   This article was the second most shared post on the Guardian this year.
   guardian-list
   Viral elements:  Visually rich posts with awe-inspiring graphics, and
   curated list posts.

5) Exploit Cute Animals & Babies

   Yes, you read that right. Cat posts have become cliche on the internet.
   Dress a cute cat in a Halloween outfit and you have the makings of a
   very shareable post. It is not only cats, other pets and babies do
   equally well.

   Example: This Site Will Make A Stuffed Animal Clone Of Your Pet
   (683,000 shares)

   We took this example from Gizmodo. You might expect to see cat posts do
   well on big viral sites such as BuzzFeed, but less so on sites such as
   Gizmodo. However, Gizmodo’s top post this year by some margin was about
   pets.
   stuffed-animal-list

   The post received over 680,000 shares.
   stuffed-animal-post

   Babies are also a good substitute for pets, or is that the other way
   around?

   Viral elements: Cats, dogs, pets and babies. The Gizmodo post was also
   surprising, or maybe not if you are a pet lover.

6) Be Amusing

   People like to share entertaining content. A study by the New York
   Times found one of the most common reasons people share content is to
   bring valuable entertaining content to other friends. Make ’em laugh,
   and you’re on your way to going viral.

   Example: Earth Endangered By New Strain Of Fact-Resistant Humans (1.4m
   Shares)

   For example, this amusing post on the New Yorker got twice as many
   shares as any other post on the site this year. It may have also tapped
   into a trend about people questioning scientific evidence.
   new-yorker-post n_yorker_list

   Example: When You Realise, You’ve Had One Too Many (827,000 shares)

   People love to share amusing videos, and video is a fast growing format
   on Facebook. This short video was one of the top Vines this year with
   over 56m loops.
   vine-video vine-list

   Viral elements: Amusing posts and videos. Our first example leveraged a
   current issue whilst the second leveraged a cute kid.

7) Be Controversial

   Controversy engages people though it carries a degree of risk.
   By nature controversial posts can be divisive. However, people
   often share to be part of a tribe supporting a particular view and to
   show their loyalty or belonging.

   Example: Donald Trump Facebook Posts (millions of interactions)

   We had a look at the Facebook posts of Donald Trump and filtered out
   those with the most engagement using our Facebook Analyzer tool. Donald
   Trump may be divisive, but he has engaged a tribe with similar views
   through his posts.
   donaldtrump

   If we look at the likes and shares of posts on Donald Trump’s Facebook
   page over the last 6 months, we can see that his controversial
   statements have driven a relatively high level of interaction on
   Facebook, and it’s growing.
   trump-chart

   Viral elements: Controversial opinions about trending topics. If you
   find your tribe, and it’s big enough, then they’ll help you go viral.

8) Quiz People

   People love a quiz, particularly if it tells them something about
   themselves. People also like interactive content which they can share
   with friends, for example a popular UK quiz was How Northern Are you?
   Most successful quizzes encourage users to share the quiz and their
   result immediately upon completion. This works especially well if the
   result portrays you in a positive light.

   Example: What Is Your Most Dominant Character Trait? (3.9m shares)

   This personality quiz was the second most shared post on PlayBuzz this
   year with almost 4m shares. The top post was another quiz ‘Can We Guess
   The Level of your Education?‘. PlayBuzz has become a master of the
   viral quiz, and if you haven’t already studied their viral content, it
   is definitely worth a look.
   playbuzz-quiz


   Example: The Color Quiz (5m Shares)

   This post was a classic example of viral Facebook content. It drew you
   in from the very first screen and appealed to your instinct to test
   yourself. It was also something people wanted to share, as demonstrated
   by almost 5m shares. Sharing your percentile score (assuming you did
   ok) also makes it appealing.
   colour-quiz

   This post exploded on Facebook, and its reach was out of all proportion
   to shares of other content from the same site as shown below. The site
   has subsequently run a number of quizzes but created nothing to match
   the success of this first post. That’s a side lesson–you can’t just
   re-run what worked and be assured a second viral result. Content
   formats can get old quickly.
   colour-list


   Interactive content is a variation on quizzes and can also do very
   well, as we will see with this next post.

   Example: Baby Name Popularity (781,000 shares)

   The most shared post on Time this year was on the most popular baby
   names. You simply enter you name and year of birth, and the site
   calculates what your name would be now or in other decades based on the
   popularity of your name when you were born.
   baby-names my-name

   This article also made it very easy to share your results with your
   friends on Facebook or Twitter.

   Viral element: Easy-to-take quizzes that highlight something about the
   user. Interactive content formats and encouragement of sharing.

9) Provide Warnings

   The 2014 Marketo and Brian Carter research found that people shared
   content to provide warnings to other people about dangers such as a
   scam. This continues to be the case in 2015 as we found a number of
   most shared posts that were warnings.

   Example: Recall Of Kids’ Tylenol (474,000 shares)

   The most shared post of Webmd.com this year was a warning about a
   recall which had four times as many shares as other posts on the site.
   Interestingly there was other warning content at Webmd, but the Tylenol
   post was particularly viral.
   warning-list

   Viral element:  Timely warnings or cautions in your field could win you
   an audience as it’s helpful content to share.

10) Tell Them The Secrets Of Success

   Most people want to be successful. People also like to share content
   that is valuable or helpful to others. Thus posts designed to help
   people achieve success have the potential to go viral, if the content
   delivers.

   Example: How Successful People Stay Calm (127,000 shares)

   This is our first B2B example, which was one of the top shared posts on
   LinkedIn this year. It’s had over 3.6m views on LinkedIn.

   Based on our look at content that performs well on LinkedIn, it’s clear
   that the word “successful” in the title helps. This particular title
   also taps into the current trend and interest in mindfulness.
   linkedin-post linkedin-list

   Viral elements: Tips on being successful, practical, helpful content
   and leveraging the current interest in Mindfulness.

11) Health, Diet & Fitness Tips

   Who doesn’t want to get healthier? Health was a popular topic in 2015.
   Interestingly, three of the most shared posts on BuzzFeed this year
   were about health, as seen below.
   buzzfeed-health

   Example: The Only 12 Exercises You Need (968,000 shares)

   This post appealed not only to a desire to be healthy but also to your
   budget. One noticeable feature was that the post included individual
   images that were sized and ready for Pinterest. The post was pinned
   over 500,000 times.
   12-exercises

   Viral elements: Health, diet and fitness tips. Good use of imagery, a
   form of picture list post, how-to posts that will help people improve
   themselves.

12) Tell Them Secrets Of Love & Dating

   Love is the drug, as Bryan Ferry put it, and it appears that the right
   content on love or dating has a lot of potential to go viral.

   Example: To Fall In Love With Anyone, Do This. (885,000 shares)

   The most shared posts on the New York Times this year are outliers,
   gaining a lot more shares than other posts, and most of these articles
   are arguably not news. The second most shared post on the new York
   Times caught our attention about falling in love.
   nytimes-list
   The post challenged a common preconception about love, as it says you
   can can fall in love with anyone–not just your soulmate. This post got
   significantly more shares than the 3rd and 4th most shared posts on the
   New York Times and almost double the 5th most shared. It is also a form
   of “how to” post, and has a great headline that you can’t not love.

   ny-post


   Example: This Is How We Date Now (1.6m shares)

   This is a variation on the theme of love and soumates. This post
   resonated with the audience and was the most shared post on
   Thoughtcatalog.com this year by some margin with over 1.6m shares.


   how-we_date

   Viral elements: Insights into love and dating. Great headlines and one
   was also a ‘how to’ post that had an interesting claim.

13) Share The Secret To A Long Life

   The cause of existential angst, according to Sarte, is knowing we are
   going to die. He also said “hell is other people,” so he probably
   wasn’t on Facebook. Whether you agree with him or not, it seems we are
   all keen to find ways to avoid an early grave.

   Example: 109-Year Old Woman Says Secret To Long Life Is Avoiding Men
   (1.9m shares)

   This video post was the second most shared article on the Huffington
   Post this year. In some ways it is an expert interview post as Jessie
   Gallan has turned 109, but it is also a fun and happy post
   celebrating long life.
   huff-post-old


   Jessie puts her long life down to walking, a bowl of porridge each
   morning, but primarily to avoiding men. However, this may not be the
   only answer to a long life, as we shall see with our next example
   below.

   Viral elements: Share the secret of eternal life. Or if that’s too much
   of a stretch, share heartwarming content about longevity. In a way this
   is a variation on how-to health posts.

14) Share A Heart Warming Story

   People love stories and they love to share heart warming stories.

   Example: Husband 108, Wife 105, Celebrate 82 Years Married (580,000
   shares)

   USA Today’s top post this year was a heart warming story of a long and
   happy marriage. Maybe the moral for men who want to live a long time is
   to be married.
   usa-old-post usa-list
   This post topped USA Today’s most shared content because it was a
   heartwarming, happy, inspirational story. It may also have some
   insights for long life as the couple describes their healthy breakfast
   of tea, oatmeal and fresh fruit. They also nap early and often.

   Viral elements: This post contained a happy story of a long marriage
   and possibly the secrets of a long life.

Conclusions: Four Elements of Shareable Content

   Ok, so what have we learnt from the most shared content this year? More
   importantly can it help us in creating shareable content?

   It is worth starting by reiterating that there is no formula for going
   viral. It’s not always clear what will ignite a post and provoke
   significant sharing. Even the big sites have random outliers, posts
   that generate share counts no one could have predicted. The evidence
   also suggests it is not simply about the content but also about
   amplification. In our research sharing by just 5 influencers can be
   enough to ignite content sharing. Paid amplification can also help kick
   start things if you have a potential viral post.

   What we can see from the posts above is that they often combine
   different elements to make the content more shareable. For example:
     * A quiz on a popular topic leverages both a trend and a shareable
       content format.
     * A picture list post combines three very shareable elements namely a
       list, curation and images.

   From our analysis there are four different elements that contribute to
   shareability as follows.

   viral-elements

   This is not a comprehensive list, just a way of thinking about the
   elements. A viral post is likely to combine a number of these elements.
   Nothing guarantees your content will go viral but including one or more
   of these elements can help make your content more shareable. Thus when
   creating content you can ask yourself:
     * Does the content have an emotional element?
     * Does the post include shareable content types, such as facts,
       images, and quotes?
     * Is the topic one that resonates with your audience? Is it trending?
     * Is the format one that works well with your audience, such as
       practical tips or a quiz?

   Headline

   Finally, a potential viral or shareable post also needs a good
   headline. I really like the way BuzzFeed create multiple headlines and
   A/B test them with audiences. This allows them to tailor based on real
   audience interaction. However, you may not have this facility.  If not,
   you can look at the four elements above and think above incorporating
   these into your headline. For example:
     * Emotional words e.g. Surprising
     * Topic e.g. Zombies
     * Type e.g. Facts
     * Format e.g. List post

   Thus a simple headline using all four elements may be “10 surprising
   facts about Zombies”. Ok, so you can’t just write by numbers like this,
   but it’s a good way to check that your headline will have shareability.

   Can you go viral in 2016?

   No promises but..

   .. by learning the lessons from this year’s viral content we may be
   able to make our content more shareable in 2016.

   Let us know how you get on. Good luck!
   How

   Published November 23^rd 2015

Be Inspired: The Best B2B Content Of 2015

   Ok, we are calling it early but here are our views on some of the best
   B2B content of 2015. We collaborated with our frends at Uberflip to
   review and highlight the top B2B content that has inspired us this
   year. We have included 20 examples from eBooks and research reports
   through to “how to” posts and product launches.

   Hopefully these examples will be an inspiration for your content
   strategy in 2016. What did we miss? Share the B2B content that inspired
   you this year and which should be included in our hall of fame.

   Identifying the top or best content is clearly a subjective task. Also
   what is meant by “best content”? Was it the content that drove the most
   awareness, the most engagement or the most traffic? Or the content that
   generated the best leads and most conversions? In reality different
   content has different objectives and typically a piece
   of content will support one or two parts of the sales funnel as we can
   see below.
   content-funnel

   We have looked across the sales funnel and identified examples of
   inspiring highly shared content from some of the leading B2B companies.
   Our examples include:
     * Research Content
     * eBooks and Guides
     * Updated Reference Content
     * Trending & Hashtag/News Jacking Content
     * ‘How to’ and Practical Content
     * Provocative Content
     * Curated and list content
     * Quizzes
     * Product Launch Content
     * Tools
     * Infographics
     * Case Studies

Research Content

   Most B2B audiences are interested in findings from new research and how
   it may affect what they do. It’s a great way to provide insights and
   value without coming across like you’re pushing your product too hard.
   Research white papers have long been a staple of B2B marketing content.
   The team at Buffer do a fantastic job on their blog and this year their
   most shared post was a research survey.
   buffer-top buffer-research


   Research surveys conducted regularly can become very powerful pieces of
   content. A great example of a regular research report is Mary Meeker’s
   annual Internet Trends Report. This report covers a wide range of
   research on trends from mobile access to local services. The research
   has become established almost as part of the annual calendar. This year
   Mary’s slides had over 13,000 shares and more importantly over 2.7m
   views at the time of writing. The slides make it easy to scan the key
   findings – how it’s presented is a key driver of the high shares.
   internet-trends-list internet-trends


   Another good example is the Content Marketing Institute, who are
   carving out a niche with their regular content marketing research
   including their latest on Effective B2B Content Marketing.

   You can also comment and share third party research. For example,
   Business Insider shared and commented on a slide deck about the future
   of tech and media from a former Yahoo Board Exec which was presented at
   the Wall Street Journal Digital Live Conference. This was popular with
   LinkedIn members and shared over 3,500 times on LinkedIn. We have
   generally found that research and trends content works well on
   LinkedIn.
   binsider

   Reflection: What research do you have access to or can you undertake
   that would be of value to your audience in 2016?

Regularly Updated Reference Content

   In our view every site needs cornerstone content, something that
   distinguishes your site, which is comprehensive and authoritative.
   Something that people know you for, link to and return to read again
   and again. Mary Meeker’s annual report is a great example. However,
   there are other forms of reference content that can work equally as
   well as research surveys. These include comprehensive guides or
   reviews.

   One of the best examples of this in our view is Moz’s ‘Web Developer’s
   SEO Cheat Sheet‘. Started back in 2008 it has become a core piece of
   reference content. This year’s latest update was the most shared
   content on the Moz site by some margin as we can see below.
   moz-list moz-cheat-sheet

   Another good example is Top Rank’s Social Media Marketing Management
   Tools List. This content is effectively evergreen because it is updated
   and refreshed. This content outperfoms other content on the Top Rank
   blog by a significant margin. Another good example is Ian Cleary’s
   Social Media Monitoring Tools Reference Guide.
   top-rank top-rank-post

   Reflection: What reference content do you or can you provide on an
   annual basis which would be of value to your audience – a tools list,
   cheat sheet, round up of best practices? It takes time to build an
   annual cycle but the rewards are significant as they also build over
   time. Why not start in 2016?

eBooks and Guides

   Long form Guides and eBooks are another staple of B2B marketing. This
   year we were taken by Intercom’s open approach to sharing what they
   have learnt in a number of eBooks. Two of Intercom’s top 5 most shared
   posts this year were their eBooks. The top one which we read avidly was
   on Customer Engagement.
   intercom-list intercom-ebook

   We also really enjoyed LinkedIn’s ‘Sophisticated Marketer’s Guide to
   LinkedIn‘. As well as having a great visual design, the guide
   incorporated the views of leading marketing experts, building in a
   degree of influencer amplification from the start.
   linkedin


   Reflection: What have you learnt and what unique expertise do you have
   that can be turned into a helpful guide or ebook? Can you combine
   several posts into a longer-form piece?

Trending Content and News Jacking

   At the opposite end of the spectrum from reference and evergreen
   content is trending content. This is content that is designed to take
   advantage of a specific trending topic or issue. The long term impact
   and life of this content may not be as great as evergreen reference
   content but it can help position your brand as being on top of trends
   and drive significant traffic. There were a number of examples this
   year which caught our eye.

   The first was Deloitte, not a company you might immediately think of in
   terms of news jacking. However, in June it published an article in
   support of marriage equality when the issue was at its height in the
   news and the company also used a trending hashtag #marriageequality in
   its promotion. This article is currently the most shared on the
   Deloitte site this year as we can see below.
   deloitte deloitte-post

   Another example of this is Intel, which engaged in a hashtag campaign
   #ILookLikeAnEngineer. They published a post on 8 Intel Engineers
   Breaking the Mold and this became the most shared piece of content on
   their site this year.
   intel-list intel-post

   The BuzzSumo count in the image is from our new Chrome extension which
   allows you to continue to see Twitter shares now that the share count
   button has been deprecated. You can download it from the Chrome store.

   Reflection: Are you monitoring trending issues and are you able to
   engage quickly? Internet trends can be very short lived and you can
   look out of touch if you engage late in the trend. Thus there are
   dangers but also upside, as we can see from the most shared posts on
   Intel and Deloitte this year.

‘How To’ Content

   Most people want to do their job better and faster. Thus I think there
   is a unique place for ‘how to’ content in B2B marketing. This content
   can be helpful and have real value such as tips or guides. The best
   ‘how to’ posts are well structured, almost educational, with clear
   steps and images. See our previous article on the perfect ‘how to’
   post.

   Here are two great examples from Buffer, which were their fourth and
   fifth most shared posts this year.
   buffer-how-to

   Both posts are really well structured and practical. They also address
   issues which the audience is struggling with. Good ‘how to’ posts have
   a series of clear steps, with clarifying images and links to further
   reading. Below is an excerpt from Peg Fitzpatrick’s post on How to
   Scale Your Social Media Strategies for Growth. This is simply a great
   example of how to do a “how to” post.
   how-to-peg

   QuickSprout and Neil Patel have built an audience based on providing
   practical advice and tips which are helpful to their audience. Here are
   their top posts this year. Note their top post on the best times to
   post on Social Media is very similar to the top post on Buffer this
   year.
   neil-patel

   Reflection: What questions are your audience asking, what issues are
   they struggling with? Can you develop a practical ‘how to’ post using
   your unique knowledge and skills? How can you “Be the best answer” to a
   burning question?

Curated Content and Lists

   We are reluctant sometimes to highlight how well list posts work, as
   we’re all drowning in them, but there is little question they work well
   whether in B2B or B2C marketing. They work particuarly well as a format
   for curated content. The late Cindy King of Social Media Examiner was
   simply the very best at creating curated list posts. Her post on 44
   Social Media Tools Recommended By The Pros is currently the most shared
   on the Social Media Examiner site this year.
   sme-list sme-post

   Michael Brenner also creates curated posts that provide value to his
   audience and saves them time by doing research on their behalf.
   Michael’s top two posts this year are curated posts. His top post,
   which is worth reading if you haven’t already, is on the Top 20 Content
   Marketing Blogs.
   b2b-insider

   Reflection: Where can you help your audience and save them time by
   curating content into a list post?

Provocative Content

   You know the headline works. Headlines are more important than ever to
   attract attention and pull you in. The Next Web do a great job with
   their headlines, making them provocative and interesting. Their most
   shared post this year was on the death of Flash.
   tnw-top


   flash-dead

   Their third most shared post was also provocative on the correlation
   between gamers and the use of Porn sites “Pornhub saw a 10% drop in
   traffic when Fallout was released.”

   Being provocative by challenging an established orthodoxy can also gain
   attention. Intercom’s most shared post this year challenged the notion
   of “mobile first”.
   mobile-first-list mobile-first

   Reflection: Can you challenge an existing orthodoxy or come up with a
   provocative viewpoint? There are risks so you need to be careful, but
   controversy attracts attention.

Product Launch

   Of course there comes a time in B2B marketing where you need to talk
   about your own stuff. How do you do this without reverting to old style
   interruption marketing or brochure-speak? We were impressed with the
   launch of IBM’s Watson Analytics product, technically the beta was
   launched in late 2014. It is difficult to know how much paid promotion
   was put behind the launch but the product content and the free version
   generated a lot of coverage. The product leveraged an existing trend
   and interest in Big Data. The launch was also accompanied by an
   influencer strategy. Various people were approached to try the tool via
   social networks. This created interest, discussion and social sharing,
   I came across the tool this way. The product launch page was by far the
   most shared content on the IBM site this year.
   ibm-list ibm

   Timing is often everything. Taking advantage or leveraging trends can
   work very well. On a much smaller scale we started developing our
   Chrome Extension to show Twitter shares as soon as we heard Twitter
   were retiring their share count. We were then able to launch the
   toolbar last week so that is was available when people started looking
   for a solution to see Twitter shares.

   Reflection: Are you launching a key product in 2016? How can sharing
   across on social networks help you to spread the word?

Quizzes

   Who can resist a quizz? Quizzes can be a great way to drive awareness
   and create a lighter form of content. Sites like BuzzFeed, PlayBuzz and
   Disney have driven millions of shares of quizzes such as ‘Which Disney
   Princess Are You?’ In the B2B world we have few princesses (maybe a few
   divas) but people still enjoy a quiz, and particularly love quizzes
   about themselves. As the Qzzr guys say, it’s like walking past a
   mirror, you can’t resist. One of the quizzes that caught our eye this
   year was one from InfusionSoft on What Kind of Entreprenuer Are You?
   infusionsoft-quiz

   Reflection: What quizzes might interest your audience? You can build
   them simply and quickly with tools such as Qzzr.

Tools

   Tools can be great at driving traffic and awareness, and in some ways
   can work a little like quizzes or assessments. Hubspot have done very
   well with their Website Grader and this year LinkedIn excelled with
   their Social Selling Index. This tool calculates your social selling
   skills and scores you on a number of indices. The tool was one of the
   most shared pieces of content on the LinkedIn business site this year.
   linkedin-list social-selling


Infographics

   Infographics continue to get highly shared when used in the right
   context. There were many good examples this year. I thought
   Canva’s Complete Social Media Image Size Guide: With Awesome Design
   Tips was a great example of using an infographic as a reference guide.
   It became one of their most shared posts this year.
   info3

   Other good examples included Larry Kim’s 24 Daily Habits To Boost Your
   Intelligence and Entrpreneur’s 15 Ways to Get Stuff Done. (The latter
   was technically December 2014). Both of these were simple ways to
   quickly review your own practices against some recommended best
   practices.
   info1


   infographic

Case Studies

   This was an area which disappointed this year. Case studies offer a
   great opportunity to tell stories that are unique and to show how you
   company is adding value to customers. Despite this we found few
   companies doing case studies well and feel this is an opportunity for
   B2B companies.

   The {Grow} blog did recognise the power of case studies and published a
   well curated set of 33 B2B digital marketing case studies this year.
   This article was the most shared post on the {Grow} blog this year.
   grow-list grow

   I personally like what Hubspot do with their customer case study
   videos, for example this Shopify Case Study published in September
   2015. The format works really well in my view. For example, having a
   real customer tell the story, good use of overlay graphics and high
   quality production values. That said, these case studies get relatively
   low shares and views. Why is this? Is it because case studies are
   niche, because people are less keen on B2B video? I think there is a
   lot more we can learn about case studies as I remain convinced this is
   an area of opportunity for B2B companies.

What Did we Miss?

   Ok, we must have missed a lot of great B2B content this year. Let us
   know what content you would add to our list.

5 Steps to Scrutinising Your Competitors’ Content

   Competitor analysis can be a time consuming task – making it easy to
   push back on the to-do list – but it’s crucial for keeping ahead in an
   increasingly overcrowded content market.

   By following the steps below you can ensure you’re aware of what your
   competitors are up to and how you can outperform them.

1.     Identify your competitors

   You should already know who your key competitors are, but chances are
   there are some you’re unaware of.
   competitors

   By identifying your direct, indirect and ‘available spend’ competitors
   (also called perceived or replacement), you’ll have an extensive list –
   outside of the known competition – to focus on.

   Direct competitors offer very similar products and services. You will
   probably know most of these.

   Indirect competitors may offer similar products and services within a
   wider offer. These can often be found by doing keyword analysis and
   seeing who also appears on terms you are ranking for.

   Perceived or replacement competitors may not offer similar products or
   even be in the same industry but they may offer products that can
   become perceived as replacements. Social listening and customer surveys
   can help you understand your audience and detect these competitors.

   Few of us have time to carry out thorough analysis of 20+ sites, so
   narrow this list down to between three to five; incorporating a mix of
   the types above.

   By doing this, you’ll be on your way to gaining a rounded view of the
   industry offering products and services similar to yours.

2.     Check out their onsite SEO

   From load speed and H1 tags, to relevant on-page content, there are
   various ways you can gauge the success of your competitor’s onsite SEO.

   AccuRanker’s competitor benchmarking guide outlines 12 questions to ask
   when analysing onsite SEO of your competitors. Things to look out for
   include whether your competitors are using internal linking, length of
   content, related keywords and how SEO friendly their URLs are.

   The guide also comes with a free, downloadable checklist, helping to
   speed up your analysis process.
   onsite seo

3.     Examine their on-page content

   Having relevant, informative and engaging content not only allows a
   site to become a valuable resource, but including more content helps
   with rankings.

   Try a couple of searches to see where the competition are appearing. If
   any seem to be ranking consistently high, check out their content to
   see what they’re doing and how you could exceed their efforts.

   Writing reams of uninteresting text just to hit a word count isn’t
   wise, especially if this ends up equating to duplicate content (you can
   check for this with a tool like OnCrawl). But if your competitors offer
   valuable information about a product or service, and are including the
   relevant keywords early on in the content, it will be working in their
   favour.

   Using multi-media on the page is even better. This helps to illustrate
   information in more detail, as well as engage users, encouraging them
   to spend more time on site and reducing bounce rates.
   image2

   After you’ve scrutinised what the competition are doing, have a look at
   your own site too. Could you add additional informative content? Do you
   have video or audio content that could be added to pages to improve
   engagement?

   If so, don’t hesitate in adding these improvements to your priority
   list.

4.     Investigate bigger content pieces

   From their blog posts to larger campaigns, like infographics,
   interactive pieces and eBooks, your best competitors will be producing
   content that is being shared and linked to.

   With Buzzsumo you can analyse your competitors’ domains to find their
   most socially shared content. This means, rather than trawl their site
   for pieces you think may have performed well, you will know for sure
   which pieces are shareable.
   content analysis

   Narrow down this list to include a variety of content types, including
   blog posts and larger campaigns, before analysing the pieces themselves
   to determine what makes them appealing. This process can help generate
   topic ideas of your own, as well as identify any gaps in the market you
   can tap in to.

   With Buzzsumo’s performance reports, you can compare your competitors
   and reveal who is performing well. You can then set up content alerts
   to monitor frontrunners, so you’ll immediately be made aware of any new
   content they’re uploading.

5.     Find their influencers

   Once you’ve identified your competitors’ best performing pieces of
   content, take a look at who’s supporting it. Those linking to and
   sharing content from your competitors are likely to do the same for
   your pieces too.

   When using Buzzsumo in step four, ensure you also ‘view sharers’ of the
   piece you’re investigating and filter by followers or engagement to
   reveal the most influential people. Export this and you have the
   makings of a prospecting list.
   image3

   Since it’s not purely about how shareable content is, you can also use
   Majestic to input the URL of the content piece you’re focusing on and
   reveal which sites are linking to it.

   Then, add any relevant, quality sites to your prospecting list; chances
   are, they’ll be interested in linking to similar content (yours) in the
   future.

Summary

   The full process of competitor analysis, from identifying those you
   need to monitor, to scrutinising their content, isn’t a job that can be
   completed in minutes. However, set aside the time and the rewards will
   be obvious.

   Analysing competitor progress can help you to see how you’re measuring
   up. In addition, you can use your findings to identify what works – and
   doesn’t – for your audience, identify content gaps you can begin to
   fill, as well as use their influencers to amplify your own content.
