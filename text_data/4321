tail-end of summer Sunday Letter: 09.22.19

   Sunday Letter: 09.22.19

   Dearly beloved, we gather for this Sunday Letter on the last day of
   summer. Can you believe it?

   Here in Arkansas, summer only decided to show itself a few weeks ago.
   And now, at the tail-end of a weird season, during an even crazier
   weather year, here we are. Tomorrow is the first day of fall.

   FALL!!! Yes, I’m a little bit excited. Today, if it’s the only thing I
   do, I will mark the changing seasons by swapping out my front door
   wreath for something more autumnal. If you change your front door
   wreath, the cooler weather will come… It’s true.

   I had a busy week, didn’t get enough accomplished in the area of
   writing, but absorbed culture in the form of The Goldfinch (loved it!)
   and The Blue Man Group (loved it too!). The Blue Man Group performed
   at Walton Arts Center. It’s always a treat to go there.Continue Reading

   another Sunday Letter

   Good morning. It’s time for another Sunday Letter.

   I’m writing from charming and quirky Eureka Springs, Arkansas. I’ve
   been here for several days, staying at The Writers’ Colony at Dairy
   Hollow, soaking up the peace and quiet while making yet more tweaks on
   my book and tackling a few other projects. If you are a writer or
   artist or musician, I can’t stress enough how important getting away
   from routine can be for your creativity.

   Dirty laundry isn’t a thing at Dairy Hollow.Continue Reading

Vintage Harvest Photos (and the magic therein)

   September 13, 2019 By Talya Tate Boerner 8 Comments

   Vintage Harvest

   As farmers work another harvest, I thought it would be fun to share a
   few vintage harvest photos from our family farm. Something odd to
   me—none of these pictures are dated. There are no dates printed on the
   white borders by Kodak or scribbled on the back in Momma’s handwriting…

   What’s up with that?

   Based on the various photograph styles, I’m guessing these pictures
   span the early 1960s through the mid-1970s.Continue Reading
