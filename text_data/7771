What they say
about us

   ‚ÄúAs the concepts behind cloud computing have moved from an academic
   conversation to an economic reality, it is important to take a
   scientific approach and constantly refine this based on latest advances
   in technology and lessons learnt in the field. Trust-IT, through its
   continued efforts with Cloudscape, are renowned for bringing together
   the interested parties from all technical constituencies to work on
   advancing the common knowledge‚Äù.

Joe Baguley

   Chief Technology Officer, EMEA, VMware

   I personally appreciate Trust-IT's skills at proposing innovative
   solutions with true professionalism, initiating and bringing value-add
   to co-operation between scientists and stakeholder communities.
   GRL2020, GRDI2020 and DL.org are excellent examples of this.

   The SIENA roadmap has made a number of key recommendations on
   e-infrastructure to support research in Europe. It has been a great
   pleasure for me as chair of the roadmap editorial board to work with
   Trust-IT Services, the SIENA expert groups, and the numerous
   individuals who contributed to producing the roadmap document.

   Advances in research are only one side of the coin. Areas that are
   rapidly evolving and topics of general interest need to be
   communicated, broadcast and co-ordinated effectively. BSC has found a
   very professional and active partner in Trust-IT. We are happy to
   embark on new projects and joint initiatives with them.

Rosa Badia

   Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Grid Computing and Clusters Manager

   From our very first meeting, I knew Trust-IT was a savvy SME with an
   international network. This alone makes it an ideal partner. Our work
   together on cloud security and contractual issues not only calls for
   specialised knowledge but also excellent communication skills and
   access to the right audiences. I like the fact Trust-IT has all this
   and more.

   The excellent work of Trust-IT enabled the VENUS-C project to publicise
   its work to the widest and diverse audience possible. Without their
   innovation, ideas and dedication, the project would have not achieved
   the widespread recognition and praise that it did. I look forward to
   future successful collaborations with them.
     * [woodman.jpg?itok=2W5DK7hc]

Dr Simon Woodman

   Newcastle University, UK

   Trust-IT possesses a rich experience in dealing with ICT actors and
   institutions in Europe and Asia. Their range of skills in
   communication, dissemination and organisation of a broad range of
   thematic events have brought critical value to several EU-India
   international cooperation projects in ICT research. Understanding and
   assimilating a new environment or a new topic and getting operational
   with the right human resources and skillset, to my mind, are their core
   strengths.

   Our successful synergy in the European VENUS-C project helped
   demonstrate the simplicity of adopting cloud computing solutions and
   advantages like cost-effectiveness, reliability, flexibility and ease
   of use. I would like to thank Trust-IT for its support in communicating
   results excellently to peers and successfully reaching target
   communities.

   express my gratitude to Trust-IT. The team played a key role in the
   liaison with the user community and the success of the Open Call. The
   highly successful Open Call campaign, which received 60 proposals from
   across Europe, bears testimony to their dedication and professionalism.

   I have found collaborating with Trust-IT to be an enjoyable and highly
   professional experience. Silvana's team have a thorough grasp of the
   complexities of the European Union ICT-related ecosystem and
   initiatives - they demonstrate a policy-driven approach unusual in such
   a small and nimble company. They are passionate about what they do, and
   have a knack of identifying and seeding discussion about future market
   trends within their extensive transatlantic network.

   Having Trust-IT by our side has been extremely valuable: they have done

   on-line tools to help our large consortium work together.

Lilli Freda

   EPOS-IP Project Director, Researcher at INGV

   I have collaborated with Trust-IT in five EC FP7 and H2020 projects,
   all of which they have co-ordinated. These projects have been well
   organized and even though they were complex in terms of numbers of
   partners, deliverables and milestones I felt that with the leadership
   Trust-IT showed the project was always being steered to a successful
   conclusion. I wouldn't hesitate in joining a consortium they are
   leading and on a number of occasions have given my personal
   recommendation to colleagues from other departments within Oxford to
   join projects Trust-IT were leading. Overall working with Silvana and
   her team is always rewarding and with projects already completed I feel
   we have made a difference in Europe, and in a number of cases globally,
   in a number of ICT related areas providing leadership to a community
   that would not have reached its full potential otherwise.

What they say
about us

   ‚ÄúAs the concepts behind cloud computing have moved from an academic
   conversation to an economic reality, it is important to take a
   scientific approach and constantly refine this based on latest advances
   in technology and lessons learnt in the field. Trust-IT, through its
   continued efforts with Cloudscape, are renowned for bringing together
   the interested parties from all technical constituencies to work on
   advancing the common knowledge‚Äù.

   I personally appreciate Trust-IT's skills at proposing innovative
   solutions with true professionalism, initiating and bringing value-add
   to co-operation between scientists and stakeholder communities.
   GRL2020, GRDI2020 and DL.org are excellent examples of this.

   The SIENA roadmap has made a number of key recommendations on

   pleasure for me as chair of the roadmap editorial board to work with

   Advances in research are only one side of the coin. Areas that are

   communicated, broadcast and co-ordinated effectively. BSC has found a
   very professional and active partner in Trust-IT. We are happy to
   embark on new projects and joint initiatives with them.

   From our very first meeting, I knew Trust-IT was a savvy SME with an
   international network. This alone makes it an ideal partner. Our work
   together on cloud security and contractual issues not only calls for
   specialised knowledge but also excellent communication skills and
   access to the right audiences. I like the fact Trust-IT has all this
   and more.

   The excellent work of Trust-IT enabled the VENUS-C project to publicise
   its work to the widest and diverse audience possible. Without their
   innovation, ideas and dedication, the project would have not achieved
   the widespread recognition and praise that it did. I look forward to
   future successful collaborations with them.

Dr Simon Woodman

   Newcastle University, UK

   Trust-IT possesses a rich experience in dealing with ICT actors and
   institutions in Europe and Asia. Their range of skills in
   communication, dissemination and organisation of a broad range of
   thematic events have brought critical value to several EU-India
   international cooperation projects in ICT research. Understanding and
   assimilating a new environment or a new topic and getting operational
   with the right human resources and skillset, to my mind, are their core
   strengths.

   Our successful synergy in the European VENUS-C project helped

   results excellently to peers and successfully reaching target

   I have found collaborating with Trust-IT to be an enjoyable and highly

   complexities of the European Union ICT-related ecosystem and
   initiatives - they demonstrate a policy-driven approach unusual in such
   a small and nimble company. They are passionate about what they do, and
   have a knack of identifying and seeding discussion about future market

Lilli Freda

   I have collaborated with Trust-IT in five EC FP7 and H2020 projects,
   all of which they have co-ordinated. These projects have been well
   organized and even though they were complex in terms of numbers of
   partners, deliverables and milestones I felt that with the leadership
   Trust-IT showed the project was always being steered to a successful
   conclusion. I wouldn't hesitate in joining a consortium they are
   leading and on a number of occasions have given my personal
   recommendation to colleagues from other departments within Oxford to
   join projects Trust-IT were leading. Overall working with Silvana and
   her team is always rewarding and with projects already completed I feel
   we have made a difference in Europe, and in a number of cases globally,
   in a number of ICT related areas providing leadership to a community
   that would not have reached its full potential otherwise.
