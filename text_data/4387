   A palestinian woman walks behind an olive tree allegedly cut by evil
   Zionist settlers.

     A Palestinian woman walks behind a partly cut olive tree in the
     northern West Bank village of Burin, Thursday, Jan. , 7, 2010.
     According to Burin’s mayor, Jewish settlers cut more than 20 olive
     trees in the village in protest against the Israeli army’s recent
     evacuation of an unauthorized settlement outpost in the area. (AP

   All of a sudden, in a spontaneous outpouring of emotion, the
   palestinian woman cries out.

   Lucky our intrepid AP photographer just happens to be there.

   Right in front of the woman.

   All that’s missing is a toy.

   Following on from Brian’s previous post, here is an alternative
   response to the St James Church “Wall,” written by Kay Wilson, who two
   years ago was brutally stabbed by palestinians in an attack that killed
   her friend, Kristine Luken.

     An open letter from Kay Wilson to St James Church, Piccadilly,
     England

     A true story…..

     “And it came to pass that in December 2010, two Palestinian
     shepherds left their little town near Bethlehem and set out to walk
     ten miles across the Judean Hills. There in the forest, they kept
     watch by night. The following day, at about the 6th hour (3pm) the
     shepherds saw two women walking along the Israel National Trail.
     With great fervour they took out their knives and attacked the
     women.

     While shepherds held the girls that day and pinned them to the
     ground, their serrated blades glinted in the sun, shining all
     around. With knives to their throats, the women dare not move.
     ‘Fear not,’ said the men – for mighty dread had seized the women’s
     troubled minds – ‘we bring you good news that will cause great joy
     for our people.’ What could these glad tidings be? Rape, a robbery,
     a beating? Anything was better than death the women pondered in
     their hearts.

     And it came to pass that near the seventh hour, the shepherds said,
     ‘behold’, let us go forth and kill these Jews like Allah has told us
     to do.’

     The shepherds gagged the women, removed their shoes and bound their
     hands. They forced one woman to her knees, covered her head and
     pushed her neck forward. The woman knelt, and prepared herself to be
     beheaded. Suddenly she saw a great light – the blade of his knife
     glinting in the sun. The Jewish woman whispered, ‘Hear Oh Israel.’
     The Islamic host cried, ‘Allah HuAkbar,’ and the Christian screamed
     “Jesus,” the name of a Jew born in David’s town.

     Thirteen times the shepherds thrust their knives into the women,
     breaking bones, tearing flesh, even impaling one to the ground. As
     the Jew played dead, she watched the Christian friend hacked to
     death before her very eyes.

     The shepherds returned home glorifying and praising Allah for all
     that they had seen and spread the word concerning what had they had
     done. ‘Today near the town of David two Jews have been slaughtered,’
     they declared. They plotted and schemed, boasting to their
     neighbours, ‘this will be a sign, they will find two of their own,
     all meanly wrapped in bloody clothes and in the bushes laid.’ And
     everyone who heard of it, was amazed.”

     I have given much thought to the events of that terrible day, that
     culminated in my near murder and the execution of my friend. I
     believe that I of all people could be forgiven for hating
     Palestinians. I believe too that I could be forgiven for thinking
     all Palestinians are terrorists. I do not. On the contrary I have
     maintained relationships with my Palestinian friends, so that my
     ignorance will not give me reason to hate. I hate hatred. It is your
     hatred, in the form of a Christmas stunt, that has compelled me to
     write.

     I would like to think that as Christians, you would never condone
     Kristine Luken’s heinous murder or the attack on myself. I suspect
     however that you may rationalise this savagery as an inevitable
     result of the “Israeli occupation.”

     You would probably suggest that the Palestinians who murdered my
     friend were themselves victims who grew up in depravity. I would
     concur but would point out that if poverty was the case, the
     aristocrats who flew into the twin towers had no reason to commit
     their crimes.

     The Palestinian terrorists were indeed victims, victims of a radical
     and primitive Islamic regime that force feeds them a morally
     malnourished diet of hatred of Jews and hatred of any life –
     including their own. They were also deprived: deprived of an
     education that cherishes culture, history, literature, art and the
     dignity of difference. Their impoverished morality coupled with
     ignorant generalisations is what enabled two men to butcher
     defenceless women without so much as blinking an eye.

     Your “wall” that you have erected outside your church, is hopefully
     just a result of your own ignorance and generalisations concerning
     the complex situation here in the Middle East. Nevertheless, like
     all walls, it serves as a facade and a barrier.

     If your wall was scrutinised, one would see that underneath the
     whitewashed surface that concerns itself with Israeli policies,
     there are blocks of anti-Semitism. These bricks stand high. They
     raise expectations from an entire people group. This wall precedes
     to separate the nation of Israel as non-desirable.

     Your wall is cemented together by a superior theology that tells
     it’s people that G-d gave up on the Jews. This is the same theology
     that lies behind radical Islam. G-d tried the Jews, then the
     Christians but ultimately it was the Muslims who He ultimately
     chose.

     Your wall, is just one brick in a global wall of an Islamic agenda,
     an agenda that will stop at nothing until the destruction of the
     Jewish State. To your own cultural detriment, it is a wall that
     obstructs truth and ultimately seeks not only to destroy Israel but
     every Judeo-Christian society.

     Your wall inflames an ancient conflict that for those like myself,
     who live in this region, long not for an exacerbation in hatred but
     for a quenching of hostilities.

     Your wall is an affront to Kristine Luken and other victims of
     terror who may well have been alive today had there have been a wall
     erected on the other 90% of land that separates us from our
     Palestinian neighbours.

     Your wall is an injustice to Christians living under Muslim
     despotism. Ironically it is the State of Israel, that you deem
     pariah and unjust, that is unique in the Middle East because unlike
     all of our neighbours, our Christian population is flourishing and
     our Christians have full religious rights.

     Please write on your wall, under the cross, now obscured by the
     crescent…. “R.I.P Kristine Luken.”

     Sincerely

     Kay Wilson

   Update: Kay has indicated she would be willing to fly to London at very
   short notice and present her letter to St James Church in Piccadilly.
   She would also like to write the name of her murdered friend on their
   replica wall.

   Please share this if you think it can reach someone with the finances
   and will to make this happen very quickly.

   It seems like the problem with commenting on Israellycool was caused by
   some code I had inserted for something called Viralogy, a Social Media
   Ranking site. I had actually inserted the code all the way back in
   August, and forgotten about it.

   Now I expect great things from all of you after a period of talking to
   myself.
