Summary Report 2018

   7. February 2019
     * AVC-News

   AV-Comparatives’ Summary Report 2018 is now available
   for download (PDF). Every year, we give awards for the best-scoring IT
   security products in our Consumer Main Test Series. Find out which
   antivirus products received Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards, and which
   vendor won the Product of the Year award:
   https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/summary-report-2018/

   AV-Comparatives Consumer 2018 Main Test Series
   In 2018, we subjected 18 security products for Windows to rigorous
   testing. These systematic tests help antivirus vendors to find errors
   in their programs, and improve the protection they offer. Our lab
   evaluated all programs regarding their ability to protect against
   real-world Internet threats, identify thousands of recent malicious
   programs, provide protection without slowing down the PC, and remove
   malware that had already infected a PC.

   Results and awards for individual tests
   All programs tested in 2018 reached acceptable levels of protection and
   performance. Nine security products won an award for one or more of the
   five categories (test types) of the Consumer Main Test Series:
   Real-World Protection, Malware Protection, Performance, Malware
   Removal, and False Positives. For each category, Gold, Silver and
   Bronze awards are given, for the first, second and third
   highest-scoring products, respectively.

   AV-Comparatives 2018 Product of the Year award
   The Product of the Year award (1^st place overall) is given to the
   vendor whose product achieves the highest overall score across all
   categories.

   Outstanding Product award
   This year, two products achieved identical overall scores in the
   Consumer Main Test Series. As in previous years, the product that has
   already won Product of the Year more times/more recently is given the
   Outstanding Product award to highlight its excellent results in the
   2018 tests.

   Top Rated award
   In addition to the two top-scoring products, several vendors achieved
   very good results across different test categories. To highlight their
   consistent performance, we are once again giving these vendors the Top
   Rated Product award. Results from all the tests are assigned points as
   follows: Tested = 0, Standard = 5, Advanced = 10, Advanced+ = 15.
   Products with 90 points or more are given the Top Rated award. In 2018,
   four antivirus solutions qualified for this award.

   The 2018 Summary Report is available for download on our website.

Introduction

   AV-Comparatives is an independent test lab, providing rigorous testing
   of security software products. We were founded in 2004 and are based in
   Innsbruck, Austria.

   AV-Comparatives is an ISO 9001:2015 certified organisation (renewed and
   upgraded in 2016). We received the TÜV Austria certificate for our
   management system for the scope: “Independent Tests of Anti-Virus
   Software”.

   http://www.av-comparatives.org/about-us/certifications/
   AV-Comparatives is the first certified EICAR Trusted IT-Security Lab
   http://www.av-comparatives.org/about-us/certifications/

   At the end of every year, AV-Comparatives releases a summary report to
   comment on the various anti-virus products tested over the year, and to
   highlight the high-scoring products of the various tests that took
   place over the course of the year. Please bear in mind that this report
   considers all the main-series tests of 2017, i.e. not just the latest
   ones. Comments and conclusions are based on the results shown in the
   various comparative test reports, as well as from observations made
   during the tests (http://www.av-comparatives.org/test-methods/).

Tested Products

   The following vendors participated in AV-Comparatives’ Public Main
   Test-Series of 2017 and agreed to have the effectiveness of their
   products independently evaluated.

   We are happy that this year’s tests helped several vendors to find
   critical and other bugs in their software, and that this has
   contributed to improving the products.

   Approved Windows Security Products.

   APPROVED

Management Summary

Tests

   In 2017, AV-Comparatives subjected 21 security products for Windows to
   rigorous investigation. All the programs were tested for their ability
   to protect against real-world Internet threats, identify thousands of
   recent malicious programs, provide protection without slowing down the
   PC, and remove malware that had already infected a PC.

Results and Awards

   Whilst all of the programs in our test reached an acceptable level
   overall, some programs outperformed others. For details, please see
   “Overview of levels reached during 2017” on page 6. In order to
   recognise those products that achieve outstanding scores in our tests,
   we have given a number of end-of-year awards that highlight the best
   results in each test and overall. The Product of the Year, Outstanding
   Product and Top Rated awards are based on overall performance in the
   Public Main Test Series; there are also Gold, Silver and Bronze awards
   for each individual test type. Please see the Award Winners section for
   more details of the awards. The 2017 Product of the Year Award goes to
   Bitdefender; the Outstanding Product Award goes to Kaspersky Lab; Top
   Rated Products are (alphabetically) Avast, AVG, AVIRA, eScan, Tencent
   and VIPRE.

Overview of tested products

   Here we provide a summary for each of the programs tested, with a note
   of each one’s successes during the year. Although the user interface
   does not affect any awards, we have noted some of the best UI features
   as well.

   Adaware receives a joint Bronze Award for the False Positives Test. The
   program interface stands out for its clear, well-thought-out design.

   Avast is a Top Rated Product for 2017, and received five Advanced+
   awards in this year’s tests. It won a joint Bronze Award for the
   Real-World Protection Test. We liked its clear, informative alerts.

   AVG scored Advanced+ in five of this year’s tests, and is a Top Rated
   Product. It receives the joint Bronze Award for the Real-World
   Protection Test.

   Avira is a Top Rated Product this year, having received five Advanced+
   Awards. It takes the joint Silver Award for the Real-World Protection
   Test. We liked the all-new program interface, which is as easy to use
   with a touchscreen as with keyboard and mouse.

   Bitdefender wins this year’s Product of the Year Award, scoring
   Advanced+ in all 7 tests. It additionally receives the Gold Award for
   the Real-World Protection Test (jointly), Silver for the Malware
   Protection Test and Removal Test, and Bronze for the Performance Test.
   We liked the guided tour of the program, which is displayed when you
   first start the software after installation.

   BullGuard takes a joint Gold Award for the Malware Protection Test. Its
   tiled interface provides a clear overview of the various components.

   CrowdStrike received 4 Advanced awards in this year’s tests. Its web
   interface allows administrators to analyse threats in a company
   network.

   Emsisoft reached Advanced or Advanced+ levels in six of this year’s
   tests. Its neat tiled user interface makes a wealth of functionality
   available from the program’s home page.

   eScan is a Top Rated Product this year, with 5 Advanced+ scores in the
   tests. It also receives the Silver Award for the False Positives Test,
   and joint Bronze for the Malware Protection Test. Its tiled interface
   makes it easy to find and configure individual components.

   ESET takes the Gold Award for both Performance and False Positive
   Tests. We found it very easy to use, thanks to an excellent user
   interface and a self-configuring firewall.

   Fortinet took four Advanced awards in this year’s tests, and has a very
   straightforward user interface.

   F-Secure scored at least Advanced in all seven tests this year. The
   setup wizard makes it easy for parents to configure a device for their
   children’s use.

   Kaspersky Lab receives the Outstanding Product of 2017 Award, having
   reached Advanced+ level in all 7 tests. Awards for individual test
   types are joint Gold for the Malware Protection Test, joint Silver for
   the Real-World Protection Test, and Bronze for the Malware Removal
   Test. The “live” tiles of the program interface, which show real-time
   progress of scans and updates, struck us as very useful and innovative.

   McAfee obtained four Advanced+ ratings in this year’s tests. Its tiled
   interface provides a good overview of the features in the program.

   Microsoft’s product is integrated into Windows 10. It receives a joint
   Bronze Award for the False Positives Test.

   Panda takes the joint Gold Award for the Real-World Protection Test. We
   found it very simple to install and use.

   Seqrite takes the Silver Award for the Performance Test. It has clearly
   been designed to be easy to use with a touchscreen as well as mouse and
   keyboard, and makes a wide variety of diagnostic and maintenance tools
   easily accessible.

   Symantec took three Advanced+ ratings in tests this year. It has a very
   modern, touchscreen-friendly interface.

   Tencent (Global English Version) is a Top Rated Product in 2017, having
   obtained five Advanced+ awards in this year’s tests. Awards for
   individual test types are Gold for the Malware Removal Test, and joint
   Silver for the Real-World Protection Test. We liked the clean graphical
   design of its user interface.

   Trend Micro reached Advanced+ in the second Real-World Protection Test
   this year, and has a very neat interface with excellent alerts.

   VIPRE is a Top Rated Product in 2017, having achieved six Advanced+
   awards in this year’s tests. It receives joint Bronze awards for the
   Real-World Protection Test and Malware Protection Test. Its clean,
   well-laid-out interface impressed us.

Advice on Choosing Computer Security Software

   There is no such thing as the perfect security program, or the best one
   for all needs and every user. Being recognized as “Product of the Year”
   does not mean that a program is the “best” in all cases and for
   everyone: it only means that its overall performance in our tests
   throughout the year was consistent and unbeaten.

   Before selecting a security product, please visit the vendor’s website
   and evaluate their software by downloading a trial version. Our awards
   are based on test results only and do not consider other factors, as
   there are some important factors (such as available interface
   languages, price, and support options), which you should evaluate for
   yourself.

Overview of levels reached during 2017

   AV-Comparatives provides a wide range of tests and reviews in
   comprehensive reports
   (http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparatives-reviews/). Annual awards
   for 2017 are based on the Public Main Test-Series: Real-World
   Protection Test, Performance Test, Malware Protection Test, False-Alarm
   Test and Malware Removal Test.

   All the programs tested are from the reputable and reliable
   manufacturers. Please note that even the STANDARD level/award requires
   a program to reach a good standard, although it indicates areas which
   need further improvement compared to other products. ADVANCED indicates
   areas which may need some improvement, but are already very competent.
   Below is an overview of awards reached by the various anti-virus
   products in AV-Comparatives’ consumer main test-series of 2017.
   sum-2017-award-table

Award Winners

Awards for individual tests

   For each of the test types* in the Public Main Test Series (Real-World
   Protection, File Detection, Performance, Malware Removal, and False
   Positives**), we give Gold, Silver and Bronze awards, for the first,
   second and third highest-scoring products, respectively.

Awards for all combined scores of all tests

   As in previous years, in 2017 we are giving our Product of the Year
   Award to the product with the highest overall scores across all of the
   tests in the Public Main Test Series. This depends on the number of
   Advanced+ awards received in all the tests. As all products receiving
   an Advanced+ award are considered (statistically speaking) to be as
   good as each other, a product can receive the Product of the Year award
   without necessarily reaching the highest score in any individual test.

   As in previous years, where there has been a tie for Product of the
   Year, we are using the following tiebreaker: the product that has not
   won the award before, or the product that won it less/least recently,
   is given the award. However, there is very close competition between
   two different products this year, both of which received the Advanced+
   Award in all of the qualifying tests. Consequently, we are again giving
   the Outstanding Product Award to the other product that also achieved
   top scores.

   As in previous years, we will also be giving Top Rated Awards to a
   select group of participating products which reached a very high
   standard in the Public Main Series tests. We have used the results over
   the year to designate products as “Top Rated”. Results from all the
   tests are assigned points as follows: Tested = 0, Standard = 5,
   Advanced = 10, Advanced+ = 15. Products with 90 points or more are
   given the Top Rated award, with two conditions. Firstly, any products
   that failed to win any award (i.e. got 0 points) in either of the
   Real-World Protection tests have not been considered. Secondly, good
   results in the Performance Tests cannot make up for weak results in the
   detection/protection tests.

   least 35 points must be reached.

   *For some test types, there may be two actual tests conducted in a
   year; the awards are based on the combined score of both tests.

   **The False Positives Test is not an independent test, but part of the
   Malware Protection Test.

Real-World Protection Test winners

   Security products include various different features to protect systems
   against malware. Such protection features are taken into account in the
   Real-World Protection Test, which test products under realistic
   Internet usage conditions. Products must provide a high level of
   protection without producing too many false alarms, and without
   requiring the user to make a decision as to whether something is
   harmful or not.

   The programs with the best overall results over the course of the year
   were from: Bitdefender, Panda, Tencent, Kaspersky Lab, Avast, AVG,
   AVIRA and VIPRE.
   GOLD     Bitdefender, Panda
     SILVER Tencent, Avira, Kaspersky Lab
     BRONZE Avast, AVG, VIPRE

Malware Protection winners

   The Malware Protection Test evaluates an AV product’s ability to
   protect against malware coming from removable devices or network
   shares. Products must provide a high level of protection without
   producing too many false alarms. In the Malware Protection Test, all
   samples not detected on-demand or on-access are executed.

   Bitdefender, BullGuard, eScan, Kaspersky Lab and VIPRE earned ADVANCED+
   in both tests.
   GOLD     BullGuard, Kaspersky Lab
     SILVER Bitdefender
     BRONZE eScan, VIPRE

False Positives winners

   False positives can cause as much trouble as a real infection. Due to
   this, it is important that anti-virus products undergo stringent
   quality assurance testing before release to the public, in order to
   avoid false positives. AV-Comparatives carry out extensive
   false-positive testing as part of the Malware Protection Tests. In
   future, false alarms from the Real-World Protection Test may also be
   counted for this category.

   The products with the lowest rates of false positives during 2017 were
   ESET (0), eScan (5) and Adaware, Microsoft (6). These figures represent
   the SUM of the false positives from both FP Tests.
   GOLD     ESET
     SILVER eScan
     BRONZE Adaware, Microsoft

Overall Performance (Low System-Impact) winners

   Security products must remain turned on under all circumstances, while
   users are performing their usual computing tasks. Some products may
   have a higher impact than others on system performance while performing
   some tasks.

   ESET, Seqrite and Bitdefender demonstrated a lower impact on system
   performance than other products.
   GOLD     ESET
     SILVER Seqrite
     BRONZE Bitdefender

Malware Removal winners

   A very useful ability for an anti-virus program is the ability to
   remove malware which has already infected a system.

   In this year’s test, three products received the Advanced+ award and
   scored over 90 points in the Malware Removal Test, these being Tencent,
   Bitdefender and Kaspersky Lab:
   GOLD     Tencent
     SILVER Bitdefender
     BRONZE Kaspersky Lab
