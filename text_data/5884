   session ID cookies (cookies that expire when you close your browser).

   We also use other tracking technologies like web beacons (sometimes
   called “tracking beacons” or “clear gifs”) and local storage. These are
   tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
   recognise when someone has visited our websites or opened an email that
   we have sent them.

Do Not Track

   Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting on our Websites
   that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by
   advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that
   recognizes DNT signals from your web browser.

   We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our
   Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party
   partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information
   about your activities on this Website and other sites in order to
   provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and
   interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the
   purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking
   here (or if located in the European Union, click here). Please note
   this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to
   receive generic ads.

Advertising

   We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display
   advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other
   websites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and web beacons to
   collect information about your activities on our Website and other
   websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
