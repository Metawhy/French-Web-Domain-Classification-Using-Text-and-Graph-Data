About BIS - overview

   Our mission is to serve central banks in their pursuit of monetary and
   financial stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas
   and to act as a bank for central banks.

   Established in 1930, the BIS is owned by 60 central banks, representing
   countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of
   world GDP. Its head office is in Basel, Switzerland and it has two
   representative offices: in Hong Kong SAR and in Mexico City.

   We pursue our mission by:
     * fostering discussion and facilitating collaboration among central
       banks
     * supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for
       promoting financial stability
     * carrying out research and policy analysis on issues of relevance
       for monetary and financial stability
     * acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
       transactions
     * serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international
       financial operations

   As part of our work in the area of monetary and financial stability, we
   regularly publish related analyses and international banking and
   financial statistics that underpin policymaking, academic research and
   public debate.

   With regard to our banking activities, our customers are central banks
   and international organisations. We do not accept deposits from, or
   provide financial services to, private individuals or corporate
   entities.

   Our recently launched medium-term strategy, Innovation BIS
   2025, leverages technology and new collaboration channels to serve the
   central banking community in this fast-changing world.

   In research and analysis, banking services and knowledge-sharing, we
   are continuously innovating to support our stakeholders in the pursuit
   of monetary and financial stability.

About BIS - overview

   Our mission is to serve central banks in their pursuit of monetary and
   financial stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas
   and to act as a bank for central banks.

   Established in 1930, the BIS is owned by 60 central banks, representing
   countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of
   world GDP. Its head office is in Basel, Switzerland and it has two
   representative offices: in Hong Kong SAR and in Mexico City.

   We pursue our mission by:
     * fostering discussion and facilitating collaboration among central
       banks
     * supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for
       promoting financial stability
     * carrying out research and policy analysis on issues of relevance
       for monetary and financial stability
     * acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
       transactions
     * serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international
       financial operations

   As part of our work in the area of monetary and financial stability, we
   regularly publish related analyses and international banking and
   financial statistics that underpin policymaking, academic research and
   public debate.

   With regard to our banking activities, our customers are central banks
   and international organisations. We do not accept deposits from, or
   provide financial services to, private individuals or corporate
   entities.

   Our recently launched medium-term strategy, Innovation BIS
   2025, leverages technology and new collaboration channels to serve the
   central banking community in this fast-changing world.

   In research and analysis, banking services and knowledge-sharing, we
   are continuously innovating to support our stakeholders in the pursuit
   of monetary and financial stability.
