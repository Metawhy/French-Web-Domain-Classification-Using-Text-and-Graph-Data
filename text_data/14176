New research at LeConte Glacier predicts record retreat

   By

   Glaciologists have wrapped up two years of research on LeConte glacier
   near Petersburg. Their preliminary findings show that the glacier could
   reach a record retreat by the end of the year. And it could be an
   indicator for what’s going to happen in Greenland.

   Glaciers are like frozen rivers of ice, constantly moving. LeConte
   Glacier feeds into the ocean near Petersburg at a rate of 90 feet a
   day. LeConte is the southern-most tidewater glacier in the Northern
   Hemisphere. Its accessibility makes it a draw for nearby scientists.
   But that’s not the only reason they’re interested. The glacier is also
   a lot like hundreds of others that cover Greenland.

   collect data on LeConte Glacier seven times over the last two years.

   And Greenland has the attention of climate specialists all over the
   world. When it melts, which they say is inevitable, sea levels could
   rise quickly.

   Christain Kienholz is a Glaciologist at the University of Alaska
   Southeast who is originally from Switzerland. He’s been studying
   LeConte for the past two years to find models to predict glacial melt
   in Greenland.

   “If we want to better understand than we need to look at an example
   like LeConte, which is much better accessible than the glaciers in
   Greenland,” Kienholz said. “LeConte has other advantages because it’s a
   fairly narrow fjord, which allows us to do the measurements from the
   boat like transects fairly efficiently.”

   Kienholz and a colleague have visited LeConte seven times staying at a
   base camp about 1,200 feet above the glacier overlooking the end or
   terminus.

   The research required lots of equipment. They had six time-lapse
   cameras set up around the fjord taking snapshots every fifteen seconds.
   A radar measured the glacier’s speed and elevation every three minutes.
   A sonar measured the depth of the fjord. Seismometers helped detect
   calving events and runoff. And they tracked the weather–the temperature
   and precipitation.

   Some of the research continued year round like the time lapse cameras.
   Kienholz collected over a half a million images through them. The
   winter snow would come and go but the cameras kept rolling.

   “And that’s something that recently became possible,” Kienholz said.
   “We have now cards, memory chips that are large enough to actually
   store that number of pictures. Ten years ago that was not possible.”

   Glacier terminus. (Photo courtesy of Christian Kienholz, University of
   Alaska Southeast)

   Newer computers are helping translate the still images into surface
   speeds of the water.

   Scientists like Kienholz call LeConte and other tidewater glaciers
   non-linear systems. The glaciers are traveling on top of water and
   become stable when they get to shallower spots known as sills. So, the
   terminus usually stays near a shallow spot for a long period of time
   where there is less calving. But when the glacier retreats beyond that
   point onto deeper water, there’s more calving and the terminus jumps
   back.

   “That’s what we have seen with Leconte Glacier,” Kienholz said.
   “Typically it’s stable for a couple of years, a certain spot, typically
   on sill, and then it’s retreating pretty fast for a certain period of
   time and then stable again and then retreating.”

   Students at Petersburg High School have recorded the terminus every
   year for decades and that’s initially what caught scientists attention.
   The new and old information has Kienholz believing that the glacier
   might reach a record retreat this year.

   “We know from maps where the glacier was in 1950, for example, and we
   know from the high school record every year where the glacier terminus
   was, and at the end of this year, very likely the glacier will be as
   far back as never before,” Kienholz said.

   Southeast gathered data at the Leconte Glacier seven times over the

   Kienholz was interested in glaciers early in life growing up in
   Switzerland. He said he has seen major changes just in his lifetime.

   “There are quite a few small glaciers. They were already small when I
   grew up and some of them have gone away,” Kienholz said. “That’s
   definitely what you’re going to see in the years to come. There are a
   lot of glaciers that are predicted to retreat almost completely.”

   Kienholz hopes that his research can help predict just how fast those
   changes will happen and maybe help people plan for what they’re going
   to do about it.

   The two-year research project not only included collecting data from
   the top of LeConte. An oceanography team from Oregon State University
   and University of Oregon has been studying the water near the glacier.
   The two teams are sharing data and plan to publish their results.

   Kienholz hopes that the scientists can secure funding to collect more
   data from LeConte in the future.
