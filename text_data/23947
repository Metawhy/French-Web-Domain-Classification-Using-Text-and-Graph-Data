Statement about the Karman Line

   [cloud-97453_1280.jpg?itok=A1hHhmCs]

   The Karman line is the 100km altitude used by FAI and many other
   organisations to mark the “boundary” of space . In the last few years
   there have been many scientific and technical discussions around this
   demarcation line for the “edge of space” and variance around this as a
   boundary condition for recognition of “astronaut” status.

   Recently published analyses present a compelling scientific case for
   reduction in this altitude from 100km to 80km. These analyses combine
   data/modelling from a number of differing perspectives (latitudinal
   variations during solar cycles, theoretical lift coefficients for
   different size/configuration satellites ranging from cubesats to the
   International Space Station, perigee/apogee elliptical analysis of
   actual satellite orbital lifetimes etc) to a level that has never been
   done before in relation to this issue. They also provide an accurate
   overview of some of the historical arguments and inadvertent
   misrepresentations of Karman’s actual analyses and conclusions from
   over half a century ago.

   FAI has therefore been in contact with the International Astronautical
   Federation (IAF) to propose that an international workshop is held
   during 2019 to fully explore this issue with input and participation
   from the astrodynamics and astronautical community.

   Such a seminar, to be held under joint FAI/IAF auspices, would enable
   discussion from a wide range of professionals with relevant expertise
   to analyse and discuss the issue and possible redefinition of the
   altitude used by international organisations including FAI to recognise
   human spaceflights.

   If the findings lead to a redefinition of the boundary of space as it
   is in use by international organisations, FAI would review any
   performances made between today's statement and the date of
   implementation of the revised definition in order to ensure that these
   performances already take into consideration the findings as they exist
   today.
