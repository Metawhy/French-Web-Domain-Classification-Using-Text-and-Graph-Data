Welcome to Prospect Dark | Halloween Stoop Decor

   It's that time of year again!  Time to open my literal closet full of
   skeletons and decorate for Halloween. Welcome to Prospect Dark!

   Boo!
   [ProspectDark_BrooklynLimestone2019100619.jpg]
   A few months ago, I stumbled upon this old baby pram that started me on
   the idea as a play on our local park, Prospect Park.  Of course our
   version is only for the dead and their leisurely pursuits.

   This park has a mom and dad fussing over baby, a cyclist, a
   graveyard, spooky plants and of course one angry dog.

   [ProspectDark_BrooklynLimestone2019100617.jpg]
   I made the two large tombstones using some scrap wood.  One to honor
   the famous designers of the real Prospect Park and the other to
   reference our planned family costume, The Addams Family. I usually like
   to make the décor match our costume more closely but I made an
   exception this year and just keep the décor in the generally creepy
   category. I think the Addams family would be happy to spend time in
   this park, don't you agree?

Nightstand turned into a Mini Dining Room Sideboard

   Anyone else living in an old home knows it's a constant battle to find
   storage for all of the things we need for modern living that our
   Victorian friends seemed to manage without. Especially now with little
   kids, the storage space we built during our renovation just never seems
   enough.  So when said goodbye to our high chair, that spot seemed like
   the perfect spot for a small sideboard to hold all those little odds
   and ends that you need for diner parties.
   [NighstandBoard.jpg]
   The only problem was that spot on the wall was quite narrow so
   something ready made just did not exist. So instead of a traditional
   sideboard, I had to get creative with what would fit in that spot.
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909151.jpg]
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909152.jpg]
   Off I went to Lowe's, my go to source for all things DIY.  Not
   surprisingly, they are also a great source of storage
   and organizational products (I could spend all day just in that aisle
   alone). They have everything from bins to pegboards to hooks to closet
   systems so I knew they would have a solution.
   Turns out a small chest or in this case, this beautiful Chevron
   nightstand was the perfect fit. (I was really hoping this beautiful
   curved pine chest would fit but alas my wall was too narrow.) Aside
   from being the exact width I needed and visually lovely, it also has
   two built-in USB ports on the back which was a total surprise.  I can
   create a nice charging station right here down the road.
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909159.jpg]
   My first step in turning this nightstand into a dining room storage
   piece was lining each drawer with shelf paper.  I used Duck shelf liner
   in their 'Grey Gate' pattern - one roll was more than enough. Aside
   from just looking a little cuter, the plastic lining helps things stay
   in place when opening and closing the drawers.  Once that was in place
   I turned to my new obsession; bamboo drawer organizers. Specifically I
   used these three sizes: 15x6 , 9x3 and 9x6. They turned this open
   drawer into a custom space for every little small item I use for dinner
   parties including fancy cutlery, cheese markers, votives, napkin rings,
   appetizer knives and a corkscrew.  The stackable nature of these trays
   makes the most of every inch.  It also makes finding these items and
   putting them away a breeze.  The only problem with them is once you get
   a few, you will want to fill every drawer in your house with them. It's
   completely addictive.
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909157.jpg]
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909158.jpg]
   The second drawer I used for my linens and placemats as well as some of
   my favorite wood slice trays. Amazing what can fit into a tiny space
   when well organized. I thought I might need some of these drawer
   dividers (which I'm also obsessed with) but everything fit perfectly
   without me lifting a finger so score!
   And finally I saved the third drawer for appetizer plates and serving
   dishes.  Things I didn't use everyday but wanted to have easy reach
   to.  I could have stuffed this drawer with a lot more but by purging a
   bit, I was able to store my favorites safely and with plenty of space.
   The shelf paper really helps here keeping each little dish in their
   place without any extra effort.

   [NightstandtoSideboard201909156.jpg]
   [NightstandtoSideboard201909154.jpg]
   Even though this chest is relatively small, it has made setting up for
   guests so much easier and has freed up some precious room in my
   cabinets that help me stay organized day to day.

Lisbon With Kids

   Earlier this year we took a short trip to Lisbon, Portugal and totally
   fell in love with the city. It's small yet full of life, charming in
   the most authentic way, has amazing food and drink and is just lovely
   all around.
   [LondonLisbonwithKidsBrooklynLimestone.jpg]
   We had been avoiding Lisbon because of the steep hills and narrow
   sidewalks - both which are not especially stroller friendly - until our
   youngest was old enough to take at least short walks without one. So
   that time had come and off we went.
   Let me start by saying this city is such a visual feast.  There is
   something beautiful to look at everywhere you turn.  It's also highly
   walkable which is a nice bonus on a short trip when you don't really
   want to have to learn the local public transit system.
   One of the best decisions we made on this trip was staying at an
   apartment hotel that had a kid's club.  We weren't sure just how it was
   going to go but it was so wonderful to be able to drop the kids off for
   a few hours and have a nice dinner date or even just a walk around.  I
   found this hotel, the Martinhal Chiado Suites via booking.com and it
   totally made our trip one of the most relaxing we've ever done since
   having kids.  Aside from a spacious apartment in the heart of the city,
   the hotel leaves a few basics for you when you arrive (milk, juice,
   biscuits, etc) and was super flexible and accommodating to our changing
   schedule. Highly recommend this place!
   [LondonLisbon2019042580.jpg]
   Moving on from where we stayed, we spent a lot of time walking the city
   and exploring all of the different neighborhoods both with our feet and
   our mouthes! Lisbon is a city for eating. The seafood alone! We ate at
   several great restaurants but the food tour we took (booked a bit
   randomly at the last minute via tripadvisor) was completely fabulous.
   If you are going to Lisbon book with Treasures of Lisboa and you can
   thank me later. The guide is the owner and we really enjoyed the food
   and the company. We didn't take the kids (thank you again kids' club)
   but we totally could have as it was family friendly. Some of the other
   food related highlights were the Time Out Market (about 5 minutes away
   from our hotel), Taberna da Rua das Flores (a block from the hotel) and
   A Cevicheria. Although I think I would be hard pressed to have a bad
   meal in Lisbon.

   [LondonLisbon20190425101.jpg] [LondonLisbon2019042592.jpg]
   While we generally avoid the big tourist sites because I'm just not
   that kind of traveler, we took a short tram ride over to see the Belem
   Tower.  It is beautiful but the lines were insane so we admired from
   outside which is totally fine with me. Instead I tried my first
   e-scooter ride and let's just say I'm lucky to make it out alive.  I'll
   stick with my feet for the near future.
   [LondonLisbon20190426130.jpg] [LondonLisbon20190426131.jpg]
   Not quite as popular with tourists but closer to the city center and
   fascinating just the same was the Carmo Convent - an interesting
   architectural site with some interesting artifacts inside.  I took
   Aggie with me while Oscar napped and it was the perfect bite sized
   attraction for a 6 year old.
   [LondonLisbon2019042463.jpg] [LondonLisbon2019042464.jpg]
   [LondonLisbon2019042466.jpg] [LondonLisbon2019042477.jpg]
   I'm sure it's pretty obvious by now we enjoyed our trip.  I don't have
   much more I could say that photos don't do a better job of conveying so
   here are some favorite snaps from our few days in Lisbon.
   [LondonLisbon2019042584.jpg] [LondonLisbon2019042589.jpg]

   [LondonLisbon20190426133.jpg] [LondonLisbon20190426136.jpg]
   Much too soon it was time to pack up and go back home. But Lisbon stole
   a place in my heart and I can't wait to return.  Hope you find this
   recap helpful in your own planning.  If you have any questions or
   comments please add them to the post - I'd love to hear from you!
