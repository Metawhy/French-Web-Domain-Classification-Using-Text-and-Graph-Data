Welcome to RoHS Guide

   RoHS compliance logo

   RoHS stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances, and impacts the
   entire electronics industry and many electrical products as well. The
   original RoHS, also known as Directive 2002/95/EC, originated in the
   European Union in 2002 and restricts the use of six hazardous materials
   found in electrical and electronic products. All applicable products in
   the EU market since July 1, 2006 must pass RoHS compliance.

   Directive 2011/65/EU was published in 2011 by the EU, which is known as
   RoHS-Recast or RoHS 2. RoHS 2 includes a CE-marking directive, with
   RoHS compliance now being required for CE marking of products. RoHS 2
   also added Categories 8 and 9, and has additional compliance
   recordkeeping requirements.

   Directive 2015/863 is known as RoHS 3. RoHS 3 adds four additional
   restricted substances (phthalates) to the list of six. RoHS 3 Deadline
   is 22 July 2019.

Is Your Organization RoHS 3 Compliant for 2019?

   Any business that sells applicable electrical or electronic products,
   equipment, sub-assemblies, cables, components, or spare parts directly
   to RoHS-directed countries, or sells to resellers, distributors or
   integrators that in turn sell products to these countries, is impacted
   if they utilize any of the restricted 10 substances.

   With the rapid spread of digitization, the world's production of
   electrical and electronic devices is exploding. Besides mobile devices,
   think about the coming wave of IoT, smart home assistants, robots,
   drones, 3D printers, and home medical devices to all corners of the
   planet....they are all regulated under RoHS.

   EU RoHS specifies maximum levels for the following 10 restricted
   substances. The first six applied to the original RoHS while the last
   four were added under RoHS 3, which takes effect July 22, 2019.
     * Cadmium (Cd): < 100 ppm
     * Lead (Pb): < 1000 ppm
     * Mercury (Hg): < 1000 ppm
     * Hexavalent Chromium: (Cr VI) < 1000 ppm
     * Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBB): < 1000 ppm
     * Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE): < 1000 ppm
     * Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP): < 1000 ppm
     * Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP): < 1000 ppm
     * Dibutyl phthalate (DBP): < 1000 ppm
     * Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP): < 1000 ppm

   Related to RoHS is WEEE, which stands for Waste from Electrical and
   Electronic Equipment. WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC mandates the treatment,
   recovery and recycling of electric and electronic equipment (90% ends
   up in landfills). All applicable products in the EU market must pass
   WEEE compliance and carry the "Wheelie Bin" sticker.
