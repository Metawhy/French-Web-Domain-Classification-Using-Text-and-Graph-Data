Where I work

   I'm a professor at the University of Rennes 1 in the DiverSE team
   (formerly Triskell) at the INRIA/IRISA Rennes research center.

   Our team, led by Benoit Baudry, focuses on software diversity and all
   of its benefits. Much like ecosystems found in nature, software can
   take advantage of variants that co-exist within these complex systems,
   improving robustness, security and resilience.

   Mostly though, higher levels of diversity provide a pool of software
   solutions that can be used to adapt to unforeseen situations.

   Corruption and recovery for Dynamic Components

What I do

   "Traditional software development is based on the closed-world
   assumption that the boundary between system and environment is known
   and unchanging. However, this assumption no longer works within today’s
   unpredictable open-world settings, which demand techniques that let
   software react to changes by self-organizing its structure and
   self-adapting its behavior."
   Luciano Baresi, Elisabetta Di Nitto, Carlo Ghezzi: Toward Open-World
   Software: Issue and Challenges. IEEE Computer 39(10): 36-43 (2006)

   Sharing this vision, I mainly work on three main challenges.

   First, to increase software resilience, you have to make software
   variants usable, to change from one variant to another, and
   particularly, to tolerate these changes unexpectedly. I'm interested in
   the intricate details of handling dynamic software reconfigurations
   (e.g., quiescence, component decoupling) at both the component and
   architectural levels. I've mostly focused on dynamism in distributed
   component-based frameworks like Kevoree and the use of model-driven
   engineering techniques at runtime also nammed (models@runtime).

   As a second challenge, you have to model software variation points and
   handle variability modeling issues. For this challenge I work on the
   common variability language initiative and I try ;) to contribute to
   the Familiar project.

   As a third challenge, I work to adapt model-driven engineering to this
   open-world assumption. Indeed, the closed world assumption is adopted
   by many modelling framework such as the Ecore defacto standard language
   since complete control of information about the modeled software
   systems is a strong requirement. . To work on that, I work within the
   K3 framework and try to support unespected change and variation point
   in the language design.

Education

   I have received a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of
   Lille, France, November the 29th, 2005. During this PhD, I worked in
   the Jacquard team. My supervisor was Professor Laurence Duchien. I have
   received a Research Master degree in Computer Science from the
   University of Lille as well as an engineer master degree in Information
   and Computer Science from the Ecole des Mines de Douai in 2002. My work
   focuses on software architecture modelling and analysis, and
   architecture-level support for Aspect Oriented Design. My research
   interests include Component Based Software Design, Model-Driven
   Engineering and Aspect Oriented Modelling. Olivier Barais has
   co-authored 8 journal articles and 50 international conference papers,
   in conferences and journals such as Sosym, IEEE Computer, ICSE, MoDELS,
   SPLC and CBSE.
