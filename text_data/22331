Privacy Policy for EEA

   LAST UPDATED: May 2018

   EFFECTIVE: May 25, 2018

   1. INTRODUCTION

   InMobi is committed to respecting and protecting individuals' privacy
   rights. This Privacy Policy explains how InMobi Pte Ltd, its
   subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "InMobi" or "we",
   "us", "our") collect, use, secure, and/or disclose EEA end users’
   (“you” or “your”) device-related information when (i) you view ads
   served by InMobi on third party websites or mobile apps (see the
   section below called "InMobi Ad Network"), and (ii) you visit the
   InMobi website at www.inmobi.com (see section below called "InMobi
   Website").

   Any content aggregation services or feature (such as displaying of
   stories, articles, pictures, blogs etc.) (whether through an app or
   other software integration) provided by InMobi on a device will not be
   covered under this Privacy Policy, except to the extent the app or
   software promotes any interest-based advertising by InMobi. We urge you
   to refer the privacy policy of such services separately, as and when
   made available.

   “EEA” means all member states of the European Union and for the purpose
   of this Privacy Policy, U.K. and Switzerland.

   2. INMOBI ADVERTISING

   2.1 WHAT IS THE INMOBI AD NETWORK?

   InMobi is a global ad network with a suite of ad tech products. We
   partner with third-party mobile website publishers and mobile app
   developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps, and InMobi
   may also serve ads on the site and mobile applications that InMobi
   owns. These ads may be customised to their users' interests and
   geographic locations, which we may derive or infer from information
   that we collect about how those users interact with such sites and apps
   (this type of advertising is often called "interest-based advertising"
   or "targeted advertising"). This enables our partnering publishers and
   developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to
   their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to
   offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost. Further, we may
   also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or
   advertisers’ partners for optimising digital advertising and/or
   analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and
   reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is
   governed by the privacy policy of such third party partners and/or
   advertisers providing the same.

   InMobi may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the
   process of collecting data from devices that have been determined
   through statistical analysis to be linked or related. We, or third
   parties whom we engage to provide this service, may use cross-device
   data to provide interest-based advertising services and to deliver
   tailored ads to users across multiple devices.

   2.2 WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

   When you view an InMobi ad on a site or app, we may collect information
   about your device that you have viewed. This information enables us to
   improve our services including recognising your device when you use
   other sites and apps that have partnered with us.

   (a) Information about your device

   InMobi may collect some or all of the following information about your
   device: device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet, etc.),operating system
   (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry), network provider, mobile
   browser used (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer etc.),platform, SDK
   version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application
   version, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors,
   model, manufacture of device, OS version of device, session start/stop
   time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time
   zone, network status such as WiFi, the geo-location of your device
   (using GPS or other geo-location data) and the Identifier for
   Advertising (IDFA) or the Google Advertising ID (AAID) etc. In some
   countries, we also collect information such as international mobile
   equipment identity (IMEI), Internet (IP) addresses or geo-location
   data, which may be considered to be personal information and in which
   case, we ensure compliance with applicable laws in our collection or
   use of the same, to the extent applicable in such jurisdictions.

   InMobi may collect the geo-location of your device only when an app or
   site, which leverages InMobi’s offerings through integration of
   InMobi’s technology/software (whether SDK, API or other integration) is
   active on the device. One way InMobi derives a device’s location is by
   collecting the device’s latitude and longitude coordinates through GPS.
   InMobi may infer the geo location of a device based on data collected
   through a WiFi identifier that the device is connected to, subject to
   country specific laws and/or industry guidelines related to such
   collection or inference practices. e.g: In the U.S. and UK, InMobi may
   infer geo-location through WiFi identifiers pursuant to obtaining user
   consent through applicable apps or sites.

   (b) Information about ads presented on your device

   InMobi also collects some or all of the following information about an
   ad presented on your device: (i) the content type of the ad (what the
   ad is about, e.g. games, finance, entertainment, news); (ii) the ad
   type (e.g. whether the ad is a text, image, or video based ad); (iii)
   where the ad is being served (e.g. the address of the site on which the
   ad appears); and (iv) certain information about post-click activity in
   relation to the ad including user interaction with such ad.

   On occasion, our partnering mobile publishers or app developers may
   also disclose to us certain information including email addresses of
   users in a hashed format (not in raw format) they have separately
   collected about you so that we can improve the relevance of the ads we
   serve on their behalf. They do this in accordance with their own
   specific privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal
   requirements. We do not use the information they provide to us for any
   purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads or for reporting
   or analytical purpose(s).

   2.3 HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?

   InMobi uses the information that we collect from your device to display
   advertising on your device, which may include interest-based
   advertising customised to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences
   and locations and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services.

   The information we collect from your device also helps us to provide
   filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing
   on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for
   advertisers. We rely on your consent to process your personal data in
   this way. If you do not consent, the ads you see will be less tailored
   to your interests. In particular, processing your data in this way help
   our publishers and developer clients, for example, to avoid presenting
   you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser clients
   serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you.

   2.4 WHO DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH?

   (a) Publishers, Developers, Advertisers, Data Partners and Measurement
   Companies

   InMobi may share the information we collect or receive regarding you as
   described in this Policy with our publishers, developers, data
   partners, measurement companies and advertisers. These partners may use
   this information to show you relevant ads, measure your ad/site
   interaction, identify your interest areas, better understand the site
   and app traffic usage or user behaviour in order to refine and improve
   their services. Such partners’ use of the information we share with
   them will be governed by their privacy policies.

   (b) With InMobi Affiliates

   We may also share your information with InMobi affiliates so that we
   can better provide advertising that is relevant to you.

   (c) Sharing Info with third parties such as advisors and law
   enforcement authorities.

   From time to time, we may also need to disclose your information to
   other third parties, such as law enforcement authorities or our legal
   advisers, where it is necessary to: comply with the law or regulations;
   enforce or apply our user terms and conditions; protect our rights, or;
   preserve the safety of our users. This may include exchanging
   information with other companies and organizations for fraud
   protection.

   InMobi may also share your information in connection with any merger, a
   sale of InMobi assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a
   portion of our business to another company.

   InMobi uses reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect
   the information it collects about you and your device. We may anonymise
   the information we collect using one-way hashing technology before
   sharing it with any third parties. We also seek appropriate contractual
   protection from our partners regarding their treatment of user data.

   6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP INFORMATION FOR?

   InMobi may retain the information relating to your device collected
   from partnering mobile publishers or app developers for a period of up
   to thirteen (13) months, unless otherwise required by law or applicable
   contract. After the 13-month period, InMobi may retain and use such
   data in aggregated format, as necessary for internal analytical
   purposes, to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and
   enforce agreements.

   Where we are using personal information to contact for marketing
   communications, if opted-in we will contact you periodically, if
   required by applicable laws, to ensure you are happy to continue
   receiving such communications.

   If informed of election to no longer receive marketing communications
   from us, InMobi will stop sending the same.

   7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

   InMobi may share your information with clients, affiliates and other
   third parties described above who are based in countries outside of
   your country of residence (for example, if you are an EU resident, we
   may share your information with our non-EU clients or affiliates),
   subject to any contractual or legal requirements. This means that their
   processing of your personal information will involve a transfer of data
   outside of the EEA.

   Whenever InMobi transfers your personal information outside of the EEA,
   we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following
   safeguards is in place:
     * by transferring your personal information to a country that has
       been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the
       European Commission;
     * by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission
       which give your personal information the same protection it has
       within the EEA including to US;
     * where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
       them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
       provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe
       and the US.

   If you wish to learn more about the specific circumstances when each of
   these protection measures are used, you can contact us at
   privacy@inmobi.com for the details as to how we protect specific
   transfer of your data.

   All information you provide to InMobi is stored on our secure servers
   or those of our third party data storage providers. Where we have given
   you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
   certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this

Our Story

   InMobi was conceptualized and born against all odds. A company based
   out of India tackling mobile in 2007 was no ordinary task. Venture
   Capital was hard to come by and investors frowned on internet companies
   from India. InMobi was founded in this opaque environment because its
   founders had foresight and the required passion to be able to disrupt
   an industry. Some of the world’s greatest innovations are always met
   with hostility and InMobi was no different. This is our story – the
   story of how we built a tech powerhouse headquartered in India.
