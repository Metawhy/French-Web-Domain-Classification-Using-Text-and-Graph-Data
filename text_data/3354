Sharing Hope Through Toy Donations While Decluttering Your Home

Learn How to Donate Toys And Spread the Joy

   Now that Christmas is gone, it is time to clean the house and
   declutter. With spring right around the corner, you have to need to
   clean up all the added junk that came in post the Thanksgiving and
   Christmas celebration.

   If you have children, you will know how difficult it often gets to
   clean up the house. Things get worse when there are more kids toys than
   kids, which is how it usually happens. Since Christmas is the time that
   children get new toys from relatives and friends, they need to
   understand that they should donate and share their old toys with the
   kids who cannot enjoy them. Numerous charities and orphanages take in
   old toys, and it is an excellent way to declutter the house and make
   space for new toys.

   While kids can sometimes be possessive about their toys and trikes,
   they need to understand that they should share. Christmas is the time
   for giving and by sharing their best trikes with kids who hardly have
   any toys to play with, they spread happiness. A little girl in an
   orphanage would be happy to receive some of the best musical
   instruments for toddlers and play with it.

If you are planning on donating your children’s toys to different charities,
here is how you should go about it.

     * Ask for their opinion: Start a conversation and ask your kids where
       they would want to donate their dota 2 action figures and why. Once
       they have decided on a place, allow the kids to decide which toys
       they want to give and which ones they want to keep for themselves.
       Each kid has a set of toys that are precious to them, so let them
       make a choice and respect their opinion.

     * Help them pick up charities and donations: When you ask your
       children to pick the charities and donations they want to give
       their toys to, they learn about giving and also experience the joy
       of sharing. If they choose a charity for babies, make them realize
       that the best bath toys for babies would be a better choice than
       their collection of guns.

     * Set a Target: It is evident that children would be attached to
       their toys and hence you need to set a goal for them. Do not make
       the process harder than it already is. To get them to pick toys,
       tell them for every two toys they keep, they have to donate the
       next one to charity. In this way, they will get the privilege to
       decide whether they want to give the best electric ride on toys or
       the learning toys for kids.

     * Reward the kids for their decisions: During the process continue
       praising them and telling them how proud you are of them.

   These simple steps will help you donate toys and also clean your house.
   Spread the joy all year round by donating toys and clothes to charities
   for children. The act helps children appreciate their life and also
   experience the joy of giving.
