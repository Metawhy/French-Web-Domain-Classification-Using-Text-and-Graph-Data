Algarve’s best beaches

     * View Larger Image Buy Property Lagos

   The 150 kilometres of the southern Algarve coast are one of the most
   sensational stretches of seaside in the world. You would have no
   trouble finding a different beach for every day of the year. They cover
   all sorts of beaches too, something for everyone: long, quiet beaches
   backed by sand dunes, tiny beaches surrounded by cliffs, resort beaches
   where the beach bars bang out the tunes to accompany your evening dip,
   or remote coves where no-one cares if you abandon the bikini.

   Praia do Anção, near Quinta do Lago, Vilamoura

   Green acres property portugal beach

   Backed by sand dunes, this long stretch of sandy beach is within the
   Golden Triangle of upmarket resorts and year-round entertainment at the
   heart of the Algarve. Its position means that this beach is both
   unspoilt and yet well equipped for a day of good quality eating and
   drinking along with the sunbathing. It’s a wonderful beach for the
   family too, with life guards and good facilities. The town of Vilamoura
   is highly popular with property buyers, with upmarket property
   surrounding golf courses, spas, high class shopping and excellent
   nightlife.


   Praia da Marinha, Carvoeiro and Lagoa

   Green acres portugal property beach

   It has graced a thousand brochures and websites, being that perfect
   colour combination of turquoise sea, sky of blue and honey-coloured
   cliffs. The cliffs and coves to the side are a snorkeler’s dream. This
   isn’t the only amazing beach in the area, and the beach is not the only
   attraction. It is by the lovely village of Carvoeiro, all white-washed
   Moorish-style houses, but with plenty of opportunity to buy a modern
   style property as the village stretches inland and joins the small city
   of Lagoa (not to be confused with Lagos which is far to the east).


   Praia do Amado, Carrapateira

   Green acres property portugal beach

   Have you tried surfing yet? Come on now, you’re only young once and you
   don’t want to wake up in a home aged 95 realising you’ve left it too
   late! The great thing about surfing is that stick a wetsuit on and you
   can do it all year. The beach is within a wide bay, with simple beach
   bars and surf schools. Carrapateira is round the headland on the west
   coast of the Algarve but is reachable in about 40 minutes from Lagos
   and even closer to Luz, both popular among overseas property buyers.
   Lagos is a historic and traditional town, less tourist orientated and
   lively all year round and surrounded by beautiful countryside.


   Praia da Luz, Western Algarve

   Green acres property portugal beach

   Just a few kilometres beyond Lagos, Luz is a popular place for family
   holidays in summer but retains a large expat community all year. It was
   a fishing village but is more famous now for its long sandy beach. It’s
   a 100kilometre drive from Faro Airport but this beach is worth it.
   Light golden sand, backed by cliffs that stretch away into low hills
   among which the holiday villages and hotels nestle.


   Tavira, Eastern Algarve

   Green acres property portugal beach

   The beaches of the eastern Algarve are different – they tend to be
   barrier islands that you have to reach by boat. They are warmer but
   wilder and emptier too. The town of Tavira is elegant and wealthy, with
   cobbled streets and 200-year-old mansions. Around it are smaller
   fishing villages with wonderful restaurants serving up the catch of the
   day. It is also very handy for the airport either by road or railway.
   From the city, you get to the beach by water taxi or a ferry costing a
   couple euros return.
