       I bought the Elac Discovery.
       I have been trying to add Folder. I have beeng trying to add
       Itunes.IMPOSSIBLE.
       I have read what others users say about the network path, smb,
       host. Trying und trying again, like an Obsession. NO information
       from Elac, from Chris Walker.
       There is a lack of Respect to the users. The Discovery is not a
       cheap Toy, we all deserve a information, step by step, and support
       we need also.
       Please Chris could you tell us how to add a Folder, how to play
       Itunes.
       Thanks. Cimbelino.

       Hi Cimbelino,
       I am sorry you are having problems adding your itunes folder to the
       Discovery. What operating system are you using?
       I will do my best to help you out.

       Thanks a lot, Chris.
       I am using Mac Os, Apple mini Mac.
       I have problems to find the Network Path to add a Folder.
       I can not find the right adresse to add my iTunes Library.
       Can you please help me?

       Also /Users/pl1/Music and I can not get it.

       Thanks.

            Hi Cimbelino,
            I currently do not have a mac in our office, however I just
            purchased one and it is supposed to be here tomorrow.
            I will create a process for adding folders from a MAC very
            soon after I receive it.
            Thanks,
            Chris

       Dear Sir,
       I am quit happy with the Elac Discovery. There is however one thing
       that causes irritation.
       Whenever I run a search in Tidal eg artist (on Roon app in iOS), I
       can only retrieve a name which is already in my Library.
       Other artists available in Tidal can not be found. So I have to go
       to the Tidal app , run a search , add the music to my collection
       and wait till it is synchronized into the Roon app. Is this the
       standard procedure ?? I thought Tidal was fully integrated into
       Roon/Elac.
       Thank you in advance.
       François

       Hello Francois,
       Tidal is really well integrated into Roon Essential and the
       Discovery System.
       When you run a search it will first come up with “Library Artist”
       as the search is much faster. Then after a few moments it will
       search tidal and you should see a “TIDAL Artist” section once the
       search is completed. If you scroll down it will show artists,
       albums, and tracks. I have tried this on both the iPhone and iPad.
       If you are still not seeing it, please email me:
       Customerservice@elac.us As screen shot are a little easier to share
       via email.
       Thanks,
       Charles Mallari

       Hi Elac team,
       I would like to get back to the topic “Search capability of ROON
       Essential in TIDAL”. When am doing a search via ROON App (doesn’t
       matters if it’s done on PC, MAC, IPhone…) e.g. for the Playlist
       Blips & Blops only results for “Tidal Alben” and “Tidal Title” can
       be found, but unfortunately no results at all for “Tidal Playlists”
       and “Tidal Artists”….
       E.g. go in the ROON App to Tidal/Playlists/New Playlists, you will
       find e.g. the Playlist called Blips & Blops, just to proof that it
       already exists within Tidal. Now try to search for it, no hit will
       appear. You can easily reproduce it with another Playlist.
       Using the original Desktop App from Tidal the search for Blips &
       Blops will give you several results for Artist, Album, Playlist,
       Video, Title.
       Am I overlooking something? How can I get results for Playlists
       within ROON essentials? Currently the search capability is quite
       low and not satisfying at all.
       Is there any improvement to be expected with an upcoming update?
       Kind Regards,
       Sven

       You are quite correct, there is a need for a Tidal Playlist search
       function. This has previously been requested, and the request bears
       repeating.
       In the meantime, the best you can do in Roon Essentials regarding
       Tidal Playlists is to Browse them.
       TO FIND PLAYLISTS WITHIN ROON ESSENTIALS:
       Click on the three bars in the upper left to display the home menu,
       if necessary.
       Under BROWSE click on TIDAL.
       On the screen that opens click on the word “Playlists” in the menu
       near the top of the screen.
       Then click on the mood of Tidal Playlists you wish to browse, OR
       under Playlists at the bottom left of the screen choose from
       NEW/RECCOMMENDED/EXCLUSIVE/MASTERS and view your displayed choices.
       A short row of playlists appears. If you don’t see anything you
       want to play, on the bottom far right click “View All.” This shows
       additional playlists within the category previously selected, for
       example all the NEW Playlists.
       Use the right arrow key (or the mouse scroll button) to move thru
       the screens of this list, or choose a different category (or mood).
       The above lets you browse Tidal Playlists. These playlists are not
       the same as your personal playlists. Personal playlists can be
       sorted and searched via the “Playlist” button on the home menu. If
       and when you find a TIDAL Playlist you really like its a snap to
       copy all of it or a portion of it to your personal playlist
       collection (and to edit it as desired, rename it, reorder it, etc)
       where it is now searchable / easy to find again.

       While we are wishing, It would be great to be able to search in
       Roon for, for example, all Tidal Playlists which include a certain
       artist or song.

       I have only yesterday received my ELac-S12EQ subwoofer and I have
       some questions about setting it up and the various settings on the
       app. I added this subwoofer to my front speakers which are
       Wharfedale Jade 3 – a rather large bookshelf curved back speaker at
       5 inches wide 17 inches tall and 15 inches deep.
       I did the near field and listening position EQ calibration which
       went very smoothly using my iPad Mini. Now besides the volume and
       the Auto On/Off features, I am not sure where to set the others to
       like the Low Pass, the Phase, the delay and the Parametric
       Equalizer?
       Also my Harman Kardon A/V receiver has it own EQ using the old
       wired mike held at the listening position for all of the speakers
       in my 5.1 system – do I use that after I finish my Elac EQ
       calibration (near field and listening position)? Will the HK AVR EQ
       change the settings of the ELac EQ set up?
       Of course I am trying to set up this quality subwoofer to enhance
       both my music and movies and would appreciate any and all
       assistance in fine tuning this sub.

       I have the same question. I recently purchased your 3010.
       Any input would be greatly appreciated.
       Thx

       I bought the Elac Discovery.
       I have been trying to add Folder. I have beeng trying to add
       Itunes.IMPOSSIBLE.
       I have read what others users say about the network path, smb,
       host. Trying und trying again, like an Obsession. NO information
       from Elac, from Chris Walker.
       There is a lack of Respect to the users. The Discovery is not a
       cheap Toy, we all deserve a information, step by step, and support
       we need also.
       Please Chris could you tell us how to add a Folder, how to play
       Itunes.
       Thanks. Cimbelino.

       Hi Cimbelino,
       I am sorry you are having problems adding your itunes folder to the
       Discovery. What operating system are you using?
       I will do my best to help you out.

       Thanks a lot, Chris.
       I am using Mac Os, Apple mini Mac.
       I have problems to find the Network Path to add a Folder.
       I can not find the right adresse to add my iTunes Library.
       Can you please help me?
       I put smb:\\192.168.2.108\Music but does not work.
       Also /Users/pl1/Music and I can not get it.
       Itunes:/Users/pl1/Music/iTunesLibrary.xml no use.
       Thanks.

            Hi Cimbelino,
            I currently do not have a mac in our office, however I just
            purchased one and it is supposed to be here tomorrow.
            I will create a process for adding folders from a MAC very
            soon after I receive it.
            Thanks,
            Chris

       Dear Sir,
       I am quit happy with the Elac Discovery. There is however one thing
       that causes irritation.
       Whenever I run a search in Tidal eg artist (on Roon app in iOS), I
       can only retrieve a name which is already in my Library.
       Other artists available in Tidal can not be found. So I have to go
       to the Tidal app , run a search , add the music to my collection
       and wait till it is synchronized into the Roon app. Is this the
       standard procedure ?? I thought Tidal was fully integrated into
       Roon/Elac.
       Thank you in advance.

       Hello Francois,
       Tidal is really well integrated into Roon Essential and the
       Discovery System.
       When you run a search it will first come up with “Library Artist”
       as the search is much faster. Then after a few moments it will
       search tidal and you should see a “TIDAL Artist” section once the
       search is completed. If you scroll down it will show artists,
       albums, and tracks. I have tried this on both the iPhone and iPad.
       If you are still not seeing it, please email me:
       Customerservice@elac.us As screen shot are a little easier to share
       via email.
       Thanks,
       Charles Mallari

       Hi Elac team,
       I would like to get back to the topic “Search capability of ROON
       Essential in TIDAL”. When am doing a search via ROON App (doesn’t
       matters if it’s done on PC, MAC, IPhone…) e.g. for the Playlist
       Blips & Blops only results for “Tidal Alben” and “Tidal Title” can
       be found, but unfortunately no results at all for “Tidal Playlists”
       and “Tidal Artists”….
       E.g. go in the ROON App to Tidal/Playlists/New Playlists, you will
       find e.g. the Playlist called Blips & Blops, just to proof that it
       already exists within Tidal. Now try to search for it, no hit will
       appear. You can easily reproduce it with another Playlist.
       Using the original Desktop App from Tidal the search for Blips &
       Blops will give you several results for Artist, Album, Playlist,
       Video, Title.
       Am I overlooking something? How can I get results for Playlists
       within ROON essentials? Currently the search capability is quite
       low and not satisfying at all.
       Is there any improvement to be expected with an upcoming update?
       Kind Regards,
       Sven

       You are quite correct, there is a need for a Tidal Playlist search
       function. This has previously been requested, and the request bears
       repeating.
       In the meantime, the best you can do in Roon Essentials regarding
       Tidal Playlists is to Browse them.
       TO FIND PLAYLISTS WITHIN ROON ESSENTIALS:
       Click on the three bars in the upper left to display the home menu,
       if necessary.
       Under BROWSE click on TIDAL.
       On the screen that opens click on the word “Playlists” in the menu
       near the top of the screen.
       Then click on the mood of Tidal Playlists you wish to browse, OR
       under Playlists at the bottom left of the screen choose from
       NEW/RECCOMMENDED/EXCLUSIVE/MASTERS and view your displayed choices.
       A short row of playlists appears. If you don’t see anything you
       want to play, on the bottom far right click “View All.” This shows
       additional playlists within the category previously selected, for
       example all the NEW Playlists.
       Use the right arrow key (or the mouse scroll button) to move thru
       the screens of this list, or choose a different category (or mood).
       The above lets you browse Tidal Playlists. These playlists are not
       the same as your personal playlists. Personal playlists can be
       sorted and searched via the “Playlist” button on the home menu. If
       and when you find a TIDAL Playlist you really like its a snap to
       copy all of it or a portion of it to your personal playlist
       collection (and to edit it as desired, rename it, reorder it, etc)
       where it is now searchable / easy to find again.

       While we are wishing, It would be great to be able to search in
       Roon for, for example, all Tidal Playlists which include a certain
       artist or song.

       I have only yesterday received my ELac-S12EQ subwoofer and I have
       some questions about setting it up and the various settings on the
       app. I added this subwoofer to my front speakers which are
       Wharfedale Jade 3 – a rather large bookshelf curved back speaker at
       5 inches wide 17 inches tall and 15 inches deep.
       I did the near field and listening position EQ calibration which
       went very smoothly using my iPad Mini. Now besides the volume and
       the Auto On/Off features, I am not sure where to set the others to
       like the Low Pass, the Phase, the delay and the Parametric
       Equalizer?
       Also my Harman Kardon A/V receiver has it own EQ using the old
       wired mike held at the listening position for all of the speakers
       in my 5.1 system – do I use that after I finish my Elac EQ
       calibration (near field and listening position)? Will the HK AVR EQ
       change the settings of the ELac EQ set up?
       Of course I am trying to set up this quality subwoofer to enhance
       both my music and movies and would appreciate any and all
