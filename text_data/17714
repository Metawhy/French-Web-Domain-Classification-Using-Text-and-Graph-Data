THEY TALK ABOUT US

   It is the best system to arrange meetings I have come across in the
   industry.
   Mette Clark - United Kingdom
   Mette Clark - United KingdomDirector - Alpha Games

   Without question I’ll come away from this conference and over the 6-8
   months there will be business deals that come from the meetings I’ve
   had here.
   Mike Gamble - United Kingdom
   Mike Gamble - United KingdomEU Territory Manager - Epic Games

   The experience was invaluable. Seeing the industry from the inside like
   that and pitching your game to experienced publishers in person, is
   something every game developer should try.
   Kenneth Holstein Kruse - Denmark
   Kenneth Holstein Kruse - DenmarkCEO - Pareidolia Games

   If every event had such a useful app it would be much easier to set up
   meetings!
   Antoine Grimond - France
   Antoine Grimond - FranceCOO - Gameblr Esports

   GCA is for us the best industry event of the year, period.
   Damien Urvois - Japan
   Damien Urvois - JapanOverseas department head - Compile Heart

   If somebody has clear needs for business connections, Game Connection
   will definitely let him/her create them.
   Mikael Bourget - Poland
   Mikael Bourget - PolandBusiness Development - AdoptMyGame

   It’s very good for finding the right kind of developers. I go to all
   the other events every year but Game Connection is the best one.
