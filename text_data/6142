   Expanded from last year to now feature 75 institutions, this year’s
   ranking of the top business analytics postgraduate programs is once
   again topped by the MIT Sloan School of Management. The
   Massachusetts-based school achieves a perfect score in three of the
   five indicators used to compile the ranking. Click here to learn more
   about the methodology.

   This year, Imperial College Business School is a new entrant in second
   place, making it the best business analytics program in Europe. Program
   director Professor Kalyan Talluri said their program does everything it
   can to prepare graduates for the working world. He said: “We train our
   graduates to be highly self-sufficient and productive from day one –
   it’s a fundamental element of our program’s design.  Plus we place a
   huge emphasis on communication, and creating narratives from data and
   analytical analysis – which I believe is critical for analytics to make
   an impact within the organization.”

   In third place is the University of Texas at Austin’s McCombs School of
   Business. A spokesperson for the school said: “Amid the recent
   explosive growth of analytics in academia, what sets our program apart
   is our insistence on technically-trained quantitative analysts who can
   communicate their expertise to others. We train our students on both
   the technical aspects of being an analyst as well as the ability to be
   a good story teller to the decision maker.”

   Expanded from last year to now feature 75 institutions, this year’s
   ranking of the top business analytics postgraduate programs is once
   again topped by the MIT Sloan School of Management. The
   Massachusetts-based school achieves a perfect score in three of the
   five indicators used to compile the ranking. Click here to learn more
   about the methodology.

   This year, Imperial College Business School is a new entrant in second
   place, making it the best business analytics program in Europe. Program
   director Professor Kalyan Talluri said their program does everything it
   can to prepare graduates for the working world. He said: “We train our
   graduates to be highly self-sufficient and productive from day one –
   it’s a fundamental element of our program’s design.  Plus we place a
   huge emphasis on communication, and creating narratives from data and
   analytical analysis – which I believe is critical for analytics to make
   an impact within the organization.”

   In third place is the University of Texas at Austin’s McCombs School of
   Business. A spokesperson for the school said: “Amid the recent
   explosive growth of analytics in academia, what sets our program apart
   is our insistence on technically-trained quantitative analysts who can
   communicate their expertise to others. We train our students on both
   the technical aspects of being an analyst as well as the ability to be
   a good story teller to the decision maker.”
