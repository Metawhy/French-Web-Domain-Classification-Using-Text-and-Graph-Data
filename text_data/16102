   These crostini are goood. Lots of garlic, tender shrimp coated with
   smoky spices, creamy avocado, lime, and arugula to add a bit of bite.

   When I was done taking these photos, the crostini became my dinner.
   My taste buds and tummy were happy.

   It doesn’t take long to make these. Slice a baguette, add the slices to
   a baking sheet, brush them with a mixture of minced garlic and olive
   oil, bake them for 10-15 minutes, and prep the rest while you wait.

   The shrimp themselves only take about 5 minutes to cook. Quick and easy
   and full of flavor is definitely my approach to cooking these days!

   My popular posts fluctuate every month, but one thing remains constant
   – my shrimp recipes seem to do quite well. Three of my top 4 recipes
   this month are shrimp recipes! Fingers crossed that you guys like this
   shrimp recipe too. 🙂 I just love shrimp.

   Like I keep mentioning in every bloody post (yeah I don’t know when to
   stop), it’s not spring here yet. I’m desperate for warm weather. It
   somehow makes me feel better to make easy, colorful, fresh food [DEL:
   and complain a lot to strangers who are nice enough to read my blog.
   :DEL] That’s what tides me over in between trips to warm places,
   anyway.

   We’re in the middle of a cold snap right now, so I’m extra cranky.
   March is a weird month here. My sister’s birthday is in March, and
   sometimes it’s -25C and a blizzard. Other times it’s positively
   spring-like. I’m sure you probably don’t come here for my complaining,
   so please send some warm weather my way already. < /end rant >

   And back to the food. The avocado mixture is basically a simplified
   guacamole. I mashed up an avocado with a bit of lime juice and salt &
   pepper. Despite the chili powder, I really wouldn’t call the shrimp
   spicy.

   The crostini are flavorful, yes, spicy not so much, especially when you
   take the avocado and bread into account.

   If you buy a bag of frozen shrimp like I did, you can easily make more
   than 12 of these. Just make sure you have an extra avocado on hand, and
   adjust the other ingredients as needed. Enjoy!

   Will you make these garlic shrimp and avocado crostini?

Garlic Shrimp and Avocado Crostini

   Easy & delicious garlicky shrimp and avocado crostini.
   Course Appetizer
   Cuisine American
   Keyword shrimp and avocado appetizer, shrimp crostini
   Prep Time 10 minutes
   Cook Time 15 minutes
   Total Time 25 minutes
   Servings 1 dozen crostini
   Author Salt & Lavender

Ingredients

     * 12 medium to large shrimp thawed, peeled & deveined
     * 12 baguette slices (about 1/2"-3/4" thick)
     * 4 cloves garlic minced
     * 2 tablespoons olive oil
     * 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
     * 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
     * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
     * Juice of 1/4 lime
     * 1 avocado
     * Arugula to taste
     * Salt & pepper to taste

Instructions

    1. Preheat oven to 350F and move the rack to the top. Line a baking
       sheet with foil and place the baguette slices on there.
    2. Add the olive oil and minced garlic to a small bowl. Brush the
       baguette slices on both sides with the oil/garlic mix. Bake for
       10-15 minutes or until they're as crispy as you want. 15 minutes
       made them really crispy.
    3. Meanwhile, add a splash of olive oil to a skillet on medium-high
       heat. Add the shrimp, chili powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika,
       and salt & pepper to taste. Cook, stirring often, until the shrimp
       are pink (about 5 mins). Remove the pan from the heat.
    4. In a small bowl, mash the avocado, lime, and a bit of salt & pepper
       together.
    5. Once the baguette slices are toasted, let them cool for a few
       minutes and then spread a layer of avocado on each one. Top with
       the arugula and shrimp. Serve immediately.

Recipe Notes

     * I buy the 3/4 pound bags of frozen shrimp, so I had some left over.
       If you buy 3/4 or 1 lb. of shrimp, you can easily make more than 12
       of these. Just ensure you have a second avocado, and increase the
       other ingredients as needed.
     * I used a sourdough baguette for these crostini.

       Did this with pre-made guacamole as there weren’t any ripe avocados
       available. Didn’t have to add garlic or seasonings to it either.
       Some baby arugula fresh from the garden and it was delish!

            Hi Sue, I think it would work if you prepared the bread and
            the shrimp and then kept the shrimp in the fridge until
            serving. I would wait as late as possible to mash up the
            avocado because it will go brown the longer you leave it. Hope
            you enjoy these!

       These are gorgeous! I usually go in for the sweets, but I saw the
       cover photo for this and had to click over. Shrimp and avocado are
       two of my favorite things. These look just perfect for
       entertaining. Can’t wait to try them. Thanks!

   These Caprese crostini turned out even better than I expected.

   Every single piece was polished off shortly after these photos were
   taken!

   So… what do we have here?
     * Baguette slices brushed with olive oil and garlic and baked to
       crispy perfection
     * Fresh mozzarella melted onto each baguette slice
     * Sweet tomatoes and fresh basil
     * A delicious balsamic reduction drizzled over top

   Damn.

   These would make a great appetizer or finger food for a party, or you
   know, a party for one. I’m not judging. I wouldn’t blame you one bit
   for keeping these to yourself.

   I couldn’t make up my mind on what color of tomatoes I wanted, so I got
   all three (red, yellow, orange). I’m glad I did since the photos turned
   out so pretty. And yes, we’ll be eating the rest of the tomatoes all
   week long. 😛

   These are very easy to make, too. Brush each slice of bread with olive
   oil and garlic, bake ’em, make the balsamic drizzle while they’re
   baking and your kitchen is filling with the wonderful garlicky aroma,
   top them with the mozza, broil it for a few minutes to achieve melty
   perfection, then top them with the tomatoes, basil, and a drizzle of
   the balsamic reduction.  Ok, that’s a long sentence.

   I hope you really love these! I think they’ll fit perfectly into your
   summer entertaining plans. 😉

   Keyword caprese crostini
   Prep Time 15 minutes
   Cook Time 15 minutes
   Total Time 30 minutes
   Servings 12 crostini
   Author Salt & Lavender

Ingredients

     * 1 demi baguette or 1/2 standard-sized baguette
     * 2 tablespoons olive oil
     * 3 cloves garlic minced
     * fresh mozzarella sliced into 12 equal pieces (approx. 12 ounces)
     * 8 ounces (or to taste) assorted tomatoes sliced
     * Handful fresh basil chopped finely
     * Salt & pepper to taste

Balsamic drizzle:

     * 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
     * 1 tablespoon liquid honey

Instructions

    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Add olive oil and garlic to a small bowl.
    2. Slice the baguette into 12 approx. 1/2" slices. Arrange them on a
       baking sheet. Brush the olive oil and garlic mixture onto both
       sides of each slice. Bake for 10 minutes.
    3. Meanwhile, add the balsamic vinegar and honey to a small pan. Cook
       it on medium-high (reduce to medium if it's furiously bubbling) for
       about 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture easily coats the back of a
       spoon. It tends to thicken up more as it cools, so make sure you
       don't overdo it or you'll be left with a stuck-on mess. Set aside.
    4. While your balsamic reduction is cooking, you can slice the
       tomatoes and chop the basil.
    5. Set your oven's broiler to high and move the rack to the top third
       of the oven. Add a mozzarella slice to each piece of bread. Broil
       for 5 minutes or until the cheese melts (watch it closely), taking
       care not to burn the bread.
    6. Top the crostini with the tomatoes, basil, a drizzle of the
       balsamic reduction, and some salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

Recipe Notes

     * This recipe is for 12 slices of bread. You can easily double the
       recipe or adjust if you have more ingredients.
     * Feel free to use store-bought balsamic glaze if that's easier.

       This is my kind of appetizer Natasha. They wouldn’t have lasted
       long after photos at my house either!
