Printable Paint stick Ornaments, Names of Christ, Spanish Version

   Over the last few years I've received several requests for a Spanish
   version of the Names of Christ templates for my paint stick ornaments.
   The problem? I don't speak any Spanish. Recently though Lori Keller
   offered to put a list together for me of the names of Christ in Spanish
   with the help of her husband Bennett. With this list I was finally able
   to create another template for anyone who would like to make the
   ornaments with the Names of Christ in Spanish. I'm so grateful for
   their help and so excited to be able to share this with you!

   link below which will take you to the original post with all of the
   information about the paint stick ornaments. Scroll almost to the
   bottom of the post for the link to the Spanish Version.

Simple Berry Wreath

   Happy New Year!  Hope your holidays were all that you hoped they would
   be.
   I don't have anything too grand or exciting to share this time, just a
   simple berry wreath that I put together with a red berry garland
   (purchased for $12 on clearance) and the grapevine wreath that I
   borrowed from a wreath that I made last Fall.
   [Red+Berry+Grapevine+Wreath.jpg]
   [Simple+Berry+Wreath.jpg]
   My door is not magnetic so instead of using a heavy duty wreath magnet
   like I've done in the past, I stapled a 4" wide strip of burlap to the
   top of the door with a standard stapler and then ran a piece of duct
   tape over the staples to make sure they would stay put.  It's not the
   most glamorous method, but it can't be seen and has held strong for
   several weeks now.
   [Winter+Wreath.jpg]
   By next January maybe I'll have more that I can set out (in addition to
   our DIY ant trap in the bottom left corner, oops should have moved
   that), but for now, I'm loving this little pop of color that helps to
   brighten things up on these dreary, overcast, winter days.

Holiday S'mores Kit with 'HOME' Wood Block

   Christmas is less than a week away now and I'm scrambling to finish
   some small gifts for neighbors and friends. Today I'm sharing with you
   a new variation of a gift that I put together a couple of years
   ago--remember the S'mores Kit's?  We live in a new town now so I guess
   one of the perks of moving is that I can recycle old ideas and use them
   again on new friends and neighbors--saves me some thinking time! ;)
   [Holiday+S&#39;mores+Kit.jpg]
   I purchased the cute snowman gift sacks at Wal-mart for .75 each.  It
   turned out that the colors were exactly the same as the colors that I
   used for the s'mores tags--lucky!  I glued the kit contents tag to the
   side of the bag (and added one staple at the top for good measure), cut
   out the circle tag, and tied it to the bamboo skewers with red satin
   ribbon.
   Download the free printable tags here.
   [S&#39;mores+Kit+Small+Gift+Idea.jpg]
   Kit Contents:
     * 1 package of graham crackers
     * 20 marshmallows in a clear cello sack (check your local dollar
       stores)
     * 9 snack size Hershey's chocolate bars
     * 4 bamboo skewers for roasting the marshmallows over a stove plate
       (with an adults permission and supervision of course).
     * 'HOME' Wood Block

   I thought it would be fun if the chocolate bars looked like little
   "brown paper packages tied up with string" so I placed them on a piece
   of the cardboard packaging that they came on and tied them together
   with some string (from Lowe's).
   [S&#39;mores+Kit+Contents.jpg]
   Last month I saw the cutest little wood block that simply said 'HOME'
   on it at Lovely Little Snippets and thought it would be a nice addition
   to the kits.  I was able to make 16 six inch blocks with one 2x3x8 that
   only cost $2 (that's .13 each for the wood).  I used black paint ($3
   Valspar paint sample from Lowe's), contact paper for a stencil, and
   added a piece of burlap and string from my stash.  If you would like
   more detailed directions on how to make the HOME block, directions can
   be printed here.
   [&#39;HOME&#39;+Block.jpg] [Wood+&#39;HOME&#39;+Block.jpg]
   I added a 'HOME' block to each kit, cut 1 sheet of tissue paper into
   four smaller squares (so it fit better), and they were done.  You could
   add another small item instead of the stenciled wood block to save time
   or just throw in the s'mores ingredients and leave it at that.
   [S&#39;mores+Kit+Holiday+Gift+Idea.jpg]
   Do you make small gifts for your neighbors and friends for the
   Holidays?  Are they done or are you scrambling to finish them too???

Hello and Goodbye

   Hello!  It's been awhile!  I can't believe that it's been over four
   months since my last post.  Crazy!  I thought I'd pop in and fill you
   in on what's been keeping me so busy for the last several months.  In
   the middle of March we listed our home, in mid April we accepted an
   offer, and by the middle of May we closed and moved most of our
   furniture, etc. into storage units.  We're currently in-between homes
   and staying with family until September when our new home will be ready
   for us, so all projects have pretty much come to a screeching halt.
   I've really missed not having a home to decorate!  I'm looking forward
   to posting some projects in the coming weeks though that I finished
   awhile ago but never shared with you, so it's all good. :)

     Photo of new little Lilac blooms in my backyard--one of my favorite
                                   things!

   I've never followed a set schedule with posting, I post when I have
   time and when I have something to share, so I'm pretty sure that most
   of you who read this blog follow via e-mail or through a reader.
   Now that we'll be saying Goodbye to Google Reader and Google Friend
   Connect this Monday I thought I'd share some other ways that you can
   read posts here on Today's Fabulous Finds--if you want too. :)
   Facebook--Updated with a direct link to each post.
   Feedly--I just checked Feedly out yesterday and I really like it so
   far!  I'm still working on getting a subscription button to work on my
   main page, but if you click on the link it will take you to the main
   Feedly page where you can sign up.
   Bloglovin'--Bloglovin' is new to me, so I haven't used it much, but it
   seems to be a popular replacement for Google Reader.
   Pinterest--All new projects will be posted on my Today's Fabulous Finds
   Board.
   Feedburner--Enter your e-mail and read posts via e-mail.  There is a
   subscription box on my sidebar.
   I haven't been able to be consistent with posting lately and it won't
   be consistent for awhile, but I'm not ready to give up on this blog
   yet!  Thanks for hanging in there with me and thanks so, so much for
   reading!!!

Dancing Monkey Gift Idea w/Printable Gift Bag Toppers

   The other day I was browsing around Dollar Tree and saw these little
   solar Monkeys (they had bears too).    I'm pretty sure I recall hearing
   my elementary school teachers telling the class "no more monkey
   business" a time or two so I thought it would be fun to pick up a few
   for my kids to give to their teachers for a Valentine's Day gift.
   [Dancing+Solar+Monkey+Valentine&#39;s+Day+Gift.jpg]
   Here's a little video of the dancing monkeys.
   You will need to click over to the actual post to view it if you are
   reading this post via e-mail or a reader.

   GMFskMtWZ4X76Y1PxG4eqrv-GnDE8z8c0XI9

   I gathered some cello sacks, a notepad and pen, green paper Easter
   grass, and some Hersheys Bliss and Dove Chocolates, packaged it all
   together and added a bag topper.  My kids wrote a little message on the
   notepad to their teachers to personalize them.

   [Teacher+Valentine+Gift+Idea.jpg]
   Here's a simpler version with just the Monkey and chocolates...
   [Small+Valentine+Gift+Idea.jpg]
   I brain-stormed for quite some time to come up with several different
   sayings and in the end, this is what I came up with.  What fun phrases
   did I miss?

   The image above can be printed as a 4 x 6 print and used for smaller
   gift tags.
   Click on this link for information on how to download the images.  All
   images are designed to be printed as 4 x 6 photo prints.  You will need
   to trim the sides down on the bag toppers to fit the top of the party
   size cello sacks.

   welcome to pin or feature any of the images above, but please do not
   post the original images below on your website, thanks! :)

   [All+Monkey+Business+Aside,+Happy+Valentine&#39;s+Day!.jpg]
   The name of the title font is called Janda Silly Monkey so of course I
   had to use it!
   If I was more on the ball I would have posted this two weeks ago
   instead of right on Valentine's Day. There are a few tags though that
   could be used anytime so this gift idea doesn't really have to be just
   for Valentine's Day.  Hope your day has been a good one!
