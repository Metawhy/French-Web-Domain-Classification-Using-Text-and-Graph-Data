France applies for the organisation of the 2026 International Congress of
Mathematicians

   Submitted by Insmi on Wed, 04/17/2019 - 11:35

   Each International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is the opportunity
   for the world mathematics community to come together and take stock of
   the most promising research perspectives of the moment. For sure, the
   human dimension of such an event is unmatched for mathematicians: an
   ICM is indeed one of the rare moments when all generations and all
   disciplines have the opportunity to exchange.
