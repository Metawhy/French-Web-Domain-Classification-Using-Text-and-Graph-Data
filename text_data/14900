Destination Wedding Photographer / London, Europe & Worldwide

   You've found an international award winning destination/luxury wedding
   photographer (covering the UK, Europe and the world), who genuinely
   cares. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the above slideshow collections.
   Looking to book? I'd love to hear from you.

Fine Art

   While part of a greater story, each photograph is treated as it's own
   piece of art. The elements of composition, framing, contrast,
   perspective and layers (to name but a few) are intuitively considered.
   Food for the soul.

Photojournalism

   There is great skill in telling the entire story in a single
   photograph. I take a photojournalistic approach to weddings, saving
   those moments that make the heart sing. Never obtrusively, always
   respectfully with the natural flow.

Naturally Unfolding

   Every wedding is entirely unique. I endeavour to capture that
   uniqueness as it naturally unfolds. No staged poses or smiles, only the
   preservation of genuine moments. The moments that really matter.

It's About Love

   Weddings celebrate the love between two people, their family and
   friends. That's where the true beauty is. Beauty that cannot be staged
   or faked. Beauty that is emotive, honest and precious.

Instinctive Approach

   I never attempt to apply a set formula to a wedding. Each is approached
   openly, instinctively and in the moment. Instincts that produce all the
   photographs you'll find on this website.

Always Creative

   I'm always - always - finding that magical moment, composition and
   style. In any situation. All day. Always in the zone. Every single
   moment can be captured artistically.

My Goal: Your Joy

   Creating a story that invokes joy is the most humbling and rewarding
   experience. It's what makes me tick, and one of the reasons I do not
   limit coverage. The other is a thank you for giving me the honour to
   document your day.

The Little Things

   Whether they are high-end or hand-made, I love the details of the day,
   which is why they always feature in the storyboards and albums. Couples
   put an enormous effort into their weddings, and I do the same in
   documenting them.

Genuine Care

   I'll help whenever I can, and I'll go out of my way to ensure you're
   happy. I won't go cold post-wedding either, Im always there. A rule I
   live by: treat people as you wish to be treated.

I'm Different

   I'm not the average wedding photographer. I don't take the same routine
   shots that most do. I strive to be different, to offer fresh, unique
   and artistically engaging photography.

A People Person

   I love people. I love to find out what makes them tick, to see them
   smile. I engage with wedding guests as it encourages them to relax
   around the camera, to open up and be themselves. Absolutely invaluable.

Efficiency is Key

   I understand the value in prompt communication, and endeavour to do so.
   I also appreciate that time is exceedingly valuable, which is why the
   storyboard is online after two weeks, and the full gallery in three.

Naturally Creative

   As a child I lived in my imagination, always drawing and doodling. My
   professional career before full time photography was in the creative
   design industry, contracted by global banks and network operators.

Technically Adept

   A Masters Degree in Advanced Computer Science compliments the creative
   side perfectly. I understand equipment and technology. No weak links in
   the process of capturing the photo to final delivery and secure backup.

Physically Ready

   Stamina is a vastly underestimated factor of wedding photography. For
   the best results, hour after hour, fitness is key. I keep myself in
   great health; mind, body and spirit. I'll be in the zone and full of
   energy all day and late into the night.

Problem Solver

   Multiple cameras, backups and equipment, along with the ability to work
   around restrictions (rain, for example), means that no matter the
   context or seeming limitation, the photographs are always of the
   highest calibre.
