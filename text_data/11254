About W. M. Keck Observatory

   The twin Keck Observatory telescopes are the world’s most
   scientifically productive optical and infrared telescopes. Each
   telescope weighs 300 tons and operates with nanometer precision. The
   telescopes’ primary mirrors are 10-meters in diameter and are each
   composed of 36 hexagonal segments that work in concert as a single
   piece of reflective glass. Keck Observatory is a 501(c)3 supported by
   both public funding sources and private philanthropy.  Learn more



   The Keck telescopes host a suite of state-of-the-art observing
   instruments and adaptive optics capabilities to collect and analyze
   astronomical data.
