Conference Sessions

   Most sessions are purely educational, with no promotional content
   allowed. Sponsored sessions allow presenters to use their own products
   in explaining their approach to addressing real-world problems.

Panel sessions

PDF as a Platform, the Challenge and the Prize

   Rick Treitman, Adobe Systems Entrepreneur in Residence, moderator

   Duff Johnson (PDF Association), Ivan Nincic (PDFTron), and John Hewson
   (PDFBox), panelists

   This panel and audience participation session asks the question: what
   needs to happen to move PDF from the ubiquitous lowest-common
   denominator to a platform for innovation? Rick will grill a couple of
   panelists, then open it up to the audience.

Who's afraid of XFA?

   Joel Geraci, Practical:PDF, moderator

   Bruno Lowagie, iText and Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe Systems, panelists

   What does the future hold for the XML Forms Architecture (XFA)?
   What are the pros and cons of the technology? How will deprecation from
   PDF 2.0 affect XFA? A discussion with experts in both PDF and XFA
   technologies.

PDF 2.0 and the future of PDF

   Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe Systems, moderator

   Duff Johnson (Consultant, ISO 32000 Project Leader), Bruno Lowagie,
   iText, Matt Kuznicki, Datalogics and François Fernandès, Levigo,
   panelists

   There are lots of changes coming in PDF 2.0. You probably have some
   questions. A panel of experts who are deeply involved with the ISO 171
   SC 2 WG 8 committee talk about the next big step in PDF technology

Educational sessions

   Educational sessions explain PDF technology at a variety of levels,
   from understanding the details of font encoding to the implementation
   of high-level abstractions about the nature of documents. These
   sessions are not in any way advertorials - there's no mention of
   products, just hard information delivered by some of the world's
   leading PDF technology developers.

PDF Compression: Ways to squeeze the most space from your PDF

   Aaron Schnarr / ActivePDF

   This session will discuss the image and object compression
   schemes available in the PDF specification, when and how to use them,
   as well as obvious and not so obvious ways to squeeze the most out of
   your PDF's.

XMP: Making metadata connect to your documents

   Aaron Schnarr / ActivePDF

   When is a document not just a document?  When it's an intelligent
   document!  You've probably heard about XMP and even seen it in your PDF
   files, but did you know that you can make XMP smart and even relate to
   real world data?  This session will cover strategies and techniques on
   creating, modifying and manipulating XMP so that it's not just "another
   thing to deal with", but instead, an integral part of your records
   management strategy.

Definitive PDF/A validation: why should developers care?

   Boris Doubrov / Dual Lab and Duff Johnson, PDF Association

   veraPDF architect (Boris) and industry coordinator (Duff) demonstrate
   the working prototype of the veraPDF consortiums EU-funded open source
   PDF/A validator project and discuss the possibilities of a world in
   which PDF documents can be authoritatively validated.

Intro to EPUB (for PDF developers)

   Bill McCoy / IDPF

   EPUB is a digital publication format based on HTML, CSS and other Web
   Standards that's been widely adopted for consumer ebooks and is seeing
   increasing adoption in other segments of publishing such as e-textbooks
   and other learning content. EPUB's focus is on structured content that
   can be reformatted for optimized display on different sized screens and
   for accessibility purposes, but EPUB now also supports fixed layout,
   forms and other interactivity, and is even being used in
   print-on-demand solutions. This session, presented by IDPF Executive
   Director Bill McCoy, will give an overview of EPUB's current technical
   capabilities and near-term roadmap, focusing on areas of
   complementarity as well as overlap with PDF which may present new
   opportunities for PDF developers.

ZUGFeRD: The e-invoice "cart horse" from Germany

   Bruno Lowagie / iText

   XML or PDF for invoices? It's not an "or" story. You can have the best
   of both worlds. Thanks to the ZUGFeRD standard, you can
   produce invoices that are user-friendly and machine-readable at the
   same time.

Implementing PDF/A-3 solutions

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   The PDF/A-3 specification (ISO 19005-3) allows for embedding arbitrary
   files as PDF attachments. The presentation will explain PDF/A-3?s
   technical requirements and provide the technical and environmental
   background to use cases in document management that take advantage of
   PDF/A-3.

What's coming in PDF 2.0

   Duff Johnson, PDF Association

   One of the two Project Leaders of the ISO committee developing ISO
   32000-2 will provide an overview of the additions, deprecations,
   clarifications and other changes in the first fully post-Adobe
   specification for PDF. This session is intended to provide background
   information for the panel discussion immediately following.

Intro to PDF/A

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   This session offers an introduction to the requirements and
   restrictions of the archival standard for PDF technology.

Understanding fonts and encodings

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   Trapped in the Bermuda triangle of font encoding, glyph lookup, and
   text extraction? Help is at hand!

Repairing and optimizing PDF files

   Hans Barfüss / PDF Tools

   If you can't open a PDF file because it is bad or damaged is an
   unpleasant experience. The presentation introduces the audience to the
   cause and the art of repairing damaged PDF files. Optimization is more
   than just compressing images and reducing the size of a PDF file. It
   can also be used to prepare a document for a specific purpose such as
   web publishing or printing. The presentation gives an overview of the
   most common optimization tasks.

Semantic content recognition in PDF, and what's next

   Ivan Nincic / PDFTron

   Semantic content recognition in PDF has many applications ranging from
   accessibility support to reflow, however current solutions fall short.
   After examining the state of the art in this area we provide some
   suggestions on how to advance the field.

Intro to PDF

   Leonard Rosenthol / Adobe Systems

   From PDF file structure to the Carousel Object System to common data
   structures and more, Adobe's PDF Architect introduces the technical
   infrastructure of the world's chosen final-form electronic document
   format.

Searching PDF: Challenges and Opportunities

   Leonard Rosenthol / Adobe Systems

   Searching PDF is hard. Or at least, it's harder than searching HTML.
   But speed of indexing is only one of many considerations. This session
   provides insight into why none of the search engine vendors do PDF
   search properly, and suggests some ways in which developers might
   choose to approach the problem.

Intro to PDF/UA

   Matthew Hardy / Adobe Systems

   This session introduces the core concepts of PDF's content reuse
   mechanism including marked content, logical structure and tagged PDF.

Tagging page content

   Matthew Hardy / Adobe Systems

   What are the considerations when writing or reading marked content,
   logical structure and tagged PDF? This session introduces developers to
   the nuts and bolts of reusing PDF content.

A history of concerns about PDF

   Matt Kuznicki / Datalogics

   Since its inception, PDF has been a reliable format for communicating
   and exchanging ideas with others. However, the world keeps changing 
   and with it, the needs, desires and concerns of users change as well.
   This talk will feature the history of various end-user and community
   concerns and opinions about the PDF file format throughout its lifetime
   (factual and unfounded), the motivations behind these concerns, and how
   these concerns have been addressed over time. Well wrap up with a
   discussion on how the PDF format is continuing to evolve, and what
   communities will benefit.

An introduction to color in PDF

   Patrick Gallot  / Datalogics

   Colors can be represented in a multitude of different ways in PDF
   files, with interesting results. This session will provide an
   introduction to color and how colors are represented in PDF files.
   We'll talk about how colors are processed for display and print of
   PDFs, how transparency affects color processing and best practices for
   specifying and processing color in PDFs.

Opportunities for PDF on mobile platforms

   Pat Wibbeler / Adobe Systems

   What are some of the interesting things one can do with PDF on a mobile
   device? From touch to offline work to embedded audio and video, PDF
   offers a variety of interesting opportunities for mobile developers.

Table cell extraction from PDF documents

   Malcolm Greaves, Research Engineer / Nitro

   The table cell extraction problem is central to understanding tabular
   data captured in PDFs. This talk will explain the underlying problem
   and describe a functional algorithm that given the boundaries of a
   well-formed table on a PDF page is able to accurately extract each
   cell¹s data and assign it a unique row and column header label. This
   approach can be used to derive a relational table of contents. Several
   other applications that are powered by a working table cell extraction
   algorithm will also be discussed.

Practical solutions in the real world (sponsored sessions)

   The "practical" sponsored sessions are all about exploring specific
   solutions. They may include product mentions and in most cases,
   demonstrations. There will be plenty of time left for questions.
   Presenters aren't sales/marketing people; these speakers are experts in
   their fields. Hard questions are encouraged!

Automating quality control in PDF generation and validation

   Boris Doubrov / Dual Lab

   Dual Lab is a software development company delivering high
   quality solutions in PDF technology, graphics arts and other
   technological areas.  In this session we talk about both our success
   stories and best practices as well as risks and concerns.

Using a RESTful API to Process PDF Forms

   Brandon Haugen / Datalogics

   It is challenging to provide a consistent experience when working with
   PDF forms, with different PDF viewers on different screens and
   platforms all offering differing support for PDF forms. How do you
   provide the best experience for your users, no matter how they work
   with your PDF form? Use a RESTful API with smarter PDFs. By offloading
   some of the logic that would normally go into an application into the
   PDF itself and using Datalogics PDF WebAPI to execute that logic when
   your users send the PDF back to you, you can build more flexible
   applications to handle your needs today and the needs of your users in
   the future.

Integrating PDF technology through command-line or SDK - what makes most
sense?

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   There is a tendency amongst developers to look down on
   command-line modules and favour integration through libraries. There
   are however advantages to using command-line integration of
   technologies and a thorough understanding of those advantages can help
   to make the right choice. With pdfaPilot and pdfToolbox, callas
   software provides both a command-line and library integration scenario.
   This presentation uses these technologies to highlight strengths and
   weaknesses of both approaches.

Programming PDF using web technologies and command line

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   In todays world communication very frequently happens through a mix of
   different channels: email, paper, web, etc. Web languages (HTML5, CSS3,
   JavaScript) have emerged as highly efficient technologies for dynamic
   content production but aren't necessarily ideal for variable data
   printing. Does it make sense to use web technologies for channels
   like PDF or print, which are using real pages with pagination,
   complex vector graphics, print color spaces? In this session,
   requirements and solutions are demonstrated with practical
   HTML/CSS/JavaScript examples that are converted using callas pdfChip;
   PDF creator technology that embraces web technologies without
   sacrificing the benefits of PDF.

PDF documents in HTML5 websites across devices

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   The jadice web toolkit is a GWT based library that provides consistent
   and reliable document viewing and more in HTML5 webpages. This session
   is about customizing the jadice web toolkit to create powerful document
   viewing clients.

Repairing and optimizing pdf files with PDF Tools

   Ulrich Altorfer / PDF Tools

   This session explains and demonstrates PDF Tools unique range of SDKs
   and applications designed to address the PDF repair and optimization
   needs as outlined in Hans Barfüsss educational session.

Introducing PDFNetJS: the first complete PDF toolkit for the browser

   James Borthwick / PDFTron

   Wouldn't it be great if all PDF processing like forms, annotations,
   rendering, file conversion, PDF/A validation, redaction and other
   editing operations could be done directly in any browser, without
   reliance on plugins or servers?

   Come and learn more about the future of PDF processing purely in the
   browser!

Transforming PDF into HTML

   Matt Kuznicki / Datalogics

   The fixed visual layout of PDF files is a key strength in many
   situations - however, this can also leave some users with a
   less-than-ideal experience. What to do in situations where PDF's
   strengths turn out to be weaknesses? Join us to learn about Datalogics
   PDF Alchemist and how to convert your PDF into HTML for presentation
   and repurposing PDF document content for a variety of purposes.

Tools that Drive the Digital Business

   Mike Kadell / ActivePDF

   As your business blurs the physical and digital worlds to create new,
   dynamic business models and designs, you need proven,
   reliable technology that increases revenue, decreases expenses and
   make regulatory and legal compliance much simpler.  With
   ActivePDF's developer tools and technologies you can quickly and easily
   digitize your business gaining a competitive advantage all while
   increasing your bottom line.

Creating structured PDF documents with iText

   Ryan Hamer / iText

   Some examples on how to use iText to create structured PDFs, building
   up to eventually creating ZUGFeRD invoices.

Understanding PDF at Web Scale

   Tiho Bajic, CTO / Nitro

   Pervasive new technologies, platforms, and consumer interactions
   have created the perfect storm of document inefficiency in
   organizations today. Difficulties in understanding and reasoning about
   unstructured data captured in PDFs is at the heart of this problem.
   Join Tiho Bajic, CTO of Nitro, as he examines the challenges of
   democratizing information captured in PDFs across the enterprise. Tiho
   will discuss the impact of emerging big and fast data technologies in
   working with documents at web scale.

Conference Sessions

   Most sessions are purely educational, with no promotional content
   allowed. Sponsored sessions allow presenters to use their own products
   in explaining their approach to addressing real-world problems.

Panel sessions

PDF as a Platform, the Challenge and the Prize

   Rick Treitman, Adobe Systems Entrepreneur in Residence, moderator

   Duff Johnson (PDF Association), Ivan Nincic (PDFTron), and John Hewson
   (PDFBox), panelists

   This panel and audience participation session asks the question: what
   needs to happen to move PDF from the ubiquitous lowest-common
   denominator to a platform for innovation? Rick will grill a couple of
   panelists, then open it up to the audience.

Who's afraid of XFA?

   Joel Geraci, Practical:PDF, moderator

   Bruno Lowagie, iText and Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe Systems, panelists

   What does the future hold for the XML Forms Architecture (XFA)?

   PDF 2.0 affect XFA? A discussion with experts in both PDF and XFA
   technologies.

PDF 2.0 and the future of PDF

   Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe Systems, moderator

   Duff Johnson (Consultant, ISO 32000 Project Leader), Bruno Lowagie,
   iText, Matt Kuznicki, Datalogics and François Fernandès, Levigo,
   panelists

   There are lots of changes coming in PDF 2.0. You probably have some
   questions. A panel of experts who are deeply involved with the ISO 171
   SC 2 WG 8 committee talk about the next big step in PDF technology

Educational sessions

   Educational sessions explain PDF technology at a variety of levels,
   from understanding the details of font encoding to the implementation
   of high-level abstractions about the nature of documents. These
   sessions are not in any way advertorials - there's no mention of
   products, just hard information delivered by some of the world's
   leading PDF technology developers.

PDF Compression: Ways to squeeze the most space from your PDF

   Aaron Schnarr / ActivePDF

   This session will discuss the image and object compression
   schemes available in the PDF specification, when and how to use them,
   as well as obvious and not so obvious ways to squeeze the most out of
   your PDF's.

XMP: Making metadata connect to your documents

   Aaron Schnarr / ActivePDF

   When is a document not just a document?  When it's an intelligent
   document!  You've probably heard about XMP and even seen it in your PDF
   files, but did you know that you can make XMP smart and even relate to
   real world data?  This session will cover strategies and techniques on
   creating, modifying and manipulating XMP so that it's not just "another
   thing to deal with", but instead, an integral part of your records
   management strategy.

Definitive PDF/A validation: why should developers care?

   Boris Doubrov / Dual Lab and Duff Johnson, PDF Association

   veraPDF architect (Boris) and industry coordinator (Duff) demonstrate
   the working prototype of the veraPDF consortiums EU-funded open source
   PDF/A validator project and discuss the possibilities of a world in
   which PDF documents can be authoritatively validated.

Intro to EPUB (for PDF developers)

   Bill McCoy / IDPF

   EPUB is a digital publication format based on HTML, CSS and other Web
   Standards that's been widely adopted for consumer ebooks and is seeing
   increasing adoption in other segments of publishing such as e-textbooks
   and other learning content. EPUB's focus is on structured content that
   can be reformatted for optimized display on different sized screens and
   for accessibility purposes, but EPUB now also supports fixed layout,
   forms and other interactivity, and is even being used in
   print-on-demand solutions. This session, presented by IDPF Executive
   Director Bill McCoy, will give an overview of EPUB's current technical
   capabilities and near-term roadmap, focusing on areas of
   complementarity as well as overlap with PDF which may present new
   opportunities for PDF developers.

ZUGFeRD: The e-invoice "cart horse" from Germany

   Bruno Lowagie / iText

   XML or PDF for invoices? It's not an "or" story. You can have the best
   of both worlds. Thanks to the ZUGFeRD standard, you can
   produce invoices that are user-friendly and machine-readable at the
   same time.

Implementing PDF/A-3 solutions

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   The PDF/A-3 specification (ISO 19005-3) allows for embedding arbitrary
   files as PDF attachments. The presentation will explain PDF/A-3?s
   technical requirements and provide the technical and environmental
   background to use cases in document management that take advantage of
   PDF/A-3.

What's coming in PDF 2.0

   Duff Johnson, PDF Association

   One of the two Project Leaders of the ISO committee developing ISO
   32000-2 will provide an overview of the additions, deprecations,
   clarifications and other changes in the first fully post-Adobe
   specification for PDF. This session is intended to provide background
   information for the panel discussion immediately following.

Intro to PDF/A

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   This session offers an introduction to the requirements and
   restrictions of the archival standard for PDF technology.

Understanding fonts and encodings

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   Trapped in the Bermuda triangle of font encoding, glyph lookup, and
   text extraction? Help is at hand!

Repairing and optimizing PDF files

   Hans Barfüss / PDF Tools

   If you can't open a PDF file because it is bad or damaged is an
   unpleasant experience. The presentation introduces the audience to the
   cause and the art of repairing damaged PDF files. Optimization is more
   than just compressing images and reducing the size of a PDF file. It
   can also be used to prepare a document for a specific purpose such as
   web publishing or printing. The presentation gives an overview of the
   most common optimization tasks.

Semantic content recognition in PDF, and what's next

   Ivan Nincic / PDFTron

   Semantic content recognition in PDF has many applications ranging from
   accessibility support to reflow, however current solutions fall short.
   After examining the state of the art in this area we provide some
   suggestions on how to advance the field.

Intro to PDF

   Leonard Rosenthol / Adobe Systems

   From PDF file structure to the Carousel Object System to common data
   structures and more, Adobe's PDF Architect introduces the technical
   infrastructure of the world's chosen final-form electronic document
   format.

Searching PDF: Challenges and Opportunities

   Leonard Rosenthol / Adobe Systems

   Searching PDF is hard. Or at least, it's harder than searching HTML.
   But speed of indexing is only one of many considerations. This session
   provides insight into why none of the search engine vendors do PDF
   search properly, and suggests some ways in which developers might
   choose to approach the problem.

Intro to PDF/UA

   Matthew Hardy / Adobe Systems

   This session introduces the core concepts of PDF's content reuse
   mechanism including marked content, logical structure and tagged PDF.

Tagging page content

   Matthew Hardy / Adobe Systems

   What are the considerations when writing or reading marked content,
   logical structure and tagged PDF? This session introduces developers to
   the nuts and bolts of reusing PDF content.

A history of concerns about PDF

   Matt Kuznicki / Datalogics

   Since its inception, PDF has been a reliable format for communicating
   and exchanging ideas with others. However, the world keeps changing 
   and with it, the needs, desires and concerns of users change as well.
   This talk will feature the history of various end-user and community
   concerns and opinions about the PDF file format throughout its lifetime
   (factual and unfounded), the motivations behind these concerns, and how
   these concerns have been addressed over time. Well wrap up with a
   discussion on how the PDF format is continuing to evolve, and what
   communities will benefit.

An introduction to color in PDF

   Patrick Gallot  / Datalogics

   Colors can be represented in a multitude of different ways in PDF
   files, with interesting results. This session will provide an
   introduction to color and how colors are represented in PDF files.
   We'll talk about how colors are processed for display and print of
   PDFs, how transparency affects color processing and best practices for
   specifying and processing color in PDFs.

Opportunities for PDF on mobile platforms

   Pat Wibbeler / Adobe Systems

   What are some of the interesting things one can do with PDF on a mobile
   device? From touch to offline work to embedded audio and video, PDF
   offers a variety of interesting opportunities for mobile developers.

Table cell extraction from PDF documents

   Malcolm Greaves, Research Engineer / Nitro

   The table cell extraction problem is central to understanding tabular
   data captured in PDFs. This talk will explain the underlying problem
   and describe a functional algorithm that given the boundaries of a
   well-formed table on a PDF page is able to accurately extract each
   cell¹s data and assign it a unique row and column header label. This
   approach can be used to derive a relational table of contents. Several
   other applications that are powered by a working table cell extraction
   algorithm will also be discussed.

Practical solutions in the real world (sponsored sessions)

   The "practical" sponsored sessions are all about exploring specific
   solutions. They may include product mentions and in most cases,
   demonstrations. There will be plenty of time left for questions.
   Presenters aren't sales/marketing people; these speakers are experts in
   their fields. Hard questions are encouraged!

Automating quality control in PDF generation and validation

   Boris Doubrov / Dual Lab

   Dual Lab is a software development company delivering high
   quality solutions in PDF technology, graphics arts and other
   technological areas.  In this session we talk about both our success
   stories and best practices as well as risks and concerns.

Using a RESTful API to Process PDF Forms

   Brandon Haugen / Datalogics

   It is challenging to provide a consistent experience when working with
   PDF forms, with different PDF viewers on different screens and
   platforms all offering differing support for PDF forms. How do you
   provide the best experience for your users, no matter how they work
   with your PDF form? Use a RESTful API with smarter PDFs. By offloading
   some of the logic that would normally go into an application into the
   PDF itself and using Datalogics PDF WebAPI to execute that logic when
   your users send the PDF back to you, you can build more flexible
   applications to handle your needs today and the needs of your users in
   the future.

Integrating PDF technology through command-line or SDK - what makes most
sense?

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   There is a tendency amongst developers to look down on
   command-line modules and favour integration through libraries. There
   are however advantages to using command-line integration of
   technologies and a thorough understanding of those advantages can help
   to make the right choice. With pdfaPilot and pdfToolbox, callas
   software provides both a command-line and library integration scenario.
   This presentation uses these technologies to highlight strengths and
   weaknesses of both approaches.

Programming PDF using web technologies and command line

   David van Driessche / Four Pees & Dietrich von Seggern / callas
   software

   In todays world communication very frequently happens through a mix of
   different channels: email, paper, web, etc. Web languages (HTML5, CSS3,
   JavaScript) have emerged as highly efficient technologies for dynamic
   content production but aren't necessarily ideal for variable data
   printing. Does it make sense to use web technologies for channels
   like PDF or print, which are using real pages with pagination,
   complex vector graphics, print color spaces? In this session,
   requirements and solutions are demonstrated with practical
   HTML/CSS/JavaScript examples that are converted using callas pdfChip;
   PDF creator technology that embraces web technologies without
   sacrificing the benefits of PDF.

PDF documents in HTML5 websites across devices

   François Fernandes / Levigo

   The jadice web toolkit is a GWT based library that provides consistent
   and reliable document viewing and more in HTML5 webpages. This session
   is about customizing the jadice web toolkit to create powerful document
   viewing clients.

Repairing and optimizing pdf files with PDF Tools

   Ulrich Altorfer / PDF Tools

   This session explains and demonstrates PDF Tools unique range of SDKs
   and applications designed to address the PDF repair and optimization
   needs as outlined in Hans Barfüsss educational session.

Introducing PDFNetJS: the first complete PDF toolkit for the browser

   James Borthwick / PDFTron

   Wouldn't it be great if all PDF processing like forms, annotations,
   rendering, file conversion, PDF/A validation, redaction and other
   editing operations could be done directly in any browser, without
   reliance on plugins or servers?

   Come and learn more about the future of PDF processing purely in the
   browser!

Transforming PDF into HTML

   Matt Kuznicki / Datalogics

   The fixed visual layout of PDF files is a key strength in many
   situations - however, this can also leave some users with a
   less-than-ideal experience. What to do in situations where PDF's
   strengths turn out to be weaknesses? Join us to learn about Datalogics
   PDF Alchemist and how to convert your PDF into HTML for presentation
   and repurposing PDF document content for a variety of purposes.

Tools that Drive the Digital Business

   Mike Kadell / ActivePDF

   As your business blurs the physical and digital worlds to create new,
   dynamic business models and designs, you need proven,
   reliable technology that increases revenue, decreases expenses and
   make regulatory and legal compliance much simpler.  With
   ActivePDF's developer tools and technologies you can quickly and easily
   digitize your business gaining a competitive advantage all while
   increasing your bottom line.

Creating structured PDF documents with iText

   Ryan Hamer / iText

   Some examples on how to use iText to create structured PDFs, building
   up to eventually creating ZUGFeRD invoices.

Understanding PDF at Web Scale

   Tiho Bajic, CTO / Nitro

   Pervasive new technologies, platforms, and consumer interactions
   have created the perfect storm of document inefficiency in
   organizations today. Difficulties in understanding and reasoning about
   unstructured data captured in PDFs is at the heart of this problem.
   Join Tiho Bajic, CTO of Nitro, as he examines the challenges of
   democratizing information captured in PDFs across the enterprise. Tiho
   will discuss the impact of emerging big and fast data technologies in
   working with documents at web scale.
