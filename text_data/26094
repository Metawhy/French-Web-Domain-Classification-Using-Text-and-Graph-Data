      (Hint: It may be easier to print all of the cards if you set the
               printer for "landscape" instead of "portrait".)

                      Critical and Indispensable Rules

   Actually you make them up! It is much more fun that way. Okay I'll give
   you some suggestions of how I
   torture my victims,... I mean students. First: each card has a who or
   what category. This is the central feature.
   All the other words on the cards are hints or characteristics of that
   person or thing. So you can set the whole class
   on, for instance, say: fortune telling. Create a meaning for when you
   have an upside-down Hagrid, then a Draco, plus a Hogwarts Express. Get
   the entire class to write the definitive Sibyll Trelawney Divination
   Book. Each card has
   some facet of the future attached to it. Loads of fun and they really
   like to do it.

   Tearing or Origami Paper: I give the student a blank piece of and they
   have to tear or fold the paper in such a way that their team or partner
   guesses the word. When I'm feeling really mean I do the same thing with
   modeling clay.

   Draw it: (a classic) get them to go up to the blackboard or whiteboard
   and sketch away till their team says the right word. This is usually
   very noisy and is a great way to annoy Math teachers.

   Charades: need I say more?

   Sounds and Gestures: This is a variation of Charades where no words are
   allowed but lots of strange sounds and odd movements are encouraged.
   This has been known to completely alienate school directors. Use it if
   you're quitting teaching or have found a better job elsewhere.

   Hints: The object is to give a one word tip to determine the who or
   what category. You can stick to just the other words on that same card
   or let the students make up their own. This is usually done with two
   teams going at the same time and points are higher for the least clues
   given. If the class is not chaotic enough have two or more separate
   games going on at the same time.

   Wizard's Poker: Hey there's sixteen cards to a suit. That must make
   some interesting wild cards or rules.

   The Inquisition: The student has to form questions to make his or her
   group guess the word. Example: Levitate
   Question: "What does a hot air balloon do?" Or Sirus Black; "Who is
   Harry's Godfather?" This works well with weaker groups and helps them
   form questions correctly. Besides, It gives you something to do.

   Let me know if think up some other ways. You might checkout Sci-Fi
   Charades which is the basis for this game.

   Now remember this site is for English Teachers especially English as a
   Second Language or Teachers in K12 who would like to use the Wizarding
   World to teach Reading. SO... if you know a Quasi-Muggle like THAT,
   take them here, ah, please.

    HP TOEIC Reading: 131-140 Teacher's Notes:

   131. D. anyone
   (hint: English does not like double negatives, this eliminates no one
   and nobody and generally requires the form any) Somebody is not really
   improper English, however it is not the broadest scope and the experts
   who create the TOEIC would prefer anyone. Using somebody might give the
   impression that the cup is given only to important persons.

   132. A. Badly,
   Stiffly? it is a little hard for "things to go" rigidly, same for
   soundly which means firmly or even worse for slightly meaning to a
   small degree.

   133. C. had seen,
   A. seen is missing part of the tense B. sees is present tense and he
   "won" at cards D "will see" works for me if we are talking
   clairvoyance.

   134. D. might
   A. much has to do with amount, B. ought needs "to" to be added to make
   it correct, perhaps is not a verb

   135. A. resinded (which means take back) or C. cut off
   B. close out means to excluded D. turned off means extinguish

   136 . B. could
   (likely and if are not verbs!)

   137. B. enrollment is a noun the rest are verbs

   138. C. "to" otherwise follow is not an infinitive.

   139. C Before
   forewards is a direction, prematurely means before you should or want,
   soon is a near in time.

   140. B. share
   look, think and even reckon need something to connect them to the rest
   of the phrase i.e.: "look at" , "think about" or "reckon with"
   (even then reckon with would not work well)
