The 3rd International Moon Village Workshop & Symposium is happening in

   Tickets are now on sale
   Moon Village Association

   The concept of a "Moon Village" is the ensemble of all efforts from
   private, governmental and others, aiming to explore and use the moon in
   a sustainable manner. It is not a literal village on the moon, it is
   not an “International Space Station on the moon” and it is not a single
   science facility.

   “月球村”这一理念集合了私人、政府等各方的努力，旨在以可持续的方式探索和利用月球。它既不是一个字面意义上的村落，也不是“一个月球上的国际空间站
   ”，更不是一个单一的科学设施。

   Moon Village Association

About

The Moon Village Association (MVA) has been recently created as
non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Vienna. Its goal is the creation
of a permanent global informal forum for stakeholders like governments,
industry, academia and the public interested in the development of the Moon
Village. The MVA fosters cooperation for existing or planned global moon
exploration programs, be they public or private initiatives. It comprises
approximately 220 members from more than 39 countries and 25 Institutional
members around the globe, representing a diverse array of technical,
scientific, cultural and interdisciplinary fields.

MVA partners with non-space organizations to promote international
discussions and formulation of plans to foster the implementation of the Moon
Village and is creating international, national and regional networks to
engage civil society around the world.

Objectives

   The Moon Village Association was founded as a
   Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), registered in Vienna in 2017 with
   the aim of fostering the realization of the Moon Village.

   The Moon Village being global by definition needs to be brought on the
   political agenda of as many national governments and private sector
   organizations as possible. This task requires communication of the Moon
   Village with all major parts of the society with the goal of engaging
   them in its implementation. The Moon Village Association provides a
   platform and takes actions supporting communications and cooperation
   among all elements of the human society vis-à-vis the Moon Village,
   including both space-faring and not space-faring countries and offers
   them the opportunity to play a role in its realization.

   There is no other organization on the international scene having such a
   mission.

   The political implications and importance of the Moon Village demands
   of necessity that it involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders beyond
   the usual space community: including the industrial and financial
   sectors, the scientific community, media, the entertainment sector, the
   artistic and literary communities, educators, and others.

   However, first and foremost the MVA establishes relations with those
   who are, or plan to be active participants in the exploration,
   development and eventual settlement of the Moon. They include leading
   space agencies working in cooperation (e.g., ISECG, ISEF, ILEWG) on
   various specific programs for lunar exploration, as well as private
   companies investing in lunar technology. These programs and
   plans provide the most concrete arguments to be employed in convincing
   society and diverse decision-makers of the expected benefits that may
   result from implementation of the Moon Village concept. At the same
   time, the MVA represents a network helping to build relationships among
   space and non-space actors to make their mutual communication more
   efficient and results more successful.

   In particular, the MVA seeks to:
     * Consolidate a compelling shared vision of the Moon Village that
       fosters a sense of belonging and inspires a group of people to
       create it together.
     * Support the creation of a new open dynamic that includes ideas from
       space agencies, commercial space, donors, philanthropists, and
       citizens from all countries.
     * Stimulate global awareness of the prospective benefits of the Moon
       Village, with arguments about how individuals, countries, regions,
       and the environment will benefit from establishing a permanent
       presence on and near the Moon.
     * Facilitate discussions with financial industry experts and entities
       with the goal of establishing the necessary financial means to
       support the development of the Moon Village and associated economic
       activities.
     * Create a paradigm shift in how international space missions are
       being designed – toward faster, lower cost, more creative and
       collaborative approaches.
     * Foster the Moon Village vision to society at large to engage
       citizen worldwide.
     * Act as a representative of the civil society and international
       space community in the decision-making process which is assessing
       or related to the Moon Village concept.

Features

   Hereafter are the main features of the Moon Village Association:
     * Neutral: Politically neutral, which means that no organization or
       country will have a predominant role in opportunity to participate
       in formulation of the Moon Village concept.
     * Global: Global endeavor that aims to promote the participation from
       as many countries as possible, including those countries who do not
       have the budget to contribute with hardware to the MVA but that can
       contribute with ideas, capacity building, and awareness efforts.
     * Inclusive: It is inclusive of all disciplines from scientific to
       humanistic. It endorses a holistic approach to the next giant step
       of Humankind.
     * Cooperative: It seeks to avoid duplication of efforts with other
       stakeholders like Space Agencies and industries, but encourages
       creation of synergies on all Moon-related topics by providing a
       forum among all stakeholders.
     * Not formal: Participation is largely informal, meaning that
       governments and Space Agencies can join with an in-kind
       contribution only, and no requirement for a formal ratification of
       activities or need to elaborate official policy positions.
     * Consensus building: Will help to create a consensus on different
       topics. For example, by reaching an agreement on a standard for
       Moon mission’s communication or rule of cooperation without any
       formal bilateral agreements by the stakeholders.
     * Participative: Open to all stakeholders including the public. The
       public has always been excluded in the creation and implementation
       of space programs. The MVA aims to involve the public in the
       definition of the MVA by creating awareness and opening the
       possibility for individuals to join in.
     * Autonomous: Funded via individual and institutional membership and
       also through the sponsorship of events.
     * Unique Platform: Similar platforms exist, but are mainly thematic
       organizations like the LEAG (Lunar Exploration Advisory Council),
       which are mainly scientific as well as others involving space
       agencies (i.e. ISECG, ISEF, ILEWG) but none of those have a ‘all in
       one’ approach.

About

   The Moon Village Association (MVA) has been recently created as
   non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Vienna. Its goal is the
   creation of a permanent global informal forum for stakeholders like
   governments, industry, academia and the public interested in the
   development of the Moon Village. The MVA fosters cooperation for
   existing or planned global moon exploration programs, be they public or
   private initiatives. It comprises of approximately 220 members from
   more than 39 countries and 25 Institutional members around the globe,
   representing a diverse array of technical, scientific, cultural and
   interdisciplinary fields.

   MVA partners with non-space organizations to promote international
   discussions and formulation of plans to foster the implementation of
   the Moon Village and is creating international, national and regional
   networks to engage civil society around the world.
