Privacy-Safe Digital Identity Resolution

Privacy-Safe Digital Identity Resolution

   OPT OUT

Where being privacy-first is paramount

   Protecting consumer privacy has been paramount to Tapad since the
   creation of our company. Our goal is to ensure that every consumer is
   empowered to make an informed decision about what information is
   collected and how it is used by Tapad.

   Over the years, Tapad has invested significant resources into being a
   privacy-first company. As a long-standing member of the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI) and Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),
   Tapad has been a participant in self-regulatory programs and has
   adhered to privacy best practices since its inception. From ensuring
   compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the
   EU, to preparing for compliance with the forthcoming California
   Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US, Tapad has scaled many of these
   initiatives to all aspects of data processing across all regions.

   What does this mean?
     * Ongoing commitment to transparency, user control, and user privacy
       by providing full disclosure as to how data is collected, processed
       and stored
     * Membership in self-regulatory organizations such as the Network
       Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance
       (DAA) and About EDAA - European Interactive Digital Advertising
       Alliance (eDAA), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tapad
       is a registered global vendor with the IAB EU Transparency and
       Consent a Framework which aims to help publishers, advertisers and
       technology companies comply with key elements of the GDPR.
     * Clear and easy opt-out choices through Tapad’s site, or centralized
       industry opt-outs through the NAI and DAA
     * Implementing Privacy-by-Design and Data Minimization principles
       throughout the product development processes which include:
          + Not collecting data when there is no present commercial need
          + Limiting data retention to the minimum amount needed for the
            purposes of usage
          + Utilizing automatic expiration of data sets
          + Implementing technical safeguards to not ingest data that
            whose source is unknown or data that is unnecessary.
     * Ongoing formal Privacy Impact Assessments for all key products

     * Standardized diligence process for all partners and clients to
       ensure all data processing and collection are in compliance with
       relevant regulations and best practices
     * Process for response to data subject requests such as the right to
       access and erasure

   page here or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Opt-out page here. If
   you reside in Europe, you may also opt out from the European Digital
   Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page here, which is available in 27

   applications, please download the DAA’s AppChoices tool for your mobile
   operating system and opt-out through the application.
