   J. Porche., New Bedford, MA

     My father had used this company years ago and regarded them
     favorably. I have had a dozen Harvey windows installed on two
     occasions…..Each time, I was completely satisfied by the
     disciplined, efficient and rapid install…A great experience.

   James L. New Bedford, MA

     Dana was a very good representative of their company. He wasn’t
     pushy and explained everything well. He did an excellent job and so
     did the installation crew.
