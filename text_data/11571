Tobias Rehberger’s 24-Stop Walk

A Guest Feature by Marco Sammicheli

   >

   Close to Basel, the so-called Rehberger Way connects the Beyeler
   Foundation in the Swiss village Riehen to the Vitra Campus in Weil am
   Rhein in Germany. This is a walk that links two countries and offers a
   unique experience surrounded by nature and art, with 24 objects - 24
   stops – along the way created by the German artist Tobias Rehberger.

   Anything designed in the outdoor environment is by its very nature both
   public and private. In catering to the demands of a community it
   considers the needs of the individual, which might for example be a
   park bench. And to serve the individual it places itself in a wider
   context, even if that involves something as simple as a terrace. It
   also has to be made of heavy-duty, weather-proof materials and comply
   with strict safety standards, as well as having appeal, so that people
   actually want to use it. These are the factors a designer must take
   into account particularly when called upon to design something as
   clearly defined as stopping points on an out-of-town itinerary.

   [16324052.jpg]
   [16406035.jpg]
   [16405884.jpg]

   History is full of examples of this kind of space, from the waystages
   on medieval pilgrim trails to modern motorway service stations, filling
   stations and the more recent cases of Alessandro Mendini’s tram stops
   in Hannover, David Chipperfield’s work for the public transport system
   in Milan and Jasper Morrisonʼs bus stop in Weil am Rhein on the 55 bus
   line to Basel.
   "The markers along the way are designed to attract people’s attention
   with colour and form used to give them a magnetic, alien quality in the
   landscape."
   Tobias Rehberger

   The Fondation Beyeler, the municipalities of Riehen and Weil am Rhein
   and Vitra have now focused on this area in a joint project, and have
   decided to involve an artist with plenty of experience creating objects
   in a spatial context. Tobias Rehberger was commissioned to design 24
   waymarkers along a footpath connecting the Beyeler Foundation with the
   Vitra Campus. The walk, which has been named the Rehberger-Weg,
   connects two municipalities, crosses a national border and winds its
   way through the countryside between two towns. It starts from the area
   in front of the Swiss museum Fondation Beyeler, designed by Renzo
   Piano, crosses a river, immerses walkers in countryside filled with
   orchards and eventually arrives at the industrial campus where the last
   stop, at Frank Gehry’s Vitra Design Museum is a fluorescent bell.

   "Abitare" met the German artist in his Frankfurt studio, a space on two
   levels with a workshop and warehouse on the banks of the river Main.
   "My idea," he explains, "was to turn simple elements showing the way
   into a system that would give a whole new meaning to the space and give
   extra value to the walking experience. For this reason I didn’t make
   use of typography, I wasn’t trying to express any kind of message – I
   just wanted to create something that would inspire visitors to go on a
   walking tour. The markers along the way are designed to attract
   people’s attention," Rehberger goes on, "with colour and form used to
   give them a magnetic, alien quality in the landscape: unnatural
   geometric presences. Although some of the markers do draw on certain
   typologies, I wanted each of them to perform a function of abstraction,
   to be a personal interpretation of the existing context, marking the
   transition from hidden to explicit."
   >
   >

   The focus on the process of perception – a recurrent theme in the work
   of the German artist – takes place in this specific case through the
   metaphor of the marker pointing the way to walkers. Whether it is a
   sculpture, an artwork on a wall or on the ground, an aerial
   installation or any other kind of object, each stopping place is the
   outcome of interaction between the typical demands made of public art
   when it becomes urban furnishing and the artist’s own poetics. “I
   worked around the themes of borders, of the cognitive and perceptive
   efforts involved in art and design, of function and autonomy, and of
   Swiss and German identity."
   >
   >

   "I was interested in the ambiguity of the two centres, in the
   generation of contradictions and in the different levels of
   interpretation," Rehberger says. "I have always been suspicious of my
   ways of seeing things," he concludes, with a smile. "The aim of this
   project was to work on the fears people have about art, establishing a
   relationship with those who have not been taught to appreciate
   contemporary creativity and turning my attention to non-specialists."

   The project "24 Stops" was commissioned by the cultural institutions at
   its two extremities and the municipalities of Weil am Rhein in Germany
   and Riehen in Switzerland, and realized with the Swiss watch
   manufacturer Swatch. The walk can be done independently or as a guided
   tour. To get to stop number ten – Artwork on the Ground – walkers need
   to produce identity documents to be allowed to cross into the other
   country. The project is linked to the IBA Basel 2020 international
   initiative, whose aim is to set up cooperation schemes in this
   particular part of Europe where France, Switzerland and Germany meet.
   The open-air Rehberger-Weg initiative has a website with a map that can
   be downloaded, a smartphone app and an instagram account.

The Visionary

Thoughts on Victor Papanek

>

   1.

   Design is more than just the creation of a physical object. Design is a
   process that ideally makes our world a little bit better. Today this
   idea seems perfectly normal, but it owes much to the influence of
   Victor Papanek. Now on display at the Vitra Design Museum, the
   exhibition ‘Victor Papanek – The Politics Of Design’ presents the work
   and legacy of a man who was more than just a designer. A text by Jochen
   Overbeck.
   ‘Be it an automobile jack or space station, it has to work, and work
   optimally at that.’ Victor Papanek wrote this statement for a 1968
   essay in the magazine of the Scandinavian Design Students’ Organization
   (SDO), and subsequently included a slightly modified version in Design
   for the Real World, the book that established Papanek’s reputation as
   one of the most important designers of the twentieth century. The
   statement may seem like a platitude, but it isn’t. First of all, each
   of us has encountered products that do not last long. The electric
   kettle whose handle breaks off after just one year. The cell phone
   cable that doesn’t charge anymore. Even more consequential is the fact
   that design so often fails to meet human needs. The mug with a handle
   so small you cannot even hold it. The plastic packaging that can only
   be opened with brute force. The airplane seat which is an instrument of
   torture for anyone over 1.75 metres in height. Papanek penned another
   statement that also comes to mind here: ‘There are professions more
   harmful than industrial design, but only a few of them.’
   2.
   3.

   As the first major retrospective on the Austrian-American designer,
   ‘Victor Papanek – The Politics Of Design’ is sure to elicit one thing
   during its run at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein: a lively
   and provocative discourse about a profession that is all too often
   misunderstood and too seldom challenged.
   Victor Papanek was born in Vienna in 1923. In 1939, he emigrated to the
   United States and obtained U.S. citizenship in the 1940s. After
   completing high school, he studied architecture and design and then
   worked for several years in the office of Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1946,
   he founded his own company, the Design Clinic, and created small
   furnishings that reflect the spirit of the times but are still
   compelling today – such as the Carry About Table, a small side table
   with a central handle for lifting, the striking Samisen Chair or the
   Hearth Group, a complete interior for a small apartment. The main
   target group for these early works: small families and soldiers
   returning from the war.
   [36808687.jpg]
   [36808513.jpg]
   [36808698.jpg]
   [36808454.jpg]
   [36808502.jpg]
   [36808709.jpg]

   ^4 - 9.
   However, Papanek’s idea of what design should achieve quickly changed,
   partly due to the influence of his contemporaries. In 1951, Marshall
   McLuhan’s The Mechanical Bride was published, in which the media
   theorist examined the effects of advertising and entertainment on the
   populace. The architect Richard Neutra, like Papanek an immigrant from
   Vienna, formulated a holistic design approach three years later in his
   book Survival Through Design. In the same year Papanek met Richard
   Buckminster Fuller, who became a role model as well as a friend. Soon
   Papanek, too, began teaching.
   10.
   11.

   Papanek’s design approach, which had always combined a certain
   smartness with more practical considerations, increasingly took on a
   theoretical foundation. In a 1957 essay, he wrote that a designer must
   be a ‘communicator and diplomat’. Starting in 1961, he moderated the
   television programme ‘Design Dimension’, for which he drafted a series
   of clear tenets, such as ‘A Designer Appreciates Nature’ or ‘A Designer
   Uses Technology’. Papanek’s work from that period reflects this
   shifting emphasis. At North Carolina State College, he and his students
   developed one of the first humanitarian aid tents, followed by such
   things as play equipment for children with cerebral palsy and a
   handicapped-accessible taxi. The internationally recognised wheelchair
   icon was created in one of Papanek’s university courses. He became a
   pioneer of what is now known as ‘social design’. Incidentally, such
   work can be quite fun: the tent-like play tunnel found in children’s
   rooms all over the world is another Papanek design.
   12.
   13.

   In the exhibition, these details are not only traced in a timeline, but
   also put in the context of their respective era. We see Papanek’s own
   sketches, posters and books – with the bestseller Design for the Real
   World in all its translations taking centre stage in one room, where
   visitors can even leaf through some of the editions – as well as the
   work of his contemporaries. The latter include McLuhan or Ralph Nader,
   who plunged the American auto industry into a crisis in 1965 with his
   seminal work "Unsafe At Any Speed". Design objects are presented in a
   similar manner. Initially focused on Papanek, the exhibition’s
   perspective broadens as visitors move from one gallery to the next,
   zooming in on the surrounding context.
   By the time viewers reach the upper level of the museum, which features
   a large installation by the Argentine artist Tomás Saraceno, they have
   firmly arrived in the present, with one foot extended toward the
   future. Here the exhibition curators expand the concept of design,
   applying Papanek’s thoughts to contemporary problems. ‘Can technology
   save us?’ reads one question, illustrated by a project in Syria under
   the auspices of the Forensic Architecture research agency. The group
   reconstructs war crimes with the aid of witness statements, videos and
   images from social media, generating evidence to bring the perpetrators
   to justice. Fernando Laposse hews more closely to the traditional
   design concept: his project ‘Totomoxtle’ salvages heirloom varieties of
   Mexican maize. A group of Mexican restaurant chefs is involved in the
   project, but the main protagonists are local women who dry and smooth
   the husks of the plants before processing them into a veneer-like
   material. This is design that does no harm. On the contrary. This is
   design that serves the common good – and a perfect example of Papanek’s
   ideals.

About Charles and Ray

Interview with Curator Jolanthe Kugler

   >

   ‘An Eames Celebration’ is on show at the Vitra Design Museum until 25
   February 2018. Four parallel exhibitions on the Vitra Campus provide
   insights into the work of Charles and Ray Eames, offering the most
   comprehensive presentation to date on the American designer couple. We
   spoke with curator Jolanthe Kugler.

The furniture, films, books, exhibitions and media installations of Charles
and Ray Eames have influenced generations of designers and continue to shape
our everyday culture. As a curator, how do you deal with such a wide-ranging
oeuvre; how do you conceptually approach the task of mounting a
retrospective?

   The first step is to view the material, to do archival research, to
   read and talk with experts. Once we had gathered all this information,
   we decided to focus on certain aspects – in regard to both content and
   location. We are showing a sweeping overview at four different venues
   on the Vitra Campus: the main exhibition “Charles & Ray Eames: The
   Power of Design”, which was conceived by Catherine Ince with her team
   from the Barbican Art Gallery and adapted by the Vitra Design Museum
   for the current presentation, and three smaller thematic highlights at
   other sites on the Campus. In the process of preparing the exhibitions,
   what we essentially had already known was reaffirmed: Charles and Ray
   Eames are among the most important creative figures of the twentieth
   century. Assisted by a group of talented employees, the Eames made
   pioneering achievements in numerous fields. But above all, they became
   world famous for their furniture designs, encompassing over 100
   different models.
   >
   >

What was the social context surrounding the work of Charles and Ray?

   The first half of the twentieth century was a period of radical social
   transformation accompanied by a corresponding shift in human needs. In
   every area of society, conventional norms were challenged or even cast
   aside. Architects rejected the tenets of Classicism and painters
   abandoned the representational depiction of a supposedly objective
   reality. Photography revealed a novel reality, and the medium of film
   brought insightful knowledge about light, shadow, spatial images and
   motion. And then an entirely new aesthetic vocabulary emerged along
   with the development of cars, aeroplanes and technical devices. Women
   were allowed to attend university and pursue a career, while people
   became more mobile. Families grew smaller, and so did their homes. All
   of this altered the functions and requirements of domestic interiors,
   and the aim of the Eames was to provide solutions for these changing
   needs.
   >
   >

Charles and Ray were a married couple and – something which was uncommon
during that period – pursued a joint career. How would you describe their
working relationship?

   Their collaboration was as fruitful as it was unusual for the time in
   which they lived. They were partners and companions in both life and
   work, uniting Ray’s artistically trained eye, her understanding of
   conceptual thinking, structural connections and consistent design
   principles with Charles’ technical skills, manual dexterity and his
   passion for experimentation.The uniqueness of their partnership is not
   just a factor of having created many different things – and all on the
   highest possible level – but lies even more in their consistent,
   coherent approach to an extremely diverse range of problems. Every
   individual task was viewed by both of them from numerous perspectives,
   artistic as well as technical, social as well as economic – and the
   solution had to provide a satisfactory answer on all fronts.
   >

One of the exhibitions is exclusively devoted to the theme of toys. Why were
the Eames so fascinated by masks, kites, puzzles, cards and construction
kits?

   During playful activities, children – or adults – learn to perceive and
   comprehend the world around them. This strong conviction of Charles and
   Ray forms the basis of the exhibition “Play Parade” in the Vitra Design
   Museum Gallery. Playing facilitates an unbiased and open-minded
   observation of the world, while nurturing one’s imagination and
   creativity. The Eames applied this ‘playful’ approach to all of their
   projects. Our presentation features toys and short films by the Eames
   as well as objects from their own toy collection in a room-filling
   installation. It is an exhibition where visitors of all ages can make
   discoveries, experiment and participate.

About the Exhibitions

   The focal point of the exhibition sequence ‘An Eames Celebration’ on
   the Vitra Campus is the major retrospective “Charles & Ray Eames: The
   Power of Design”, which is on display in the main building of the Vitra
   Design Museum. In the Fire Station, a selection from the Eames’
   cinematic oeuvre of more than 100 films is presented under the title
   “Ideas and Information: The Eames Films”. In the Vitra Design Museum
   Gallery, the exhibition “Play Parade: An Eames Exhibition for Children”
   invites visitors to discover and try out the many toys created by the
   husband-and-wife team. Finally, the Vitra Schaudepot features the
   exhibition “Kazam! The Furniture Experiments of Charles & Ray Eames”.
   Just in time for the 110th birthday of Charles Eames, the Eames
   Collection held by the Vitra Design Museum is also being introduced in
   its full scope. Along with production models, it encompasses a
   significant part of Charles and Ray Eames’ own furniture archive. These
   objects have been in the holdings of the Vitra Design Museum since 1988
   and include a large portion of the prototypes and experimental models
   developed in the Eames Office.More information on the topic of Eames
   furniture is found in the "Eames Furniture Sourcebook", a new
   publication by the Vitra Design Museum, available in German and English
   editions from booksellers or directly from the VDM publishing house.

A Manifesto for Colours

'Breathing Colour' in London

   >

   ‘Breathing Colour’ is the title of Hella Jongerius’ latest exhibition,
   which is currently on show at the London Design Museum. It is an
   investigation of the Dutch designer’s theories and concepts about
   colour, illustrating such phenomena as the relationship between colour
   and light over the course of a day. In the Vitra Magazine, Hella
   Jongerius shares some of her thoughts on the project.

   "Colour touches so many different aspects of design: words, shapes,
   materials, physics, space, light. The experience of colour is
   completely dependent on its physical, visual, artistic and cultural
   context. What is the relationship between form and colour? When does a
   colour lift up a shape and give it a new dimension? What is the role of
   shadow?
   >
   >

   Colours change in the course of a day. The morning brings us light and
   light brings us colour. Light starts low and gradually rises. The cold
   air creates a crystal clear glow with a bluish hue. Morning tones are
   pastel-coloured – soft but fresh, with less yellow and no black. There
   is a visible distinction between lightness and brightness. Diffuse
   morning light has a hazy feel but at the same time some bright
   reflections. Light starts low and moves upward, shadows are misty.
   Translucent becomes opaque. Shapes come into being, material becomes
   form – coloured light reflections.
   [24082193.jpg]

   [24082261.jpg]
   [24082202.jpg]
   [24082184.jpg]

   Then comes the sharp noontime light from directly above, bringing very
   strong contrasts and structure. Colours look greener and take on a more
   reddish tone. When the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, the
   light intensity reaches its climax and brings brightly saturated
   colours to life. Sharp shadows create a powerful contrast with the
   energetic hues.
   I have used Colour Catchers to visualize this. They are an abstraction
   of all the daily objects that surround me and the ultimate shapes for
   researching colour, shadows and reflections. They are my canvases.
   [24076844.jpg]
   [24079075.jpg]
   [24081811.jpg]

   In the evening, when the light is clouded with air pollution, black
   starts to mix into the hues, making them more passive. The forms throw
   shadows. A mystic world arises, where shapes merge with shadows in a
   whole range of blacks. We present a black still life where absorption
   and shadows become visible. Here we test our scotopic vision – the
   visual adaptation to environments during the night. The exhibition
   shows existing objects, and study tools, to reveal more about
   absorption of the different shades of black.
   >
   >

   With this exhibition, I want to make a plea for colours that breathe. I
   still have the impression of being an absolute novice when it comes to
   colour. Even though I have already learned a great deal, I still can’t
   really get my head around the subject. Colour is one of those truly
   wonderful topics that will always keep you feeling like a beginner. It
   is this quality that makes colour so worthwhile – just like life
   itself."
