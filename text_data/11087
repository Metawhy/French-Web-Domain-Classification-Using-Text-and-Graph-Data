How one man turned Israel's Gaza blockade into a business opportunity

   Ahmed Ramlawy's plastics company survived Israel's Gaza blockade by
   buying garbage at $395 a ton and turning it into products all Gazans
   need, like trash bags.

   Gaza City, Gaza

   At the end of an alley in Gaza City’s Tofah neighborhood, an industrial
   ghost town full of quiet factories and unused warehouses, sits the
   Ramlawy Plastics Company.

   The factory once hummed with the activity of 45 workers turning raw
   Israeli plastics into bags, storage containers, bottles, and pipes.
   Manager Ahmed Ramlawy says that in those days they made fat profit
   margins of 20 percent.

   Those were "the good days," he says, before Israel imposed an economic
   blockade on Gaza when Hamas took control of the territory in 2007 after
   a brief civil war with its secular rival, Fatah. Once the blockade was
   in place, Mr. Ramlawy's factory was unable to obtain raw materials from
   its Israeli suppliers.

   So, he improvised.

   “During the siege, recycling was the only way to survive,” says
   Ramlawy. With its supply chain severed, his firm began to collect
   plastic from the trash to melt down and turn into new products.
   “Otherwise we would have had to stop completely.”

   Thanks in part to Gazans like Ramlawy, Israel's blockade has been a
   double-edged sword for Gaza's environment. While the sanctions have
   exacerbated environmental problems ranging from sewage overflow to
   contaminated water, the scarcity of a wide range of goods has led both
   entrepreneurs and everyday people to turn to creative and
   entrepreneurial solutions.

   Once Ramlawy Plastics could no longer obtain Israeli raw materials, it
   replaced them with garbage, such as broken chairs and empty potato chip
   bags, bought from Gazans for $395 per ton. The company washed and mixed
   the materials with Egyptian plastic smuggled into Gaza through the
   Rafah tunnels along the Egypt-Gaza border, and made them into something
   new. The Egyptian plastic is poorer quality than what they formerly
   bought from Israel.

   It kept the company alive, but profits have shrunk to 7 percent and
   Ramlawy now employs just five men full-time. Production costs have
   tripled and demand has plummeted.

Shifting focus from irrigation pipes to garbage bags

   But in a place buffeted by so much hardship, Gazans have learned to
   make do any way they can.

   In Gaza City, demolition-cum-recycling crews scavenge what concrete
   they can from the rubble of war. Crews of young men and boys huddle at
   the edge of wrecked buildings with pick axes and shovels, carting
   chunks of cement off in donkey carts to be crushed into gravel that can
   be used to make repairs.

   Indeed, necessity is the mother of invention, a lesson that the
   blockade has taught men like Ramlawy and the cement pickers all too
   well.

   Once Ramlawy’s specialties were irrigation pipes and sturdy plastic
   bags to haul goods coming into Gaza from Israel. After cross-border
   traffic ceased and demand from farmers collapsed, the plant began
   producing bottles and bags for tissues. As the siege wore on, that
   strategy too faltered, as local production of tissues and bottled
   substances both stopped.
   Today the company focuses on “things people cannot live without,” says
   Ramlawy, like household garbage bags.
   He says demand for its irrigation products returned after the January
   2009 Gaza war, which left the territory’s irrigation network in ruins.
   That pushed an estimated 73 percent of those who live on farmland near
   the Israeli border into poverty, says the UN’s Office for the
   Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
   Ramlawy began buying tons of mangled plastic pipes from farmers for
   $1.30 a kilogram. He now sells three tons of post-recycled pipes each
   day. It is far less than the 20 tons of pipes he sold daily before the
   blockade began and, in his words, "business crashed."

Easing of Gaza siege not all good news

   In June, Israel – under intense international pressure following a
   fatal Israeli raid on a flotilla trying to break the blockade – eased
   restrictions on imports.

   The move was welcomed by the international community, but for those
   like Ramlawy who have learned to get by – and turn a profit – under
   siege, the eased import rules could be another source of instability.

   The possibility of the return of cheaper and higher quality Israeli
   goods and materials, such as the raw plastic his company once bought,
   makes Ramlawy nervous, and he has stopped buying plastic smuggled in
   from Egypt because he is worried he will be stuck with it if better and
   cheaper Israeli materials become available again.
   “If we change our business it might fail because Israel will enact new
   restrictions or circumstances, and if we stay in the same business it
   might fall apart for the same reasons,” he says. “In Gaza everything
   can change and there is nothing long-term.”

   This evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an official
   impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s actions, saying they
   undermine national security. Only two U.S. presidents have been
   impeached. We’re working on a story that looks at the role of moderate
