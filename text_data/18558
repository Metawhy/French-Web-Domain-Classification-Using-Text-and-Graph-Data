Six Ways To Log Tickets

   IMMEDIATE RESPONSE

   Provide an immediate response with Live chat between your end users and
   support staff. Availability and anonymity settings will only allow chat
   when you are ready and hide your (or their) identity if necessary. Chat
   transcripts can be converted directly into a ticket or added as a note.
   ONLINE 24/7

   End Users can log a new ticket online 24/7/365 from the built in
   Self-Service Interface on a computer or tablet. Your staff can even do
   it from the palm of their hand with our mobile interface.
   AUTO EMAIL TO TICKET

   Define your own email parsing rules that will read incoming emails to
   multiple accounts and take actions, including: log tickets, update
   tickets, reassign, close, send emails, create user accounts, and much
   more.


   MANUAL ENTRY

   Our quick entry process helps your staff log a new ticket in as few as
   three steps. So when the phone is ringing off the hook, they can move
   to the next issue quickly.
   RECURRING TICKETS

   Easily define tickets that need to be logged on a recurring schedule –
   like swapping out backup tapes or compiling a network health report –
   and Revelation will auto-log them to the appropriate person or queue.
   NO MORE COPY/PASTE

   If an end user or customer is sending support emails to your inbox, you
   can use our simple Outlook plug-in to convert them into tickets (or
   action notes) without having to copy and paste from the email into
   Revelation.

Revelation helpdesk will work with whatever structure you’ve got

   CENTRAL HUB

   Issues are directed to one person/group who assigns tickets where they
   belong. Powerful automated features assist by pre-selecting
   assignment/issue types/priorities/service levels/etc. based on your
   business rules.
   FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED

   Issues are dealt with in the order they arrive. Revelation assists by
   auto assigning tickets to the appropriate staff person so all you have
   to do is describe the issue and click 'LOG' before moving on to the
   next ticket.
   GROUP PARTITIONED

   Create seperate teams of help desk staff - each one assigned to a
   particular group of end users (or type of issue). You can even
   structure each team differently as needed.
   MULTI-TIERED

   Issues start at tier 1 and are escalated if necessary. Your staff can
   move tickets from tier to tier manually with ease or you can build in
   powerful escalation rules that will do the job for you.

Revelation is with you for the entire issue lifecycle



   It all starts when the ticket is logged – you need to capture the
   necessary info quickly and easily. If your software makes it difficult
   for you to log a ticket, then you’ve already lost the game. Make sure
   you start out with the fastest help desk issue capture process
   available.


   It’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. Revelation will help
   you be a superstar for your customers by taking care of the mundane,
   repetitive stuff so you can focus on providing the solution. It will
   even peer into the future to make sure there are no surprises waiting
   so you can always be ahead of the game.


   You’re two-thirds of the way there. You are capturing new issues like a
   pro and closing them so fast your customers think it’s magic. But
   that’s never enough, because they are never satisfied – you have to get
   better and Revelation helpdesk will help you


   Do it all from the palm of your hand – capture, resolve & learn – with
   no software to install because we are a 100% browser-based help desk
   solution.

About

   YellowFish Software was founded in 2001 out of pure frustration with
   the available help desk software solutions. Applications were too
   expensive and so inefficient that it often took longer to log a ticket
   than to fix the issue. We changed that with Revelation helpdesk and
   have never looked back.

Thoughts

   We think a lot about customer service and support and sometimes we
   write it down.
