What is Should I Remove It?

   Should I Remove It? is a very simple but extremely powerful Windows
   application that helps users, both technical and non technical, decide
   what programs they should remove from their PC. This typically includes
   finding and removing all sorts of crapware and bloatware such as
   adware, spyware, toolbars, bundled unwanted applications as well as
   many forms of malware. The program is very lightweight and extremely
   fast. Should I Remove It? simply scans your computer for all its'
   installed programs and then ranks what should be removed by leveraging
   the wisdom of the crowd (and of course our technical experts) to
   determine what should not be installed.

What is Should I Remove It?

   Should I Remove It? is a very simple but extremely powerful Windows
   application that helps users, both technical and non technical, decide
   what programs they should remove from their PC. This typically includes
   finding and removing all sorts of crapware and bloatware such as
   adware, spyware, toolbars, bundled unwanted applications as well as
   many forms of malware. The program is very lightweight and extremely
   fast. Should I Remove It? simply scans your computer for all its'
   installed programs and then ranks what should be removed by leveraging
   the wisdom of the crowd (and of course our technical experts) to

Who Are We?

   Should I Remove It? Is powered and created by Reason Software Company
   Inc, which is founded and run by former anti-virus/spyware experts from
   Microsoft. The impetus for Should I Remove It? was the recognition that
   many PC users from beginner to advance alike were unable to make
   confident decisions when it comes to removing software by merely
   looking at the app titles listed in Windows' Add/Remove Programs.
   Should I Remove It? was then ingeniously developed by our super savvy
   team specifically as a practical tool to help PC users make
   well-informed decisions when it comes to identifying and removing
   unessential programs such as adware toolbars, manufacturer bloatware
   and so forth.
