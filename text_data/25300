Privacy Policy & Opt-Out

Last updated: March 1st, 2019

   This Privacy Policy provides information about our data platform for
   digital advertising, explains who we are, how we collect, share and use
   information, and how you as a user can exercise your privacy rights.
   This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through
   our website at www.adsquare.com (“Website”), or otherwise process in
   the course of providing our products and services through our ‘Audience
   Management Platform’ (“AMP”).

   What does adsquare do?

   adsquare is not an ad network, data provider or media agency. adsquare
   is a digital advertising technology platform. It provides a transparent
   and neutral data exchange platform that brings together advertisers and
   data providers in a fair, secure and privacy-friendly way.

   The platform has been built mobile-first and facilitates the creation
   and execution of audience targeting for digital marketing campaigns.
   Our products and features make advertising more relevant for consumers
   and allow publishers to offer content for no or lower costs. The
   platform was built in Germany with user privacy at the core of its
   design from day one. Therefore, it complies with European Data
   Protection Regulations (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) and
   applicable national data protection laws.

   adsquare processes your information in order to ensure advertisers can
   provide you with relevant advertising based on your interests,
   affinities and local context and measure the effectiveness of their
   campaigns. The aim of this is to effectively reduce the amount of ads
   you see that aren’t beneficial or of interest to you. An opt-out from
   targeting would not reduce the amount of ads, it just makes the ads you
   receive less relevant.

   What information do we collect and for which purposes?

   The information that we collect about you when you visit our website or
   platform (A.) and information about you that we process through our AMP
   (B.) fall into the following categories:

   self-determination. Therefore, we require our clients and partners to

       about what advertisements were shown, how often they were shown,
       when and where they were shown, and whether you took any action
       related to the advertisement, including for example clicking an ad
       or making a purchase.

   ii. The creation of offline and online campaign measurement reports,
       analytics, and development of audience insights.

   (for more information on the “Types of Data” and purposes please refer
   to the explanation provided below under “Glossary of Basic Terms”)

   Data being submitted to adsquare from our clients and partners uses
   pseudonymous identifiers associated with your mobile device rather than
   names, email addresses or phone numbers. In addition to this, adsquare
   utilizes hashing, encryption and de-identification techniques to help
   ensure your privacy is safeguarded at all times when data is shared
   with third parties. adsquare enforces generally accepted industry
   security standards on the AMP to protect the information both during
   transmission and once it is received..

   Legal basis for processing (EEA visitors only)

   If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal
   basis for collecting and processing the information described above
   will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in
   which we collect and process it.
   We collect and process information from you only where we have your
   consent (Art. 6 para 1 lit. a) GDPR), where we need the information to
   provide our contractual obligation to you (Art. 6 para 1 lit. b) GDPR)
   or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.

   If you wish to learn more about specific legal ground(s) we rely on to
   process your information for any particular purpose (including any
   legitimate interests we have to process information), then please
   contact us using the details provided below under “Contact Us”.
   However, by way of example, we rely on our legitimate interests to
   process information for direct marketing purposes and for fraud
   prevention and detection, provided these interests are not overridden
   by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
   (Art. 6 para 1 lit. f) GDPR).

   Who do we share your information with?

   We disclose your information to the following categories of recipients:
     * To our affiliate and third party services providers who provide
       data processing services to us and support us in providing our
       services (for example, to support the delivery of, provide
       functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our website),
       or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are
       described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect

     * To our clients and partners including digital marketers, ad
       agencies, web publishers, demand side platforms, data management
       platforms or supply-side platforms which are listed in our Partner
       List, to deliver interest-based advertising, measurement or
       reporting services

     * To any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government
       agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is
       necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to
       exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect
       your vital interests or those of any other person,

     * To a potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in connection
       with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of

       Privacy Notice.

   International Data Transfer

   Our servers are located in the European Union (the Netherlands, France
   and Germany). However, your information may be transferred to and
   processed in countries other than the country in which you are
   resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are
   different from the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be
   as protective.

   In particular, some of our third parties we share your information with
   (see our third party list at www.adsquare.com/privacy/partner-list) may
   operate outside the EEA (e.g. United States of America). This means
   that when we transfer your information to these third parties, your
   information will be processed outside the EEA. If you are located in
   the EEA, we have taken appropriate safeguards to comply with EEA data
   transfer restrictions such as implementing a legal mechanism to
   lawfully transfer your personal information between the EEA and non-EEA
   countries, such as the United States. Where applicable, we implemented
   the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC”) for
   transfers of personal information with our affiliate as well as our
   clients and partners, to protect personal information they process from
   the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. You can
   obtain a copy of the SCC by contacting us using the contact details
   provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.

   How long do we keep your information?

   We retain personal information we collect from you as long as we have
   an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide
   you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
   legal, tax or accounting requirements).
   In any event, information that is transferred to us by our clients and
   partners will be deleted after a maximum period of three months or
   earlier if our clients and partners select to delete and update their
   data on the AMP more often.

   Your data protection rights

   You have the following data protection rights:
     * If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your
       personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us

       below.

     * In addition, if you are subject to European Data Protection
       Regulation, you can object to processing of your personal
       information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal
       information or request portability of your personal information.
       Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the
       contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.

     * You have the right to opt-out from our marketing communications at

       marketing or telemarketing), please contact us using the contact
       details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.

     * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal
       information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent
       at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the
       lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal,
       nor will it affect processing of your personal information
       conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
       consent.

       our collection and use of your personal information. For more

       Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries

   data protection laws.
