Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk !!

   October 20th, 2016 by ai14

   We have discovered spiral density waves in the distribution of dust
   particles around a very young low mass star.

   The results are published on Science.
   The manuscript is also available of astro-ph
   at http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161005139P

ASTR 400/500 – Fall 2019

   ASTR 400/500: ASTRONOMY SEMINAR SERIES, FALL 2019

   Instructor: Dr. Andrea Isella, HBH 354, x5491

   Location: Meets in HBH 227, Wednesdays from 12:05 pm to 12:55 pm

   Course Description: ASTR 400 (undergraduate) and ASTR 500 (graduate)
   are a 1-credit seminar class that meets every week at 12:05. The course
   may be repeated for credit. Junior and senior Astro-majors and all
   Astro-graduate students should sign up for this class each semester.

   Speakers include experts from around the world who come to Rice to
   discuss their research. Rice faculty, graduate students and
   undergraduates also participate by giving talks, the graduate
   students every semester and the undergrads every other semester.
   Student talks do not necessarily need to be on their own research.
   Full-hour talks should be 45 minutes in length, and half-hour talks 20
   minutes, with 5 minutes for questions. We must vacate the room before 1
   pm, so please be on time. It is up to the speakers to ensure that
   their talks display properly, so please check your presentation ahead
   of time. Abstracts should be provided to the instructor no later than
   Friday morning before the talk so notices can be distributed.

   Overall Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes: The goal of
   this course is to give students experience in giving and evaluating
   oral presentations on current astronomical research. By the end of the
   course, students will be able to evaluate whether a talk is clearly
   organized and accessible. Graduate students will gain experience in
   giving an oral presentation and over the course of the full year,
   undergraduate students will gain this same experience. Students will be
   exposed to a range of current astronomical research topics and gain an
   appreciation for the research being done in the department.

   Grading: Pass/fail. At least 80% attendance is required to pass, and
   students must present a talk as described above.

   Feedback: Students who work with a faculty member should get feedback
   on their talks from their advisers. The instructor will be available to
   provide feedback to all other students and answer any questions about
   the seminar immediately after the talks.

   Disability Information:
   Students with a documented disability that impacts their work in this
   class should contact me to discuss their needs. Disabled students
   should also register with the Disability Support Services Office in the
   Ley Student Center.
