   -Nest with egg by Rae Dunn
   -Flower doily by Tiny Little Stitches
   The inspiration board for Spring.
   This is the north wall of the studio.
   Our desks: where all the work/fun happens.

   ***The hand painted rocks will be available
   at my Etsy shop at 1:oo pm CST.
   I made a couple of surprise ones ;)

   Sorry about that!

On a Wednesday

   That's Daniel patiently waiting
   for his slice of cinnamon apple bread this morning.
   Whole wheat, organic yumminess.
   He is very thankful for all the
   nice comment you left about his stamps :)
   Still doing some spring cleaning in the studio.
   We hacked one of our old IKEA shelving units
   and replaced the shelves with with solid cedar planks
   and modified the length of the shelves a wee bit.

Stamps

   I recently purchased these two
   books online and they arrived last week.
   My eleven year old son Daniel
   was immediately smitten by them
   & got inspired to do some hand carving himself,
   and as his big brother told him:
   "You're a natural!".
   He turned out to be really good at it :)
   I love all the little details.
   And after the pirate ship,
   he decided to make a Star Wars starfighter.

Spring cleaning

   Spring cleaning
   and reorganizing in the studio again :)
   I put up some very pretty things on the wall,
   & I've got a nice spring like view from my desk.
   The boys and I share that desk, they check
   their school work there and it's where I do
   the packaging of all my shop orders.

Vegetable patch

   I was dreaming of having a veggie patch
   but since I'm really not good at gardening
   I painted myself a little plot.

Peek

   This is the beautiful hand bound
   leather Bible Manolo made for me.
   I mentioned it on the Etsy interview
   as my most cherished handmade possession
   & I wanted to share it with all of you.
   And a little peek into the drawers
   of my cabinet of curiosities ;)
   I finally have one special drawer
   for all of my hand carved stamps!

Nature collection

   These are 9 little 5 x 5 inches
   watercolor paintings I made last night
   as a little nature collection to hang
   from a wire in my boy's room.
   I scanned and rearranged all the elements
   & created a print that will be available
   in the shop later today.
   Camilla Engman
   created a very interesting Flickr group
   called Organized Collection,
   that I find it most inspiring!

   I'm trying to replicate
   these porcelain beauties by Coe & Waito
   as an exercise of observation.
   I'm making this one with white Polymer Clay.
   I'll show it to you once it's done...
   Happy month of March!

Shop update

   I've just updated my Etsy shop
   with 13 new prints!
   Some are second edition runs
   and some had never been printed before.
   There are now 73 different prints
   available to choose from :)
   Whew!
