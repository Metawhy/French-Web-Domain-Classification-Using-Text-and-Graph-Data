Leading Industry Since 2000

   NAI is a non-profit organization that is the leading self-regulatory
   association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for
   digital advertising. Since 2000, we have been working with the leaders
   in online advertising to craft policies that help ensure responsible
   data collection and use practices. The result is the development of
   high standards that are practical and scalable to benefit everyone.

   In 2013, the NAI extended its well-respected program and high standards
   to advertising across mobile applications by releasing a draft Code of
   Conduct for the mobile application environment.

   In 2015, the NAI published its Guidance for the use of non-cookie
   technologies, further extending its high standards to next-generation
   advertising technologies. We believe that implementing these best
   practices will enhance trust and support the continued development of
   informative, creative and free content and services on the Internet,
   across the mobile ecosystem, and beyond.

   In 2017, the NAI published the 2018 Code of Conduct, consolidating
   requirements for web-based and app-based data collection and use into
   one document, incorporating relevant NAI Guidance documents, and
   updating terminology.
