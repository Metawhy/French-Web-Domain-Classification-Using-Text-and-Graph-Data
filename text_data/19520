     * To develop friendly relations among nations
     * To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people,
       to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect
       for each other’s rights and freedoms
     * To be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve
       these goals

Process

   First, you will work in pairs using websites provided to learn about
   the United Nations and their four main purposes.  You and your partner
   will complete history questions and define vocabulary related to the
   UN.
   Second, you and your partner are part of a UN Task Force to achieve one
   of the eight UN Millennium Goals.  Your goal will be assigned to you by
   your teacher.  You and your partner will create a plan to successfully
   achieve the goal within a certain time frame with specific actions that
   will be implemented.  After the plan has been developed, you and your
   partner will present the plan to the General Assembly (your class).
   The General Assembly will vote on each plan and decide whether or not
   to pursue it.  If the General Assembly confirms they would like to
   implement your plan, your Task Force will earn points for that part of
   the webquest.
   Lastly, your Task Force will reflect on the purpose of the UN and
   whether it is an organization the United States should continue to be a
   part of.  You will write a letter to the Secretary-General of the UN
   expressing your opinions and use your new knowledge of the organization
   to support your opinions.
