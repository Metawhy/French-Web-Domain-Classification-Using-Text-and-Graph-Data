     Cameras for Raspberry Pi



     Motorized Focus Camera

                             Motorized Focus Camera

Introduction

     * The standard pi camera is fixed focus lens, some of them are glued
       which can not be adjust by users, and some of them are not glued
       which can be adjust the lens focus manually. But in certian
       circumstance, you want to programmably control the focus distance
       remotely where the device can not be reached. The ArduCAM team now
       designed motorized control focus 5MP and 8MP camera module for
       Raspberry Pi series boards to address this problem.
     *

Features

     * High-Definition video camera for Raspberry Pi Model A/B/B+ and
       Raspberry Pi 2 Pi 3B, Pi 3B+ and Pi Zero
     * 5MP OV5647 or 8MP IMX219 sensor with motorized focus lens
       Integral IR filter
     * Angle of View: 54 x 41 degrees

Wanna Use Synchronized Dual Camera for Raspberry Pi 4 or Stereo Camera HAT
for Pi 3B+/3? Arducam Makes Them All Come True

   Posted on September 16, 2019 by arducam19

Two camera Solution on pi 4, 3B+ and 3 – What you need to know about the
background

   Stereo Cameras on Raspberry Pi 4 3B+/3 - Synchronized Dual-Camera for
   Pi

   When we talk about a new two-camera solution on RPi, we have to mention
   the background of the stereo Pi camera on this popular open source
   hardware platform. For a long time, advanced users of the Raspberry Pi
   community want to take video or images from multiple cameras
   simultaneously for 3D vids & pics, face/object detection, stereo
   robotic vision or advanced surveillance and livestreaming applications,
   so they want a real stereo camera for raspberry pi 3, 4, and other
   standard Pi boards. It was an unresolved problem limited by the RPi’s
   hardware design because the standard Raspberry pi models only have one
   camera port. Although Arducam has multi-camera adapter boards that let
   you connect up to 4 cameras to a single pi board, it only actives one
   camera at a time, and you have to switch between them.

   The other alternative is to use network-based synchronization, but you
   still have to use one Raspberry pi board for each camera setup, and the
   capture process is still not at the exact same time which will
   introduce the movement or artifacts between multiple images.

New Stereoscopic Camera Breakout Board – Arducam’s Big Step Forward

   Dual camera adapter board on Raspberry Pi 4

   Now Arducam released a stereo camera HAT for Raspberry Pi which allows
   you to connect two 5MP OV5647 or two 8MP IMX219 Pi cameras to a single
   standard Pi board and takes images or video at the same time. More
   importantly, this binocular solution makes both camera fully
   synchronized. The highlight of this stereo camera HAT is that it
   incorporates Arducam proprietary ArduChip solution and extends the
   usage of the single pi camera port, and it cheats the Raspberry pi as
   if only one camera connected. It supports and is fully compatible with
   Raspistill commands for preview, and Raspivid command for video
   capture/processing with RPi’s default camera driver for its 5MP and 8MP
   cameras.

Panoramic (3D) photos and videos with Raspberry Pi 4

   3D Video Cameras for Raspberry Pi 4B/3b+/3

   With the latest Pi 4’s hardware, Arducam makes more camera applications
   possible for Raspberry Pi 4. This new HAT also supports other Arducam
   Raspberry Pi cameras and proprietary camera driver that works up to two
   16MP, and as the Pi 4 is much more powerful, you can not only shoot two
   pictures at the same time. With the shared oscillator and I2C
   broadcasting, the two cameras are fully synchronized in nanosecond
   level. These features are excellent for a lot of applications, such as
   3D Vision for IoT or panoramics photos and videos. Combined with a nice
   fisheye camera from Arducam and some image processing software, you can
   stitch a wonderful panorama with higher resolution and better accuracy.

     * Support camera side-by-side combine (split – right left), channel 0
       and channel 1 software switching on the fly
     * Support digital pan in half resolution combine, programmable pan
       speed control

       please use Arducam bundle kit
     * Typical Applications in Stereo Vision, 360 Camera and Advance
       Surveillance Camera
     * Contact us for other platform support

Real-time depth mapping – A Typical application in which this stereo solution
can be used

   So what is the point of two cameras? The short answer is you will get
   different information from each camera, and if it’s fully synchronized,
   it is real-time. The information difference then could be used in
   applications like distance and depth mapping. To put it simply, this is
   also a bionic solution because that’s like how eyes work. If you are a
   user of Google’s camera app, you might have used the “Len Blur” feature
   in it, which requires you to lift up the camera to take pictures, and
   that is also image information difference. In this feature, it
   calculates the distance to decide which object is in the front to stay
   clear and what else should be blurred in the background, so you can
   have a picture that seems like it’s from a DSLR lens. However, that is
   only a simple application used in our daily life, and you can have much
   more fancy projects like 3d modeling and AR/VR Cameras for Raspberry Pi
   4.

   We’ve already finished the prototype, and it will be available for bulk
   ordering soon!

     USB cameras



     Introduction

                                  Introduction

   Arducam now has two different solutions for USB camera, one is Arducam
   USB camera shield and the other is Arducam UVC camera.

   The Arducam USB camera shield is a general purpose camera control board
   designed for both PCs and embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi,
   Odriod, TI Beaglebone, and similar hardware. It supports almost all
   parallel interface image sensors ranging from 0.3MP to 16MP, including
   both global and rolling shutter sensors. The camera comes with
   a comprehensive software SDK library and example source code you need
   to make it working on Windows and Linux systems. The SDK is fully
   integrated with Python, which allows for direct integration of our
   cameras with your OpenCV based applications. This USB camera shield
   solution uses private camera driver and not UVC or V4L2 compatible, you
   have to use our proprietary SDK and API which gives you the flexibility
   to control all the sensor features from the register level. It is very
   useful for machine vision and scientific applications.
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *

   The Arducam UVC camera incorporates a dedicate image signal processor
   which support hardware ISP processing like AWB/AE/AF and JPEG or H.264
   encoding. It supports limited image sensors and limited resolution upto
   8MP. Not currently supported sensors should be customized to make it
   working. As it is UVC compliance, no special driver needed for Windows,
   Linux or Mac OS. It is useful for surveillance, IoT applications that
   use standard UVC or V4L2 camera software interface, and no need for
   unprocessed RAW image.

   All these two types of USB camera solutions can be customized, please
   contact us for detail information.
