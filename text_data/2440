Presentation

   PMOI is a research unit (EA 4490) belonging to the University of Lille
   (UDL) and the University du Littoral Côte d’Opale » (ULCO).

   In the PMOI clinician and non clinician researchers are working
   together (rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, bone radiologists,
   dental surgeons, cellular biologists, molecular biologists,
   physiologists, biochemist, spectroscopist). Their complementary
   competencies are focused to the study of the relationship between bone
   tissue and medullar adiposity. Their work hypothesis is that this
   relationship is involved in the pathogenesis of bone diseases such as
   osteoporosis and osteonecrosis.
