Pledge on Patreon

   Posted on August 16, 2014 by The Lapse Storytelling Podcast

   IFRAME: //player.vimeo.com/video/103571443

   Hear me out. Make a pledge on Patreon.
   The Lapse Storytelling Podcast has seen more praise than I can possibly
   account for in the short seven months I’ve run it. While oft mentioned
   alongside podcast heavyweights Radiolab, Snap Judgment, and even This
   American Life, The Lapse is indie to its core.

   Why? Because it’s run by one guy. This guy.

   Running a show like The Lapse is a full time gig. I spend hundreds of
   hours a month writing, curating, narrating, and editing the submissions
   we get. It is exhausting, penniless work. But it isn’t thankless. I
   have you to thank for that.

   There are exclusive rewards in it for you, everything from behind the
   scenes access to personalized lessons in storytelling.
   Donate now on Patreon and keep this sucker running for as little as $2
   a month. That ensures the show has an ongoing, definitive source of
   funding.
   Alternatively, you can also make one-time donation via the Paypal link
   on the right.

   Thanks, everybody.
