Press statement from the Gambia Bar Association

   0
   By Gainako on December 12, 2016 News

   The Gambia Bar Association condemns in the strongest possible terms
   the announcement by outgoing President Yahya Jammeh made on Friday the
   9th December 2016 wherein he declared the 1st December 2016 elections
   null
   and void.

   The said statement of the outgoing President contravenes the provisions
   of Section 49 of the 1997 Constitution of The Republic of The Gambia,
   and in our considered opinion is an abrogation of the Constitution and
   an attempt to
   subvert the legitimate decision of the People of The Gambia. Further,
   this action is tantamount to treason under the provisions of Section
   6(1) of the Constitution.

   We reject the subsequent statement by the APRC that it intends to file
   an election petition against the results published by the Independent
   Electoral Commission. The rhetoric of the APRC further compounds the
   illegitimate and
   destabilizing actions of the outgoing President.

   While under normal circumstances the right to petition against election
   results does exist,the situation in The Gambia now, is that there is no
   constituted panel of the Supreme Court. The GBA notes with concern that
   since May
   2015, there has not been a sitting Supreme Court session due to the
   absence of a panel. This is despite several reminders issued to the
   Chief Justice by members of the Bar. In the circumstance; it would be
   against the principles of
   natural justice for the outgoing President to appoint Supreme Court
   Judges to hear a Petition filed by him or on his behalf. That would be
   tantamount to one being a Judge in his own cause considering that the
   outgoing President has
   already pre-empted the outcome of Court process by declaring the
   election result as a nullity. It is the position of the GBA that an
   outgoing President must not be appointing Judges who should have been
   appointed since 2015 .
   In the present circumstances, any Supreme Court expanded by
   the outgoing President Jammeh for the purposes of hearing his election
   petition would be fundamentally tainted.

   The Gambia Bar Association therefore states that there is no legitimate
   legal mechanism available in The Gambia to hear and determine the
   election petition filed by the outgoing President Jammeh or on his
   behalf. Under the circumstances we call on outgoing President Jammeh to
   respect the outcome of the December 2016 elections and immediately hand
   over power peacefully to President Elect Adama Barrow in line with the
   sovereign will of the people of The Gambia. Any other course of action
   will jeopardize the peace and stability of our country.

   We also call on other professional bodies, unions, civil society
   organisations, the civil and public service and the security forces to
   respect the will of the people and pledge their allegiance to the
   President Elect. We also call on the African Commission on Human and
   Peoples’ Rights headquartered here in The Gambia to strongly urge the
   outgoing President to respect the outcome of the just concluded
   Presidential elections and to further respect the relevant regional and
   international human rights instruments binding on The Gambia.

   We ask all members of the Bar Association and the staff of the
   judiciary in particular to boycott the courts in solidarity with the
   people until such time as the Government of outgoing President Jammeh
   accepts the result of these
   elections and hand over Power to the President Elect.

Editorial: Yahya Jammeh’s Rejection of Election Results; Suicide Mission or a
Bargaining Tool for Amnesty?

   3
   By Gainako on December 12, 2016 Editorial

   Barely one week after the Gambian Dictator for 22 years graciously
   conceded defeat at the December 1^st 2016 Presidential elections
   concluded peacefully; Jammeh has reversed course by declaring to the
   world on National Television that he is rejecting the results that
   clearly shows he was beaten by Adama Barrow and the opposition
   coalition. Mr. Jammeh’s announcement was made on Gambia Radio and
   Television Services Friday evening December 9^th, when he read the
   final results of the IEC which still shows he lost to the President –
   Elect Adama Barrow.

   President Jammeh’s reason for rejecting the results is premise on his
   alleged rigging of the elections at the polls by the marginalized
   opposition. He said “some of the electorates were told at the polling
   stations that the opposition has won the elections thereby discouraging
   those voters from casting their ballots. Jammeh also claimed that out
   of over 886,000 registered voters little over 500,000 came out and
   voted. As a result, Jammeh wonders why the rest of the registered
   voters did not come out to vote!  Jammeh said the IEC Chairman Alhagie
   Mamar Njai and his election team were “independent” yet he is rejecting
   the results they declared.

   It is unprecedented and frankly an insult to historic precedence that a
   Dictator who has ruled his country with impunity for 22 years;
   controlling every institution of governance including the security
   apparatus would cry foul and claim elections have been rigged. Mr.
   Jammeh throughout his tenure has governed in the most brutal ways
   locking his opponents; dismissing, arresting, kidnapping and executing
   in cold blood some of his political opponents. There are thousands of
   Gambians who are locked up, some killed and countless others exiled for
   simply challenging dictator Jammeh’s oppressive rule.  For such a
   leader known throughout the world as an autocrat and control freak d
   who doesn’t allow an open process to complain about election rigging is
   best laughable and at worst embarrassing.

   Mr. Jammeh’s latest political amateurish behavior is not the least
   surprising to many Gambians and other political pundits. In fact, the
   only thing surprising to the Gambian people was Jammeh’s gracious
   acceptance of the elections barely hours after he was declared the
   loser at the polls. Many people wonder if they were dreaming to hear
   Yahya Jammeh call President – Elect Adama Barrow and congratulated him.
   Some had to pinch themselves several times to see if they really still
   had pulse and feelings in their body. The narrative of Jammeh’s 22
   years of brutal rule just coming to an abrupt end like that without him
   contemplating what would happen to him next was just too good to be
   true. Everything was unfolding too quickly in his face for him to be
   able to absorb the reality of the day.

   Gambians must have known that the Yahya Jammeh we have been fighting
   against for all these years was not capable of being so gracious and so
   humanely. He couldn’t have been born again over night and all of a
   sudden became a role model of democracy, peace and patriotism without
   pounding his chest with threats of burying citizens six feet deep. Was
   this Yahya Jammeh on steroid? many Gambians across the world were
   shocked that he conceded the elections so quickly. Mr. Jammeh is not
   capable of being decent and certainly 22 years of killings, torture and
   maiming of citizens couldn’t have been wipe-out of his memory and
   blood. He has committed too many crimes and created too many enemies to
   just go like that. Therefore, after his strong depression medication
   wore out, Jammeh found himself in a different universe. His wife has
   fled the country, his so-called power and two decades of privileges are
   just about gone out the window! Oh my God, Jammeh realized all of a
   sudden he was dealing with reality, one he was never expecting in his
   life time – ‘life without the presidency.’ He then began to scramble to
   rally the security chiefs and put his morally weak securities on
   standby… Jammeh would not let go of power and hand over the country
   peacefully without a fight. He neither believe in Democracy nor the
   will of the people. Jammeh is a true dictator and not a smart one for
   that matter. He immediately pivoted and began to search for an excuse
   to not get out of power. Amazingly, Jammeh is now contemplating suing
   the IEC – the very body he illegally created and filled it with puppets
   he can hire and fire any time he wants. And worst Jammeh expects the
   courts to rule against him, the very courts he has tampered with in
   every opportunity by arresting and jailing his chief justices, attorney
   General and other judges. Jammeh must be kidding himself to expect
   Gambians to buy into his scheme to buy more time..

   History is full of lessons and without our ability to learn from
   history and relate to other circumstances one could never understand
   what is happening to them. The Gambian people and the world have woken
   up to a new day of freedom in Gambia while Jammeh was fast asleep. The
   celebrations and congratulatory messages were non-stop. Jammeh could
   not and would not live with this reality. Unfortunately, for Mr. Jammeh
   his time is up and he is better of focusing on plan B – how to
   negotiate his life and potentially live free somewhere away from
   Gambia. In our humble opinion, Yahya Jammeh’s latest move to reject the
   election results after willingly conceding defeat is a ploy to
   negotiate a safe exit for him and some of his most ill-educated
   security personnel.

   This is the most reasonable explanation we can see Jammeh is pulling.
   Certainly, Jammeh knows the fate of his friend former Ivorian President
   Lawrence Gbagbo after he too rejected elections that booted him out.
   Jammeh also knows that the world has no more tolerance for people like
   him thus his reason for pulling Gambia out of treaties, the ICC and
   staying away from regional functions. We therefore believe that Yahya
   Jammeh is looking for a way out peacefully. He must be by now reaching
   out to his rare friends to find him a place to escape with unlimited
   resources he has looted from Gambia. The Gambian people must prepare to
   take on Jammeh should he wants to remain in power past January. It is
   our humble believe that Jammeh is already in advance negotiations to
   let go of power something he never dreams of doing. Anything less
   Jammeh must be on a suicide mission and Gambians just need to ensure
   that not a single blood of Gambians is spilled to protect his
   aspiration to remain in power for the rest of his life. As they say man
   proposes God disposes and Jammeh’s rejection of the results is just
   that a proposal and God has already disposed his fate.

       Outgoing president Jammeh’s belated rejection of the December 1st
       election results and call for a fresh one is not only unfortunate
       but also misguided. It should better dawn on him that his iron fist
       style of leadership was explicitly quashed by the electorate in the
       ballot box . He no longer retains the mandate to overstep the other
       arms of govt as he has previously been doing. Whereas the writer
       airs his personal views on Jammeh’s insincere intention, I am of a
       variant opinion. As his fellow African dictators have recently been
       doing, Jammeh may be on a power-sharing mission. Feeling insecure
       over the fast unfolding events, he may deliberately create an
       untenable crisis forcing ECOWAS or other organizations to
       interceed. Majority of these dictators refuse to relinquish power
       after losing and cause post-election violence ending up in a 50-50
       power-sharing basis. A (cermonial) Prime Minister’s post is
       hurriedly created if it was there and offered to the genuine
       winner. The loser retains the presidency and slowly grabs back
       power while he demolarises and shortchanges the PM’s power as he
       eventually rigs himself back in the following election retaining
       dictatorship indefinitely. Personally, the election is now water
       under the bridge and Jammeh should better allow a peaceful
       transition or follow his former Ivorian counterpart’s path sooner
       rather than later. May peace be with Gambians. God bless you!

            ..yes, yaya tried to muddy the water that tends to flow
            against his pedals. Had he been that intelligent, he should
            have que-ed for long that the longest day has a night, n with
            sincerity for distributive justice he will definately be held
            to account one day if he doesn’t die in power…from each to
            each n to each from each…YAYA’S rejection of the results stood
            on the platform of a safe exit….too late..! His display of
            arrogance, dictatorial tyrannical peg, has been flourished by
            his sincere ignorance n contagious stupidity. Gambia n
            Gambians have bn “walled”, by his unrepentance to a revolt by
            the ballot…no one group remain suppressed n oppressed for ever
            without a successful revolt n so is the Gambian situation.
            Yaya needs to leave now. Now 2morrow or later but now…

       I meant a ceremonial Prime Minister’s post is hurriedly created if
       the country did not have one. Sorry for the mix up.

U.S. calls Gambia crisis ‘very dangerous’ ahead of presidents’ visit

   0
   By Gainako on December 12, 2016 News
   The United States said on Monday Gambia had reached “a very dangerous
   moment” as West African leaders prepared to travel there to tell
   long-ruling leader Yahya Jammeh to accept his election defeat and step
   down.

   Jammeh had quickly conceded defeat to Adama Barrow, his challenger in
   the Dec. 1 presidential election. But in a volte-face that drew
   international condemnation he rejected the poll results on Friday.

   His ruling party said he would challenge the election outcome at the
   Supreme Court, raising the prospect that Barrow’s victory, which was
   poised to end 22 years of Jammeh’s authoritarian rule, could be
   overturned.

   “It is a very dangerous moment,” Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the
   United Nations, told reporters following a closed-door briefing of the
   15-member Security Council on the situation in the tiny riverside
   nation.

   She said some military officers had sided with Jammeh following his
   shock reversal. But she added that the Council was unified in its
   condemnation of the former coup leader’s actions.

   “Everybody is singing from the same sheet of music and the song is
   clear: you have lost the election, President Jammeh, and you must give
   up power peacefully,” Power said.

   Liberia’s President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel peace laureate and
   current chair of the West African regional body ECOWAS, is due to
   travel to Gambia on Tuesday.

   She will head a delegation of West African heads of state including
   Nigeria’s Muhammadu Buhari, John Mahama of Ghana and Sierra Leone’s
   Ernest Bai Koroma.

   “These heads of state will ask him to leave power,” the foreign
   ministry of Gambia’s neighbour, Senegal, which has taken a particularly
   aggressive stance towards Jammeh, said in a statement. It called the
   trip “a last chance mission” for Gambia’s president.

   The United States, European Union, African Union, United Nations and
   ECOWAS have all pressed Jammeh to respect the election result. Gambia’s
   Communications Minister Sheriff Bojang was not reachable for comment on
   Monday.

   “WE WANT PEACE”

   Barrow told Reuters in the capital Banjul that he expected Johnson
   Sirleaf’s delegation to ensure an “expedited transitional period” that
   would pave the way for a transfer of power.

   “We are not talking about a military option. We want to safeguard our
   democracy and we want peace,” he said, but added that he was concerned
   for his own safety. “I have no official security. As president-elect, I
   should not be exposed in the way I am today,” he said.

   Barrow said he had not had any communication with Jammeh’s government
   since the president’s televised announcement on Friday. Unarmed
   supporters surround his residence in the capital Banjul as protection
   and move with him when he leaves his home. Jammeh seized power in a
   coup in 1994 when he was an army lieutenant and went on to win four
   elections that were criticised by rights monitors. International human
   rights groups accuse him of widespread violations and repression.

   He declared Gambia an Islamic Republic last year and in October
   announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court.

   Rights groups say Jammeh exerts strong influence over the Supreme
   Court, which has not held session in a year and a half. There is
   currently only a sitting chief justice. And so in order to hear
   Jammeh’s complaint, legal experts believe at least four more judges
   must be appointed.

   Gambia’s bar association on Monday rejected the prospect of a Supreme
   Court staffed with new appointees to hear Jammeh’s challenge and called
   on its members to boycott the country’s courts until he hands over
   power to president-elect Barrow.

   “In the present circumstances, any Supreme Court empanelled by the
   outgoing President Jammeh for the purpose of hearing his election
   petition would be fundamentally tainted,” it said.
