   EliteSingles › About us

About us

   ELITESINGLES is brought to you by Spark Networks Services GmbH, one of
   Europe’s leading online matchmaking providers. Founded in 2008 in
   Berlin, (former Affinitas) launched its first online dating
   portal eDarling in Germany in May 2009. Today, the company has earned
   the trust of more than 13 million singles, creating on average 2000
   couples every month in over 20 countries worldwide.

   ELITESINGLES is a partnership service designed for South African
   singles looking for a long-term commitment. Our smart profiling
   delivers compatible partner suggestions in line with your personal
   search preferences, and we manually verify all new profiles to ensure
   users have a smooth, safe environment in which to meet other
   like-minded singles.

   Our vision is to maintain the industry's highest standards – to be the
   dating site as committed as our members are to finding love.  Numerous
   certifications and awards testify how successful we already are in this
   area. Nevertheless, the most important indicator of the value of our
   work is, and will always remain, the couples that meet each other
   through our platforms on a daily basis.

Our Matching Process

   The ELITESINGLES matching process introduces members on the basis of an
   initial personality questionnaire and your individual search
   preferences. We curate the site by manually verifying all profiles,
   automatically removing inactive members, and proactively removing users
   we suspect are not serious. This means our members have a smooth
   browsing experience and can focus on dating.

   The ELITESINGLES personality profile is based on the “Big Five” model
   of personality psychology. Initially developed in the 1990s, it is one
   of the most important and renowned concepts in modern psychology. Using
   the results of five personality dimensions, we are able to identify
   couples who are particularly well suited to a long and happy
   relationship together. Then, if the couple's demographic data and
   personal preferences are also a match, the two members are suggested to
   each other.

   The demographic data we consider includes gender, age, residence,
   profession and level of education. Additionally, in order to match
   personal preferences we explore various aspects that could be
   significant for long-term relationship prospects. For instance, we ask
   "How important is your future partner's religion?" and "Do you want
   children? “

   Protecting your personal information is of our utmost priority. We
   utilise Manual Profile Verification, SSL Encryption and a Fraud
   Detection System to make sure members feel safe online. All sensitive
   data is encrypted and will not be revealed to any third party or other
   members.

   ELITESINGLES is also available in the United
   Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, The United States and Canada.

     I had seen commercials for EliteSingles, and was originally

     much they took into consideration what I was looking for in my

Local dating in South Africa: search for love in the right place

   Whether ‘home’ is Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth or elsewhere,
   EliteSingles offers you a local dating service which helps you easily
   meet compatible singles in your city. We support people all across
   South Africa to find their dream partner and the loving, long-term
   relationship they’ve been searching for.

   For singles across South Africa cities, meeting that one person who
   really fits can be a serious challenge. Using EliteSingles, however,
   you don’t need to compromise on what you’re looking for, or the
   distance you’re willing to travel to find it. We have members across
   South Africa who share a commitment to finding real love that lasts.
   From the bustle of Johannesburg to the pristine beaches of Durban,
   finding a date who understands you in South Africa might sometimes feel
   like a tall order. If you’re looking for somewhere to meet singles with
   real chemistry, what matters most is simply knowing where to look.

   Those who use our dating site aren’t interested in casual dating; they
   want to find the real deal. To give you an idea of who’s registered
   with us, EliteSingles users are professional, educated singles, aged
   30-55 and genuine about finding love that lasts. If this sounds like
   you, then join us today and take your first step towards long-term
   relationship happiness.

Compatibility matters

   At EliteSingles we prioritise compatibility as the key for
   relationships that last the distance. For us, compatibility doesn’t
   simply mean that you share hobbies and interests with your partner.
   While this is always important, a shared interest in art or cinema
   isn’t always enough to get a relationship through the good times and
   the bad. Our smart matching algorithm instead understands compatibility
   on a deeper level – we believe that a couple needs true harmony in
   their personalities to be successful in the long term.

   We also recognise that most of our members have busy, professional
   lives, and have become frustrated at the lack of potential
   partners they meet offline. That’s why our Smart Profiling system is
   engineered so that users easily meet like-minded singles close by.
   Naturally we also make sure that members are also able to define their
   ideal type; you might be a single parent looking to find a partner with
   children, or a Christian looking for someone who shares your faith. By
   defining your individual search criteria we can introduce you to
   singles with better long-term potential, which means you don’t waste
   time browsing unsuitable profiles.

   Finding love in South Africa needn’t be so difficult. If you're looking
   for a better long-term relationship with someone truly on your
   wavelength, then we’re the dating agency for you. We’re dedicated to
   supporting all our members in their search for love– register today and
   see who you can meet.
