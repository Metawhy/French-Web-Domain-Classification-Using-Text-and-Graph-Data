Abstract

   This work estimates the energy embedded in wasted food annually in the
   United States. We calculated the energy intensity of food production
   from agriculture, transportation, processing, food sales, storage, and
   preparation for 2007 as 8080 ± 760 trillion BTU. In 1995 approximately
   27% of edible food was wasted. Synthesizing these food loss figures
   with our estimate of energy consumption for different food categories
   and food production steps, while normalizing for different production
   volumes, shows that 2030 ± 160 trillion BTU of energy were embedded in
   wasted food in 2007. The energy embedded in wasted food represents
   approximately 2% of annual energy consumption in the United States,
   which is substantial when compared to other energy conservation and
   production proposals. To improve this analysis, nationwide estimates of
   food waste and an updated estimate for the energy required to produce
   food for U.S. consumption would be valuable.

Abstract

   The protective effect of proanthocyanidins from persimmon peel, using
   both oligomers and polymers, was investigated in a db/db type 2
   diabetes model. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups: control
   (vehicle), polymer-, or oligomer- (10 mg/(kg body weight·day·p.o.))
   administered mice. Age-matched nondiabetic m/m mice were used as a
   normal group. The administration of proanthocyanidins reduced
   hyperglycemia in db/db mice through a decline in the serum level of
   glucose and glycosylated protein. In addition, it had a strong effect
   on hyperlipidemia through lowering levels of triglyceride, total
   cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. The protective effect
   against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia was greater in the groups
   administered the oligomeric rather than polymeric form. The increased
   oxidative stress in db/db mice was attenuated by the administration of
   oligomers through inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species
   and lipid peroxidation and elevating the reduced glutathione/oxidized
   glutathione ratio. On the other hand, polymers did not show such an
   effect. Moreover, expressions in the liver of sterol regulatory element
   binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2 were downregulated by the
   administration of proanthocyanidins, especially the oligomeric form.
   Oligomers caused a slight elevation in the expression of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors α. Furthermore, oligomeric
   proanthocyanidin regulated the expression of nuclear factor κB in db/db
   type 2 diabetes via the activation of inhibitor protein κB-α. It also
   attenuated the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase. This suggests that oligomers would act as a
   regulator in inflammatory reactions associated with oxidative stress in
   type 2 diabetes. The present study results suggest that
   proanthocyanidin administration, especially the oligomeric form, may
   improve oxidative stress via the regulation of hyperlipidemia than
   hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Demand for high-volume, short duration water withdrawals could create
   water stress to aquatic organisms in Fayetteville Shale streams sourced
   for hydraulic fracturing fluids. We estimated potential water stress
   using permitted water withdrawal volumes and actual water withdrawals
   compared to monthly median, low, and high streamflows. Risk for
   biological stress was considered at 20% of long-term median and 10% of
   high- and low-flow thresholds. Future well build-out projections
   estimated potential for continued stress. Most water was permitted from
   small, free-flowing streams and “frack” ponds (dammed streams).
   Permitted 12-h pumping volumes exceeded median streamflow at 50% of
   withdrawal sites in June, when flows were low. Daily water usage, from
   operator disclosures, compared to median streamflow showed possible
   water stress in 7–51% of catchments from June–November, respectively.
   If 100% of produced water was recycled, per-well water use declined by
   25%, reducing threshold exceedance by 10%. Future water stress was
   predicted to occur in fewer catchments important for drinking water and
   species of conservation concern due to the decline in new well
   installations and increased use of recycled water. Accessible and
   precise withdrawal and streamflow data are critical moving forward to
   assess and mitigate water stress in streams that experience high-volume
   withdrawals.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Pollution of the environment with plastic debris is a significant and
   rapidly expanding threat to biodiversity due to its abundance,
   durability, and persistence. Current knowledge of the negative effects
   of debris on wildlife is largely based on consequences that are readily
   observed, such as entanglement or starvation. Many interactions with
   debris, however, result in less visible and poorly documented sublethal
   effects, and as a consequence, the true impact of plastic is
   underestimated. We investigated the sublethal effects of ingested
   plastic in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) using blood
   chemistry parameters as a measure of bird health. The presence of
   plastic had a significant negative effect on bird morphometrics and
   blood calcium levels and a positive relationship with the concentration
   of uric acid, cholesterol, and amylase. That we found blood chemistry
   parameters being related to plastic pollution is one of the few
   examples to date of the sublethal effects of marine debris and
   highlights that superficially healthy individuals may still experience
   the negative consequences of ingesting plastic debris. Moving beyond
   crude measures, such as reduced body mass, to physiological parameters
   will provide much needed insight into the nuanced and less visible
   effects of plastic.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   A substantial fraction of marine plastic debris originates from
   land-based sources and rivers potentially act as a major transport
   pathway for all sizes of plastic debris. We analyzed a global
   compilation of data on plastic debris in the water column across a wide
   range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic
   (particles <5 mm) and macroplastic (particles >5 mm) are positively
   related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river
   catchments. This relationship is nonlinear where large rivers with
   population-rich catchments delivering a disproportionately higher
   fraction of MMPW into the sea. The 10 top-ranked rivers transport
   88–95% of the global load into the sea. Using MMPW as a predictor we
   calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to
   range between 0.41 and 4 × 10^6 t/y. Due to the limited amount of data
   high uncertainties were expected and ultimately confirmed. The
   empirical analysis to quantify plastic loads in rivers can be extended
   easily by additional potential predictors other than MMPW, for example,
   hydrological conditions.

Abstract

   This work estimates the energy embedded in wasted food annually in the
   United States. We calculated the energy intensity of food production
   from agriculture, transportation, processing, food sales, storage, and
   preparation for 2007 as 8080 ± 760 trillion BTU. In 1995 approximately
   27% of edible food was wasted. Synthesizing these food loss figures
   with our estimate of energy consumption for different food categories
   and food production steps, while normalizing for different production
   volumes, shows that 2030 ± 160 trillion BTU of energy were embedded in
   wasted food in 2007. The energy embedded in wasted food represents
   approximately 2% of annual energy consumption in the United States,
   which is substantial when compared to other energy conservation and
   production proposals. To improve this analysis, nationwide estimates of
   food waste and an updated estimate for the energy required to produce
   food for U.S. consumption would be valuable.

Abstract

   The protective effect of proanthocyanidins from persimmon peel, using
   both oligomers and polymers, was investigated in a db/db type 2
   diabetes model. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups: control
   (vehicle), polymer-, or oligomer- (10 mg/(kg body weight·day·p.o.))
   administered mice. Age-matched nondiabetic m/m mice were used as a
   normal group. The administration of proanthocyanidins reduced
   hyperglycemia in db/db mice through a decline in the serum level of
   glucose and glycosylated protein. In addition, it had a strong effect
   on hyperlipidemia through lowering levels of triglyceride, total
   cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. The protective effect
   against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia was greater in the groups
   administered the oligomeric rather than polymeric form. The increased
   oxidative stress in db/db mice was attenuated by the administration of
   oligomers through inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species
   and lipid peroxidation and elevating the reduced glutathione/oxidized
   glutathione ratio. On the other hand, polymers did not show such an
   effect. Moreover, expressions in the liver of sterol regulatory element
   binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2 were downregulated by the
   administration of proanthocyanidins, especially the oligomeric form.
   Oligomers caused a slight elevation in the expression of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors α. Furthermore, oligomeric
   proanthocyanidin regulated the expression of nuclear factor κB in db/db
   type 2 diabetes via the activation of inhibitor protein κB-α. It also
   attenuated the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase. This suggests that oligomers would act as a
   regulator in inflammatory reactions associated with oxidative stress in
   type 2 diabetes. The present study results suggest that
   proanthocyanidin administration, especially the oligomeric form, may
   improve oxidative stress via the regulation of hyperlipidemia than
   hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Demand for high-volume, short duration water withdrawals could create
   water stress to aquatic organisms in Fayetteville Shale streams sourced
   for hydraulic fracturing fluids. We estimated potential water stress
   using permitted water withdrawal volumes and actual water withdrawals
   compared to monthly median, low, and high streamflows. Risk for
   biological stress was considered at 20% of long-term median and 10% of
   high- and low-flow thresholds. Future well build-out projections
   estimated potential for continued stress. Most water was permitted from
   small, free-flowing streams and “frack” ponds (dammed streams).
   Permitted 12-h pumping volumes exceeded median streamflow at 50% of
   withdrawal sites in June, when flows were low. Daily water usage, from
   operator disclosures, compared to median streamflow showed possible
   water stress in 7–51% of catchments from June–November, respectively.
   If 100% of produced water was recycled, per-well water use declined by
   25%, reducing threshold exceedance by 10%. Future water stress was
   predicted to occur in fewer catchments important for drinking water and
   species of conservation concern due to the decline in new well
   installations and increased use of recycled water. Accessible and
   precise withdrawal and streamflow data are critical moving forward to
   assess and mitigate water stress in streams that experience high-volume
   withdrawals.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Pollution of the environment with plastic debris is a significant and
   rapidly expanding threat to biodiversity due to its abundance,
   durability, and persistence. Current knowledge of the negative effects
   of debris on wildlife is largely based on consequences that are readily
   observed, such as entanglement or starvation. Many interactions with
   debris, however, result in less visible and poorly documented sublethal
   effects, and as a consequence, the true impact of plastic is
   underestimated. We investigated the sublethal effects of ingested
   plastic in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) using blood
   chemistry parameters as a measure of bird health. The presence of
   plastic had a significant negative effect on bird morphometrics and
   blood calcium levels and a positive relationship with the concentration
   of uric acid, cholesterol, and amylase. That we found blood chemistry
   parameters being related to plastic pollution is one of the few
   examples to date of the sublethal effects of marine debris and
   highlights that superficially healthy individuals may still experience
   the negative consequences of ingesting plastic debris. Moving beyond
   crude measures, such as reduced body mass, to physiological parameters
   will provide much needed insight into the nuanced and less visible
   effects of plastic.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   A substantial fraction of marine plastic debris originates from
   land-based sources and rivers potentially act as a major transport
   pathway for all sizes of plastic debris. We analyzed a global
   compilation of data on plastic debris in the water column across a wide
   range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic
   (particles <5 mm) and macroplastic (particles >5 mm) are positively
   related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river
   catchments. This relationship is nonlinear where large rivers with
   population-rich catchments delivering a disproportionately higher
   fraction of MMPW into the sea. The 10 top-ranked rivers transport
   88–95% of the global load into the sea. Using MMPW as a predictor we
   calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to
   range between 0.41 and 4 × 10^6 t/y. Due to the limited amount of data
   high uncertainties were expected and ultimately confirmed. The
   empirical analysis to quantify plastic loads in rivers can be extended
   easily by additional potential predictors other than MMPW, for example,
   hydrological conditions.

Abstract

   Previous studies of uptake and effects of nanoplastics by marine
   organisms have been conducted at what may be unrealistically high
   concentrations. This is a consequence of the analytical challenges in
   tracking plastic particles in organisms at environmentally relevant
   concentrations and highlights the need for new approaches. Here, we
   present pulse exposures of ^14C-radiolabeled nanopolystyrene to a
   commercially important mollusk, Pecten maximus, at what have been
   predicted to be environmentally relevant concentrations (<15 μg L^–1).
   Uptake was rapid and was greater for 24 nm than for 250 nm particles.
   After 6 h, autoradiography showed accumulation of 250 nm nanoplastics
   in the intestine, while 24 nm particles were dispersed throughout the
   whole-body, possibly indicating some translocation across epithelial
   membranes. However, depuration was also relatively rapid for both
   sizes; 24 nm particles were no longer detectable after 14 days,
   although some 250 nm particles were still detectable after 48 days.
   Particle size thus apparently influenced the biokinetics and suggests a
   need for chronic exposure studies. Modeling extrapolations indicated
   that it could take 300 days of continued environmental exposure for
   uptake to reach equilibrium in scallop body tissues although the
   concentrations would still below 2.7 mg g^–1. Comparison with previous
   work in which scallops were exposed to nonplastic (silver)
   nanomaterials of similar size (20 nm), suggests that nanoparticle
   composition may also influence the uptake tissue distributions
   somewhat.

   Plastics are lightweight, inexpensive, and highly durable materials
   that are used in a wide variety of products, which have contributed to
   almost every aspect of modern life, displacing other materials and
   revolutionizing contemporary society. In 2016, global plastics
   production totaled around 335 million metric tons, around 40% of which
   was in single-use products that are discarded rapidly.(1) Consequently,
   considerable quantities of end-of-life plastics have accumulated as
   waste in managed systems and as litter in the environment. Once in the
   environment, exposure to ultraviolet light can cause plastics to become
   brittle and then fragment by mechanical action, leading to the
   formation of microscopic pieces, sometimes known as microplastics
   (MP).(2) It is estimated that up to 51 trillion microplastic fragments
   have accumulated at the sea surface and that quantities are
   increasing.(3) It has been widely suggested that this fragmentation
   will eventually result in the formation of plastic nanoparticles (NP).
   Current analytical approaches limit the ability to isolate and identify
   nanoparticles from environmental media. However, there is some
   experimental evidence to indicate the potential for nanoparticles to
   have accumulated in the environment. For example, Koelmans et al.(4)
   (2015) reported fragmentation of expanded polystyrene (EPS) to micro-
   and nanosize pieces in experiments involving a month of accelerated
   mechanical abrasion with glass beads and sand. Some other laboratory
   studies have also identified the presence of plastics at the nanoscale
   in water, after exposure of larger plastics pieces to UV and visible
   radiation.(5,6) Given the current rate of entry of plastic litter to
   the environment the potential for substantial long-term accumulation of
   nanoplastic fragments seems high. In addition, a range of nanoplastic
   particles are manufactured for commercial applications, including in
   paints, adhesives, coatings, biomedical products, electronics,(7) and
   cosmetics;(8) it seems likely that some of these manufactured
   nanoparticles will also be released to the environment.
   A number of studies, all of which are laboratory based, have
   investigated either the uptake or effects of nanoplastics on a range of
   marine organisms. The majority have used concentrations exceeding by
   two to seven orders-of-magnitude, those predicted to occur in the
   environment (e.g., ref (3), SI Figure S1 and associated references).
   Predicted environmental concentrations, which are likely to increase
   exponentially as the particle size decreases are, for example, 1 pg
   L^–1 to 15 μg L^–1 (μg L^–1 = parts per billion, ppb) for ∼50 nm and
   below 0.5 μg L^–1 for 5 μm plastic particles.(9) Concentrations are
   likely to be higher in environmental compartments where there is some
   degree of plastic particle accumulation.
   A first step toward understanding the potential effects of nanoplastics
   on organisms is to describe the dynamics of ingestion and accumulation
   at predicted environmental concentrations in seawater (i.e., up to 15
   ppb).(10) This has proven to be a difficult analytical challenge. Some
   studies have attempted to track fluorescent particles using
   commercially available, manufactured, surface-functionalized
   polystyrene nanoparticles, to produce qualitative characterization of
   the ingestion of MP or NP and tissue distributions in relatively
   transparent aquatic organisms.(11−13) However, the use of fluorescent
   particles has a number of disadvantages, including high limits of
   detection (often in the range mg L^–1), interferences from fluorescent
   background signals, the limited range of applicable organisms and
   rather weak resolution (e.g., due to internal light
   diffraction/reflection). The challenges of tracking plastic particles
   in biological or environmental media (including the need for lower
   limits of detection) have therefore impeded quantification of uptake
   and accumulation at environmentally realistic concentrations, thus far.
   Stable and radioisotope techniques have recently been used successfully
   to study the fate of nonplastics nanoparticles at environmentally
   relevant concentrations.(14−16) In principle, this approach could also
   be used to study fundamental and largely unexplored questions
   concerning ingestion, depuration and tissue distributions (i.e.,
   translocation) of nanoplastic particles by, and in, organisms.(17)
   Indeed, radiolabeled nonplastics nanoparticles have been used to
   overcome the significant limitations for quantifying nanomaterials in
   environmental and biological media(15,18−20) and to facilitate work at
   low limits of detection. For instance, radiolabeled silver
   nanoparticles (nAg) were developed for quantifying and visualizing the
   distribution of particles in mollusks following exposures at
   concentrations as low as 100 ng L^–1 by quantitative whole body
   autoradiography (QWBA).(14) Such, techniques offer the possibility for
   direct visualization of intraorgan nanoparticle concentrations.
   Unfortunately, radiolabeled nanoplastics are not currently available,
   to our knowledge.
   In the present study, we synthesized ^14C-labeled nanopolystyrene
   particles (24 and 250 nm), and then exposed scallops to these
   particles, measured the biokinetics and quantified NP tissue
   distributions via QWBA. We used environmentally realistic NP
   concentrations (15 ppb) to test the hypothesis that this commercially
   important mollusk might uptake, absorb, and depurate, NP differently
   according to size. For each particle size, scallops were exposed to a
   single pulse (6 h) of radiolabeled NP in seawater in the presence of
   food. Exposed and control animals were sampled over time (i.e., during
   48 days) to track NP and to quantify particle distribution.

Synthesis, Radiolabeling, and Particle Characterizations

   Radioactive styrene [methylene-(14)] (American radiolabeled chemicals
   Inc., ARC, Saint-Louis, MO) with a nominal specific activity of 2.22
   GBq mmol^–1 was used to synthesize two batches of spherical polystyrene
   nanoparticles with sizes of approximately 24 ± 13 and 248 ± 21 nm,
   hereafter described as nPS[24] and nPS[250], following the procedures
   used by Ming et al.(21) and Telford et al.,(22) respectively, for
   synthesis of nonradiolabeled nanopolystyrene (nPS). As the behavior of
   nanoparticles can be influenced by their shape, spherical nPS were
   prepared so as to be comparable with most previous laboratory-based
   studies on uptake of plastic particles (SI Figure S1). Unreacted
   monomer was removed by ultrafiltration (exclusion size of membrane:
   30 000 g mol^–1). The average size and ζ-potential and the
   polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer particles were measured using
   a multiangle Nicomp ZLS Z3000 (Particle Sizing System, Port Richey,
   FL). Particle morphology was observed by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM; JEOL 1400), at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.
   Composition was characterized by Fourier Transform InfraRed
   spectroscopy (Alpha II FTIR, Bruker).

Organisms

   Pecten maximus (n = 108, hermaphrodite, shell height 115 ± 16 mm and
   width 100 ± 13 mm, soft tissue weight 73 ± 16 g), were collected by
   divers in Plymouth Sound (United Kingdom, 50° 21.292’ N, 004° 09.474’
   W). Before the experiment, the scallops were acclimated for 2 weeks in
   a 400 L aquarium provided with running seawater (flow rate about 10 L
   min^–1). Water temperature was 12–13 °C and salinity 30–32 PSU
   throughout acclimation and experiment periods. Scallops were fed daily
   with a suspension of phytoplankton, which was a mix of Isochrysis spp.,
   Pavlova spp., Tetraselmis, Chaetoceros calcitrans, Thalassiosira
   weissflogii, and Thalassiosira pseudonana (2 × 10^9 cells mL^–1; ca.
   4–20 μm, shellfish diet 1800) at 3% of the dry weight of the animal
   tissue. The wet weight of each individual was recorded before the start
   of the exposures.

Exposure Protocol

   Scallops were starved for 2 days prior to exposure. A mixture of algae
   and radioactive nPS (either nPS[24] or nPS[250]) was added to glass
   aquaria (50 L containing 20 L of aerated and filtered seawater) 1.5 h
   and 45 min, respectively, before adding groups of 12 scallops. Nominal
   ^14C water concentrations were 5 kBq ^14C L^–1, which represented 15 μg
   L^–1 of nPS. The scallops were given a 6 h pulse exposure.
   Subsequently, scallops were placed in clean 60 L tanks with flowing
   seawater for a depuration period of 48 days. Temperature, salinity, and
   daily feeding were maintained as above.

Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC)

   Samples of water and soft tissue of scallops were collected during the
   6 h uptake period in order to determine a mass balance between water
   and tissue. Radioactivity in the water was measured in a 10 mL sample
   using LSC at 1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 h. Scallop soft-tissue was sampled at
   2, 4.5, and 6 h. On each occasion, samples were collected in
   triplicate. ^14C-activity was also measured during the depuration
   period in the scallops at 1, 2, 3, 8, 14, 24, and 48 days. Soft-tissues
   were removed from the shells and digested according to the method of
   Thomson and Burns.(23) Prior to total ^14C-measurements by LSC, 10 mL
   of Ultima Gold cocktail was added to each sample (including water and
   soft tissue samples) and samples were kept in the dark for 24 h to
   avoid any chemioluminescence quenching. Samples were measured using a
   Hidex 300SL counter at the Gordon Institute, University of Cambridge
   (U.K.), (10 min counting time, minimum detectable activity (MDA) =
   limit of detection (LOD) 0.08 Bq mL^–1; SI eq S1). Background count
   rates were determined by counting samples from the control exposure
   (i.e., water and scallops from aquaria to which no nPS particles had
   been added).

Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography (QWBA)

   The distribution of particles in tissues was visualized using QWBA on
   two scallops from each group at the end of the exposure period (i.e.,
   after 6 h of uptake), after 8 days of depuration and after 48 days of
   depuration. Soft tissues were detached from the shell, embedded in a
   2.5% (p/v) aqueous gel of carboxymethylcellulose and flash-frozen in
   liquid nitrogen. The resulting block was cut at −25 °C with a specially
   designed cryomicrotome (Leica CM3600). A pair of 50 μm thick tissue
   sections was collected every 0.75 mm, freeze-dried and exposed for 3
   weeks on a phosphor screen. The screens were scanned with a phosphor
   imager Typhoon FLA7000 (GE Healthcare) to obtain images of the ^14C
   distribution. Areas of interest were isolated, and radioactivity
   quantified as digital light unit per mm^2 of tissue section (DLU mm^–2)
   with ImageJ. These values were corrected for exposure time on phosphor
   screens, normalized for an exposure concentration of 5 kBq L^–1 and
   expressed as a signal/noise ratio (S/N) to correct for background BG
   (in DLU mm^–2 h^–1) as described by Al-Sid-Cheikh et al.(14) using R
   script treatment. Calibration blood dots were added to each screen to
   permit quantification in units of Bq g^–1, ng g^–1 and particles g^–1.

Kinetic Models of Accumulation

   Accumulation in the animal (dC[A]/dt) is related to the concentration
   in water (C[W]), and an uptake rate constant (k[upt]) and can be
   expressed as
   Elimination was modeled according to the following biexponential
   equation: where C[t] corresponds to the percentage of radioactivity
   remaining at time t, relative to radioactivity measured at t[0]; C[1]
   and C[2] represent the percentage of radioactivity in the fast (C[1])
   and slow (C[2]) kinetics compartments at t[0] (C[1] + C[2] = t[0] =
   100); k[e1] and k[e2] correspond to the elimination rates in the fast
   and slow kinetics compartments, respectively. Uptake and elimination
   parameters (i.e., k[upt], C[1], C[2], k[e1] and k[e2]) were determined
   using the method of Borretzen and Salbu,(24) as described by
   Al-Sid-Cheikh et al.(14) using R. The long-term bioconcentration factor
   (BCF) of ^14C, nPS[24, 250] was modeled as described by Al-Sid-Cheikh
   et al.(14) BCF is the quantity of NP in each scallop at time t
   expressed as a bioconcentration factor. All k[upt] of ^14C were
   compared between groups using t tests.

Uptake

   Both 24 and 250 nm nanopolystyrene (nPS) accumulated in P. maximus
   during the pulse exposures (Figure 1a). During this 6 h period, the
   scallops accumulated 30% and 15% of the available NP burden in the
   medium, for nPS[24] and nPS[250], respectively (Figure 1a, SI Table
   S1). The data shown in Figure 1a indicate that nPS[24] was taken up 2.5
   times faster (p-value < 0.001, t test, n = 6) than nPS[250] with uptake
   values of 0.5 ± 0.08 and 0.2 ± 0.01 Bq h^–1 (SI Table S2),
   respectively. Consequently, at these rates, the accumulation capacity
   (i.e., here define as 95% of the scallop capacity) would be reached
   after 11 and 30 h of continued exposures for nPS[24] and nPS[250]

Depuration

   For both particle sizes, the majority of nPS were depurated within 3
   days (Figure 1b, c). Specifically, during the first compartment of
   depuration, 88 and 68% of the initial burdens were purged for nPS[24]
   and nPS[250], respectively, with a similar elimination rate (k[e1]) and
   biological half-life (t[1/2]) of about 1.4 days (Table S3). The main
   difference between particle sizes occurred during the subsequent
   depuration compartment, where the rates (k[e2;]t[1/2] = 35 and 64 d)
   were 25 and 50 times slower than for the first stage (k[e1]) for
   nPS[24]and nPS[250], respectively. That is, depuration kinetics were
   slower for nPS[250] than for nPS[24]. The LSC limit of detection was
   reached after 14 days of depuration for nPS[24] particles, while
   nPS[250] particles were still detectable after 48 day depuration
   (Figure 1b, c).

Tissue Distributions

   The distribution of nPS[24] within scallops after the 6 h exposure to a
   single pulse was revealed by QWBA (Figure 2a; SI Figures S3 and S4).
   Quantification showed that after 6 h, nPS[24] was distributed in the
   hepatopancreas (1579.5 ± 35 ng), gills (1385.7 ± 400 ng), gonad (913.9
   ± 16 ng), muscle (863.0 ± 19 ng, kidney (328.7 ± 15 ng), intestine
   (226.8 ± 16 ng), and anus (163. Two ±22 ng) (Figure 2b, SI Table S4).
   After 8 days of elimination, nPS[24] was still detectable (Figure 2c).
   The amounts remaining at this stage (Figure 2d, SI Table S4) were 556.8
   ± 171 ng (gills), 324.6 ± 31 ng (hepatopancreas), 149.6 ± 211 ng
   (muscle), 148.7 ± 97 ng (gonads), 35.9 ± 24 ng (kidney), and 13.0 ±
   18.4 ng (anus). After 14 days, ^14C levels of nPS[24] were below the
   limit of detection of QWBA, in agreement with the LSC measurements. The
   activity recorded by QWBA for scallops exposed to nPS[250] was
   significantly lower than those for nPS[250] (consistent with slower and
   reduced uptake of nPS[250] of this size) and was only detectable as a
   single spot of activity in the intestine (SI Figure S2). Any activity
   in the anus, hepatopancreas, kidney, intestine, gonad, gills, and
   muscle was below the limit of detection.

Bioaccumulation

   Long-term chronic exposure model predictions were generated from the
   results of the single-pulse experiment. Bioconcentration factors (BCF)
   representing the quantity of nPS[24] and nPS[250] in the scallops at
   time t, expressed as the BCF in mL exposure water g^–1[ww], (as
   indicated in Materials and Methods), were calculated. The model outputs
   indicated (Figure 3; SI Figure S4), that the concentration of nPS[24]
   in the scallops would increase faster than nPS[250] during the first
   60–100 days of exposure and would then reach a steady state after
   around 200 d. BCF[250] was calculated to increase more slowly in the
   first 60–70 days but was predicted to reach a steady-state after around
   300 days (Figure 3). Bioaccumulation modeling predicted that during
   chronic exposures, nPS[250] would become more bioconcentrated in P.
   maximus than nPS[24]. Consequently, the predicted concentrations
   (Figure 3) after a year would be 1.8 and 2.7 mg g^–1 (wet weight) for
   nPS[24] and nPS[250] in P. maximus, for a constant environmental
   concentration of 15 μg L^–1. Alternatively, when the model is applied
   to a constant environmental concentration of 100 ng L^–1 instead, the
   predicted concentration accumulated by P. maximus decreased to 12 and
   18 μg g^–1 for nPS[24] and nPS[250], respectively. At a concentration
   of 1 pg L^–1, the model predicted tissue concentrations of 123 and 178
   ng g^–1, for nPS[24] and nPS[250], respectively.

Environmentally Relevant Concentrations

   This study reports biokinetic and tissue distribution data for nPS at
   what have been predicted previously as possible environmentally
   realistic concentrations of nanoplastics.(9) Use of radiolabeled
   nanoparticles allowed demonstration of tissue distributions and
   biokinetics. By exposing scallops to a single pulse of nPS particles,
   our experiments showed that even at a concentration of 15 μg L^–1,
   plastic particles accumulated rapidly in the scallop (Figure 1a). Once
   transferred to clean seawater, the radioactive particles were depurated
   relatively rapidly (Figure 1b). The potential for some nPS[24]
   detectable by QWBA, but not detectable nPS[250] particles, to transfer
   via the circulatory system is also suggested somewhat by the data,
   which apparently show the presence of nPS[24] in muscles. This
   emphasizes the advantages of using radiolabeling techniques. These may
   now be used to investigate the distribution of NP particles at
   relatively low concentrations to other organisms and during longer-term
   exposures in order to reach steady states at environmentally realistic
   concentrations and with modeling perhaps to provide useful information
   on the potential chronic fate of NP.

Ingestion of Nanopolystyrene

   Bivalves are generally capable of discriminating between algal cells of
   different sizes by a pseudofeces rejection mechanism.(25) The retention
   pattern for particles below 5–7 μm varies somewhat between species. For
   example, Chlamys islandica is more efficient in capturing small
   particles than Chlamys opercularis.(25) Some scallops, such as
   Pectinidae, are capable of ingesting larger particles (up to 950
   μm(26)). This ability has been related to the apparent absence of a
   sorting mechanism based on particle sizes.(27) Nevertheless, an upper
   limit for capture/ingestion of particles of approximately 20 μm for
   adult scallops has been suggested.(28) Our experiments show a size
   effect at much smaller sizes, on the uptake rate of nPS by P. maximus.
   nPS[24] was taken up 2.5 times faster than nPS[250.] These results are
   in agreement with a previous experiment exposing 20 and 80 nm
   radiolabeled silver nanoparticles (i.e., n^110mAg[20–80]) to the
   scallop C. islandica under similar conditions.(14) Indeed, nPS[24]
   accumulated at a similar rate to n^110mAg[20], while n^110mAg[80] was
   ingested at a slower rate than observed for nPS[250]. Three levels of
   specialization are generally suggested to explain the variability in
   particle processing by bivalves: morphological (different pallial organ
   configurations corresponding to differences in processing sites and
   mechanisms), biochemical (different mucopolysaccharide types
   accomplishing different processing functions) and ciliary, with
   specific ciliary types affecting different functions, such as particle
   interception or various types of transport.(29) We suggest that one, or
   all, these mechanisms (most probably pallial organ configuration and a
   ciliary level of specialization), may be less effective for nanoscale
   particles. The difference between the ingestion rate of smaller and
   larger nPS could possibly also be explained by differences in
   sedimentation and agglomeration rates of the particles, which would
   affect their availability to the scallops. For example, Ward and
   Kach(30) observed that marine aggregates facilitated the ingestion of
   nPS[100] in oysters and mussels. In a similar way, White(31) (1997)
   found that flocculation increased the ability of adult Placopecten
   magellanicus to retain small (<7 μm) clay particles. If the smaller nPS
   agglomerate and precipitate faster than the bigger NP, smaller nPS
   might have become more accessible to the scallop. Recently, it has been
   suggested that bivalves might also uptake plastic particles through
   adherence, in addition to traditional ingestion.(32) This alternative
   absorption mechanism is likely to occur during quick depuration
   processes and indicates that plastic particles could relocate in
   bivalves via the action of the foot and the mantle.

Depuration of Nanopolystyrene

   Particle selection in the gut or in the digestive gland-stomach of
   bivalves is complex and not well understood. It is thought that some
   bivalves can discriminate among particles in the gut and can
   preferentially adsorb nutritional particles.(33−35) Post ingestion
   discrimination is thought to occur, either by the preferential
   retention of some particles in the stomach, allowing more time for
   extracellular digestion, or by the direction of some particles toward
   the digestive gland for intracellular digestion.(25) In the present
   experiment, the first step of the depuration process (i.e., where more
   than 65% of the initial burden was purged), showed relatively high
   depuration rates; approximately 13 times faster for both sizes of nPS
   than those previously observed with n^110mAg[20]^14. P magellanicus
   has, for example, been shown to distinguish between particles of
   different size and density and to retain larger and lighter particles
   longer.(36) Such size and composition selection require energy
   consumption. However, little is known about the associated energy
   costs.(25) Nevertheless, the presence of NP might represent an
   important energy cost. For example, in bivalves such as Mytilus edulis,
   the excretory loss of nitrogenous products can represent up to 31% of
   respiratory energy demand.(37)

Tissue Distribution of Particles

   Tissue distribution is of key importance for evaluation of the
   potential for particles translocation within an organism and thus for
   future understanding of any toxicological effects and transfer within
   the food web.(38) Translocation may increase residence time,
   bioaccumulation and create long-term effects in organisms.(17)
   Fluorescent labeling has been widely used to track contaminants in
   environmental compartments (e.g., refs (11and39)). However, this
   approach has major restrictions, such as the limit of detection, the
   type of organisms that can be used (i.e., a relatively transparent
   organisms), fluorescent responses from background material and the poor
   optical resolution (e.g., due to internal light
   diffraction/reflection). Studies have produced qualitative
   characterization of ingestion of MP/NP in relatively transparent
   organisms.(11−13) The tissue distribution of nPS[24] in Pecten maximus
   suggests ingestion and accumulation in the digestive cavity and tubules
   and translocation into the circulatory system from which radioactive
   particles reached the gonad, kidney and muscle (Figure 2). The presence
   of NP in muscle tissue perhaps indicates that some particles had
   crossed epithelial membranes. Our results with nPS[24] show contrasting
   tissue distributions to previous observations with n^110mAg[20], which
   were mostly distributed in the hepatopancreas (including a “hot spot”
   in the gastric shield). This comparison between nanoparticles of
   similar sizes, but different compositions (nanopolystyrene versus
   nanosilver), suggests that tissue distributions might be influenced by
   the type of nanoparticles. These observations suggest that the chemical
   composition of the nanomaterials may have important effects on their
   behavior in biological systems, perhaps due to differences in physical
   chemistry. The relatively homogeneous distribution of nPS[24] compared
   to that observed for n^110mAg[20], as well as the relatively higher
   accumulation of nPS[24] than nPS[250] in the hepatopancreas and kidney
   and its rapid disappearance from the gills, suggest stronger
   translocation of nPS[24] than nPS[250] and different depuration
   mechanisms. Nanoparticles are likely to follow the same uptake routes
   as suspended food particles, which are normally trapped in mucus and
   transported toward the digestive gland by ciliary action.(29) The
   binding of nPS[24,250] by mucus proteins and transport by this same
   route cannot be excluded, but it is not possible with the present data
   to determine the contribution of this route compared to possible uptake
   via the gills. Furthermore, contrary to previous work with
   n^110mAg[20], the presence of nPS[24] in kidney, heart, and muscle
   suggests possible translocation to the circulatory system, which might
   be explained by capability to cross-epithelial walls and cell membranes
   (i.e., lipid membranes)(40) or indirect transportation by hemocytes
   after absorption.(41)

       Microscopic plastic fragments and fibers are widespread in the
       world ocean, accumulating in the pelagic zone and sedimentary
       habitats. Fragments appear to have resulted from degrdn. of larger
       items. Plastics of this size are ingested by marine organisms, but
       environmental consequences of this contamination are unknown. Due
       to its resistance to biodegrdn. but susceptibility to mech. action,
       there is considerable potential for large-scale accumulation of
       microscopic plastic debris. To quantify the abundance of
       micro-plastics, sediment was collected from beaches and estuarine
       and sub-tidal sediment near Plymouth, UK. Nine polymers were
       conclusively identified: acrylic, alkyd, poly(ethylene:propylene),
       polyamide (nylon), polyester, polyethylene, polymethylacrylate,
       polypropylene, and poly vinyl alc. Given their wide range of uses,
       it is suggested the fragments resulted from larger item breakdown.
       To further assess the extent of contamination, another 17 beaches
       were examd. Similar fibers were obsd., demonstrating that
       microscopic plastics are common in sedimentary habitats. To assess
       long-term trends of abundance, plankton samples collected regularly
       since the 1960s between Aberdeen and the Shetland Islands and from
       Sule Skerry to Iceland, were analyzed. Plastic was archived among
       plankton in samples back to the 1960s, but with a significant
       increase in abundance over time. Similar types of polymer in the
       water column and sediment suggested polymer d. was not a major
       factor affecting distribution. Some fragments were granular, but
       most were fibrous, ∼20 μm in diam., and brightly colored. Results
       demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this type
       of contamination. Given the rapid increase in plastic prodn., its
       longevity and disposable nature, this contamination is likely to
       increase.

       The release of plastics into the environment has been identified as
       an important issue for some time. Recent publications have
       suggested that the degrdn. of plastic materials will result in the
       release of nano-sized plastic particles to the environment.
       Nanoparticle tracking anal. was applied to characterize the
       formation of nanoplastics during the degrdn. of a polystyrene (PS)
       disposable coffee cup lid. The results clearly show an increase in
       the formation of nanoplastics over time. After 56 days' exposure
       the concn. of nanoplastics in the PS sample was 1.26 × 108
       particles/mL (av. particles size 224 nm) compared to 0.41 × 108
       particles/mL in the control.

       In this work, we present for the first time undeniable evidence of
       nano-plastic occurrence due to solar light degrdn. of marine
       micro-plastics under controlled and environmentally representative
       conditions. As obsd. during our recent expedition (Expedition 7th
       Continent), plastic pollution will be one of the most challenging
       ecol. threats for the next generation. Up to now, all studies have
       focused on the environmental and the economic impact of millimeter
       scale plastics. These plastics can be visualized, collected and
       studied. We are not aware of any studies reporting the
       possibilities of nano-plastics in marine water. Here, we developed
       for the first time a new solar reactor equipped with a nanoparticle
       detector to investigate the possibility of the formation of
       nano-plastics from millimeter scale plastics. With this system,
       correlated with electronic microscopy observations, we identified
       for the first time the presence of plastics at the nanoscale in
       water due to UV degrdn. Based on our observations, large fractal
       nano-plastic particles (i.e., >100 nm) are produced by UV light
       after the initial formation of the smallest nano-plastic particles
       (i.e., <100 nm). These new results show the potential hazards of
       plastic waste at the nanoscale, which had not been taken into
       account previously.

       To document the marketing and distribution of nano-enabled products
       into the com. marketplace, the Woodrow Wilson International Center
       for Scholars and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies created
       the Nanotechnol. Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) in 2005. The
       objective of this present work is to redevelop the CPI by leading a
       research effort to increase the usefulness and reliability of this
       inventory. We created eight new descriptors for consumer products,
       including information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in
       each product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a
       diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and
       state/federal government had become highly dependent on the
       inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the
       pervasiveness of nanotechnol. in society. We interviewed 68
       nanotechnol. experts to assess key information needs. Their answers
       guided inventory modifications by providing a clear conceptual
       framework best suited for user expectations. The revised inventory
       was released in Oct. 2013. It currently lists 1814 consumer
       products from 622 companies in 32 countries. The Health and Fitness
       category contains the most products (762, or 42% of the total).
       Silver is the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or
       24%); however, 49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not
       provide the compn. of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of
       the CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a variety
       of liq. media and dermal contact is the most likely exposure
       scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products, or 71%) of
       the products do not present enough supporting information to
       corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are used. The modified CPI
       has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities, which allow users to
       suggest edits to any entry and permits researchers to upload new
       findings ranging from human and environmental exposure data to
       complete life cycle assessments. There are inherent limitations to
       this type of database, but these modifications to the inventory
       addressed the majority of criticisms raised in published literature
       and in surveys of nanotechnol. stakeholders and experts. The
       development of standardized methods and metrics for nanomaterial
       characterization and labeling in consumer products can lead to
       greater understanding between the key stakeholders in nanotechnol.,
       esp. consumers, researchers, regulators, and industry.

       Fragmentation of plastic debris and the com. use of plastic
       microbeads have led to the widespread distribution of microplastics
       in natural environments. Several studies have reported on the
       occurrence and toxicity of microplastics in soils and waters;
       however, because of methodol. challenges, the presence and impact
       of nanoplastics (<100 nm) in natural systems have been largely
       ignored. Microbeads used in consumer products such as scrubs and
       shampoos are processed by mech. means that may lead to their
       fragmentation into potentially more hazardous nanoplastics. In this
       study, three com. facial scrubs contg. polyethylene microbeads
       (∼0.2 mm diam.) were examd. to verify whether they contained
       nanoplastics. Particulates in the scrubs were fractionated using
       sequential filtration to isolate <100 nm particles. SEM was used to
       confirm the presence of nanoparticles ranging in size from 24 ± 6
       to 52 ± 14 nm. XPS and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy were used
       to confirm that the identified nanoparticles consisted of
       polyethylene. This study confirms the (unexpected) presence of
       nanoplastics in personal care products contg. polyethylene
       microbeads and highlights the need for further studies to
       characterize the release and distribution of nanoplastic litter in
       natural aquatic and soil environments.

       Small plastic detritus, termed microplastics, are a widespread and
       ubiquitous contaminant of marine ecosystems across the globe.
       Ingestion of microplastics by marine biota, including mussels,
       worms, fish, and seabirds, has been widely reported, but despite
       their vital ecol. role in marine food-webs, the impact of
       microplastics on zooplankton remains under-researched. We show that
       microplastics are ingested by, and may impact upon, zooplankton. We
       used bioimaging techniques to document ingestion, egestion, and
       adherence of microplastics in a range of zooplankton common to the
       northeast Atlantic, and used feeding rate studies to det. the
       impact of plastic detritus on algal ingestion rates in copepods.
       Using fluorescence and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS)
       microscopy we identified that 13 zooplankton taxa had the capacity
       to ingest 1.7-30.6 μm polystyrene beads, with uptake varying by
       taxa, life-stage and bead-size. Post-ingestion, copepods egested
       fecal pellets laden with microplastics. We further obsd.
       microplastics adhered to the external carapace and appendages of
       exposed zooplankton. Exposure of the copepod Centropages typicus to
       natural assemblages of algae with and without microplastics showed
       that 7.3 μm microplastics (>4000/mL) significantly decreased algal
       feeding. Our findings imply that marine microplastic debris can
       neg. impact upon zooplankton function and health.

       Polystyrene nanoplastics inhibit reproduction and induce abnormal
       embryonic development in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia galeata
       Cui Rongxue; Kim Shin Woong; An Youn-Joo
       Scientific reports (2017), 7 (1), 12095 ISSN:.
       We assayed the toxicity of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP, 52 nm)
       to Daphnia galeata. Survival and reproduction were significantly
       decreased in individuals exposed to 5 mg/L of PS-NP for 5 days, and
       embryos showed abnormal development, including a low hatching rate.
       Using fluorescence confocal microscopy, we recorded the transfer of
       PS-NP from the external surface of the body to the internal organs,
       including the thoracic appendices, ovaries, caudal appendices, and
       brood chamber, as well as PS-NP storage in lipid droplets. Although
       embryos were exposed to PS-NP in the brood chamber, they did not
       internalize PS-NP. Exposed D. galeata adults that were not pregnant
       stored significantly fewer lipid droplets than did the control
       group, and the lipid droplets that they did store were smaller;
       meanwhile, there were no significant changes in lipid storage in
       exposed pregnant individuals. Some embryos showed a high level of
       lipid storage, a response that occurs when embryos experience an
       abnormal state, and these embryos showed a very low hatching rate.
       However, the offspring of exposed adults showed normal survival and
       lipid storage. This study provides visual evidence that confirms
       the transfer and effects of PS-NP in Daphnia species, and suggests
       a relationship between toxicity and lipid storage.

       Contamination of fine plastic particles (FPs), including micrometer
       to millimeter plastics (MPs) and nanometer plastics (NPs), in the
       environment has caught great concerns. FPs are strong adsorbents
       for hydrophobic toxic pollutants and may affect their fate and
       toxicity in the environment; however, such information is still
       rare. We studied joint toxicity of FPs with phenanthrene to Daphnia
       magna and effects of FPs on the environmental fate and
       bioaccumulation of 14C-phenanthrene in fresh water. Within the five
       sizes particles we tested (from 50 nm to 10 μm), 50-nm NPs showed
       significant toxicity and phys. damage to D. magna. The joint
       toxicity of 50-nm NPs and phenanthrene to D. magna showed an
       additive effect. During a 14-days incubation, the presence of NPs
       significantly enhanced bioaccumulation of phenanthrene-derived
       residues in daphnid body and inhibited the dissipation and
       transformation of phenanthrene in the medium, while 10-μm MPs did
       not show significant effects on the bioaccumulation, dissipation,
       and transformation of phenanthrene. The differences may be
       attributed to higher adsorption of phenanthrene on 50-nm NPs than
       10-μm MPs. Our findings underlined the high potential ecol. risks
       of FPs, and suggested that NPs should be given more concerns, in
       terms of their interaction with hydrophobic pollutants in the
       environment.

       The fast expansion of the global nanotechnol. market entails a
       higher environmental and human exposure to nanomaterials. Ag
       nanoparticles (AgNP) are used for their antibacterial properties;
       however, their environmental fate is yet poorly understood. Iceland
       scallops (Chlamys islandica) were exposed for 12 h to 3 different
       Ag forms, dissolved Ag(I) (Agdiss), small (S-NP, Φ = 10-20 nm) and
       large AgNP (L-NP, Φ = 70-80 nm), labeled with 110mAg, and
       bioaccumulation kinetics and tissue distribution using in vivo γ
       counting and whole-body autoradiog. were detd. All Ag forms were
       readily and rapidly accumulated. Elimination process was also fast
       and bi-exponential, with mean biol. half-life ranging from 1.4 to
       4.3 days and from 17 to 50 days for fast and slow compartments,
       resp. Most of the radioactivity concd. in the hepatopancreas.
       Agdiss and S-NP tissue distributions were similar indicating a
       rapid dissoln. of the latter in the tissues, contrarily to L-NP
       which appeared to form long lasting aggregates in the digestive
       system. Estd. steady-state bioconcn. factors (BCF), ranging between
       2700 and 3800 mL g-1 for dissolved and particulate silver forms,
       showed that C. islandica can accumulate significant quantities of
       Ag in a short time followed by an efficient depuration process.

       Ag nanoparticles (AgNP) are ever-more being used in industrial
       processes and consumer products, resulting in increasing emissions
       to the environment. To understand AgNP behavior and environmental
       fate, it is paramount they can be traced in complex natural samples
       from exposure at high sensitivity. Stable isotope labeling is
       ideally suited for this purpose. To support such applications, a
       detailed evaluation of techniques to prep. stable isotope-labeled
       AgNP and demonstration that isotopically-modified particles are
       only distinguishable from particles with a natural isotope compn.
       by their strong isotopic signature, is presented. Monodisperse
       suspensions of citrate-stabilized AgNP of target sizes of 17, 20,
       and 30 nm were synthesized by reducing AgNO3 solns. with NaBH4.
       AgNP suspensions were produced using natural Ag, comprised of 2
       stable isotopes (107Ag [52%] and 109Ag [48%]), and Ag enriched to
       99.2% in 107Ag. Synthesis was reliably reproduced on 3 sep.
       occasions in 2 labs. AgNP were characterized by dynamic light
       scattering shortly after synthesis and after up to 12 mo storage.
       Some batches were also characterized by transmission electron
       microscopy and asym. flow field-flow fractionation. Particle size
       distributions showed good reproducibility between labs. and
       stability over 12 mo storage. 107Ag-enriched particles were
       indistinguishable in size and shape from particles with natural
       isotope compn. Reliability, particle size control, and high yield
       (∼80%) demonstrated the synthesis technique is well suited for
       small-scale prodn. of isotopically-labeled AgNP. Isotope mass
       balance calcns. showed the use of labeling enables AgNP tracing
       sensitivities which are at least 40 times, and possibly up to 4000
       times, higher than those achievable with bulk Ag concn.
       measurements, and expts. with exposure concns. approaching
       predicted environmental levels are possible, if the most precise
       isotopic measurement techniques are used.

       Plastics debris is accumulating in the environment and is
       fragmenting into smaller pieces; as it does, the potential for
       ingestion by animals increases. The consequences of macroplastic
       debris for wildlife are well documented, however the impacts of
       microplastic (<1 mm) are poorly understood. The mussel, Mytilus
       edulis, was used to investigate ingestion, translocation, and
       accumulation of this debris. Initial expts. showed that upon
       ingestion, microplastic accumulated in the gut. Mussels were
       subsequently exposed to treatments contg. seawater and microplastic
       (3.0 or 9.6 μm). After transfer to clean conditions, microplastic
       was tracked in the hemolymph. Particles translocated from the gut
       to the circulatory system within 3 days and persisted for over 48
       days. Abundance of microplastic was greatest after 12 days and
       declined thereafter. Smaller particles were more abundant than
       larger particles and our data indicate as plastic fragments into
       smaller particles, the potential for accumulation in the tissues of
       an organism increases. The short-term pulse exposure used here did
       not result in significant biol. effects. However, plastics are
       exceedingly durable and so further work using a wider range of
       organisms, polymers, and periods of exposure will be required to
       establish the biol. consequences of this debris.

       BACKGROUND: Carbon nanotubes represent a class of nanomaterials
       having broad application potentials and documented cellular uptake
       and ecotoxicol. effects that raise the possibility that they may
       bioaccumulate in living organisms. OBJECTIVES: Radioactively
       labeled nanotubes were synthesized using a novel methane chem.
       vapor deposition procedure. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs),
       multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and pyrene were spiked to
       sediment samples, and the resp. uptake and depuration of these
       nanotubes and pyrene were assessed by the oligochaete, Lumbriculus
       variegatus. RESULTS: 14C-labeled carbon nanotubes were developed
       for these expts. to overcome significant previous limitations for
       quantifying nanotube materials in environmental and biol. media.
       Biota-sediment accumulation factors for SWNTs and MWNTs were obsd.
       to be almost an order of magnitude lower than those for pyrene, a
       four-ringed polycyclic arom. hydrocarbon (PAH). The depuration
       behaviors of the oligochaete suggested that the nanotubes detected
       in these organisms were assocd. with sediments remaining in the
       organism guts and not absorbed into cellular tissues as was the
       pyrene. The results suggest that, unlike PAHs, purified carbon
       nanotubes do not readily absorb into organism tissues.

       A new method allowing the 14C-labeling of carboxylic acid functions
       of carbon nanotubes is described. The key step of the labeling
       process is a decarbonylation reaction that has been developed and
       optimized with the help of a screening method. The optimized
       process has been successfully applied to multiwalled carbon
       nanotubes (MWNTs), and the corresponding 14C-labeled nanotubes were
       used to investigate their in vivo behavior. Preliminary results
       obtained after i.v. contamination of rats revealed liver as the
       main target organ. Radiolabeling of NTs with a long-life
       radioactive nucleus like 14C, coupled to a highly sensitive
       autoradiog. method, that provides a unique detection threshold,
       will make it possible to det. for a long time period whether or not
       NTs remain in any organs after animal exposure.

       Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and its
       potential impacts to wildlife and humans present a growing global
       concern. Despite recent efforts in understanding environmental
       impacts assocd. with plastic pollution, considerable uncertainties
       still exist regarding the true risks of nano- and micro-sized
       plastics (<5 mm). The challenges faced in this field largely relate
       to the methodol. and anal. limitations assocd. with studying
       plastic debris at low (environmentally relevant) concns. The
       present paper highlights how radiotracing techniques that are
       commonly applied to trace the fate and behavior of chems. and
       particles in various systems, can contribute towards addressing
       several important and outstanding questions in environmental
       plastic pollution research. Specifically, we discuss the use of
       radiolabeled microplastics and/or chems. for 1) detg.
       sorption/desorption kinetics of a range of contaminants to
       different types of plastics under varying conditions, 2)
       understanding the influence of microplastics on contaminant and
       nutrient bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, and 3) assessing
       biokinetics, biodistribution, trophic transfer and potential biol.
       impacts of microplastic at realistic concns. Radiotracer techniques
       are uniquely suited for this research because of their sensitivity,
       accuracy and capacity to measure relevant parameters over time.
       Obtaining precise and timely information on the fate of plastic
       particles and co-contaminants in wildlife has widespread
       applications towards effective monitoring programs and
       environmental management strategies.

       Two kinds of styrene microemulsion systems were polymd. to prep.
       polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS), one emulsified by Na dodecyl
       sulfate (SDS) and coemulsified by 1-pentanol and the other
       emulsified by octylphenoxypoly(ethoxyethanol) (OP-10). Micro-PS
       possessed an essentially atactic configuration based on 1H-NMR
       measurement. Comparison of IR spectra showed some conformational
       differences between micro-PS and ordinary atactic PS (o-PS). Each
       polystyrene microsphere contains only about 3 macromol. chains
       (so-called pauci-chain microspheres), which adopt a special
       conformation: individual chains are highly compact, while the whole
       structure of the microsphere is relatively loose in comparison with
       a random-coil chain in a multichain system. There were apparent
       differences in thermal behaviors between micro-PS and o-PS during
       the DSC scan. Micro-PS displayed 2 exotherms near 107 and 157°
       during the first scan. In the subsequent scan, both exotherms
       disappeared and only one glass transition similar to o-PS was
       found. The first exotherm might be due to the sintering of
       polystyrene microspheres with small particle sizes. From wide-angle
       X-ray diffraction and polarizing optical microscopy studies, the
       second exotherm could be ascribed to the relatively compact
       conformation of polystyrene chains and the consequently formed
       slightly ordered regions inside micro-PS during the heating
       process. The special conformation was the driving force leading to
       its novel thermal behaviors. This is perhaps the first report that
       polystyrene from direct radical polymn. has the ability to form
       some kind of ordered structure.

       Sediments can act as a sink for contaminants in effluents from
       industrial and nuclear installations or when released from dumped
       waste. However, contaminated sediments may also act as a potential
       source of radionuclides and trace metals to the water phase due to
       remobilization of metals as dissolved species and resuspension of
       particles. The marine mussel Mytilus edulis is a filter-feeding
       organism that via the gills is subjected to contaminants in
       dissolved form and from contaminants assocd. to suspended particles
       via the digestive system. The bioavailability of sediment-assocd.
       and seawater dild. Cs, Co, Cd and Zn radioactive tracers to the
       filtering bivalve M. edulis was examd. The mussels were exposed to
       tracers dild. in ultrafiltered (<10 KDa) seawater (low mol. mass
       form) or to tracers assocd. with sediment particles from the
       Stepovogo Fjord at Novaya Zemlya in short-term uptake expts.,
       followed by 1-mo depuration expts. in flow-through tanks. A
       toxicokinetic model was fitted to the uptake and depuration data,
       and the obtained parameters were used to simulate the significance
       of the two uptake pathways at different suspended sediment loads
       and sediment-seawater distribution coeffs. The results of the model
       simulations, assuming steady state conditions, suggest that
       resuspended particles from contaminated sediments can be a highly
       significant pathway for mussels in the order 109Cd ∼ 65Zn < 134Cs <
       60Co. The significance increases with higher suspended sediment
       load and with higher Kd. The exptl. depuration data suggest that Cs
       is retained longer and Co, Cd and Zn shorter by the mussels when
       assocd. with ingested sediments, than if the metals are taken up
       from the low mol. mass phase.

       As the application of nanomaterials to science and technol. grows,
       the need to understand any ecotoxicol. effects becomes increasingly
       important. Recent studies on a few species of fishes and
       invertebrates have provided data which suggest that harmful effects
       are possible. The way in which nanoparticles are taken up by
       aquatic organisms, however, has been little studied. We examd.
       uptake of nanoparticles by two species of suspension-feeding
       bivalves (mussels, Mytilus edulis; oysters, Crassostrea virginica),
       which capture individual particles <1 μm with a retention
       efficiency of <15%. Given this limitation, it would appear that
       nanoparticles could not be ingested in large nos. During certain
       times of the year, however, >70% of suspended particles are
       incorporated within aggregates that are >100 μm in size. Therefore,
       we delivered bivalves fluorescently labeled, 100-nm polystyrene
       beads that were either (1) dispersed or (2) embedded within
       aggregates generated in the lab. Results indicate that aggregates
       significantly enhance the uptake of 100-nm particles. Nanoparticles
       had a longer gut retention time than 10-μm polystyrene beads
       suggesting that nanoparticles were transported to the digestive
       gland. Our data suggest a mechanism for significant nanoparticle
       ingestion, and have implications for toxicol. effects and transfer
       of nanomaterials to higher trophic levels.

       with microplastics is their bioavailability to marine organisms. Up
       to date, ingestion has been widely accepted as the sole way for the
       animals to uptake microplastics. Nevertheless, microplastics have
       also been found in some organs which are not involved in the
       process of ingestion. The authors hypothesize that the animal might
       uptake microplastics through adherence in addn. to ingestion. To
       test this hypothesis, the authors collected mussels from the
       fishery farms, conducted exposure/clearance expts. and analyzed the
       accumulation of microplastics in specific organ of mussels. The
       authors' studies clearly showed the uptake of microplastic in
       multiple organs of mussels. In the field investigations, the
       authors found that the abundance of microplastic by wt. but not by
       individual showed significant difference among organs, and the
       intestine contained the highest level of microplastics (9.2
       items/g). In the uptake and clearance expt., the accumulation and
       retention of microfibers could also be obsd. in all tested organs
       of mussels including foot and mantle. The authors' results strongly
       suggest that adherence rather than ingestion led to the
       accumulation of microplastics in those organs which are not
       involved in ingestion process. To the authors' best knowledge, it
       is the first time to propose that adherence is a novel way for
       animals to uptake microplastics beyond ingestion. This new finding
       makes the authors rethink about the bioavailability, accumulation
       and toxicity of microplastics to aquatic animals.

       Suspension-feeding bivalves can influence the energy value of their
       food supply by particle selection at various stages from particle
       clearance to production of feces. Previous workers have found that
       some bivalve species (Mercenaria mercenaria, Mytilus edulis) are
       capable of postingestive selection within the stomach. Few studies,
       however, have attempted to isolate the factors that influence
       postingestive selection. In this study, we examined the ability of
       the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus to select particles within
       the stomach on the basis of physical properties. Scallops were
       presented with a mixture of three sizes of beads (5, 10 and 20 μm)
       or with a mixture of beads of different densities (1.05 g ml(-1)
       and 2.5 g ml(-1)). We demonstrate that P. magellanicus can
       distinguish between particles of different sizes and densities,
       retaining larger particles (20 μm) longer than smaller ones (5 μm)
       and lighter particles longer than denser ones. This ability to
       reject small, dense particles may benefit the scallop by reducing
       the amount of energy expended attempting to digest poor quality
       particles such as silt. This paper presents the first quantitative
       analysis of the effect of particle size and density on particle
       processing within intact bivalves.

       Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed simultaneously to
       a homologous series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates
       in a flow-through system to det. compd.-specific tissue
       distribution and bioconcn. parameters for perfluorinated acids
       (PFAs). In general, PFAs accumulated to the greatest extent in
       blood > kidney > liver > gall bladder. Carboxylates and sulfonates
       with perfluoroalkyl chain lengths shorter than seven and six
       carbons, resp., could not be detected in most tissues and were
       considered to have insignificant bioconcn. factors (BCFs). For
       detectable PFAs, carcass BCFs increased with increasing length of
       the perfluoroalkyl chain, ranging from 4.0 to 23,000, based on wet
       wt. concns. Carboxylate carcass BCFs increased by a factor of eight
       for each addnl. carbon in the perfluoroalkyl chain between 8 and 12
       carbons, but this relationship deviated from linearity for the
       longest PFA tested, possibly because of decreased gill
       permeability. In general, half-lives (3.9-28 d) and uptake rates
       (0.053-1,700 L/kg/d) also increased with increasing length of the
       perfluoroalkyl chain in all tissues. Sulfonates had greater BCFs,
       half-lives, and rates of uptake than the corresponding carboxylate
       of equal perfluoroalkyl chain length, indicating that
       hydrophobicity, as predicted by the crit. micelle concn., is not
       the only determinant of PFA bioaccumulation potential and that the
       acid function must be considered.

       Plastic debris is a prolific contaminant effecting freshwater and
       marine ecosystems across the globe. Of growing environmental
       concern are microplastics and nanoplastics encompassing tiny
       particles of plastic derived from manufg. and macroplastic
       fragmentation. Pelagic zooplankton are susceptible to consuming
       microplastics, however the threat posed to larvae of com. important
       bivalves is currently unknown. We exposed Pacific oyster
       (Crassostrea gigas) larvae (3-24 d.p.f.) to polystyrene particles
       of 70 nm-20 μm in size, including plastics with differing surface
       properties, and tested the impact of microplastics on larval
       feeding and growth. The frequency and magnitude of plastic
       ingestion over 24 h varied by larval age and size of polystyrene
       particle (ANOVA, p <0.01), and surface properties of the plastic,
       with aminated particles ingested and retained more frequently
       (ANOVA, p <0.01). A strong, significant correlation between
       propensity for plastic consumption and plastic load per organism
       was identified (Spearmans, r =0.95, p <0.01). Exposure to 1 and 10
       μm PS for ≤8 days had no significant effect on C. gigas feeding or
       growth at <100 microplastics/mL. In conclusion, while micro- and
       nanoplastics were readily ingested by oyster larvae, exposure to
       plastic concns. exceeding those obsd. in the marine environment
       resulted in no measurable effects on the development or feeding
       capacity of the larvae over the duration of the study.

       Polystyrene is abundant in marine debris. Like most synthetic
       polymers, it degrades very slowly, producing smaller and smaller
       particles easily ingested by wildlife. The presence of plastic
       microscopic particles in fish and marine wildlife is massive and
       well documented, but its impact on cellular activity is not
       understood. Biol. activity generally requires interaction with
       biol. membranes, but this is difficult to study at the mol. scale
       in vivo. Here we use coarse-grained mol. simulations to det. the
       effect of nanosized polystyrene (PS) particles on the properties of
       model biol. membranes. We find that PS nanoparticles permeate
       easily into lipid membranes. Dissolved in the membrane core, PS
       chains alter membrane structure, significantly reduce mol.
       diffusion, and soften the membrane. Moreover, PS severely affects
       membrane lateral organization by stabilizing raft-like domains.
       Changes in membrane properties and lateral organization can
       severely affect the activity of membrane proteins and thereby
       cellular function.

       Cell structure and function (1995), 20 (5), 355-67 ISSN:0386-7196.
       In the present work the haemocytes of mussels Mytilus
       galloprovincialis (Mollusca, Bivalvia) have been studied by light
       and electron microscopy in order to describe their main
       morphological features and to relate these to their roles in immune
       defence. The haemocytes belong to two definitive differentiated
       types, hyalinocytes and granulocytes. The former shows the presence
       of several fine pseudopodial protrusions, large nucleus with clumps
       of dense chromatin, scant cytoplasm, a well developed Golgi
       apparatus, lysosomes, several mitochondria (some with
       characteristic inclusions), coated pits and peripherally placed
       membrane-bound endocytic vesicles, considerable amounts of
       endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. The granulocytes generally
       possess an organelle-free ectoplasmic zone, numerous
       membrane-delimited dense granules of various types, coated pits and
       vesicles, endocytic and phagocytic vesicles, multivesicular bodies,
       several peroxisome-like organelles, mitochondria with inclusions,
       scant endoplasmic reticulum and small Golgi apparatus. These cells
       show the presence of few lipid droplets and variable amounts of
       glycogen particles. Some of the substructural features of the
       granules are documented here to indicate their probable biogenesis,
       growth and relationship with the endolysosomal compartment. In
       addition, in vitro phagocytosis experiments demonstrate that both
       hyalinocytes and granulocytes uptake latex and zymosan particles,
       granulocytes being much more active in phagocytosis than
       hyalinocytes.

            Microscopic plastic fragments and fibers are widespread in the
            world ocean, accumulating in the pelagic zone and sedimentary
            habitats. Fragments appear to have resulted from degrdn. of
            larger items. Plastics of this size are ingested by marine
            organisms, but environmental consequences of this
            contamination are unknown. Due to its resistance to biodegrdn.
            but susceptibility to mech. action, there is considerable
            potential for large-scale accumulation of microscopic plastic
            debris. To quantify the abundance of micro-plastics, sediment
            was collected from beaches and estuarine and sub-tidal
            sediment near Plymouth, UK. Nine polymers were conclusively
            identified: acrylic, alkyd, poly(ethylene:propylene),
            polyamide (nylon), polyester, polyethylene,
            polymethylacrylate, polypropylene, and poly vinyl alc. Given
            their wide range of uses, it is suggested the fragments
            resulted from larger item breakdown. To further assess the
            extent of contamination, another 17 beaches were examd.
            Similar fibers were obsd., demonstrating that microscopic
            plastics are common in sedimentary habitats. To assess
            long-term trends of abundance, plankton samples collected
            regularly since the 1960s between Aberdeen and the Shetland
            Islands and from Sule Skerry to Iceland, were analyzed.
            Plastic was archived among plankton in samples back to the
            1960s, but with a significant increase in abundance over time.
            Similar types of polymer in the water column and sediment
            suggested polymer d. was not a major factor affecting
            distribution. Some fragments were granular, but most were
            fibrous, ∼20 μm in diam., and brightly colored. Results
            demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this
            type of contamination. Given the rapid increase in plastic
            prodn., its longevity and disposable nature, this
            contamination is likely to increase.

            The release of plastics into the environment has been
            identified as an important issue for some time. Recent
            publications have suggested that the degrdn. of plastic
            materials will result in the release of nano-sized plastic
            particles to the environment. Nanoparticle tracking anal. was
            applied to characterize the formation of nanoplastics during
            the degrdn. of a polystyrene (PS) disposable coffee cup lid.
            The results clearly show an increase in the formation of
            nanoplastics over time. After 56 days' exposure the concn. of
            nanoplastics in the PS sample was 1.26 × 108 particles/mL (av.
            particles size 224 nm) compared to 0.41 × 108 particles/mL in
            the control.

            In this work, we present for the first time undeniable
            evidence of nano-plastic occurrence due to solar light degrdn.
            of marine micro-plastics under controlled and environmentally
            representative conditions. As obsd. during our recent
            expedition (Expedition 7th Continent), plastic pollution will
            be one of the most challenging ecol. threats for the next
            generation. Up to now, all studies have focused on the
            environmental and the economic impact of millimeter scale
            plastics. These plastics can be visualized, collected and
            studied. We are not aware of any studies reporting the
            possibilities of nano-plastics in marine water. Here, we
            developed for the first time a new solar reactor equipped with
            a nanoparticle detector to investigate the possibility of the
            formation of nano-plastics from millimeter scale plastics.
            With this system, correlated with electronic microscopy
            observations, we identified for the first time the presence of
            plastics at the nanoscale in water due to UV degrdn. Based on
            our observations, large fractal nano-plastic particles (i.e.,
            >100 nm) are produced by UV light after the initial formation
            of the smallest nano-plastic particles (i.e., <100 nm). These
            new results show the potential hazards of plastic waste at the
            nanoscale, which had not been taken into account previously.

            To document the marketing and distribution of nano-enabled
            products into the com. marketplace, the Woodrow Wilson
            International Center for Scholars and the Project on Emerging
            Nanotechnologies created the Nanotechnol. Consumer Products
            Inventory (CPI) in 2005. The objective of this present work is
            to redevelop the CPI by leading a research effort to increase
            the usefulness and reliability of this inventory. We created
            eight new descriptors for consumer products, including
            information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in each
            product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a
            diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and
            state/federal government had become highly dependent on the
            inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the
            pervasiveness of nanotechnol. in society. We interviewed 68
            nanotechnol. experts to assess key information needs. Their
            answers guided inventory modifications by providing a clear
            conceptual framework best suited for user expectations. The
            revised inventory was released in Oct. 2013. It currently
            lists 1814 consumer products from 622 companies in 32
            countries. The Health and Fitness category contains the most
            products (762, or 42% of the total). Silver is the most
            frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or 24%); however,
            49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not provide
            the compn. of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of the
            CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a
            variety of liq. media and dermal contact is the most likely
            exposure scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products,
            or 71%) of the products do not present enough supporting
            information to corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are
            used. The modified CPI has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities,
            which allow users to suggest edits to any entry and permits
            researchers to upload new findings ranging from human and
            environmental exposure data to complete life cycle
            assessments. There are inherent limitations to this type of
            database, but these modifications to the inventory addressed
            the majority of criticisms raised in published literature and
            in surveys of nanotechnol. stakeholders and experts. The
            development of standardized methods and metrics for
            nanomaterial characterization and labeling in consumer
            products can lead to greater understanding between the key
            stakeholders in nanotechnol., esp. consumers, researchers,
            regulators, and industry.

            Fragmentation of plastic debris and the com. use of plastic
            microbeads have led to the widespread distribution of
            microplastics in natural environments. Several studies have
            reported on the occurrence and toxicity of microplastics in
            soils and waters; however, because of methodol. challenges,
            the presence and impact of nanoplastics (<100 nm) in natural
            systems have been largely ignored. Microbeads used in consumer
            products such as scrubs and shampoos are processed by mech.
            means that may lead to their fragmentation into potentially
            more hazardous nanoplastics. In this study, three com. facial
            scrubs contg. polyethylene microbeads (∼0.2 mm diam.) were
            examd. to verify whether they contained nanoplastics.
            Particulates in the scrubs were fractionated using sequential
            filtration to isolate <100 nm particles. SEM was used to
            confirm the presence of nanoparticles ranging in size from 24
            ± 6 to 52 ± 14 nm. XPS and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy
            were used to confirm that the identified nanoparticles
            consisted of polyethylene. This study confirms the
            (unexpected) presence of nanoplastics in personal care
            products contg. polyethylene microbeads and highlights the
            need for further studies to characterize the release and
            distribution of nanoplastic litter in natural aquatic and soil
            environments.

            Small plastic detritus, termed microplastics, are a widespread
            and ubiquitous contaminant of marine ecosystems across the
            globe. Ingestion of microplastics by marine biota, including
            mussels, worms, fish, and seabirds, has been widely reported,
            but despite their vital ecol. role in marine food-webs, the
            impact of microplastics on zooplankton remains
            under-researched. We show that microplastics are ingested by,
            and may impact upon, zooplankton. We used bioimaging
            techniques to document ingestion, egestion, and adherence of
            microplastics in a range of zooplankton common to the
            northeast Atlantic, and used feeding rate studies to det. the
            impact of plastic detritus on algal ingestion rates in
            copepods. Using fluorescence and coherent anti-Stokes Raman
            scattering (CARS) microscopy we identified that 13 zooplankton
            taxa had the capacity to ingest 1.7-30.6 μm polystyrene beads,
            with uptake varying by taxa, life-stage and bead-size.
            Post-ingestion, copepods egested fecal pellets laden with
            microplastics. We further obsd. microplastics adhered to the
            external carapace and appendages of exposed zooplankton.
            Exposure of the copepod Centropages typicus to natural
            assemblages of algae with and without microplastics showed
            that 7.3 μm microplastics (>4000/mL) significantly decreased
            algal feeding. Our findings imply that marine microplastic
            debris can neg. impact upon zooplankton function and health.

            We assayed the toxicity of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP,
            52 nm) to Daphnia galeata. Survival and reproduction were
            significantly decreased in individuals exposed to 5 mg/L of
            PS-NP for 5 days, and embryos showed abnormal development,
            including a low hatching rate. Using fluorescence confocal
            microscopy, we recorded the transfer of PS-NP from the
            external surface of the body to the internal organs, including
            the thoracic appendices, ovaries, caudal appendices, and brood
            chamber, as well as PS-NP storage in lipid droplets. Although
            embryos were exposed to PS-NP in the brood chamber, they did
            not internalize PS-NP. Exposed D. galeata adults that were not
            pregnant stored significantly fewer lipid droplets than did
            the control group, and the lipid droplets that they did store
            were smaller; meanwhile, there were no significant changes in
            lipid storage in exposed pregnant individuals. Some embryos
            showed a high level of lipid storage, a response that occurs
            when embryos experience an abnormal state, and these embryos
            showed a very low hatching rate. However, the offspring of
            exposed adults showed normal survival and lipid storage. This
            study provides visual evidence that confirms the transfer and
            effects of PS-NP in Daphnia species, and suggests a
            relationship between toxicity and lipid storage.

            Contamination of fine plastic particles (FPs), including
            micrometer to millimeter plastics (MPs) and nanometer plastics
            (NPs), in the environment has caught great concerns. FPs are
            strong adsorbents for hydrophobic toxic pollutants and may
            affect their fate and toxicity in the environment; however,
            such information is still rare. We studied joint toxicity of
            FPs with phenanthrene to Daphnia magna and effects of FPs on
            the environmental fate and bioaccumulation of 14C-phenanthrene
            in fresh water. Within the five sizes particles we tested
            (from 50 nm to 10 μm), 50-nm NPs showed significant toxicity
            and phys. damage to D. magna. The joint toxicity of 50-nm NPs
            and phenanthrene to D. magna showed an additive effect. During
            a 14-days incubation, the presence of NPs significantly
            enhanced bioaccumulation of phenanthrene-derived residues in
            daphnid body and inhibited the dissipation and transformation
            of phenanthrene in the medium, while 10-μm MPs did not show
            significant effects on the bioaccumulation, dissipation, and
            transformation of phenanthrene. The differences may be
            attributed to higher adsorption of phenanthrene on 50-nm NPs
            than 10-μm MPs. Our findings underlined the high potential
            ecol. risks of FPs, and suggested that NPs should be given
            more concerns, in terms of their interaction with hydrophobic
            pollutants in the environment.

            The fast expansion of the global nanotechnol. market entails a
            higher environmental and human exposure to nanomaterials. Ag
            nanoparticles (AgNP) are used for their antibacterial
            properties; however, their environmental fate is yet poorly
            understood. Iceland scallops (Chlamys islandica) were exposed
            for 12 h to 3 different Ag forms, dissolved Ag(I) (Agdiss),
            small (S-NP, Φ = 10-20 nm) and large AgNP (L-NP, Φ = 70-80
            nm), labeled with 110mAg, and bioaccumulation kinetics and
            tissue distribution using in vivo γ counting and whole-body
            autoradiog. were detd. All Ag forms were readily and rapidly
            accumulated. Elimination process was also fast and
            bi-exponential, with mean biol. half-life ranging from 1.4 to
            4.3 days and from 17 to 50 days for fast and slow
            compartments, resp. Most of the radioactivity concd. in the
            hepatopancreas. Agdiss and S-NP tissue distributions were
            similar indicating a rapid dissoln. of the latter in the
            tissues, contrarily to L-NP which appeared to form long
            lasting aggregates in the digestive system. Estd. steady-state
            bioconcn. factors (BCF), ranging between 2700 and 3800 mL g-1
            for dissolved and particulate silver forms, showed that C.
            islandica can accumulate significant quantities of Ag in a
            short time followed by an efficient depuration process.

            Silver nanoparticles (AgNp) were synthesized using aq. soln.
            of silver nitrate ([110mAg]NO3) with poly(allylamine) as a
            reducing agent and a stabilizer of the AgNp suspension.
            Nanoparticles were characterized by absorption spectroscopy,
            particle size anal., at. force microscopy (AFM), and
            transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. Different size
            nanoparticles (10-30 nm and 70-90 nm) were obtained by varying
            the polymer concn. and reaction time. The application of
            [110mAg]AgNP to environmental studies, using nuclear
            techniques such as in vivo gamma counting and whole-body
            autoradiog., is demonstrated and discussed.

            Ag nanoparticles (AgNP) are ever-more being used in industrial
            processes and consumer products, resulting in increasing
            emissions to the environment. To understand AgNP behavior and
            environmental fate, it is paramount they can be traced in
            complex natural samples from exposure at high sensitivity.
            Stable isotope labeling is ideally suited for this purpose. To
            support such applications, a detailed evaluation of techniques
            to prep. stable isotope-labeled AgNP and demonstration that
            isotopically-modified particles are only distinguishable from
            particles with a natural isotope compn. by their strong
            isotopic signature, is presented. Monodisperse suspensions of
            citrate-stabilized AgNP of target sizes of 17, 20, and 30 nm
            were synthesized by reducing AgNO3 solns. with NaBH4. AgNP
            suspensions were produced using natural Ag, comprised of 2
            stable isotopes (107Ag [52%] and 109Ag [48%]), and Ag enriched
            to 99.2% in 107Ag. Synthesis was reliably reproduced on 3 sep.
            occasions in 2 labs. AgNP were characterized by dynamic light
            scattering shortly after synthesis and after up to 12 mo
            storage. Some batches were also characterized by transmission
            electron microscopy and asym. flow field-flow fractionation.
            Particle size distributions showed good reproducibility
            between labs. and stability over 12 mo storage. 107Ag-enriched
            particles were indistinguishable in size and shape from
            particles with natural isotope compn. Reliability, particle
            size control, and high yield (∼80%) demonstrated the synthesis
            technique is well suited for small-scale prodn. of
            isotopically-labeled AgNP. Isotope mass balance calcns. showed
            the use of labeling enables AgNP tracing sensitivities which
            are at least 40 times, and possibly up to 4000 times, higher
            than those achievable with bulk Ag concn. measurements, and
            expts. with exposure concns. approaching predicted
            environmental levels are possible, if the most precise
            isotopic measurement techniques are used.

            Plastics debris is accumulating in the environment and is
            fragmenting into smaller pieces; as it does, the potential for
            ingestion by animals increases. The consequences of
            macroplastic debris for wildlife are well documented, however
            the impacts of microplastic (<1 mm) are poorly understood. The
            mussel, Mytilus edulis, was used to investigate ingestion,
            translocation, and accumulation of this debris. Initial expts.
            showed that upon ingestion, microplastic accumulated in the
            gut. Mussels were subsequently exposed to treatments contg.
            seawater and microplastic (3.0 or 9.6 μm). After transfer to
            clean conditions, microplastic was tracked in the hemolymph.
            Particles translocated from the gut to the circulatory system
            within 3 days and persisted for over 48 days. Abundance of
            microplastic was greatest after 12 days and declined
            thereafter. Smaller particles were more abundant than larger
            particles and our data indicate as plastic fragments into
            smaller particles, the potential for accumulation in the
            tissues of an organism increases. The short-term pulse
            exposure used here did not result in significant biol.
            effects. However, plastics are exceedingly durable and so
            further work using a wider range of organisms, polymers, and
            periods of exposure will be required to establish the biol.
            consequences of this debris.

            BACKGROUND: Carbon nanotubes represent a class of
            nanomaterials having broad application potentials and
            documented cellular uptake and ecotoxicol. effects that raise
            the possibility that they may bioaccumulate in living
            organisms. OBJECTIVES: Radioactively labeled nanotubes were
            synthesized using a novel methane chem. vapor deposition
            procedure. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), multiwalled
            carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and pyrene were spiked to sediment
            samples, and the resp. uptake and depuration of these
            nanotubes and pyrene were assessed by the oligochaete,
            Lumbriculus variegatus. RESULTS: 14C-labeled carbon nanotubes
            were developed for these expts. to overcome significant
            previous limitations for quantifying nanotube materials in
            environmental and biol. media. Biota-sediment accumulation
            factors for SWNTs and MWNTs were obsd. to be almost an order
            of magnitude lower than those for pyrene, a four-ringed
            polycyclic arom. hydrocarbon (PAH). The depuration behaviors
            of the oligochaete suggested that the nanotubes detected in
            these organisms were assocd. with sediments remaining in the
            organism guts and not absorbed into cellular tissues as was
            the pyrene. The results suggest that, unlike PAHs, purified
            carbon nanotubes do not readily absorb into organism tissues.

            A new method allowing the 14C-labeling of carboxylic acid
            functions of carbon nanotubes is described. The key step of
            the labeling process is a decarbonylation reaction that has
            been developed and optimized with the help of a screening
            method. The optimized process has been successfully applied to
            multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and the corresponding
            14C-labeled nanotubes were used to investigate their in vivo
            behavior. Preliminary results obtained after i.v.
            contamination of rats revealed liver as the main target organ.
            Radiolabeling of NTs with a long-life radioactive nucleus like
            14C, coupled to a highly sensitive autoradiog. method, that
            provides a unique detection threshold, will make it possible
            to det. for a long time period whether or not NTs remain in
            any organs after animal exposure.

            Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and
            its potential impacts to wildlife and humans present a growing
            global concern. Despite recent efforts in understanding
            environmental impacts assocd. with plastic pollution,
            considerable uncertainties still exist regarding the true
            risks of nano- and micro-sized plastics (<5 mm). The
            challenges faced in this field largely relate to the methodol.
            and anal. limitations assocd. with studying plastic debris at
            low (environmentally relevant) concns. The present paper
            highlights how radiotracing techniques that are commonly
            applied to trace the fate and behavior of chems. and particles
            in various systems, can contribute towards addressing several
            important and outstanding questions in environmental plastic
            pollution research. Specifically, we discuss the use of
            radiolabeled microplastics and/or chems. for 1) detg.
            sorption/desorption kinetics of a range of contaminants to
            different types of plastics under varying conditions, 2)
            understanding the influence of microplastics on contaminant
            and nutrient bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, and 3)
            assessing biokinetics, biodistribution, trophic transfer and
            potential biol. impacts of microplastic at realistic concns.
            Radiotracer techniques are uniquely suited for this research
            because of their sensitivity, accuracy and capacity to measure
            relevant parameters over time. Obtaining precise and timely
            information on the fate of plastic particles and
            co-contaminants in wildlife has widespread applications
            towards effective monitoring programs and environmental
            management strategies.

            Two kinds of styrene microemulsion systems were polymd. to
            prep. polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS), one emulsified by
            Na dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and coemulsified by 1-pentanol and
            the other emulsified by octylphenoxypoly(ethoxyethanol)
            (OP-10). Micro-PS possessed an essentially atactic
            configuration based on 1H-NMR measurement. Comparison of IR
            spectra showed some conformational differences between
            micro-PS and ordinary atactic PS (o-PS). Each polystyrene
            microsphere contains only about 3 macromol. chains (so-called
            pauci-chain microspheres), which adopt a special conformation:
            individual chains are highly compact, while the whole
            structure of the microsphere is relatively loose in comparison
            with a random-coil chain in a multichain system. There were
            apparent differences in thermal behaviors between micro-PS and
            o-PS during the DSC scan. Micro-PS displayed 2 exotherms near
            107 and 157° during the first scan. In the subsequent scan,
            both exotherms disappeared and only one glass transition
            similar to o-PS was found. The first exotherm might be due to
            the sintering of polystyrene microspheres with small particle
            sizes. From wide-angle X-ray diffraction and polarizing
            optical microscopy studies, the second exotherm could be
            ascribed to the relatively compact conformation of polystyrene
            chains and the consequently formed slightly ordered regions
            inside micro-PS during the heating process. The special
            conformation was the driving force leading to its novel
            thermal behaviors. This is perhaps the first report that
            polystyrene from direct radical polymn. has the ability to
            form some kind of ordered structure.

            Sediments can act as a sink for contaminants in effluents from
            industrial and nuclear installations or when released from
            dumped waste. However, contaminated sediments may also act as
            a potential source of radionuclides and trace metals to the
            water phase due to remobilization of metals as dissolved
            species and resuspension of particles. The marine mussel
            Mytilus edulis is a filter-feeding organism that via the gills
            is subjected to contaminants in dissolved form and from
            contaminants assocd. to suspended particles via the digestive
            system. The bioavailability of sediment-assocd. and seawater
            dild. Cs, Co, Cd and Zn radioactive tracers to the filtering
            bivalve M. edulis was examd. The mussels were exposed to
            tracers dild. in ultrafiltered (<10 KDa) seawater (low mol.
            mass form) or to tracers assocd. with sediment particles from
            the Stepovogo Fjord at Novaya Zemlya in short-term uptake
            expts., followed by 1-mo depuration expts. in flow-through
            tanks. A toxicokinetic model was fitted to the uptake and
            depuration data, and the obtained parameters were used to
            simulate the significance of the two uptake pathways at
            different suspended sediment loads and sediment-seawater
            distribution coeffs. The results of the model simulations,
            assuming steady state conditions, suggest that resuspended
            particles from contaminated sediments can be a highly
            significant pathway for mussels in the order 109Cd ∼ 65Zn <
            134Cs < 60Co. The significance increases with higher suspended
            sediment load and with higher Kd. The exptl. depuration data
            suggest that Cs is retained longer and Co, Cd and Zn shorter
            by the mussels when assocd. with ingested sediments, than if
            the metals are taken up from the low mol. mass phase.

            As the application of nanomaterials to science and technol.
            grows, the need to understand any ecotoxicol. effects becomes
            increasingly important. Recent studies on a few species of
            fishes and invertebrates have provided data which suggest that
            harmful effects are possible. The way in which nanoparticles
            are taken up by aquatic organisms, however, has been little
            studied. We examd. uptake of nanoparticles by two species of
            suspension-feeding bivalves (mussels, Mytilus edulis; oysters,
            Crassostrea virginica), which capture individual particles <1
            μm with a retention efficiency of <15%. Given this limitation,
            it would appear that nanoparticles could not be ingested in
            large nos. During certain times of the year, however, >70% of
            suspended particles are incorporated within aggregates that
            are >100 μm in size. Therefore, we delivered bivalves
            fluorescently labeled, 100-nm polystyrene beads that were
            either (1) dispersed or (2) embedded within aggregates
            generated in the lab. Results indicate that aggregates
            significantly enhance the uptake of 100-nm particles.
            Nanoparticles had a longer gut retention time than 10-μm
            polystyrene beads suggesting that nanoparticles were
            transported to the digestive gland. Our data suggest a
            mechanism for significant nanoparticle ingestion, and have
            implications for toxicol. effects and transfer of
            nanomaterials to higher trophic levels.

            Microplastic pollution is recognized as an emerging threat to
            aquatic ecosystems. One of the main environmental risks
            assocd. with microplastics is their bioavailability to marine
            organisms. Up to date, ingestion has been widely accepted as
            the sole way for the animals to uptake microplastics.
            Nevertheless, microplastics have also been found in some
            organs which are not involved in the process of ingestion. The
            authors hypothesize that the animal might uptake microplastics
            through adherence in addn. to ingestion. To test this
            hypothesis, the authors collected mussels from the fishery
            farms, conducted exposure/clearance expts. and analyzed the
            accumulation of microplastics in specific organ of mussels.
            The authors' studies clearly showed the uptake of microplastic
            in multiple organs of mussels. In the field investigations,
            the authors found that the abundance of microplastic by wt.
            but not by individual showed significant difference among
            organs, and the intestine contained the highest level of
            microplastics (9.2 items/g). In the uptake and clearance
            expt., the accumulation and retention of microfibers could
            also be obsd. in all tested organs of mussels including foot
            and mantle. The authors' results strongly suggest that
            adherence rather than ingestion led to the accumulation of
            microplastics in those organs which are not involved in
            ingestion process. To the authors' best knowledge, it is the
            first time to propose that adherence is a novel way for
            animals to uptake microplastics beyond ingestion. This new
            finding makes the authors rethink about the bioavailability,
            accumulation and toxicity of microplastics to aquatic animals.

            Suspension-feeding bivalves can influence the energy value of
            their food supply by particle selection at various stages from
            particle clearance to production of feces. Previous workers
            have found that some bivalve species (Mercenaria mercenaria,
            Mytilus edulis) are capable of postingestive selection within
            the stomach. Few studies, however, have attempted to isolate
            the factors that influence postingestive selection. In this
            study, we examined the ability of the sea scallop Placopecten
            magellanicus to select particles within the stomach on the
            basis of physical properties. Scallops were presented with a
            mixture of three sizes of beads (5, 10 and 20 μm) or with a
            mixture of beads of different densities (1.05 g ml(-1) and 2.5
            g ml(-1)). We demonstrate that P. magellanicus can distinguish
            between particles of different sizes and densities, retaining
            larger particles (20 μm) longer than smaller ones (5 μm) and
            lighter particles longer than denser ones. This ability to
            reject small, dense particles may benefit the scallop by
            reducing the amount of energy expended attempting to digest
            poor quality particles such as silt. This paper presents the
            first quantitative analysis of the effect of particle size and
            density on particle processing within intact bivalves.

            Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed
            simultaneously to a homologous series of perfluoroalkyl
            carboxylates and sulfonates in a flow-through system to det.
            compd.-specific tissue distribution and bioconcn. parameters
            for perfluorinated acids (PFAs). In general, PFAs accumulated
            to the greatest extent in blood > kidney > liver > gall
            bladder. Carboxylates and sulfonates with perfluoroalkyl chain
            lengths shorter than seven and six carbons, resp., could not
            be detected in most tissues and were considered to have
            insignificant bioconcn. factors (BCFs). For detectable PFAs,
            carcass BCFs increased with increasing length of the
            perfluoroalkyl chain, ranging from 4.0 to 23,000, based on wet
            wt. concns. Carboxylate carcass BCFs increased by a factor of
            eight for each addnl. carbon in the perfluoroalkyl chain
            between 8 and 12 carbons, but this relationship deviated from
            linearity for the longest PFA tested, possibly because of
            decreased gill permeability. In general, half-lives (3.9-28 d)
            and uptake rates (0.053-1,700 L/kg/d) also increased with
            increasing length of the perfluoroalkyl chain in all tissues.
            Sulfonates had greater BCFs, half-lives, and rates of uptake
            than the corresponding carboxylate of equal perfluoroalkyl
            chain length, indicating that hydrophobicity, as predicted by
            the crit. micelle concn., is not the only determinant of PFA
            bioaccumulation potential and that the acid function must be
            considered.

            Plastic debris is a prolific contaminant effecting freshwater
            and marine ecosystems across the globe. Of growing
            environmental concern are microplastics and nanoplastics
            encompassing tiny particles of plastic derived from manufg.
            and macroplastic fragmentation. Pelagic zooplankton are
            susceptible to consuming microplastics, however the threat
            posed to larvae of com. important bivalves is currently
            unknown. We exposed Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae
            (3-24 d.p.f.) to polystyrene particles of 70 nm-20 μm in size,
            including plastics with differing surface properties, and
            tested the impact of microplastics on larval feeding and
            growth. The frequency and magnitude of plastic ingestion over
            24 h varied by larval age and size of polystyrene particle
            (ANOVA, p <0.01), and surface properties of the plastic, with
            aminated particles ingested and retained more frequently
            (ANOVA, p <0.01). A strong, significant correlation between
            propensity for plastic consumption and plastic load per
            organism was identified (Spearmans, r =0.95, p <0.01).
            Exposure to 1 and 10 μm PS for ≤8 days had no significant
            effect on C. gigas feeding or growth at <100 microplastics/mL.
            In conclusion, while micro- and nanoplastics were readily
            ingested by oyster larvae, exposure to plastic concns.
            exceeding those obsd. in the marine environment resulted in no
            measurable effects on the development or feeding capacity of
            the larvae over the duration of the study.

            Polystyrene is abundant in marine debris. Like most synthetic
            polymers, it degrades very slowly, producing smaller and
            smaller particles easily ingested by wildlife. The presence of
            plastic microscopic particles in fish and marine wildlife is
            massive and well documented, but its impact on cellular
            activity is not understood. Biol. activity generally requires
            interaction with biol. membranes, but this is difficult to
            study at the mol. scale in vivo. Here we use coarse-grained
            mol. simulations to det. the effect of nanosized polystyrene
            (PS) particles on the properties of model biol. membranes. We
            find that PS nanoparticles permeate easily into lipid
            membranes. Dissolved in the membrane core, PS chains alter
            membrane structure, significantly reduce mol. diffusion, and
            soften the membrane. Moreover, PS severely affects membrane
            lateral organization by stabilizing raft-like domains. Changes
            in membrane properties and lateral organization can severely
            affect the activity of membrane proteins and thereby cellular
            function.

            In the present work the haemocytes of mussels Mytilus
            galloprovincialis (Mollusca, Bivalvia) have been studied by
            light and electron microscopy in order to describe their main
            morphological features and to relate these to their roles in
            immune defence. The haemocytes belong to two definitive
            differentiated types, hyalinocytes and granulocytes. The
            former shows the presence of several fine pseudopodial
            protrusions, large nucleus with clumps of dense chromatin,
            scant cytoplasm, a well developed Golgi apparatus, lysosomes,
            several mitochondria (some with characteristic inclusions),
            coated pits and peripherally placed membrane-bound endocytic
            vesicles, considerable amounts of endoplasmic reticulum and
            ribosomes. The granulocytes generally possess an
            organelle-free ectoplasmic zone, numerous membrane-delimited
            dense granules of various types, coated pits and vesicles,
            endocytic and phagocytic vesicles, multivesicular bodies,
            several peroxisome-like organelles, mitochondria with
            inclusions, scant endoplasmic reticulum and small Golgi
            apparatus. These cells show the presence of few lipid droplets
            and variable amounts of glycogen particles. Some of the
            substructural features of the granules are documented here to
            indicate their probable biogenesis, growth and relationship
            with the endolysosomal compartment. In addition, in vitro
            phagocytosis experiments demonstrate that both hyalinocytes
            and granulocytes uptake latex and zymosan particles,
            granulocytes being much more active in phagocytosis than
            hyalinocytes.
