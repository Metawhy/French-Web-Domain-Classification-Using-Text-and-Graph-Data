   Subject: C5c) Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by nuking
   them ?

   Contributed by Stan Goldenberg and Hugh Willoughby

   During each hurricane season, there always appear suggestions that one
   should simply use nuclear weapons to try and destroy the storms. Apart
   from the fact that this might not even alter the storm, this approach
   neglects the problem that the released radioactive fallout would fairly
   quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas and cause
   devastating environmental problems. Needless to say, this is not a good
   idea.

   Now for a more rigorous scientific explanation of why this would not be
   an effective hurricane modification technique. The main difficulty with
   using explosives to modify hurricanes is the amount of energy required.
   A fully developed hurricane can release heat energy at a rate of 5 to
   20x10^13 watts and converts less than 10% of the heat into the
   mechanical energy of the wind. The heat release is equivalent to a
   10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. According to the
   1993 World Almanac, the entire human race used energy at a rate of
   10^13 watts in 1990, a rate less than 20% of the power of a hurricane.

   If we think about mechanical energy, the energy at humanity's disposal
   is closer to the storm's, but the task of focusing even half of the
   energy on a spot in the middle of a remote ocean would still be
   formidable. Brute force interference with hurricanes doesn't seem
   promising.

   In addition, an explosive, even a nuclear explosive, produces a shock
   wave, or pulse of high pressure, that propagates away from the site of
   the explosion somewhat faster than the speed of sound. Such an event
   doesn't raise the barometric pressure after the shock has passed
   because barometric pressure in the atmosphere reflects the weight of
   the air above the ground. For normal atmospheric pressure, there are
   about ten metric tons (1000 kilograms per ton) of air bearing down on
   each square meter of surface. In the strongest hurricanes there are
   nine. To change a Category 5 hurricane into a Category 2 hurricane you
   would have to add about a half ton of air for each square meter inside
   the eye, or a total of a bit more than half a billion (500,000,000)
   tons for a 20 km radius eye. It's difficult to envision a practical way
   of moving that much air around.

   Attacking weak tropical waves or depressions before they have a chance
   to grow into hurricanes isn't promising either. About 80 of these
   disturbances form every year in the Atlantic basin, but only about 5
   become hurricanes in a typical year. There is no way to tell in advance
   which ones will develop. If the energy released in a tropical
   disturbance were only 10% of that released in a hurricane, it's still a
   lot of power, so that the hurricane police would need to dim the whole
   world's lights many times a year.
