Introductions and the Evolution of the Martini

   April 30, 2017 richardmcgary 19 Comments

   A well lived life is full of stories. My father’s life was filled with
   great stories about family, friends, food, sports, law or any myriad of
   other topics. Whatever the story, it was often accompanied by a great
   glass of wine or a nice drink.

Introductions.

   DEM 1

   Hi, I’m Daniel, aka Knothead, the youngest son of Sweetieman and Baby
   lady.  To give a little background about myself, I’m the fourth of five
   children and the youngest son. I served in the United States Coast
   Guard as a Food Service Specialist Third Class; where I cooked and help
   manage the Sector Northern New England Galley and Mess. We’re already
   loosely acquainted through several of my father’s posts which include
   some of my work. Like my father, I love good food and I also happen to
   love a good drink. As such, this is the introductory post for the new
   cocktail section of this blog. Ironically this is not the first
   cocktail post here, that would be the recipe for Gin and Tonic which
   is under the post for homemade tonic water.

   DEM 2.png

   My father loved gin and used to drink martinis semi regularly, that is
   until his second year of law school. The way Dad told this story, he
   was living in Lubbock at the time and due to some miscommunication he
   thought his father had fallen seriously ill. He was out with friends
   and may have consumed one too many dry martinis. It was then that he
   swore off them for good…. That is until his youngest son came home and
   started drinking them. Curiosity would get the better of him; a week or
   so later I come home to find a martini glass with ice on the kitchen
   island and my father walking around with a bottle of Tanqueray in hand.
   Naturally, I start laughing, asking him what on earth is he doing? He
   looks at me befuddled and says don’t you pour the vermouth over the ice
   and pour it off? At which point I usher him to the side and make his
   drink. The recipe for this drink, I have loving dubbed the Richard
   McGary martini which is as follows.

   REM Martini.png

   Ingredients – The Richard McGary Martini
     * .5 ounces Vya Dry (or other good dry vermouth such as Dolin Dry)
     * 2 ounces Tanqueray
     * Ice

   Place ice in a shaker and pour in vermouth. Coat the ice with the
   vermouth, and strain off excess. Pour Tanqueray into shaker. Shake
   briefly and strain into a martini glass. Garnish with cocktail onions,
   olives or both.

   Note: this is how my father preferred his martini. Shaking a cocktail
   over stirring, causes more of the ice to melt and increases dilution.
   This may work for you but it is not what I recommend.

   Now, the martini has origins in two older cocktails. Its grandfather
   being one almost entirely lost to time despite its former popularity,
   the Turf Club. The first written recipe for the Turf Club is from 1884
   and calls for Old Tom Gin and Italian Vermouth. During that time it was
   assumed that Italian vermouth was the sweet red kind rather than dry
   off-white, which was frequently referred to as French vermouth. The
   assumption was obviously wrong and they are now called by their proper
   names. However, the Turf Club has more variations than nearly any
   drink, with both the styles of gin and vermouth frequently changing. It
   is also common to add a splash of absinthe or maraschino liqueur to the
   drink. One recipe for a rather dry Turf Club is as follows:

   Ingredients – The Turf Club
     * 1.5 ounces Ransom London Dry Gin
     * 1.5 ounces Vya Dry Vermouth
     * 1 teaspoon Kirsch
     * 1 teaspoon Herbsaint (or other anise liqueur such as Penrod)
     * 3 dashes orange bitters
     * Ice

   Turf club Martini a copy

   Pour the vermouth, Herbsaint, and gin into a mixing glass. Add ice.
   Using a bar spoon stir for ten seconds. Double strain into a coup
   glass. Float the Kirsch by gently placing the contents on top of the
   drink surface. This provides better aromatics and additional complexity
   to the drink. Run an orange peel along the rim of the glass and use it
   as a garnish.

   Whereas the origins of the Turf Club are unknown, the origins of the
   next martini, the Martinez, are hotly debated. The Martinez is
   remarkably similar to both the Turf Club, and the oldest of vermouth
   cocktails, the Manhattan. The most frequently repeated origin story,
   was that it was birthed in Martinez, California for a miner wanting
   champagne. The bartender not having champagne, lied. Telling the miner
   that he had something better than champagne, the “Martinez Special”.
   Like most drinks of the time, the Martinez uses Old Tom gin rather than
   London Dry. Recipe is as follows.

   Ingredients – The Martinez
     * 2 ounces Ransom Old Tom Gin
     * 0.75 ounces Carpano Antica Vermouth
     * 0.25 ounces Vya Dry Vermouth
     * 0.25 ounces Grand Marnier
     * 2 dashes orange bitters

   Martinez Martini a copy

   Pour all ingredients into mixing glass. Add ice. Using a bar spoon stir
   for ten seconds. Double strain into a coup glass. Garnish with orange
   peel.

   Over time the Martinez morphed into the 1:1 Martini, substituting away
   from sweet vermouth to extra dry, and from Old Tom to London Dry.
   However, prior to prohibition vermouth was used in significantly higher
   quantities. Originally, the recipe for a 1:1 Martini would look more
   like this:

   Ingredients 1:1 Martini
     * 1.5 ounces Ransom London Dry Gin
     * 1.5 ounces Vya Dry Vermouth

   Martini a.png

   Pour all ingredients into a mixing glass. Add ice. Using a bar spoon
   stir for ten seconds. Double strain into a martini glass. Garnish with
   a lemon peel.

   Finally, during prohibition, less spirited drinks fell out of fashion
   due to the difficulty of procuring alcohol. Afterwards, Americans
   somehow had forgotten that vermouth, while fortified, is still a wine.
   Once opened, vermouth will eventually oxidize and is best consumed
   within 4-6 weeks. Bartenders forgot this and as a result martinis grew
   dryer and dryer until they resembled what my father was familiar with,
   where you poured the excess off. However, vermouth when treated with
   respect, adds a level of complexity on the nose and palate that is not
   to be underestimated. I therefore submit to you what I consider the
   “Ideal Martini” and would have been more along the lines of what people
   were drinking just before Prohibition:

   Ingredients – The Ideal Martini
     * 2 ounces St. George’s Terroir Gin
     * 0.25 ounces Vya Dry Vermouth
     * 2 dashes orange bitters.

   Ideal Martini a

   Pour all ingredients into a mixing glass. Add ice. Using a bar spoon
   stir for ten seconds. Double strain into a martini glass. Garnish with
   a lemon peel.

   So there you have it. You now have several recipes to try. Have a great
   martini and think of all the possibilities. As for me, here is to you
   Dad!

In loving memory of Richard Emory McGary (aka the Sweetieman)

   February 14, 2017 richardmcgary 26 Comments
   SONY DSC SONY DSC

   It is with great sorrow and a heavy heart that I must share the sad
   news of the passing of our wonderful Richard aka the Sweetieman.  I
   also feel the need to apologize for taking so long to write this post.
   It  took me some time to get his affairs in order and gather my
   thoughts around publishing this news. This picture was taken late one
   evening after dinner as we relaxed on the patio scrolling through the
   countless cooking and pouring shots. It was one of his favorite ways to
   wind down after dinner and reflect on the next post. Richard loved the
   blog and the people he met through it. He loved sharing stories and his
   love of good food. As this blog grew so did the friendships and the
   stories of new friends and new ideas. He is missed every minute of
   everyday by us and so we would like to share his obituary with you.

Obituary

   Richard Emory McGary, loving husband and devoted father, noted
   litigation and products liability attorney, chef and food blogger
   passed away Friday, October 9, 2015 at age 61 at his home in
   Richardson, Texas.

   250a

   Richard will always be remembered for his kindness and loving
   friendship to his friends and as the lawyer in the cowboy hat to his
   clients. He was always up beat and met each day with a smile on his
   face.  Clients, colleagues and peers described Richard as a “lawyer’s
   lawyer—-someone you could trust and know that he would always be
   prepared, fight the fair fight, and give it hell, all the time. His
   quality of work was the gold standard. He was a great example of what
   young lawyers should aspire to be.” Richard described himself as a
   lawyer by day and chef by night, as he loved the law and all things
   culinary. He spent over 25 years handling complex litigation and as
   National Counsel for several major manufacturers of consumer
   electronics products managing product liability litigation as well as
   advising them on issues of product liability, consumer product safety,
   and risk management issues directed towards reducing exposure to
   product liability, warranty and other product related claims. Richard
   also successfully presented his clients’ cases before the Texas Supreme
   Court on two occasions.

   Richard had boundless energy to juggle work, play, and family.  He had
   many passions, all of them pursued with unflagging enthusiasm, gusto,
   and joy. He was an avid fly fisherman and even tied his own flies. He
   was a knowledgeable wine connoisseur, with an extensive wine cellar to
   show for it. He loved art and collected it. He loved antiques but was
   most partial to family heirlooms.

   500a

   Richard was also a gourmet cook having cooked professionally and run
   restaurants in his early adult years prior to law school. He started as
   a fry cook, a line cook, a saucier, etc., then doing a stint in
   culinary school, running kitchens and managing restaurants. He then
   made his way to law school, passed the bar and began practicing law in
   1985. In recent years, he began blogging about food on his cooking
   blog, REMCooks. com. He and his blog were honored with various awards
   and acknowledgments from his fellow bloggers and was also featured by
   Richardson Living magazine in their May/June 2015
   edition. http://richardsonliving.com/features-taste-buds/love-culinary.
   In his blog, he explains how his blog evolved and took on a life of its
   own. It was a real joy that allowed him to meet many new people from
   all over the world who love food, cooking, good times and sharing
   knowledge as much as he did. He always felt fortunate, thankful and
   honored that people recognized his photos, recipes and work.

   REMCooks

   Richard was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Mary Joanne Miller
   McGary and Lester Eugene McGary Jr. MD. He attended Corsicana schools
   until 1967 when he then began attending St. Mark’s School of Texas, in
   Dallas. He would later return to Corsicana High School graduating in
   1972. While at Corsicana High School, Richard actively participated in
   choir, gymnastics, baseball and football.

   Richard continued on attended The University of Texas at Arlington
   receiving a BA in Political Science in 1982 and Texas Tech University
   School of Law where he graduated cum laude in 1984. He was on the Texas
   Tech Law Review and was admitted to the Texas bar on May 1985; United
   States District Court for the Northern, Southern and Eastern Districts
   in the State of Texas;  United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
   and admitted pro hac vice in Arizona, California, Colorado, Indiana,
   Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
   Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
   Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Utah.

   lm-wedding

   Richard is survived by his loving wife, Elia Hernandez McGary (aka the
   Baby Lady) of Richardson, TX and their five children; his father Lester
   Eugene McGary, MD. of Corsicana, TX; Lester Eugene McGary III, (and
   Donna Briggs McGary) of Charlotte, NC; and John Edward McGary (and
   Gladys Bel McGary) of Houston, TX. Richard was predeceased by his
   mother, Mary Joanne McGary.

   A memorial service was held on Monday, February 29, 2016 at Custer Road
   United Methodist Church in Plano, Texas. Eulogy by Teresa Burroff, John
   Anderson and Charlene Koonce. The family requested donations be made to
   the Heart Association in lieu of sending flowers.

What’s next?

   As we look forward, Daniel (Knothead), Robert (Quickstep) and I (Baby
   Lady) will be publishing four recipes that Richard left as drafts.
   Daniel is adding a new section for cocktails which he is excited about
   sharing. I will continue to share the recipes Richard and I cooked and
   those I think he would enjoy sharing. Robert will be serving as
   photographer. We hope to continue to share his passion for good food
   with you.

   Admit it. You want some.

   Now that we made the chorizo we had to something with it, right?
   Actually, the reason I made the chorizo was two-fold. First, I had made
   it previously and my sister-in-law Eva asked me for the recipe. Second,
   I wanted to make this dish and I sure am glad I did. 🙂

   Homemade Chorizo I love, love, love sausage. I mean, what self

   venison (one of my favorites), beef, pork, chicken, turkey, duck, etc.
   I have even had shrimp sausage. But today, by popular demand, we are
   talking about Chorizo. Chorizo is known for its rich red color and its
   smoky earthiness with a sweet with a gentle tang,
