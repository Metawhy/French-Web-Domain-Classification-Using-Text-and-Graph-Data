Test the Fruit

   I was lingering.  I knew it, but I just couldn't help it.  Passerby's
   came and went, I could hear the watch in my head ticking methodically,
   but none of that deterred me from my current task of picking up and
   turning round and round each plastic container of strawberries until I
   found the best one …

What does loving the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind and strength
look like?

   What does loving the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind and strength
   look like? I want to love the Lord with all my heart, soul, mind and
   strength. (Mark 20:30) But, what does that mean? That's a question I've
   been contemplating for some weeks. I feel like I'm chipping away at
   little bits of …

The book I couldn’t put down at Hobby Lobby

   I had a little time to kill while my daughter and her friend shopped.
   It's very rare for me to have time to kill.  This season of my life is
   filled with busy-ness.  I rarely go into a store and browse.  I run in
   with my list in hand, and run out with the items …

   tree of life." Proverbs 13:12 I used to think the "desire" was the

   things He wants.  To know Him more.  To serve Him well. And when that …

Elisabeth Elliot – Suffering is Never for Nothing

   This summer, one of the books I'm reading is Suffering is Never for
   Nothing, by Elizabeth Elliot.  Most all of us are familiar with the
   Elliot name.  Jim Elliot, along with four other missionaries, were
   speared to death while trying to evangelize the Waorani people in
   Ecuador. Jim's wife, Elizabeth, stayed on with their young …
