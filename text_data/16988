Finally an update!

   For weeks now I have been wanting to give you an update on the store.
   Thank you to everyone who has been following along on Facebook and
   Instagram - your enthusiasm has been so inspiring for us!
   It has been an amazing experience. When we came up with this crazy idea
   to buy a heritage building, move Cartolina into it, and open a retail
   store all at the same time - we had no idea how much work and how much
   fun we would have doing it. The support from locals and tourists has
   been overwhelming to say the least. Here are a few pictures - and I
   promise, now that we have the daily routine and the work schedule
   figured out, I'll add updates here on a regular basis.
   More soon!

Cartolina Retail - salvage day!

   Years ago I posted here about an abandoned store in Greenwood - a town
   near here. I have been coveting the vintage store counters in that shop
   for so long! I contacted the lovely owner and, over the course of a few
   weeks, managed to convince her to part with them. So, off we went to
   Greenwood yesterday afternoon to pick up them up. It was so exciting to
   load the front counter on to the trailer and bring it back to the
   building. It took some wrestling to push it, on the dolly, down the
   sidewalk to the store, but we eventually got it there It's about 10ft
   long and has lots of cubbies on the reverse side. It's, well . . . .
   perfect for the store!

Cartolina Retail - Demolition Day no.1 - a surprise!

   Update: So today was day no.1 at the new building. We bought the
   building 2 months ago and have been waiting patiently(not) for the
   tenants to move out.
   There is a lot of work to do before we can move in - but it's mostly
   what Doug refers to as a 'dumpster gut'. We have to remove 100 years of
   bad renovations and take it back to the original floors and brick
   walls.
   Yesterday Doug and the contractor went through the building to assess
   the situation. They peeked behind the dropped ceiling and low and
   behold - there's the original pressed tin ceiling. In all it's glory -
   stretching from the front of the building to the back, complete with
   cornices and rosettes. It's in perfect condition. We had absolutely no
   idea it was there and we were literally lost for words when we saw it.
   I'm looking forward to posting lots of pictures here over the next few
   weeks. Stay tuned! Also follow us on Facebook for more frequent updates
   :-)

   This is the tin ceiling as it looked in the Tremont Hotel back in 1897
   (our building is the only remaining part of the old hotel)
   Nice goat!

Photo shoot props.

   Vintage paint by number painting are so fun for photo shoots. They're
   getting harder and harder to find in junk stores these days - we have a
   few but I'm always looking for them!

Spring Fling at Cartolina!

   Let's celebrate the first weekend of spring with a Spring Fling at
   Cartolina! This weekend, if you order any iPhone case from
   www.cartolina.com we'll include a lovely selection of floral cards from
   our newest Curious Collection. That's a great deal for you, and a very
   pretty way to say hello to spring :)

Cartolina - Movin' on up!

   A new year and a new location for Cartolina!
   We are so excited to announce that we are moving Cartolina wholesale
   operations into a new location - AND opening our very first retail
   store this spring in Nelson BC!
   [Screen+shot+2014-03-02+at+8.35.16+AM.png]
   Cartolina wholesale has outgrown its current location and so, last
   year, we set to work trying to find the perfect space to move the
   entire operation into. A couple of months ago we noticed a great old
   heritage building for sale on Nelson's main street and after a lot of
   thought we decided to bite the bullet, buy the building and start
   planning for our new downtown Nelson HQ! The building was built in
   1880, it used to be part of the Tremont Hotel. It's a lovely old brick
   building with lots of character - high ceilings, brick interior walls
   and wood floors. The front of the building has a fabulous vintage
   storefront - so, along with a great big, new wholesale department, we
   are delighted to be planning our first ever foray into the world of
   brick and mortar retail!
   I can't wait to start documenting the transformation - the building has
   been home to a restaurant for many years and it will be fun to reveal
   and restore the old character. I will try to post regular updates on
   the progress. But, in the mean time, I need to start planning the
   store, oh yay! So, if you are familiar with the Cartolina style, and
   you think you might have a product that would compliment our vintage
   inspired designs, send me your wholesale information. Can't wait to
   hear from you! (email at info@cartolina.com)

   shows in Atlanta, London and New York. And we are really excited to
   start selling all our pretty things in South America starting in March.
   So all those Brazilian fans we have will be able to buy Cartolina in
   their local stores - I'm so excited about that  :-)   Let me know if
   you'd like more info, wholesale catalogs etc.

End grain block floor at the studio!

   You may have seen this at Poppytalk yesterday. This is the new 'end
   grain block'  floor that we have in the workshop at the studio. Doug
   completed it this past weekend and I've been dying to share it with
   you. More details after the pictures!
   [7.JPG] [6.jpg]
   [8.JPG]
   [1.JPG]
   As part of our ongoing project to update the Cartolina studio we
   decided that we needed a workshop.
   Doug built an addition onto the studio and decided to finish the floor
   using 'end grain block flooring'. It's actually a really old style of
   flooring that was commonly used on factory floors in the 19th century.
   We had some leftover beam ends in the shed from a previous project -
   kiln dried fir- and he set to work, slicing them up into 3" x 7"
   blocks, about 3/4 inches thick. It took him quite a long time to slice
   up all the blocks and sand the edges.
   Once he had prepared 850 blocks he glued them to the plywood floor
   using a non water based, flexible flooring adhesive.
   It was back breaking work(so he tells me!) As soon as it was dry he
   applied a coat of Watco oil stain and 2 coats of oil based clear
   finish. The results are spectacular. It has the look of cobble stones
   but with a rustic and warm feel. And best of all, it only cost the
   price of the glue and the finish!

New updated Cartolina app!

   Did you update your Cartolina app this week? You may have noticed that
   we added 12 new Cartograms to the app which gives you a total of 57
   ways to send something brief, but beautiful, to your friends and
   family! We also updated the icon and the splash page - since it's been
   3 years since we first launched the Cartolina app!

   the Cartolina iPhone apps right here or you can simply go to iTunes and
   download it.
   Search 'Cartolina' on your app store app, on your phone, for the
   fastest and most direct download. And the best thing is, you can use
   the Cartograms over and over and all for one price of $1.99!

Stepping sideways

   Tis the season for holiday gift guides and I'm excited that our iPhone
   cases have been chosen to appear in a few high profile ones coming up
   in the next few weeks.
   I was asked by a couple of writers why we took the sideways leap into
   iPhone cases. It's a good question, here's what I said:
   "Doug and I have had iPhones since the first week they launched -
   before they were even available in Canada. We hopped across the border
   and bought them in the US. A few years after that we became members of
   the Apple Developers Program and developed 3 pretty Cartolina iPhone
   apps which have been tremendously successful and we are very proud of
   them.
   After launching the very first app, The Cartolina App, we were asked
   many times by users to consider designing iPhone cases. I thought it
   was an interesting idea but since I was sporting a very practical pink
   rubber case on my phone I wasn't exactly a fashionista in the iPhone
   case realm! But our users persisted and I started to take a serious
   look at what was available in good quality, stylish cases.
   I was really surprised that there were very few cases available on the
   market for the sophisticated buyer - unless they wanted fake diamond
   encrusted, plastic quilted, 'gold' plated, smiling skulls on their
   phones. There were some nice arty cases featuring illustrations from
   talented artists but they were very very specific.
   Cartolina's cases fill a niche. Beautiful vintage imagery applied to a
   hard glossy surface is classic - it's like porcelain or enamel - every
   detail is enhanced by the mirror like shine. Our cases make your phone
   feel brand new with the tight fit and cool touch. The gorgeous images
   wrap right around the sides of your phone and smooth finish makes it
   super easy to slide the case in and out of your pocket or your purse.
   We love paper products at Cartolina and are busy designing a whole new
   card collection right now, but iPhone cases are here to stay and,
   judging by the response, to our first collection of 31 cases we're here
   to stay too."

   All our cases can be found at www.cartolina.com

   We partnered with the New Bedford Whaling Museum in MA to produce this

Shipping room table - revisited!

   Update: We've been asked over and over again to post these plans for
   our shipping room table again. So here they are . . . don't forget to
   send us picture if you build one, we'd love to see yours!
   The Table (and the DIY plans!):
   When I started looking for the perfect shipping room table I was really
   surprised that the options I was looking for were just not available.
   So, Doug to the rescue - he designed and built this GREAT table for me
   using plumbers, cast iron pipes and fittings. It's 8ft long and has a
   heavy wood work surface. When Doug started to design the table we were
   surprised that there were no plans available online for a table like
   this.  I knew that, as soon as I revealed the table here, loads of you
   would have questions for him about the construction.
   So, Doug has put together the plans for the table and you can download
   them, for free, from here - 'Table Plans"
   Our table is 35.5 inches high - which is great for a kitchen island or
   a work table. You can definitely shorten it for a dining room
   table. The pipes are all cut at the plumbers supply shop (you just need
   to take the plans into the shop with you and they cut and thread the
   pieces). The top is 8ft long and 32 inches wide - made from rough
   lumber from the lumber yard - sanded and varnished. You could also use
   reclaimed lumber for a wonderful vintage look!

Happy weekend everyone!

   It's been 3 weeks since we launched the Cartolina iPhone case
   collection and it's been so much fun. For the first time in Cartolina
   history we completely sold out our entire inventory in less than 10
   days. Fortunately everything is back in stock and available on our
   website again - phew (that was stressful!). Thank you to everyone who
   has ordered cases for their stores and to everyone who has purchased a
   case on our website - we are extremely grateful and touched by the
   overwhelmingly positive response. have a lovely weekend everyone!
