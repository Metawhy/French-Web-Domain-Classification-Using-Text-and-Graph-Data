     Young chimpanzees learn almost everything from their moms. When
     they’re confused, scared, curious, or proud, they lean on their moms
     for comfort and affirmation. I’ve learned so much about being a
     mother from Mother Nature herself; specifically how crushing it is
     when families are disrupted. Thankfully, through the healing work
     led by Jim and Jenny Desmond, these extraordinary individuals are
     recovering and receive 24-hour care. With our support, LCRP can get
     closer to achieving their dream of building a protected sanctuary,
     where these resilient and deserving animals can live a more natural
     and robust life as they deserve.”   - Kate Mara

   LCRP is the first and only chimpanzee sanctuary and conservation center
   in Liberia rescuing chimpanzees who are victims of the illegal bushmeat
   and pet trades. More than 40 orphaned chimpanzees, nearly all under the
   age of five, are currently under the care of LCRP. Each month, more
   captive chimpanzees are confiscated, allowing for the enforcement of
   Liberia's wildlife laws. Without the ability to confiscate wildlife,
   authorities cannot protect and preserve chimpanzees.
   Because we believe all wildlife and animal welfare issues are
   interconnected, LCRP supports broad-based public awareness campaigns.
   We not only support chimpanzee related initiatives, but also
   vaccination and rabies control programs, emerging disease research,
   legislative development and conservation action planning.
   Located in a chimpanzee range state, LCRP plays a key role in driving
   initiatives and leveraging support to protect and conserve wild
   individuals and populations. Our work directly impacts the capacity of
   wildlife organizations to develop and implement conservation programs
   and encourage community involvement.

Help us build a forever home for orphaned chimps

   Picture Aerial view of the sanctuary site. Your donation will help
   build necessary facilities to give orphaned chimps a permanent home.
   ​In 2018, LCRP acquired 100 acres of forested land from the local
   community.
   ​
   This was a huge step forward for the establishment of the sanctuary, as
   we now have a real place to call home – our Hundred Acre Wood!
   ​This land is set in the Marshall Wetlands, a beautiful and important
   estuarine habitat with vast mangrove forests and unique biodiversity.
   The area is a proposed protected area, meaning long term security,
   community partnerships and ecotourism opportunities.
   We very excited to relocate the chimps to this beautiful and natural
   new home, but must first raise the money to build proper facilities,
   ensuring happy and healthy chimpanzees, a great working environment for
   the team and a Conservation Center, the first of its kind in Liberia.

   Orphaned baby chimps like Ellie can live to be 50 - 60 years of age,
   and need proper care since they no longer have their mothers and
   original family members.
   Picture
   Jimmy Desmond is one of only two veterinarians in Liberia. His
   qualifications, expertise and dedication are key to the survival of the
   orphaned chimps at LCRP.
   Picture
   As part of the Desmond family, Princess, a rescued dog, has
   demonstrated her own special gift for saving animals and has been a
   “nanny” to many of the orphaned chimps.
   Picture
   LCRP founder, Jenny Desmond gives comfort to a resident orphan. In the
   wild, baby chimps will be nursed by their mothers for about 5 years,
   getting constant physical affection and reassurance.
   Picture
   This traumatized, orphaned chimp finally rests as he's cuddled at the
   LCRP. Physical affection from trained, experienced caregivers is
   crucial to the health and happiness of infant chimpanzees like this
   one.

every donation makes a difference!

   ​We're incredibly appreciative of your support for our chimps and for
   LCRP's work and can't do this work without your love and compassion!
   Every dollar goes a LONG way to ensuring the care, protection and
   survival of chimpanzees throughout Liberia and the world. ​​

the sanctuary - our hundred acre wood

   We need your help to build proper facilities so orphaned chimpanzees
   will have a forever home.
   ​In December 2017, LCRP purchased a 25 year lease on 100 acres of
   forested land from the local community.
   This was a huge step forward for the establishment of the sanctuary, as
   we now have a real place to call home – our Hundred Acre Wood!
   This land is set in the Marshall Wetlands, a beautiful and important
   estuarine habitat with vast mangrove forests and unique biodiversity.
   The area is a proposed protected area, meaning long term security,

   We very excited to relocate the chimps to this beautiful and natural
