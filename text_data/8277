About Hyderabad

   Hyderabad, a home for 8 million people, is the capital of Indian state
   of Andhra Pradesh. Known for its rich history and culture with
   monuments, mosques, temples and a rich and varied heritage in arts,
   crafts and dance, this 400-year city sees the traditional and the
   modern co-existing perfect harmony.

   Hyderabad was once a global center of the diamond and pearls trade, for
   which it is known by the sobriquet City of Pearls. Since 1990's
   Hyderabad has become a global city, with strengths in the commerce,
   education, entertainment, healthcare, professional services, research
   and transport—all contributing to its prominence. The city has
   significantly emerged as a global hub for the information technology
   industry. With various software firms, call centers, and business
   process outsourcing (BPO) companies, Hyderabad has become one of the
   key areas for such information technology (IT) and IT-enabled service
   set-ups. More than 500 software houses have their presence in
   Hyderabad. Almost every large software company (Microsoft, Google,
   Facebook, IBM, Accenture, Oracle, CA, GE, to name a few), in addition
   to many home grown software product and service organizations make
   Hyderabad a very attractive IT destination.
