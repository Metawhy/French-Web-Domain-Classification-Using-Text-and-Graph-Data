Stateless Password Manager

   Stop wasting your time synchronizing your encrypted vault. Remember one
   master password to access your passwords, anywhere, anytime. No sync
   needed.

   How does it work?

Compute your password offline

   LessPass computes a unique password using a site, login and a master
   password. You don't need to sync a password vault across every device
   because LessPass works offline!
   LessPass demo

   Manage complex passwords with LessPass options (only numbers, length,
   etc...)
   LessPass options

   Change generated password without changing your master password.
   Increment the counter field in your options.
   LessPass counter

   Detect an error in your master password without revealing it. Memorize
   your fingerprint:
   "I like to eat in this luxury liner".

Use LessPass Database for complex passwords

   We all know sites with stupid password rules. For this kind of site, we
   created a "connected" version to memorize the options. Sign in, load or
   save complex password profiles on LessPass Database.
   LessPass Database

Can you see the source code
of your current password manager?

   To us, a password manager is only as secure as it is transparent.
   That's why LessPass is fully open source. Don't just take our word for
   it, take a peek under the hood and see for yourself! View on GitHub
