Go Ducks!

   School pride is on display when our scholar-athletes are at home
   competing. Individual and team accomplishments at national tournaments,
   including NCAA championships, have contributed to our profile and
   reputation.

Passionate About the Arts

   Stevens' performing arts community encourages all students to
   participate in the arts – music, theater and dance –  onstage or behind
   the scenes. A scene from a production of Avenue Q.

Celebrating Diversity

   Our students come from around the world, adding to the richness of
   campus culture with their unique heritage. The annual Unity Carnival
   features games and performances – music, drama and dance – celebrating
   student culture and heritage.

Study Break

   Stevens' beautiful campus directly facing Manhattan offers plenty of
   scenic spots to meet up with friends, or to simply take a moment of
   reflection in between classes.

Bon Appétit!

   A variety of campus eateries offer plenty of options to enjoy a meal or
   a coffee break with fellow students in a comfortable setting. Some even
   have Hudson River views!

Rock On

   Music and technology majors aren't the only ones to express their love
   of music on campus. Outdoor music festivals like the OnPoint Music &
   Arts Festival and Stevens' radio station WCPR are just some of the
   outlets that showcase our students' passion for music and art.

Greek Life

   Members of the 16 Greek-Letter organizations at Stevens form life-long

This Stevens 3D-Printed Piece Could Revolutionize Spinal Fusion Surgery

Graduate student-designed scaffold performs like human bone, personalizes

   Eight cents.

   That's all it costs to 3D-print a simple yet deceptively complex
   inch-and-a-quarter-wide plastic scaffold that could pave the way for
   surgeons to help patients regrow spinal bone tissue much more quickly
   and effectively.

   Stevens Institute of Technology biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate
   Constance Maglaras, principal designer of the patent-pending
   technology, was recently awarded top prize in the graduate-poster
   division at Johnson & Johnson's 2017 Engineering Showcase for her
   poster and presentation, "Interconnective Strut Based, Bioresorbable
   Bone Scaffolds: The Future of Orthopaedic Fusion."

   "This project is innovative, inspiring and full of hope for patients
   suffering from vertebral injuries. It brings together emerging
   technologies that will soon personalize healthcare in unimaginable
   ways," noted Johnson & Johnson Senior Director of Engineering and
   Design Jose Abreu. "We at Johnson & Johnson strive to improve the lives
   of all patients who use our products. This project aligns beautifully
   with our core principles."

   Maglaras, who previously completed Stevens undergraduate and master's
   degrees, has worked since her sophomore year on innovations that aid
   spinal orthopedics. Thesis advisor Tony Valdevit, a biomedical
   engineering professor who has taught and supervised her research for
   seven years, is pleased with the work that culminated in her thesis and
   the prize-winning presentation.

   "I knew her device would work well," says Valdevit. "We didn't know it
   would work this well."

Building a better scaffold for new vertebrae to grow on

   Patients with spinal injuries preparing for spinal fusion surgery
   require implants. Traditional techniques require doctors to use
   autografts (bone removed from elsewhere in the patient, usually the
   pelvis), cadaver-sourced bone, or synthetic bone in those implants to
   aid in the fusion process.

   New techniques explored by Maglaras could help enable the production of
   implants crafted of each patient's own mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
   The cells can be cultured for about one month outside the body on
   plastic scaffolds, where they begin to grow into osteoblasts (bone
   cells) until they resemble human bone.

   Image of cell scaffold

   However, it has proven challenging to optimize the shape of the
   artificial scaffold. Stem cells require nourishment from surrounding
   liquid media as they grow, so the scaffold must include adequate
   spacing to allow the life-giving brew to flow deep enough into the
   center of the device. The device must also be strong enough to
   withstand repeated compressions as a patient walks, twists, lifts and
   moves.

   "It's a difficult mix to get right," notes Maglaras, who says she went
   through dozens of iterations before determining the best shape, which
   hinges on hundreds of connected, microscopic struts within the center
   of the device. "And getting a printer to also print this complex shape
   correctly was another challenge."

   The proof was in the load testing.

   "As soon as we saw it come off the printer, we looked at each other and
   knew this was 'it,' " Maglaras recalls.

   "I thought it would be very good mechanically," adds Valdevit. "It
   turned out to exceed my expectations, both in terms of the strength
   under compression and the fatigue testing. She tested 5 million cycles
   at 20 hertz, increasing the load with each test. The piece compressed,
   but it didn't break."

Customizing implants to each patient's needs

   "What makes this special is that it can withstand loads greater than
   the human spine normally needs to," notes Maglaras. "No other scaffold
   that I've come across is so lightweight and can withstand such loads.
   Once the cells have matured within the scaffold, it is almost like
   implanting a piece of customized bone, because it is made of the
   patient's own cells. Theoretically, there is no immunological risk in
   the process."

   The scaffold can even be customized to an individual patient's
   physiology and bone-mineral density, she adds, by tweaking its design
   based on CT scans of a patient.

   "That's personalizing the medicine here in the truest sense," she says.

   After graduating in spring 2017, Maglaras is studying the possibility
   of seeking potential investors to create a startup based on the
   scaffold and attempting to commercialize or license the technology —
   "that would be very exciting," she says — while continuing to refine
   the design.

   It's also possible she might enter the medical device industry instead,
   to work on further innovations that will benefit orthopedic practice.
   Valdevit has no doubt Maglaras will succeed on her chosen path.

   "She has been a model student since day one," he says. "If she has a
   question, if she doesn't know something, she'll ask directly. And if
   she already knows the answer, if she knows what she needs to do, she is
   smart enough to just go and do it in the lab. I've also seen her teach
   and she's very, very good at that as well. We're very proud of her."
