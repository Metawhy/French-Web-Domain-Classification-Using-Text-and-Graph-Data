   Interesting facts

   The strawberry hermit crab is an arthropod from the Coenobitidae
   family, like the coconut crab. It is called the strawberry hermit crab
   because of its color, which can range from orange to black, passing
   through an entire palette of reds, even bright red. It is indigenous,
   widespread in the Indo-Pacific, and very abundant in Tetiaroa
   (especially on Reiono). In terms of its habitat, it is often found
   close to coasts because it needs a regular source of sea water for
   internal osmoregulation and breathing. The hermit crab is equipped with
   a shell from a marine gastropod which it adapts to protect its soft
   abdomen. Its shell is used as protection from shock or drying out to
   preserve important organs like the liver and the gonads. The strawberry
   hermit crab is more active at night, like the coconut crab. It can live
   around 25-30 years in nature and measures around 80 mm. When mating
   time comes, the male deposits a spermatophore on the female who
   dissolves it to fertilize the eggs. After some time used taking care of
   the eggs, the females deposit them on a humid rock where they will
   rejoin the lagoon thanks to the rising tide. As for food, they are
   detritivores capable of eating all that is organic (ex: wood or dead
   animals).

   Fun Fact: When they find shells that are bigger than their own,
   strawberry hermit crabs gather in a line from biggest to smallest, and
   when the biggest hermit crab changes its shell, the next one takes the
   newly empty shell and the rest of the line does the same thing in a
   chain reaction.

It started with an idea...

     It is my hope that the island will serve as an ecological model...
     not only a tourist preserve but a marine preserve as well a place
     for all manner of scientific research and investigation...

about us

   Tetiaroa Society (TS) is a US-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization,
   OUR MISSION is to ensure island and coastal communities have a future
   as rich as their past – strengthening their resilience to global
   change, enhancing their ecosystem services, and preserving their
   culture.

   Grounded in our experience and actions on Tetiaroa, OUR VISION is an
   Island Earth Initiative that weaves enlightened values, traditional
   wisdom, and scientific understanding into a new fabric for our common
   island home.







   Current Actions: Designated by the atoll's owners as the environmental
   steward of Tetiaroa with authority and responsibility to manage,
   conserve and protect the entire island, our program objectives are
   summarized in our Conservation and Sustainable Use Plan. Under that
   plan, TS develops and carries out conservation and education, hosts
   scientific research, and curates the island's knowledge-base. We
   partner with The Brando to introduce resort guests to the nature and
   culture of the island, and to establish Tetiaroa as a model for
   island/earth sustainability where businesses and charities work
   together for the benefit of communities and nature.
