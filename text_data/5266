Our Complicated Journey ~ Arend Richard

   When we started out looking for a company to help us achieve our goals
   of developing a mobile app, we had no idea where to go or what do to.
   We had a unique start because, our business was started out necessity
   instead of a great idea.

eCommerce Site Development - Juan Mira

   I recommend Brainvire 100%, we're currently using them for the
   development of a Magento site which contains over 60 thousand products.
   Their ability to address all aspects of an eCommerce site of this
   magnitude has exceeded my expectations since the beginning.
   6 months ago

Great Company -- Excellent Support and Service

   We have been using Brainvire for 19 months for all of our Magento and
   development needs. They have helped us grow our online business
   exponentially. Highly recomended.
   9/10/17

Excellent Value and Quality Work

   BrainVire is an excellent IT consulting company. They were able to take
   my ideas and turn them into an excellent product. They have also given
   me a great deal of direction and solved problems for me that I was not
   ready to handle on my own. If you are in the market for IT work you
   must contact them to see what they can do for you.
   9/10/17

Client Testimonials

   They're very cost-effective considering what we've asked them to do.
   Brainvire provides high-quality custom code and superior project
   management at a reasonable price. Despite the language barrier, they
   collaborate well with multiple teams and excel at communication. They
   are also good at explaining technical matters to non-technical staff.

   Mr. Dan Weber

   Chief Strategy Officer, Furniture Manufacturer
   Brainvire is a reliable partner. Chintan [Shah] really cares that we
   are happy with the results.
   The new e-commerce store receives a lot of compliments and logistically
   the business now operates more cohesively. The team makes an effort to
   respond to requests effectively and efficiently, and go out of their
   way to please, earning themselves more and more responsibilities.

   Carlos Antillano

   Head of E-Commerce - La Cuisine International
   Their work ethic stands out most to me, and they’re proactive with
   communication.
   The platform received positive feedback and is still undergoing
   enhancements and expansions. Though Brainvire can sometimes move too
   quickly and sacrifice quality, responsiveness and project management
   was consistent and reliable, even despite the time difference. Overall,
   they exceed expectations.

   Mr. Greg Pietsch

   Founder – The Value Compass
   They make every effort to be there for me when I need them.
   The new backend has successfully automated many of the production
   steps, promoting efficiency and allowing internal leadership to focus
   elsewhere. Brainvire Infotech’s accessibility, reliability, and strong
   customer service continue to impress.

   Adam

   Chief Commercial Officer, Novelty Product Manufacter
   [Their CEO] didn’t just pass us over to one of the project managers and
   forget us. I really appreciate the personal touch.
   The team at Brainvire is thorough and has an impressive attention to
   detail. They value relationship-building and take responsibility for
   the project. Though the time difference can present challenges, they do
   their best to communicate in a timely manner and have been reliable
   thus far.

   David Byun

   Founder, CGETC
   Even though they have global resources, it felt as if Brainvire was
   working from our office.
   The provider's international presence offers broad expertise in tandem
   with the development team’s small-scale operations, ensuring on-trend
   tech solutions with a personal touch. Brainvire’s efforts continue to
   support better supply-chain control and style predictions.

   Tim Eynon

   Former CEO, Provogue
   Brainvire took our ideas and came back with an incredibly digestible
   and rich set of requirements documents
   Having had previous experience with Brainvire, the client was eager to
   use them for his own project. Their accessibility and ability to
   properly set expectations, even despite scope creep, has helped make
   the project a success.

   Daniel Coburn

   Co-founder, Bragshare
   The investment with them is probably 1/5 of what I would have had to
   invest in another development company for the same work.
   The client attributes strong sales growth to the quality of Brainvire's
   resources and the quickness with which they resolve support issues. The
   client wishes their domestic presence was larger but enjoys the huge
   cost savings.

   Kevin Clor

   COO, Tent and Table
   A sense of ownership and resilience are the 2 things we definitely
   enjoyed about Brainvire.
   Brainvire’s help has kept development on track, and they take ownership
   of their deliverables every week. The Brainvire team understands
   priorities and manages expectations and themselves well. They’re
   responsible, reliable, and work around the clock to deliver.

   Sudeep Sharma

   CTO, Vavni
   The app looks sleek with a good user interface — in fact, I’m surprised
   that it came out so nicely.
   Despite the limited budget, Brainvire delivered an app with an
   attractive visual design and user-friendly navigation. Brainvire’s team
   is responsive, friendly, and professional. The communication is both
   detailed and prompt, which helps keep the project on track.

   Mr. Pranav Desai

   Founder, Voice of Specially Abled People
   Brainvire went out of their way to make sure the project would be
   delivered on time.
   The innovation and accommodation Brainvire deploys for a project is
   impressive. Their product has significantly improved customer
   satisfaction and created an industry standard.

   Shivabalan Athmaraman

   Founder, Veritas
   Brainvire's resources are trained in the newest technologies and are
   proactive in terms of communication.
   Brainvire’s team demonstrated technical prowess with the most advanced
   technologies, as well as a firm commitment to client satisfaction and
   project management.

   Sumit Sheth

   Practice Head, InfoGain
   Brainvire’s team is perfectly managed, and they deliver what they say.
   Brainvire is proactive and reliable. Daily orders went from as low as 2
   to as high as 80 since they started their project, and their assistance
   also brought front page search engine optimization results. They could
   improve in content writing, but they excel in precise cost projections
   and timelines

   Mr. Mohammad Fazullah

   IT Director of Zafco
   We wanted to get a reliable, long-term partner who had specific
   experience in the digital and mobile space.
   Brainvire is scalable, flexible and highly responsive. Their main app
   project handles 2 million unique visitors a day, and results in
   steadily renewed contracts. They manage complex algorithms well, and
   although they could expand their services, regular meetings with their
   CEO ensure accountability.

   Dilip Kukreja

   Reviewer Vice President, Indian Media Outlet
   Their ability to perceive needs that I’m going to have … before I'm
   even aware of them was fantastic..
   Brainvire was established as a valuable resource due to an attractive
   price, excellent project management, and transparency. They’re
   accommodating and organized, and yield a proactive and intuitive
   approach. Deliverables have been accurate and visually appealing
   throughout the ongoing relationship.
