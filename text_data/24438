Butterfly Unit Study

   Filed in Caterpillars and Butterflies, Insects and Bugs
   We recently had a lot of fun doing a unit about butterflies. My kids
   don‚Äôt like the idea of doing school work during the summer, but we had
   so much fun that they didn‚Äôt even realize they were learning.
   We started off by receiving some caterpillars in the mail. They are so
   tiny when they come! The day we received them the kids drew pictures in
   their nature journals of what they looked like and then wrote a
   sentence about what they observed.
   Once they reached the chrysalis stage we moved them out of the little
   cup and into our butterfly net. We made new drawings in our nature
   journals and added a sentence about what was observed.
   Lastly, we were able to observe the butterflies. We kept them for a few
   days and fed them sugar water.
   The kids drew pictures of our painted lady butterflies in their nature
   journals.
   Finally, we let our butterflies go.
   We made these fun lapbooks from Around the Kampfire.
   On one of the flaps they drew pictures of the life cycle of the
   butterfly and labeled what each step in the cycle is.
   Inside the lapbook, there is a spot to label the parts of a butterfly,
   a place to write about how butterflies help plants grow, and a little
   flip book about butterflies. On one of the leaves we added some sesame
   seeds to represent the eggs. We did a fun activity to help the kids
   understand pollination. I forgot to take pictures, so I‚Äôll try to
   describe it. I cut out flower shaped papers and put crunched up cheese
   puffs in the middle to represent pollen. Then the kids made a butterfly
   shape out of pipe cleaner. The butterflies flew to a flower and landed
   on the ‚Äúpollen.‚Äù After walking on the ‚Äúpollen,‚Äù they flew to a
   different flower shaped piece of paper and walked around on it. They
   were able to see how the pollen was left behind on the new flower.
   Inside the leaves on the trees we wrote more about butterflies, like
   where they lay their eggs, what they eat, and how they protect
   themselves.
   This was such a fun unit! My kids didn‚Äôt even know that they were doing
   science or practicing their reading and writing.

Bee Unit Study

   Filed in Bees, Insects and Bugs

   How is it possible that it‚Äôs been three years since I last posted?  I
   decided that I am going to start trying to post again now that it feels
   like life has slowed down a little bit.

   We finished up school a few weeks ago and one of our favorite units was
   learning about bees.  I hadn‚Äôt actually planned on blogging about this,
   so I only have a few pictures that I took with my phone.

   Bee Unit Study

   After we spent a few days learning about bees, we drew and labeled bees
   in our science nature journals.

   Bee Unit Study

   We also studied the life cycle of a honey bee.

   Bee Unit Study

   Hunter is looking at a sesame seed with his magnifying glass.  We
   learned that a bee‚Äôs brain is the size of a sesame seed.  It‚Äôs pretty
   amazing all of the things that bees can do with such tiny brains.

   Bee Unit Study

   We took a field trip to learn more about bees.

   Field trip- looking at the life cycle

   Field trip- looking at the different kinds of bees

   Bee Unit Study

   Field trip- doing activities with hexagons

   Bee Unit Study

   We made some bee art.  The kids had to make a queen bee, a worker bee,
   and a drone.  Each one has different characteristics that they had to
   represent in their bee drawings.

   Learning about bees has definitely made us less scared of them.  Now
   when a bee comes near one of us we just say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to hurt
   me, it‚Äôs just trying to pollinate.‚Äù

ArtAchieve Review

   Filed in Art, Curriculum, Review

   ArtAchieve

   Without a doubt, Hailey‚Äôs favorite subject is art.  She is also very
   good at it.  Me?  Not so much.  I can find cute activities for her to
   recreate, but as far as actually teaching art and art techniques- I
   don‚Äôt have a clue.  For most of the school year we attend a weekly
   co-op and she takes an art class there.  But, that ended at the end of
   April and Hailey has been asking me if she can take some art
   classes. For the past several weeks she has been using the Entire Level
   II from ArtAchieve for her weekly art lessons.

   Art Lessons for Children ArtAchieve Review

   ArtAchieve is an online resource of art lessons for kids.  The lessons
   are very complete and there isn‚Äôt much you as the teacher will have to
   do, other than gather supplies.  There are 5 different levels available
   at ArtAchieve.  The lessons can be used for any age from kindergarten
   on up.  Even adults can use these lessons!  You will just need to
   choose the best level to start at depending on the ability of the your
   art student.  Within each level there are several different art
   lessons.  We reviewed the Entire Level II and there are 14 different
   lessons on that level.

                 Art Lessons for Children ArtAchieve Review

   The lessons are available as a video where your child will watch a
   teacher and follow the instructions.  The lessons are also available as
   a PowerPoint, which is how we chose to use the program so that Hailey
   could do the lessons at her own pace.

   ArtAchieve

   Each lesson starts out by showing the art standards that the lesson
   will meet.

   ArtAchieve

    Then there will be a picture of the object that the lesson is about.
   This picture is from the Japanese Goldfish lesson.  There are several
   slides with information about the object.  Not actually included in the
   PowerPoint presentation, but given on the website for each lesson, are
   ideas to make cross-curricular connections.  With the Japanese Goldfish
   lesson there are ideas to connect it to Social Studies, Science,
   Writing, Literature, Geography, and of course, art.

   ArtAchieve

    Next you will find a slide with the materials that will be needed
   within the lesson.

   ArtAchieve

    Next up will be a relaxation technique to help get your child ready to
   create art.

   ArtAchieve

   Relaxation is followed by a drawing warm up that will need to printed
   out ahead of time.  Music is also an important part of these lessons
   and students should listen to some quiet music to while they work.
   Finally there are a few rules to go over before starting the drawing
   part of the lesson.

   ArtAchieve

   Now it is time to draw.  There are step by step directions to guide
   your child through the drawing.

   ArtAchieve

   When the drawing is finished there will be instructions to color or
   paint the drawing, depending on what is being used for that particular
   lesson.  There are some suggestions given, but the rest is up to your
   child.

   ArtAchieve

   Hailey‚Äôs finished fish.

    Here are a few other projects that Hailey worked on:

   ArtAchieve

   This lesson about the Czech Cat is available for free, so you are able
   to see how this homeschool art curriculum works and see if it would be
   a good fit for you.

   ArtAchieve

   Hailey‚Äôs finished cat.

   ArtAchieve

   Hailey also worked on the Swedish Dala Horse.

   ArtAchieve

   The completed horse.

   ArtAchieve

    Another lesson Hailey did was the German Nutcracker.

   This art curriculum is perfect for us!  For the most part, the lessons
   are easy enough that Hailey can actually complete them without any help
   from me.  She has learned a lot and even asks to do the lessons during
   her summer vacation üôÇ  That is a sign of a fun curriculum!!

D is for Dinosaur

   Filed in Dinosaurs, Letter D, Preschool

   Our Crafts N Things

   When learning about the letter D, what could be more fun than turning
   it into a dinosaur theme?  I can‚Äôt think of anything better for a 4
   year old boy.  Hunter loved learning the letter D and all about
   dinosaurs.  This was definitely his favorite unit all year.

   Our Crafts N Things

    Hunter‚Äôs letter D bin was full of fun things for the week.  Harper
   kept taking her diaper out and putting it away haha, she didn‚Äôt
   understand why it was in the bin.

   Our Crafts N Things

    I printed out this letter D page from these preschool printables and
   then Hunter had to make the D using pattern blocks.

   Our Crafts N Things

   He spent lots of time playing with the little dinosaurs.  We used them
   for some math games too, like sorting, patterns, counting, etc.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Hunter and Harper enjoyed using the dinosaur stamps.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Hunter loved this dinosaur mat!  He has spent hours playing with this.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Hunter working on some dinosaur puzzles.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Finding and coloring the letter D.

   Our Crafts N Things

   We used painters tape to show how long some of the dinosaurs were.
   Hunter was pretty impressed with how big they were.  We weren‚Äôt able to
   do the really big dinosaurs because they were bigger than our house!

   Our Crafts N Things

   At the end of the tape I put a little fact card about the dinosaur the
   tape was representing.

   Our Crafts N Things

   We made dinosaur fossils by pressing little dinosaurs into modeling
   clay.

   Our Crafts N Things

   What would a dinosaur unit be without making a volcano?  Hunter liked
   doing the volcano but when the ‚Äúlava‚Äù came out of the mountain and
   touched his dinosaurs he was not happy.  So, the rest of our volcano
   fun had to be done without the dinosaurs nearby.

   Our Crafts N Things

   A representation of big a t-rex footprint was.

   Our Crafts N Things

   We had a little fossil dig to look for dinosaur bones.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Hunter working on finding some bones

   Our Crafts N Things

   Hailey helped too, it was actually really hard to get the bones out.

   Our Crafts N Things

   Then Hailey and Hunter took turns hiding some dinosaur bones in the
   sandbox and then searching for them.

   Learning about dinosaurs was our favorite unit this year!
