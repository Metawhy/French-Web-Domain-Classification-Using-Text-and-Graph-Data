ADW Mission

   The Animal Diversity Web is an online database and encyclopedia of
   animal natural history, built through contributions from students,
   photographers, and many others.

   It is a rich and flexible resource designed both as an encyclopedia for
   exploring biodiversity and for use in formal, inquiry-based education.
