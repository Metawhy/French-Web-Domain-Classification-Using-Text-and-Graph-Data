Dolphin Island

   TripAdvisor Traveller Rating Based on 0 reviews

   Meet the magnificent Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins – some of the
   most fascinating marine mammals of the oceans! Dolphin Island offers a
   range of programmes that will give you the opportunity to meet them
   up-close.
   Our unique programmes give you the chance to interact with the
   dolphins, which will be an unforgettable experience. More importantly,
   it will inspire visitors to a deeper understanding of marine life, and
   to discover more about dolphins through “engagement learning”. Our
   marine mammal trainers and hosts will share knowledge about dolphins,
   their habitats, diets, anatomies and migration patterns.
   We will also share what we’re doing in the areas of research and
   veterinary care to give you an idea of what’s being done to protect the
   dolphins. We can look forward to building a more sustainable marine
   environment together.
   Arrange your interaction session to learn more about the dolphins
   today!
