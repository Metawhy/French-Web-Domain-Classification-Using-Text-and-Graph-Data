# Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
>>> def fib(n):
>>>     a, b = 0, 1
>>>     while a < n:
>>>         print(a, end=' ')

Functions Defined
       The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python
       allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and
       even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in
       Python 3
     *
# Python 3: List comprehensions
>>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits)
['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']

# List and the enumerate function
>>> list(enumerate(fruits))
[(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]

Compound Data Types
       Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound
       data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced
       and manipulated with other built-in functions. More about lists in
       Python 3
     *
# Python 3: Simple arithmetic
>>> 1 / 2
0.5
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division
5

Intuitive Interpretation
       Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is
       straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work as expected;
       parentheses () can be used for grouping. More about simple math
       functions in Python 3.
     *
# Python 3: Simple output (with Unicode)
>>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
Hello, I'm Python!

# Input, assignment
>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
>>> print('Hi, %s.' % name)
What is your name?
Python
Hi, Python.

Quick & Easy to Learn
       Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python
       very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation
       structure easy to learn. Whet your appetite with our Python 3
       overview.
     *
# For loop on a list
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...    product = product * number
...
>>> print('The product is:', product)
The product is: 384

All the Flow You’d Expect
       Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages
       speak — if, for, while and range — with some of its own twists, of
       course. More control flow tools in Python 3

   Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and
   integrate systems more effectively. Learn More

# Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
>>> def fib(n):
>>>     a, b = 0, 1
>>>     while a < n:
>>>         print(a, end=' ')
>>>         a, b = b, a+b
>>>     print()
>>> fib(1000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

Functions Defined
       The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python
       allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and
       even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in
       Python 3
     *
# Python 3: List comprehensions
>>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits)
['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']

# List and the enumerate function
>>> list(enumerate(fruits))
[(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]

Compound Data Types
       Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound
       data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced
       and manipulated with other built-in functions. More about lists in
       Python 3
     *
# Python 3: Simple arithmetic
>>> 1 / 2
0.5
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division
5

Intuitive Interpretation
       Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is
       straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work as expected;
       parentheses () can be used for grouping. More about simple math
       functions in Python 3.
     *
# Python 3: Simple output (with Unicode)
>>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
Hello, I'm Python!

# Input, assignment
>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
>>> print('Hi, %s.' % name)
What is your name?
Python
Hi, Python.

Quick & Easy to Learn
       Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python
       very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation
       structure easy to learn. Whet your appetite with our Python 3
       overview.
     *
# For loop on a list
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...    product = product * number
...
>>> print('The product is:', product)
The product is: 384

All the Flow You’d Expect
       Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages
       speak — if, for, while and range — with some of its own twists, of
       course. More control flow tools in Python 3

   Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and
   integrate systems more effectively. Learn More
