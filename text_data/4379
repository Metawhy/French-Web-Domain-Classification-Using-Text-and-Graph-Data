   concealer because I love everything else from the SuperStay line! Also,
   I am a simple eyeshadow kind of [‚Ä¶]

   China Glaze Gone West

     Yee-Haw, the new China Glaze Gone West Collection is here! ü§† This
   dazzling collection consists of 5 shimmers, 2 cremes, and one metallic
   shade. Most of them only needed 2 coats, but the gold needed 3. Other
   than that, they all have a nice formula that is easy to work with.
