   Education, but her ultimate ambition in life has always been to be a
   full-time mom. Foregoing a career outside the home has meant constantly
   finding creative ways to save money, so InsomnoMom is shamelessly
   frugal. The House That Never Slumbers has always strived to live well
   below its means, maintaining a high credit score and low debt-to-income
   ratio. InsomnoMom was an extreme couponer long before it was popular.
   Living on a budget has never prevented the family from traveling
   because InsomnoMom is skilled at finding discounts and deals. As the
   name suggests, InsomnoMom is the Mom Who Never Sleeps at The House That
   Never Slumbers. She was just born a Night Owl, and all attempts to
   change that have been futile. InsomnoMom is the mother of four. She
