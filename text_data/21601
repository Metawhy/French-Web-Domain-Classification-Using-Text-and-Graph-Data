   Sofia Vergara’s stylish Los Angeles condo is currently on the rental
   market. The Modern Family star bought the luxury unit, which spans
   2,071 square feet and includes three bedrooms and three bathrooms, back
   in 2007 for $1.1 million, but she’s since upgraded her digs, purchasing
   a $10.6 million home in Beverly Hills in 2014. Vergara is currently
   seeking a renter for the condo, and is asking for $10,200 per month, a
   substantial bump up from the $7,200 a month she asked for when she
   rented it out back in 2015.

   According to a listing for the abode, the unit has been completely
   redone with high-end finishes over the last few years. The home opens
   onto a light-filled, window-lined space with separate living and dining
   areas, plus an upgraded galley kitchen with sleek, modern appliances.
   Dark, finished wood floors throughout stand in stark contrast to the
   white walls and cabinetry, and help to elevate the home’s aesthetic
   appeal.

   The master suite is a highlight of the home, with an impressive marble
   bathroom featuring an oversized deep-soaking tub and a separate
   glass-enclosed steam shower, a cavernous walk-in closet, and a unique
   three-way mirror. Building amenities include everything from 24-hour
   security to valet parking to an exercise room, a pool, and a sauna.

7 Celebrities to Follow on Instagram for Design Inspiration

   Architectural Digest has had the pleasure of peeking inside some of the
   most stylish homes in the world—many with famous owners. But just
   because a celebrity has amazing taste in decor or art does not
   necessarily mean they choose to show it off on Instagram. Some use
   their pages primarily for promoting their work; some are all about
   selfies; some share 365 outfits of the day per year; others entertain
   their followers with adorable pictures of their children.

   So while an art and architecture buff might be a fan of a particular
   actor's movies or a musician's songs, following them on social media
   may not yield much mood-board inspiration. That's why AD rounded up the
   celebrities who not only share our passions but share our passions on
   their Instagram pages enough to warrant a follow. Herewith, the stars
   who have an admirable penchant for art, architecture, design,
   interiors, and gardening.

   Karlie Kloss

   Everyone knows Kloss is a supermodel turned coder, but her Instagram
   makes it clear that she is also a world traveler who loves a cityscape.
   (Or an ocean view. Or a mountain scene, as evidenced by the many images
   she shared from her Wyoming wedding.) It is unclear exactly where Kloss
   and her husband, Joshua Kushner, currently reside, but at one time,
   they were New Yorkers, and she's used the Big Apple as a backdrop in
   quite a few posts. She's also shared powerful images of herself posing
   against the skylines of Detroit, Shanghai, and Paris...

   ...and on jaunts to such picturesque sites as Fogo Island, Canada,
   Marrakech, Morocco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the
   super-modern Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California.

       Gay Gassmann

   This may come as a surprise, but the funnyman famous for flicks like
   Pineapple Express, Superbad, and Sausage Party dedicates most of his
   page to posting his own handmade pottery and his collection of unique
   vintage ashtrays. Some of his rare finds include monogrammed Louis
   Vuitton and Gucci vessels, plus a midcentury one that doubles as a
   magazine rack—which he uses to hold a copy of AD.

   His love of design doesn't stop at smoking paraphernalia and vases,
   however. In November 2018, he shared pictures from a trip to
   Pennsylvania which included stops at Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater
   and the Mattress Factory Museum in Pittsburgh.

   Brooke Shields

   The supermodel resides in a gorgeous historic townhouse in New York
   City's Greenwich Village, which she and her husband restored and had
   decorated by David Flint Wood. AD toured the place in 2012, but in
   2019, Shields is still regularly showing it off, staging her photos
   with her chic furnishings visible in the background.

   She keeps up her penchant for posing with the decor when she's
   traveling as well. This summer, for example, she served a fierce look
   in front of a fancy armoire while in London.

   Celine Dion

   Great minds think alike. Just like Shields, Dion almost never posts a
   simple selfie showing only her face. The diva is amazing at using
   whatever is around her—be it voluminous drapes, marble floors, or a
   chic settee—to jazz up her pictures.

   Martha Stewart

   There's the carefully curated brand page @marthastewart, and then there
   is @marthastewart48, the personal handle of the lifestyle maven
   herself. Here, things are equally tasteful, but a bit more casual and
   fun. She shares all of the things you'd expect from Martha Stewart,
   like fresh-cut flowers, tablescapes, and recipes, and it is fascinating
   to see just how much she actually walks the walk. For example, not only
   did she share an antique lobster mold that she purchased in Maine this
   summer, but she later shared an update about how she actually used it
   to create a quirky and colorful dessert.

   Her garden is another highlight, and she often shares tips and tricks,
   plus snapshots of her thriving plants and many pets.

   The fashion world is where Abloh reigns supreme, but he’s also a fine
   artist, and he regularly shares his highly structural works on his
   page.

   And even when Abloh posts something related to his work as the artistic
   director of Louis Vuitton menswear, there’s a good chance architecture
   could be involved, like when the brand created a chic New York City
   pop-up shop this summer.

   Diane Keaton

   If there’s one thing all aesthetes can appreciate, it’s a cohesive
   visual story, and that’s what the House That Pinterest Built author and
   queen of black-and-white provides to her followers. Her feed is full of
   monochromatic rooms, general inspiration, and a healthy dose of quirk.

Cheryl Tiegs Lists Balinese-Style Bel Air Mansion for $18.5 Million

   Cheryl Tiegs’s supremely photogenic Bel Air mansion just returned to
   the market for $18.5 million. The former supermodel bought the 1950s
   ranch in 1996 for $2.5 million, and had it renovated into the
   Balinese-style sanctuary that it is today. Tiegs worked with then
   unknown designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard, and the project helped launch
   him into superstardom. (Since then, he’s worked with the likes of
   Christina Aguilera, Cher, Elton John, Kylie Jenner, and more.)

   Set on 1.43 acres, the one-story home spans 4,770 square feet, with an
   open floor plan meant to encourage the flow of good energy. Vaulted
   beamed ceilings and large windows give the hilltop house an airy feel,
   and the place boasts stunning views of the city. Other design details
   include glossy wood floors, stenciled wood beams, and grass cloth
   covering the high ceilings to add a sense of Balinese authenticity. The
   living room and dining rooms each have their own respective fireplaces,
   and are connected but clearly delineated. Other spaces in the sprawling
   main living area include a family room with a built-in entertainment
   unit and a cozy den.

   The kitchen revolves around a large butcher block–topped center island,
   and features dark brown wood cabinets offset by grass cloth panels and
   sliding glass doors that open to the yard outside. An intricate
   pressed-tin ceiling gives the space a unique look. Elsewhere in the
   home are four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, with some rather
   unusual design elements, including one en suite guest room with bright
   red wall panels and wall-to-wall zebra-striped carpeting (a stenciled
   black and red dragon on the ceiling completes the look). The master
   suite is a bit tamer, and has a sitting area, two-way fireplace, fitted
   walk-in closet, dressing area, and spa-like bathroom with a
   deep-soaking tub and connected glass-enclosed steam shower.

   Out back, the home boasts a kidney-shaped pool surrounded by tall palm
   trees and other tropical plants, as well as a separate guesthouse,
   numerous pathways, and fountains. A wine cellar and meditation pavilion
   with Japanese tea-stained rice wallpaper and seagrass rugs round out
   the home’s offerings.

   This is not the first time Tiegs has put the home on the market (it is
   listed with Jade Mills and Tiffany Mills at Coldwell Banker Global

Sofia Vergara’s Los Angeles Condo Is Available to Rent for $10,200 a Month

The Modern Family star bought the unit for $1.1 million back in 2007 and has
since renovated the space


    Joyce Chen

   September 23, 2019 5:15 PM

   Sofia Vergara’s stylish Los Angeles condo is currently on the rental
   market. The Modern Family star bought the luxury unit, which spans
   2,071 square feet and includes three bedrooms and three bathrooms, back
   in 2007 for $1.1 million, but she’s since upgraded her digs, purchasing
   a $10.6 million home in Beverly Hills in 2014. Vergara is currently
   seeking a renter for the condo, and is asking for $10,200 per month, a
   substantial bump up from the $7,200 a month she asked for when she
   rented it out back in 2015.

   According to a listing for the abode, the unit has been completely
   redone with high-end finishes over the last few years. The home opens
   onto a light-filled, window-lined space with separate living and dining
   areas, plus an upgraded galley kitchen with sleek, modern appliances.
   Dark, finished wood floors throughout stand in stark contrast to the
   white walls and cabinetry, and help to elevate the home’s aesthetic
   appeal.

   The master suite is a highlight of the home, with an impressive marble
   bathroom featuring an oversized deep-soaking tub and a separate
   glass-enclosed steam shower, a cavernous walk-in closet, and a unique
   three-way mirror. Building amenities include everything from 24-hour
   security to valet parking to an exercise room, a pool, and a sauna.

   Architectural Digest has had the pleasure of peeking inside some of the
   most stylish homes in the world—many with famous owners. But just
   because a celebrity has amazing taste in decor or art does not
   necessarily mean they choose to show it off on Instagram. Some use
   their pages primarily for promoting their work; some are all about
   selfies; some share 365 outfits of the day per year; others entertain
   their followers with adorable pictures of their children.

   So while an art and architecture buff might be a fan of a particular
   actor's movies or a musician's songs, following them on social media
   may not yield much mood-board inspiration. That's why AD rounded up the
   celebrities who not only share our passions but share our passions on
   their Instagram pages enough to warrant a follow. Herewith, the stars
   who have an admirable penchant for art, architecture, design,
   interiors, and gardening.

   Karlie Kloss

   Everyone knows Kloss is a supermodel turned coder, but her Instagram
   makes it clear that she is also a world traveler who loves a cityscape.
   (Or an ocean view. Or a mountain scene, as evidenced by the many images
   she shared from her Wyoming wedding.) It is unclear exactly where Kloss
   and her husband, Joshua Kushner, currently reside, but at one time,
   they were New Yorkers, and she's used the Big Apple as a backdrop in
   quite a few posts. She's also shared powerful images of herself posing
   against the skylines of Detroit, Shanghai, and Paris...

   ...and on jaunts to such picturesque sites as Fogo Island, Canada,
   Marrakech, Morocco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the
   super-modern Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California.

       Gay Gassmann

   This may come as a surprise, but the funnyman famous for flicks like
   Pineapple Express, Superbad, and Sausage Party dedicates most of his
   page to posting his own handmade pottery and his collection of unique
   vintage ashtrays. Some of his rare finds include monogrammed Louis
   Vuitton and Gucci vessels, plus a midcentury one that doubles as a
   magazine rack—which he uses to hold a copy of AD.

   His love of design doesn't stop at smoking paraphernalia and vases,
   however. In November 2018, he shared pictures from a trip to
   Pennsylvania which included stops at Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater
   and the Mattress Factory Museum in Pittsburgh.

   Brooke Shields

   The supermodel resides in a gorgeous historic townhouse in New York
   City's Greenwich Village, which she and her husband restored and had
   decorated by David Flint Wood. AD toured the place in 2012, but in
   2019, Shields is still regularly showing it off, staging her photos
   with her chic furnishings visible in the background.

   She keeps up her penchant for posing with the decor when she's
   traveling as well. This summer, for example, she served a fierce look
   in front of a fancy armoire while in London.

   Celine Dion

   Great minds think alike. Just like Shields, Dion almost never posts a
   simple selfie showing only her face. The diva is amazing at using
   whatever is around her—be it voluminous drapes, marble floors, or a
   chic settee—to jazz up her pictures.

   Martha Stewart

   There's the carefully curated brand page @marthastewart, and then there
   is @marthastewart48, the personal handle of the lifestyle maven
   herself. Here, things are equally tasteful, but a bit more casual and
   fun. She shares all of the things you'd expect from Martha Stewart,
   like fresh-cut flowers, tablescapes, and recipes, and it is fascinating
   to see just how much she actually walks the walk. For example, not only
   did she share an antique lobster mold that she purchased in Maine this
   summer, but she later shared an update about how she actually used it
   to create a quirky and colorful dessert.

   Her garden is another highlight, and she often shares tips and tricks,
   plus snapshots of her thriving plants and many pets.

   The fashion world is where Abloh reigns supreme, but he’s also a fine
   artist, and he regularly shares his highly structural works on his
   page.

   And even when Abloh posts something related to his work as the artistic
   director of Louis Vuitton menswear, there’s a good chance architecture
   could be involved, like when the brand created a chic New York City
   pop-up shop this summer.

   Diane Keaton

   If there’s one thing all aesthetes can appreciate, it’s a cohesive
   visual story, and that’s what the House That Pinterest Built author and
   queen of black-and-white provides to her followers. Her feed is full of
   monochromatic rooms, general inspiration, and a healthy dose of quirk.

Cheryl Tiegs Lists Balinese-Style Bel Air Mansion for $18.5 Million

   Cheryl Tiegs’s supremely photogenic Bel Air mansion just returned to
   the market for $18.5 million. The former supermodel bought the 1950s
   ranch in 1996 for $2.5 million, and had it renovated into the
   Balinese-style sanctuary that it is today. Tiegs worked with then
   unknown designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard, and the project helped launch
   him into superstardom. (Since then, he’s worked with the likes of
   Christina Aguilera, Cher, Elton John, Kylie Jenner, and more.)

   Set on 1.43 acres, the one-story home spans 4,770 square feet, with an
   open floor plan meant to encourage the flow of good energy. Vaulted
   beamed ceilings and large windows give the hilltop house an airy feel,
   and the place boasts stunning views of the city. Other design details
   include glossy wood floors, stenciled wood beams, and grass cloth
   covering the high ceilings to add a sense of Balinese authenticity. The
   living room and dining rooms each have their own respective fireplaces,
   and are connected but clearly delineated. Other spaces in the sprawling
   main living area include a family room with a built-in entertainment
   unit and a cozy den.

   The kitchen revolves around a large butcher block–topped center island,
   and features dark brown wood cabinets offset by grass cloth panels and
   sliding glass doors that open to the yard outside. An intricate
   pressed-tin ceiling gives the space a unique look. Elsewhere in the
   home are four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, with some rather
   unusual design elements, including one en suite guest room with bright
   red wall panels and wall-to-wall zebra-striped carpeting (a stenciled
   black and red dragon on the ceiling completes the look). The master
   suite is a bit tamer, and has a sitting area, two-way fireplace, fitted
   walk-in closet, dressing area, and spa-like bathroom with a
   deep-soaking tub and connected glass-enclosed steam shower.

   trees and other tropical plants, as well as a separate guesthouse,
   numerous pathways, and fountains. A wine cellar and meditation pavilion
   with Japanese tea-stained rice wallpaper and seagrass rugs round out
   the home’s offerings.

   This is not the first time Tiegs has put the home on the market (it is
   listed with Jade Mills and Tiffany Mills at Coldwell Banker Global
   Luxury). She listed it for $12 million in 2013 and then for $15 million
   in 2015, but was unsuccessful in selling it both times.

Sofia Vergara’s Los Angeles Condo Is Available to Rent for $10,200 a Month

The Modern Family star bought the unit for $1.1 million back in 2007 and has
since renovated the space


    Joyce Chen

   September 23, 2019 5:15 PM

   Sofia Vergara’s stylish Los Angeles condo is currently on the rental
   market. The Modern Family star bought the luxury unit, which spans
   2,071 square feet and includes three bedrooms and three bathrooms, back
   in 2007 for $1.1 million, but she’s since upgraded her digs, purchasing
   a $10.6 million home in Beverly Hills in 2014. Vergara is currently
   seeking a renter for the condo, and is asking for $10,200 per month, a
   substantial bump up from the $7,200 a month she asked for when she
   rented it out back in 2015.

   According to a listing for the abode, the unit has been completely
   redone with high-end finishes over the last few years. The home opens
   onto a light-filled, window-lined space with separate living and dining
   areas, plus an upgraded galley kitchen with sleek, modern appliances.
   Dark, finished wood floors throughout stand in stark contrast to the
   white walls and cabinetry, and help to elevate the home’s aesthetic
   appeal.

   The master suite is a highlight of the home, with an impressive marble
   bathroom featuring an oversized deep-soaking tub and a separate
   glass-enclosed steam shower, a cavernous walk-in closet, and a unique
   three-way mirror. Building amenities include everything from 24-hour
   security to valet parking to an exercise room, a pool, and a sauna.

7 Celebrities to Follow on Instagram for Design Inspiration

From the obvious (like Martha Stewart) to the unexpected (Seth Rogen?)


    Rachel Wallace

   September 23, 2019 12:16 PM

   Architectural Digest has had the pleasure of peeking inside some of the
   most stylish homes in the world—many with famous owners. But just
   because a celebrity has amazing taste in decor or art does not
   necessarily mean they choose to show it off on Instagram. Some use
   their pages primarily for promoting their work; some are all about
   selfies; some share 365 outfits of the day per year; others entertain
   their followers with adorable pictures of their children.

   So while an art and architecture buff might be a fan of a particular
   actorʼs movies or a musicianʼs songs, following them on social media
   may not yield much mood-board inspiration. Thatʼs why AD rounded up the
   celebrities who not only share our passions but share our passions on
   their Instagram pages enough to warrant a follow. Herewith, the stars
   who have an admirable penchant for art, architecture, design,
   interiors, and gardening.

   Karlie Kloss

   Everyone knows Kloss is a supermodel turned coder, but her Instagram
   makes it clear that she is also a world traveler who loves a cityscape.
   (Or an ocean view. Or a mountain scene, as evidenced by the many images
   she shared from her Wyoming wedding.) It is unclear exactly where Kloss
   and her husband, Joshua Kushner, currently reside, but at one time,
   they were New Yorkers, and sheʼs used the Big Apple as a backdrop in
   quite a few posts. Sheʼs also shared powerful images of herself posing
   against the skylines of Detroit, Shanghai, and Paris...

   ...and on jaunts to such picturesque sites as Fogo Island, Canada,
   Marrakech, Morocco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the
   super-modern Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California.

   Seth Rogen

   This may come as a surprise, but the funnyman famous for flicks like
   Pineapple Express, Superbad, and Sausage Party dedicates most of his
   page to posting his own handmade pottery and his collection of unique
   vintage ashtrays. Some of his rare finds include monogrammed Louis
   Vuitton and Gucci vessels, plus a midcentury one that doubles as a
   magazine rack—which he uses to hold a copy of AD.

   His love of design doesnʼt stop at smoking paraphernalia and vases,
   however. In November 2018, he shared pictures from a trip to
   Pennsylvania which included stops at Frank Lloyd Wrightʼs Fallingwater
   and the Mattress Factory Museum in Pittsburgh.

   Brooke Shields

   The supermodel resides in a gorgeous historic townhouse in New York
   Cityʼs Greenwich Village, which she and her husband restored and had
   decorated by David Flint Wood. AD toured the place in 2012, but in
   2019, Shields is still regularly showing it off, staging her photos
   with her chic furnishings visible in the background.

   She keeps up her penchant for posing with the decor when sheʼs
   traveling as well. This summer, for example, she served a fierce look
   in front of a fancy armoire while in London.

   Celine Dion

   Great minds think alike. Just like Shields, Dion almost never posts a
   simple selfie showing only her face. The diva is amazing at using
   whatever is around her—be it voluminous drapes, marble floors, or a
   chic settee—to jazz up her pictures.

   Martha Stewart

   Thereʼs the carefully curated brand page @marthastewart, and then there
   is @marthastewart48, the personal handle of the lifestyle maven
   herself. Here, things are equally tasteful, but a bit more casual and
   fun. She shares all of the things youʼd expect from Martha Stewart,
   like fresh-cut flowers, tablescapes, and recipes, and it is fascinating
   to see just how much she actually walks the walk. For example, not only
   did she share an antique lobster mold that she purchased in Maine this
   summer, but she later shared an update about how she actually used it
   to create a quirky and colorful dessert.

   Her garden is another highlight, and she often shares tips and tricks,
   plus snapshots of her thriving plants and many pets.

   Virgil Abloh

   The fashion world is where Abloh reigns supreme, but he’s also a fine
   artist, and he regularly shares his highly structural works on his
   page.

   And even when Abloh posts something related to his work as the artistic
   director of Louis Vuitton menswear, there’s a good chance architecture
   could be involved, like when the brand created a chic New York City
   pop-up shop this summer.

   Diane Keaton

   If there’s one thing all aesthetes can appreciate, it’s a cohesive
   visual story, and that’s what the House That Pinterest Built author and
   queen of black-and-white provides to her followers. Her feed is full of
   monochromatic rooms, general inspiration, and a healthy dose of quirk.
