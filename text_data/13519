The Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens

   This Mediterranean-style residence and studio of internationally known
   Czech-American sculptor, Albin Polasek, features classical busts,
   decorative works, and grand sculptures displayed in several rooms and
   in the sculpture gardens. The historic home, chapel, gardens, and
   temporary exhibition gallery are open to the public. Our story,
   although it is Albin Polasek’s story, resonates with every visitor on
   an intimate level. It is one of perseverance, determination, passion
   and the American Dream. Our mission is to enrich lives by sharing our
   story, our setting and our art.

The Couse-Sharp Historic Site in Taos, New Mexico

   The Couse-Sharp Historic Site, where the two artists once lived and
   created art for the ages, will unveil Sharp’s newly renovated studio
   this June. For devotees of Southwestern art — along with Taos as its
   wellspring — this will be an extraordinary addition and an intimate
   look inside a long-gone era.

Grace Hudson Museum & Sun House

   This art, history, and anthropology complex interprets the lives of
   nationally known artist Grace Carpenter Hudson and her ethnologist
   husband, Dr. John W. Hudson, who both documented the lives of the Pomo
   peoples. Their Craftsman bungalow and studio, which they named Sun
   House, is an example of artistic living.

Olana State Historic Site

   Olana is a 250-acre artist-designed landscape with a Persian-inspired
   house at its summit, embracing unrivaled panoramic views of the vast
   Hudson River Valley. The eminent Hudson River School painter Frederic

Burchfield Homestead Society

   Between the ages of 5 to 28 (1898-1921), Charles Burchfield lived in
   this house with his widowed mother and five siblings. Here he
   originated his distinctive watercolor style that seems to visualize the
   vibrations of nature.

N. C. Wyeth House and Studio, Brandywine River Museum of Art

   N. C. Wyeth spent much of his life and career here as one of the most
   successful illustrators of the first half of the 20th century.
   Experience the studio where Wyeth created many of his memorable works
   of art, and the home where he and his wife Carolyn raised their
   extraordinarily creative children. The dramatic space in which Wyeth
   worked reflects the robust, outsized personality that shaped his art.
   Standing in the main studio, one can easily imagine the great
   illustrator at work, creating characters that would become icons for
   generations of readers.

Thomas Cole National Historic Site

   This is the place where American art was born. Landscape painter Thomas
   Cole originated America’s first major art movement, now known as the
   Hudson River School, which sparked a new appreciation for the beauty of
   America’s landscapes. His groundbreaking achievements took place here
   at Cedar Grove, his home and studio.

Artists at Leisure

   In this series of images, artists take time to relax.

John F. Peto Studio Museum

   This is the home and studio of John Frederick Peto, the nineteenth
   century still–life painter and master of the trompe l’oeil style.
   Following a multi-year preservation project completed in 2011, the
   Peto-designed house, studio, and gardens are now presented as they
   looked during his lifetime. Visitors can compare the very furniture and
   artifacts that Peto owned with the paintings and photographs in which
   they appear.

Roger Brown Study Collection, School of the Art Institute of Chicago

   Roger Brown’s extensive collection of art––a mélange of objects from
   many cultures and genres––is preserved as an artists’ museum in an
   1880s storefront building, modified by Brown into a studio,
   residence/collection, and garden, reflecting his aesthetic and suiting
   the needs of this late 20th century artist. Like stepping into the
   artist’s mind, the RBSC is a kaleidoscopic experience of objects
   arranged by Brown into a visual gesamtkunstwerk.

Don’t Miss This Season of Exhibitions at Historic Artists’ Homes and Studios
