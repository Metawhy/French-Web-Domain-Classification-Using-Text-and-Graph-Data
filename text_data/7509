Medical Science Misrepresented by Idaho Abortion Bill

   Date: March 20th, 2018
   Agency: ID, State
   Explanation: Bias and Misrepresentation

   On March 20, 2018, Idaho Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter (R) signed into
   law SB 1243 which would force doctors to tell patients seeking
   medication abortions that the procedure can be reversed. However,
   professionals at leading medical groups such as the American Medical
   Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
   (ACOG), and Planned Parenthood oppose this experimental course of
   treatment.

   According to the ACOG, “claims regarding abortion ‘reversal’ treatment
   are not based on science and do not meet clinical standards. The [ACOG]
   ranks its recommendations on the strength of the evidence, and does not
   support prescribing progesterone to stop a medical abortion.”

Comments and Legal Briefs

   The Sabin Center frequently engages with federal, state and local
   agencies by submitting comment letters urging decision-makers to
   account for the causes and effects of climate change when deciding
   whether and how to proceed with proposed regulations, guidance
   documents, and projects undergoing environmental reviews.  On some
   occasions, we also engage directly with courts by submitting
   amicus briefs in cases involving climate change law and policy.

Legal Briefs and Submissions

Local Government Amicus Brief in City of Oakland v. BP by Michael Burger
(March 2019)

   The Sabin Center filed an amicus brief on behalf of a local government
   coalition in support of Oakland and San Francisco’s demands that oil
   and gas companies mitigate the harm caused by rising sea levels,
   increasingly frequent and severe storms, and other climate impacts in
   their cities. The coalition members include the U.S. Conference of
   Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the International Municipal
   Lawyers Association.

Local Government Amicus Brief in California v. EPA by Michael Burger and
Jessica Wentz, and related Press Release (February 2019)

   The Sabin Center filed an amicus brief on behalf of a local government
   coalition in the lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s revised
   determination that the GHG and fuel economy standards for light-duty
   vehicles are too stringent and should be weakened. The brief highlights
   the importance of the standards to cities and counties across the
   country and provides a local government perspective on why EPA’s
   decision is unlawful. The coalition members include the U.S. Conference
   of Mayors (USCM), the National League of Cities (NLC), and sixteen
   individual cities and counties that are home to more than 22 million
   people.

   Conference of Mayors, and the International Municipal Lawyers

   submitted an amicus brief on behalf of a local government coalition in
   New York City’s lawsuit against fossil fuel companies seeking

Joint Summary of the Amicus Curiae In Re: National Inquiry on the Impact of
Climate Change on the Human Rights of the Filipino People , related Press
Release (March 2018)

   This brief consolidates and summarizes the key messages and arguments
   contained in the amicus curiae briefs submitted by legal scholars,
   experts, and human rights practitioners  in support of the petitioners
   in the Philippines carbon majors case. Michael Burger and Jessica Wentz

Complaint Challenging Scott Pruitt’s Science Advisory Committee Directive,
Columbia Environmental Law Clinic and Earth Justice, related Press Release
(December 2017)

   In this case, executive director Michael Burger is working with
   Columbia Environmental Law Clinic as a volunteer attorney to represent
   independent scientists Robyn Wilson and Joseph Arvai. This lawsuit
   challenges Scott Pruitt’s directive barring highly qualified,
   independent scientists from EPA’s science advisory boards.

Amicus Brief on Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies, Michael Burger and
Jessica Wentz, and related Press Release (December 2016)

   This amicus brief was written on behalf of eleven carbon capture and
   storage (“CCS”) experts in support of EPA’s emission standard for new
   coal-fired power plants. The standard is based on the CO2 emission
   reductions that can be achieved through the implementation of partial
   CCS, and one of the central issues in the case is whether CCS
   technologies are adequately demonstrated and available for installation
   at coal-fired power plants. The brief contains ample evidence
   corroborating EPA’s determination that these technologies are an
   adequately demonstrated system of emissions reduction for new
   coal-fired power plants.

Submission to Philippines Carbon Majors Investigation by Michael Burger and
Jessica Wentz (December 2016)

   This is a submission to the Philippines Commission on Human Rights in
   support of a petition submitted by Greenpeace Southeast Asia and the
   Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement requesting an investigation
   into the responsibility of the “Carbon Majors” for human rights
   violations resulting from the impacts of climate change. The submission
   outlines the various ways in which climate change interferes with the
   enjoyment of human rights in the Philippines and around the world, and
   explains why the private companies can and should be held accountable
   for human rights violations arising from their contribution to climate
   change.

Clean Power Plan Amicus Brief by Michael Burger and Justin Gundlach, and
related Press Release (April 2016)

     signed an amicus brief explaining why the U.S. Environmental
     Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan is critical to the safety and
     economic security of local communities across the United States. The
     brief was authored by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at
     Columbia Law School.
