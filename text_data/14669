Easy 10-Minute Salmon Kale Salad

   Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday. I’ve been sharing my super easy kale &
   salmon salad recipe on my Instagram Stories and got a lot of questions

Preventing Oily AF Hair & Going 3+ Days Without Washing Your Hair

   Hi friends!!! Remember like… 1+ year ago when I was talking about how I
   had the magical solution for fixing oily hair? I had asked my followers
   for their tips for helping with oily hair and spent a couple months

Phoenix’s New Media Outlet: The Upper Middle’s Launch Party

   This past weekend I attended the official launch party of The Upper
   Middle! They’re a brand new community news site that aims to connect
   the upper middle neighborhoods of Phoenix. They hosted a party to
   celebrate the launch of their new website the Hula’s Modern Tiki
   Phoenix location and had free food, drinks, a balloon animal artist,
   and photographers there to take pictures. It was cool to mix & mingle
   with the community and learn a bit more about what The Upper Middle has

Favorite Places To Eat & Drink in Scottsdale & Phoenix

#InternationalWomensDay: Girl Bosses I Admire & Respect

   Happy #InternationalWomensDay!!!!! The older I get the more respect I
   have for this holiday. Being one of three daughters, I grew up with
   quite a bit of that feminist energy, and now that I’m a business owner
   I have even more respect for the women I know who are out there killing
   it in their fields. I wanted to use today to honor the women – who I’ve
   worked with, who I’ve admired from afar, who I’ve competed against, who
   I’ve simply grabbed coffee with, and…

Preventing Oily AF Hair & Going 3+ Days Without Washing Your Hair

   Hi friends!!! Remember like… 1+ year ago when I was talking about how I

Phoenix’s New Media Outlet: The Upper Middle’s Launch Party

   This past weekend I attended the official launch party of The Upper
   Middle! They’re a brand new community news site that aims to connect
   the upper middle neighborhoods of Phoenix. They hosted a party to

   Phoenix location and had free food, drinks, a balloon animal artist,
   and photographers there to take pictures. It was cool to mix & mingle
   with the community and learn a bit more about what The Upper Middle has

Favorite Places To Eat & Drink in Scottsdale & Phoenix

#InternationalWomensDay: Girl Bosses I Admire & Respect

   Happy #InternationalWomensDay!!!!! The older I get the more respect I
   have for this holiday. Being one of three daughters, I grew up with
   quite a bit of that feminist energy, and now that I’m a business owner
   I have even more respect for the women I know who are out there killing
   it in their fields. I wanted to use today to honor the women – who I’ve
   worked with, who I’ve admired from afar, who I’ve competed against, who
   I’ve simply grabbed coffee with, and…

Phoenix’s New Media Outlet: The Upper Middle’s Launch Party
