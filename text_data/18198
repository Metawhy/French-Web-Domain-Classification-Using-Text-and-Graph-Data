U.S. Tornado Climatology

   Map of the average annual number of tornadoes for each state in the
   United States

   Monthly Tornado Occurrence Maps

   Because a tornado is part of a severe convective storm, and these
   storms occur all over the Earth, tornadoes are not limited to any
   specific geographic location. In fact, tornadoes have been documented
   in every state of the United States, and on every continent, with the
   exception of Antarctica (even there, a tornado occurrence is not
   impossible). In fact, wherever the atmospheric conditions are exactly
   right, the occurrence of a tornadic storm is possible. See NOAA's
   National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Severe Weather 101 information
   for more on the conditions necessary for tornado formation.

   However, some parts of the world are much more prone to tornadoes than
   others. Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North
   or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis.
   This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer,
   subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the
   collision boundaries. In addition, air in the midlatitudes often flows
   at different speeds and directions at different levels of the
   troposphere, facilitating the development of rotation within a storm
   cell. Interestingly, the places that receive the most frequent
   tornadoes are also considered the most fertile agricultural zones of
   the world. This is due in part to the high number of convective storms
   delivering needed precipitation to these areas. Simply because of the
   large number of convective storms and the favorable environment, the
   odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes.

   In terms of absolute tornado counts, the United States leads the list,
   with an average of over 1,000 tornadoes recorded each year. Canada is a
   distant second, with around 100 per year. Other locations that
   experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe,
   western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South
   Africa, and Argentina. In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes,
   relative to its land area, than any other country. Fortunately, most UK
   tornadoes are relatively weak.
     * Recent Tornado Reports and Information
       A summary of recent tornadic activity in the contiguous United
       States, including monthly tornado counts and descriptions of
       significant events.
     * Historical Records and Trends
       Historical records and trends for tornadoes, including graphs and
       maps showing timing and occurrences over approximately 60 years.
     * Tornado Alley
       In the United States, there are two regions with a
       disproportionately high frequency of tornadoes.
     * Deadliest Tornadoes
       Most tornadoes do not result in death. As a result of improved
       forecasting and early warning systems, the death toll has dropped.
