   Original Shirt
   I created this shirt two years ago and I though it would be fun to
   re-create it with a 4th of July Twist.
   I am trying to go back and create Videos for all of my easy no sew tee
   shirts.  This Tee shirt just takes a few minutes and is ridiculously
   easy.
      It's amazing how many designs I can get out of one simple tee shirt.
    Happy 4th Everyone! I hope your day is spent having fun with your
   Family and Friends
   XXOOO

Palm Leaf Halter: DIY Repost

   [Palm%2BLeaf%2Bshirt-3-3.png]
   [palmshirt2-1-655-1.jpg]
   Ideas about how to recreate a t-shirt are constantly haunting me.
   I have so many thoughts about t-shirt it's a little crazy.
   Why do I always go back to using t-shirts?
   Well,  who doesn't  have a t-shirt lying around,
   and if you don't have one they only cost $5.00.
   Here is a quick way to spruce up a plain old white t-shirt.
   Oh.. and I am also a little obsessed with Palm leaves at the moment.

   This is a super easy summer halter you can make in about 5 minutes.
   I hope this helps.

   I love a simple T-shirt dress.
   This dress is made from a XXL Tall Men's Tee
   and requires no sewing.
    Wear it as a beach cover up, or just a simple little dress that you
   could wear
    with some cute Converses or a pointy flat.
   I made a quick video for it
   HERE
   Want to know how easy ?
   Written instructions are below.

Multi-Tied, Side Tee: DIY

   [Side%2Btied%2Btee1-650.png]
    I was in the middle of working on a different project when I had
   someone ask me about another  shirt I had made a year ago and they
   could not find a tutorial on it. When I  went to look for the tutorial
   for them  I realized that I had not made one. What the heck ...
   Then I realized It was Right when my Grandmother had passed away and I
   am sure my mind was a little crazy at the time. I really  wanted to
   post a tutorial on it  so I  quickly re-made the shirt. and wrote up
   this tutorial
    This shirt would be really cute with jeans or shorts or even paired
   with a cute skirt.
   The best thing about this shirt is it is completely adjustable. You can
   make it as tight or as loose as you want.
   Video HERE
   So sorry it took me a year to accomplish this :/
   Love to you all.

Grey CrissCross, Cutout Shirt; DIY

   [greycutout14-650.png]
   [greycutout11-650.png]
   Summer is Coming and Tee Shirts will be a staple in our summer
   wardrobe. One of my favorite things to do is re-design  simple tees to
   spice them up and make them fun to wear. This Design was a request from
   my beautiful 2nd cousin.  This Criss-Cross Cutout may look  difficult
   but it is really easy. My only suggestion  would  be to buy  a small
   sharp pair of scissors.
    I hope All of you are doing well, I am  sending out my love and
   prayers to anyone struggling, or just needing a hug. Life can be so
   hard sometimes, but you are strong and you can pull through. Reach out
   to friends and family, they are there for you and they love you and so
   do I.
   XXOO

Easy Pocket Pies,101.

   [tart44-650.png]
    I have been so obsessed with these little pocket pies.    Pack them in
   lunches , eat them for a quick snack after school, or why not wrap some
   up and give them as a gift. I mean it's pie, who doesn't like pie?
   Fun Fact:
   1900s  – Legendary glutton and a ladies man, James Buchanan Brady
   (1856–1917), known as Diamond Jim Brady, loved pies of various types. A
   special dinner was arranged by architect Stanford White. A huge pie was
   wheeled in, a dancer emerged, naked, and walked the length of the
   banquet table, stopping at Brady’s seat and fell into his lap. As she
   fed the millionaire, more dancers appeared. Brady was well known to
   finish lunch with an array of several kinds of fruit pies
    Well Now, Interesting Huh?
   Want to make your very own Pocket Pie? Here is how.
