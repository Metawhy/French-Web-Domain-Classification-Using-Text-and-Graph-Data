ONE EACH: Still Lifes by Pissarro, Cézanne, Manet & Friends

   With its solemnity and spontaneity, Camille Pissarro’s Still Life of
   1867 is one of the most rewarding and mesmerizing compositions in the
   collection of the Toledo Museum of Art. ONE EACH: Still Lifes by
   Pissarro, Cézanne, Manet & Friends is a one-gallery focus exhibition
   that places this masterpiece in context. The exhibition will feature
   still lifes by French painters, all created in a single decade—the
   1860s. Included are sterling examples from the hand of Édouard Manet,
   regarded as the ‘father of modern painting’, and Paul Cézanne,
   considered to have been the driving precursor of Cubism, the early
   20th-century’s major art movement. Rounding out the group are superb
   paintings by, Claude Monet, Henri Fantin-Latour, and Gustave
   Courbet.ONE EACH: Still Lifes by Pissarro, Cézanne, Manet & Friends is
   sponsored by the Ohio Arts Council with additional support from
   Exhibition Program Sponsor ProMedica.

   Pakistani-American artist Anila Quayyum Agha that create awe-inspiring

“Everything Is Rhythm”: Mid-Century Art & Music

   Following on the success of Sights & Sounds: Art, Nature, and the
   Senses (July 21, 2018-Feb. 23, 2020), the next installation of the New
   Media gallery will once again feature a multisensory display, this time
   focused on an exploration of the relationship between art and music.
   Jointly curated by Halona Norton-Westbrook, Director of Curatorial
   Affairs, and Scott Boberg, Manager of Programs and Audience Engagement,
   the exhibition will feature a selection of 20th-century abstract
   paintings each paired with carefully curated musical composition.
   Presented together in this manner, the art and music engage visitors in
   a multi-sensory experience that simultaneously engenders close looking,
   contemplation, and a consideration of the connection between visual and
   auditory art forms. Free admission.
