Computer Science
without a computer

   CS Unplugged is a collection of free teaching material that teaches
   Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards,
   string, crayons and lots of running around.

   Welcome to the new CS Unplugged!

   This updated website has unit plans, lesson plans, teaching videos,
   curriculum integration activities, and programming exercises to plug in
   the Computer Science concepts they have just learnt unplugged.

   The original activities are still available at classic.csunplugged.org.

   Field Guide.

   The primary goal of the Unplugged project is to promote Computer
   Science (and computing in general) to young people as an interesting,
   engaging, and intellectually stimulating discipline.
