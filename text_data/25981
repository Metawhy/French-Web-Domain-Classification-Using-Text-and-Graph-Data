Playful Penguins!

   Hi there Stampers!
   Well, it happened! We got our first snow yesterday, September 29th.
   That's a tad earlier than usual but not completely shocking. It's still
   trying to spit a little more snow today but the rest of the week is
   supposed to be a balmy 50 degrees!  In the meantime, I was searching
   for hats, gloves, and scarves!
   Speaking of such, have you seen the "Playful Penguins" stamp set and
   their cute winter accessories? They are some super cute sketched
   penguins in this stamp set, a really nice hand scripted font for the
   sentiments and some warm winter accessories for that cold wind and
   snow. I had fun playing with this set and want to share some simple
   stamping ideas with you!  This set is a real winner if you are new to
   stamping and don't have a lot of ink colors and also don't own a die
   cutting machine. There are no coordinating dies!  Here we go:
   [fullsizeoutput_23a3.jpeg]
   This first card stuck with a couple of shades of blue, Blueberry Bushel
   and Balmy Blue, as well as Basic Gray for my penguins. I did fussy cut
   the scarf, bow tie and stocking cap. I love that  the penguins look
   friendly and real but not cartoonish.
   [fullsizeoutput_23a2.jpeg]
   For this second card, I used a few more tools including the "Softly
   Falling" embossing folder   (#139672 now on the Clearance Rack for
   $5!!), a retired snowflake trinket and the adorable felt hat and scarf
   from the "Let It Snow" Embellishment Kit. These felt accessories were
   designed for the snowman punch, but they work on the penguins as well!
   By the way, I did do all my stamping BEFORE I embossed my Whisper White
   cardstock with the Softly Falling embossing folder.
   [fullsizeoutput_23a1.jpeg]
   I decided to make at least one Holiday Card with the penguin set.  I
   grabbed some Designer Series Paper from the new "Most Wonderful Time"
   product medley. There are lots of stamps, dies, die cuts, sequins and
   more to play with in this product line. Stampin' Up! has gathered up
   coordinating products and put them together in a medley for you to buy
   and do what you want with them! I did fussy cut the penguin and also
   used some Sparkle glimmer paper to create the illusion of snow.
   I hope you've enjoyed seeing some fun penguins and thinking about what
   you would do with these stamps. Just for fun, I want to share a couple
   photos I took of real live penguins at the Cincinnati Zoo, back in
   February, when I was visiting there. They are fascinating creatures to
   watch, especially their distinctive waddle!
   [%2525EKWunzOSUSvPz%252B0kMzQQw.jpg]
   [2Xfr22pORRWsFNdMbmExoA.jpg]
   Well, that's it for today!  I'm heading back to the stamp room to see
   what other fun I can come up with! Hope you are finding some time to be
   creative as well!
   Happy Stampin'!

Band Together Bundle

   Hello Stampers!
   Happy Friday!  We are having some gorgeous sun this morning which is a
   prelude to a forecast of intense winter storm coming this weekend with
   up to 2" of snow in some elevations.  Yes, I know it isn't even October
   but it's also Montana and Montana can do whatever it pleases in the
   weather department. We have wide open prairie spaces and majestic
   mountain spaces and all of it combines for some crazy weather.  I'm
   going to ignore the predicted snow for now and dwell on something much
   more springy - flowers!
   Have you seen the "Band Together" bundle in the Annual Catalog on page
   121?  It's a charming set with some great sentiments and a fabulous
   flower to color. The dies are unique in that they include some
   sentiment dies as well as ways to make belly bands for your cards or
   more ornate background pieces. Confused?  What's a belly band anyway?
   It's like a belt!  Keeps the whole thing together and in place!  Here
   are some designs I came up with while playing with this set.
   [fullsizeoutput_23ec.jpeg]
   I tried a lot of things with this card. First, I stamped the large
   flower stem in Tuxedo Black Momento Ink. I then colored it with a
   combination of Flirty Flamingo and Petal Pink Stampin' Blends. These
   were easy colors to blend together. I stamped my sentiment and cut it
   out with one of the dies, then cut the Flirty Flamingo frame with
   another die and then cut the belly band part with a third die.
   [fullsizeoutput_23ed.jpeg]
   Here's a picture of the same card only with the belly band removed. You
   want the band to be snug but not so tight that you can't slide it on
   and off the card. Oh, one other thing I did after coloring my base
   layer. I grabbed the Subtle 3D embossing folder and embossed it to give
   it a textured, woven look.  I love the Subtle folder and it is an
   absolute "must have" for your stash of folders.
   Here are a few other ideas:
   [fullsizeoutput_23eb.jpeg]
   For this card, I again used Stampin' Blends to color my flowers, leaves
   and the background of my card stock. This gave me a mottled background
   look. I wouldn't do this very often because it takes quite a bit of ink
   from the Stampin' Blend marker!  this time, I created a side fitting
   belly band as well.
   [fullsizeoutput_23ea.jpeg]
   One of the band dies in the set is quite narrow so I thought I could
   probably do several of them, different colors, stacked on top of each
   other. I'm always looking for ways to show off the In-Colors and this
   was the perfect number of bands I needed. I just glued these on flat on
   my card and love the look. This card looked great without a sentiment
   but I added a Happy Birthday while I was at it.
   It's fun to think a little outside the box and create projects by using
   products in alternate ways, like the last card.  We have so many
   choices for dies, stamps, paper and more. It can be overwhelming but
   once you go to our online store, you'll see some easy shopping
   categories to explore and you can always contact me if you can't find
   what you're looking for or have any other questions. I'm here to help!
   Supply information is listed below!
   I hope you have a beautiful weekend, whether you're stunned by the
   first blizzard of the year or enjoying a gorgeous autumn somewhere
   besides Montana!  I report back on Monday and let you know if the snow
   actually showed up!
   Happy Stampin'!
   Sarah

Welcome to the Team!

   Hi Stampers!
   I'm enjoying getting back to my blog and sorting through some pictures
   of cards that I've taken but not featured yet for you to see. I'm
   taking a brief break from the Holiday Catalog to showcase some Annual
   Catalog sets that you may have been curious about. The set I'm sharing
   today is a wonderful idea for any of you who work and like to make
   cards for co-workers.  It's not just about birthdays, but sometimes
   there is a "welcome" or a "goodbye" that needs to be said as well as a
   "congratulations" or "just because".  This set covers all the ideas and
   features a coffee cup and work chair as the perfect symbols of so many
   jobs!  Here are some fun ideas I created recently:
   [fullsizeoutput_23e5.jpeg]
   This first card features the iconic desk chair that so many people
   spend so much of their life in!  I chose to stamp it in Tuxedo Black
   Momento and then color with my Stampin' Blends.  Can you guess where I
   got that background paper from?  If you are having a hard time placing
   it, I wouldn't be surprised. Believe it or not, it's one of the sheets
   from the "Come Sail Away" Designer Series Paper!  It has just about
   nothing to do with sailing but makes an awesome background in a
   little-used color - black!
   [fullsizeoutput_23e4.jpeg]
   My next card features one of my favorite sentiments of the stamp set,
   addressing the crazy it takes to perform some jobs!  Of course, it
   could be in jest, or serious! This card is fairly monochromatic,
   featuring Terracotta Tile, a new In-Color this year. I used the
   embossing folder and Designer Series Paper from the Mosaic Mood suite
   of products. My coffee mug die is from the "Cup of Cheer" set in the
   2019 Holiday Catalog!
   [fullsizeoutput_23e6.jpeg]
   And, of course, the coffee cup!  This was fun to stamp with Early
   Espresso Ink and then lightly color with the light Pool Party Stampin'
   Blend marker. My Designer Series Paper choices harken back to a year
   ago or two when we had a hold suite of products with a coffee theme.
   So, if you are part of a team at work, an office mate, etc., consider
   purchasing this set to make cards for all the work people!  They can be
   any style or color scheme making it such a versatile set!
   I have lots of fun things on my Stampin'Up! radar this fall. I plan to
   hold several classes in October as well as get going on more videos. I
   know for those of you who can't come to a class, seeing a "how to"
   video is so helpful!  October 1st is the start of a new Stampin'Up!
   year and so I'm setting some goals. You can help me!  What would you
   like to see me do more of?  More blogging, more videos, more classes,
   more info about promotions?  What's your preferred way to connect with
   me on Social Media? ~ My blog, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram?  Would a
   monthly Newsletter be helpful?  I am open to all the possibilities and
   would love to hear your comments!  You can comment here or on any other
   platform and I will take it to heart!  Thanks so much for your help!
   Happy Stampin'!

Wiggle Worm!

   Hi Stampers!
   Wow, I can't believe it's been a couple of weeks since I've blogged.
   It's one of my favorite activities but alas, real life and its
   challenges have taken my time and energy.  It's good to be back to a
   happy place for me. Thank you so much for subscribing or checking in on
   my posts to see what is new and what I'm up to.
   We are well into fall now and the end of summer. I am assuming most of
   the insects and bugs are also gone or at least hibernating or whatever
   they do once it gets cold.  The set I want to share today wasn't one
   that attracted my attention at first, but then I decided it was really
   cute and worth some love!  It's called "Wiggle Worm" and comes with a
   great stamp and die bundle. I recently spent some time playing and
   wanted to share some fun ideas.
   [fullsizeoutput_23e8.jpeg]
   For this card, I wanted to feature some unique dies that come in the
   bundle but are not part of the stamp designs. The big leaves and the
   grass are awesome!  I am excited to play more with the grass and
   combine it with other sets.  I felt this sentiment was perfect for a
   young person in your life, like a sweet grandchild!
   [fullsizeoutput_23e7.jpeg]
   Of course, I had to use the bee stamps and die when I saw this
   sentiment!  It would be easy to color them, but it was even easier to
   stamp on Daffodil Delight paper and just cut them out with the
   coordinating die. Do you love mushrooms?  I will eat them in almost
   anything except dessert!  The mushrooms are another die that do not
   have a coordinating stamp but they were easy to cut out and add to my
   project.
   [fullsizeoutput_23e9.jpeg]
   I also figured I should try all the bugs and see what happens!  I used
   bright colors and my Stampin'Write markers to give these bugs some
   life. Again, this is perfect for young children!  If you love bugs or
   you just have lots of kids to make cards for, this is a great set with
   a little different theme that will serve you well!  I've listed my
   supplies below and a click on any one of them will take you to my
   online store which features a new format and look. I think it's easier
   than ever to shop online!
   It feels good to be back, chatting with you and sharing my love of
   stamping. I have a son getting married in about 10 days so I can't
   promise I will be here everyday, but I do plan to get back to blogging!
   There is so much to love and stamp, right?!
   Thanks for stopping by!

Snowfront

   Hey Stampers!
   Remember a couple of years ago when a wonderful stamp set called
   "Waterfront" came out?  All of a sudden there were oodles of ideas on
   Pinterest and other sites as people used this set to build wonderfully
   creative scene of mountains, trees, water and more. Well, Stampin'Up!
   has done it again, this time with "Snowfront"! There are still
   mountains and trees but now we have a cabin, some deer and even a
   snowman!  This is such a fun set to play with and let your imagination
   sore as you create many different scenes with paper and ink.  Here are
   some ideas I had:
   [fullsizeoutput_23bf.jpeg]
   This card uses a lot of the stamps and then I cut it with a stitched
   edge rectangle die to give it a framed piece of art appearance. Don't
   you just love the cabin and deer?
   [fullsizeoutput_23be.jpeg]
   This card features a fun technique. You simply do all your stamping and
   then run your piece of stamped cardstock through an embossing folder. I
   chose our new 3D Brick folder!  I think this card looks like a mural on
   the side of a brick wall.
   [fullsizeoutput_23bd.jpeg]
   This last one is a little fancier because I used the snowflake dies
   from the "Christmas Layers" dies. I love our new In Color, Seaside
   Spray and it's perfect for wintery moods.
   If this stamp set isn't already on your wish list, you should add it!
   Any color of inks will work for the components and it is so fun to play
   with!  I'm not exactly wishing for snow yet, but I know it's on its way
   sooner or later. Today I'm off to do some 4-wheeling in the mountains
   so I'll be on the lookout for trees, cabins, deer and hopefully no
   snow!
   Happy Stampin'!

Tidings All Around

   Hi Stampin' Friends!
   Are you a wreath-lover?  All seasons, all types?  I sure am.  I think
   it's such a warm and welcoming addition to a wall or door at any time.
   There are some great new wreath-themed products in the new Holiday
   Catalog that you will really enjoy!  Today I want to share some ideas
   featuring the "Tidings All Around" set. It's a great wreath and branch
   set that also comes with coordinating dies. Here are some of the ideas
   I came up with recently:
   [fullsizeoutput_23aa.jpeg]
   This card shows off the wreath stamp and die. I did use a bow from
   another set ("Free Skate") but the sentiment is from this set. I also
   lighted stamped the new "Wired" background stamp on my Very Vanilla
   background. It is designed to look like chicken wire!
   [fullsizeoutput_23a9.jpeg]
   This card features a new favorite stamp!  It's the three branches and
   it is carved to take different saturations of ink.  I can't figure out
   how they do that, but it is lovely to stamp with. The "Toile Tidings"
   Designer Series Paper is also featured on this card, which is just
   gorgeous. I daubed some Soft Suede ink on my edges to give this card a
   vintage look.
   [fullsizeoutput_23a8.jpeg]
   This card features a separate wreath die cut that doesn't require any
   stamping. You can also see some bare branches and I used red
   rhinestones for some hollyberries.  The Toile Tidings DSP is again
   featured on this card.
   I hope you've got your wish list started from this fun catalog!
   There's lots to love and inspire you.  Keep checking back as I share
   more ideas featuring all new products from Stampin'Up!  My supplies are
   listed below and clicking on any of them will take you to the online
   store.
   Happy Stampin'!

Merry Christmoose!!!

   Happy Friday Stampin' Friends!
   I'll bet anything the last time you went through your craft supplies
   you thought to yourself, "gee, I sure wish Stampin'Up! would come up
   with some more fun punches...."  Hey, guess what! Your wish came true!
   The Holiday Catalog is full of new punches and I'm sharing my favorite
   today, the moose!  It coordinates with a wonderful stamp set as well so
   you can stamp and/or punch all the moose you need for your great ideas.
   I actually live in a place where the moose live too, although you don't
   see them everyday, like deer!  They are gorgeous, graceful and
   absolutely huge creatures. They are also fun to use for crafting.
   Here are some quick ideas for you using my moose punch:
   [fullsizeoutput_23b4.jpeg]
   I actually did use the moose stamp on this card before I punched out
   the moose, but my ink color and paper color were too dark to see it
   well. The trees, boughs and pinecones are part of the set and I used
   one of the "Frosted Frames" dies for my background piece.
   [fullsizeoutput_23b1.jpeg]
   For my second card, I wanted to play with some of the new Plaid
   Designer Series Paper, the tree punch and the moose punch. I did have
   to cut the scarf out by hand ;)
   [fullsizeoutput_23b2.jpeg]
   This card features the moose walking through a quiet morning, snowy
   scene, created by the "Feels Like Frost" 6 x 6" Designer Series Paper.
   This paper is so easy to grab and create something special with.
   [fullsizeoutput_23b3.jpeg]
   Finally, I just had to make a card featuring this cute raccoon!  It's
   part of the stamp set as well and I just love him.  This time I used a
   pine tree from the "Winter Woods" stamp set. I did some shadow stamping
   by inking up the tree stamp once and then stamping three times, in
   different, overlapping places.
   Just in case you have to have a moose punch, I want to show you the
   bundle so you can see the great stamps that go with it. You can buy the
   stamps or punch separately or as a bundle and save 10%.
   [153015G.jpg]
   What a fun way to add some adventure and outdoors to your Christmas
   crafting!  Check these supplies out and all the rest of Stampin'Up!'s
   full line of papercrafting supplies at the online store. Simply click
   on "shop now" and you will be directed to my online store.
   Hope you have a great weekend ahead of you!  We are going to try to do
   some four-wheeling next week and I'll keep you posted if I see any
   moose!
   Happy Stampin',
   Sarah
