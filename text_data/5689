Weddings by boat. The Importance of Lighting

   Today I want to talk about my experience when decorating wedding
   weddings. Some works of which I enjoy a lot since there are not two
   identical boats and where a good dose of creativity works surprising
   spaces and with a lot of impact for the assistants. A wedding, and if
   they are boat weddings, I think even more, it is perhaps one of the
   most special days in a person’s life and therefore, their celebrations
   are organized to leave a mark on both the newlyweds and their guests.

   Every couple that I help to “make” their dream is looking for unique
   ideas and special ways to make their wedding more meaningful. I almost
   always tell you that if you want to do something unique, one of the
   best investments is in the lighting of the boat, very grateful and
   without destroying the budgets we have for our wedding boat.

   The elements that I like the most for wedding boat decoration are paper
   lanterns (which are beautiful during the day and when the sun goes
   down, they are lit, they are hypnotic), LED candles, Casablanca flower
   bouquets, spotlights and furniture with light.

   The light plays an important role in any celebration but in boat
   weddings, it takes on significant importance since, unlike an event on
   land, some elements are not suitable for a boat. Besides, with what
   technology has advanced in this field, with the LEDs, you can change
   the atmosphere of your wedding with the touch of a switch.

   From bold and contemporary setting to soft and romantic; The creative
   use of the lights can help establish the right atmosphere on a wedding
   boat, so much so that even in the simplest decoration, the lights can
   add a magnificent atmosphere or you can create a unique visual appeal
   with the decoration, using the chosen color.

   There are many ways to accentuate wedding boat decoration with
   lighting. It is always preferable to create different spaces. Some
   where the lighting is intimate, where the guests will enjoy moments of
   more relaxation and others with more dynamic lighting that will help
   the party not to decay at any time. If you complement it with a good DJ
   that joins your sound system to the lights, you will create an
   incredible atmosphere. The lighting would be perfect if combined with
   some flowers. If you live in Paris, we recommend you to buy from flower
   shop Paris.

   For couples who want a lighting that adds a personalized motif, they
   can create specific points of light or video-mapping that gives a lot
   of play and is impressive … Both one and the other give a unique and
   fun touch for any wedding and are ideal for holding a boat wedding with
   a selected theme.

   The lights that, rather than directly illuminate, generate a shade of
   light and color, a wonderful luminosity that can even be combined with
   the general color chosen for the decoration of your wedding by boat.

   The furniture with autonomous light is very versatile but yes, I
   recommend that it is always with batteries to avoid the power cables
   that are always a nuisance to camouflage, apart from not having any
   conditions when placing them in the right place.

   With these tips I just want to open your eyes to a part of the
   decoration that in a wedding in a garden of a farm can go unnoticed (I
   would never do it) but that in a boat it can be a differentiating
   element that makes the word happen “ right ”to“ Wow !! ”.

   If you want to know more about how we illuminate boat weddings or have
   any questions about how to organize them, you can ask us. We will
   answer you shortly.

6 Ways to Keep Your Business Network Safe

   When starting up a business, there are many things to consider. These
   can range from hiring the right people, making sure you have all the
   right equipment, and knowing how it’s going to function correctly.

   Something we tend to overlook, however, is the protection behind the
   company’s network. We get so caught up in getting everything up and
   running in the first place that we forget about what comes afterward.

   It’s so crucial that your network is secure to avoid significant data
   breaches and possible viruses making their way in and destroying all
   your work. There are many ways you can protect the network to make it
   as safe as possible.

   6 Ways to Keep Your Business Network Safe

   When starting up a business, there are many things to consider. These
   can range from hiring the right people, making sure you have all the

   Something we tend to overlook, however, is the protection behind the
   company’s network. We get so caught up in getting everything up and
   running in the first place that we forget about what comes afterward.

   It’s so crucial that your network is secure to avoid significant data
   breaches and possible viruses making their way in and destroying all
   your work. There are many ways you can protect the network to make it
   as safe as possible.

   Make your business network safe

Staff Training

   The first thing to do to make sure that you’re working safely is to
   inform your employees and everyone who’s going to be working on the
   network how to manage the regulations you put in place.

   You’ll want to train them on ways to avoid viruses and make sure that
   their laptops are continuously updated with new software and an
   excellent antivirus. If just one of their laptops gets hacked, it could
   be the start of a company disaster.

Constantly Check the Network

   With an IP address scanner, you will be able to see every single
   computer that is working on the same network to monitor what’s going on
   and make sure everything is running well.

   You will also be able to observe when something unusual is occurring
   and stop an outsider from getting in and causing a data breach. This is
   a must for any company and an investment that is really worth it.

Get a VPN

   Another necessity if you want to make sure you are well protected. A
   VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your connection to the internet
   to make sure that it’s secure and provides an exceptional level of
   security to any business.

   The VPN will hide your internet activity from the service provider and
   create a significant barrier between you and hackers or even other
   companies who may be trying to steal information.

   Get a VPN for safe browsing

Disable File Sharing

   This is very important if you don’t want everyone to see your activity.
   Every computer has an option to disable file sharing, and you will want
   to turn it on for everyone. If not, anyone on the same network will see
   what’s going on.

   As long as it’s disabled and you are using the IP network scanner
   often, you won’t have any issues.

Get Servers Audited

   On each of your servers, there are probably a lot more services running
   that are really needed. An audit will be conducted to check which ones
   you actually use and get rid of the others.

   This is a great step to take as it means you are removing services that
   can make your network more vulnerable and visible to others.

   Get your services audited to see what you really need

Set Up a WAF

   A WAF (Web Application Firewall) is an addition to the firewalls that
   should already be on your computers. This is especially important if
   your company sells products over the internet or has customer accounts.

   It works in making sure that all the data from your customers is secure
   and can protect you against remote file intrusion, as well as several
   other security threats.

To Conclude

   A secure and safe network is something every company, big or small,
   should take time to make sure it is in place. The risks posed without
   one are huge and could end up ruining your business or the competition
   stealing your ideas.

   There are even more ways and steps you can take to protect your company
   further. But starting with the aforementioned should get your network
   off to a solid start. You’ll be doing your business and yourself a huge
   favor.

Utilizing Social Media and Online Marketing to Expand Your Business

   Here are the nice tips to use social media and online marketing to grow
   your business with fewer efforts. Operating and managing a successful
   business over an extended period of time requires a commitment and
   dedication to understanding the industry you are in and the type of
   content, products, or services you have to offer to the public as well.
   When you are running your own company and seeking new opportunities to
   expand while potentially increasing your revenue, you have plenty of
   options depending on your marketing and advertising budget. If you want
   to find the most cost-effective method of growing and expanding any
   type of business, putting the internet and social media to use can help
   you grow to the next level with little or no cost of investment at all
   to you.

The Use of Social Media to Expand Your Business

   Incorporating social media with your business is a quick way to gain
   fans, new customers, and to keep in touch with those who are loyal to
   your brand. By taking advantage of free online social networking
   communities and creating virtual hubs and fan pages for your business,
   you can share your logo, message, and constant updates with all of
   those who are interested in following you within the site. You can also
   increase your fan base when you buy Instagram followers. Branding by
   implementing the same logo and colors with all of your social media
   profiles will help to gain recognition from others while also
   increasing your online reputation and credibility.

   With the use of social media, you can also keep an open line of
   communication with your consumers and fans, helping to build customer
   loyalty. By updating consistently with news, new releases, and even
   sales, you show your followers that you care about them and that you
   are not “just another corporate business”. Additionally, you can also
   directly respond to questions and comments within your social media
   pages to provide the support and feedback your visitors are seeking.

   Using social media outlets can be done daily and throughout each day to
   be as active and involved in your followers’ online lives. The more you
   post, the more memorable your business will be, although it is
   important not to appear as “spam” to become blocked or removed if
   others become bothered by your number of posts.

Online Marketing and Advertising to Expand Business

   Another method to grow any type of business online is with the use of
   online advertising and marketing. When you want to advertise on a
   particular website, you can do so by contacting the website owners
   directly–or even by utilizing a 3rd party advertising service. When you
   choose to work with websites directly to advertise, you will often pay
   a premium price based on the current amount of traffic and page views
   the website receives. If you want to use a 3rd party advertising
   service, you can set budget limits and search for relevant keywords and
   types of websites you would like to advertise on. By selecting genres
   and categories to list your website in, you are more likely to receive
   genuine clicks and those who want to know more about the products and
   services you have to offer.

   If you want to expand your online business then you should also check
   to outsmart and solid tips for the same.

Useful Tips to Boost Your Instagram Account

   Instagram is easily the best social media network when you consider
   reach, user engagement, and daily activity. It has millions of active
   users and about 1.6 billion like each day. This is an incredible
   performance by any app. It is said that Instagram will make a great
   impression in the coming days. Making an Instagram account is not
   tough, but boosting your Instagram account takes time and needs serious
   strategies. Some report said that selling a product on Instagram is way
   more than Facebook or any other social networking website. If you
   follow the guidelines properly, you can easily grow your account.

   Useful Tips to Boost Your Instagram Account

   1- Leverage Hashtags

   This is indeed the first and the foremost tip you need to keep in mind
   if you are serious about boosting your IG account. Hashtags are the
   real power of your post. Always use the hashtags related to your post
   and use all the possible hashtags. Always spend some time to choose the
   relevant and important hashtags for your brand. In case of any event or
   match, when people search on Instagram, then Instagram shows them the
   content based on the most relevant hashtags. Therefore, you need to be
   careful in choosing the right hashtags and try to cover everything in
   your hashtags.

   2- Share Selfies to Boost Your Account

   A recent report showed that posting your selfies or the photos that
   have your face in them increases likes up to 33%. You can either use
   photos or videos. Video is the best option to promote your stuff. If
   you are running a brand page on Instagram, try to go online and share
   your views face-to-face with your followers. Your team should hire
   someone who could do this job for you. This activity will significantly
   increase like-minded followers

   3- Post Meaningful Content

   Always make a post related to your brand or niche. Don’t share
   irrelevant stuff; otherwise, you will lose your followers sooner or
   later. This is the best practice to engage your followers and stay in
   the competition. Your caption should reflect your brand, and it must be
   captivating to get more followers. Let me make it clear that you can’t
   post pets video on a fitness account.

   4- Creating Instagram Ads

   Creating Instagram ads is a wise option in boosting your Instagram
   account. All you need to do is to choose the right ads to show to the
   right people. If you use Instagram ads properly, you can significantly
   increase followers and sales of your brand.

   5- Use Instagram Stories

   Using Instagram stories is the best strategy to engage more and more
   users and boost your account. Followers on Instagram regularly check
   the Stories as compared to Facebook. So, always try to post compelling
   stories on Instagram to grab follower’s attention.

   6- Conduct Giveaway Contests

   Comments are the most important when you talk about user engagement on
   Instagram. You can even make your Instagram popular by following the
   Giveaway strategies. Post a giveaway, and more and more people will tag
   their friend to be on this giveaway. You can giveaway a watch, poster,
   or user’s sketch. Anything will be great, but it has astonishing
   effects on your brans.

   Keep in mind

   1- Using irrelevant hashtags will not help your brand.

   2- Irrelevant description or short describe leads to the failure of the
   brand.

   3- Posting time should be evening or night when most of the people are
   live on Instagram.

   4- Getting attached to the already established Instagramers will help
   your brand as well.

   5- Always provide the exact location and who else in this particular
   photograph.

   So, that it. These are the best tips and some of the useful precautions
   when you are on Instagram and want to grow your account. There is a
   huge competition, and you can’t grow your product unless you follow
   these instructions to engage your users as well.

How does RPA work and the different types of RPA

   Robotic Process Automation is growing exponentially across various
   industry segments – manufacturing, healthcare, retail, education and
   customer service. Studies predict that enterprises are looking to
   invest in RPA more so than ever in the next 3 to 5 years. Indisputably,
   RPA will gain a stronger foothold in our everyday lives.

   Despite its rapid growth, enterprises are on the fence about adopting
   RPA, looking at ways to overcome the challenges in adopting and scaling
   RPA across the enterprise. Scalability, intelligence, and security are
   the features that enterprises look for when adopting RPA software.
   Companies such as UiPath, Blue Prism, and EdgeVerve are the top leaders
   or vendors in the automation industry.

   What is Robotic Process Automation?

   Robotic Process Automation (RPA) implements software robots to automate
   repetitive, rule-based processes across an enterprise, relieving humans
   off mundane tedious tasks and allowing them to focus on higher-value
   work. RPA is bringing about a disruptive transformation in the way
   enterprises operate. No doubt, RPA is a dynamic, adaptable tool that
   improves business efficiency, eliminates human errors, and makes
   employees more productive.

   How does RPA work?

   Every enterprise is unique; hence, a one-size-fits-all approach will
   not work. Most back-office processes, from claims processing to
   invoicing, can be automated.
     * Robots work at the UI level interacting with systems/applications
     * Bots can be applied across all applications
     * Automates repetitive, rule-based tasks (e.g. copy-pasting data,
       scraping data, reading databases etc.)

   Tasks that are time-consuming and tedious can be automated, ensuring
   the human worker can be efficient and more involved in decision-making
   processes. The bots follow a precise set of rules, mimicking the human
   worker. Processes that are repetitive, structured, and time-sensitive
   rely on Robotic Process Automation. From identifying tasks to automate
   to deploying a full-scale RPA, enterprises are embracing RPA
   technologies more than ever.

   Types of automation:

   Enterprises go through a journey – from RPA 1.0 to cognitive or
   intelligent automation. There are three types of automation that
   enterprises should look at to traverse the automation journey.

   Attended Automation

   Attended/Assisted automation or desktop automation is where automation
   is done on the desktop with bots performing repetitive, rule-based
   tasks and handing over the decision-making process to humans. Also
   known as Robotic Desktop Automation or RDA, it improves productivity,
   can be deployed quickly and does not require any changes or
   modification to the underlying systems/applications.

   For instance, attended automation can be implemented in contact
   centers, wherein the bots display an alert or error message to the
   employee if the worker commits a mistake.

   Unattended Automation

   Processes that can be automated end-to-end without any human
   intervention is known as unattended/unassisted automation. Usually
   leveraged in tedious back-office processes, the bots here run on
   dedicated infrastructure, servers, or mainframes. The fully automated
   process improves productivity, relieving the human worker off
   monotonous tasks.

   For example, an organization can look at unattended automaton if they
   are looking to automate the massive number of invoices and receipts in
   their finance department.

   Intelligent automation

   Intelligent or cognitive automation uses artificial intelligence
   technologies, including machine learning, semantics, deep learning, and
   natural language processing to make sense of the unstructured data.
   With the help of predictive and prescriptive analysis, intelligent
   automation helps automate tasks that involve decision-making and
   judgement.

   If organizations are looking to stay ahead, creating new experiences
   for their customers, Intelligent Automation is the way to go. Though
   there are several challenges that enterprises may face when deploying
   IA, here are a few benefits how it can help enterprises in their
   digital transformation journey.
     * Helps reduce labor costs
     * Processes complex, large volume of data easily
     * Helps in the decision-making process, thereby achieving accuracy
       and speed
     * Eliminates manual intervention, reducing errors and improving
       productivity
     * Improves customer experience and satisfaction

   Before deploying RPA, enterprises should answer a few questions — Who
   is responsible for implementing an RPA program or strategy? Do we have
   the right skills and talent to deploy RPA? How can we digitize data?

   We can sum up by saying that enterprise-wide integration of RPA
   solutions is the way forward. Since RPA tools do not require
   significant IT changes, it can be deployed on existing technology and
   systems, delivering game-changing benefits across the enterprise. Has
   your organization deployed RPA solutions?
