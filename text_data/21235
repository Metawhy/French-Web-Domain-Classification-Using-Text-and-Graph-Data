   Together, we helped save The Expanse, the critically-acclaimed space
   saga that's been running for three years on Syfy. We look forward to
   watching season four on Amazon!

   This respectful depiction of STEM ideas, when combined with engaging
   story lines and diverse cast of memorable characters, makes this show a
   refreshing standout in the genre in which "hard" sci-fi can sometimes
   be too enigmatic to gain widespread popularity.

   Cas Anvar, who has brilliantly played Alex Kamal on The Expanse, was
   the special guest at our annual Escape Velocity sci-fi convention in
   2017 where he greeted fans and spoke passionately about his role on the
   show. Mr. Anvar described how proud he has been to be a part of this
   kind of project which puts a lot of attention into getting the little
   details right, based on real science, to make the fictional world seem
   more believable.
