SCALING
Rebuilding the digital society with people

   Even if digital is already disrupting our lives in many ways, we ain’t
   seen nothing yet!
   AI, IoT, blockchain and much of the most disruptive digital innovations
   have been seen as game changers along the path that has led to the
   current situation where we have no choice but to make do with digital.
   However, most of them are spread at too low scale today to play their
   expected role of disruptor.

   Digital has become a primary energy source for powering businesses,
   creating new products, launching new services, designing new concepts
   and even improving the way we live and work. With a long-term view, we
   can thus expect it to dramatically shift the paradigms and induce a new
   world order.

   Scaling is the first step, and if it affects companies in the first
   place, the new business models and work organization are deeply
   influencing people and society, while governments have an important
   role to play to help companies and citizens navigate this paradigm
   shift.

   This 41^st DigiWorld Summit will be looking ahead, thinking together
   about what we want tomorrow’s digital world to look like, and what we
   need to start doing today to get there.
