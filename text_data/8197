Teaching the Bible: 7 Days of Creation Introduction

   Posted on July 30, 2014 | Leave a comment

   We‚Äôve finally wrapped up a series on the 7 days of creation and I am
   going to try and organize it into posts.  Let me just say it took us A
   LOT longer than 7 days!  I basically used the creation story to focus
   our learning time.  I never intended to get through it in one week
   since I also used this as the backdrop for a lot of
   academic activities.  I was developing and organizing as I went‚Ä¶ as
   well as dealing with pregnancy, lots of travelling, lazy weeks, and
   distractions‚Ä¶ so I was ok with moving slowly through it all.  You
   could pick and choose activities from the entire series to complete in
   one day, one week or one month depending on what fits your schedule.
   You‚Äôll see that what fit our schedule was spreading it out over months
   (we started last summer and ended in the winter).

   This was not our only Bible lesson during these months.  But it became
   a great backdrop for so many other Bible stories we learned during the
   same time.

   My goal was to teach J about the greatness of God as expressed
   through His creation (or honestly to breach the surface of that topic,
   since the greatness of God simply can‚Äôt be covered in its entirety even
   in a lifetime of learning!).  I also wanted to couple the greatness of
   God with the truth that this same God created, knows, loves, helps, and
   has plans for J too‚Ä¶. a truth that I just find amazing.

   My current plan is one Creation post each week, so I should be
   finished 7 weeks from today.  We‚Äôll see how long each post becomes.  I
   might have to split some up to simplify things a bit.  I used crafts,
   games, discussions, memory verses, books, and whatever came to mind
   that would work for each day of creation.

   I hope you enjoy and find some of it useful!

Letter Puzzles (and on sale!)

   Posted on March 16, 2012 | 6 comments

   I was just doing some birthday shopping and noticed a sale on one of
   our favorite learning tools.  I thought I‚Äôd hop on here to share real
   quick.

   Nab It I came across Nab-It in the store about a year ago and it has
   been such a valuable tool.  It is actually a game but I honestly have
   not even read the instructions and haven‚Äôt yet played the game as
   intended. I‚Äôll get around to learning that soon hopefully.  We‚Äôre
   having enough fun with the pieces right now.

   The game consists of 4 sets of letter puzzles, each a different color
   and each in their own drawstring bag. Each puzzle piece has a letter
   on both sides. Your little one will get used to looking on both sides
   for the desired letter. We have used them to practice the alphabet,
   spelling words, word families, and blends.

   Amazon has Nab-It for sale right now.  If you‚Äôre in the market for a
   fun preschool tool that will double as a fun game when your little one
   is older, this would be great!

Shaving Cream Landforms and more

   Posted on February 27, 2012 | 3 comments

   I‚Äôm attempting to record all our favorite activities that I just never
   got around to writing about.  This is one of the activities we did as
   part of our focus on Creation.  I was hoping to do a whole series of
   posts on our Creation activities.  But since it‚Äôs been almost 2 years
   and I still haven‚Äôt gotten around to the task, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say
   it‚Äôs not gonna happen.  Our landform activities were simply too fun not
   to share though!

   We were talking about how God created the land and focused awhile on
   the different types of land we see. I was using the Creation story to
   fulfill our ‚Äúscience‚Äù activities.

   I chose 5 or 6 landforms (it‚Äôs been awhile so I can‚Äôt remember exactly)
   to focus on and printed one photograph and one illustration of each. I
   found all the pictures online. It would probably be a good idea to
   laminate these. Our pictures certainly got messy.

   Matching‚Äì First I had J match the illustration to the corresponding
   landform photo.  This is a great way to practice matching for any
   category, especially if your child has no trouble matching 2 pictures
   that are the same.

          Here he is showing off our mountains

   Shaving Cream fun‚Äì I brought out the shaving cream and we created our
   own examples of the landforms. Warning ‚Äì you will use A LOT of shaving
   cream if you truly want to make quality landforms. üôÇ I bought a can at
   the dollar store. J was 2 years old when we did this activity and did
   need some help making a few of the landforms. TIP: it‚Äôs a good idea to
   start with the mountains!

   After all the landforms were made, J ‚Äúlabelled‚Äù each with the correct
   picture.
   The photo doesn‚Äôt do our foam world justice üôÇ
   Of course he had tons of fun digging in the ‚Äúdirt‚Äù too!
    We threw in some bath foam fish, nothing to do with landforms but he
   liked it.
   Landform Obstacle Course ‚Äì For our last landform activity, I set up an
   obstacle course in the living room.  Pillows on the floor were islands
   that he had to hop on. Pillows stacked on a chair was our mountain. A
   blanket thrown over the table created our cave. I pushed the couch up
   to the chair to create a ‚Äúcanyon‚Äù in between.  We talked about each
   landform in the obstacle course and went on a ‚Äúbear hunt‚Äù through the
   obstacle course.  It‚Äôs so much more fun moms if you join in the
   climbing and hopping! And finally we played a game where I called out a
   landform and he had to climb, crawl or hop to it.  Lots of fun!

Let‚Äôs Practice Brushing our Teeth

   Posted on February 23, 2012 | Leave a comment

   Before J‚Äôs first trip to the dentist, we did a quick unit on teeth.  We
   talked about why to brush/floss, how to, especially bad foods, etc.
   Here‚Äôs an activiity we did that turned out pretty fun and useful.

   You‚Äôll Need: At least one teeth photo (laminated), toothbrush, water,
   various foods (the stickyer the better!)
   I laminated a few teeth photos (found on GoogleImages).  Then J
   fed the photos some good and not so good foods.  We took note of
   how each food effected the teeth (ex, icing got stuck all over the
   teeth).  Of course I let him try some of the foods too, as evidence
   shows in the photo! It did give him some real experience with how the
   foods felt in his mouth and helped him better describe the feeling.
   Then we practiced brushing the gunk away. It was a good way to get him
   to see the purpose of brushing.  We talked about where to brush (front,
   back, top, sides,‚Ä¶) and how to brush and practiced the strokes. After
   our fake teeth were clean, we headed upstairs to brush some real teeth.
   We‚Äôll probably do more practicing like this as he gets older. This was
   a fun way to teach and practice a very important part of life.

   We started a new tooth brushing song during this activity. I got tired
   of our normal brushing song (This is the way we brush our teeth‚Ä¶ like
   the mulberry song) and decided we needed a change.  J thinks our new
   brushing song is fun. I sing to the tune of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gonna Wash that Man
   Right Outta My Hair‚Äù‚Ä¶ and just change the words to‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna brush
   that cheese right off of my teeth, I‚Äôm gonna brush those blueberries
   right off those back teeth‚Ä¶ filling in whatever he just ate and
   wherever I‚Äôm brushing in his mouth. He likes to remind me all the
   different foods I have to brush off.  A year later and he still loves
   to sing this song!

   Age attempted: 2.5 years

Reading with Inflection

   Posted on February 19, 2012 | 2 comments

   Back when I taught middle school kids I was so surprised that mood was
   completely lost on so many students.  They read in a monotone, word by
   word manner. No wonder they found it boring!

   I definitely don‚Äôt want J to get stuck in that rutt.  Reading is way
   too much fun for monotone.

   So I was THRILLED when we discovered Mo Willems at our local library.
   His books are perfect for teaching and practicing inflection, even for
   the beginner or intermediate reader. And it doesn‚Äôt hurt that he is
   hilarious for both child AND adult.

   We are in a book! [Book] We especially love his Elephant and Piggie
   series. In fact I liked ‚ÄúWe are in a Book‚Äù so much that I decided to go
   out and buy it and I‚Äôm becoming quite the snob in books I deem worth
   my money.  ‚ÄúBANANA!!!‚Äù has become a source of laughter all throughout
   our day (you‚Äôll have to read the book to find out why).

   There are so many great things about these books. They are simple
   enough that J can read them all by himself but the story is still good
   enough to keep both of our attentions. So many of the beginning reader
   books are boring! These books aren‚Äôt marketed as beginning reader
   books, but I think they work great for that‚Ä¶ or maybe for intermediate
   readers. I‚Äôm not an expert in early readers! If your child has a good
   base of sight words and a basic understanding of phonics, I think they
   will manage the Elephant and Piggie books well.

   We can also read them together, each taking a different role so that we
   get to act the book out. J even wants us to imitate the faces as we
   read/act.

   Should I Share My Ice Cream? [Book] He has learned what think bubbles
   are and is getting great practice at reading with inflection which I
   just love. It‚Äôs so fun to hear J imitate the emotion and read happily,
   sadly, with disappointment or surprise, disgust, greed, embarassment,
   or even dismay, all depending on the story. That is such great
   practice! Willems does a great job of showing the emotion on the
   characters faces as well as changing the font to get the mood across
   (tiny font or gigantic font, italics, wiggly font, etc). Even my 3 year
   old can figure out it out, many times on his own!

   And of course he‚Äôs getting great practice at how to interpret the
   punctuation as he reads. Often J can pick up the purpose of the
   punctuation or font type on his own from the context of the
   story. There have been times that he‚Äôs asked why the font was so tiny
   or why the exlamation mark and the question mark are together.  Another
   plus! The books encourage him to take the initiative so that he gets it
   right.

   And did I mention that these books are funny? J and I just giggle the
   whole way through. I love that he is getting such great practice
   reading AND enjoying every second. I‚Äôm so thrilled that Willems wrote
   so many books in this series. We‚Äôve probably read at least 10 different
   Elephant and Piggie books and have lots more to check out at the
   library.

   Oh and his Knuffle Bunny series is really cute too. That‚Äôs actually the
   series that got us hooked on Mo Willems. Parents especially will find
   this series humorous. ‚ÄúBlaggle Flaggle‚Äù mom and dad, ‚ÄúBlaggle Flaggle!‚Äù

    **Willems also has a the Cat the Cat series (seems to be ideal for
   very early readers since he uses lots of repetition and use of the same
   word family throughout the book) and the Pigeon series (that will be
   next on our list to read through).

Pack a Shoebox Reminder

   Posted on November 2, 2011 | 3 comments

   Operation Christmas Child‚Äôs shoebox campaign in underway!  The national
   collection week in November 14-21, 2011.  You have 2+ weeks to plan and
   participate.  Plenty of time!  I am actually printing off the materials
   this week and planning to take J shopping over the weekend.  Click on
   the link above to find out more.

   This is something we started doing last year when J was two years old
   (you can see our experience here and the finished product here).
   **Those links include links to videos and music to help introduce to
   your kids.**
   This is a wonderful way to help little ones practice giving.  They can
   bring a shoebox to the store and fill it with fun (and useful) items.
   Bring it home, pack it up and drop it off at a pick up location near
   you.  There‚Äôs even a tracking feature so you can find out where your
   box ended up.

   J loved this last year (the photos shown are from last year).  We can‚Äôt
   wait to get started this year!

Homemade Race Car Costume

   Posted on October 10, 2011 | 6 comments

   Last year J was set on being a race car driver for Halloween.  Give me
   a quick and easy store-bought costume anyday.  So I happened on a great
   race car driver costume at the Disney Store (the link shows the 2011
   version) and called Halloween-prep completed. In the back of my mind, I
   kept thinking he needed a race car to go with his outfit.  Fast-forward
   to October 30th about 8 pm.  My parents were visiting and my mom
   agreed.  He needed a race car.
   That night we ended up crafting a Lightning McQueen race car out of a
   diaper box, wrapping paper and a few craft supplies I had around the
   house.  Our finished product turned out so cute!  J loved it.  In my
   non-biased opinion, he was the cutest trick-or-treater around!

   How to:  It was so quickly crafted (and so long ago), I don‚Äôt remember
   details.  Lots of folding and refolding cardboard (the hard part),
   taping and retaping! We wrapped a diaper box in metallic red wrapping
   paper (it was actually Christmas paper but you can‚Äôt tell), added some
   foam tires, construction paper eyes and decals (the letters are foam
   stickers).  [DEL: A little :DEL] a lot of tape and glue and you have
   the perfect race car for a Lightning McQueen fan.  Using duct tape, we
   attached Christmas ribbon to act as suspenders so that J could wear his
   car for trick-or-treating.

   This year‚Ä¶. J‚Äôs again adamant that he is a race car driver and wants
   the SAME EXACT costume.  Part of me says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not much fun!‚Äù and
   the other part sighs with relief.  No work needed this year!

Great Library Finds for Fall

   Posted on October 5, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Sometimes our library visits are well organized, I‚Äôve searched for
   books ahead of time, placed some holds, and researched authors.  Other
   times, it‚Äôs a random treasure hunt.  I love when you just happen to
   find great reads roaming the shelves! I have a feeling both of these
   authors will be place on our favorites list.

   Fletcher and the Falling Leaves Fletcher and the Falling Leaves by
   Julia Rawlinson is wonderful.  Fletcher, an adorable little fox is
   concerned for his good friend when it begins shedding‚Ä¶. leaves.  He
   tries to come to his friend‚Äôs rescue to no avail.  Then he discovers
   that his friend still has beauty to share.  Fletcher is simply
   adorable.  The artwork by Tiphanie Beeke captures the story perfectly.
   I love it!

   South by Patrick McDonnell: Book Cover South by Patrick McDonnell is a
   picture book, perfect for a toddler or preschooler ‚Äúreading‚Äù on their
   own or for mom and dad to join in.  A tiny bird sleeps through the last
   moment of fall, and finds alone when all his bird-family have flown
   south.  A friendly cat saves the day as they make the trip towards
   southern warmth together and the tiny bird reunites with his family. No
   words, just pictures.  A story beautifully told.

   Enjoy storytime and then go outside and play in the falling leaves!
