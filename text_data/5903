Introducing the newest member of our family, the YouTube Kids app--available
on Google Play and the App Store

   Monday, February 23, 2015
   Like most parents, I love helping my kids learn more about something
   they're interested in. For example, right now, I spend a lot of time on
   YouTube with my 3-year-old son, who loves watching videos of car
   washes, Super Simple Songs, and about the universe. We’re not the only
   ones: Families worldwide are watching millions of videos on YouTube.
   And lately, those of us at YouTube have been working on a new way for
   our kids—and yours—to discover and explore videos on every topic in,
   well, the universe.
   Today, we’re introducing the YouTube Kids app, the first Google product
   built from the ground up with little ones in mind. The app makes it
   safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to
   explore, and is available for free on Google Play and the App Store in
   the U.S.
   Bright and playful design
   Your 4-year-old may already be a swiping expert, but the app’s design
   makes it even easier to find Pocoyo or the latest episode of Sesame
   Street’s The Furchester Hotel. With larger images, bold icons and more,
   it’s fast and simple for little thumbs to navigate. And we’ve built in
   voice search so that even if your child can’t spell or type, they can
   still find videos of things they’re curious about.
   Family-focused content
   For years, families have come to YouTube, watching countless hours of
   videos on all kinds of topics. Now, parents can rest a little easier
   knowing that videos in the YouTube Kids app are narrowed down to
   content appropriate for kids. You can browse channels and playlists in
   four categories: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore. Or search for
   videos of particular interest to your family, like how to build a model
   volcano, math tutorials, the amazing (and endless) world of trains—and
   everything in between.
   Along with favorites from DreamWorksTV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose
   Club, Talking Tom and Friends and more, your kids can watch new series
   from YouTube channels they already like. Discover new facts about
   dinosaurs from National Geographic Kids; learn about technology from
   Reading Rainbow; or watch Thomas the Tank Engine leave the world of
   Sodor for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe. Plus, more
   new videos are coming soon from beloved YouTubers like John and Hank
   Green of the Vlogbrothers and Stampylonghead.
   Parental controls
   We realize every family is different, so we’ve built options into the
   app that help you control the experience for your kids:
     * Timer: Let the app be the bad guy with a built-in timer that lets
       you limit kids’ screen time. The app alerts your child when the
       session is over, so you don’t have to. (You’re welcome. ;) )
     * Sound settings: Sometimes you need a little peace and quiet! You
       have an option to turn off background music and sound effects, so
       your kids can keep watching while you catch a breather.
     * Search settings: If you’d rather limit your children to just the
       pre-selected videos available on the home screen, you can turn off
       search.
     * Product feedback: Our goal is to improve YouTube Kids all the time,
       so we’ve included a space for you to give us your feedback.

   YouTube Kids is available for free starting today in the U.S. on Google
   Play and the App Store, and will soon be available on Kurio and nabi
   kids’ tablets.
   This is the first step toward reimagining YouTube for families, but
   with your help, the app will continue to get better over time. We’re
   excited to start this chapter with you—so from our family to yours,
   enjoy!

YouTube AdBlitz votes are in, and the winner is ...

   Friday, February 13, 2015
   The last great battle for big game ad supremacy was waged last week as
   votes for your favorite ads came flooding in. Not only was this the
   biggest year ever for big game ads on YouTube, this was a banner year
   for the ads on the YouTube AdBlitz channel.
   With nearly 40 percent more total votes cast this year than last, this
   year’s fan favorite received 60 percent more votes than last year’s top
   pick. And which brand landed on top of the list this year?
   Congrats to Nissan, voted by fans to be their Favorite Super Bowl
   Commercial of 2015. Nissan tugged your heartstrings showcasing their
   “With Dad” commercial, and garnered the most votes against some very
   stiff competition to become the YouTube AdBlitz 2015 Champion!

   Here are the rest of the top 5 favorite big game ads as determined by
   your votes: Landing in second place is Clash of Clans’ “Revenge” spot
   featuring one “Angry Neeson.”

   In third, Dodge inspired us with some generational “Wisdom.”

   Last year’s winner, Budweiser, had another strong showing with their
   “Lost Dog” commercial coming in fourth.

   And rounding out our top 5 is Jeep, who explored the beauty of the
   globe with “Beautiful Lands.”

Biggest year ever for big game ads on YouTube

   Friday, February 6, 2015
   This year’s football season might be done and dusted, but the battle
   for most popular big game ad is still in play. To see how trends have
   played out in the days since the game, we took a look at the top
   trending videos, facts, and stats about big game ads on YouTube.
   We found that viewership is growing faster than before - people have
   watched more big game ads and teasers in the first six weeks of 2015
   than all 52 weeks of 2014. More than 7M hours of big game ads and
   teasers have been watched on YouTube, up from 6.3M hours for all of
   2014.

   Liam cinches his “Revenge”
   One of the surprise hits this week was Clash of Clan’s “Revenge” ad
   featuring Liam Neeson. The spot gained over 20M views this week alone
   and now clocks in at more than 30M views, making it the most viewed big
   game ad on YouTube so far. Here’s a look at viewership of game day ads
   over time, from a report by Pixability:

   (Source: Pixability report “Super Bowl Ads on YouTube,” February 5)
   Beards and selfies infiltrate top trending ads
   As expected, puppies and celebrities dominated the top trending ads on
   YouTube. But there were also some lesser-reported trends that spanned
   across the top game day ads. We found that:
     * Half of the top 10 ads featured men with beards
     * 21 different types of animals (animated or otherwise) made an
       appearance
     * Two ads had people taking selfies
     * Two ads featured no dialogue at all
     * One: the total number of “Angry Neesons”

   Here’s a list of the top trending game day ads on YouTube (based on
   views as of 2/6):

   There are still three more days to cast your vote for your favorite ad
   of the game. Visit our AdBlitz channel to cast your ballot before
   voting ends on February 9 at 11:59 p.m. ET.

Shooting stars and puppy ads: How the world watched the big game

   Monday, February 2, 2015
   From a “super brawl” to a giant lion, yesterday’s big game was filled
   with many notable moments. That’s true on YouTube and Google too—people
   watched more game day ads and teaser videos on YouTube than ever
   before, YouTube hosted its first-ever halftime show, and a throwback
   PSA became a top trending search term. Here’s a look at the top
   trending searches, videos and more across Google and YouTube:
   Battle of the brands
   As the battle for football supremacy was taking place on the field, a
   very different battle was raging across the country: Which ad would
   reign supreme? Whether via smartphone, tablet or laptop, people spent
   nearly 4 million hours watching game-day ads and teaser videos on
   YouTube—up from 2.2 million hours from this time last year.
   TopAdsQuestions_OGBPost.jpg
   This year’s most popular ads came from a wide range of
   advertisers—newcomers and veterans alike. But one thing’s for
   certain—puppies, pranks, and Kim Kardashian continue to “break the
   Internet.” Here are the ads that scored big on YouTube so far:
   [YouTube-Superbowl-2-r1.jpg]
   YouTube has evolved to become the place brands go to engage with their
   audience before, during, and after the big game. That’s why revenue
   from our AdBlitz program set a new record this year, with brands
   investing more on YouTube around the big game than years past. And,
   we’ve hit a new record in watchtime across YouTube—the growth rate at
   which people are watching YouTube has nearly doubled in the last year,
   leading to the fastest growth we've seen in years.
   Tom Brady and Missy Elliott dominate on search
   While people turned to YouTube to watch the ads, people turned to
   Google to search for everything from “how old is Tom Brady” to “buffalo
   chicken dip recipes” to “Katy Perry Halftime performance.” Before
   kickoff, people asked Google “Why did John Travolta call Idina
   ‘Adele’?”—a throwback to John Travolta’s infamous mispronunciation of
   National Anthem performer Idina Menzel's name at the 2014 Oscars.
   Searchers were also interested in Menzel’s performance (or researching
   prop bets), asking “How long will it take Idina to sing the National
   Anthem?”
   Tom Brady, Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson were the top three
   searched players before, during and after the game. Thanks to some
   standout in-game performances, by the end they were sharing the
   spotlight: Rob Gronkowski and Chris Matthews (replacing Richard Sherman
   and Kam Chancellor). And MVP Tom Brady wasn’t just an MVP on the
   field—he captured the title of “Most Searched Quarterback” in every
   state except for the Seahawks’ home Washington.
   QBMap_OGBPost.jpg
   Of course, for many people the halftime show is the highlight of the
   night, and Katy Perry’s performance delivered. She came in on a lion,
   danced with sharks and went out on a star—one that was, for some,
   reminiscent of NBC’s old “The More You Know” PSAs. The phrase "The More
   You Know" spiked 190x in search for the 10 minutes after Katy’s starry
   flight. And although Missy Elliott was a late addition to the halftime
   lineup, she was a popular topic in search. Top questions related to
   Missy Elliott included “When was Missy Elliott popular?” and “How does
   Katy Perry know Missy Elliott?”
   A very YouTube halftime show
   For the first time ever, this year YouTube hosted a Halftime Show
   produced by Collective Digital Studio, with the help of more than 25
   YouTube creators including Epic Meal Time's Harley Morenstein as host,
   Rhett & Link, Toby Turner, Freddie Wong and Tyler Ward. From Kurt Hugo
   Schneider’s "Epic Patty Cake Song" to the “Elephant’s Toothpaste”
   science experiment with Science Bob, the show delivered a one-of-a-kind
   experience for YouTube fans.

   With the last touchdown scored, we’re taking votes for your favorite
   ad, so visit our AdBlitz channel to cast your ballot before voting ends
   on February 9 at 11:59pm ET. Thanks for making this year our biggest
   game ever.
   Whether you’re a loyal 12th man or a Boston fan for life, chances are
   you turned to YouTube and Google to watch your favorite ads, answer
   your questions or witness a new generation of halftime entertainment.
   We’re happy we could be a part of your game.

Appeal of Conscience Foundation Remarks

   Tuesday, September 24, 2019
   The following speech was delivered last night by Susan Wojcicki at the
   Appeal of Conscience Foundation Awards Dinner. Founded in 1965, the
   Appeal of Conscience Foundation is an interfaith coalition of business
   and religious leaders that works to promote religious freedom and human
   rights throughout the world.
   It’s an honor to be here tonight.
   You’ve helped create a more peaceful world, and your work to bring
   diverse voices together is particularly important to me.
   I have a deep appreciation for interfaith discussions, since I saw them
   around the kitchen table in my childhood. My mother came from a
   religious Jewish family and my father came from a Polish Catholic
   family. And as a result, I grew up learning to accept and appreciate so
   many different points of view.
   For more than 50 years, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation has
   promoted mutual understanding.
   At YouTube, we haven’t been around quite as long—just 14 years, to be
   exact. But we have a similar mission. We’re enabling understanding
   through digital dialogue, and we’re bringing people together with
   shared interests in virtual communities.
   I was lucky I was one of the few people in the world to see online
   videos when this medium started. The first video I saw was of some
   purple puppets singing in a foreign language. I wasn’t sure what to
   think. When it ended there was a long pause because none of us knew
   what to think. And then my kids shouted, “Play it again!”
   As more videos came online there were wacky and funny videos, but also
   many videos of people talking directly to the camera sharing something
   important about their lives—a passion, a funny moment or a hard day.
   It was immediately clear to me that people wanted to share their
   stories with others. But what surprised me even more is that so many
   other people wanted to hear these stories. From the very beginning, I
   could see that YouTube was a place for coming together in new ways and
   sharing our humanity.
   Today, two billion people come to YouTube every month. Their reasons
   are different—some want to connect with others around a shared passion
   like woodworking or see the latest in fashion. Others want to watch the
   hottest music video, learn a foreign language, listen to religious
   sermons of all faiths, or perfect a job skill.
   For the first time in history, with a phone and an internet connection,
   everyone can access a global video library and anyone can post videos
   and find a global audience. We call the people who publish videos
   “creators.”
   There are more than 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute
   by creators.
   Collectively, creators have generated the world’s largest video library
   of How To content—from how to play an instrument to how to fix an
   appliance. And they’ve created new mediums like vlogging, gaming and
   music mashups.
   But we know that with this scale comes responsibility. That’s why
   responsibility is my number one priority.
   Before I talk further about our important work on this front, I’d like
   to share a few examples of how online spaces foster dialogue and help
   build mutual understanding.
   When I watched my first YouTube video, I could never have imagined that
   someday a teenager named Claire Wineland would start a YouTube channel
   out of her bedroom in California to cope with the complications of
   living with cystic fibrosis.
   Claire saw the way we treat illness in our society, and she wanted
   something different. Claire passed away last year, but she leaves
   behind a legacy of videos to help us understand how to support someone
   who is struggling with serious medical issues.
   When I watched my first YouTube video, I never could have imagined that
   someday Jenny Doan, a mother of seven in Missouri, would create a
   business out of quilt making by posting How To Quilt videos on YouTube.
   Ten years after her son first encouraged her to post a tutorial, her
   channel has helped to transform her town into what they now call "the
   Disneyland of quilting"—creating jobs and drawing thousands of tourists
   every month who share a passion for quilting.
   Every day, there are many more stories like these unfolding on YouTube.
   And that’s why I’m so focused on our responsibility. It’s critical that
   we get this right.
   Our responsibility efforts are focused on the 4 Rs:
     * Our first R—Remove. We’re removing content that violates our
       policies as quickly as possible. In the last quarter alone, we
       removed 9 million videos, the majority of which were first flagged
       by machines and removed before even getting a single view.

     * Second, Raise: we raise up authoritative voices in searches and
       recommendations for news and information,

     * Third, Reduce: we’re reducing recommendations of the content that
       brushes up against our policies,

     * And finally, Reward. We set an even higher bar for videos on
       YouTube that make money on our site.

   We’re working hard to implement all of the four Rs in a way that’s both
   fair and transparent for all our users and creators.
   That’s why we’re continuing to invest in cutting-edge machine learning
   technology and why we’ve dedicated more than 10,000 people across
   Google to take on problematic videos.
   These are historic times. Never before have we had the opportunity for
   so many around the globe to connect online, express their points of
   view, and create virtual communities, all under the same roof.
   Having a digital town square where the world can come together and
   discuss everything has created some challenges…but it has also created
   extraordinary opportunities.
   It’s these opportunities that inspire me every day. As we take on these
   complicated and unprecedented issues of responsibility at scale, I
   think about the decisions of today through the lens of the future. What
   will the critics say when they write their commentaries about this
   unique period of time?
   I want to be sure that we’re on the right side of history, providing a
   blueprint for open platforms to protect but also empower the next
   generation of storytellers.
   Thank you to the Appeal of Conscience Foundation for your efforts, and
   for encouraging all of us to make the world a better place.

Maintaining credibility and consistency on YouTube: Revisions to YouTube
Music Charts and 24-hour record debut policy

   Friday, September 13, 2019
   From “American Bandstand” to “TRL,” every generation naturally finds
   its own barometer to measure the hottest songs and artists of the
   moment. For this generation, it’s YouTube. There is simply no better
   current measure of the world’s music listening than YouTube. Every day,
   we strive to showcase and celebrate the hottest artists, songs and
   music videos from around the world.
   Today, we’re sharing some important changes made to YouTube Music
   Charts, the go-to destination to see what’s popular, what’s rising and
   trending both locally and globally on YouTube, and updates to how we
   determine videos that are eligible for 24-hour record debuts on
   YouTube.
   YouTube Music Charts have become an indispensable source for the
   industry and the most accurate place for measuring the popularity of
   music listening behavior happening on the world’s largest music
   platform. In an effort to provide more transparency to the industry and
   align with the policies of official charting companies such as
   Billboard and Nielsen, we are no longer counting paid advertising views
   on YouTube in the YouTube Music Charts calculation. Artists will now be
   ranked based on view counts from organic plays.
   Over the last few years, fans, artists, and their teams have touted the
   number of views a video receives on YouTube within the first 24 hours
   as the definitive representation of its instant cultural impact. It’s a
   great honor and one we take very seriously. As we look to maintain
   consistency and credibility across our platform, we’ve made some
   necessary revisions to our methodology for reporting 24-hour record
   debuts.
   Our goal is to ensure YouTube remains a place where all artists are
   accurately recognized and celebrated for achieving success and
   milestones. Videos eligible for YouTube’s 24-hour record debuts are
   those with the highest views from organic sources within the first 24
   hours of the video’s public release. This includes direct links to the
   video, search results, external sites that embed the video and YouTube
   features like the homepage, watch next and Trending. Video advertising
   is an effective way to reach specific audiences with a song debut, but
   paid advertising views on YouTube will no longer be considered when
   looking at a 24-hour record debut. The changes will not impact
   YouTube’s existing 24-hour record debut holders.
   Staying true to YouTube’s overall mission of giving everyone a voice
   and showing them the world, we want to celebrate all artist
   achievements on YouTube as determined by their global fans. It’s the
   artists and fans that have made YouTube the best and most accurate
   measure of the world's listening tastes, and we intend on keeping it
   that way.
   Additional information on how YouTube Music Charts are calculated can
   be found here and additional details about YouTube Views and ads can be
   found here.

Welcome to YouTube.com/Fashion!

   Thursday, September 5, 2019
   Exciting day for fashion fans: Today, we’re launching
   YouTube.com/Fashion, a single destination for style content on YouTube.
   My team likes to call this new hub “slash fashion” and it’ll feature
   original content from the biggest names in the industry, as well as the
   popular content that users have come to expect from the world of
   YouTube. Each shelf is chock-full of compelling videos from fashion and
   beauty creators, industry professionals, publishers, and luxury fashion
   brands.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBaGHP_UuLI

   When I joined YouTube a little more than a year ago, I immediately saw
   the platform’s insatiable desire for more fashion and beauty! And the
   data backs it up: From 2014 to 2018, the number of Fashion & Beauty
   channels on YouTube has grown over 6x, generating billions of views in
   the last year alone.
   My response? Give the people what they want! The aim for /Fashion is to
   create an ultimate destination for style content that bridges both our
   fabulous endemic creator community and the more traditional worlds of
   fashion and beauty. My hope is that anyone looking for all things style
   will now have a place to come and be inspired by what they see.
   [fashion.png]
   Here’s what to expect:

Style content from your favorite YouTube creators

   Creators are, and always will be, the heartbeat of our platform and
   /Fashion is no exception. We’ll have a featured section dedicated to
   creators where you can get ready with Camila Coelho, join Jenn Im for a
   Fendi fashion show in Rome, watch Ingrid Nilsen attend the CFDA Awards
   with Chanel, and comment on style challenges from Safiya Nygaard.
   Looking for the latest in beauty? Check out our ‘Beauty Today’ section
   where you can find content from gurus such as Jackie Aina and Huda
   Beauty.

Industry collaborations

   One of the most thrilling parts of the new Fashion & Beauty department
   has been to foster collaborations between fashion brands and our
   creators. Look no further than Louis Vuitton, who teamed up with Emma
   Chamberlain and the Dolan Twins; and Dior, who invited Wengie, the
   Merrell Twins, Dulceida and Juanpa Zurita to their shows in the past 12
   months to create fabulous fashion content. We’ve also helped
   established creators welcome new fashion professionals onto the
   platform, like when RuPaul’s Drag Race winner (and fledging YouTube
   creator) Violet Chachki teamed up with Gigi Gorgeous for a makeup
   makeover.

Straight from the Runway

   Just in time for the kickoff of September Fashion Month, we’ll be
   livestreaming the latest collections straight from the runway,
   including Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Dior and more. We’ll also take
   you behind-the-scenes with “Stories of Style,” giving you an inside
   look into the industry with content from fashion favorites, such as
   Alexander Wang, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung. (PS. While I
   have you, check out this vlog comedian Pete Davidson did of walking the
   Wang runway this summer.)

Industry access

   We’re also excited to bring new voices onto YouTube from across the
   industry, including fashion professionals, publishers and brands. One
   of our breakouts has been ‘Being Naomi,’ Naomi Campbell’s new channel
   that covers everything from her preflight routine to her emotional
   return to the Valentino runway. Go behind-the-scenes with LOVE Magazine
   and British Vogue for fresh takes on industry icons and join Gucci for
   their ‘Second Summer of Love’ collaboration with Frieze.
   Our goal is to make YouTube.com/Fashion a diverse and inclusive place,
   filled with the latest fashion and beauty trends, content and more.
   We’ll be working over the coming months to bring more international
   voices to the page and to localize for global markets. We can’t wait
   for you to explore our new offering, get inspired by all the great
   content, and share your favorites with friends. Be sure to come back
   often, as we have a lot more to come!

An update on kids and data protection on YouTube

   Wednesday, September 4, 2019
   Responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and nothing is
   more important than protecting kids and their privacy. We’ve been
   significantly investing in the policies, products and practices to help
   us do this. From its earliest days, YouTube has been a site for people
   over 13, but with a boom in family content and the rise of shared
   devices, the likelihood of children watching without supervision has
   increased. We’ve been taking a hard look at areas where we can do more
   to address this, informed by feedback from parents, experts, and
   regulators, including COPPA concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade
   Commission and the New York Attorney General that we are addressing
   with a settlement announced today.

New data practices for children’s content on YouTube

   We are changing how we treat data for children’s content on YouTube.
   Starting in about four months, we will treat data from anyone watching
   children’s content on YouTube as coming from a child, regardless of the
   age of the user. This means that we will limit data collection and use
   on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation
   of the service. We will also stop serving personalized ads on this
   content entirely, and some features will no longer be available on this
   type of content, like comments and notifications. In order to identify
   content made for kids, creators will be required to tell us when their
   content falls in this category, and we’ll also use machine learning to
   find videos that clearly target young audiences, for example those that
   have an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys, or games.

Improvements to YouTube Kids

   We continue to recommend parents use YouTube Kids if they plan to allow
   kids under 13 to watch independently. Tens of millions of people use
   YouTube Kids every week but we want even more parents to be aware of
   the app and its benefits. We’re increasing our investments in promoting
   YouTube Kids to parents with a campaign that will run across YouTube.
   We’re also continuing to improve the product. For example, we recently
   raised the bar for which channels can be a part of YouTube Kids,
   drastically reducing the number of channels on the app. And we’re
   bringing the YouTube Kids experience to the desktop.

Investing in family creators

   We know these changes will have a significant business impact on family
   and kids creators who have been building both wonderful content and
   thriving businesses, so we've worked to give impacted creators four
   months to adjust before changes take effect on YouTube. We recognize
   this won’t be easy for some creators and are committed to working with
   them through this transition and providing resources to help them
   better understand these changes.
   We are also going to continue investing in the future of quality kids,
   family and educational content. We are establishing a $100 million
   fund, disbursed over three years, dedicated to the creation of
   thoughtful, original children’s content on YouTube and YouTube Kids
   globally.

Training our teams

   Championing the protections we have in place for children is a shared
   responsibility across the company. To that end, we are introducing new,
   mandatory annual training for our teams about our requirements in this
   area.
   Today’s changes will allow us to better protect kids and families on
   YouTube, and this is just the beginning. We'll continue working with
   lawmakers around the world in this area, including as the FTC seeks
   comments on COPPA. And in the coming months, we’ll share details on how
   we’re rethinking our overall approach to kids and families, including a
   dedicated kids experience on YouTube. I have the privilege of working
   alongside parents who deeply care about protecting kids. We know how
   important it is to provide children, families and family creators the
   best experience possible on YouTube and we are committed to getting it
   right.

The Four Rs of Responsibility, Part 1: Removing harmful content

   Tuesday, September 3, 2019
   Over the past several years, we’ve redoubled our efforts to live up to
   our responsibility while preserving the power of an open platform. Our
   work has been organized around four principles:
   [English_resp_time_visuals-01.png]
   Over the next several months, we’ll provide more detail on the work
   supporting each of these principles. This first installment will focus
   on "Remove." We've been removing harmful content since YouTube started,
   but our investment in this work has accelerated in recent years. Below
   is a snapshot of our most notable improvements since 2016. Because of
   this ongoing work, over the last 18 months we’ve reduced views on
   videos that are later removed for violating our policies by 80%, and
   we’re continuously working to reduce this number further.^1
   [YT_resptime_v24_ai-remove-01.png]

Developing policies for a global platform

   Before we do the work of removing content that violates our policies,
   we have to make sure the line between what we remove and what we allow
   is drawn in the right place — with a goal of preserving free
   expression, while also protecting and promoting a vibrant community. To
   that end, we have a dedicated policy development team that
   systematically reviews all of our policies to ensure that they are
   current, keep our community safe, and do not stifle YouTube’s openness.
   After reviewing a policy, we often discover that fundamental changes
   aren’t needed, but still uncover areas that are vague or confusing to
   the community. As a result, many updates are actually clarifications to
   our existing guidelines. For example, earlier this year we provided
   more detail about when we consider a “challenge” to be too dangerous
   for YouTube. Since 2018, we’ve made dozens of updates to our
   enforcement guidelines, many of them minor clarifications but some more
   substantive.
   For particularly complex issues, we may spend several months developing
   a new policy. During this time we consult outside experts and YouTube
   creators to understand how our current policy is falling short, and
   consider regional differences to make sure proposed changes can be
   applied fairly around the world.
   Our hate speech update represented one such fundamental shift in our
   policies. We spent months carefully developing the policy and working
   with our teams to create the necessary trainings and tools required to
   enforce it. The policy was launched in early June, and as our teams
   review and remove more content in line with the new policy, our machine
   detection will improve in tandem. Though it can take months for us to
   ramp up enforcement of a new policy, the profound impact of our hate
   speech policy update is already evident in the data released in this
   quarter’s Community Guidelines Enforcement Report:
   [YT_resp_time_visuals_final-02.png]
   The spikes in removal numbers are in part due to the removal of older
   comments, videos and channels that were previously permitted. In April
   2019, we announced that we are also working to update our harassment
   policy, including creator-on-creator harassment. We’ll share our
   progress on this work in the coming months.

Using machines to flag bad content

   Once we’ve defined a policy, we rely on a combination of people and
   technology to flag content for our review teams. We sometimes use
   hashes (or “digital fingerprints”) to catch copies of known violative
   content before they are ever made available to view. For some content,
   like child sexual abuse images (CSAI) and terrorist recruitment videos,
   we contribute to shared industry databases of hashes to increase the
   volume of content our machines can catch at upload.
   In 2017, we expanded our use of machine learning technology to help
   detect potentially violative content and send it for human review.
   Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to
   find content similar (but not exactly the same) to other content we’ve
   already removed, even before it’s ever viewed. These systems are
   particularly effective at flagging content that often looks the same —
   such as spam or adult content. Machines also can help to flag hate
   speech and other violative content, but these categories are highly
   dependent on context and highlight the importance of human review to
   make nuanced decisions. Still, over 87% of the 9 million videos we
   removed in the second quarter of 2019 were first flagged by our
   automated systems.
   We’re investing significantly in these automated detection systems, and
   our engineering teams continue to update and improve them month by
   month. For example, an update to our spam detection systems in the
   second quarter of 2019 lead to a more than 50% increase in the number
   of channels we terminated for violating our spam policies.

Removing content before it’s widely viewed

   We go to great lengths to make sure content that breaks our rules isn’t
   widely viewed, or even viewed at all, before it’s removed. As noted
   above, improvements in our automated flagging systems have helped us
   detect and review content even before it’s flagged by our community,
   and consequently more than 80% of those auto-flagged videos were
   removed before they received a single view in the second quarter of
   2019.
   We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to
   anticipate problems before they emerge. In January of 2018 we launched
   our Intelligence Desk, a team that monitors the news, social media and
   user reports in order to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate
   content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them
   before they can become a larger issue.
   We’re determined to continue reducing exposure to videos that violate
   our policies. That’s why, across Google, we’ve tasked over 10,000
   people with detecting, reviewing, and removing content that violates
   our guidelines.
   [YT_resp_time_visuals_final-03.png]
   For example, the nearly 30,000 videos we removed for hate speech over
   the last month generated just 3% of the views that knitting videos did
   over the same time period.
   Last week we updated our Community Guidelines Enforcement Report, a
   quarterly report that provides additional insight into the amount of
   content we remove from YouTube, why it was removed, and how it was
   first detected. That report demonstrates how technology deployed over
   the last several years has helped us to remove harmful content from
   YouTube more quickly than ever before. It also highlights how human
   expertise is still a critical component of our enforcement efforts, as
   we work to develop thoughtful policies, review content with care, and
   responsibly deploy our machine learning technology.

An update on our efforts to protect minors and families

   Monday, June 3, 2019
   Responsibility is our number one priority, and chief among our areas of
   focus is protecting minors and families. Over the years, we’ve heavily
   invested in a number of technologies and efforts to protect young
   people on our platform, such as our CSAI Match technology. And in 2015,
   because YouTube has never been for kids under 13, we created YouTube
   Kids as a way for kids to be able to safely explore their interests and
   for parents to have more control. Accounts belonging to people under 13
   are terminated when discovered. In fact, we terminate thousands of
   accounts per week as part of this process.
   We also enforce a strong set of policies to protect minors on our
   platform, including those that prohibit exploiting minors, encouraging
   dangerous or inappropriate behaviors, and aggregating videos of minors
   in potentially exploitative ways. In the first quarter of 2019 alone,
   we removed more than 800,000 videos for violations of our child safety
   policies, the majority of these before they had ten views.
   The vast majority of videos featuring minors on YouTube, including
   those referenced in recent news reports, do not violate our policies
   and are innocently posted — a family creator providing educational
   tips, or a parent sharing a proud moment. But when it comes to kids, we
   take an extra cautious approach towards our enforcement and we’re
   always making improvements to our protections. Here are a few updates
   we’ve made over the past several months:
     * Restricting live features: We updated enforcement of our live
       streaming policy to specifically disallow younger minors from live
       streaming unless they are clearly accompanied by an adult. Channels
       not in compliance with this policy may lose their ability to live
       stream. We also launched new classifiers (machine learning tools
       that help us identify specific types of content) on our live
       products to find and remove more of this content.

     * Disabling comments on videos featuring minors: We disabled comments
       on tens of millions of videos featuring minors across the platform,
       to limit the risk of exploitation. Additionally, we implemented a
       classifier that helped us remove 2x the number of violative
       comments. We recognize that comments are a core part of the YouTube
       experience and creators have told us they feel we removed a
       valuable way for them to connect with and grow audiences. But we
       strongly believe this is an important step to keeping young people
       safe on YouTube.

     * Reducing recommendations: We expanded our efforts from earlier this
       year around limiting recommendations of borderline content to
       include videos featuring minors in risky situations. While the
       content itself does not violate our policies, we recognize the
       minors could be at risk of online or offline exploitation. We’ve
       already applied these changes to tens of millions of videos across
       YouTube.

   Over the last 2+ years, we’ve been making regular improvements to the
   machine learning classifier that helps us protect minors and families.
   We rolled out our most recent improvement earlier this month. With this
   update, we’ll be able to better identify videos that may put minors at
   risk and apply our protections, including those described above, across
   even more videos.
   To stay informed of the latest research and advances in child safety,
   we work with civil society and law enforcement. In the last two years,
   we've shared tens of thousands of reports with NCMEC, leading to
   numerous law enforcement investigations.^1 Additionally, we share our
   technologies and expertise with the industry, and consult with outside
   experts to complement our team of in-house experts.
   YouTube is a company made up of parents and families, and we’ll always
   do everything we can to prevent any use of our platform that attempts
   to exploit or endanger minors. Kids and families deserve the best
   protection we have to offer: We’re committed to investing in the teams
   and technology to make sure they get it.

Introducing new choices for parents to further customize YouTube Kids

   Wednesday, April 25, 2018
   When we launched the YouTube Kids app three years ago, our goal was to
   give kids around the world a place to access videos that were
   enriching, engaging and allowed them to explore their endless
   interests.
   Since then, our team has continued to work to improve the app
   experience for kids and families around the world. One area of focus
   has been building new features that give parents even more control
   around the content available in the YouTube Kids app so they can make
   the right choice for their unique family and for each child within
   their family.
   We are excited to announce that throughout the year, we will be rolling
   out three new options in YouTube Kids:
     * Collections by trusted partners and YouTube Kids: Starting this
       week, our partners and the YouTube Kids team will offer collections
       of trusted channels on a variety of subjects from arts & crafts and
       music to sports, learning, and so much more. This makes it easy for
       parents to select only the channel collections and topics they want
       their kids to access. Just go into Profile Settings, and select
       from available collections such as Sesame Workshop and PBS KIDS. We
       will continue to add more partners over time.

   [US_settings.png]
     * Parent approved content: Parents know better than anyone what they
       want their children to watch. For those parents who want even more
       control over the videos and channels in the YouTube Kids app, we’re
       rolling out a feature later this year that will allow parents to
       specifically handpick every video and channel available to their
       child in the app.
     * Improved search-off control for an even more contained experience:
       Parents have always been able to turn search off within the YouTube
       Kids app, but starting this week turning search off will limit the
       YouTube Kids experience to channels that have been verified by the
       YouTube Kids team. This means that search off will not include
       recommendations from the broader YouTube Kids corpus.

   For parents who like the current version of YouTube Kids and want a
   wider selection of content, it’s still available. While no system is
   perfect, we continue to fine-tune, rigorously test and improve our
   filters for this more open version of our app. And, as always, we
   encourage parents to block and flag videos for review that they don't
   think should be in the YouTube Kids app. This makes YouTube Kids better
   for everyone.
   It is our hope that these additional options will allow every family to
   have the experience they want in the YouTube Kids app.
   James Beser, Product Director for YouTube Kids, recently watched
   "Photosynthesis for Kids" on the Kids Learning Tube channel with his
   2nd grade daughter.

5 ways we’re toughening our approach to protect families on YouTube and
YouTube Kids

   Wednesday, November 22, 2017
   In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on
   YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not.
   While some of these videos may be suitable for adults, others are
   completely unacceptable, so we are working to remove them from YouTube.
   Here’s what we’re doing:
    1. Tougher application of our Community Guidelines and faster
       enforcement through technology: We have always had strict policies
       against child endangerment, and we partner closely with regional
       authorities and experts to help us enforce these policies and
       report to law enforcement through NCMEC. In the last couple of
       weeks we expanded our enforcement guidelines around removing
       content featuring minors that may be endangering a child, even if
       that was not the uploader’s intent. In the last week we terminated
       over 50 channels and have removed thousands of videos under these
       guidelines, and we will continue to work quickly to remove more
       every day. We also implemented policies to age-restrict (only
       available to people over 18 and logged in) content with family
       entertainment characters but containing mature themes or adult
       humor. To help surface potentially violative content, we are
       applying machine learning technology and automated tools to quickly
       find and escalate for human review.
    2. Removing ads from inappropriate videos targeting families: Back in
       June, we posted an update to our advertiser-friendly guidelines
       making it clear that we will remove ads from any content depicting
       family entertainment characters engaged in violent, offensive, or
       otherwise inappropriate behavior, even if done for comedic or
       satirical purposes. Since June, we've removed ads from 3M videos
       under this policy and we’ve further strengthened the application of
       that policy to remove ads from another 500K violative videos.
    3. Blocking inappropriate comments on videos featuring minors: We have
       historically used a combination of automated systems and human
       flagging and review to remove inappropriate sexual or predatory
       comments on videos featuring minors. Comments of this nature are
       abhorrent and we work with NCMEC to report illegal behavior to law
       enforcement. Starting this week we will begin taking an even more
       aggressive stance by turning off all comments on videos of minors
       where we see these types of comments.
    4. Providing guidance for creators who make family-friendly content:
       We've created a platform for people to view family-friendly content
       -- YouTube Kids. We want to help creators produce quality content
       for the YouTube Kids app, so in the coming weeks we will release a
       comprehensive guide on how creators can make enriching family
       content for the app.
    5. Engaging and learning from experts: While there is some content
       that clearly doesn’t belong on YouTube, there is other content that
       is more nuanced or challenging to make a clear decision on. For
       example, today, there are many cartoons in mainstream entertainment
       that are targeted towards adults, and feature characters doing
       things we wouldn’t necessarily want children to see. Those may be
       OK for YouTube.com, or if we require the viewer to be over 18, but
       not for someone younger. Similarly, an adult dressed as a popular
       family character could be questionable content for some audiences,
       but could also be meant for adults recorded at a comic book
       convention. To help us better understand how to treat this content,
       we will be growing the number of experts we work with, and doubling
       the number of Trusted Flaggers we partner with in this area.

   Across the board we have scaled up resources to ensure that thousands
   of people are working around the clock to monitor, review and make the
   right decisions across our ads and content policies. These latest
   enforcement changes will take shape over the weeks and months ahead as
   we work to tackle this evolving challenge. We’re wholly committed to
   addressing these issues and will continue to invest the engineering and
   human resources needed to get it right. As a parent and as a leader in
   this organization, I’m determined that we do.
