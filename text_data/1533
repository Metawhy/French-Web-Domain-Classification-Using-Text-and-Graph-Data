Boost C++ Libraries Boost C++ Libraries

   "...one of the most highly regarded and expertly designed C++ library
   projects in the world." â€” Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu, C++
   Coding Standards

Welcome to Boost.org!

   Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

   We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
   Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a
   broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both
   commercial and non-commercial use.

   We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference
   implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
   standardization. Ten Boost libraries are included in the C++ Standards
   Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and in the new C++11
   Standard. C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in addition
   to those from TR1. More Boost libraries are proposed for
   standardization in C++17.

   Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference related to Boost
   called C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado each May. Boost has
   been a participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007.

Getting Started

   Boost works on almost any modern operating system, including UNIX and
   Windows variants. Follow the Getting Started Guide to download and
   install Boost. Popular Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora,
   Debian, and NetBSD include pre-built Boost packages. Boost may also
   already be available on your organization's internal web server.

   If you want to develop Boost, there's a getting started guide on the
   wiki.

Background

   Read on with the introductory material to help you understand what
   Boost is about and to help in educating your organization about Boost.

Community

   Boost welcomes and thrives on participation from a variety of
   individuals and organizations. Many avenues for participation are
   available in the Boost Community.
