4 Rules for Creating an Active Recovery Workout – Smart Motivation Ideas

   4-rules-for-creating-an-active-recovery-workout-smart-motivation-ideas1

   Image from https://www.self.com/

   Achieving fitness goals requires strategic exercises and rest and
   recovery days as well. After a series of actions on your muscles, your
   body will start to beg for a rest day and you may get confused about
   what a rest day should be like. An active rest, also known as active
   recovery, will help to loosen the stiff muscles and will leave you
   feeling energized and ready for another round of workouts. This active
   recovery is not meant to be another form of exercise, so you should not
   go too hard on it. It should only be hard enough to create proper blood
   circulation in all of the organs and muscles to aid fast and proper
   recovery. You will note that your body will quickly recover from pain
   and soreness when you have an active rest.

   Benefits of active recovery

   Being active has the benefit of clearing out lactic acid that is
   produced by the muscles. During an intensive workout, lactic acid is
   produced as an alternative source of energy to supply the muscles when
   they run low on glucose and oxygen. It is the same chemical that gives
   you a burning sensation after a session of intensive workouts, and
   clearing it from the body will help you to ease the post-workout pain
   and muscle soreness. Being active also makes you recover more quickly
   because you increase the circulation of the lymph system and blood and
   your joints are lubricated to improve mobility.
   Building muscle and power does not come easily, and sometimes you may
   get impatient with the results that you are getting after a few weeks
   of working out. The secret behind having a good physique and not just a
   slim body is including a variety of workouts that work on your whole
   body. For your muscles to repair the tears in them, you have to rest to
   realize what you have been working for. Besides rest, steroids can come
   in handy in supplementing your diet and workouts to help you achieve
   your fitness goals and recover. It is crucial to buy steroids from
   reliable vendors who sell quality and genuine products, and you can
   easily get them online, for example at https://musclesfax.ws/.

   4-rules-for-creating-an-active-recovery-workout-smart-motivation-ideas6
   Image from https://21dias.top/

   A good diet is also irreplaceable and what you eat determines the
   energy your body has for a workout. You can also work with a fitness
   expert to guide you on your diet on your journey to fitness and avoid
   hitting a plateau, which is common for those who are trying to lose
   weight and build muscles. Protein is an essential component of any diet
   when it comes to repairing worn-out cells, and you should therefore
   include plenty of it in during active recovery. A high fiber diet also
   helps you to stay full and gives you energy throughout the day to avoid
   cravings.
   Muscle pain makes many quit the journey of fitness, and it comes mostly
   when you take a passive rest. This is because you will take a longer
   time to heal, and by the time you are going back to the normal
   workouts, you have to start from square one, which is not easy. To hit
   a balance in exercising, you should adopt an active recovery workout to
   give your muscles time to recover and keep your body strong.

   Rules for creating an active recovery workout

   There are different ways to stay active during an active recovery, but
   here are some guidelines that will help you choose your activities
   wisely.

   Choose a lightweight and non-taxing exercise

   The importance of light exercises is purely to stimulate the recovery
   process without adding stress on the torn muscles. The movements should
   feel fluid and relaxed, but if you feel that the exercise is straining
   you, it means that you are not doing it right. You can use light
   weights, body weight, or resistance band to achieve light intensity
   workouts.

   4-rules-for-creating-an-active-recovery-workout-smart-motivation-ideas2

   Image from https://www.thetimes.co.uk/

   Do multi-joint exercises

   You should choose exercises that involve a full range of motion to
   avoid isolating a group of muscles. This helps every muscle to get
   enough supply of oxygen and nutrients and also stops stiffness and
   soreness. This gives you flexibility and strength to resume your
   exercises.

   Focus on key muscles

   This is the best part of light exercises because you focus on other
   muscles that are not addressed during regular workouts. It helps to
   relax the injured muscles and also keeps you active throughout. You can
   adopt simple cardio exercises if you have been concentrating on
   strength training.

   4-rules-for-creating-an-active-recovery-workout-smart-motivation-ideas0

   Image from https://www.instagram.com/

   Choose exercises that increase blood flow

   The purpose of doing light exercises is to have motion and increase
   circulation throughout the body. Even a simple walk will do you good as
   you wait for your muscles to relax and stop aching.

   Conclusion

   Though the recovery period is supposed to be a time for rest and repair
   of the worn-out tissues, it is not a time to get totally dormant. The
   athlete needs to be active in a reasonable way to help in healing and
   re-energizing, and the above guidelines can help in that. Active rest
   gives you the chance to heal and strengthen your muscles faster than a
   passive rest can give.

How to Be The Pack Leader Your Dog Deserves – Inspiring True Life Wisdom
Facts

   While it is true that most dog owners see their dogs as part of the
   family, which is a healthy approach, we should not forget that they are
   dogs and not humans. This means that they do deserve all our love,
   care, and respect. But, at the same time, we need to respect the way
   they function and see the world. It is wrong to try to humanize a dog,
   as the results are never as expected.

   Dogs are pack animals and they need a leader in order to behave well.
   If they won’t feel that you are a leader, they will attempt to take
   this position, so that the “pack” aka the family, is protected and well
   looked after. You cannot allow this to happen because you will lose
   control of your dog. It will disobey you and will do only what they
   consider appropriate or right. In their eyes, you will be second in
   command in this case, so your orders or requirements will be
   disregarded.

   how-to-be-the-pack-leader-your-dog-deserves-inspiring-true-life-wisdom-
   facts1

   Image from https://www.dogfoodinsider.com

   Another thing worthy of remembering is that all dogs need a pack
   leader, both small and large. Many people don’t see the need to be a
   pack leader for their Chihuahua or Yorkie. But, in spite of their small
   stature and fragile bodies, they are still dogs. Thus, they will need a
   leader to show them the right way and protect them, not the other way
   around.

   How to become a good pack leader for your dog? Take a look at the steps
   listed below and become the pack leader your dog deserves. Bear in mind
   that they need to have a leader, so if you don’t want to take the
   position, your dog will, and that’s not to your advantage.
     * Start by educating yourself

   If you don’t know too much about how dogs function, you will have to
   educate yourself first. You can ask for the help of a dog trainer or
   dog behaviorist. Or you can look for information on the Internet. The
   main idea is that dogs are descendant from wild wolves, so they still
   price a proper pack order. For them, each family member has a certain
   position in the pack. Thus, the entire family will have to be part of
   this, if this is applicable. It doesn’t matter if you are single or
   have a family with children, because there must be a pack leader.

   What you need to bear in mind is that aggressiveness or harshness is
   not needed in order to become a pack leader. On the contrary, you will
   have to be calm, but assertive. You will have to be firm and adopt the
   right kind of attitude. You can very well be a loving leader, guiding
   your dog with a gentle hand. So, don’t think that being tough will also
   make you a good pack leader.

     * Know your dog well

   From the moment you bring your puppy home, you will have to get to know
   it as well as it is possible. You see, dogs are also unique and have
   different personalities. Even puppies coming from the same litter will
   display different character traits. Knowing your dog will give you the
   chance to be the leader it needs for a balanced and happy life.

   Why the character of a dog matters so much? Well, for instance, a shy
   dog will have to be handled with care, calmness, and patience.
   Hyperactive dogs, on the other hand, may require a higher dose of
   firmness from your side.

   facts3

   Image from https://www.dorwest.com/
     * You will have to embrace the posture of pack leader

   In order to be seen as a pack leader, you will have to believe you are
   one. So, you will need to be firm and composed and display the right
   attitude. Dogs are great body language readers and will tell if you are
   insecure or weak. Also, they will tell if you are nervous or anxious as
   well, so try to avoid such states of mind. Instead, do your best to be
   calm, stable, and secure on your actions and reactions. Of course,
   don’t forget about kindness, love, and affection, which are so needed
   by your dog.

   facts4

   Image from https://www.doghowto.com/
     * The boundaries will have to be clearly set right from the start

   It is not recommended to allow the dog to do whatever it wants. If you
   don’t want it to sleep in your bed or on the couch, you should make
   these boundaries clear. You should show the dog who owns the territory.
   This is not a sign that you don’t love the dog. It just shows the dog
   who is the leader. Plus the set boundaries will help you both live in
   harmony and peace.

   facts5

   Image from https://www.akc.org/

   When it comes to dogs, you will have to do this with the help of body
   language. They can’t understand what you’re saying, but will definitely
   understand what your body is saying. If you want to transmit a message
   to your dog, establish eye contact and adopt the right position. You
   will see that it will understand what your intention is. Of course, if
   you’re having just a puppy, it may not get it right away, as puppies
   are just like children. But, as it will grow, it will understand you
   better.
     * Give your dog tasks and responsibilities

   In a pack, every member has a clear role to play. This is for the
   well-being of the entire pack, of course.  What kind of tasks or work
   can you give your dog? Well, because it is more a companion than a
   worker, you will have to give it toys, walk it, play with it, and go
   through obedience training. A dog will feel much better when you will
   assign it tasks and will give it the chance to burn its energy in one
   way or another. Just like humans, dogs also need mental and physical
   stimulation, on a daily basis.

   With this information in hand, you are more than ready to become a pack
   leader. Of course, additional research and education are always
   welcome. If you’re looking to get a dog soon and you’re not sure what
   dog breed to choose, do check out Charlotte Dog Club. This online
   platform collaborates with reliable dog breeders only and will
   guarantee the quality and health of the puppies. Also, the variety of

3 Key Tips for Keeping Wardrobe Shopping Under Budget

   People spend a lot of money on clothes because outfits are important.
   The outfits allow us to showcase our personality. They also empower us
   and boost our confidence. But that does not mean that you should spend
   more money on wardrobe than you can afford.

   Looking stylish and fashionable is nothing to do with a number of
   clothes in your wardrobe. It is all about knowing what to wear and when
   to wear. If you are smart shopper you can make an adult Christmas
   onesie look stylish as well.

   Here are a few tips that can help you in creating a balanced wardrobe.

   Get a Second Opinion:

   If you want to control the wardrobe shopping budget then you need to
   figure out where you are overspending. When it comes to clothes, it is
   hard, to be honest with ourselves. We love everything we buy and we do
   not want to throw it away. If you want to stop overspending then you
   need an honest second opinion. You can always invite your honest friend
   while spring cleaning. It will help in determining which clothes are a
   good part of the wardrobe and which ones are total wastes. You can use
   the opinion during the next shopping trip. It will restrain you from
   buying colors and styles that do not suit you.

   Categorizing:

   When you are cleaning the wardrobe you need to divide the clothing
   items into different categories. Create three piles. In the first pile,
   you should put the clothes that you do not want. In the second put the
   clothes that you do not wear anymore. The third pile is for the ones
   that you do not need. The final pile is for the ones you keep.

   If you are having difficulty in categorizing you should consider
   following things:
     * When was the last time you wore it?
     * Do you have more than one of those things in your closet?
     * Do you feel comfortable wearing it?
     * Does it fit?
     * Does it go with more than three items in your closet?

   These questions are perfect for determining whether a certain clothing
   item is a keeper or not.

   What is lacking:

   After you clean out the wardrobe, you are ready for the shopping list.
   You need to determine which outfits the wardrobe needs. It is never a
   good idea to go shopping without a plan. It makes it easy to get
   carried away by new and fancy trends. If you have a shopping list you
   will stay focused. You do not want to waste your wardrobe budget on
   mindless purchases. It is important that you have a balanced wardrobe.
   It makes sure that you always have something nice and fashionable to
   wear, no matter what the occasion. If you have a great pair of jeans
   but lack good t-shirts to pair with it, then you should get some
   t-shirts.

   Keep these things in mind and you will be able to build a great
   wardrobe. You can always give the clothes you do not need to charity or
   thrift stores so you have a zero waste wardrobe.

How To Make Your Dog Love You – True Facts to Live Your Life Happy With Pet

   One of the most beautiful moments in life is when another soul enters
   our home. A dog brings about peace and tranquility. Many have stated
   that having a dog can be very therapeutic. Dogs are truly affectionate
   creatures. But what if the dog that you’re introducing to your home has
   already reached adulthood and formed attachments? Socializing and
   interaction might be more difficult than you think.

   There is no one-size-fits-them-all approach when it comes to dogs
   because each race is different and every dog is unique. If you want to
   win a dog’s love you’ll need to invest time and a bit of effort.

   You could start by trying to understand your dog and to know his needs.
   If you give him the loving care that he needs and do things that he
   loves, he will eventually warm up to you.

   Win your dog’s trust by creating a strong bond between the two of you.

   Regardless of your dog’s personality, you must act like a leader that
   he can look up to. Your Maltese puppy, for instance, will still need
   someone to be supported by, even if it’s a fearless creature that will
   do anything in its power to protect you.

   Keep a close eye on him and notice what he likes and what he doesn’t
   like. The more time you spend with him doing things that he likes, the
   stronger the bond between the two of you will be.


Dogs are known to be one of the most active animal species on Earth

   They absolutely love the outdoors and don’t really enjoy staying
   indoors for long periods of time. They simply aren’t made for a
   sedentary lifestyle, so you should really make an effort to take him
   out for a walk. This is beneficial for his overall well-being and the
   bond between the two of you. Don’t forget to use a leash when taking
   him out for a walk in order to avoid conflicts with other stray dogs.
   Also, choose an anti-flea leash, so that your dog doesn’t bring
   unexpected guests back home.

Dogs need to be mentally stimulated

   Training them is an efficient method to nurture their lust for life and
   agility. Dog training works for any breed. There are some specific
   techniques that you must apply for him to learn that it’s not OK to
   jump on people or stray out of sight. Dogs with a higher-than-average
   IQ can be trained to do more complex tasks. That’s why the police or
   other government institutions use dogs for search and rescue
   operations. Try to teach your dog one little trick a week. You could
   start by teaching him simple commands and progress towards more
   complicated tasks. This will make him happy and loyal towards you.


Reward him when he does something right

   Professional trainers know that the best method to encourage an animal
   to behave in a certain way is to give him small rewards every time he
   listens to you or correctly executes a trick. Thus, your dog will learn
   to associate that action with receiving a reward. Feed him foods that
   are rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. Be extra careful when you
   feed him off your table. Some foods are toxic for dogs.


Allow him to sleep in bed with you from time to time

   An animal that is attached to you will want to spend as much time as
   possible with you. If you try to isolate him in another room, he might
   get sad. However, if you don’t want him to constantly sleep in bed next
   to you, you can let him do it only occasionally. He will then view it
   as a reward.

Be gentle with him

   As any other pet, dogs can get depressed if treated badly. If you often
   punish him, yell at him, or worst, use physical violence against him,
   not only will you train him to do naughty things, but your dog will
   start fearing you. An anxious dog is much more predisposed to heart
   disease, digestive or respiratory problems. Thus, you should avoid
   being abusive in any way, even verbally.

   Follow these tips and it’ll be easier to create a loving bond with your
   dog. You will come to understand the full meaning of why dog is man’s
   best friend.

When a dog loves you, he will become annoying in an adorable way.


   He will constantly come after you, jump on your lap and make you want
   to play with him. He does this because he feels comfortable with you
   and loves your company.

   One of the most obvious signs of affection is when he starts licking
   you. In the moment that your four-legged friend jumps on you and licks
   you, he’s telling you that he loves you. While it may not be very
   hygienic, it’s his way of showing you love.

   You will be greeted with enthusiastic jumps and happy howls when you
   arrive home. There are few things in life that can match the love seen
   in a dog’s eyes when his master comes home.

   When you’re out, your four-legged friend will act like a bodyguard,
   always hanging by your side and defending you from any perceived
   threat.

   If your dog is displaying at least some of the behaviors mentioned
   above, odds are that you’ve won his/her heart. Don’t worry if he
   doesn’t immediately warm up to you. Just treat him right, be
   considerate and both of you will be happy.
