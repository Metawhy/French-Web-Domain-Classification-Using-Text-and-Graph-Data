   5dfa6bd89460947573c61613a3058a2d2c028e] Barsys

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

Google may have taken a step towards quantum computing 'supremacy'

   Or maybe not -- the paper has been unpublished and its results are
   disputed.

   Barsys $1,500 robot bartender promises cocktails with AI precision
   You can control the home bar with up to three devices at a time.
   Christine Fisher, 07.18.19

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

   Barsys $1,500 robot bartender promises cocktails with AI precision
   You can control the home bar with up to three devices at a time.
   Christine Fisher, 07.18.19

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

   [gemini.png]

   With a slew of updates on the horizon, the Oculus Quest ($399) is now a
   must-have purchase for anyone getting into VR. Today's Oculus Connect 6
   keynote was jam-packed with major new features for the Quest: Oculus
   Link will let it connect to PCs and play any Rift title; hand-tracking
   is coming next year; and it's even getting Go apps and better
   passthrough support. All of this begs the question, what purpose does
   the Rift S ($399) serve now? Not much, I'd say.

   The Rift S had a rocky start. It launched alongside the Quest, but
   while that headset gave us a glimpse at the power of truly portable VR,
   the Rift S just felt like a minor step up from the original Rift. Sure,
   the resolution was higher and had built-in sensors, but it wasn't the
   true sequel I was hoping for. Instead, it felt like yet another PC VR
   headset, one that was practically indistinguishable from the slew of
   Windows Mixed Reality devices.

   Oculus

   With Oculus Link and all of those updates coming to the Quest, the Rift
   S now seems practically irrelevant. My main issue with the Quest
   originally was that it was limited to simpler mobile VR experiences,
   but Oculus Link completely fixes that problem. If it works as
   advertised, you just have to plug it into a gaming PC to play higher
   quality Rift titles, like the upcoming Asgard's Wrath. That's not only
   incredibly convenient, it's something we haven't yet seen from a major
   VR company. Finally, there's a headset that you can use wirelessly on
   the go, and together with a PC when you need more power.

   The Quest also has higher resolution OLED displays (1,440 by 1,600
   pixels per eye) than the Rift S (1,280 by 1,440 pixels per eye), which
   relies on fast-switching LCDs. The Rift S does have the advantage of a
   slightly faster 80Hz refresh rate, but the Quest isn't much slower at
   72Hz. I'd argue the benefits of OLED outweigh that deficiency: You'll
   see deeper black levels and better overall contrast on the Quest.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VkO-Kc3vks

   And if you're not sold on the benefits of the Quest yet, there's also
   hand tracking coming next year. We only saw a brief demo at Oculus
   Connect, but it looks like it does a decent job of sensing your
   individual finger movements using the Quest's built-in cameras and
   computer vision algorithms. There's no additional accessory required.
   It's unclear if the Rift S will ever get this feature — though it
   technically could. While hand tracking might not replace the Quest's
   motion controllers altogether, it adds another immersive interaction
   option for developers. It also gives Oculus one way to compete with the
   Valve Index, which has excellent finger tracking controllers.

   As if to rub salt in the wound, Oculus is also bringing Passthrough+,
   one of the Rift S's unique capabilities, over to the Quest. It gives
   you a stereoscopic view of the real world using the headset's cameras,
   and it's vastly superior to the flat 2D version of Passthrough
   currently on the Quest. This isn't necessarily an essential feature,
   but being able to sense the actual distance between you and your coffee
   table will likely help avoid potential VR accidents.

   With both the Oculus Quest and Rift S selling for $399, the choice for
   most consumers is obvious: Go for the more flexible and capable
   headset, instead of the one that's stuck in the past. I wouldn't be
   surprised if Oculus ends up making the Rift S cheaper for the holidays,
   but it would have to be a truly steep discount to make it worthwhile.

   As of today, you can purchase PS4 consoles, physical games and
   accessories directly from Sony. The company has just launched its own
   dedicated store, meaning you'll no longer be directed to retailers like
   GameStop. Unfortunately, goods will only be available to consumers in
   the US. But Sony says the store will help fans around the world
   discover products and compare the prices of other retailers.

   You'll find everything from PS4, PS4 Pro and PS VR systems and bundles
   to headsets, DualShock 4 Wireless Controllers and select physical
   games. The initial titles include Bloodborne, Days Gone, God of War 3
   Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition and more.

   PlayStation Plus members will be eligible for free one-day express
   shipping, and as a launch promotion, Sony is offering two bundles -- a
   PlayStation 4 and a 12-month PS Plus subscription for $400, or a
   PlayStation 4 Pro and a 12-month PS Plus subscription for $430. That
   deal ends on October 31st and can be found at Sony's website.

   Darth Vader is back. In a surprise announcement on Wednesday at
   Facebook's annual Oculus Connect conference, LucasFilm's ILMxLAB shared
   new details on Vader Immortal: Episode II. The new game picks up
   exactly where Episode I left off, with you, a Force-sensitive smuggler,
   learning how to use the Force from Vader himself. From a gameplay
   perspective, this means you'll have new abilities to use in combat.
   Like any good Sith apprentice, you'll be able to pick up and toss both
   objects and individuals, as well as throw your lightsabre at enemies.
   The Force will also come into play when you need to solve puzzles.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qCQLs1QpXI

   Both Maya Rudolph and Scott Lawrence return to reprise their roles as
   ZO-E3 and Darth Vader respectively. What's more, the story is once
   again penned by Blade and The Dark Knight scribe David Goyer. Once
   you've finished the main story, there's a new Lightsabre Dojo mode that
   integrates the gameplay enhancements from the main game.

   The best part is that if you own an Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift, you
   can download Vader Immortal: Episode II for $9.99 right now. When
   Engadget's Devindra Hardawar played Episode I, he came away impressed
   by the experience but did say he would have liked the combat to be more
   involved. Based on what we've seen of Vader Immortal: Episode II, it
   looks like ILMxLAB has tried to address those concerns.

   2e9fefc47918108784b8357b232425b37638e] Respawn / Oculus

   When Steven Spielberg approached DreamWorks Interactive with his idea
   for a WWII video game (after wrapping Saving Private Ryan), even he
   couldn't have predicted the franchise's success. More than a dozen
   Medal of Honor games were released on 11 platforms between 1999 and
   2012. After an eight year hiatus, Medal of Honor returns in 2020 on the
   Oculus Rift with an extreme take on first-person shooters.

   asd

   Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond spans the length of the second World
   War across three acts, Peter Hirschmann, director at Respawn, told the
   assembled group of reporters at a demo event held in San Francisco last
   week.

   Act One focuses your efforts on helping the French Underground resist
   and sabotage invading Nazi forces. In the demo level, I played as an
   actual historical member of the Resistance. Disguised as a Nazi foot
   soldier, I had to infiltrate an occupied French town, search a
   semi-destroyed home for a secret code and then coordinate an assault on
   the local fascist forces using a repurposed Mozart record before
   exfiltrating the town in a series of running firefights.

   Act Two is all about the invasion of Normandy and assaulting German
   strongpoints on the road back to Berlin. There was no sneaking or
   sabotage in this demo level, just the systematic execution of dozens of
   Nazi soldiers occupying a French hotel as I searched for a captured
   list of Allied spies. Act Three is especially wild with missions to
   assault the Nazi's heavy water production facility in Norway and their
   secret V-3 testing grounds.

   The graphics are impressive, running at 90FPS without a hint of the
   screen door effect. In fact, Hirschmann points out that a single
   uniform model in this game contains more data than the entirety of the
   first MoH for the PS1. I only felt minor motion sickness once during
   the game but that happened while I was in the process of falling down
   the side of a Norwegian cliff after accidentally stepping off a narrow
   bridge.

   asdf

   Similarly, every German actor hired for the game is a native speaker of
   the language and the production team spent countless hours recording
   actual WWII weapons and vehicles to make the SFX as accurate as
   possible. The storylines and map layouts are no different. Respawn
   interviewed dozens of WWII vets, getting their input on everything from
   troop movements to location layouts to their impressions and
   experiences during the War. The team, working with the Honor Flight
   Network, even flew a number of vets back out to France for the first
   time since Armistice Day to have them walk the team through their
   exploits at the very spots where they occurred.

   But for Respawn's work in ensuring the game is historically accurate,
   the value proposition of the game is straightforward: shoot, stab, and
   punch Nazis until they stop getting back up. It's a noble pursuit, to
   be sure, but one that is hampered by the games controls. Hirschmann
   spoke at length about the team's efforts to make the game as immersive
   as possible and how a VR platform (and the Rift S controllers) empower
   them to do so.

   For example, in any other MoH game, you reload your sidearm by tapping
   a single controller button. In "Above and Beyond," you'll wish it were
   that easy. Now, you hit a button on the right controller to expel the
   spent magazine, reach down to your waist with your left controller,
   grab a replacement mag, slam it into the pistol's receiver, then pull
   back the slide to chamber a round. That's sounds like a lot of work
   because it is and it's even more harrowing when you've got a Nazi death
   squad pouring automatic fire onto your position. I assume the movement
   becomes second nature after a while but during my short playthrough it
   resulted in me being dead more often than not. Yes, it's more realistic
   but it is also a deeply frustrating way to start a game.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARC4_Rp01-U

   I also found that sighting down the barrel, which requires a two-handed
   grip on the weapon, to be quite trying. Sure, you're not tracking a
   crosshair around the screen with your left thumbstick, but pretending
   to hold a simulated weapon up to your VR ensconced face using a pair of
   controllers that don't feel or handle anything like a rifle is so much
   worse. And if you're trying to sight through a scope, Jesus be with
   you. Lining everything up is damn near impossible.

   What's more, your avatar only has two running speeds: Sunday Stroll and
   Grandpa Doing Laps Around the Mall. Your movement is controlled with
   your hands, which makes aiming and firing while strafing and running
   all that more difficult. It's cool that you control your ducking and
   leaning by actually ducking and leaning but given your glacial pace and
   inability to switch between a left- or right-handed grip on the fly
   makes diving for cover or firing around corners a bit of a crapshoot.

   I'm not saying that the control scheme is unworkable, just that you
   should prepare yourself for a fairly steep initial learning curve.
   Plus, there's a whole bunch of cool stuff that can only be done in a VR
   environment. I'm talking about snagging thrown grenades from mid-air
   and overhand hucking them back at the enemy position, snatching up
   frying pans from kitchen stoves and using them to canoe the skulls of
   your foes, or the immensely satisfying feeling of flicking your boot
   knife down a hallway and into the neck of a Nazi grunt. You have to
   physically flick your wrist just so to really get it sailing.

   asdf

   Overall, "Above and Beyond" looks to be a worthy successor to the Medal
   of Honor lineage. I'm not sold on the controls but with 50 playable
   levels reportedly available at launch, there will be plenty of
   opportunity to practice. The game is slated for release in 2020, though
   no price has been set yet.
