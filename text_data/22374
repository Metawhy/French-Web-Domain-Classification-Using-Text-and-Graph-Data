   FoSSaCS is a member conference of the European Joint Conferences on
   Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS), which is the primary European
   forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics
   relating to Software Science. ETAPS 2009 is the twelfth joint
   conference in this series and will be held in York, United Kindgom. The
   prior conferences have been ETAPS 1998 in Lisbon, ETAPS 1999 in
   Amsterdam, ETAPS 2000 in Berlin, ETAPS 2001 in Genova, ETAPS 2002 in
   Grenoble,  ETAPS 2003 in Warsaw, ETAPS 2004 in Barcelona, ETAPS 2005 in
   Edinburgh, ETAPS 2006 in Vienna, ETAPS 2007 in Minho, and ETAPS 2008 in
   Budapest.

                               CALL FOR PAPERS

   FOSSACS seeks original papers on foundational research with a clear
   significance for software science. The conference invites submissions
   on theories and methods to support the analysis, integration,
   synthesis, transformation, and verification of programs and software
   systems. The specific topics covered by the conference include, but are
   not limited to, the following:
     * Algebraic models,
     * Automata and language theory,
     * Behavioural equivalences,
     * Categorical models,
     * Computation processes over discrete and continuous data,
     * Infinite state systems,
     * Computation structures,
     * Logics of programs,
     * Modal, spatial, and temporal logics,
     * Models of concurrent, reactive, distributed, and mobile systems,
     * Process algebras and calculi,
     * Semantics of programming languages,
     * Software specification and refinement,
     * Type systems and type theory.
     * Fundamentals of security
     * Semi-structured data
     * Program correctness and verification

   As FoSSaCS addresses a heterogeneous audience, potential authors are
   strongly encouraged to write about their ideas and findings in general
   and jargon-independent, rather than in application- and
   domain-specific, terms.

                               IMPORTANT DATES

   ETAPS 2009 conferences and other satellite events will be held March
   22-29, 2009.
   As a part of ETAPS, FoSSaCS adheres to ETAPS submission and
   notification deadlines:

     Thursday, October 2, 2008 Submission of abstracts (extended till 1pm,
   PST, October 3: see note)

     Thursday, October 9, 2008 ( Samoa time, GMT-11) Strict deadline for
   submission of full versions.

     Friday, December 12, 2008 Acceptance notification of authors

     Monday, January 5, 2009 Camera-ready paper versions due

     March 22-29, 2009  FoSSaCS 2009 Conference

   The paper submission deadline is STRICT. Making the deadline for
   submission of abstracts a week early allows the programme committee to
   start work before full versions are available. Obviously, there is no
   need to wait with submission of the full version until the final
   deadline.

   Submission of an abstract implies no obligation to submit a full
   version; abstracts with no corresponding full versions by the final
   deadline will be treated as withdrawn, but authors are strongly
   encouraged, in this case, to explicitly withdraw their submission by
   sending an e-mail to the chairman.

                            SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

   Research papers cover one or more of the topics above and are evaluated
   by the FoSSaCS Program Committee. Submitted research papers must:
     * be in English and have a maximum of 15 pages (including figures and
       bibliography). Additional material intended for the referee but not
       for publication in the final version - for example details of
       proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not
       included in the page limit,
     * present original research which is unpublished and not submitted
       elsewhere (conferences, journals, books,...) -- in particular,
       simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS
       conferences is forbidden.
     * use the Springer-Verlag LNCS style.
     * be submitted electronically in PDF via the FoSSaCS 2009 Conference
       Service

   Submissions deviating from these instructions may be rejected without
   review. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is
   accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the
   presentation. The proceedings of the conference will be published in
   the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Final
   papers will be in the format specified by Springer-Verlag. Please note
   that FOSSACS does not accept tool demonstration papers. Any questions
   regarding the submission guidelines should be directed to the Program
   Committee Chair Luca de Alfaro prior to submitting.
