   “It took us less than a week to become comfortable with AHV. AHV is a
   simple solution with everything we need displayed in one console, and
   we love the one-click non-disruptive upgrades."

   “If we could use one word to describe the benefits brought by Nutanix,
   that would be ’trouble-free’. The virtual environment in the past
   relied on manual operation, which would normally take two days to
   deliver. But now, only one hour to two hours are needed to complete the
   same workload.”

   “It took us less than a week to become comfortable with AHV. AHV is a
   simple solution with everything we need displayed in one console, and
   we love the one-click non-disruptive upgrades."

   “If we could use one word to describe the benefits brought by Nutanix,
   that would be ’trouble-free’. The virtual environment in the past
   relied on manual operation, which would normally take two days to
   deliver. But now, only one hour to two hours are needed to complete the
   same workload.”
