   ViTE is a trace explorer. It is a tool to visualize execution traces in
   Pajé or OTF format for debugging and profiling parallel or distributed
   applications. It is an open source software licenced under CeCILL-A.

   A powerful profiling tool
          At a glance checks the progress of your parallel program. Each
          kind of program state is drawn with its own color helping you to
          find quickly bottleneck, idle states and phases that can be
          optimized.

   A powerful debugging tool
          Easily find what the different threads of execution were doing
          when your program crashes. Quickly localize dead-clocks.

   A fast rendering
          Explore huge traces fluently thanks to OpenGL which operates
          graphical hardware acceleration. ViTE provides this graphic tool
          and makes you win a precious time.

   Fast and intuitive
          Use common mouse and keyboard shortcuts so you do not need to
          consult the help menu. Getting started quickly is one of the
          ViTE foundations. Icons are easily understandable.

   Informative parser and images export
          ViTE parser is robust. When parsing a non-compliant trace ViTE
          displays what it can and a list of the errors. Current export
          file formats are SVG (vectorial), PNG and JPEG. You can choose
          to export the current view or set the time interval.

   Cross-platform
          You can use ViTE on many systems:

          + GNU/Linux
          + MacOS X
          + Windows
