hello, i’m jayde

So nice to e-meet you! I’m an Aussie living in Switzerland (often seen riding
my pink bike past our local castle) and on a journey to live a more
meaningful and happy life.

   As a minimalist who wears more pink than black and white, an everyday
   girl trying to live my most eco-friendly life (I’m a proud outfit
   repeater and capsule wardrobe addict) and a blogger who openly shares
   resources and knowledge (test me out – send me an email or DM me on
   Instagram), I hope to give you that little (or big) nudge you need to
   chase your wildest dreams – especially when they push the boundaries.
