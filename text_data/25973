League of European Research Universities

   23 leading universities pushing the frontiers of innovative research

The LERU network

   The League of European Research Universities (LERU) is a prominent
   advocate for the promotion of basic research at European research
   universities. We strongly believe that frontier research plays an
   essential role in the innovation process and significantly contributes
   to the progress of society.

   We aim at furthering politicians’, policy makers’ and opinion leaders’
   understanding of the important role and activities of
   research-intensive universities. Our 23 members bring together
   representatives to work on LERU policy development and engage in mutual
   learning in many areas.
