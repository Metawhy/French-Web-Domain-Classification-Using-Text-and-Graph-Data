   Player and RealPlayer plugin browser plugins.

   Ballmer pleasing its shareholders ..
   Screenshot from KMPlayer 0.9.1, controlpanel will shift up
   when moving the mouse near bottom of video
   so you can peek in playlist for eg. bookmarking a specific URL
   Highlights are
     * play movies from file/url using MPlayer, Xine (with ^*kxineplayer)
       or GStreamer (with ^*kgstplayer), making the plugin support as many
       as possible and, because all three are embedded external programs,
       keeping konqueror from crashing,
     * keep movie sizes ratio
     * volume slider using backend players' volume control and a volume
       slider using kmix or sound mixer applet (kicker) in the pop-down
       menu,
     * position slider
     * Javascript support for controlling the plugin from web page's
       javascript, and of course preventing script errors on pages calling
       these functions,
     * 'Click to Play' support for QuickTime's href attribute,
     * lots of attributes supported, AUTOSTART, FULLSCREENMODE, CONSOLE,
       CONTROLS etc. Also, the CONSOLE/CONTROLS for RealPlayer plugin,
       allows KMPlayer to 'split-up' over multible objects,
     * bookmark menu in the popup menu, so you can easily bookmark a
       stream for later w/o having to visit the web site all the time,
     * support for typical used playlist formats as ASX, RAM, m3u, pls,
       partially SMIL and multi-media links in podcast RSS or ATOM feeds
       and a dockable viewer for it. This allows you to easy navigate or
       bookmark certain streams.
     * recording using mencoder, mplayer -dumpstream, Xine's mrl extension
       or ffmpeg
     * resize/fullscreen support
     * proxy settings from konqueror are used to set http_proxy
       environment variable for backend processes,
     * configurable pattern matching for MPlayer and easy Xine
       configuration editor

   The stand-alone player (libkdeinit_kmplayer.so) shares its core
   (libkmplayercommon.so) with the plugin's (libkmplayerpart.so) one,
   keeping both plugin and stand-alone player as lean (and secure) as
   possible. Actually, I wouldn't be suprised if the majority of KMPlayer
   users only use the plugin and use one of the other great movie players
   for KDE for other means.
   The stand-alone application can additionally:
     * play DVD (DVDNav only with the Xine player)
     * play VCD
     * let the backend players play from a pipe (read from stdin), using a
       seperate process (not piping to kmplayer itself)
     * play from a TV device (experimental)
     * show backend player's console output
     * launch ffserver (only 0.4.8 works) when viewing from a v4l device
     * DCOP KMediaPlayer interface support
     * VDR viewer frontend (with ^*kxvplayer), configure VDR keys with
       standard KDE shortcut configure window
     * Lots of configurable shortcuts. Highly recommended for the VDR keys
       (if you have VDR) and volume increase/decrease.
     * Simple XML editor that make the XML under the current selected node
       editable and allows you to sync it back at that point in the tree

   ^*backend players that come with KMPlayer. These players are simple
   command line applications (xsreensaver compatible) that embed inside
   KMPlayer. Communication is done using DCOP.

Help wanted

   Some things simply stay low on my priority list, simply because I don't
   need it right now. Anyway, if you like to contribute to KMPlayer, have
   a look at this:
     * Fix the debian build, don't end with an error, make kmplayer
       package a real meta package of -lib, -plugin and -app.
     * Improve the GStreamer backend (kgstplayer), audio visualisations,
       dvdnav, flash, etc. Note, flash already works with the gstswfdec
       plugin. Unfortunately it performs not very well. Fixing this would
       allow kmplayer to replace the binary only flash plugin for
       konqueror.
     * MEncoder/FFMpeg encoding options.
     * A new name, KMPlayer sounds like a frontend to MPlayer, no?
     * Mute feature.
     * Improve the TV playback. Currently device scanning is done using
       MPlayer, but should be done more reliable (eg. HAL or XVideo).
       Channel scanning is nice of course. Maybe an extra backend, like
       tvtime.
