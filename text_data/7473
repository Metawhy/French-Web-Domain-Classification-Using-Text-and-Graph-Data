Le Tote

   I've got a secret.
   I wear clothes that aren't mine.
   Clothes I can't afford to buy.
   I give them back without washing them.
   Then I do it all over again.
   You can too!
   I'm talking about Le Tote. A friend introduced me to it, and I'm so
   glad she did. I'm currently wearing a top that retails for $99. I can't
   think of any piece of clothing I've ever paid $99 for, except my
   wedding dress. It was hard to get a photo of my favorite feature of
   this top, the zippered shoulders and the duck tailed back. From the
   front it just looks like a regular old flannel. That feather bracelet?
   Also Le Tote.
   [Letote%2B334.jpg]
   After you make an account, you browse their clothes, bags, and
   accessories online and add the ones you like to your "closet". Le Tote
   then styles a tote for you and sends it to you in a box like this.
   Shipping is free (both ways) and fast. They are based out of San
   Francisco. There is a prepaid shipping bag in the box, and after you
   wear the clothes you simply drop them in the bag and back into the
   mail. Do this as often as you want to get the most for your money.
   They will then style your next tote and send it out. You rate the items
   they send you on your style and the fit. It's like Netflix for clothes.
   Variety without the price tag.
   My biggest closet problem is that I have no variety. Seriously, I own 8
   of the same black tank tops. This way I get to try things that I'd
   probably never think to buy. You can also tell them what not to send
   you. I opted out of earrings, but have kept everything else open.
   If you fall in love with something and want to keep it, you just don't
   return that item in the bag and Le Tote will charge you the price
   listed. The best part is that they do the laundering. We are entering
   into sweater season, which means hand wash sweaters. Insert horrid face
   emoji here.
   If you know an event is coming up, simply add a nice dress and fun
   accessories into your closet. You review your tote and can replace
   items they pick for you before you finalize your tote. Weddings,
   holiday parties, special events? Done and done!
   It costs $49 a month if you add the insurance (which I did). That way
   if you stain something, it is covered. There are no commitments or
   contracts, you can cancel it anytime. This was key to me signing up, I
   don't dig contracts. If you decide you want to try it (even just for a
   month!) you can use my referral link to get $25 off the first month.

Embracing the Ordinary

   A normal Thursday.
   Remnants of yesterday's mascara.
   Changing pajama pants for yoga pants, in hopes that I'll actually DO
   yoga before I find time for a shower.
   Waking up to a house with no half-n-half. The horror.
   A restless night because of last night's all night thunderstorm keeping
   me awake.
   Sleep deprived spelling lesson.
   Botany. Today's lesson is on pollination. Call me crazy, but I think
   the children of beekeepers have this lesson down.
   French, year 2, but 5th and 6th grade version.
   History, reading through The Egypt Game after spending weeks studying
   Egypt.
   Math, supposedly their self-contained computer lesson, but where one
   child insists that you sit next to her in case she needs help. She
   solves the problems in her head faster than you do, showing her math
   wizardry that she likes to hide, so you can sit next to her.
   Three loads of clean laundry on the bench at the end of your bed, but
   hey, at least they've made the journey from the dryer to inside the
   house, no small feat.
   An as yet unmade bed, which I hate, because I like crawling into an
   organized bed at night. Maybe by not making it I'm just keeping my
   options open for crawling back in it.
   Chickens needing fed, in the rain.
   A garden to check. See what other growth my dearly beloved gopher has
   eaten or dug up.
   A bathroom sink perpetually covered in toothpaste.
   A checkbook in need of balancing.
   On and on it goes.
   And that's OK.
   I'm feeling this new wave come over me.
   I don't have to get it all done, and newsflash, even if I do, I will
   get to do it all again tomorrow. Life exists in a long string of
   ordinary days. Some are better than others, like the ones that involve
   chocolate, adventure, or marveling at something new and amazing. Most
   are this, a sequence of ordinary events that don't seem like much to us
   in the moment, but add them all up and they equal the sum of our lives.
   There is nothing new here, no wow factor. Just a personal light bulb
   and resolve. I plan on joyfully embracing the ordinary moments, fun and
   not so fun (laundry, never ending dishes, I'm looking at you).
   For some people that I am very close to, their lives do not have as
   much joy as they once held. It breaks my heart in ways I never knew
   possible. I've watched as they were awarded this lesson before me
   though, and I took notice. They have learned to embrace the ordinary.
   The small, good things that come to them on ordinary days, are really
   not small to them at all. String them together, and they get a measure
   of joy most of us take for granted.
   I'm becoming more mindful of moving through my ordinary days with eyes
   and heart wide open, not to Pollyanna over the hard stuff, but to grow
   from it.
   To dig deep.
   To offer much.
   To make myself low.
   I want to celebrate with you on the extraordinary days, and climb into
   the pit with you on the bad days. I want to listen to understand, not
   to solve.
   I want to love.
   And I want to love in the ordinary ways on ordinary days, even when the
   ocean is no where in sight.

Final thoughts on the life-changing magic of tidying up

   Though reading The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, we started
   sorting my daughters' clothes. After seeing how good it felt to clear
   out the old clothes they'd no longer wear, they started slowly deciding
   on their own certain things they didn't like about their spaces.
   [sept2015%2B022.jpg]
   Emma decided that she no longer liked having a bunk bed, and having to
   touch bars when she rolls over at night. Also, now that she and her
   sister always sleep in separate rooms, the bottom bunk is almost always
   empty. Once you go through one category of your belongings (clothes)
   and ask yourself what brings you joy, you start to notice all of the
   things in other categories that don't bring you joy.
   That is how we started the process of re-doing the girls' rooms. I've
   shared a couple of before pictures, and below I'll share some afters.
   [sept2015%2B048.jpg]
   After painting my mom's house, we knew we LOVED the Classic Silver
   paint color from Behr, so that's what we used. If it ain't broke, don't
   fix it.
   Emma chose this beautiful painting from Hobby Lobby (50% off) as the
   base of her room.
   [sept2015%2B067.jpg]
   We put a cabinet she previously had in her room, in an unused side of
   her closet to make space. We are all about the space now. She picked
   out a fluffy butterfly chair from Target for her reading spot.
   [sept2015%2B058.jpg]
   The white headboard is from Target.com and I bought it during a Labor
   Day sale, plus got free shipping with my RedCard Debit, and an extra 5%
   off. Same goes for the bedding. She didn't really like any of the
   in-store bedding, but they offer a lot more online.
   [sept2015%2B123.jpg]
   I always wonder when I see blogs of picture perfect rooms, where is the
   kid stuff? Hate to burst your bubble, but don't feel bad that your home
   doesn't look like that perfectly blogged home. Bloggers adjust the
   things in the photo, omitting the things that aren't pretty, to get the
   perfect shot. Sorry, but I'm not paid to blog, this is just for fun, so
   I'm going to show you what's behind that perfect photo...LEGOS! Lots of
   Legos!
   Just so you know, my children are not mutants, they still have kids'
   things that they treasure dearly. (No offense to the very talented
   professional bloggers, that is their job, and so they need to show the
   best photos they can.)
   [sept2015%2B128.jpg]
   [sept2015%2B130.jpg]
   She LOVES to spend time in her room now, and I'm so happy that she has
   a more age-appropriate space.
   [sept2015%2B134.jpg]
   *************************
   Now onto Cami's room, which we actually did first.
   [sept2015%2B027.jpg]
   At one point, a couple of years ago, we let the paint "murals" on their
   walls. Yikes. Their rooms have been hodge-podge ever since.
   [sept2015%2B029.jpg]
   My mom and the kids helped paint both rooms.
   [sept2015%2B031.jpg]
   Cami's new mint green bedding was a clearance find at Target.
   Eventually I'd like to order her a gray tufted headboard like Emma's,
   but since her bed is a queen size, it is more expensive. We're
   stockpiling our yard sale pile for one GIANT yard sale in October, and
   then she'll get to finish her room off with a head board.
   [sept2015%2B038.jpg]
   The teal butterfly chair is from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I can't
   remember what I went in for, but this was a happy, accidental find! The
   popcorn pillow is from Kirkland's, because if you know this child at
   all, you know she LIVES for popcorn. Both of the girls' bedside tables
   were clearance finds from TJ Maxx, for $16 each! She already had the
   white Ikea rug, and the white stool came from the living room.
   [sept2015%2B030.jpg]
   Even the beautiful canvas that she loves was a clearance find at
   Target. We all love their spaces SO much more now, and the child who
   always had a problem keeping her room clean, now keeps it up
   beautifully!
   *******************
   My final thoughts on this book are:
   ~Is the reason I'm not good at properly cleaning my house because I
   have far TOO much to care for?
   ~If I care so much about my stuff, why don't I care enough to keep it
   clean?
   ~Would it really be covered in dust if it truly brought me joy?
   ~Is the reason people "don't have enough storage space" simply that
   they are storing far too much?
   Don't misunderstand me.
   Things are not of real value.
   Relationships are.
   Love is.
   Generosity is.
   My point, and what I've taken from this book is that if my house is in
   order, and all of the things that don't bring me joy are gone, it will
   leave me free to live how I want to live. Less time spent taking care
   of things that I don't really care about, translates into more time to
   spend with others, help others, serve others, travel. The things that
   do bring me joy.
   I'll leave you with this quote from the book that I wrote in my
   journal:
   "The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how
   you want to live your life."

The Life-Changing Magic

   I started hearing about this book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying
   Up, from various sources and my interest was peaked. What could
   possibly be so life-changing about tidying up? I was skeptical, but
   after hearing about it from so many people, I decided to pick up a copy
   at Barnes & Noble this weekend. I am about 3/4 of the way done with
   reading it, but I've already started my decluttering.
   She explains her history in detail, and how she came to finally develop
   the KonMari method of tidying. I'll admit, some of the things in the
   book are a bit over the top for me, such as thanking inanimate objects
   for a job well done, but I get the idea behind it. For me, I'm not
   going to be talking to my stuff, but it has made me think about things
   differently. I am more mindful. I am thankful that my clothes protect
   my body. If you don't think that clothes have that big of a job, you
   haven't watched Naked and Afraid. And really, if I'm not thankful for
   something, why am I spending my precious time caring for it (picking it
   up, putting it away, maintaining it, cleaning it, thinking about it,
   etc.)
   I think that has been the biggest revelation of this book. That most of
   us have WAY too much stuff, and we can't possibly care about all of it,
   yet we allow it to take up our space, our time, and our mind.
   I've started following her method, and already my house feels a lot
   different.
   Yes, it is a lot of work.
   No, it is not like any decluttering you've ever done.
   Her method is different, in that it doesn't ask you to do it gradually,
   or by room, etc. You go by category, and you save the memento category
   for last, because it is the hardest. By the time you get to the memento
   category, you should be good at her method, and ready to part with
   things that no longer bring you joy or what she calls a "thrill of
   pleasure".
   This has been pretty eye-opening. Say you received a gift two years ago
   from a loved one. You didn't like or couldn't use the gift for whatever
   reason, but you've saved it all this time. It has probably even
   bothered you that you have it, yet haven't been able to use it.
   It actually brings you guilt.
   Are you tracking with me?
   When they gave you the gift, you certainly felt joy that they actually
   thought to give you a gift. Do you think the giver would like you to
   hold onto something you can't use for years and have that guilt in the
   back of your mind? No. It has fulfilled its purpose of bringing you
   joy, and now you are done with it.
   The same goes for those mountains of cards we tend to save forever. If
   you are going through your cards to sort which will be discarded, she
   doesn't say you need to get rid of every last card, but simply hold
   each one in your hand (this applies to everything) and only keep the
   ones that still bring you that thrill of pleasure. Saving things
   forever that once made us happy, will amount to a whole lot of stuff
   that we will have to care for, move around, organize, etc.
   I'm less than a week in, and since she has you start with the easiest
   category, clothing, you should SEE my closet! I have never seen my
   closet like this, not even when we first moved in to this house. Her
   instructions on folding clothes so that they stand up in drawers? Magic
   in itself.
   I have empty cupboards.
   Hear me, empty cupboards.
   This has never happened to me. This is the magic she talks about that
   ensures her clients never rebound.
   I will freely admit, it is a mess and a lot of work to restart your
   life in this way. The thought of getting to the komono (which is
   basically a miscellaneous category) has me all , but I will do it
   because I am seeing the magic. I will have so much more time when there
   is so much less to pick up and put away.
   This book has also made me rethink when I want to buy something and
   bring it into my house. Do I love it enough to care for it long term?
   I haven't even come close to describing her method, because you really
   need to read the book for yourself, so don't jump in based on this blog
   post, because you will rebound from not accurately knowing her
   instructions. In the meantime, look for the town's largest yard sale in
   the next month or two! ;)

Sunroom Makeover

   The sunroom in my mom's "new" house was the room we'd planned on
   painting first. Ironically, it's the room we ended up doing last. After
   move in day, we realized just how much work actually needed done and it
   was a bit overwhelming. We decided to start with her bedroom so that at
   least she'd have a real place to sleep.
   We then moved in the most logical order we could think of, with the
   living room, guest bedroom, and office. Thankfully, the kitchen was
   freshly painted and the bathrooms just needed the walls washed for
   now.
   Then there was the sunroom. Without this room, my mom wouldn't have
   bought the house. It adds a lot of square footage to the house, as well
   as a place for a dining room table (there is no other place for one in
   the home), and beyond that peach door is her large, walk-in pantry.
   [august2015%2B319.jpg]
    Needless to say, this room (much like the rest of the house) needed a
   lot of help. I finally remembered to take a "before" photo, which I
   wish I'd have remembered to do for the rest of the house. In the photos
   above and below, you'll see that this room was half peach/half dark
   wood paneling.
    I'll be honest, by the time we got to this room we were so over
   painting.
   Like, done painting.
   We did the next logical thing: hire a painter.
   The large white wall had to be completely re textured because of the
   poor original drywall job.
   [august2015%2B320.jpg]
    I love a good comparison photo...
   [august2015%2B339.jpg]
    We picked a snowy white for the walls because I just knew this room
   should be light, bright, and airy. The metal ceiling got a pale blue
   for contrast. It is not terribly noticeable, which is what we were
   going for. We were aiming for a breezy, beachy sunroom without having
   to actually buy a bunch of decor that says "beach" and making it
   obvious.
   [august2015%2B336.jpg]
    The daybed is perfect for this space! It's the Indonesian daybed from
   World Market and it's fabulous. My mom already had the large Euro
   pillows, and we bought the covers for them at Ikea. The quilt covering
   the mattress is also from World Market.
   [august2015%2B369.jpg]
    Since this room is also her dining room and an extension of her
   kitchen, the microwave had to go in here. We searched high and low and
   everywhere in between for something to put it on. I'm happy with what
   we finally found. It looks clean and sleek in this little corner by the
   pantry door. The light fixture was hideous, so we chose a new one at
   Lowe's and it's PERFECT!
   Michael's had these crates on clearance, and it was the perfect touch.
   [august2015%2B372.jpg]
    You can see the light fixture that was over the table in the before
   picture. The lights in this room were both plug in lights, so we had
   yet another challenge to meet. This distressed gray light from World
   Market was perfect, AND on sale. We are using some of her existing
   furniture that she brought with her. The pie safe and table came from
   her old home. Behind that door is her huge walk in pantry.
   [august2015%2B375.jpg]
    I bought these wicker chairs on a Facebook buying/selling group and
   spray painted them gray. We found the ivory cushions on clearance at
   World Market, and the pillows on clearance at Lowe's. The ottoman I
   snagged at an estate sale, and the side table is actually a stool from
   Ikea.
   [august2015%2B381.jpg]
    I bought my mom this large, gray distressed wood tray from
   decorsteals.com and it's perfect above the daybed. That blue bead board
   table was from an antique store.
   [august2015%2B383.jpg]
    The ocean photo is actually a picture my mom and dad took together in
   Morro Bay on one of their trips to visit me, so she wanted to be sure
   to use it. It's perfect in this room.
   [august2015%2B385.jpg]
   [august2015%2B386.jpg]
   [august2015%2B388.jpg]
   [august2015%2B389.jpg]
    This GREAT cart came from Ikea! One thing I knew we'd need to be heavy
   on in this room is greenery. I could picture this room from the very
   first time we looked at the house with the real estate agent. The
   bottom level of the cart holds my mom's shell collection.
   [august2015%2B391.jpg]
    We bought this wood plaque at a thrift store and I painted it blue,
   and then sanded it a bit to distress it. It is mounted above the window
   air conditioner to bring a little color to that white corner. This room
   was an add on, so it isn't a part of the central AC with the rest of
   the house.
   [august2015%2B393.jpg]
    The other light is also from World Market, and it is also a plug in
   light. In this spot, the old owners had a terribly ugly track lighting.
   Trust me, it was bad. We'd already removed it prior to taking the
   "before" photos.
   [august2015%2B394.jpg]
   I seriously want to go to my mom's every morning to drink my coffee.
   She told me that she tried to take a nap in here today, but couldn't
   because she didn't want to close her eyes. It was too pretty. Mission
   accomplished.
   Also, dear World Market, you're welcome.

Free Food

   Several weeks ago, I started a private Facebook group called Baeza
   Family Free Farmacy. I asked my Facebook friends to let me know if
   they'd like to be added to the group. Right now there are 40
   members.The sole purpose of the group is to give away free, fresh food
   from my garden. I happen to think that's pretty cool.
   Think of it as a free community library, food version.
   But not.
   You don't have to leave something, to take something.
   No fee or expectation.
   Only a "take what you will use" rule.
   Waste not, want not mentality.
   [Honey%2B045.jpg]
   I've always given away extra produce from the garden, and eggs from the
   hens. Let's face it, when you start keeping hens, you end up wanting
   more. You learn about different breeds, and add to your flock. Soon,
   you end up with tons of pets that just so happen to produce eggs.
   A few times, when starting out, I let friends pay a couple of bucks for
   eggs. After all, I do have to pay to feed them. I did have to pay for
   the garden start-up, the cartons, etc.
   But it just didn't feel right.
   I wanted to do something good and something that just plain made sense.
   [blueeggs%2B008.jpg]
   Common sense was telling me, "if you KNOW that you aren't going to use
   it before it goes bad, WHY are you stockpiling it in your fridge for it
   to waste away?"
   "WHY do you have so many eggs that you've resorted to giant bowls of
   eggs in the fridge?"
   Once you find yourself doing the water check for egg freshness, you
   know you have too many eggs.
   You know the trick, right? Fill up a bowl with water, and gently drop
   in your egg, if it floats, it's bad; stays at the bottom, it's fresh;
   has one end on the bottom and one end floating up, use it soon.
   Common sense said, give it away.
   There is no reinvention of the wheel here, no grandiose ideas, only a
   small effort to not waste life-giving fresh food.
   [Late%2BJuly%2B012.jpg]
    Yes, I still have plenty for us to eat.
   And the chickens too.
   The chickens keep me from being swallowed alive by cherry tomatoes that
   I didn't even plant.
   I don't give away what I can reasonably use or have time to preserve.
   Seriously though, sometimes you just can't bear to can another batch of
   pickles. Sometimes the mere sight of a canning jar leaves you wincing
   in exhaustion.
   The "rules" are simple: Only claim what you will actually eat, save
   your cartons and return them to me the next time you pick something up.
   It means that I'm not losing money constantly by ordering new cartons
   (or killing more trees).
   [Late%2BJuly%2B020.jpg]
   Now, when I know that I have extra, I post a quick photo in the group
   and the first person to claim it, picks it up that day. If they know
   they can't pick it up that day, they don't claim it.
   Simple.
   Useful.
   Mindful.
   Maybe you'll think about starting a free food group in your community
   as well!

Down Time Thoughts

   I've had so much time to just sit and think this past week. Well,
   actually lay on my side with a fan blowing on my burning skin because I
   can't sit- and think would be more accurate. A few things I've learned
   from being forced into down time.
   1. First of all, giving someone high doses of steroids and them not
   being able to get up and walk around is a special kind of torture.
   Giving me lots of energy and then no ability to move is not fun. It
   makes me lay here and think of all of the things that I should be,
   could be doing with this forced boost in my system.
   2. I must have time outside. Always. This is probably one of the more
   difficult things for me personally. I love working in my garden. The
   early mornings picking vegetables, afternoons pruning roses, collecting
   eggs from our crazy flock. I never fully realized how these routines
   are lifelines for me. My hands must be in the dirt. My heart needs
   sunshine.
   3. When you don't go outside for a week, you don't discover until it's
   too late, that your water timer batteries have died. Crossing my
   fingers for my dead baby tree. Sad face.
   4. You have never had the burning desire to vacuum your house. Until
   the thought of standing that long and possibly working up a sweat on
   your allergic reaction site prevents you from vacuuming. Suddenly you
   see your floors as gross. Disgusting. You see every dust bunny, every
   stray feather that your down couch has thrown out. And you can do
   nothing about it.
   5. Dinners sitting at the table are infinitely more enjoyable than
   eating while standing with your bum in front of a fan. Hear me:
   infinitely. Still waiting on the return of the sitting, mind you.
   6. The smallest things give you the largest amount of joy. Taking your
   pain pill (and sitting on the side of your hip in the car) and having
   your husband drive you to the Farmers' Market before it gets too hot?
   The first fresh figs of summer, watermelon straight from the farm,
   grain free brownies (because, steroids), juicy peaches, and a pit stop
   on the way home for king crab and your favorite citrus heat tri-tip?
   Yes. All of the above. When life hands you lemons, make king crab.
   Making the most fabulous dinner you can imagine is the trade off for
   having spent zero money this week. When you can't leave the house, the
   money stays in the bank. Well, mostly...
   7. Which brings me to my next point: online shopping from bed. It had
   to be done. I blame it on my dad, he always took me shopping when there
   were major bummers he couldn't fix. Oh, you're overdue pregnant and
   STILL haven't dilated, let's dry those tears and go to Target. Yes,
   before you go telling me that shopping doesn't fix anything, I know
   that. It sure does raise the spirits though. Thanks, dad.
   8. You never want to hear your daughter scream "SNAKE IN THE HOUSE"
   ever, but especially when you are in a state of hardly being able to
   walk, and benadryl is threatening your level of consciousness. Just,
   no.
   9. Note to self when you get better: the hubs, beloved as he may be,
   might need a crash course in laundry when you're well enough to teach
   him. Judging by the fact that you asked him to dry his work clothes you
   managed to put in the washer earlier, and woke up in the morning to his
   wet clothes laid out all over the living room floor. Wet. We don't have
   heated floors mind you, and even if we did, this would not be an
   approved method for clothes drying. Especially because we have a
   dryer.
   10. Friends are the BEST. They will bring you chocolate, donuts, and
   Downton Abbey DVDs. These are lifelines.
   11. When you have your mother in law drive you to the grocery store,
   and you're going commando and wearing the loosest, softest romper you
   have, it's okay to buy yourself flowers. Buy the flowers, and go back
   to bed and fan your bum.
