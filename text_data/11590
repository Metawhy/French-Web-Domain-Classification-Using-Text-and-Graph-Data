   visitors to our website, aggregate information on what pages visitors
   access, and information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey
   information, e-mail and other addresses and other personal
   information).

   The information we collect is used to improve the content of our
   website, to notify visitors about updates to our website, and alert
   visitors about issues and opportunities. The information is not shared

   ecommerce integrators) for the express purpose of conducting financial
   transactions. It is important to note that credit card numbers are used
   only at the time of the transaction and are not stored following the
   conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that
   occurs on a regular basis. For transactions that recur, credit card
   information is stored in an encrypted format.

   written request. If you would like to have your donation refunded,
