   Sweet afternoon

   Must try those delicious cakes . We bought several so we can try each
   one. Cappuccino and regular coffee accompanied with all those cakes
   made this Sunday afternoon a sweet deal. Service was great and
   spontaneous and $11/per slice not too expensive

   Scrumptious Ice Cream choices but be patient as service is glacial

   We were staying nearby and made Morgensterns our nightly ritual. Always
   a line because they only had 2 people working and the Caviar pickups

   Better off at CVS

   Just had my Ice cream. Very underwhelming and not worth the calories I
   indulged. Only thing more underwhelming than the ice cream was the
   inefficient in-process wait. Wait, Sample, pay, wait? Better off buying
   a pint at CVS or Walgreens. My girlfriend likes it.

   Midtown
   This is the iconic New York that so many visitors
   imagine before they visit‚Äîspectacular skyscrapers like
   the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building,
   iconic public buildings like Grand Central Terminal
   and the New York Public Library, and the non-stop
   hustle and bustle of the city streets. Fifth Avenue is
   a shopper's heaven where you can find every kind of
   store imaginable, with fashion brands ranging from the
   ...More
   affordable to the ultra-fancy. Visit the Rockefeller
   Center to experience towering Art Deco grandeur, and
   foodies will love the busy restaurants that stay open
   late in Koreatown. After dark, Midtown calms down a
   bit, but at any time of day or night it still feels
   100% New York.
