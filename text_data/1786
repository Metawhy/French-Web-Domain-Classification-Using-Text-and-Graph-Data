DRUG-RESISTANT CHILDHOOD EPILEPSIES

   When epilepsy is not controlled by medical treatment, surgery should be
   considered as soon as possible, depending on the type of epilepsy and
   the possibility of determining its origin.

   Physical examination, video EEG tests, imaging and neuropsychological
   tests may sometimes lead directly to surgery in the simplest cases.

   Sometimes it is necessary to go further and conduct what are known as
   "invasive" tests, with the insertion of intracerebral electrodes to
   accurately determine the exact source of the epilepsy.

   These intracranial investigations may be performed using one of 2
   techniques: either the insertion of subdural plates and deep electrodes
   by craniotomy or stereo-EEG (SEEG) with deep electrodes inserted using
   the stereotactic robot. In both cases, the child's seizures will be
   recorded by the intracranial electrodes for a week. Following this
   intracranial video-EEG monitoring, a decision can be reached concerning
   which surgery should be performed. This preoperative assessment may
   sometimes include intracranial brain stimulation (motor or language
   mapping).

   The development of endoscopic methods has made it possible to treat
   epilepsies due to hypothalamic hamartomas for which there was
   previously no treatment solution.

TUMOURS

   Whether a tumour is in a cerebral hemisphere, the posterior fossa or
   the spinal cord, in addition to emergency procedures if required
   (treatment of hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, spinal cord
   compression), the long-term treatment is always based on medical and
   surgical collaboration with specialised oncologists, in partnership
   with the Institut Curie.

CERVICO-OCCIPITAL JUNCTION MALFORMATIONS

   Decompression procedures are performed with or without spinal
   stabilisation. When it is required, stabilisation is performed by the
   orthopaedic team at Robert Debré Hospital, where a multidisciplinary
   consultation system (neurosurgery, orthopaedics, GI and urological
   surgery) has been in place for over 10 years.

CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS

   Craniosynostosis is treated by remodelling or decompression procedures
   in the absence of complex craniofacial stenosis (Crouzon syndrome,
   Appert syndrome).

HYDROCEPHALUS

   Treatment may be a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or a
   ventriculocisternostomy, depending on the nature of the condition.

   Relieving pain has always been a priority in medicine. A better
   understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain, clinical
   identification of chronic pain as a condition in its own right to be
   differentiated from acute, symptomatic pain, and the economic cost of
   this condition have led to the development of Pain Treatment Units. The
   International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) set up an
   internal working group tasked with defining such structures; its
   conclusions, set out in a report, were presented at the 6th World
   Congress on Pain in Adelaide in April 1990.

   The Centre d'Evaluation et de Traitement de la Douleur (CETD - Centre
   for Pain Assessment and Treatment) at the Fondation Ophtalmologique
   Adolphe de Rothschild Hospital, a structure identified by the Ministry
   in 1998, designed on a multidisciplinary basis, offers consultations
   and hospital admissions (dedicated 10-bed unit). Its missions are to
     * offer global care for patients suffering from incapacitating,
       recalcitrant, severe pain. Eliminate pain wherever possible and
       reduce it to tolerable levels in other cases, using all known
       pharmacological and neurosurgical methods, combined with
       appropriate psychosocial care. This global approach is designed to
       eliminate or reduce pain-related disability and improve the quality
       of life of patients suffering pain.
     * provide training for nursing personnel, contribute to teaching in a
       university context (capacité: professional training certificate,
       DIU: specialised postgraduate certificate) and for nursing and
       physiotherapy schools.
     * Supervise trainees in the department and the consultation service
       (doctors seeking professional certification, student nurses, nurses
       receiving training, physiotherapy trainees, psychology students,
       etc.).
     * Set up drug protocols (clinical research) using effective and
       validated assessment tools (questionnaires, pain scales).
     * Participate in the various activities of academic societies on a
       national and international level to promote the development and
       dissemination of the discipline.

       increase font size

   Treatment plans vary depending on the case and the assigned ENT
   care: consultation, day hospital, outpatient surgical unit,
   conventional hospitalisation service, or the surgical block.

Consultations

   This department consists of a patient reception area, the secretarial
   service, 8 ENT consultation rooms, 1 nursing care room and the
   functional explorations area.

   The ENT consultations sector is particularly well equipped: standard
   ENT examination equipment in every consultation room, several
   microscopes to examine ears, numerous fibroscopes and endoscopes to
   examine noses and sinuses, the throat and the vocal cords, as well as
   specific equipment for investigating voice and speech disorders.

   The functional explorations area has 4 audiology rooms for routine
   hearing tests. Electrophysiological investigations can also be
   performed in certain situations (auditory evoked potentials,
   otoacoustic emissions, etc.). Two rooms are specifically equipped to
   investigate vertigo and balance problems. Sophisticated equipment is
   available for investigating voice disorders, enabling computer analysis
   of the voice, fibroscopy, endoscopy and stroboscopy of the larynx, as
   well as photo or video recording of the vocal cords.

   Consultations are arranged on an appointment basis, from Monday to
   Friday, 8.30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.

The Day Hospital

   Open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., several tests can be
   conducted on the same day and certain conditions not requiring full
   hospitalisation can be treated (e.g. treatment of sudden hearing loss,
   treatment of cervicofacial dystonia by injection of botulinum toxin).

Hospitalisation

   18 bed capacity (7 rooms with 2 beds, 4 rooms with 1 bed, including one
   specially equipped for investigating snoring and sleep disorders).
   This department admits patients for whom a stay of 2 or more days is
   necessary.
   It is also here that patients requiring an outpatient surgical
   procedure (i.e. conducted during the day, with no need for an overnight
   stay in the hospital) are received and monitored.

Outpatient Surgery and Procedures

   Patients requiring an outpatient surgical procedure - i.e. conducted
   during the day, with no need for an overnight stay in the hospital -
   are received and monitored.

   The surgeon and anesthesiologist's decision to perform a procedure on
   an outpatient basis meets very strict criteria: type of surgery,
   comorbidities, distance from home, presence of a third party on return
   home, etc.

The Operating Room

   Within the surgical block (comprising several operating theatres for
   the various surgical specialities, a recovery and post-surgical
   monitoring room), one or two rooms are specifically dedicated to ENT
   and cervicofacial surgery.

   ENT surgical equipment is particularly high-performance and
   cutting-edge:
     * Several surgical microscopes
     * Video endoscopy equipment for nasal and sinus surgery, ear surgery
       and base of skull surgery.
     * Laser CO[2], laser thulium
     * System for intraoperative facial nerve detection and monitoring
     * Computer-assisted surgical equipment for detection of dangerous or
       important anatomical structures during surgery, particularly for
       certain sinus procedures

DRUG-RESISTANT CHILDHOOD EPILEPSIES

   When epilepsy is not controlled by medical treatment, surgery should be
   considered as soon as possible, depending on the type of epilepsy and
   the possibility of determining its origin.

   Physical examination, video EEG tests, imaging and neuropsychological
   tests may sometimes lead directly to surgery in the simplest cases.

   Sometimes it is necessary to go further and conduct what are known as
   "invasive" tests, with the insertion of intracerebral electrodes to
   accurately determine the exact source of the epilepsy.

   These intracranial investigations may be performed using one of 2
   techniques: either the insertion of subdural plates and deep electrodes
   by craniotomy or stereo-EEG (SEEG) with deep electrodes inserted using
   the stereotactic robot. In both cases, the child's seizures will be
   recorded by the intracranial electrodes for a week. Following this
   intracranial video-EEG monitoring, a decision can be reached concerning
   which surgery should be performed. This preoperative assessment may
   sometimes include intracranial brain stimulation (motor or language
   mapping).

   The development of endoscopic methods has made it possible to treat
   epilepsies due to hypothalamic hamartomas for which there was
   previously no treatment solution.

TUMOURS

   Whether a tumour is in a cerebral hemisphere, the posterior fossa or
   the spinal cord, in addition to emergency procedures if required
   (treatment of hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, spinal cord
   compression), the long-term treatment is always based on medical and
   surgical collaboration with specialised oncologists, in partnership
   with the Institut Curie.

CERVICO-OCCIPITAL JUNCTION MALFORMATIONS

   Decompression procedures are performed with or without spinal
   stabilisation. When it is required, stabilisation is performed by the
   orthopaedic team at Robert Debré Hospital, where a multidisciplinary
   consultation system (neurosurgery, orthopaedics, GI and urological
   surgery) has been in place for over 10 years.

CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS

   Craniosynostosis is treated by remodelling or decompression procedures
   in the absence of complex craniofacial stenosis (Crouzon syndrome,
   Appert syndrome).

HYDROCEPHALUS

   Treatment may be a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or a
   ventriculocisternostomy, depending on the nature of the condition.

   Relieving pain has always been a priority in medicine. A better
   understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain, clinical
   identification of chronic pain as a condition in its own right to be
   differentiated from acute, symptomatic pain, and the economic cost of
   this condition have led to the development of Pain Treatment Units. The
   International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) set up an
   internal working group tasked with defining such structures; its
   conclusions, set out in a report, were presented at the 6th World
   Congress on Pain in Adelaide in April 1990.

   The Centre d'Evaluation et de Traitement de la Douleur (CETD - Centre
   for Pain Assessment and Treatment) at the Fondation Ophtalmologique
   Adolphe de Rothschild Hospital, a structure identified by the Ministry
   in 1998, designed on a multidisciplinary basis, offers consultations
   and hospital admissions (dedicated 10-bed unit). Its missions are to
     * offer global care for patients suffering from incapacitating,
       recalcitrant, severe pain. Eliminate pain wherever possible and
       reduce it to tolerable levels in other cases, using all known
       pharmacological and neurosurgical methods, combined with
       appropriate psychosocial care. This global approach is designed to
       eliminate or reduce pain-related disability and improve the quality
       of life of patients suffering pain.
     * provide training for nursing personnel, contribute to teaching in a
       university context (capacité: professional training certificate,
       DIU: specialised postgraduate certificate) and for nursing and
       physiotherapy schools.
     * Supervise trainees in the department and the consultation service
       (doctors seeking professional certification, student nurses, nurses
       receiving training, physiotherapy trainees, psychology students,
       etc.).
     * Set up drug protocols (clinical research) using effective and
       validated assessment tools (questionnaires, pain scales).
     * Participate in the various activities of academic societies on a
       national and international level to promote the development and
       dissemination of the discipline.

   Treatment plans vary depending on the case and the assigned ENT
   care: consultation, day hospital, outpatient surgical unit,
   conventional hospitalisation service, or the surgical block.

Consultations

   This department consists of a patient reception area, the secretarial
   service, 8 ENT consultation rooms, 1 nursing care room and the
   functional explorations area.

   The ENT consultations sector is particularly well equipped: standard
   ENT examination equipment in every consultation room, several
   microscopes to examine ears, numerous fibroscopes and endoscopes to
   examine noses and sinuses, the throat and the vocal cords, as well as
   specific equipment for investigating voice and speech disorders.

   The functional explorations area has 4 audiology rooms for routine
   hearing tests. Electrophysiological investigations can also be
   performed in certain situations (auditory evoked potentials,
   otoacoustic emissions, etc.). Two rooms are specifically equipped to
   investigate vertigo and balance problems. Sophisticated equipment is
   available for investigating voice disorders, enabling computer analysis
   of the voice, fibroscopy, endoscopy and stroboscopy of the larynx, as
   well as photo or video recording of the vocal cords.

   Consultations are arranged on an appointment basis, from Monday to
   Friday, 8.30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.

The Day Hospital

   Open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., several tests can be
   conducted on the same day and certain conditions not requiring full
   hospitalisation can be treated (e.g. treatment of sudden hearing loss,
   treatment of cervicofacial dystonia by injection of botulinum toxin).

Hospitalisation

   18 bed capacity (7 rooms with 2 beds, 4 rooms with 1 bed, including one
   specially equipped for investigating snoring and sleep disorders).
   This department admits patients for whom a stay of 2 or more days is
   necessary.
   It is also here that patients requiring an outpatient surgical
   procedure (i.e. conducted during the day, with no need for an overnight
   stay in the hospital) are received and monitored.

Outpatient Surgery and Procedures

   Patients requiring an outpatient surgical procedure - i.e. conducted
   during the day, with no need for an overnight stay in the hospital -
   are received and monitored.

   The surgeon and anesthesiologist's decision to perform a procedure on
   an outpatient basis meets very strict criteria: type of surgery,
   comorbidities, distance from home, presence of a third party on return
   home, etc.

The Operating Room

   Within the surgical block (comprising several operating theatres for
   the various surgical specialities, a recovery and post-surgical
   monitoring room), one or two rooms are specifically dedicated to ENT
   and cervicofacial surgery.

   ENT surgical equipment is particularly high-performance and
   cutting-edge:
     * Several surgical microscopes
     * Video endoscopy equipment for nasal and sinus surgery, ear surgery
       and base of skull surgery.
     * Laser CO[2], laser thulium
     * System for intraoperative facial nerve detection and monitoring
     * Computer-assisted surgical equipment for detection of dangerous or
       important anatomical structures during surgery, particularly for
       certain sinus procedures

   This anaesthesia consultation, which should ideally take place 3 weeks
   before your surgery, is compulsory.

   During this anaesthesia consultation, the anaesthesiologist will assess
   your medical condition and discuss with you the most appropriate
   anaesthesia method for the surgical or radiological procedure you are
   to undergo. Our pain management options will also be explained to you.

   The anaesthesiologist will outline the risks related to anaesthesia to
   you and ask you to give your consent to this treatment by signing an
   "anaesthesia consent form".

   In the event of a surgical or neuroradiological procedure involving a
   bleeding risk, the anaesthesiologist will provide you with specific
   information about blood transfusions. Once again, you will be asked to
   indicate your consent to a transfusion if required by signing a
   "transfusion procedure consent form".

   Please note: For surgery involving a bleeding risk, your refusal to
   sign the "transfusion procedure consent form" for whatever religious or
   philosophical reason, will automatically lead to the surgery being
   cancelled.

   Vertebral conditions (in particular lumbar sciatica due to a herniated
   disc or other causes)
   Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatoid diseases, primarily including
   Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis.

   General systemic diseases, which are diseases affecting several organs
   simultaneously or consecutively and which may be detected, in
   particular, as a result of eye, brain or nerve involvement. The
   majority of these are uncommon but potentially very serious diseases,
   such as:  acute disseminated lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis,
   Sarcoidosis, Systemic vasculitis (Wegener's disease, Churg-Strauss
   syndrome, etc.), Chronic atrophic polychondritis, Polymyositis and
   dermatomyositis, etc.

Cardiology Unit

   Aetiological assessment of ischaemic strokes (patients treated in the
   neurovascular unit, intensive care and interventional neuroradiology
   department) and for preoperative assessment prior to non-cardiac
   surgery.

   Management of hospitalised cardiac patients or patients presenting a
   cardiac problem during their hospital stay.

Endocrinology

   Management of endocrinological problems (diabetes, hormonal
   disturbances) that may emerge during a hospital stay. In particular,
   the department monitors the hormone levels of Neurosurgery Department
   patients undergoing surgical procedures on the pituitary gland, which
   secretes hormones essential to numerous, and sometimes vital, metabolic
   functions. Thyroid diseases detected as a result of eye diseases
   (Graves' disease, for example) may also be concerned. Follow-up
   consultations are provided for Thyroid and Pituitary conditions.

Ophtalmology Emergencies

The ophthalmology emergencies department

   Emergencies at the A. de Rothschild Foundation are open 24 hours a day
   for people with a recent visual problem, regardless of age, children
   and adults, excluding loss or breakage of spectacle lenses.

   The reception is done by the emergency nurse who specifies the reason
   for consultation: decreased visual acuity, double vision, pain, redness
   or swelling of the eye, abrupt drooping eyelid or other problem after
   trauma or accidental projection in the eye. With this interrogation,
   the establishment of an order of passage in consultation is possible,
   according to the degree of gravity.

   Children are given priority, whenever possible.

   Our emergencies benefit from the constant presence of an
   ophthalmologist. In case of immediate surgical emergency, the
   intervention is carried out on site, after medical advice, day and
   night, in children as in adults.

   Specific problems can be dealt with by practitioners specializing in
   the discipline concerned: it is thus an ophthalmologist specializing in
   the retina who takes care of and operates the detachments of the
   retina.

   The ophtalmology emergencies department works in partnership with the
   other non-ophthalmological departments of the A. de Rothschild
   Foundation: neurology, adult and children neurosurgery, ENT, internal
   medicine and the medical imaging department, which includes a scanner
   and two MRI.
