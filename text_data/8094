Sia cooper

   I went to nursing school in 2010 and this is where my weight began
   climbing. By the time of my graduation, I was overweight, constantly
   sick, and tired of feeling heavy. I was a full-time college student
   working part time and I was making barely any money to afford anything
   more than fast food. I had no clue where to start so I decided to
   educate myself and make a lifestyle change in which I dropped 45lbs in
   just 9 months, from clean eating alone.

   I started my blog as a way to help keep me accountable, and share with
   others what has worked and what hasn’t. I also used my blog to help
   keep me accountable throughout my first pregnancy in which I worked out
   until labor began and gained 30lbs throughout.

   Through this website, I hope to motivate and inspire as many people as
   I can to transform their lives for the better.

   Your trainer and friend,
