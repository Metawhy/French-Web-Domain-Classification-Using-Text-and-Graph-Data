$4.8M Department of Ed Grant to Fund Innovative Teacher Prep Program at CSUMB

   SEASIDE, Ca., October 8, 2019 – California State University Monterey
   Bay (CSUMB) has been selected to receive funding under the U.S.
   Department of Education’s Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program in
   the amount of $4,849,320; $2.2M of which will go directly to student
   scholarships.

   The award, expected to span over a total of five years, will also help
   fund a project entitled Preparing Observational Practitioners through
   Partnerships Yearlong (POPPY) and support CSUMB partnerships with eight
   school districts across Monterey County, further advancing the “grow
   your own” model of teacher preparation.

   Through this funding we will be able to provide support to our faculty
   for curricular reform and research that will not only improve our
   teacher preparation programs, but provide the supports needed to
   improve the educational outcomes of K-12 students throughout Monterey
   County."
   — Project POPPY principal investigator and CSUMB Department of
   Education and Leadership assistant professor Erin Ramirez.

   Project POPPY aims to increase achievement among K-12 students by
   preparing highly-qualified prospective teachers through rigorous
   curriculum reform, a yearlong clinical residency model and sustained
   intensive professional development opportunities in both STEM and
   literacy fields. Project POPPY has five goals centered around:
   Department of Education
     * Teacher recruitment from underrepresented populations and
       high-needs subject areas.
     * A residency model that includes a year-long clinical experience
       with a highly-qualified mentor teacher and tightly-aligned rigorous
       graduate level coursework.
     * Providing support to new teachers to aid in retention and
       professional learning.
     * Sustained evidence-based and classroom-focused professional
       development opportunities around STEM and literacy integration
       across the curriculum.
     * Improvement science to engage in continuous improvement throughout
       the duration of the project.

   “We greatly appreciate this funding from the U.S. Department of
   Education for a program designed to meet the diverse needs of CSUMB
   students and our partner districts,” said Project POPPY principal
   investigator and CSUMB Department of Education and Leadership assistant
   professor Erin Ramirez. “The scholarships will support CSUMB students
   that may not have otherwise been able to obtain a master's degree,
   while committing to teach in our high-needs partner districts. Through
   this funding we will be able to provide support to our faculty for
   curricular reform and research that will not only improve our teacher
   preparation programs, but provide the supports needed to improve the
   educational outcomes of K-12 students throughout Monterey County.”

   Expected outcomes of Project POPPY include recruiting teachers from
   underrepresented populations and high-needs content areas; increasing
   the number of highly-qualified teachers entering the field so that
   partner districts can hire and retain effective new teachers;
   supporting new teacher retention and effectiveness; expanding teacher
   knowledge around STEM practices and integrating literacy across the
   content areas to improve student achievement and reduce the number of
   Long Term English Learners.

   Programs such as Project POPPY directly support the CSU Graduation
   Initiative 2025, which is a university-wide initiative to ensure that
   all students have the opportunity to be successful and graduate
   according to their personal goals, positively impacting their future
   and producing additional graduates to power California and the nation.

   The TQP program is authorized under Title II of the Higher Education
   Act with the purpose of improving student achievement, elevating the
   quality of the teacher workforce by enhancing preparation of
   prospective teachers and professional development of new teachers, and
   recruiting highly qualified individuals into the teacher workforce.

CSUMB Celebrates 25 Years of Progress, Success

   By CSUMB President Eduardo M. Ochoa

   In the early 1990s, Monterey County faced a potential economic
   calamity. The impending closure of Fort Ord put tens of thousands of
   private-sector jobs at risk, threatening to slash tax revenues and the
   budgets of schools and government agencies.

   In response, community leaders came together to support a visionary
   plan, focused on the creation of a new Cal State University campus on
   the abandoned military base.

   Long-time residents may find it hard to believe, but this academic year
   Cal State Monterey Bay is celebrating its 25th anniversary. And I
   believe it is fulfilling the hopes of those who saw a public university
   as an invaluable asset in the transition and continued prosperity of
   the Central Coast economy.
   CSUMB President Eduardo M. Ochoa

   Evidence of the growing academic reputation of CSUMB came in the latest
   U.S. News & World Report college rankings. In the West region, which is
   made up of 14 states ranging from Texas to Alaska and Hawaii, CSUMB was
   rated #8 among public regional universities and #26 among all
   regionals, public and private.

   U.S. News also rated CSUMB as one of the top three regional
   universities in the West in promoting social mobility.

   When Money Magazine ranked our nation’s most transformational colleges
   – those schools that help students achieve more that would be expected
   based on their academic and economic backgrounds -- CSUMB was placed
   16th nationwide, outpacing 728 other universities and colleges.

   At a time of ever-widening gaps between the rich and poor, the role of
   education in addressing those issues is particularly urgent.

   A Public Policy Institute of California study, released earlier this
   year, found that economic polarization poses a threat to our state’s
   future prosperity.

   “Ensuring access to education that prepares the state’s increasingly
   diverse workers for in-demand jobs is a key challenge both for future
   economic growth and for the economic well-being of California’s
   families,” the report states.

   “Because the state economy demands a highly skilled workforce,
   education plays a crucial role in helping California remain
   economically competitive. Promoting education is also an important
   strategy for addressing inequality and improving economic mobility.”

   More than half of CSUMB students are the first generation of their
   families to attend college; about a third are classified as low-income.

   That’s why rankings that show CSUMB producing positive results with
   students from all backgrounds are so gratifying.

   Since its founding, Cal State Monterey Bay has focused on providing
   educational opportunities for low-income and minority students who were
   not being adequately served by existing four-year institutions. Our
   recent rankings success reflects the progress we have made in improving
   retention and graduation rates for all students, while keeping our
   tuition and fees well below national averages.

   In recent years, we also have built stronger ties to our area’s
   excellent community colleges – including Hartnell, Monterey Peninsula
   and Cabrillo colleges – to provide affordable and accessible pathways
   for all students seeking four-year degrees.

   We recognize that our existence is the result of a strongly committed
   community, which saw the creation of a new university not just as a
   stopgap to meet a short-term crisis, but as a long-term strategy. The
   goal was and is to provide opportunities for a broad cross-section of
   our residents.

   Back in 1992, the Fort Ord Community Task Force called the military
   base’s closure a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity… to reclaim this land
   and use it to enhance the quality of life in the region.”

   We think we are doing pretty well in fulfilling that vision. We invite
   you all to see for yourselves on Oct. 12 at “Discover CSUMB: Open
   Campus,” the next big event of our 25th anniversary celebration.

   The day-long (10 a.m. to 10 p.m.) celebration is one way of saying
   “Welcome” and “Thank you” to the community that was instrumental in our
   founding 25 years ago.
