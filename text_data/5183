Bananas: The Natural Anxiety Reducer

   Posted on June 10, 2019 by Lady Fair

   Like you, I was somewhat skeptical when someone told me bananas could
   help reduce anxiety. After reading this article, I was convinced!

   For those of you who still have recitals, concerts, or auditions,
   consider eating some bananas before you go. I also encourage my
   students to do the same before a test or recital. Even if only one
   banana isn’t as affective as two, students have reported feeling much
   less nervous before a performance.

   Also worth noting that bananas can help reduce swelling in your
   extremities.

   Enjoy the article! (and the bananas)

My TpT Resources

   Posted on August 31, 2018 by Lady Fair

   If you haven’t visited the Teachers Pay Teachers website, you’re
   missing out. There you will find TONS of printable resources, lesson
   plans, activities, and so much more that you can use in your classroom,
   or even with your own children or private students.

   In my store I have attempted to create useful items that teachers
   specifically request, and I sell things that I have personally used in
   my classes. I thought, I spent all this time creating these things, why
   not make a little money AND help other teachers out?

   Some of my items include:
     * A basic Marzano “scale” sheet.
     * Clef mnemonic charts
     * Crosswords/Wordsearches
     * Lesson plans
     * PowerPoints to accompany Silver Burdett lessons.
     * Games like Jeopardy, Bingo! or “Find Someone Who”.
     * Quizzes, worksheets, and other assessment tools.
     * Drama resources.
     * Video guides.
     * Rhythm activities
     * Templates for ensemble handbooks, concert/recital programs, and
       more!

The Vocal Mechanism and MRI

   Posted on August 31, 2018 by Lady Fair

   Long time no see.

   That’s because I’ve been growing my student base as well as working on
   a novel (you can learn more about that on my other blog).I am going to
   attempt to be more regular and share more often here for my loyal fans
   and desperate music teachers (lol).

   I stumbled across this video recently, and it is amazing! One of the
   most challenging aspects of teaching voice is the fact that every voice
   is different, and you can’t see it! In a clarinet lesson I can tell
   almost instantly whether a squeak is due to finger placement, reed,
   embouchure, or a problem with the instrument itself. And then I can
   visually confirm my suspicions. If only it were that easy with voice!

   In this video, Tyley Ross performs a snippet of a vocal solo in four
   different styles: a light (what I call natural) tone, operatic,
   Broadway, and rock. He shows the interior of his vocal mechanism, using
   an MRI, and then compares the shape with the difference in the sound.
   It’s really cool.

   Check out the video here!

“NoteSpeed” game for Solfege!

   Posted on July 11, 2018 by Lady Fair

   I recently bought the amazing game called NoteSpeed. My students like
   it, and I enjoy it too! But I thought it would be great if there were a
   solfege version (there isn’t) so I decided to make one for myself!

Mass Shootings: Please, don’t scare the children.

   Posted on February 22, 2018 by Lady Fair

   Note: This is not a political statement either for or against guns,
   just something worth noting if you teach children.

   Most of my students are either young and blissfully unaware of the
   shooting that ocurred last week, or they are slightly older and are
   discussing it with their friends. I had one student who was very
   concerned about the shooting the day after, but particularly by a
   statistic the kids at school were talking about: that there have been
   18 mass shootings this year (or some say 18 school shootings this
   year).

   While it is true that there have been 18 incidents of a gun being
   discharged on school campuses, they are not mass shootings or what we
   tend to refer to as a “school shooting”. This particular statistic
   includes things like:
     *   A man parking in the school’s parking lot and killing himself.
     * Accidental discharge of a gun at a military high school.
     * Accidental discharge of a police officer’s gun
     * A teenager committing suicide in the bathroom
     * A personal dispute being continued at a football game after school.
     * USA Today has an article listing all events.

   Yes, these things are horrible! I wish they didn’t happen! (Notice I’m
   not proclaiming a solution or attempting to explain why they happen).

   It is important that we, as teachers, are honest with our students and
   do not hype them up or cause fear. They look to us, one of the few
   adults in their lives they probably trust, for guidance and reaction.
   If we behave as though we are terrified, the kids will be even more so.
   They are already upset by what they hear on the news and from their
   friends, and I believe that we have a duty to reassure them that they
   are safe. The likelihood of a student being involved in a situation
   like the one in Parkland is very low. A student is more likely to be
   struck by lightning or hit by a car.

   Whatever your view politically, please, try not to scare the children.

Chord Identification Flash Cards

   Posted on February 21, 2018 by Lady Fair

   Flashcards I created for another piano teacher. They are meant to help
   students practice identifying their major and minor keys and chords.

   Includes: 33 major & minor chords, plus Cb7, C diminished, C augmented.
   14 cards for identifying what chord it is in the key of C (tonic,
   submediant, etc) and what inversion the chord is in.

   If printing at home, simply print page one, flip it and print page 2.
   Then repeat for pages 3 and 4.

Holiday Solfege Bingo!

   Posted on December 17, 2017 by Lady Fair

   In this 5×5 bingo game students are given a short phrase from a popular
   Christmas or Hannukah tune (both sacred and secular included) and the
   starting “do”, along with the key signature. Use this fun bingo game to
   test your students’ solfege skills by calling out the title of the
   song, or singing the tune. For a challenge, white out the starting “do”
   and require advanced students to work it out on their own. Also works
   well in teams or pairs. Calling card includes title so teacher doesn’t
   have to solfege on the go!

   CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE

   Yes, I am aware that it might be more expensive than you would
   typically prefer, but consider the following: it took me probably about
   16 hours to make it, it will save you significant time planning for the
   week before break, and can take up several hours of lesson or exam time
   that you would otherwise have to prepare for on your own. It is also an
   excellent review for sight-reading and solfege skills while being a fun
   activity!

   Features: 24 different melodies of varying difficulty, 13 unique
   student cards, teacher calling card with song titles, “do” indicated,
   key signature given. All melodies are in treble clef.

   Songs included:
     * 12 Days of Christmas
     * All I Want for Christmas is You
     * Angels We Have Heard on High
     * Away in a Manger
     * Chestnuts (The Christmas Song)
     * Deck the Halls
     * Dreidel
     * Frosty the Snowman
     * God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen
     * Greensleeves/What Child is This?
     * Oh, Hannukah
     * Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
     * Hatikvah
     * Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
     * I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus
     * Jingle Bells
     * Joy to the World
     * O Come, All Ye Faithful
     * O, Holy Night
     * O Little Town of Bethlehem
     * Ode to Joy
     * Oh, Christmas Tree
     * Santa Claus is Coming to Town
     * Silent Night
