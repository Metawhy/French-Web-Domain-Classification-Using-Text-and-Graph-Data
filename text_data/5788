Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee's New Language Packs on Steam

   What's Italian for "burp"?

   Posted on September 4, 2019 in News by Oddworld Staff

   The Steam version of Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee is getting a brand new
   multilingual addition this week. Thanks to a fan project and the
   cooperation of our partners at Square One Games, several new language
   packs are making their way from the Xbox version of Munch’s Oddysee,
   onto the Steam version.

   To celebrate, we made some cute graphics!
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *

   Those additional languages are: French, Italian, German and Spanish.
   The new content will download as an update to the game if you have it
   set to automatically do such things.

   You can check out Munch’s Oddysee on Steam here.

   Thanks to Jacopo Berti (SgabbitGabbiar) for starting this process and
   digging up the language packs.

   Oddworld: Soulstorm - Abe's hand

Abe, as you've never seen him before.

   Ravaged, desperate and hopelessly unprepared - with three hundred
   hungry mouths to lead across a brutal landscape of nasty surprises.

"frustrating,
disgusting,
challenging,
thought-provoking
and relentlessly
entertaining"

   Rolling Stone Magazine
   All time cult classic brands
   Oddworld: Soulstorm - Abe's chest

A dark, twisted trip into Abe's heart and soul.

   In Soulstorm's devilishly twisted story, we’re telling an incendiary
   tale of uprising and infiltration against the latest in soul-sucking
   consumer products.

"If Oddworld... can keep creating games that intermingle fart jokes with the
very real injustices that happen in industrial work, we're going to have
something incredible to look forward to."

   Zack Furness
   Destructoid
   Oddworld: Soulstorm - Abe's face

A diabolical new storm is brewing

   Introducing a brand new brew of highly volatile flavors packed into one
   relentlessly addictive experience.

Press Release

   Oddworld: Soulstorm

   San Francisco, March 14th 2016

   Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. are today proud to announce Oddworld:
   Soulstorm, now being co-developed by Oddworld’s own internal teams in
   California and the UK.

   A follow-up to the critically acclaimed* release of Oddworld: New ‘n’
   Tasty, Oddworld: Soulstorm picks up from Abe’s genesis and directly
   follows on from the overthrow of RuptureFarms and the liberation of his
   blighted workmates.

   Having defeated Molluck The Glukkon, his former boss and RuptureFarms’
   meanest inhabitant, Abe soon finds himself - along with 300 newly
   emancipated Mudokons - without food, water or a place to call home.
   Stranded alone in the desert, they find solace in a strange new brew -
   a delicious drink that has insidious ramifications for their newfound
   freedom.

   "There was a deeper, darker, and more sinister story that we never got
   to tell," explains series creator, Lorne Lanning. "Soulstorm gives us
   the opportunity to flesh out more meat on the bones of an original
   spine, but re-tell the fable from a very different angle."

   "Abe has a long way to go and plenty more adversity ahead. Soulstorm is
   going to be a much heavier trip for him."

   Oddworld: Soulstorm will continue to chew up the themes of
   environmentalism, capitalism, consumerism and addiction that critics
   and fans found so engaging in the "AAA Indie" release of Oddworld’s
   last pensive platformer, New ’n’ Tasty.

   "We can’t wait to show you what we’ve got planned for Soulstorm" says
   executive producer Bennie Terry.

   "We think Oddworld fans are really going to dig what we’re brewing, and
   we’ve got some great surprises in store this time around we don’t think
   anybody’s going to predict," he added. "I've been tasting it, and it's
   definitely got twice the twisted flavor."

   Soulstorm, the highly volatile new game from Oddworld, is slated to
   explode in 2020.

   To feel the heat, please see our website at oddworld.com and follow us
   on Twitter and Facebook, where we will be revealing an all new Abe for
   Soulstorm. For details, please check oddworld.com.

   * New 'n' Tasty - 87% Metacritic and #11 Best PC Game of 2015

Official Merchandise

   Available now, a new range of official Oddworld merchandise to complete
   the set, with worldwide shipping.
