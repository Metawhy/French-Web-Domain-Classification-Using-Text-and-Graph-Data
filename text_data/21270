Whereabouts of Mina, Choa, and Yookyung since leaving AOA

   Mina - Didn't renew her contract with FNC and left AOA in 2019. She
   joined O&Ent and is planned to promote as an actress.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-08%2Bat%2B4.32.26%2BPM.png]
   Choa - Left AOA in 2017. Whereabouts unknown except her Instagram
   updates thanking her fans for birthday ads once a year.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-08%2Bat%2B4.32.34%2BPM.png]
   Yookyung - Left AOA in 2016. Worked as an instructor at a drum academy.
   Got her master's as a drum major. Uploads drum covers on Youtube.
   Joined an indie member 'P.AZIT' as a drummer.
   -
   Pann: Recent whereabouts of the members who left AOA
   1. [+178, -6] People criticize Choa too easily. It's true that she
   affected AOA in a negative way but it's not like she's promoting
   actively after leaving the group. Over the last 2 years she's been
   doing nothing. I think it was very tough for her to be in front of the
   public at that time. Instead of forcing yourself to continue promoting
   and then getting into a scandal, it's better to leave the group if you
   can't handle it.
   2. [+174, -3] What is Choa really up to?
   3. [+93, -48] I read that when Choa decided to leave the group, Jimin
   tried to convince her by saying, "Unnie can go on any variety show but
   our members Yuna, Hyejeong, and Chanmi still need more time so please
   hold on until we're stable enough." But Choa disappeared and announced
   her withdrawal. I know Choa had her own struggles but considering the
   other members, I don't see that that positively.
   4. [+79, -8] I doubt Choa left the group because of a man...
   5. [+68, -77] Didn't Choa leave the group because of a man? I just feel
   bad for the rest of the AOA members because they lost their main
   vocalist. I hope the members do well, they didn't seem to be paid well,
   too.
   6. [+67, -2] Mina left, too? I didn't know that.
   7. [+66, -1] They must've wanted to stay as a band instead of stripping
   and being a girl group. The last member did join a band again.
   8. [+43, -1] I'm a fan of a boy group and I'm not trying to shield Choa
   for affecting her group for dating. But I've always thought they must
   be struggling so much when they were promoting. They always pushed a
   sexy concept and wore short, tight outfits. Their fancams have really
   dirty sexual insults from men. The thumbnails are so provocative, too.
   Members like Choa and Hyejeong had it the worst. It must be really hard
   mentally to be a female idol.

'Superstar K' winner Kim Young Geun says some judges didn't give him promised
songs

   September 8, 2019
   Tweet
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-08%2Bat%2B4.16.51%2BPM.png]
   Q) What was the reason why you rarely promoted after winning 'Superstar
   K'?
   A) The prize money $200K was supposed to be used for the 7 judges. I
   was supposed to release 7 songs given by each judge. Only Brave Brother
   and FNC gave me songs. I haven't heard anything from the rest. I want
   to keep working with them.
   Summary: The prize money of winning 'Superstar K' is $500K. $300K is
   paid for tax and the rest of $200K money is used for the winner's debut
   album production. The $200K is paid to the 7 judges and the judges have
   to give the winner a song, total of 7 songs. The judges were Gummy,
   Gil, Ailee, Kim Yeon Woo, Kim Bum Soo, Brave Brother, and Han Sung Ho.
   Only Brave Brother and Han Sung Ho gave the winner songs.
   -
   Pann: Whereabouts of the last winner of Superstar K
   1. [+265, -0] Does that mean they took $200K for album production but
   didn't give him songs? Isn't that a scam?
   2. [+177, -0] I knew Kim Bum Soo had a bad character but what's with
   the rest ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
   3. [+163, -0] I used to find some of the judges likeable. I'm so
   disappointed.
   4. [+141, -0] What's with Gummy, Ailee, and Kim Yeon Woo ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I guess
   all celebrities are a trash.
   5. [+89, -0] Gummy is the most unexpected one. Disappointed.
   6. [+83, -0] Wow, they're robbers. This needs more attention. How can
   they crush a young man's dream like that? Swallowing all that money and
   ignoring him like that, what delinquents.
   7. [+68, -1] It's not like the singers don't have money. How can they
   be acting like that just because it's not their business? I hope the
   winner finds strength.
   8. [+60, -1] I used to criticize FNC all the time but they're clean
   with things like this.
   9. [+54, -0] The judges themselves aren't even doing that great. Gummy
   and Ailee? It makes me laugh ㅋㅋㅋㅋ The judges should be those who are
   able to compose songs with a mindset of a producer. They're all
   irresponsible. Fraud Mnet.
   10. [+53, -3] The judges whom you expect the least from gave him songs
   and the judges whom you expect the most from didn't give him songs.
   This is too much.

   Pann: Rookie idol groups that debuted in 2019
   1. [+69, -30] Honestly, I wish X1 doesn't do well. I don't hate them
   but if they do well, it'll be an example that manipulating doesn't
   matter as long as the fandom is big.
   2. [+65, -101] It's a bull that X1 is doing the best. I just hope they
   flop. Well, they're flopping anyways ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Their song is so sh*tty.
   3. [+64, -80] Itzy for girl group and X1 for boy group.
   4. [+23, -5] Judging by the results, it's true that X1 is doing the
   best. Those who are denying this are just jealous.
   5. [+21, -3] CIX's song is really good.
   6. [+17, -2] Huh, isn't it true that it's X1 for boy group and Itzy for
   girl group? Look at their results, it's true.

Itzy members' brand-name products

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-07%2Bat%2B9.54.33%2BAM.png]
   Pann: I envy Itzy golden spoons' brand-name products
   1. [+100, -0] Didn't Lia attend a really expensive school? Chaeryung is
   also from a rich family and Ryu Jin's father is the head of a hospital.
   2. [+76, -4] They always have at least one brand-name product in their
   Instagram photos. It makes me a little sad.
   3. [+72, -0] They're already golden spoons but the Louis Vuitton was
   sponsored.
   4. [+58, -0] Rich family finds a handsome/pretty spouse -> Their kids
   are pretty/fit -> Repeat -> Their kids are too good-looking to not be
   celebrities -> They debut as idols/actors -> They make bank. For some
   reason, our country has so many cases like this.
   5. [+22, -0] I heard that Lia and Chaeryung are from rich families.
   6. [+19, -0] Ryu Jin is well-off, too. Her father is the head of a
   hospital.
   7. [+17, -0] They have everything. Honestly, I'm so envious.
   8. [+16, -0] Guys, don't live your life by comparing yourself to
   others, especially to idols. What would you gain by comparing you to
   them?
   9. [+15, -0] Most rookie celebrities are golden spoons. Maybe because
   it's an arts field.
   10. [+12, -0] Brand-name products and being a golden spoon aren't the
   most valuable things in life. You just have to find something that's
   more valuable than money.
