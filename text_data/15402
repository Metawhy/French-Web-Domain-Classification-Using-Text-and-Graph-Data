   EXPERT OPINION : Angelique Songco

   Posted on 06 October 2015
   The manager of the only purely marine UNESCO World Heritage Site in
   Southeast Asia talks about the challenges and rewards of running a
   natural national treasure

How did you get started working in the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park? Were you
always passionate about the marine world? What have been the most significant
changes to the area since you started in 2001?

   My first visit to Tubbataha in 1981 as an open water diver showed me
   how wonderful the underwater world could be. Mesmerized by such beauty,
   I worked as a diving professional on dive boats that visited Tubbataha
   every year.  I did this for 7 or 8 years, and during that time I
   observed fishers using dynamite and cyanide, gathering turtles and
   birds and their eggs.  Some came from as far as Quezon Province, some
   600 km away.  It was a sad state of affairs because there was no
   enforcement to speak of.

   Without even understanding the ecological value of the marine
   environment, I was convinced that such beauty must be protected.  In
   2001, my application as manager of the park was accepted by the
   Tubbataha Management Board.  I was employed by WWF because the board
   had no funds to establish an office and man it.

   The reefs were less alive in 2001, I thought.  It was still fantastic
   in many places, mind you, but there appeared to be more coral damage
   than when I was there recently. My first move then was to meet the law
   enforcement team and ensure that individuals from various agencies
   worked as a unit.  I wanted to make sure that the park authorities were
   visible and performed their tasks with vigilance and professionalism.
   This has increased compliance and resulted in numerous arrests of
   illegal users.

Tubbataha is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. How has this designation helped in
terms of tourism and conservation?

   The Tubbataha Reefs was inscribed in the World Heritage (WH) list in
   1993.  It remains the only purely marine WH site in Southeast Asia
   today.  It was inscribed due to its outstanding universal value in
   terms of exceptional beauty, representation of significant ongoing
   ecological and biological processes, and importance for in situ
   conservation of biodiversity.  WH status grants international
   significance to the park; iit also bestows responsibility and
   obligation on the Philippine government to conserve and transfer its
   value to future generations.
   The WH brand has proven to be a strong influence on the number of
   visitations to the park.  Fifty-seven percent of tourists say
   Tubbataha’s WH status was an important factor in choosing to visit.
   The WH brand attracted support when the park was imperiled by illegal
   use in the past. A national and international constituency that
   supports its conservation joined protests, published articles, and
   wrote blogs, and contributed funds and technical support in order to
   protest misuse.

Can tourism and conservation really go hand in hand? What has been the case
in Tubbataha? Does it have a sustainable tourism strategy in place?

   Tourism first arrived in Tubbataha in the late ’70s.  It was the
   tourism industry that brought the attention of the government to the
   plight of Tubbataha and led to its establishment as a marine park in
   1988. Without the industry, we probably wouldn’t have known there was a
   place as beautiful as this—and we would not have known of its
   degradation in the hands of unscrupulous fishers.
   Today, tourism provides almost 50% of the funds to manage the park.  It
   remains the most stable source of funds so far.  Industry players know
   that our mutual interests lie in a park that is healthy and
   well-managed.  This is articulated in our tourism goal: to manage
   tourism to support conservation.  With a clear basis of unity, our
   relationship with the industry is marked by collaboration and
   cooperation.
   There is generally 98% compliance with regulations within the sector.
   A major factor could be the participatory rule-making, where the
   tourism sector is consulted on all rules and regulations and their
   amendments.  Dive operators support research, enforcement, and
   conservation awareness, and help build our network of support.

Tubbataha is strictly a no-take zone for fishers, but is open for tourism
activities. How did the fishing industry react to this in the beginning? How
has this impacted their lives?

   In the late ’80s, in the early days of the park, there was concern
   among the fishers in Cagayancillo and Puerto Princesa that only divers
   would be allowed in Tubbataha because they were rich, while the poor
   would be kept out.  Cagayancillo is the island municipality that has
   political jurisdiction over Tubbataha.  Many years of consultations,
   meetings, discussions, and other confidence-building activities were
   necessary for the local communities and fishers to at least listen to
   the side of park authorities.
   In a participatory evaluation conducted in 1998, fishers and local
   community members agreed to forego fishing access to the park in
   exchange for a share in the revenues, and preferential treatment in
   hiring personnel for park management. This agreement holds to this day.
   The economic incentive provided by the park, in the form of a 10% share
   in tourism revenues, is used by the local government unit to fund
   livelihood activities in the locality.  However, there is no study that
   shows whether those whose livelihood activities were affected by the
   establishment of the park are the same people who benefit from these
   agreements.

In 2013, a US navy ship was grounded on one of Tubbataha’s atolls, damaging
more than 2,000 square meters (sqm) of reef. What’s the situation now?

   The coral damage was 2,345 sqm.  The area is recovering quite well.
   The damaged area is surrounded by healthy reefs which seed the affected
   area. Today, small corals about 5-8 cm in size have colonized the
   affected area, and herbivorous fish keep the site from being overgrown
   with algae.

What role did digital communications (social media) play in highlighting that
2013 ship grounding incident and spurring action?

   Social media ensured that there was no hiding the incident; neither was
   there a chance to delay its announcement.  In the old days, a few days’
   cover-up would have been possible. Social media spread the news,
   quickly leading to the burgeoning of support from many sectors, both
   national and international. The WH status of the park figured in the
   discussions and strengthened the position of the park authorities in
   their demand for compensation.

What role does the private sector play in managing the park’s tourism
activities? How important is the private sector in helping bring about
sustainable tourism?

   As the main players in the tourism industry, the private sector plays a
   critical role in ensuring sustainability.  In Tubbataha, we provide no
   room for unsustainable tourism practices, clearly articulating our
   terms of engagement with the industry and vigilantly following through
   with established rules and guidelines. Since we share mutual interests
   with the private sector, they are able to profit from our conservation
   efforts, and we are able to generate the funds to help protect the
   park.

What does it cost to manage a marine park? Where do you get your funding—and
how do you manage your budget?

   It costs around US$356,000 annually to manage Tubbataha.  Part of this
   is sourced from tourism, some from grants and donations from the
   private sector and NGOs, and others from national government support.
   However, aside from tourism revenues, we have no other consistent
   source of funds.

How does Tubbataha compare to other world-renowned dive destinations? What
sets it apart?

   Because we exist in different contexts, it is hard and unfair to
   compare Tubbataha with other dive destinations.  Some are more
   accessible than we are, while others are even farther away from land.
   But I would say that our management regime, if anything, sets us apart
   from others.  Ours is a very inclusive arrangement, and we have matured
   in our relationship with the other stakeholders so that management in
   general is fun.

   Our Ambition

   The world has changed.
   Wildlife has halved in less than a generation. Natural habitats are
   being put under increasing pressure. And climate change is leading us
   into uncharted territory.
   But people have changed too.
   They’re more aware of the threat to essentials like food, water and
   clean air. They’re more ambitious, more innovative. And they’re backed
   by a growing number of corporations.

   efforts, and we are able to generate the funds to help protect the
   park.

What does it cost to manage a marine park? Where do you get your funding—and
how do you manage your budget?

   It costs around US$356,000 annually to manage Tubbataha.  Part of this
   is sourced from tourism, some from grants and donations from the
   private sector and NGOs, and others from national government support.
   However, aside from tourism revenues, we have no other consistent
   source of funds.

How does Tubbataha compare to other world-renowned dive destinations? What
sets it apart?

   Because we exist in different contexts, it is hard and unfair to
   compare Tubbataha with other dive destinations.  Some are more
   accessible than we are, while others are even farther away from land.
   But I would say that our management regime, if anything, sets us apart
   from others.  Ours is a very inclusive arrangement, and we have matured
   in our relationship with the other stakeholders so that management in
   general is fun.

   Our Ambition

   The world has changed.
   Wildlife has halved in less than a generation. Natural habitats are
   being put under increasing pressure. And climate change is leading us
   into uncharted territory.
   But people have changed too.
   They’re more aware of the threat to essentials like food, water and
   clean air. They’re more ambitious, more innovative. And they’re backed
   by a growing number of corporations.
