LIN Bus Networking - Transceivers and System-in-Package (SiP) Solutions

   Low-cost Local Interconnect Network (LIN) systems are used throughout
   the automobile in comfort, powertrain, sensor, and actuator
   applications.

   The modular Microchip LIN family ranges from simple transceiver ICs to
   complex system basis chips with LIN transceiver, voltage regulator and
   watchdog. At higher integration levels, the Microchip System-in-Package
   (SIP) solutions feature an AVR^®, an Arm^® Cortex^® M0+ microcontroller
   or PIC^® microcontroller, LIN transceiver, voltage regulator and
   watchdog in a single package.

Key Features

     * High level of integration – Depending on the individual integration
       level, we embed a large number of functions into our LIN devices,
       including LIN transceiver, voltage regulator, watchdog and
       microcontroller, so you don’t have to add these capabilities later.
     * Broad portfolio – Microchip gives you the broadest in-vehicle
       networking (IVN) product portfolio on the market with modular
       families at all integration levels to meet diverse application
       requirements.
     * Proven reputation – Approval of all major car manufacturers is
       available.
     * Advanced application support – A broad range of development tools
       give you a quick start on developing, prototyping and testing new
       designs.
     * Family footprint – The ATA6632/33/34 series of devices also provide
       a family footprint so designers can upgrade their designs with
       various devices within these series.

Audio and Voice

   Audio provides a means of communication, improves usability, and
   delivers entertainment. It can transform the mood of an environment,
   help us escape a noisy commute, assist us in machine interface and
   improve the quality of life for the visually impaired. Adding audio to
   your application enhances its ability to meet the needs of your
   customers. Bringing your product to market with the right mix of
   performance and price in the timeliest manner is important to your
   business. Microchip provides microcontrollers, development platforms
   and free software source code to help you bring a cost-effective design
   to market in the shortest time possible.

Ethernet Controllers

   Microchip's Ethernet 10/100 controllers include an integrated Ethernet
   MAC and PHY with a high-performance SRAM-like slave interface, as well
   as support for external MII and PCI interfaces. The simple, yet highly
   functional host bus interface provides a glue-less connection to most
   common 16-bit microprocessors and microcontrollers as well as 32-bit
   microprocessors with a 16-bit external bus. The controllers are also
   available with variable I/O voltages and multiple package options.

Ethernet Transceivers

   Microchip's 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet PHYs are high-performance,
   small-footprint, low-power 10Base-T/100Base-TX/1000Base-T transceivers
   designed specifically for today's consumer electronics, industrial and
   enterprise applications. These devices feature Energy-Efficient
   Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az) and Wake-On-LAN functionality, which provides
   system sleep modes for improved power savings. These devices have the
   industry's smallest footprint and consume up to 40% less power than
   existing transceivers. They have an integrated voltage regulator and
   ESD protection components to help reduce Bill of Material (BOM) costs.

   The LAN874XA family features deterministic loop back delay, assuring
   real-time system performance as well as cable diagnostics which reduce
   network installation costs.
