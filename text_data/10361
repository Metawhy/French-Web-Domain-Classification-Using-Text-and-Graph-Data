   Ellie Goulding wed her art dealer beau Caspar Jopling today in front of
   a star-studded guestlist in York on Saturday.  They married at York
   Minster - the ceremony started a little later than its 3pm schedule,
   with Ellie arriving at 3.25pm.

   Shortly after the ceremony, Ellie and her husband Caspar Jopling shared
   their official wedding photo. The couple released a candid image of
   them sharing a kiss just after exchanging vows. The newlyweds were
   surrounded by friends and family, and their adorable flower girls and
   pageboys, as they stood at the front of the cathedral. The official
   photo was taken by a favourite photographer of the royals - Matt
   Porteous. He recently photographed The Duchess of Cambridge's ‘Back to
   Nature’ garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. Here's a look back through
   the day's highlights - from royal guests, to sweet pre-wedding
   nerves....

   of Prince William and Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle
   and even Pippa Middleton and James Matthews.

   Ellie's bespoke gown wasn't the first thing on her mind when it came to
   her wedding day look. She explained to Vogue: “I was way too chilled
   about the dress at the start. I think I was scared and holding out for
   something really special. I’ve been working closely with my friend and
   stylist Nathan Klein to select the right shoes and mind-blowing
   jewellery from Bulgari. In truth, the dresses are so exquisite they
   really speak for themselves!”

 Buckingham Palace under renovation – take a peek inside some of the stunning
                                     rooms

The Queen's home is undergoing a £369million refurbishment

   October 05, 2018 - 16:52 BST Ainhoa Barcelona Renovations at The
   Queen's London home of Buckingham Palace are continuing – take a peek
   inside her palatial house

   Renovations are continuing to take place at Buckingham Palace. A video
   posted on the royal family's official Twitter account show around 3,000
   items from the Royal Collection being moved from the East Wing to
   elsewhere in the palace, other venues across the country and storage.
   Workers are tackling three of the wings in clockwise order, starting
   with the East, which features the world-famous balcony and has 200
   rooms spread over six floors.

   More than 200 paintings, 40 chandeliers, 1,000 glass and china pieces
   and 100 mirrors are being moved from the Yellow Drawing Room, the
   Principal Corridor, the Centre Room and the Chinese Dining Room so that
   the palace can be rewired. The bigger items, such as fireplaces, which
   cannot be removed will be protected by boxes while work continues
   around them. The repairs started in spring last year after it was
   decided that 3,000 metres of dangerous vulcanised rubber cabling would
   have to be ripped out to prevent a potentially "catastrophic" building
   failure.

   More than 200 paintings, 40 chandeliers, 1,000 glass and china pieces
   and 100 mirrors are being moved

   Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, previously said: "The
   palace's electrical cabling, plumbing and heating have not been updated
   since the 1950s and the building's infrastructure is now in urgent need
   of an overhaul to avoid the very real danger of catastrophic failure
   leading to fire or flood, and incalculable damage to the building and
   priceless works of art in the Royal Collection."

   Master of the Household Tony-Johnstone-Burt is overseeing the
   £369million public funds that are being spent on the Queen's home and
   said he is taking the responsibility "extremely seriously". He is
   convinced the repairs will be done within budget and time. "We all take
   the responsibility that comes with using public funds to do all this
   work on such a national icon like Buckingham Palace extremely seriously
   indeed," Mr Johnstone-Burt said.

   couple' trip

   "I am absolutely convinced that by making this investment in the palace
   now we will not only avert much more costly and potentially
   catastrophic failure of the building in the years to come but in the
   short term... will provide the opportunity for even more people to see
   this remarkable collection." Two lifts will be installed to improve
   access to visitors with mobility problems.

   Works on the Queen's rooms will not begin until 2025 to 2027. A senior
   royal official said: "The Queen, as you know, is immensely pragmatic
   and she wants to stay in the palace and she said, 'Let me know where
   you would like me to go' and she'll go wherever she agrees is
   appropriate."

   The Duke of York, the Princess Royal and the Earl and Countess of
   Wessex are all preparing to move out of Buckingham Palace while it
   undergoes the raft of repairs. The royals all have private apartments
   there as well as private offices. They will move across to nearby St
   James's Palace in the meantime, where Princess Anne already has rooms.
   The works will take around ten years to complete. In the meantime, it
   will be business as usual in the palace, with historic ceremonies such
   as the Changing of the Guard continuing.

   Ellie Goulding wed her art dealer beau Caspar Jopling today in front of
   a star-studded guestlist in York on Saturday.  They married at York
   Minster - the ceremony started a little later than its 3pm schedule,
   with Ellie arriving at 3.25pm.

   Shortly after the ceremony, Ellie and her husband Caspar Jopling shared
   their official wedding photo. The couple released a candid image of
   them sharing a kiss just after exchanging vows. The newlyweds were
   surrounded by friends and family, and their adorable flower girls and
   pageboys, as they stood at the front of the cathedral. The official
   photo was taken by a favourite photographer of the royals - Matt
   Porteous. He recently photographed The Duchess of Cambridge's ‘Back to
   Nature’ garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. Here's a look back through
   the day's highlights - from royal guests, to sweet pre-wedding
   nerves....

   Caspar's groomsmen were the first to arrive. Princess Eugenie's husband
   Jack Brooksbank was pictured amongst them.

   The high profile couple took royal inspiration for their event too.
   They used the same events company that organised the wedding receptions
   of Prince William and Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle
   and even Pippa Middleton and James Matthews.

   Ellie's bespoke gown wasn't the first thing on her mind when it came to
   her wedding day look. She explained to Vogue: “I was way too chilled
   about the dress at the start. I think I was scared and holding out for
   something really special. I’ve been working closely with my friend and
   stylist Nathan Klein to select the right shoes and mind-blowing
   jewellery from Bulgari. In truth, the dresses are so exquisite they
   really speak for themselves!”
