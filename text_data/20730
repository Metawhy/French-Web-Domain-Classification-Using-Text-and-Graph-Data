Background information

   The Committee was established on 26 February 2011 pursuant to
   resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF to oversee the relevant sanctions
   measures (arms embargo, assets freeze, travel ban) and to undertake the
   tasks set out by the Security Council in paragraph 24 of the same
   resolution. The mandate of the Committee was subsequently expanded by
   resolution 1973 (2011) Document PDF of 17 March 2011 to also apply to
   the measures decided in this resolution (ban on flights of Libyan
   aircraft, authorisation of the use of all measures commensurate to the
   specific circumstances to carry out inspections). The ban on flights of
   Libyan aircraft and the authorisation of the use of all measures for
   inspections to enforce the arms embargo were terminated by resolution
   2009 (2011) Document PDF of 16 September 2011 and resolution 2040
   (2012) Document PDF of 12 March 2012, respectively. On 19 March 2014,
   the Committee’s mandate was extended to the measures decided in
   resolution 2146 (2014) Document PDF , relating to attempts to illicitly
   export crude oil from Libya. The applicability of the measures decided
   in resolution 2146 (2014) was subsequently expanded to petroleum,
   including crude oil and refined petroleum products, by resolution 2362
   (2017) of 29 June 2017.

Further information on measures

   Arms embargo

   The arms embargo is a two-way embargo. The enforcement of the arms
   embargo was strengthened between March and September 2011 while the
   Council had authorized inspections. By resolution 2009 (2011) Document
   PDF of 16 September 2011 the Council eased the arms embargo by allowing
   the transfer of arms and related materiel of all types, intended solely
   for security or disarmament assistance to the Libyan authorities with
   prior notification and in the absence of a negative Committee decision.
   The same applies to the temporary export of small arms and light
   weapons and related materiel to Libya for the sole use of United
   Nations personnel, representatives of the media and humanitarian and
   development workers and associated personnel. By resolution 2095 (2013)
   Document PDF , the Council further eased the arms embargo concerning
   non-lethal military equipment. By resolution 2144 (2014) Document PDF ,
   the Council stressed compliance with the modalities of arms supplies,
   including ensuring that transfers reached and remained with the
   designated end-user. By resolution 2174 (2014) Document PDF , the
   Council reinforced the arms embargo.

   Targeted Sanctions

   By resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF and resolution 1973 (2011)
   Document PDF , the Security Council decided to impose individual
   targeted sanctions (a travel ban on individuals and an assets freeze on
   individuals and entities, as listed in the Annexes to the resolutions
   or designated by the Committee). Paragraphs 16 and 19 of resolution
   1970 (2011) Document PDF as well as paragraph 16 of resolution 2009
   (2011) Document PDF contain exemptions to those measures.

   The asset freeze measures, previously extending to six entities
   (Central Bank of Libya, Libyan Investment Authority, Libyan Foreign
   Bank, Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio and Libyan National Oil
   Corporation, Zueitina Oil Company), currently apply to funds, other
   financial assets and economic resources of two entities, the Libyan
   Investment Authority (LIA), and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio
   (LAIP), held outside of Libya prior to 16 September 2011. In resolution
   2040 (2012) Document PDF and subsequent resolutions, the Council
   directed the Committee, in consultation with the Libyan authorities, to
   review continuously the remaining measures with regard to those
   entities and decided that the Committee was, in consultation with the
   Libyan authorities, to lift the designation of those entities as soon
   as practical.

   By resolution 1973 (2011), the Security Council expanded the scope of
   the asset freeze to include the exercise of vigilance when doing
   business with Libyan entities, if States had information that provided
   reasonable grounds to believe that such business could contribute to
   violence and use of force against civilians.

   By resolution 2146 (2014) Document PDF , the Security Council decided
   to impose measures in relation to attempts to illicitly export crude
   oil on vessels designated by the Committee. The applicability of those
   measures was expanded to petroleum, including crude oil and refined
   petroleum products, in resolution 2362 (2017). Paragraph 12 of
   resolution 2146 (2014) allows the Committee to make exceptions to those
   measures. The Committee is mandated to designate vessels for some or
   all of the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 2146 (2014), on a
   case-by-case basis, for a period of ninety days, on the basis of
   paragraph 11 of resolution 2146 (2014).

   By resolutions 2174 (2014), 2213 (2015), 2362 (2017) and 2441 (2018),
   the Council expanded or further elaborated the criteria for designation
   of individuals or entities as subject to the travel ban and assets
   freeze.

   The Committee is mandated to consider designating individuals or
   entities on the basis of the criteria contained in paragraph 22 of
   resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF , paragraph 23 of resolution 1973
   Document PDF (2011), paragraph 11 of resolution 2146 Document PDF
   (2014), paragraph 4 of resolution 2174 Document PDF (2014), paragraph
   11 of resolution 2213 Document PDF (2015), paragraph 11 of resolution
   2362 (2017) and paragraph 11 of resolution 2441 (2018).

UN Report: Nature’s Dangerous Decline ‘Unprecedented’; Species Extinction
Rates ‘Accelerating’

   UN Report: Nature’s Dangerous Decline ‘Unprecedented’; Species
   Extinction Rates ‘Accelerating’
     * View Larger Image

   Current global response insufficient;
   ‘Transformative changes’ needed to restore and protect nature;
   Opposition from vested interests can be overcome for public good
   Most comprehensive assessment of its kind;
   1,000,000 species threatened with extinction

   PARIS, 6 May – Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in
   human history – and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating,
   with grave impacts on people around the world now likely, warns a
   landmark new report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform
   on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the summary of which
   was approved at the 7th session of the IPBES Plenary, meeting last week
   (29 April – 4 May) in Paris.

   “The overwhelming evidence of the IPBES Global Assessment, from a wide
   range of different fields of knowledge, presents an ominous picture,”
   said IPBES Chair, Sir Robert Watson. “The health of ecosystems on which
   we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than
   ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies,
   livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.”

   “The Report also tells us that it is not too late to make a difference,
   but only if we start now at every level from local to global,” he said.
   “Through ‘transformative change’, nature can still be conserved,
   restored and used sustainably – this is also key to meeting most other
   global goals. By transformative change, we mean a fundamental,
   system-wide reorganization across technological, economic and social
   factors, including paradigms, goals and values.”

   “The member States of IPBES Plenary have now acknowledged that, by its
   very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from those
   with interests vested in the status quo, but also that such opposition
   can be overcome for the broader public good,” Watson said.

   The IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services is the most comprehensive ever completed. It is the first
   intergovernmental Report of its kind and builds on the landmark
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of 2005, introducing innovative ways of
   evaluating evidence.

   Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three
   years, with inputs from another 310 contributing authors, the Report
   assesses changes over the past five decades, providing a comprehensive
   picture of the relationship between economic development pathways and
   their impacts on nature. It also offers a range of possible scenarios
   for the coming decades.

   Based on the systematic review of about 15,000 scientific and
   government sources, the Report also draws (for the first time ever at
   this scale) on indigenous and local knowledge, particularly addressing
   issues relevant to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.

   “Biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people are our common
   heritage and humanity’s most important life-supporting ‘safety net’.
   But our safety net is stretched almost to breaking point,” said Prof.
   Sandra Díaz (Argentina), who co-chaired the Assessment with Prof. Josef
   Settele (Germany) and Prof. Eduardo S. Brondízio (Brazil and USA).

   “The diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems, as
   well as many fundamental contributions we derive from nature, are
   declining fast, although we still have the means to ensure a
   sustainable future for people and the planet.”

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/334457422?autoplay=0&autopause=0

   The Report finds that around 1 million animal and plant species are now
   threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before
   in human history.

   The average abundance of native species in most major land-based
   habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900. More than 40%
   of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a
   third of all marine mammals are threatened. The picture is less clear
   for insect species, but available evidence supports a tentative
   estimate of 10% being threatened. At least 680 vertebrate species had
   been driven to extinction since the 16th century and more than 9% of
   all domesticated breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture had
   become extinct by 2016, with at least 1,000 more breeds still
   threatened.

     “Ecosystems, species, wild populations, local varieties and breeds
     of domesticated plants and animals are shrinking, deteriorating or
     vanishing. The essential, interconnected web of life on Earth is
     getting smaller and increasingly frayed,” said Prof. Settele. “This
     loss is a direct result of human activity and constitutes a direct
     threat to human well-being in all regions of the world.”

   To increase the policy-relevance of the Report, the assessment’s
   authors have ranked, for the first time at this scale and based on a
   thorough analysis of the available evidence, the five direct drivers of
   change in nature with the largest relative global impacts so far. These
   culprits are, in descending order: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2)
   direct exploitation of organisms; (3) climate change; (4) pollution and
   (5) invasive alien species.

   The Report notes that, since 1980, greenhouse gas emissions have
   doubled, raising average global temperatures by at least 0.7 degrees
   Celsius – with climate change already impacting nature from the level
   of ecosystems to that of genetics – impacts expected to increase over
   the coming decades, in some cases surpassing the impact of land and sea
   use change and other drivers.

   Despite progress to conserve nature and implement policies, the Report
   also finds that global goals for conserving and sustainably using
   nature and achieving sustainability cannot be met by current
   trajectories, and goals for 2030 and beyond may only be achieved
   through transformative changes across economic, social, political and
   technological factors. With good progress on components of only four of
   the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, it is likely that most will be
   missed by the 2020 deadline. Current negative trends in biodiversity
   and ecosystems will undermine progress towards 80% (35 out of 44) of
   the assessed targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, related to
   poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land (SDGs
   1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 14 and 15). Loss of biodiversity is therefore shown
   to be not only an environmental issue, but also a developmental,
   economic, security, social and moral issue as well.

   “To better understand and, more importantly, to address the main causes
   of damage to biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people, we need
   to understand the history and global interconnection of complex
   demographic and economic indirect drivers of change, as well as the
   social values that underpin them,” said Prof. Brondízio. “Key indirect
   drivers include increased population and per capita consumption;
   technological innovation, which in some cases has lowered and in other
   cases increased the damage to nature; and, critically, issues of
   governance and accountability. A pattern that emerges is one of global
   interconnectivity and ‘telecoupling’ – with resource extraction and
   production often occurring in one part of the world to satisfy the
   needs of distant consumers in other regions.”

   Other notable findings of the Report include:
     * Three-quarters of the land-based environment and about 66% of the
       marine environment have been significantly altered by human
       actions. On average these trends have been less severe or avoided
       in areas held or managed by Indigenous Peoples and Local
       Communities.
     * More than a third of the world’s land surface and nearly 75% of
       freshwater resources are now devoted to crop or livestock
       production.
     * The value of agricultural crop production has increased by about
       300% since 1970, raw timber harvest has risen by 45% and
       approximately 60 billion tons of renewable and nonrenewable
       resources are now extracted globally every year – having nearly
       doubled since 1980.
     * Land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of the global
       land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at
       risk from pollinator loss and 100-300 million people are at
       increased risk of floods and hurricanes because of loss of coastal
       habitats and protection.
     * In 2015, 33% of marine fish stocks were being harvested at
       unsustainable levels; 60% were maximally sustainably fished, with
       just 7% harvested at levels lower than what can be sustainably
       fished.
     * Urban areas have more than doubled since 1992.
     * Plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, 300-400 million
       tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes from
       industrial facilities are dumped annually into the world’s waters,
       and fertilizers entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than
       400 ocean ‘dead zones’, totalling more than 245,000 km2 (591-595) –
       a combined area greater than that of the United Kingdom.
     * Negative trends in nature will continue to 2050 and beyond in all
       of the policy scenarios explored in the Report, except those that
       include transformative change – due to the projected impacts of
       increasing land-use change, exploitation of organisms and climate
       change, although with significant differences between regions.

   The Report also presents a wide range of illustrative actions for
   sustainability and pathways for achieving them across and between
   sectors such as agriculture, forestry, marine systems, freshwater
   systems, urban areas, energy, finance and many others. It highlights
   the importance of, among others, adopting integrated management and
   cross-sectoral approaches that take into account the trade-offs of food
   and energy production, infrastructure, freshwater and coastal
   management, and biodiversity conservation.

   Also identified as a key element of more sustainable future policies is
   the evolution of global financial and economic systems to build a
   global sustainable economy, steering away from the current limited
   paradigm of economic growth.

   “IPBES presents the authoritative science, knowledge and the policy
   options to decision-makers for their consideration,” said IPBES
   Executive Secretary, Dr. Anne Larigauderie. “We thank the hundreds of
   experts, from around the world, who have volunteered their time and
   knowledge to help address the loss of species, ecosystems and genetic
   diversity – a truly global and generational threat to human
   well-being.”

Further Information on Key Issues from the Report

Scale of Loss of Nature

     * Gains from societal and policy responses, while important, have not
       stopped massive losses.
     * Since 1970, trends in agricultural production, fish harvest,
       bioenergy production and harvest of materials have increased, in
       response to population growth, rising demand and technological
       development, this has come at a steep price, which has been
       unequally distributed within and across countries. Many other key
       indicators of nature’s contributions to people however, such as
       soil organic carbon and pollinator diversity, have declined,
       indicating that gains in material contributions are often not
       sustainable .
     * The pace of agricultural expansion into intact ecosystems has
       varied from country to country. Losses of intact ecosystems have
       occurred primarily in the tropics, home to the highest levels of
       biodiversity on the planet. For example, 100 million hectares of
       tropical forest were lost from 1980 to 2000, resulting mainly from
       cattle ranching in Latin America (about 42 million hectares) and
       plantations in South-East Asia (about 7.5 million hectares, of
       which 80% is for palm oil, used mostly in food, cosmetics, cleaning
       products and fuel) among others.
     * Since 1970 the global human population has more than doubled (from
       3.7 to 7.6 billion), rising unevenly across countries and regions;
       and per capita gross domestic product is four times higher – with
       ever-more distant consumers shifting the environmental burden of
       consumption and production across regions.
     * The average abundance of native species in most major land-based
       habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.
     * The numbers of invasive alien species per country have risen by
       about 70% since 1970, across the 21 countries with detailed
       records.
     * The distributions of almost half (47%) of land-based flightless
       mammals, for example, and almost a quarter of threatened birds, may
       already have been negatively affected by climate change.

Indigenous Peoples, Local Communities and Nature

     * At least a quarter of the global land area is traditionally owned,
       managed, used or occupied by Indigenous Peoples. These areas
       include approximately 35% of the area that is formally protected,
       and approximately 35% of all remaining terrestrial areas with very
       low human intervention.
     * Nature managed by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities is under
       increasing pressure but is generally declining less rapidly than in
       other lands – although 72% of local indicators developed and used
       by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities show the deterioration
       of nature that underpins local livelihoods.
     * The areas of the world projected to experience significant negative
       effects from global changes in climate, biodiversity, ecosystem
       functions and nature’s contributions to people are also areas in
       which large concentrations of Indigenous Peoples and many of the
       world’s poorest communities reside.
     * Regional and global scenarios currently lack and would benefit from
       an explicit consideration of the views, perspectives and rights of
       Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities, their knowledge and
       understanding of large regions and ecosystems, and their desired
       future development pathways. Recognition of the knowledge,
       innovations and practices, institutions and values of Indigenous
       Peoples and Local Communities and their inclusion and participation
       in environmental governance often enhances their quality of life,
       as well as nature conservation, restoration and sustainable use.
       Their positive contributions to sustainability can be facilitated
       through national recognition of land tenure, access and resource
       rights in accordance with national legislation, the application of
       free, prior and informed consent, and improved collaboration, fair
       and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use, and
       co-management arrangements with local communities.

Global Targets and Policy Scenarios

     * Past and ongoing rapid declines in biodiversity, ecosystem
       functions and many of nature’s contributions to people mean that
       most international societal and environmental goals, such as those
       embodied in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the 2030 Agenda for
       Sustainable Development will not be achieved based on current
       trajectories.
     * The authors of the Report examined six policy scenarios – very
       different ‘baskets’ of clustered policy options and approaches,
       including ‘Regional Competition’, ‘Business as Usual’ and ‘Global
       Sustainability’ – projecting the likely impacts on biodiversity and
       nature’s contributions to people of these pathways by 2050. They
       concluded that, except in scenarios that include transformative
       change, the negative trends in nature, ecosystem functions and in
       many of nature’s contributions to people will continue to 2050 and
       beyond due to the projected impacts of increasing land and sea use
       change, exploitation of organisms and climate change.

Policy Tools, Options and Exemplary Practices

     * Policy actions and societal initiatives are helping to raise
       awareness about the impact of consumption on nature, protecting
       local environments, promoting sustainable local economies and
       restoring degraded areas. Together with initiatives at various
       levels these have contributed to expanding and strengthening the
       current network of ecologically representative and well-connected
       protected area networks and other effective area-based conservation
       measures, the protection of watersheds and incentives and sanctions
       to reduce pollution .
     * The Report presents an illustrative list of possible actions and
       pathways for achieving them across locations, systems and scales,
       which will be most likely to support sustainability. Taking an
       integrated approach:
     * In agriculture, the Report emphasizes, among others: promoting good
       agricultural and agroecological practices; multifunctional
       landscape planning (which simultaneously provides food security,
       livelihood opportunities, maintenance of species and ecological
       functions) and cross-sectoral integrated management. It also points
       to the importance of deeper engagement of all actors throughout the
       food system (including producers, the public sector, civil society
       and consumers) and more integrated landscape and watershed
       management; conservation of the diversity of genes, varieties,
       cultivars, breeds, landraces and species; as well as approaches
       that empower consumers and producers through market transparency,
       improved distribution and localization (that revitalizes local
       economies), reformed supply chains and reduced food waste.
     * In marine systems, the Report highlights, among others:
       ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management; spatial
       planning; effective quotas; marine protected areas; protecting and
       managing key marine biodiversity areas; reducing run- off pollution
       into oceans and working closely with producers and consumers.
     * In freshwater systems, policy options and actions include, among
       others: more inclusive water governance for collaborative water
       management and greater equity; better integration of water resource
       management and landscape planning across scales; promoting
       practices to reduce soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution
       run-off; increasing water storage; promoting investment in water
       projects with clear sustainability criteria; as well as addressing
       the fragmentation of many freshwater policies.
     * In urban areas, the Report highlights, among others: promotion of
       nature-based solutions; increasing access to urban services and a
       healthy urban environment for low-income communities; improving
       access to green spaces; sustainable production and consumption and
       ecological connectivity within urban spaces, particularly with
       native species.
     * Across all examples, the Report recognises the importance of
       including different value systems and diverse interests and
       worldviews in formulating policies and actions. This includes the
       full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples and Local
       Communities in governance, the reform and development of incentive
       structures and ensuring that biodiversity considerations are
       prioritised across all key sector planning.
     * “We have already seen the first stirrings of actions and
       initiatives for transformative change, such as innovative policies
       by many countries, local authorities and businesses, but especially
       by young people worldwide,” said Sir Robert Watson. “From the young
       global shapers behind the #VoiceforthePlanet movement, to school
       strikes for climate, there is a groundswell of understanding that
       urgent action is needed if we are to secure anything approaching a
       sustainable future. The IPBES Global Assessment Report offers the
       best available expert evidence to help inform these decisions,
       policies and actions – and provides the scientific basis for the
       biodiversity framework and new decadal targets for biodiversity, to
       be decided in late 2020 in China, under the auspices of the UN
       Convention on Biological Diversity.”

By the Numbers – Key Statistics and Facts from the Report

   General
     * 75%: terrestrial environment “severely altered” to date by human
       actions (marine environments 66%)
     * 47%: reduction in global indicators of ecosystem extent and
       condition against their estimated natural baselines, with many
       continuing to decline by at least 4% per decade
     * 28%: global land area held and/or managed by Indigenous Peoples ,
       including >40% of formally protected areas and 37% of all remaining
       terrestrial areas with very low human intervention
     * +/-60 billion: tons of renewable and non-renewable resources

IPBES Partner Comments

   “Nature makes human development possible but our relentless demand for
   the earth’s resources is accelerating extinction rates and devastating
   the world’s ecosystems. UN Environment is proud to support the Global
   Assessment Report produced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
   Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services because it highlights
   the critical need to integrate biodiversity considerations in global
   decision-making on any sector or challenge, whether its water or
   agriculture, infrastructure or business.”
   – Joyce Msuya, Acting Head, UN Environment

   “Across cultures, humans inherently value nature. The magic of seeing
   fireflies flickering long into the night is immense. We draw energy and
   nutrients from nature. We find sources of food, medicine, livelihoods
   and innovation in nature. Our well-being fundamentally depends on
   nature. Our efforts to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems must be
   underpinned by the best science that humanity can produce. This is why
   the scientific evidence compiled in this IPBES Global Assessment is so
   important. It will help us build a stronger foundation for shaping the
   post 2020 global biodiversity framework: the ‘New Deal for Nature and
   People’; and for achieving the SDGs.”
   – Achim Steiner, Administrator, United Nations Development Programme

   “This essential report reminds each of us of the obvious truth: the
   present generations have the responsibility to bequeath to future
   generations a planet that is not irreversibly damaged by human
   activity. Our local, indigenous and scientific knowledge are proving
   that we have solutions and so no more excuses: we must live on earth
   differently. UNESCO is committed to promoting respect of the living and
   of its diversity, ecological solidarity with other living species, and
   to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and
   intragenerational solidarity, for the perpetuation of humankind.”
   – Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, UNESCO

   “The IPBES’ 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services comes at a critical time for the planet and all its peoples.
   The report’s findings – and the years of diligent work by the many
   scientists who contributed – will offer a comprehensive view of the
   current conditions of global biodiversity. Healthy biodiversity is the
   essential infrastructure that supports all forms of life on earth,
   including human life. It also provides nature-based solutions on many
   of the most critical environmental, economic, and social challenges
   that we face as human society, including climate change, sustainable
   development, health, and water and food security. We are currently in
   the midst of preparing for the 2020 UN Biodiversity Conference, in
   China, which will mark the close of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and
   set the course for a post 2020 ecologically focused sustainable
   development pathway to deliver multiple benefits for people, the planet
   and our global economy. The IPBES report will serve as a fundamental
   baseline of where we are and where we need to go as a global community
   to inspire humanity to reach the 2050 Vision of the UN Biodiversity
   Convention “Living in harmony with nature”. I want to extend my thanks
   and congratulations to the IPBES community for their hard work, immense
   contributions and continued partnership.”
   – Cristiana Pasca Palmer, Executive Secretary, Convention on Biological
   Diversity

   “The Global Assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services adds a
   major element to the body of evidence for the importance of
   biodiversity to efforts to achieve the Zero Hunger objective and meet
   the Sustainable Development Goals. Together, assessments undertaken by
   IPBES, FAO, CBD and other organizations point to the urgent need for
   action to better conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and to the
   importance of cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration among
   decision-makers and other stakeholders at all levels.”
   – Jose Graziano da Silva, Director-General, Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations

Water scarcity

   UN-Water factsheet on water security >> UN-Water factsheet on water
   security

   Water scarcity already affects every continent. Around 1.2 billion
   people, or almost one-fifth of the world's population, live in areas of
   physical scarcity, and 500 million people are approaching this
   situation. Another 1.6 billion people, or almost one quarter of the
   world's population, face economic water shortage (where countries lack
   the necessary infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers).

   Water scarcity is among the main problems to be faced by many societies
   and the World in the XXIst century. Water use has been growing at more
   than twice the rate of population increase in the last century, and,
   although there is no global water scarcity as such, an increasing
   number of regions are chronically short of water.

   Water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. There is
   enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is
   distributed unevenly and too much of it is wasted, polluted and
   unsustainably managed.

     * Human Development Report 2006. UNDP, 2006

Water scarcity and the MDGs

   The way water scarcity issues are addressed impacts upon the successful
   achievement of most of the Millennium Development Goals:
     * MDG 1: Access to water for domestic and productive uses
       (agriculture, industry, and other economic activities) has a direct
       impact on poverty and food security.
     * MDG 2: Incidence of catastrophic but often recurrent events, such
       as droughts, interrupts educational attainment.
     * MDG 3: Access to water, in particular in conditions of scarce
       resources, has important gender related implications, which affects
       the social and economic capital of women in terms of leadership,
       earnings and networking opportunities.
     * MDGs 4 and 5: Equitable, reliable water resources management
       programmes reduce poor people's vulnerability to shocks, which in
       turn gives them more secure and fruitful livelihoods to draw upon
       in caring for their children.
     * MDG 6: Access to water, and improved water and wastewater
       management in human settlements, reduce transmission risks of
       mosquito-borne illnesses, such as malaria and dengue fever.
     * MDG 7: Adequate treatment of wastewater contributes to less
       pressure on freshwater resources, helping to protect human and
       environmental health.
     * MDG 8: Water scarcity increasingly calls for strengthened
       international cooperation in the fields of technologies for
       enhanced water productivity, financing opportunities, and an
       improved environment to share the benefits of scarce water
       management.

Water stress versus water scarcity

   Hydrologists typically assess scarcity by looking at the
   population-water equation. An area is experiencing water stress when
   annual water supplies drop below 1,700 m3 per person. When annual water
   supplies drop below 1,000 m3 per person, the population faces water
   scarcity, and below 500 cubic metres "absolute scarcity".
   Map: Global physical and economic water scarcity

   Source: World Water Development Report 4. World Water Assessment
   Programme (WWAP), March 2012.

   Water scarcity is defined as the point at which the aggregate impact of
   all users impinges on the supply or quality of water under prevailing
   institutional arrangements to the extent that the demand by all
   sectors, including the environment, cannot be satisfied fully. Water
   scarcity is a relative concept and can occur at any level of supply or
   demand. Scarcity may be a social construct (a product of affluence,
   expectations and customary behaviour) or the consequence of altered
   supply patterns - stemming from climate change for example.

Did you know?

     * Around 700 million people in 43 countries suffer today from water
       scarcity.
     * By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions
       with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's
       population could be living under water stressed conditions.
     * With the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world's
       population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030,
       including between 75 million and 250 million people in Africa. In
       addition, water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will
       displace between 24 million and 700 million people.
     * Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest number of water-stressed
       countries of any region.

UN initiatives that are helping to raise the issue...

     * World Water Day 2007: Coping with water scarcity
       World Water Day 2007 was dedicated to the theme "Coping with water
       scarcity". It highlighted the increasing significance of water
       scarcity worldwide and the need for increased integration and
       cooperation to ensure sustainable, efficient and equitable
       management of scarce water resources, both at international and
       local levels.
     * World Day to Combat Desertification 2013
       The theme of the 2013 World Day to Combat Desertification is
       drought and water scarcity. This year's slogan, "Don't let our
       future dry up", calls for everyone to take action to promote
       preparedness and resilience to water scarcity, desertification and
       drought. The slogan embodies the message that we are all
       responsible for water and land conservation and sustainable use,
       and that there are solutions to these serious natural resource
       challenges.

   crisis. It explores the impacts desertification has on the lives of
   many under the titles: Food (in)security – farming ourselves into
   extinction; Water (in)security – water scarcity triggers conflicts;
   Climate – changing the face of the earth changes the humanity;
   Migration – fight or flee; National Security – breaking down; Inaction,
   recipe for International Political and Economic chaos; Securitizing
   productive land – securing peace and stability; Investing in large
   scale restoration initiatives; Drought management measures;
   Institutional reforms; and culminates with Taking action now, a summary
   on what we can do now, to secure a future capable of dealing with
   drought risk.

   This report focuses on the importance of the drylands issue on the
   global agenda and its relation to other issues, including climate
   change, food security and human settlements. The report illustrates the
   many ways in which the UN system is identifying opportunities to
   mainstream the drylands agenda into the policy-making process. It sets
   out a common vision and agenda for UN-wide action on dryland management
   and its role in addressing climate change and food security through a
   positive development and investment approach. The report is aimed at a
   number of audiences, with certain objectives: (1) UN agencies
   themselves, to clarify the commitment made to drylands and act as a
   reference guide; (2) Governments of developed and developing countries,
   as a normative guide on the UN's position on, and commitment to, the
   development of drylands; (3) The private sector and donors, to
   encourage and inspire them to think about the viability and unique
   opportunities presented by drylands, and (4) Civil society, to
   encourage advocacy on the development of drylands, and empowerment of
   their populations.

   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). September 2010
   The use of reclaimed water in agriculture is an option that is
   increasingly being investigated and taken up in regions with water
   scarcity, growing urban populations and growing demand for irrigation
   water. This report presents an economic framework for the assessment of
   the use of reclaimed water in agriculture, as part of a comprehensive
   planning process in water resource allocation strategies to provide for
   a more economically efficient and sustainable water utilization. The
   case material presented provides a good field testing for the approach
   proposed.

   This report, based on a review of close to 20 cases of projects and
   investments mainly in Africa and Latin America, and supplemented with
   interviews with practitioners from both development and commercial
   financial institutions, concludes that there is a business case for
   improving risk management tools, which can specifically be related to
   the risks borne by water scarcity. While each organization must relate
   to water in its own capacity, the business case for the financial
   sector comes from acknowledging the potential risks associated with
   water scarcity and seeking possible opportunities for mitigating these
   risks.

   This report addresses the issues of the political economy of water
   reform and stresses the importance of "beyond the sector" policies. It
   analyzes the factors that drive the political economy of water reform
   and shows how some of them are changing in the MENA region in ways that
   could open up opportunities for water reform. The report discusses how
   the challenges and opportunities of the increasingly global economy may
   change the dynamics of water policy and how the changing demographics
   of the region (such as rapid urbanization, and increased education
   levels) might affect demand for water services.

   It is intended that this study constitute both a reference document for
   policy- and decision-making processes relating to the management of
   water supplies in the ESCWA region, and an evaluation tool for
   decisions that have already been made regarding the allocation of water
   resources to various sectors. As such, its beneficiaries will be
   primarily policy and decision makers involved in the daily management
   of the ESCWA region's diminishing water resources. It is hoped that the
   study will also be of use to other professionals in the field, and will
   inform the general public on the issues surrounding sectoral water
   allocation and how optimal allocation can ensure sustainable, equitable
   and efficient use of the region's water resources.

   "All are places where shortages of water contribute to poverty. They
   cause social hardship and impede development. They create tensions in
   conflict-prone regions. Too often, where we need water we find guns.
   [...] There is still enough water for all of us - but only so long as
   we keep it clean, use it more wisely, and share it fairly"

World population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in
2100

   21 June 2017, New York

   The current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6
   billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100,
   according to a new United Nations report being launched today. With
   roughly 83 million people being added to the world’s population every
   year, the upward trend in population size is expected to continue, even
   assuming that fertility levels will continue to decline.

   The World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, published by the UN
   Department of Economic and Social Affairs, provides a comprehensive
   review of global demographic trends and prospects for the future. The
   information is essential to guide policies aimed at achieving the new
   Sustainable Development Goals.

   Shifts in country population rankings

   The new projections include some notable findings at the country level.
   China (with 1.4 billion inhabitants) and India (1.3 billion
   inhabitants) remain the two most populous countries, comprising 19 and
   18% of the total global population. In roughly seven years, or around
   2024, the population of India is expected to surpass that of China.

   Among the ten largest countries worldwide, Nigeria is growing the most
   rapidly. Consequently, the population of Nigeria, currently the world’s
   7th largest, is projected to surpass that of the United States and
   become the third largest country in the world shortly before 2050.

   Most of the global increase is attributable to a small number of
   countries

   From 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world’s population
   growth will be concentrated in just nine countries: India, Nigeria, the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United
   Republic of Tanzania, the United States of America, Uganda and
   Indonesia (ordered by their expected contribution to total growth).

   The group of 47 least developed countries (LDCs) continues to have a
   relatively high level of fertility, which stood at 4.3 births per woman
   in 2010-2015. As a result, the population of these countries has been
   growing rapidly, at around 2.4 % per year. Although this rate of
   increase is expected to slow significantly over the coming decades, the
   combined population of the LDCs, roughly one billion in 2017, is
   projected to increase by 33 % between 2017 and 2030, and to reach 1.9
   billion persons in 2050.

   Similarly, Africa continues to experience high rates of population
   growth. Between 2017 and 2050, the populations of 26 African countries
   are projected to expand to at least double their current size.

   The concentration of global population growth in the poorest countries
   presents a considerable challenge to governments in implementing the
   2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to end poverty and
   hunger, expand and update health and education systems, achieve gender
   equality and women’s empowerment, reduce inequality and ensure that no
   one is left behind.

   Slower world population growth due to lower fertility rates

   In recent years, fertility has declined in nearly all regions of the
   world. Even in Africa, where fertility levels are the highest of any
   region, total fertility has fallen from 5.1 births per woman in
   2000-2005 to 4.7 in 2010-2015.

   Europe has been an exception to this trend in recent years, with total
   fertility increasing from 1.4 births per woman in 2000-2005 to 1.6 in
   2010-2015.

   More and more countries now have fertility rates below the level
   required for the replacement of successive generations (roughly 2.1
   births per woman), and some have been in this situation for several
   decades. During 2010-2015, fertility was below the replacement level in
   83 countries comprising 46 % of the world’s population. The ten most
   populous countries in this group are China, the United States of
   America, Brazil, the Russian Federation, Japan, Viet Nam, Germany, the
   Islamic Republic of Iran, Thailand, and the United Kingdom (in order of
   population size).

   Lower fertility leads also to ageing populations

   The report highlights that a reduction in the fertility level results
   not only in a slower pace of population growth but also in an older
   population.

   Compared to 2017, the number of persons aged 60 or above is expected to
   more than double by 2050 and to more than triple by 2100, rising from
   962 million globally in 2017 to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3.1 billion in
   2100.

   In Europe, 25% of the population is already aged 60 years or over. That
   proportion is projected to reach 35% in 2050 and to remain around that
   level in the second half of the century. Populations in other regions
   are also projected to age significantly over the next several decades
   and continuing through 2100. Africa, for example, which has the
   youngest age distribution of any region, is projected to experience a
   rapid ageing of its population. Although the African population will
   remain relatively young for several more decades, the percentage of its
   population aged 60 or over is expected to rise from 5% in 2017 to
   around 9% in 2050, and then to nearly 20% by the end of the century.

   Globally, the number of persons aged 80 or over is projected to triple
   by 2050, from 137 million in 2017 to 425 million in 2050. By 2100 it is
   expected to increase to 909 million, nearly seven times its value in
   2017.

   Population ageing is projected to have a profound effect on societies,
   underscoring the fiscal and political pressures that the health care,
   old-age pension and social protection systems of many countries are
   likely to face in the coming decades.

   Higher life expectancy worldwide

   Substantial improvements in life expectancy have occurred in recent
   years. Globally, life expectancy at birth has risen from 65 years for
   men and 69 years for women in 2000-2005 to 69 years for men and 73
   years for women in 2010-2015. Nevertheless, large disparities across
   countries remain.

   Although all regions shared in the recent rise of life expectancy, the
   greatest gains were for Africa, where life expectancy rose by 6.6 years
   between 2000-2005 and 2010-2015 after rising by less than 2 years over
   the previous decade.

   The gap in life expectancy at birth between the least developed
   countries and other developing countries narrowed from 11 years in
   2000-2005 to 8 years in 2010-2015. Although differences in life
   expectancy across regions and income groups are projected to persist in
   future years, such differences are expected to diminish significantly
   by 2045-2050.

   The increased level and reduced variability in life expectancy have
   been due to many factors, including a lower under-five mortality rate,
   which fell by more than 30 % in 89 countries between 2000-2005 and
   2010-2015. Other factors include continuing reductions in fatalities
   due to HIV/AIDS and progress in combating other infectious as well as
   non-communicable diseases.

   Large movements of refugees and other migrants

   There continue to be large movements of migrants between regions, often
   from low- and middle-income countries toward high-income countries. The
   volume of the net inflow of migrants to high-income countries in
   2010-2015 (3.2 million per year) represented a decline from a peak
   attained in 2005-2010 (4.5 million per year). Although international
   migration at or around current levels will be insufficient to
   compensate fully for the expected loss of population tied to low levels
   of fertility, especially in the European region, the movement of people
   between countries can help attenuate some of the adverse consequences
   of population ageing.

   The report observes that the Syrian refugee crisis has had a major
   impact on levels and patterns of international migration in recent
   years, affecting several countries. The estimated net outflow from the
   Syrian Arab Republic was 4.2 million persons in 2010-2015. Most of
   these refugees went to Syria’s neighbouring countries, contributing to
   a substantial increase in the net inflow of migrants especially to
   Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

   About the report

   The 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects is the 25th round of
   official UN population estimates and projections that have been
   prepared by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of
   Economic and Social Affairs.

   The 2017 Revision builds on previous revisions by incorporating
   additional results from the 2010 and 2020 rounds of national population
   censuses as well as findings from recent specialized sample surveys
   from around the world. The 2017 Revision provides a comprehensive set
   of demographic data and indicators that can be used to assess
   population trends at the global, regional and national levels and to
   calculate other key indicators for monitoring progress toward the
   Sustainable Development Goals.

Background information

   The Committee was established on 26 February 2011 pursuant to
   resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF to oversee the relevant sanctions
   measures (arms embargo, assets freeze, travel ban) and to undertake the
   tasks set out by the Security Council in paragraph 24 of the same
   resolution. The mandate of the Committee was subsequently expanded by
   resolution 1973 (2011) Document PDF of 17 March 2011 to also apply to
   the measures decided in this resolution (ban on flights of Libyan
   aircraft, authorisation of the use of all measures commensurate to the
   specific circumstances to carry out inspections). The ban on flights of
   Libyan aircraft and the authorisation of the use of all measures for
   inspections to enforce the arms embargo were terminated by resolution
   2009 (2011) Document PDF of 16 September 2011 and resolution 2040
   (2012) Document PDF of 12 March 2012, respectively. On 19 March 2014,
   the Committee’s mandate was extended to the measures decided in
   resolution 2146 (2014) Document PDF , relating to attempts to illicitly
   export crude oil from Libya. The applicability of the measures decided
   in resolution 2146 (2014) was subsequently expanded to petroleum,
   including crude oil and refined petroleum products, by resolution 2362
   (2017) of 29 June 2017.

Further information on measures

   Arms embargo

   The arms embargo is a two-way embargo. The enforcement of the arms
   embargo was strengthened between March and September 2011 while the
   Council had authorized inspections. By resolution 2009 (2011) Document
   PDF of 16 September 2011 the Council eased the arms embargo by allowing
   the transfer of arms and related materiel of all types, intended solely
   for security or disarmament assistance to the Libyan authorities with
   prior notification and in the absence of a negative Committee decision.
   The same applies to the temporary export of small arms and light
   weapons and related materiel to Libya for the sole use of United
   Nations personnel, representatives of the media and humanitarian and
   development workers and associated personnel. By resolution 2095 (2013)
   Document PDF , the Council further eased the arms embargo concerning
   non-lethal military equipment. By resolution 2144 (2014) Document PDF ,
   the Council stressed compliance with the modalities of arms supplies,
   including ensuring that transfers reached and remained with the
   designated end-user. By resolution 2174 (2014) Document PDF , the
   Council reinforced the arms embargo.

   Targeted Sanctions

   By resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF and resolution 1973 (2011)
   Document PDF , the Security Council decided to impose individual
   targeted sanctions (a travel ban on individuals and an assets freeze on
   individuals and entities, as listed in the Annexes to the resolutions
   or designated by the Committee). Paragraphs 16 and 19 of resolution
   1970 (2011) Document PDF as well as paragraph 16 of resolution 2009
   (2011) Document PDF contain exemptions to those measures.

   The asset freeze measures, previously extending to six entities
   (Central Bank of Libya, Libyan Investment Authority, Libyan Foreign
   Bank, Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio and Libyan National Oil
   Corporation, Zueitina Oil Company), currently apply to funds, other
   financial assets and economic resources of two entities, the Libyan
   Investment Authority (LIA), and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio
   (LAIP), held outside of Libya prior to 16 September 2011. In resolution
   2040 (2012) Document PDF and subsequent resolutions, the Council
   directed the Committee, in consultation with the Libyan authorities, to
   review continuously the remaining measures with regard to those
   entities and decided that the Committee was, in consultation with the
   Libyan authorities, to lift the designation of those entities as soon
   as practical.

   By resolution 1973 (2011), the Security Council expanded the scope of
   the asset freeze to include the exercise of vigilance when doing
   business with Libyan entities, if States had information that provided
   reasonable grounds to believe that such business could contribute to
   violence and use of force against civilians.

   By resolution 2146 (2014) Document PDF , the Security Council decided
   to impose measures in relation to attempts to illicitly export crude
   oil on vessels designated by the Committee. The applicability of those
   measures was expanded to petroleum, including crude oil and refined
   petroleum products, in resolution 2362 (2017). Paragraph 12 of
   resolution 2146 (2014) allows the Committee to make exceptions to those
   measures. The Committee is mandated to designate vessels for some or
   all of the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 2146 (2014), on a
   case-by-case basis, for a period of ninety days, on the basis of
   paragraph 11 of resolution 2146 (2014).

   By resolutions 2174 (2014), 2213 (2015), 2362 (2017) and 2441 (2018),
   the Council expanded or further elaborated the criteria for designation
   of individuals or entities as subject to the travel ban and assets
   freeze.

   The Committee is mandated to consider designating individuals or
   entities on the basis of the criteria contained in paragraph 22 of
   resolution 1970 (2011) Document PDF , paragraph 23 of resolution 1973
   Document PDF (2011), paragraph 11 of resolution 2146 Document PDF
   (2014), paragraph 4 of resolution 2174 Document PDF (2014), paragraph
   11 of resolution 2213 Document PDF (2015), paragraph 11 of resolution
   2362 (2017) and paragraph 11 of resolution 2441 (2018).

UN Report: Nature’s Dangerous Decline ‘Unprecedented’; Species Extinction
Rates ‘Accelerating’

   UN Report: Nature’s Dangerous Decline ‘Unprecedented’; Species
   Extinction Rates ‘Accelerating’
     * View Larger Image

   Current global response insufficient;
   ‘Transformative changes’ needed to restore and protect nature;
   Opposition from vested interests can be overcome for public good
   Most comprehensive assessment of its kind;
   1,000,000 species threatened with extinction

   PARIS, 6 May – Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in
   human history – and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating,
   with grave impacts on people around the world now likely, warns a
   landmark new report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform
   on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the summary of which
   was approved at the 7th session of the IPBES Plenary, meeting last week
   (29 April – 4 May) in Paris.

   “The overwhelming evidence of the IPBES Global Assessment, from a wide
   range of different fields of knowledge, presents an ominous picture,”
   said IPBES Chair, Sir Robert Watson. “The health of ecosystems on which
   we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than
   ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies,
   livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.”

   “The Report also tells us that it is not too late to make a difference,
   but only if we start now at every level from local to global,” he said.
   “Through ‘transformative change’, nature can still be conserved,
   restored and used sustainably – this is also key to meeting most other
   global goals. By transformative change, we mean a fundamental,
   system-wide reorganization across technological, economic and social
   factors, including paradigms, goals and values.”

   “The member States of IPBES Plenary have now acknowledged that, by its
   very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from those
   with interests vested in the status quo, but also that such opposition
   can be overcome for the broader public good,” Watson said.

   The IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services is the most comprehensive ever completed. It is the first
   intergovernmental Report of its kind and builds on the landmark
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of 2005, introducing innovative ways of
   evaluating evidence.

   Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three
   years, with inputs from another 310 contributing authors, the Report
   assesses changes over the past five decades, providing a comprehensive
   picture of the relationship between economic development pathways and
   their impacts on nature. It also offers a range of possible scenarios
   for the coming decades.

   Based on the systematic review of about 15,000 scientific and
   government sources, the Report also draws (for the first time ever at
   this scale) on indigenous and local knowledge, particularly addressing
   issues relevant to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.

   “Biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people are our common
   heritage and humanity’s most important life-supporting ‘safety net’.
   But our safety net is stretched almost to breaking point,” said Prof.
   Sandra Díaz (Argentina), who co-chaired the Assessment with Prof. Josef
   Settele (Germany) and Prof. Eduardo S. Brondízio (Brazil and USA).

   “The diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems, as
   well as many fundamental contributions we derive from nature, are
   declining fast, although we still have the means to ensure a
   sustainable future for people and the planet.”

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/334457422?autoplay=0&autopause=0

   The Report finds that around 1 million animal and plant species are now
   threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before
   in human history.

   The average abundance of native species in most major land-based
   habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900. More than 40%
   of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a
   third of all marine mammals are threatened. The picture is less clear
   for insect species, but available evidence supports a tentative
   estimate of 10% being threatened. At least 680 vertebrate species had
   been driven to extinction since the 16th century and more than 9% of
   all domesticated breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture had
   become extinct by 2016, with at least 1,000 more breeds still
   threatened.

     “Ecosystems, species, wild populations, local varieties and breeds
     of domesticated plants and animals are shrinking, deteriorating or
     vanishing. The essential, interconnected web of life on Earth is
     getting smaller and increasingly frayed,” said Prof. Settele. “This
     loss is a direct result of human activity and constitutes a direct
     threat to human well-being in all regions of the world.”

   To increase the policy-relevance of the Report, the assessment’s
   authors have ranked, for the first time at this scale and based on a
   thorough analysis of the available evidence, the five direct drivers of
   change in nature with the largest relative global impacts so far. These
   culprits are, in descending order: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2)
   direct exploitation of organisms; (3) climate change; (4) pollution and
   (5) invasive alien species.

   The Report notes that, since 1980, greenhouse gas emissions have
   doubled, raising average global temperatures by at least 0.7 degrees
   Celsius – with climate change already impacting nature from the level
   of ecosystems to that of genetics – impacts expected to increase over
   the coming decades, in some cases surpassing the impact of land and sea
   use change and other drivers.

   Despite progress to conserve nature and implement policies, the Report
   also finds that global goals for conserving and sustainably using
   nature and achieving sustainability cannot be met by current
   trajectories, and goals for 2030 and beyond may only be achieved
   through transformative changes across economic, social, political and
   technological factors. With good progress on components of only four of
   the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, it is likely that most will be
   missed by the 2020 deadline. Current negative trends in biodiversity
   and ecosystems will undermine progress towards 80% (35 out of 44) of
   the assessed targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, related to
   poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land (SDGs
   1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 14 and 15). Loss of biodiversity is therefore shown
   to be not only an environmental issue, but also a developmental,
   economic, security, social and moral issue as well.

   “To better understand and, more importantly, to address the main causes
   of damage to biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people, we need
   to understand the history and global interconnection of complex
   demographic and economic indirect drivers of change, as well as the
   social values that underpin them,” said Prof. Brondízio. “Key indirect
   drivers include increased population and per capita consumption;
   technological innovation, which in some cases has lowered and in other
   cases increased the damage to nature; and, critically, issues of
   governance and accountability. A pattern that emerges is one of global
   interconnectivity and ‘telecoupling’ – with resource extraction and
   production often occurring in one part of the world to satisfy the
   needs of distant consumers in other regions.”

   Other notable findings of the Report include:
     * Three-quarters of the land-based environment and about 66% of the
       marine environment have been significantly altered by human
       actions. On average these trends have been less severe or avoided
       in areas held or managed by Indigenous Peoples and Local
       Communities.
     * More than a third of the world’s land surface and nearly 75% of
       freshwater resources are now devoted to crop or livestock
       production.
     * The value of agricultural crop production has increased by about
       300% since 1970, raw timber harvest has risen by 45% and
       approximately 60 billion tons of renewable and nonrenewable
       resources are now extracted globally every year – having nearly
       doubled since 1980.
     * Land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of the global
       land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at
       risk from pollinator loss and 100-300 million people are at
       increased risk of floods and hurricanes because of loss of coastal
       habitats and protection.
     * In 2015, 33% of marine fish stocks were being harvested at
       unsustainable levels; 60% were maximally sustainably fished, with
       just 7% harvested at levels lower than what can be sustainably
       fished.
     * Urban areas have more than doubled since 1992.
     * Plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, 300-400 million
       tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes from
       industrial facilities are dumped annually into the world’s waters,
       and fertilizers entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than
       400 ocean ‘dead zones’, totalling more than 245,000 km2 (591-595) –
       a combined area greater than that of the United Kingdom.
     * Negative trends in nature will continue to 2050 and beyond in all
       of the policy scenarios explored in the Report, except those that
       include transformative change – due to the projected impacts of
       increasing land-use change, exploitation of organisms and climate
       change, although with significant differences between regions.

   The Report also presents a wide range of illustrative actions for
   sustainability and pathways for achieving them across and between
   sectors such as agriculture, forestry, marine systems, freshwater
   systems, urban areas, energy, finance and many others. It highlights
   the importance of, among others, adopting integrated management and
   cross-sectoral approaches that take into account the trade-offs of food
   and energy production, infrastructure, freshwater and coastal
   management, and biodiversity conservation.

   Also identified as a key element of more sustainable future policies is
   the evolution of global financial and economic systems to build a
   global sustainable economy, steering away from the current limited
   paradigm of economic growth.

   “IPBES presents the authoritative science, knowledge and the policy
   options to decision-makers for their consideration,” said IPBES
   Executive Secretary, Dr. Anne Larigauderie. “We thank the hundreds of
   experts, from around the world, who have volunteered their time and
   knowledge to help address the loss of species, ecosystems and genetic
   diversity – a truly global and generational threat to human
   well-being.”

Further Information on Key Issues from the Report

Scale of Loss of Nature

     * Gains from societal and policy responses, while important, have not
       stopped massive losses.
     * Since 1970, trends in agricultural production, fish harvest,
       bioenergy production and harvest of materials have increased, in
       response to population growth, rising demand and technological
       development, this has come at a steep price, which has been
       unequally distributed within and across countries. Many other key
       indicators of nature’s contributions to people however, such as
       soil organic carbon and pollinator diversity, have declined,
       indicating that gains in material contributions are often not
       sustainable .
     * The pace of agricultural expansion into intact ecosystems has
       varied from country to country. Losses of intact ecosystems have
       occurred primarily in the tropics, home to the highest levels of
       biodiversity on the planet. For example, 100 million hectares of
       tropical forest were lost from 1980 to 2000, resulting mainly from
       cattle ranching in Latin America (about 42 million hectares) and
       plantations in South-East Asia (about 7.5 million hectares, of
       which 80% is for palm oil, used mostly in food, cosmetics, cleaning
       products and fuel) among others.
     * Since 1970 the global human population has more than doubled (from
       3.7 to 7.6 billion), rising unevenly across countries and regions;
       and per capita gross domestic product is four times higher – with
       ever-more distant consumers shifting the environmental burden of
       consumption and production across regions.
     * The average abundance of native species in most major land-based
       habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.
     * The numbers of invasive alien species per country have risen by
       about 70% since 1970, across the 21 countries with detailed
       records.
     * The distributions of almost half (47%) of land-based flightless
       mammals, for example, and almost a quarter of threatened birds, may
       already have been negatively affected by climate change.

Indigenous Peoples, Local Communities and Nature

     * At least a quarter of the global land area is traditionally owned,
       managed, used or occupied by Indigenous Peoples. These areas
       include approximately 35% of the area that is formally protected,
       and approximately 35% of all remaining terrestrial areas with very
       low human intervention.
     * Nature managed by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities is under
       increasing pressure but is generally declining less rapidly than in
       other lands – although 72% of local indicators developed and used
       by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities show the deterioration
       of nature that underpins local livelihoods.
     * The areas of the world projected to experience significant negative
       effects from global changes in climate, biodiversity, ecosystem
       functions and nature’s contributions to people are also areas in
       which large concentrations of Indigenous Peoples and many of the
       world’s poorest communities reside.
     * Regional and global scenarios currently lack and would benefit from
       an explicit consideration of the views, perspectives and rights of
       Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities, their knowledge and
       understanding of large regions and ecosystems, and their desired
       future development pathways. Recognition of the knowledge,
       innovations and practices, institutions and values of Indigenous
       Peoples and Local Communities and their inclusion and participation
       in environmental governance often enhances their quality of life,
       as well as nature conservation, restoration and sustainable use.
       Their positive contributions to sustainability can be facilitated
       through national recognition of land tenure, access and resource
       rights in accordance with national legislation, the application of
       free, prior and informed consent, and improved collaboration, fair
       and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use, and
       co-management arrangements with local communities.

Global Targets and Policy Scenarios

     * Past and ongoing rapid declines in biodiversity, ecosystem
       functions and many of nature’s contributions to people mean that
       most international societal and environmental goals, such as those
       embodied in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the 2030 Agenda for
       Sustainable Development will not be achieved based on current
       trajectories.
     * The authors of the Report examined six policy scenarios – very
       different ‘baskets’ of clustered policy options and approaches,
       including ‘Regional Competition’, ‘Business as Usual’ and ‘Global
       Sustainability’ – projecting the likely impacts on biodiversity and
       nature’s contributions to people of these pathways by 2050. They
       concluded that, except in scenarios that include transformative
       change, the negative trends in nature, ecosystem functions and in
       many of nature’s contributions to people will continue to 2050 and
       beyond due to the projected impacts of increasing land and sea use
       change, exploitation of organisms and climate change.

Policy Tools, Options and Exemplary Practices

     * Policy actions and societal initiatives are helping to raise
       awareness about the impact of consumption on nature, protecting
       local environments, promoting sustainable local economies and
       restoring degraded areas. Together with initiatives at various
       levels these have contributed to expanding and strengthening the
       current network of ecologically representative and well-connected
       protected area networks and other effective area-based conservation
       measures, the protection of watersheds and incentives and sanctions
       to reduce pollution .
     * The Report presents an illustrative list of possible actions and
       pathways for achieving them across locations, systems and scales,
       which will be most likely to support sustainability. Taking an
       integrated approach:
     * In agriculture, the Report emphasizes, among others: promoting good
       agricultural and agroecological practices; multifunctional
       landscape planning (which simultaneously provides food security,
       livelihood opportunities, maintenance of species and ecological
       functions) and cross-sectoral integrated management. It also points
       to the importance of deeper engagement of all actors throughout the
       food system (including producers, the public sector, civil society
       and consumers) and more integrated landscape and watershed
       management; conservation of the diversity of genes, varieties,
       cultivars, breeds, landraces and species; as well as approaches
       that empower consumers and producers through market transparency,
       improved distribution and localization (that revitalizes local
       economies), reformed supply chains and reduced food waste.
     * In marine systems, the Report highlights, among others:
       ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management; spatial
       planning; effective quotas; marine protected areas; protecting and
       managing key marine biodiversity areas; reducing run- off pollution
       into oceans and working closely with producers and consumers.
     * In freshwater systems, policy options and actions include, among
       others: more inclusive water governance for collaborative water
       management and greater equity; better integration of water resource
       management and landscape planning across scales; promoting
       practices to reduce soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution
       run-off; increasing water storage; promoting investment in water
       projects with clear sustainability criteria; as well as addressing
       the fragmentation of many freshwater policies.
     * In urban areas, the Report highlights, among others: promotion of
       nature-based solutions; increasing access to urban services and a
       healthy urban environment for low-income communities; improving
       access to green spaces; sustainable production and consumption and
       ecological connectivity within urban spaces, particularly with
       native species.
     * Across all examples, the Report recognises the importance of
       including different value systems and diverse interests and
       worldviews in formulating policies and actions. This includes the
       full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples and Local
       Communities in governance, the reform and development of incentive
       structures and ensuring that biodiversity considerations are
       prioritised across all key sector planning.
     * “We have already seen the first stirrings of actions and
       initiatives for transformative change, such as innovative policies
       by many countries, local authorities and businesses, but especially
       by young people worldwide,” said Sir Robert Watson. “From the young
       global shapers behind the #VoiceforthePlanet movement, to school
       strikes for climate, there is a groundswell of understanding that
       urgent action is needed if we are to secure anything approaching a
       sustainable future. The IPBES Global Assessment Report offers the
       best available expert evidence to help inform these decisions,
       policies and actions – and provides the scientific basis for the
       biodiversity framework and new decadal targets for biodiversity, to
       be decided in late 2020 in China, under the auspices of the UN
       Convention on Biological Diversity.”

By the Numbers – Key Statistics and Facts from the Report

   General
     * 75%: terrestrial environment “severely altered” to date by human
       actions (marine environments 66%)
     * 47%: reduction in global indicators of ecosystem extent and
       condition against their estimated natural baselines, with many
       continuing to decline by at least 4% per decade
     * 28%: global land area held and/or managed by Indigenous Peoples ,
       including >40% of formally protected areas and 37% of all remaining
       terrestrial areas with very low human intervention
     * +/-60 billion: tons of renewable and non-renewable resources
       extracted globally each year, up nearly 100% since 1980
     * 15%: increase in global per capita consumption of materials since
       1980
     * >85%: of wetlands present in 1700 had been lost by 2000 – loss of
       wetlands is currently three times faster, in percentage terms, than
       forest loss.

   Species, Populations and Varieties of Plants and Animals
     * 8 million: total estimated number of animal and plant species on
       Earth (including 5.5 million insect species)
     * Tens to hundreds of times: the extent to which the current rate of
       global species extinction is higher compared to average over the
       last 10 million years, and the rate is accelerating
     * Up to 1 million: species threatened with extinction, many within
       decades
     * >500,000 (+/-9%): share of the world’s estimated 5.9 million
       terrestrial species with insufficient habitat for long term
       survival without habitat restoration
     * >40%: amphibian species threatened with extinction
     * Almost 33%: reef forming corals, sharks and shark relatives, and
       >33% marine mammals threatened with extinction
     * 25%: average proportion of species threatened with extinction
       across terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrate, invertebrate
       and plant groups that have been studied in sufficient detail
     * At least 680: vertebrate species driven to extinction by human
       actions since the 16th century
     * +/-10%: tentative estimate of proportion of insect species
       threatened with extinction
     * >20%: decline in average abundance of native species in most major

IPBES Partner Comments

   “Nature makes human development possible but our relentless demand for
   the earth’s resources is accelerating extinction rates and devastating
   the world’s ecosystems. UN Environment is proud to support the Global
   Assessment Report produced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
   Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services because it highlights
   the critical need to integrate biodiversity considerations in global
   decision-making on any sector or challenge, whether its water or
   agriculture, infrastructure or business.”
   – Joyce Msuya, Acting Head, UN Environment

   “Across cultures, humans inherently value nature. The magic of seeing
   fireflies flickering long into the night is immense. We draw energy and
   nutrients from nature. We find sources of food, medicine, livelihoods
   and innovation in nature. Our well-being fundamentally depends on
   nature. Our efforts to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems must be
   underpinned by the best science that humanity can produce. This is why
   the scientific evidence compiled in this IPBES Global Assessment is so
   important. It will help us build a stronger foundation for shaping the
   post 2020 global biodiversity framework: the ‘New Deal for Nature and
   People’; and for achieving the SDGs.”
   – Achim Steiner, Administrator, United Nations Development Programme

   “This essential report reminds each of us of the obvious truth: the
   present generations have the responsibility to bequeath to future
   generations a planet that is not irreversibly damaged by human
   activity. Our local, indigenous and scientific knowledge are proving
   that we have solutions and so no more excuses: we must live on earth
   differently. UNESCO is committed to promoting respect of the living and
   of its diversity, ecological solidarity with other living species, and
   to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and
   intragenerational solidarity, for the perpetuation of humankind.”
   – Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, UNESCO

   “The IPBES’ 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services comes at a critical time for the planet and all its peoples.
   The report’s findings – and the years of diligent work by the many
   scientists who contributed – will offer a comprehensive view of the
   current conditions of global biodiversity. Healthy biodiversity is the
   essential infrastructure that supports all forms of life on earth,
   including human life. It also provides nature-based solutions on many
   of the most critical environmental, economic, and social challenges
   that we face as human society, including climate change, sustainable
   development, health, and water and food security. We are currently in
   the midst of preparing for the 2020 UN Biodiversity Conference, in
   China, which will mark the close of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and
   set the course for a post 2020 ecologically focused sustainable
   development pathway to deliver multiple benefits for people, the planet
   and our global economy. The IPBES report will serve as a fundamental
   baseline of where we are and where we need to go as a global community
   to inspire humanity to reach the 2050 Vision of the UN Biodiversity
   Convention “Living in harmony with nature”. I want to extend my thanks
   and congratulations to the IPBES community for their hard work, immense
   contributions and continued partnership.”
   – Cristiana Pasca Palmer, Executive Secretary, Convention on Biological
   Diversity

   “The Global Assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services adds a
   major element to the body of evidence for the importance of
   biodiversity to efforts to achieve the Zero Hunger objective and meet
   the Sustainable Development Goals. Together, assessments undertaken by
   IPBES, FAO, CBD and other organizations point to the urgent need for
   action to better conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and to the
   importance of cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration among
   decision-makers and other stakeholders at all levels.”
   – Jose Graziano da Silva, Director-General, Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations

Water scarcity

   UN-Water factsheet on water security >> UN-Water factsheet on water
   security

   Water scarcity already affects every continent. Around 1.2 billion
   people, or almost one-fifth of the world's population, live in areas of
   physical scarcity, and 500 million people are approaching this
   situation. Another 1.6 billion people, or almost one quarter of the
   world's population, face economic water shortage (where countries lack
   the necessary infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers).

   Water scarcity is among the main problems to be faced by many societies
   and the World in the XXIst century. Water use has been growing at more
   than twice the rate of population increase in the last century, and,
   although there is no global water scarcity as such, an increasing
   number of regions are chronically short of water.

   Water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. There is
   enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is
   distributed unevenly and too much of it is wasted, polluted and
   unsustainably managed.

   Sources:
     * Human Development Report 2006. UNDP, 2006
     * Coping with water scarcity. Challenge of the twenty-first century.
       UN-Water, FAO, 2007

Water scarcity and the MDGs

   The way water scarcity issues are addressed impacts upon the successful
   achievement of most of the Millennium Development Goals:
     * MDG 1: Access to water for domestic and productive uses
       (agriculture, industry, and other economic activities) has a direct
       impact on poverty and food security.
     * MDG 2: Incidence of catastrophic but often recurrent events, such
       as droughts, interrupts educational attainment.
     * MDG 3: Access to water, in particular in conditions of scarce
       resources, has important gender related implications, which affects
       the social and economic capital of women in terms of leadership,
       earnings and networking opportunities.
     * MDGs 4 and 5: Equitable, reliable water resources management
       programmes reduce poor people's vulnerability to shocks, which in
       turn gives them more secure and fruitful livelihoods to draw upon
       in caring for their children.
     * MDG 6: Access to water, and improved water and wastewater
       management in human settlements, reduce transmission risks of
       mosquito-borne illnesses, such as malaria and dengue fever.
     * MDG 7: Adequate treatment of wastewater contributes to less
       pressure on freshwater resources, helping to protect human and
       environmental health.
     * MDG 8: Water scarcity increasingly calls for strengthened
       international cooperation in the fields of technologies for
       enhanced water productivity, financing opportunities, and an
       improved environment to share the benefits of scarce water
       management.

Water stress versus water scarcity

   Hydrologists typically assess scarcity by looking at the
   population-water equation. An area is experiencing water stress when
   annual water supplies drop below 1,700 m3 per person. When annual water
   supplies drop below 1,000 m3 per person, the population faces water
   scarcity, and below 500 cubic metres "absolute scarcity".
   Map: Global physical and economic water scarcity

   Source: World Water Development Report 4. World Water Assessment
   Programme (WWAP), March 2012.

   Water scarcity is defined as the point at which the aggregate impact of
   all users impinges on the supply or quality of water under prevailing
   institutional arrangements to the extent that the demand by all
   sectors, including the environment, cannot be satisfied fully. Water
   scarcity is a relative concept and can occur at any level of supply or
   demand. Scarcity may be a social construct (a product of affluence,
   expectations and customary behaviour) or the consequence of altered
   supply patterns - stemming from climate change for example.

Did you know?

     * Around 700 million people in 43 countries suffer today from water
       scarcity.
     * By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions
       with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's
       population could be living under water stressed conditions.
     * With the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world's
       population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030,
       including between 75 million and 250 million people in Africa. In
       addition, water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will
       displace between 24 million and 700 million people.
     * Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest number of water-stressed
       countries of any region.

UN initiatives that are helping to raise the issue...

     * World Water Day 2007: Coping with water scarcity
       World Water Day 2007 was dedicated to the theme "Coping with water
       scarcity". It highlighted the increasing significance of water
       scarcity worldwide and the need for increased integration and
       cooperation to ensure sustainable, efficient and equitable
       management of scarce water resources, both at international and
       local levels.
     * World Day to Combat Desertification 2013
       The theme of the 2013 World Day to Combat Desertification is
       drought and water scarcity. This year's slogan, "Don't let our
       future dry up", calls for everyone to take action to promote
       preparedness and resilience to water scarcity, desertification and
       drought. The slogan embodies the message that we are all
       responsible for water and land conservation and sustainable use,
       and that there are solutions to these serious natural resource
       challenges.

   and instability and calls for urgent action to support communities in
   crisis. It explores the impacts desertification has on the lives of
   many under the titles: Food (in)security – farming ourselves into
   extinction; Water (in)security – water scarcity triggers conflicts;
   Climate – changing the face of the earth changes the humanity;
   Migration – fight or flee; National Security – breaking down; Inaction,

   productive land – securing peace and stability; Investing in large
   scale restoration initiatives; Drought management measures;
   Institutional reforms; and culminates with Taking action now, a summary
   on what we can do now, to secure a future capable of dealing with
   drought risk.

   Coping with water scarcity. An action framework for agriculture and
   food security Coping with water scarcity. An action framework for
   agriculture and food security
   Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). August
   2012
   This report focuses on the importance of the drylands issue on the
   global agenda and its relation to other issues, including climate
   change, food security and human settlements. The report illustrates the
   many ways in which the UN system is identifying opportunities to
   mainstream the drylands agenda into the policy-making process. It sets
   out a common vision and agenda for UN-wide action on dryland management
   and its role in addressing climate change and food security through a
   positive development and investment approach. The report is aimed at a
   number of audiences, with certain objectives: (1) UN agencies
   themselves, to clarify the commitment made to drylands and act as a
   reference guide; (2) Governments of developed and developing countries,
   as a normative guide on the UN's position on, and commitment to, the
   development of drylands; (3) The private sector and donors, to

   Global Drylands: A UN system-wide response Global Drylands: A UN
   system-wide response
   United Nations Environment Management Group. October 2011
   This report focuses on the importance of the drylands issue on the
   global agenda and its relation to other issues, including climate
   change, food security and human settlements. The report illustrates the
   many ways in which the UN system is identifying opportunities to
   mainstream the drylands agenda into the policy-making process. It sets
   out a common vision and agenda for UN-wide action on dryland management
   and its role in addressing climate change and food security through a
   positive development and investment approach. The report is aimed at a
   number of audiences, with certain objectives: (1) UN agencies
   themselves, to clarify the commitment made to drylands and act as a
   reference guide; (2) Governments of developed and developing countries,
   as a normative guide on the UN's position on, and commitment to, the
   development of drylands; (3) The private sector and donors, to
   encourage and inspire them to think about the viability and unique
   opportunities presented by drylands, and (4) Civil society, to
   encourage advocacy on the development of drylands, and empowerment of
   their populations.

   PDF document - 1.86 MB]
   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). September 2010
   The use of reclaimed water in agriculture is an option that is
   increasingly being investigated and taken up in regions with water
   scarcity, growing urban populations and growing demand for irrigation
   water. This report presents an economic framework for the assessment of
   the use of reclaimed water in agriculture, as part of a comprehensive
   planning process in water resource allocation strategies to provide for
   a more economically efficient and sustainable water utilization. The
   case material presented provides a good field testing for the approach
   proposed.

   Institutions Challenges of Water Scarcity: A Business Case for

   This report, based on a review of close to 20 cases of projects and
   investments mainly in Africa and Latin America, and supplemented with
   interviews with practitioners from both development and commercial
   financial institutions, concludes that there is a business case for
   improving risk management tools, which can specifically be related to
   the risks borne by water scarcity. While each organization must relate
   to water in its own capacity, the business case for the financial
   sector comes from acknowledging the potential risks associated with
   water scarcity and seeking possible opportunities for mitigating these
   risks.

   analyzes the factors that drive the political economy of water reform
   and shows how some of them are changing in the MENA region in ways that
   could open up opportunities for water reform. The report discusses how
   the challenges and opportunities of the increasingly global economy may
   change the dynamics of water policy and how the changing demographics
   of the region (such as rapid urbanization, and increased education
   levels) might affect demand for water services.

   It is intended that this study constitute both a reference document for
   policy- and decision-making processes relating to the management of
   water supplies in the ESCWA region, and an evaluation tool for
   decisions that have already been made regarding the allocation of water
   resources to various sectors. As such, its beneficiaries will be
   primarily policy and decision makers involved in the daily management
   of the ESCWA region's diminishing water resources. It is hoped that the
   study will also be of use to other professionals in the field, and will
   inform the general public on the issues surrounding sectoral water
   allocation and how optimal allocation can ensure sustainable, equitable
   and efficient use of the region's water resources.

World population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in
2100

   21 June 2017, New York

   The current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6
   billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100,
   according to a new United Nations report being launched today. With
   roughly 83 million people being added to the world’s population every
   year, the upward trend in population size is expected to continue, even
   assuming that fertility levels will continue to decline.

   The World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, published by the UN
   Department of Economic and Social Affairs, provides a comprehensive
   review of global demographic trends and prospects for the future. The
   information is essential to guide policies aimed at achieving the new
   Sustainable Development Goals.

   Shifts in country population rankings

   The new projections include some notable findings at the country level.
   China (with 1.4 billion inhabitants) and India (1.3 billion
   inhabitants) remain the two most populous countries, comprising 19 and
   18% of the total global population. In roughly seven years, or around
   2024, the population of India is expected to surpass that of China.

   Among the ten largest countries worldwide, Nigeria is growing the most
   rapidly. Consequently, the population of Nigeria, currently the world’s
   7th largest, is projected to surpass that of the United States and
   become the third largest country in the world shortly before 2050.

   Most of the global increase is attributable to a small number of
   countries

   From 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world’s population
   growth will be concentrated in just nine countries: India, Nigeria, the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United
   Republic of Tanzania, the United States of America, Uganda and
   Indonesia (ordered by their expected contribution to total growth).

   The group of 47 least developed countries (LDCs) continues to have a
   relatively high level of fertility, which stood at 4.3 births per woman
   in 2010-2015. As a result, the population of these countries has been
   growing rapidly, at around 2.4 % per year. Although this rate of
   increase is expected to slow significantly over the coming decades, the
   combined population of the LDCs, roughly one billion in 2017, is
   projected to increase by 33 % between 2017 and 2030, and to reach 1.9
   billion persons in 2050.

   Similarly, Africa continues to experience high rates of population
   growth. Between 2017 and 2050, the populations of 26 African countries
   are projected to expand to at least double their current size.

   The concentration of global population growth in the poorest countries
   presents a considerable challenge to governments in implementing the
   2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to end poverty and
   hunger, expand and update health and education systems, achieve gender
   equality and women’s empowerment, reduce inequality and ensure that no
   one is left behind.

   Slower world population growth due to lower fertility rates

   In recent years, fertility has declined in nearly all regions of the
   world. Even in Africa, where fertility levels are the highest of any
   region, total fertility has fallen from 5.1 births per woman in
   2000-2005 to 4.7 in 2010-2015.

   Europe has been an exception to this trend in recent years, with total
   fertility increasing from 1.4 births per woman in 2000-2005 to 1.6 in
   2010-2015.

   More and more countries now have fertility rates below the level
   required for the replacement of successive generations (roughly 2.1
   births per woman), and some have been in this situation for several
   decades. During 2010-2015, fertility was below the replacement level in
   83 countries comprising 46 % of the world’s population. The ten most
   populous countries in this group are China, the United States of
   America, Brazil, the Russian Federation, Japan, Viet Nam, Germany, the
   Islamic Republic of Iran, Thailand, and the United Kingdom (in order of
   population size).

   Lower fertility leads also to ageing populations

   The report highlights that a reduction in the fertility level results
   not only in a slower pace of population growth but also in an older
   population.

   Compared to 2017, the number of persons aged 60 or above is expected to
   more than double by 2050 and to more than triple by 2100, rising from
   962 million globally in 2017 to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3.1 billion in
   2100.

   In Europe, 25% of the population is already aged 60 years or over. That
   proportion is projected to reach 35% in 2050 and to remain around that
   level in the second half of the century. Populations in other regions
   are also projected to age significantly over the next several decades
   and continuing through 2100. Africa, for example, which has the
   youngest age distribution of any region, is projected to experience a
   rapid ageing of its population. Although the African population will
   remain relatively young for several more decades, the percentage of its
   population aged 60 or over is expected to rise from 5% in 2017 to
   around 9% in 2050, and then to nearly 20% by the end of the century.

   Globally, the number of persons aged 80 or over is projected to triple
   by 2050, from 137 million in 2017 to 425 million in 2050. By 2100 it is
   expected to increase to 909 million, nearly seven times its value in
   2017.

   Population ageing is projected to have a profound effect on societies,
   underscoring the fiscal and political pressures that the health care,
   old-age pension and social protection systems of many countries are
   likely to face in the coming decades.

   Higher life expectancy worldwide

   Substantial improvements in life expectancy have occurred in recent
   years. Globally, life expectancy at birth has risen from 65 years for
   men and 69 years for women in 2000-2005 to 69 years for men and 73
   years for women in 2010-2015. Nevertheless, large disparities across
   countries remain.

   Although all regions shared in the recent rise of life expectancy, the
   greatest gains were for Africa, where life expectancy rose by 6.6 years
   between 2000-2005 and 2010-2015 after rising by less than 2 years over
   the previous decade.

   The gap in life expectancy at birth between the least developed
   countries and other developing countries narrowed from 11 years in
   2000-2005 to 8 years in 2010-2015. Although differences in life
   expectancy across regions and income groups are projected to persist in
   future years, such differences are expected to diminish significantly
   by 2045-2050.

   The increased level and reduced variability in life expectancy have
   been due to many factors, including a lower under-five mortality rate,
   which fell by more than 30 % in 89 countries between 2000-2005 and
   2010-2015. Other factors include continuing reductions in fatalities
   due to HIV/AIDS and progress in combating other infectious as well as
   non-communicable diseases.

   Large movements of refugees and other migrants

   There continue to be large movements of migrants between regions, often
   from low- and middle-income countries toward high-income countries. The
   volume of the net inflow of migrants to high-income countries in
   2010-2015 (3.2 million per year) represented a decline from a peak
   attained in 2005-2010 (4.5 million per year). Although international
   migration at or around current levels will be insufficient to
   compensate fully for the expected loss of population tied to low levels
   of fertility, especially in the European region, the movement of people
   between countries can help attenuate some of the adverse consequences
   of population ageing.

   The report observes that the Syrian refugee crisis has had a major
   impact on levels and patterns of international migration in recent
   years, affecting several countries. The estimated net outflow from the
   Syrian Arab Republic was 4.2 million persons in 2010-2015. Most of
   these refugees went to Syria’s neighbouring countries, contributing to
   a substantial increase in the net inflow of migrants especially to
   Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

   About the report

   The 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects is the 25th round of
   official UN population estimates and projections that have been
   prepared by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of
   Economic and Social Affairs.

   The 2017 Revision builds on previous revisions by incorporating
   additional results from the 2010 and 2020 rounds of national population
   censuses as well as findings from recent specialized sample surveys
   from around the world. The 2017 Revision provides a comprehensive set
   of demographic data and indicators that can be used to assess
   population trends at the global, regional and national levels and to
   calculate other key indicators for monitoring progress toward the
   Sustainable Development Goals.

Des déplacements de populations sans précédent

   Selon le rapport annuel de l'Agence des Nations Unies pour les
   réfugiés, les guerres, les violences et la persécution ont propulsé les
   déplacements forcés dans le monde vers un nouveau record, avec 68,5
   millions de personnes déracinées en 2017, soit une toutes les deux
   secondes - soit environ la population de la Thaïlande.
   infographie sur le nombre de personnes déracinées

   70,8 millions de personnes dans le monde ont été forcées de fuir leur
   foyer, soit un chiffre sans précédent. On compte parmi elles presque
   25,9 millions de réfugiés dont plus de la moitié a moins de 18 ans.

Un appel à la solidarité

   Dans un monde où chaque jour la violence force des milliers de familles
   à fuir leur foyer pour survivre, il est crucial pour la communauté
   internationale de se montrer solidaire avec les réfugiés.

« Avançons #Aveclesréfugiés »

   L’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés avait appelé en 2016 la
   communauté internationale à soutenir son travail et à se montrer plus
   solidaire avec les réfugiés. Dans le même esprit, elle appelle cette
   année les communautés et les entreprises partout dans le monde à «
   avancer avec les réfugiés », en parcourant une distance d’1 km à
   l’exemple des familles qui sont contraintes de prendre la route de
   l’exil. Participez dès aujourd’hui au défi mondial ou découvrez les
   autres initiatives que vous pouvez mettre en œuvre en solidarité
   #Aveclesréfugiés !

   En cette Journée mondiale des réfugiés, nous rendons hommage à la
   force, au courage et à la persévérance de millions de réfugiés. C'est
   aussi l'occasion pour le grand public de montrer son soutien aux
   familles déracinées.

   « En cette Journée internationale des femmes, veillons à ce que les
   femmes et les filles puissent concevoir des politiques, des services et
   des infrastructures ayant un effet sur notre vie. Et apportons notre
   soutien aux femmes et aux filles qui suppriment les obstacles à la
   création d’un monde meilleur pour toutes et pour tous.  » — António
   Guterres, Secrétaire général de l'ONU

Penser équitablement, bâtir intelligemment, innover pour le changement

   La Journée internationale des femmes, célébrée tous les ans le 8 mars,
   aura pour thème cette année « Penser équitablement, bâtir
   intelligemment, innover pour le changement ».

   La thématique propose de réfléchir aux moyens innovants permettant de
   faire progresser l’égalité des sexes et l’autonomisation des femmes,
   notamment dans les domaines suivants : les systèmes de protection
   sociale, l’accès aux services publics et la construction
   d’infrastructures durables.

   La réalisation des Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) exige des
   approches novatrices et intégrées, capables de rompre avec le statu
   quo, notamment lorsqu’il s’agit de la promotion de l’égalité des sexes
   et de l’autonomisation de toutes les femmes et les filles.

   Les actions en cours ne suffiront pas en effet pour l’instauration
   d’une Planète 50-50 d’ici 2030 et il devient donc primordial d’éliminer
   les obstacles structurels pour faire en sorte qu’aucune femme ni aucune
   fille ne soit laissée de côté.

   En ce qui concerne les domaines de la science, la technologie,
   l’ingénierie, les mathématiques et le design par exemple, les femmes
   restent sous-représentées. Cela a un impact négatif à long terme car
   empêche ces dernières d’être à l’origine ou d’avoir une incidence sur
   les innovations susceptibles de réduire certaines inégalités, en tenant
   compte des sexospécificités, et de favoriser ainsi une transformation
   structurelle positive de la société.

   En tenant compte et en évaluant les implications des hommes et des
   femmes dans toute action planifiée, il est en effet possible d’intégrer
   les préoccupations et expériences de ceux-ci à la conception, mise en
   œuvre, contrôle et évaluation des procédures et programmes dans toutes
   les sphères politiques, économiques et sociétales afin qu’ils en
   bénéficient de manière égale. Il est donc fondamental que les idées et
   les expériences des femmes interviennent également dans la conception
   et la mise en œuvre des innovations qui façonneront les sociétés de
   demain, y compris quand il s'agit de services bancaires mobiles,
   d’intelligence artificielle ou d’Internet des objets.

   Faisant écho au thème prioritaire de la 63e Commission de la condition
   de la femme (CSW63), la Journée internationale des femmes 2019
   s’adressera aux grands de l’industrie, aux jeunes pousses ou « startups
   » qui changent la donne, aux entrepreneurs sociaux, à toutes celles et
   tous ceux qui militent en faveur de l’égalité des sexes ainsi qu’aux
   femmes innovatrices, afin d’envisager comment l’innovation peut aider à
   éliminer les obstacles et à accélérer le progrès vers l’égalité des
   sexes, encourager les investissements dans des systèmes sociaux
   sensibles à la dimension de genre et bâtir des services et
   infrastructures adaptés aux besoins des femmes et des filles.

   Le 8 mars 2019, soyez à nos côtés pour promouvoir un avenir où
   l’innovation et la technologie ouvriront de nouvelles portes aux femmes
   et aux filles, afin qu’elles puissent jouer un rôle actif dans la mise
   en place de systèmes plus inclusifs, de services efficaces et
   d’infrastructures durables qui serviront à atteindre plus rapidement
   les ODD et l’égalité des sexes.

L'égalité entre les sexes et les objectifs de développement durable

   La Journée internationale des femmes est également l’occasion de
   réfléchir aux moyens d’accélérer le Programme 2030 et favoriser la mise
   en œuvre effective de ses objectifs, en particulier de l’objectif n.5
   (« parvenir à l’égalité des sexes et autonomiser toutes les femmes et
   les filles ») et de l’objectif n.4 (« assurer l’accès de tous à une
   éducation de qualité, sur un pied d’égalité, et promouvoir les
   possibilités d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie »).
   Parmi les cibles les plus importantes il s'agit notamment de :
     * Faire en sorte que toutes les filles et tous les garçons suivent
       d’ici à 2030, sur un pied d’égalité, un cycle complet
       d’enseignement primaire et secondaire gratuit et de qualité
       (objectif n.4).
     * Faire en sorte que toutes les filles et tous les garçons aient
       accès, d’ici à 2030, à des activités de développement et de soins
       de la petite enfance et à une éducation préscolaire de qualité qui
       les préparent à suivre un enseignement primaire (objectif n.4).
     * Mettre fin, dans le monde entier, à toutes les formes de
       discrimination à l’égard des femmes et des filles (objectif n.5).
     * Éliminer toutes les formes de violence à l’égard des femmes et des
       filles dans les sphères publique et privée, y compris la traite et
       l’exploitation sexuelle et autres type d’exploitation (objectif
       n.5).
     * Éliminer toutes les pratiques préjudiciables, telles que le mariage
       des enfants, le mariage précoce ou forcé et la mutilation génitale
       féminine (objectif n.5).

Déclaration de Windhoek

   Adoptée en 1991 à l'issue d'un séminaire pour le développement d'une
   presse africaine indépendante organisé à Windhoek (Namibie), cette
   Déclaration souligne l'importance d'une presse libre pour le
   développement et la préservation de la démocratie ainsi que pour le
   développement économique. Deux ans plus tard, l'Assemblée générale des
   Nations Unies a créé la Journée mondiale de la liberté de la presse.

Texte intégral de la Déclaration de Windhoek (3 mai 1991)

   Nous, les participants au Séminaire pour le développement d'une presse
   africaine indépendante et pluraliste organisé à Windhoek (Namibie), du
   29 avril au 3 mai 1991, conjointement par l'Organisation des Nations
   Unies et l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'éducation, la science
   et la culture,

   Rappelant la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme,

   Rappelant la résolution 59 (I) de l'Assemblée générale de
   l'Organisation des Nations Unies, en date du 14 décembre 1946, où la
   liberté de l'information est qualifiée de droit fondamental de l'homme,
   et sa résolution 45/76 A du 11 décembre 1990 sur l'information au
   service de l'humanité,

   Rappelant la résolution 25 C/104 de la Conférence générale de l'UNESCO
   de 1989, qui met l'accent sur la promotion "de la libre circulation des
   idées par le mot et l'image" à travers les nations et au sein de chaque
   nation,

   Prenant note avec appréciation des déclarations faites à l'ouverture du
   Séminaire par la Secrétaire générale adjointe des Nations Unies à
   l'information et par le Sous-Directeur général de l'UNESCO chargé de la
   communication, de l'information et de l'informatique,

   Exprimant également leurs sincères remerciements à l'Organisation des
   Nations Unies et à l'UNESCO d'avoir organisé le Séminaire,

   Exprimant également leurs sincères remerciements à tous les organes et
   organismes intergouvernementaux, en particulier le Programme des
   Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD), qui ont collaboré avec
   l'ONU et l'UNESCO à l'organisation du Séminaire,

   Exprimant leur gratitude au Gouvernement et au peuple de la République
   de Namibie pour leur généreuse hospitalité qui a favorisé le succès du
   Séminaire,

   Déclarons ce qui suit:
    1. Conformément à l'esprit de l'article 19 de la Déclaration
       universelle des droits de l'homme, la création, le maintien et le
       renforcement d'une presse indépendante, pluraliste et libre sont
       indispensables au progrès et à la préservation de la démocratie
       dans un pays, ainsi qu'au développement économique;
    2. Par presse indépendante doit s'entendre une presse sur laquelle le
       pouvoir public n'exerce ni emprise politique ou économique ni
       contrôle du matériel et des équipements nécessaires à la production
       et à la diffusion de journaux, magazines et périodiques;
    3. Par presse pluraliste doit s'entendre la suppression des monopoles
       de tous genres et l'existence du plus grand nombre possible de
       journaux, magazines et périodiques reflétant l'éventail le plus
       large possible des points de vue de la communauté;
    4. L'évolution actuelle d'un nombre croissant de pays africains vers
       la démocratie fondée sur le multipartisme est hautement appréciée
       et crée un climat favorable à l'éclosion d'une presse indépendante
       et pluraliste;
    5. Le mouvement qui se dessine dans le monde entier vers plus de
       démocratie, de liberté d'information et d'expression est une
       contribution fondamentale à la réalisation des aspirations de
       l'humanité;
    6. Dans l'Afrique d'aujourd'hui, en dépit des changements positifs
       intervenus dans certains pays, journalistes et éditeurs sont encore
       en lutte, dans de nombreux pays, à la répression -- assassinats,
       arrestations, détentions et censure -- et leur activité est
       entravée par toutes sortes de pressions politiques et économiques:
       restrictions à la fourniture du papier journal, autorisations
       préalables limitant la liberté de publication, restrictions de la
       délivrance de visas affectant la liberté de déplacement des
       journalistes, restriction du libre échange des nouvelles et de
       l'information, limitation de la libre circulation des journaux à
       l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des frontières nationales. Dans
       certains pays, le parti unique a une emprise totale sur
       l'information;
    7. Au moins 17 journalistes et éditeurs sont actuellement détenus dans
       des prisons africaines et 48 journalistes africains ont été tués
       dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions entre 1969 et 1990;
    8. L'Assemblée générale de l'Organisation des Nations Unies devrait
       inscrire à l'ordre du jour de sa prochaine session une question
       relative à la censure à l'effet de déclarer que celle-ci constitue
       une violation grave des droits de l'homme, ressortissant de la
       Commission des droits de l'homme;
    9. Il faudrait que les Etats africains soient encouragés à assurer les
       garanties constitutionnelles nécessaires à la liberté de la presse
       et à la liberté d'association;
   10. Pour encourager et consolider les changements positifs qui se
       produisent actuellement en Afrique et pour prévenir les
       développements négatifs, la communauté internationale - et plus
       particulièrement les organisations internationales
       (gouvernementales et non gouvernementales), les organismes.d'aide
       au développement et les associations professionnelles - devrait en
       priorité appuyer financièrement le développement et la création de
       journaux, magazines et périodiques non gouvernementaux qui
       reflètent la société dans son ensemble et les divers points de vue
       des communautés qu'ils desservent;
   11. Tout financement devrait viser à encourager à la fois le pluralisme
       et l'indépendance. En conséquence, ce financement ne devrait être
       accordé aux médias publics que lorsque les autorités garantissent,
       sur le plan constitutionnel et dans les fans, la liberté
       d'information et d'expression et l'indépendance de la presses;
   12. Afin que les libertés énumérées ci-dessus puissent être préservées,
       la création d'associations professionnelles, de syndicate de
       journalistes, d'associations d'éditeurs véritablement indépendants
       et représentatifs s'impose en priorité dans tous les pays africains
       où ces organismes n'existent pas encore;
   13. La législation nationale des pays africains, concernant les médias
       et les relations professionnelles, devrait être formulée de façon à
       garantir l'existence d'associations représentatives comme celles
       qui sont mentionnées ci-dessus et les conditions leur permettant de
       remplir leur importante mission, qui est de défendre la liberté de
       la presses;
   14. Les États africains qui ont incarcéré des journalistes du fait de
       leur activité professionnelle devraient, pour témoigner de leur
       bonne foi, les libérer sans tarder. Les journalistes qui ont été
       obligés de quitter leur pays devraient être libres d'y retourner et
       de reprendre leur activité professionnelle;
   15. La coopération entre éditeurs africains, d'une part, et entre
       éditeurs du Nord et du Sud (par le biais de jumelages par exemple),
       d'autre part, devrait être encouragée et soutenue;
   16. L'Organisation des Nations Unies et l'UNESCO, et en particulier le
       Programme international pour le développement de la communication,
       devraient, en coopération avec les organismes gouvernementaux
       (notamment le PNUD) et non gouvernementaux d'aide au développement,
       ainsi qu'avec les organisations non gouvernementales et les
       associations professionnelles compétentes, entreprendre d'urgence
       des recherches approfondies dans les domaines suivants:
         i. Identification, en vue de leur élimination ultérieure, des
            barrières écono miques qui entravent la création de nouveaux
            débouchés pour les médias,y compris les taxes, les droits de
            douane et les contingents qui restreignent l'importation
            d'articles comme le papier journal et les équipements
            d'impression, de composition et de traitement de textes, ainsi
            que les taxes sur la vente des journaux;
        ii. Formation de journalistes et de gestionnaires d'entreprises de
            presse, développement à leur intention d'institutions et de
            tours de formation professionnelle;
        iii. Identification des obstacles juridiques à la reconnaissance
            et au bon fonctionnement des syndicate ou associations de
            journalistes et d'éditeurs;
        iv. Établissement d'un registre des moyens de financement
            disponibles auprès des organismes d'aide au développement et
            autres institutions avec indication des conditions régissant
            l'octroi de ces fonds ainsi que des procédures à suivre pour
            en bénéficier;
         v. État par pays de la liberté de la presse en Afrique;
   17. Compte tenu de l'importance de la radio et de la télévision dans le
       domaine de l'information, l'Organisation des Nations Unies et
       l'UNESCO sont invitées à recommander respectivement à l'Assemblée
       générale et à la Conférence générale d'organiser un séminaire
       analogue à l'intention des journalistes et directeurs de programmes
       de ces médias en Afrique afro d'explorer les moyens d'appliquer à
       ceux-ci les mêmes principes d'indépendance et de pluralisme;
   18. La communauté internationale devrait contribuer à la réalisation et
       à la mise en application des initiatives et des projets figurant en
       annexe à la Déclaration;
   19. Le Secrétaire général de l'Organisation des Nations Unies et le
       Directeur général de l'UNESCO devraient transmettre la présente
       déclaration respectivement à la prochaine Assemblée générale de
       l'Organisation des Nations Unies et à la Conférence générale de
       l'UNESCO.
