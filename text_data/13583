  Research interests

   My main research interests are in data mining and knowledge discovery
   in databases with a focus on pattern discovery: pattern (sets)
   discovery, Constraint Satisfaction Problems and data mining, Natural
   Language Processing and data mining, preference queries (e.g.,
   skypatterns), unsupervised and supervised methods from several pattern
   languages (e.g., sequences, graphs). This research work benefits from
   close collaborations addressing applications in the fields of
   Chemoinformatics, Biomedical Text Analysis, Bioinformatics.
   I am a member of the Constraints, Data Mining, Graphs team at the GREYC
   lab.

  Publications

   A selection of publications is here.

  Some news

     * 2019: CPER Numnie supports (engineer) our work on text mining
       techniques to dicover relations in texts.
     * I am very pleased that our joint work on pattern interestingness in
       pattern mining was accepted at ECML/PKDD 2018.
     * June 2018: short visit of Ian Davidson, University of California,
       Davis, US. We exchanged on several declarative approaches for
       pattern sets.
     * May 2018: Project CNRS Mastodons QCM-BioChem (Quality in
       Consensualizing and Mining biological and chemical datasets) is
       launched (coordinators: Sarah Cohen-Boulakia and Albrecht
       Zimmermann).
     * 2018: We got collaborations and contracts with Inprimerie Nationale
       and Roullier compagnies.
     * May 2017: Project CNRS Mastodons Decade is launched (coordinator:
       Albrecht Zimmermann). Collaborative research on knowledge discovery
       and decision support to therapeutic chemistry (CERMN, GREYC, ICOA,
       IRISA, LI, LIFO, LIRIS, LORIA). We co-organized a scientific
       meeting in Lyon on November 2017 on interactive data mining, mining
       and learning with massively imbalanced data, mining and learning in
       bio/chemo-informatics. We got a KDD paper, Applied Data Science
       trac on our joint work.
     * Our joint work on skypattern mining is now publised at AIJ
     * With Marc Plantevit and Arnaud Soulet, we gave a tutorial on
       Preference-based Pattern Mining at ECML/PKDD 2016 (see here), ICFCA
       2017 (see here) and BDA 2017 (see here).
     * Under the PEPS Préfute project, we co-organized scientific meetings
       in Rennes on October 2016 and Nancy on November 2015. We have been
       talking about recent work by the pattern mining community,
       especially reporting basic reasearch results in this area. It was
       nice to listen talks by Tijl de Bie (Ghent University, Belgium),
       Albert Bifet (Télécom ParisTech, Paris), Mario Boley (Max Planck
       Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany), Wouter
       Duivesteijn (Ghent University, Belgium & TU Eindhoven, The
       Netherlands), Matthijs van Leeuwen (Leiden University, The
       Netherlands) and Jilles Vreeken (Saarland University, Saarbrücken,
       Germany) plus some others from the members of this successful
       2-year project.
     * I served as PC Chair of the 16ème conférence francophone sur
       l'Extraction et la Gestion des Connaissances (EGC 2016, Reims,
       France).

       University, Dayton, US, has been an invited professor at University
       of Caen in May 2015. We have lauchned a new scientific cooperation
       on contrast patterns in chemoinformatics.
     * ECML/PKDD 2014 was held in Nancy (France).
     * A mini-symposium on data mining was held on July 8-9th, 2014 at the
       GREYC lab.

       Computational Toxicology is now published in the book Contrast Data
       Mining: Concepts, Algorithms, and Applications edited by Guozhu
       Dong and James Bailey.
