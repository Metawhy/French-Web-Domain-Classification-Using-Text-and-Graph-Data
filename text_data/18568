Nintendo New 2DS XL review

   Cut back in the right places, improved in others.
   Review by Thomas Morgan, Senior Staff Writer, Digital Foundry
   Updated on 25 June 2017

   Six years since the 3DS first launched, Nintendo's New 2DS XL lets the
   handheld go out on a high. Forget the standard 2DS - a heavily stripped
   back version of the console released at a budget price - the 2DS XL is
   a very different beast. It includes almost all the features of the New
   3DS XL, including its extra processing power and 256MB of RAM. You get
   the C-stick controls and ZL/ZR shoulder buttons as well, plus Amiibo
   NFC support. But as the name of the machine suggests, the obvious
   change is the complete removal of the auto-stereoscopic 3D display, and
   the head-tracking technology.

   These cutbacks translate to a lower �130 price-tag, shaving a good
   �30-40 off the New 3DS XL, and making it less than half the price of a
   Nintendo Switch. For anyone itching to check out a huge catalogue of
   3DS and DS games, and just aren't fussed about 3D, there's a lot to
   like - fundamentally, this is a well-built piece of kit. However, there
   are a couple of nitpicks too.

   Nintendo could have stuck with its existing New 3DS XL design, but
   instead, the platform holder has made a number of changes. The New 2DS
   XL's processing power remains the same, but the exterior casing has
   been revamped. It's simplistic - as befits its price-point - again
   using mostly matte plastics for the body, and a redesigned hinge that
   lets both screens lay out evenly when snapped to the last position. The
   only criticism is that there's still a wobble to that top screen when
   moving around, with the hinge not quite as solid as it should have been
   - but that's a long-running problem with Nintendo's clamshell designs.

   Otherwise, it's as robust a design as you'd expect from the 3DS line.
   And aesthetically, there's some nice touches too. A stylish striped
   texture runs across on top, wrapped around by a glossy coloured edge,
   turquoise in the case of our review unit. A drawback here is that
   there's no option for custom faceplates, supposing you don't like the
   default style.

   In terms of inputs and connections, the New 2DS XL retains all the
   features of its more expensive sibling. It feels much the same. You get
   the same clicky feedback of the d-pad and face buttons, and the unique
   circle pad makes a return as-is. In terms of inputs, everything's moved
   to the bottom edge here as well.

   For once, the game cartridge slot now has a physical, plastic cover at
   the bottom that neighbours the microSD slot, which has a 4GB card
   already installed. Next, the stylus sits next to a 3.5mm headphone
   port, while a power button protrudes from the far right, alongside LEDs
   for power, charging and WiFi. Beyond that, the volume slider sits on
   the left flank of the unit, though of course, the 3D slider - which
   usually mirrors that - is missing on the right.

   There's one very pleasant surprise with the New 2DS XL; it has a
   genuine advantage in terms of size and weight. Height-wise, it's about
   a centimetre smaller than the New 3DS XL, thanks to a new folding
   design that relocates the camera to the hinge, saving some room. It's
   not a big deal, but more impressive is the substantial weight
   reduction, down to 260g compared to its sibling's 329g, and the 398g of
   a Switch with Joycons attached. However, a snag to the redesign
   concerns the speakers: these move from either side of the top screen to
   the bottom edge, the side-effect being the openings can at times get
   muffled by your palms.

   Going into this review, we were concerned that in order to bring the
   price-point down, Nintendo might have cut corners on the displays -
   beyond removing the 3D functionality. Thankfully, the screen is very
   close in quality to the New 3DS XL model; you get an effective 400x240
   resolution up top, and 320x240 on the lower resistive touch screen.

   The top screen stacks up nicely against other 3DS products: it's
   colourful and punchy. But of course, we've since been spoilt by the
   Switch's six-inch IPS panel, meaning there's a sense of regression
   going back to the 2DS XL. For one, viewing angles aren't great, there's
   ghosting on grey-to-grey transitions, and it just lacks the sheer
   brightness of Switch's display.
   inhand
   In hand, the lightness of the New 2DS XL is felt. Screen quality isn't
   state-of-the-art and the TN panel isn't that bright at 147 nits, but it
   compares well with other displays in the 3DS family.

   In fact it looks positively dull if you take it outside, even on max
   brightness. For perspective, we measured a peak brightness level of 147
   nits on the 2DS XL, compared to 368 nits on Switch. It makes a big
   difference, but as long as you're not out in blazing sunlight, there's
   still plenty of contrast and punch to the screen in most gaming
   conditions. Our review unit seems to have a TN panel, but besides
   restrictive viewing angles, it's still a very strong-looking display.

   Thankfully, there are no perceptible cutbacks to battery life, either.
   The official line from Nintendo is that the New 2DS XL gets a similar
   play-time to regular 3DS models; a range of three to five and half
   hours. We ramped up the brightness level to the maximum, left WiFi
   enabled and set volume to 75 per cent. Booting up Mario Kart 7, we
   clocked in three hours and 50 minutes of continuous play of the game
   before the power cut out. It's maybe a shame that stripping the extras
   from a 3DS doesn't qualify us for more battery life. As a stress-test
   though, the turnout is on par, or very slightly higher than the other
   models.
   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   It's not for the faint-hearted.

   Nintendo's come a long way in refining its 3DS across the last six
   years. The fact is that there's now several ways to tap into its large
   games catalogue, and the New 2DS XL stands as one of the best options.
   Price is a factor of course, and ideally we'd always want everything in
   one package, with no compromise - but if you've got zero interest in
   ever using stereoscopic 3D, the argument for checking out the 2DS XL is
   much easier. There are even some unique advantages going this route. If
   you can get on with its design, you have all the functionality of a
   more expensive handheld, but in a noticeably lighter profile.
   Everything is thankfully included in the box too, from the charger to
   the 4GB SD card, so there's no skimping there, as we've seen in past.

   Overall then, Nintendo's New 2DS XL offers a significant upgrade over
   the entry level 2DS in terms of build quality, processing power and
   form-factor - but with the bargain basement model available for just
   �75 these days, an extra �55 on top is a significantly higher level of
   investment. It sits as a midway point between 2DS and 3DS XL, in terms
   of both pricing and spec. From our perspective, we'd still opt for the
   New 3DS XL as the unit of choice - the front-facing speakers are
   preferable, and from time to time, it's interesting to see how titles
   use its 3D features. But there's no real deal-breaker for the New 2DS
   XL. As a way to complement the more expensive Switch, this is a
   respectable way to enjoy the 3DS' massive library of excellent
   software.

Xbox boss Phil Spencer: the big interview

   "Scorpio is designed as a 4K console…"
   Interview by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor
   Updated on 15 June 2016

   Microsoft's E3 media briefing was strong, I thought, although its
   impact was dulled by a pretty spectacular set of leaks that not only
   revealed the existence of the Xbox One S and Scorpio ahead of time, but
   the running order of the show.

   On stage, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was determined to tell the whole
   story, and he did well, announcing Xbox Play Anywhere, which should
   help boost the potential player base of all those "Xbox One and Windows
   10 exclusive" games we heard about this week.

   And yet, the announcement of the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio left
   plenty of questions unanswered. Perhaps chief among them is this: with
   Project Scorpio looming over the horizon, who in their right mind will
   now buy the Xbox One S?

   We know Project Scorpio offers an impressive six teraflops of power,
   but one crucial aspect of its innards remains shrouded in mystery: the
   RAM.

   And surely with those beefy specs the Scorpio, or whatever it ends up
   being called, signals the arrival of the next-generation of consoles,
   not some mid-generational refresh, as we perhaps expect of the rival
   PlayStation 4 Neo. And if it does, won't developers want to make the
   most of all that power, leaving poor old Xbox One owners behind?

   Not so, Phil Spencer told me in an interview at E3 this week. Here,
   Spencer explains who, exactly, Project Scorpio is for, why Xbox One S
   is a console people should be interested in, and about those leaks...
   1 Phil Spencer on stage during Microsofts E3 2016 media briefing.

   I enjoyed your conference and I thought it was strong...

   Phil Spencer: Thank you. But... here it comes...

   The edge was taken of some announcements, particularly Scorpio, by the
   huge number of leaks you suffered. Was that something you felt as the
   conference took place, or detected in your analysis of the reaction?

   Phil Spencer: I thought the excitement in the arena was high. We've got
   the fans there. We do this fan event on Saturday night where we bring
   people out so we can give them tickets to the show and get them into
   E3. Last year we had a few hundred people show up. This year we had 800
   people show up on Saturday. So even with the leaks, we looked at our
   numbers online in terms of how many people watched and they were higher
   than ever. So I think there was a lot of excitement and anticipation.

   In some ways you guys in your secret ways find the leaks and are able
   to publish those things, it doesn't really become real until it's
   validated because we stood on stage and said something. All that said,
   honestly, I like us to be able to control our message and say it in
   complete.

   The leaks are a bummer. The things that are more of a bummer are the
   leaks that come out that are inaccurate, or part of a story, because
   then, without being able to tell the whole story, there could be
   certain parts of the plan - you could laugh then and say won't you leak
   everything like we did this time, it's not an issue - but you know what
   I mean. If somebody finds a certain part of it and it doesn't all tie
   together, that's why I think the opportunity to say something on stage.
   We need that.

   I felt the energy in the centre was great. Viewership was really high.
   But honestly, we gotta find a way to control more of the leaks, yeah.

   I stood on stage in front of the 4000 people at Xbox in February and
   detailed Scorpio and said here's what it was. There are people inside
   the company who would say, that's crazy. Of course it's going to leak.
   But I also, a couple months before we announced we were going to ship
   an Xbox One without Kinect in it, did the same thing and everybody
   said, if you do that everybody will stop buying now, you can't do this,
   it's gonna leak.

   The work that happens month after month the team does is driven by
   thousands of people who are engaged and believe in the plan, and I
   don't know how to be a leader for that organisation if I can't
   communicate with them openly on what's happening. I don't think our
   team leaked, but doing things like that, if things leak, I will take
   the leak over not being able to be open and transparent with the team
   that's actually going to do the work, because their hearts and minds
   are infinitely more important to our long-term success than a couple
   weeks or days before our announcement, a leak going out.

   So it's always this balance. I choose to try to be as open and
   transparent as we can be when we've made our decisions about what we're
   going to do.

   You announced Xbox One S. I hear there's extra processing power...

   Phil Spencer: I keep hearing this as well. First thing for us with Xbox
   One S is making sure we have a great entry-level price, because price
   is critical. It's $299, smaller design, great-looking design, it plays
   all your Xbox One games, your accessories work. If you think about the
   really critical things it has to go do, we needed to tick all those
   boxes. That was the product.

   Then we looked at what was happening, and we said there were some
   opportunities for us to do a little more. With upgrading the HDMI
   technology in the box, we're able to support 4K video streaming. So we
   said, okay, if we're going to support 4K video streaming, let's also
   put a UHD Blu-ray drive in there for 4K disc, so you can watch video in
   4K. Just because where we were in technology, we saw that and we said,
   okay, let's make that possible.

   From a design standpoint, it was designed to play Xbox One games
   exactly the same way your existing Xbox One does.

   But I hear there is a small processing boost.
   2 The Xbox One S.

   Phil Spencer: The one definitive feature that's different is HDR. So,
   with the increased HDMI capability, it has the ability to support High
   Dynamic Range. I will say - and I've been asked about this - and I'm
   not trying to dodge the question, you should expect it to play your
   games the same way an Xbox One does. We did not design this to play
   Xbox One games better than the original Xbox One console.

   We've gone through - even on the existing hardware - multiple hardware
   iterations on the inside. There will be certain decisions that are made
   either for cost reasons or other supply chain reasons that can result
   in slightly different performance, whether it's disc drive
   throughput... everything's not always pegged at exactly the same
   number, but honestly, do not buy this box if you think you're buying it
   to play your Xbox One games better, because it was not designed to go
   do that. It was designed to play your Xbox One games exactly the way
   your Xbox One does.

   I don't want anybody to think this is somehow a performance boost for
   Xbox One games. That's why we said HDR on-screen, and that's what we
   want to be explicit about. Outside of that, you should expect your Xbox
   One games to run exactly the same.

   You announced the Xbox One S. And then you closed the show with
   Scorpio. Why would I buy the Xbox One S knowing the Scorpio is coming?
   What possible reason would I have given a much more powerful Xbox is
   coming down the line?

   Phil Spencer: What TV do you have?

   A standard 1080p TV.

   Phil Spencer: Then you should buy this box, because Scorpio is not
   going to do anything for you. Scorpio is designed as a 4K console, and
   if you don't have a 4K TV, the benefit we've designed for, you're not
   going to see. Clearly, you can buy Scorpio, and if and when you decide
   you want to buy a 4K television to take advantage of the increased
   performance, obviously the console will be ready for you.

   But I would say, price point is important, compatibility is critically
   important. We looked at 4K, talked to creators, you saw Todd Howard in
   our video, Patrick Soderlund from EA in our video, talked to creators
   about the work they were doing on PC in order to hit a true 4K gaming
   experience, and six teraflops is what we needed to go hit, so we
   designed for that.

   For us in the industry, it's easy to think that most power is always
   the thing that wins. If you look at last gen, what won? The Wii won.
   The Wii sold more than we did on Xbox 360 and the PS3, and it wasn't
   the most powerful console out there. Price is critically important. Wii
   was a good price and it had a great experience.

   But I'll say, having an Xbox One at $299 is going to be really
   important for us. It's the only $299 console on the market right now,
   and it supports 4K video with the S, that's going to be a really good
   selling feature for us, and we've got our biggest lineup of games
   coming this year in 2016.

   So, Scorpio is for the person who's got a 4K television, who's really
   focused on 4K gaming. It's going to be a premium price over what we're
   selling this one for, and both of them will exist in the market at the
   same time. Scorpio is for your 4K gamer. And that's what we designed it
   for.

   I saw Aaron Greenberg tweeted to say there will be no Scorpio
   exclusives. Is that right?

   Phil Spencer: That's right. When you're buying a console game from us,
   you know that console game will run on your original Xbox. No-one gets
   left behind. We said that on stage. Your Xbox One S and Scorpio. That's
   an important design point for us. They're all part of the same family.
   And we want to make sure just like when you're buying your music today,
   you don't worry about upgrading to a new phone that somehow won't play
   your old songs or your new songs. We think about your Xbox One
   collection of games that will move with you between those different
   consoles.

   In fact, somebody today will have an Xbox One, and when Scorpio comes
   out they will buy Scorpio and they will put Xbox One in a different
   room, and we're obviously going to make sure that as they move between
   rooms that they've got access to the same games.

   The Scorpio games are obviously designed to take advantage of six
   teraflops and 4K. Your Xbox One, you were playing those today. You know
   what those look like and feel like. But there won't be Scorpio
   exclusive console games. Absolutely not.

   But the specs you have released suggest the Scorpio is a monster,
   beyond what we understand of the PlayStation 4 Neo. Won't developers be
   so excited by the prospect, that they'll want to develop for the specs,
   and if so we're in a situation where they're thinking about, well, I
   have to actually make this work on Xbox One as well, and that's perhaps
   an issue for them?

   Phil Spencer: Our biggest games out there ship on PC today, and the PC
   has this space of, right, you look at the big PC games that are coming
   out, they're going to support 4K, some of them will support 6K and
   crazy resolutions on PC and unlock framerates. What a developer's
   looking for is a real sweet spot of install base and users. We've got
   tens of millions of people who have Xbox Ones. Developers are gonna see
   that and, frankly, as the platform holder we're going to make sure
   games come out and support Xbox One.

   They're already building 4K PC games, which is why we went out and
   talked to developers explicitly about what it takes to build a 4K PC
   game, to make sure Scorpio was a spec that they could look at what
   they're doing on PC and say, okay, I understand exactly how I'm going
   to make the Scorpio version of my game because I'm doing it on PC.

   We just shipped Forza Motorsport Apex on Windows. We shipped that at 4K
   and we looked at that. We talked to Todd Howard about Fallout and the
   work he's doing on Fallout VR and said, what is the spec we need to
   have in Scorpio to make sure we can support 4K?

   So developers today are supporting multiple design points already.
   That's why we picked 4K and not something kind of weird in the middle.
   We could have done a new update this year. We actually looked at it. We
   went all the way to, we had the spec in front of us, should we ship
   something that's less than Scorpio this year, but in truth you can't do
   a true 4K console this year. And I just didn't think anything between
   what is effectively a 1080p console and the 4K console, like, from a
   consumer television standpoint there's nothing in the middle. So let's
   go focus on 4K and next year was the right year to do that.

   Given the power of the Scorpio, should it be considered a refresh of
   the Xbox One, or are we looking at, actually, the next-generation of
   what you are doing in terms of console? Is that actually the fair
   assessment of it?

   Phil Spencer: That fact that when you buy an Xbox One and start
   creating your game library and when you buy Scorpio those games and
   accessories and everything are going to run, make it feel like part of
   the Xbox One family to me. That's why we communicate it that way. That
   was also part of the design point of the box.

   Last year we announced backward compatibility, which at the time I
   think people looked at as, hey, can you get your Xbox 360 customers to
   buy an Xbox One? And yes, that's an important part of it. But really
   from a soul standpoint, we're thinking about when you buy your games
   from us, we want you to be able to play those games on the hardware we
   sell to you.

   That's why we say beyond generations. The idea, is this part of the
   previous generation or the next generation gets a little blurry. For
   you and I, we usually think about generations in terms of what games
   will it play? This thing will play Ryse: Son of Rome, a launch game for
   your Xbox One. And we'll have launch Scorpio games as well that are
   playable on an Xbox One, Xbox One S and Scorpio and look great on all
   three of them.

   So the idea of a generation is a little difficult to stretch on to
   this. That's why I focus on 4K and say this is really a six teraflop
   console built to support 4K and the power of high fidelity VR.

   You haven't mentioned the RAM.

   Phil Spencer: Yeah, I know.

   What's the RAM?

   Phil Spencer: Kareem (Choudhry, Xbox head engineer) went through some
   of the specs in the video that's probably all we're gonna talk about.

   Some eagle-eyed people reckon they've worked it out based on a snapshot
   of the motherboard.

   Phil Spencer: They've done a good job. We've seen that. We knew that
   would happen.

   Balance in the design of the system is really important. So when you
   think about the CPU and the GPU that are on the SOC, the optical disc
   drive and the speed of that, which we haven't talked about too much,
   but I'll just say that, the speed of RAM, all of these things when
   you're designing the system, making sure they're all in balance, so one
   piece doesn't get overpowered relative to the other, or you've got a
   lot of GPU but you're not able to feed all of the assets to it out of
   the RAM fast enough, all of those things were critical for us when
   thinking about the design.

   All of this is why we picked the design point we did of 4K and the date
   we did. Like I said, we looked at other designs that might be coming
   earlier, and we don't think they really delivered on a full point.
   Kareem's line was this is a monster. You said the same thing. It's
   really the totality of the design. And we'll definitely be talking more
   about it as we go forward. But I'm really proud of the design.

   With Scorpio you're introducing the idea of people playing online
   together and against each other in competitive multiplayer, one person
   perhaps on Scorpio and one on Xbox One. If the Scorpio enables such
   things as better framerate, won't that give the Scorpio user a
   competitive advantage in certain games?

   Phil Spencer: Obviously the game designers of our games have to think
   about framerate and field of view when they're designing competitive
   situations. We have this scenario with cross-play today, people playing
   games on PC and console at the same time.

   On a console to console experience, when we designed Scorpio and we
   said 4K console, we looked at games that are running at, let's say
   1080p 60 on an Xbox One, and said we want that same game to be able to
   run at 4K 60 on a Scorpio. We looked at the design of the games we had
   on Xbox One today and said, if we increase the resolution and maintain
   the framerate we have, could we hit that?
   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   It's not for the faint-hearted.

   I think framerate's more interesting than resolution in terms of
   competitive gaming, and we wanted to make sure teams were able to build
   the 4K version of their game at the same framerate they can hit, at
   whatever resolution: 900 or 1K or even 720 that they're hitting on this
   box. So, we thought specifically about that situation and talked to
   developers about it.

   If you're together in a co-op situation it's probably less interesting.
   But with people playing together, we wanted to make sure you could
   build the same framerate at a higher resolution between the two
   consoles, and that was critical to us in the RAM design and everything
   else we did.

   The team spent a lot of time thinking through the scenarios you're
   thinking through. We want to make sure the completeness of the
   ecosystem is there. It's why we announced it when we did. Like, who
   announces a console that early? Like, I must be the worst leader in the
   world to go do that of a console. But I know the discussions with the
   creators and the customers and the fans about what we're doing, it's
   better to have that discussion out in the open instead of us trying to
   keep things away from you so you don't find secret codenames and stuff.
   Now we can just have the open and honest conversation about what
   different teams are doing, and customers get to make the right
   decision, and creators can plan for when Scorpio comes so they make the
   best decision.

   I've probably done 20 disclosures with third-parties over the last few
   months as we locked on our plan to communicate it and everything we're
   doing. Actually more than that - we've been doing this for quite a
   while. They've been both giving us great feedback, very supportive and
   constructive in this process, and I want to continue to do that. And,
   you know, as we start talking to more and more people externally, the
   chances of leaks just go up, so why not just be transparent about what
   our plans are and our visions are?

   Foundry has done a separate analysis of Xbox One Project Scorpio.

Nintendo New 2DS XL review

Cut back in the right places, improved in others.

   By Thomas Morgan. 24/06/2017

   Six years since the 3DS first launched, Nintendo's New 2DS XL lets the
   handheld go out on a high. Forget the standard 2DS - a heavily stripped
   back version of the console released at a budget price - the 2DS XL is
   a very different beast. It includes almost all the features of the New
   3DS XL, including its extra processing power and 256MB of RAM. You get
   the C-stick controls and ZL/ZR shoulder buttons as well, plus Amiibo
   NFC support. But as the name of the machine suggests, the obvious
   change is the complete removal of the auto-stereoscopic 3D display, and
   the head-tracking technology.

   These cutbacks translate to a lower £130 price-tag, shaving a good
   £30-40 off the New 3DS XL, and making it less than half the price of a
   Nintendo Switch. For anyone itching to check out a huge catalogue of
   3DS and DS games, and just aren't fussed about 3D, there's a lot to
   like - fundamentally, this is a well-built piece of kit. However, there
   are a couple of nitpicks too.

   Article Continues Below
   Loading... hold tight!

   Nintendo could have stuck with its existing New 3DS XL design, but
   instead, the platform holder has made a number of changes. The New 2DS
   XL's processing power remains the same, but the exterior casing has
   been revamped. It's simplistic - as befits its price-point - again
   using mostly matte plastics for the body, and a redesigned hinge that
   lets both screens lay out evenly when snapped to the last position. The
   only criticism is that there's still a wobble to that top screen when
   moving around, with the hinge not quite as solid as it should have been
   - but that's a long-running problem with Nintendo's clamshell designs.

   Otherwise, it's as robust a design as you'd expect from the 3DS line.
   And aesthetically, there's some nice touches too. A stylish striped
   texture runs across on top, wrapped around by a glossy coloured edge,
   turquoise in the case of our review unit. A drawback here is that
   there's no option for custom faceplates, supposing you don't like the
   default style.

   In terms of inputs and connections, the New 2DS XL retains all the
   features of its more expensive sibling. It feels much the same. You get
   the same clicky feedback of the d-pad and face buttons, and the unique
   circle pad makes a return as-is. In terms of inputs, everything's moved
   to the bottom edge here as well.

   Article Continues Below
   Loading... hold tight!

   For once, the game cartridge slot now has a physical, plastic cover at
   the bottom that neighbours the microSD slot, which has a 4GB card
   already installed. Next, the stylus sits next to a 3.5mm headphone
   port, while a power button protrudes from the far right, alongside LEDs
   for power, charging and WiFi. Beyond that, the volume slider sits on
   the left flank of the unit, though of course, the 3D slider - which
   usually mirrors that - is missing on the right.

   There's one very pleasant surprise with the New 2DS XL; it has a
   genuine advantage in terms of size and weight. Height-wise, it's about
   a centimetre smaller than the New 3DS XL, thanks to a new folding
   design that relocates the camera to the hinge, saving some room. It's
   not a big deal, but more impressive is the substantial weight
   reduction, down to 260g compared to its sibling's 329g, and the 398g of
   a Switch with Joycons attached. However, a snag to the redesign
   concerns the speakers: these move from either side of the top screen to
   the bottom edge, the side-effect being the openings can at times get
   muffled by your palms.

   Going into this review, we were concerned that in order to bring the
   price-point down, Nintendo might have cut corners on the displays -
   beyond removing the 3D functionality. Thankfully, the screen is very
   close in quality to the New 3DS XL model; you get an effective 400x240
   resolution up top, and 320x240 on the lower resistive touch screen.

   The top screen stacks up nicely against other 3DS products: it's
   colourful and punchy. But of course, we've since been spoilt by the
   Switch's six-inch IPS panel, meaning there's a sense of regression
   going back to the 2DS XL. For one, viewing angles aren't great, there's
   ghosting on grey-to-grey transitions, and it just lacks the sheer
   brightness of Switch's display.

   In fact it looks positively dull if you take it outside, even on max
   brightness. For perspective, we measured a peak brightness level of 147
   nits on the 2DS XL, compared to 368 nits on Switch. It makes a big
   difference, but as long as you're not out in blazing sunlight, there's
   still plenty of contrast and punch to the screen in most gaming
   conditions. Our review unit seems to have a TN panel, but besides
   restrictive viewing angles, it's still a very strong-looking display.

   Thankfully, there are no perceptible cutbacks to battery life, either.
   The official line from Nintendo is that the New 2DS XL gets a similar
   play-time to regular 3DS models; a range of three to five and half
   hours. We ramped up the brightness level to the maximum, left WiFi
   enabled and set volume to 75 per cent. Booting up Mario Kart 7, we
   clocked in three hours and 50 minutes of continuous play of the game
   before the power cut out. It's maybe a shame that stripping the extras
   from a 3DS doesn't qualify us for more battery life. As a stress-test
   though, the turnout is on par, or very slightly higher than the other
   models.

   Nintendo's come a long way in refining its 3DS across the last six
   years. The fact is that there's now several ways to tap into its large
   games catalogue, and the New 2DS XL stands as one of the best options.
   Price is a factor of course, and ideally we'd always want everything in
   one package, with no compromise - but if you've got zero interest in
   ever using stereoscopic 3D, the argument for checking out the 2DS XL is
   much easier. There are even some unique advantages going this route. If
   you can get on with its design, you have all the functionality of a
   more expensive handheld, but in a noticeably lighter profile.
   Everything is thankfully included in the box too, from the charger to
   the 4GB SD card, so there's no skimping there, as we've seen in past.

   Overall then, Nintendo's New 2DS XL offers a significant upgrade over
   the entry level 2DS in terms of build quality, processing power and
   form-factor - but with the bargain basement model available for just
   £75 these days, an extra £55 on top is a significantly higher level of
   investment. It sits as a midway point between 2DS and 3DS XL, in terms
   of both pricing and spec. From our perspective, we'd still opt for the
   New 3DS XL as the unit of choice - the front-facing speakers are
   preferable, and from time to time, it's interesting to see how titles
   use its 3D features. But there's no real deal-breaker for the New 2DS
   XL. As a way to complement the more expensive Switch, this is a
   respectable way to enjoy the 3DS' massive library of excellent
   software.

   of both pricing and spec. From our perspective, we'd still opt for the
   New 3DS XL as the unit of choice - the front-facing speakers are
   preferable, and from time to time, it's interesting to see how titles
   use its 3D features. But there's no real deal-breaker for the New 2DS
   XL. As a way to complement the more expensive Switch, this is a
   respectable way to enjoy the 3DS' massive library of excellent
   software.

Xbox boss Phil Spencer: the big interview

   "Scorpio is designed as a 4K console…"
   Interview by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor
   Updated on 15 June 2016

   Microsoft's E3 media briefing was strong, I thought, although its
   impact was dulled by a pretty spectacular set of leaks that not only
   revealed the existence of the Xbox One S and Scorpio ahead of time, but
   the running order of the show.

   On stage, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was determined to tell the whole
   story, and he did well, announcing Xbox Play Anywhere, which should
   help boost the potential player base of all those "Xbox One and Windows
   10 exclusive" games we heard about this week.

   And yet, the announcement of the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio left
   plenty of questions unanswered. Perhaps chief among them is this: with
   Project Scorpio looming over the horizon, who in their right mind will
   now buy the Xbox One S?

   We know Project Scorpio offers an impressive six teraflops of power,
   but one crucial aspect of its innards remains shrouded in mystery: the
   RAM.

   And surely with those beefy specs the Scorpio, or whatever it ends up
   being called, signals the arrival of the next-generation of consoles,
   not some mid-generational refresh, as we perhaps expect of the rival
   PlayStation 4 Neo. And if it does, won't developers want to make the
   most of all that power, leaving poor old Xbox One owners behind?

   Not so, Phil Spencer told me in an interview at E3 this week. Here,
   Spencer explains who, exactly, Project Scorpio is for, why Xbox One S
   is a console people should be interested in, and about those leaks...
   1 Phil Spencer on stage during Microsofts E3 2016 media briefing.

   I enjoyed your conference and I thought it was strong...

   Phil Spencer: Thank you. But... here it comes...

   The edge was taken of some announcements, particularly Scorpio, by the
   huge number of leaks you suffered. Was that something you felt as the
   conference took place, or detected in your analysis of the reaction?

   Phil Spencer: I thought the excitement in the arena was high. We've got
   the fans there. We do this fan event on Saturday night where we bring
   people out so we can give them tickets to the show and get them into
   E3. Last year we had a few hundred people show up. This year we had 800
   people show up on Saturday. So even with the leaks, we looked at our
   numbers online in terms of how many people watched and they were higher
   than ever. So I think there was a lot of excitement and anticipation.

   In some ways you guys in your secret ways find the leaks and are able
   to publish those things, it doesn't really become real until it's
   validated because we stood on stage and said something. All that said,
   honestly, I like us to be able to control our message and say it in
   complete.

   The leaks are a bummer. The things that are more of a bummer are the
   leaks that come out that are inaccurate, or part of a story, because
   then, without being able to tell the whole story, there could be
   certain parts of the plan - you could laugh then and say won't you leak
   everything like we did this time, it's not an issue - but you know what
   I mean. If somebody finds a certain part of it and it doesn't all tie
   together, that's why I think the opportunity to say something on stage.
   We need that.

   I felt the energy in the centre was great. Viewership was really high.
   But honestly, we gotta find a way to control more of the leaks, yeah.

   I stood on stage in front of the 4000 people at Xbox in February and
   detailed Scorpio and said here's what it was. There are people inside
   the company who would say, that's crazy. Of course it's going to leak.
   But I also, a couple months before we announced we were going to ship
   an Xbox One without Kinect in it, did the same thing and everybody
   said, if you do that everybody will stop buying now, you can't do this,
   it's gonna leak.

   The work that happens month after month the team does is driven by
   thousands of people who are engaged and believe in the plan, and I
   don't know how to be a leader for that organisation if I can't
   communicate with them openly on what's happening. I don't think our
   team leaked, but doing things like that, if things leak, I will take
   the leak over not being able to be open and transparent with the team
   that's actually going to do the work, because their hearts and minds
   are infinitely more important to our long-term success than a couple
   weeks or days before our announcement, a leak going out.

   So it's always this balance. I choose to try to be as open and
   transparent as we can be when we've made our decisions about what we're
   going to do.

   You announced Xbox One S. I hear there's extra processing power...

   Phil Spencer: I keep hearing this as well. First thing for us with Xbox
   One S is making sure we have a great entry-level price, because price
   is critical. It's $299, smaller design, great-looking design, it plays
   all your Xbox One games, your accessories work. If you think about the
   really critical things it has to go do, we needed to tick all those
   boxes. That was the product.

   Then we looked at what was happening, and we said there were some
   opportunities for us to do a little more. With upgrading the HDMI
   technology in the box, we're able to support 4K video streaming. So we
   said, okay, if we're going to support 4K video streaming, let's also
   put a UHD Blu-ray drive in there for 4K disc, so you can watch video in
   4K. Just because where we were in technology, we saw that and we said,
   okay, let's make that possible.

   From a design standpoint, it was designed to play Xbox One games
   exactly the same way your existing Xbox One does.

   But I hear there is a small processing boost.
   2 The Xbox One S.

   Phil Spencer: The one definitive feature that's different is HDR. So,
   with the increased HDMI capability, it has the ability to support High
   Dynamic Range. I will say - and I've been asked about this - and I'm
   not trying to dodge the question, you should expect it to play your
   games the same way an Xbox One does. We did not design this to play
   Xbox One games better than the original Xbox One console.

   We've gone through - even on the existing hardware - multiple hardware
   iterations on the inside. There will be certain decisions that are made
   either for cost reasons or other supply chain reasons that can result
   in slightly different performance, whether it's disc drive
   throughput... everything's not always pegged at exactly the same
   number, but honestly, do not buy this box if you think you're buying it
   to play your Xbox One games better, because it was not designed to go
   do that. It was designed to play your Xbox One games exactly the way
   your Xbox One does.

   I don't want anybody to think this is somehow a performance boost for
   Xbox One games. That's why we said HDR on-screen, and that's what we
   want to be explicit about. Outside of that, you should expect your Xbox
   One games to run exactly the same.

   You announced the Xbox One S. And then you closed the show with
   Scorpio. Why would I buy the Xbox One S knowing the Scorpio is coming?
   What possible reason would I have given a much more powerful Xbox is
   coming down the line?

   Phil Spencer: What TV do you have?

   A standard 1080p TV.

   Phil Spencer: Then you should buy this box, because Scorpio is not
   going to do anything for you. Scorpio is designed as a 4K console, and
   if you don't have a 4K TV, the benefit we've designed for, you're not
   going to see. Clearly, you can buy Scorpio, and if and when you decide
   you want to buy a 4K television to take advantage of the increased
   performance, obviously the console will be ready for you.

   But I would say, price point is important, compatibility is critically
   important. We looked at 4K, talked to creators, you saw Todd Howard in
   our video, Patrick Soderlund from EA in our video, talked to creators
   about the work they were doing on PC in order to hit a true 4K gaming
   experience, and six teraflops is what we needed to go hit, so we
   designed for that.

   For us in the industry, it's easy to think that most power is always
   the thing that wins. If you look at last gen, what won? The Wii won.
   The Wii sold more than we did on Xbox 360 and the PS3, and it wasn't
   the most powerful console out there. Price is critically important. Wii
   was a good price and it had a great experience.

   But I'll say, having an Xbox One at $299 is going to be really
   important for us. It's the only $299 console on the market right now,
   and it supports 4K video with the S, that's going to be a really good
   selling feature for us, and we've got our biggest lineup of games
   coming this year in 2016.

   So, Scorpio is for the person who's got a 4K television, who's really
   focused on 4K gaming. It's going to be a premium price over what we're
   selling this one for, and both of them will exist in the market at the
   same time. Scorpio is for your 4K gamer. And that's what we designed it
   for.

   I saw Aaron Greenberg tweeted to say there will be no Scorpio
   exclusives. Is that right?

   Phil Spencer: That's right. When you're buying a console game from us,
   you know that console game will run on your original Xbox. No-one gets
   left behind. We said that on stage. Your Xbox One S and Scorpio. That's
   an important design point for us. They're all part of the same family.
   And we want to make sure just like when you're buying your music today,
   you don't worry about upgrading to a new phone that somehow won't play
   your old songs or your new songs. We think about your Xbox One
   collection of games that will move with you between those different
   consoles.

   In fact, somebody today will have an Xbox One, and when Scorpio comes
   out they will buy Scorpio and they will put Xbox One in a different
   room, and we're obviously going to make sure that as they move between
   rooms that they've got access to the same games.

   The Scorpio games are obviously designed to take advantage of six
   teraflops and 4K. Your Xbox One, you were playing those today. You know
   what those look like and feel like. But there won't be Scorpio
   exclusive console games. Absolutely not.

   But the specs you have released suggest the Scorpio is a monster,
   beyond what we understand of the PlayStation 4 Neo. Won't developers be
   so excited by the prospect, that they'll want to develop for the specs,
   and if so we're in a situation where they're thinking about, well, I
   have to actually make this work on Xbox One as well, and that's perhaps
   an issue for them?

   Phil Spencer: Our biggest games out there ship on PC today, and the PC
   has this space of, right, you look at the big PC games that are coming
   out, they're going to support 4K, some of them will support 6K and
   crazy resolutions on PC and unlock framerates. What a developer's
   looking for is a real sweet spot of install base and users. We've got
   tens of millions of people who have Xbox Ones. Developers are gonna see
   that and, frankly, as the platform holder we're going to make sure
   games come out and support Xbox One.

   They're already building 4K PC games, which is why we went out and
   talked to developers explicitly about what it takes to build a 4K PC
   game, to make sure Scorpio was a spec that they could look at what
   they're doing on PC and say, okay, I understand exactly how I'm going
   to make the Scorpio version of my game because I'm doing it on PC.

   We just shipped Forza Motorsport Apex on Windows. We shipped that at 4K
   and we looked at that. We talked to Todd Howard about Fallout and the
   work he's doing on Fallout VR and said, what is the spec we need to
   have in Scorpio to make sure we can support 4K?

   So developers today are supporting multiple design points already.
   That's why we picked 4K and not something kind of weird in the middle.
   We could have done a new update this year. We actually looked at it. We
   went all the way to, we had the spec in front of us, should we ship
   something that's less than Scorpio this year, but in truth you can't do
   a true 4K console this year. And I just didn't think anything between
   what is effectively a 1080p console and the 4K console, like, from a
   consumer television standpoint there's nothing in the middle. So let's
   go focus on 4K and next year was the right year to do that.

   Given the power of the Scorpio, should it be considered a refresh of
   the Xbox One, or are we looking at, actually, the next-generation of
   what you are doing in terms of console? Is that actually the fair
   assessment of it?

   Phil Spencer: That fact that when you buy an Xbox One and start
   creating your game library and when you buy Scorpio those games and
   accessories and everything are going to run, make it feel like part of
   the Xbox One family to me. That's why we communicate it that way. That
   was also part of the design point of the box.

   Last year we announced backward compatibility, which at the time I
   think people looked at as, hey, can you get your Xbox 360 customers to
   buy an Xbox One? And yes, that's an important part of it. But really
   from a soul standpoint, we're thinking about when you buy your games
   from us, we want you to be able to play those games on the hardware we
   sell to you.

   That's why we say beyond generations. The idea, is this part of the
   previous generation or the next generation gets a little blurry. For
   you and I, we usually think about generations in terms of what games
   will it play? This thing will play Ryse: Son of Rome, a launch game for
   your Xbox One. And we'll have launch Scorpio games as well that are
   playable on an Xbox One, Xbox One S and Scorpio and look great on all
   three of them.

   So the idea of a generation is a little difficult to stretch on to
   this. That's why I focus on 4K and say this is really a six teraflop
   console built to support 4K and the power of high fidelity VR.

   You haven't mentioned the RAM.

   Phil Spencer: Yeah, I know.

   What's the RAM?

   Phil Spencer: Kareem (Choudhry, Xbox head engineer) went through some
   of the specs in the video that's probably all we're gonna talk about.

   Some eagle-eyed people reckon they've worked it out based on a snapshot
   of the motherboard.

   Phil Spencer: They've done a good job. We've seen that. We knew that
   would happen.

   Balance in the design of the system is really important. So when you
   think about the CPU and the GPU that are on the SOC, the optical disc
   drive and the speed of that, which we haven't talked about too much,
   but I'll just say that, the speed of RAM, all of these things when
   you're designing the system, making sure they're all in balance, so one
   piece doesn't get overpowered relative to the other, or you've got a
   lot of GPU but you're not able to feed all of the assets to it out of
   the RAM fast enough, all of those things were critical for us when
   thinking about the design.

   All of this is why we picked the design point we did of 4K and the date
   we did. Like I said, we looked at other designs that might be coming
   earlier, and we don't think they really delivered on a full point.
   Kareem's line was this is a monster. You said the same thing. It's
   really the totality of the design. And we'll definitely be talking more
   about it as we go forward. But I'm really proud of the design.

   With Scorpio you're introducing the idea of people playing online
   together and against each other in competitive multiplayer, one person
   perhaps on Scorpio and one on Xbox One. If the Scorpio enables such
   things as better framerate, won't that give the Scorpio user a
   competitive advantage in certain games?

   Phil Spencer: Obviously the game designers of our games have to think
   about framerate and field of view when they're designing competitive
   situations. We have this scenario with cross-play today, people playing
   games on PC and console at the same time.

   On a console to console experience, when we designed Scorpio and we
   said 4K console, we looked at games that are running at, let's say
   1080p 60 on an Xbox One, and said we want that same game to be able to
   run at 4K 60 on a Scorpio. We looked at the design of the games we had
   on Xbox One today and said, if we increase the resolution and maintain
   the framerate we have, could we hit that?
   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   There is a Witcher School and I've been

   It's not for the faint-hearted.

   I think framerate's more interesting than resolution in terms of
   competitive gaming, and we wanted to make sure teams were able to build
   the 4K version of their game at the same framerate they can hit, at
   whatever resolution: 900 or 1K or even 720 that they're hitting on this
   box. So, we thought specifically about that situation and talked to
   developers about it.

   If you're together in a co-op situation it's probably less interesting.
   But with people playing together, we wanted to make sure you could
   build the same framerate at a higher resolution between the two
   consoles, and that was critical to us in the RAM design and everything
   else we did.

   The team spent a lot of time thinking through the scenarios you're
   thinking through. We want to make sure the completeness of the
   ecosystem is there. It's why we announced it when we did. Like, who
   announces a console that early? Like, I must be the worst leader in the
   world to go do that of a console. But I know the discussions with the
   creators and the customers and the fans about what we're doing, it's
   better to have that discussion out in the open instead of us trying to
   keep things away from you so you don't find secret codenames and stuff.
   Now we can just have the open and honest conversation about what
   different teams are doing, and customers get to make the right
   decision, and creators can plan for when Scorpio comes so they make the
   best decision.

   I've probably done 20 disclosures with third-parties over the last few
   months as we locked on our plan to communicate it and everything we're
   doing. Actually more than that - we've been doing this for quite a
   while. They've been both giving us great feedback, very supportive and
   constructive in this process, and I want to continue to do that. And,
   you know, as we start talking to more and more people externally, the
   chances of leaks just go up, so why not just be transparent about what
   our plans are and our visions are?

   Foundry has done a separate analysis of Xbox One Project Scorpio.

Nintendo New 2DS XL review

Cut back in the right places, improved in others.

   By Thomas Morgan. 24/06/2017

   Six years since the 3DS first launched, Nintendo's New 2DS XL lets the
   handheld go out on a high. Forget the standard 2DS - a heavily stripped
   back version of the console released at a budget price - the 2DS XL is
   a very different beast. It includes almost all the features of the New
   3DS XL, including its extra processing power and 256MB of RAM. You get
   the C-stick controls and ZL/ZR shoulder buttons as well, plus Amiibo
   NFC support. But as the name of the machine suggests, the obvious
   change is the complete removal of the auto-stereoscopic 3D display, and
   the head-tracking technology.

   These cutbacks translate to a lower £130 price-tag, shaving a good
   £30-40 off the New 3DS XL, and making it less than half the price of a
   Nintendo Switch. For anyone itching to check out a huge catalogue of
   3DS and DS games, and just aren't fussed about 3D, there's a lot to
   like - fundamentally, this is a well-built piece of kit. However, there
   are a couple of nitpicks too.

   Article Continues Below
   Loading... hold tight!

   Nintendo could have stuck with its existing New 3DS XL design, but
   instead, the platform holder has made a number of changes. The New 2DS
   XL's processing power remains the same, but the exterior casing has
   been revamped. It's simplistic - as befits its price-point - again
   using mostly matte plastics for the body, and a redesigned hinge that
   lets both screens lay out evenly when snapped to the last position. The
   only criticism is that there's still a wobble to that top screen when
   moving around, with the hinge not quite as solid as it should have been
   - but that's a long-running problem with Nintendo's clamshell designs.

   Otherwise, it's as robust a design as you'd expect from the 3DS line.
   And aesthetically, there's some nice touches too. A stylish striped
   texture runs across on top, wrapped around by a glossy coloured edge,
   turquoise in the case of our review unit. A drawback here is that
   there's no option for custom faceplates, supposing you don't like the
   default style.

   In terms of inputs and connections, the New 2DS XL retains all the
   features of its more expensive sibling. It feels much the same. You get
   the same clicky feedback of the d-pad and face buttons, and the unique
   circle pad makes a return as-is. In terms of inputs, everything's moved
   to the bottom edge here as well.

   Article Continues Below
   Loading... hold tight!

   For once, the game cartridge slot now has a physical, plastic cover at
   the bottom that neighbours the microSD slot, which has a 4GB card
   already installed. Next, the stylus sits next to a 3.5mm headphone
   port, while a power button protrudes from the far right, alongside LEDs
   for power, charging and WiFi. Beyond that, the volume slider sits on
   the left flank of the unit, though of course, the 3D slider - which
   usually mirrors that - is missing on the right.

   There's one very pleasant surprise with the New 2DS XL; it has a
   genuine advantage in terms of size and weight. Height-wise, it's about
   a centimetre smaller than the New 3DS XL, thanks to a new folding
   design that relocates the camera to the hinge, saving some room. It's
   not a big deal, but more impressive is the substantial weight
   reduction, down to 260g compared to its sibling's 329g, and the 398g of
   a Switch with Joycons attached. However, a snag to the redesign
   concerns the speakers: these move from either side of the top screen to
   the bottom edge, the side-effect being the openings can at times get
   muffled by your palms.

   Going into this review, we were concerned that in order to bring the
   price-point down, Nintendo might have cut corners on the displays -
   beyond removing the 3D functionality. Thankfully, the screen is very
   close in quality to the New 3DS XL model; you get an effective 400x240
   resolution up top, and 320x240 on the lower resistive touch screen.

   The top screen stacks up nicely against other 3DS products: it's
   colourful and punchy. But of course, we've since been spoilt by the
   Switch's six-inch IPS panel, meaning there's a sense of regression
   going back to the 2DS XL. For one, viewing angles aren't great, there's
   ghosting on grey-to-grey transitions, and it just lacks the sheer
   brightness of Switch's display.

   In fact it looks positively dull if you take it outside, even on max
   brightness. For perspective, we measured a peak brightness level of 147
   nits on the 2DS XL, compared to 368 nits on Switch. It makes a big
   difference, but as long as you're not out in blazing sunlight, there's
   still plenty of contrast and punch to the screen in most gaming
   conditions. Our review unit seems to have a TN panel, but besides
   restrictive viewing angles, it's still a very strong-looking display.

   Thankfully, there are no perceptible cutbacks to battery life, either.
   The official line from Nintendo is that the New 2DS XL gets a similar
   play-time to regular 3DS models; a range of three to five and half
   hours. We ramped up the brightness level to the maximum, left WiFi
   enabled and set volume to 75 per cent. Booting up Mario Kart 7, we
   clocked in three hours and 50 minutes of continuous play of the game
   before the power cut out. It's maybe a shame that stripping the extras
   from a 3DS doesn't qualify us for more battery life. As a stress-test
   though, the turnout is on par, or very slightly higher than the other
   models.

   Nintendo's come a long way in refining its 3DS across the last six
   years. The fact is that there's now several ways to tap into its large
   games catalogue, and the New 2DS XL stands as one of the best options.
   Price is a factor of course, and ideally we'd always want everything in
   one package, with no compromise - but if you've got zero interest in
   ever using stereoscopic 3D, the argument for checking out the 2DS XL is
   much easier. There are even some unique advantages going this route. If
   you can get on with its design, you have all the functionality of a
   more expensive handheld, but in a noticeably lighter profile.
   Everything is thankfully included in the box too, from the charger to
   the 4GB SD card, so there's no skimping there, as we've seen in past.

   Overall then, Nintendo's New 2DS XL offers a significant upgrade over
   the entry level 2DS in terms of build quality, processing power and
   form-factor - but with the bargain basement model available for just
   £75 these days, an extra £55 on top is a significantly higher level of
   investment. It sits as a midway point between 2DS and 3DS XL, in terms
   of both pricing and spec. From our perspective, we'd still opt for the
   New 3DS XL as the unit of choice - the front-facing speakers are
   preferable, and from time to time, it's interesting to see how titles
   use its 3D features. But there's no real deal-breaker for the New 2DS
   XL. As a way to complement the more expensive Switch, this is a
   respectable way to enjoy the 3DS' massive library of excellent
   software.
