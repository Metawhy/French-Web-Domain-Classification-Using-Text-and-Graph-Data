   Security Status

   In Softonic we scan all the files hosted on our platform to assess and
   avoid any potential harm for your device. Our team performs checks each
   time a new file is uploaded and periodically reviews files to confirm
   or update their status. This comprehensive process allows us to set a
   status for any downloadable file as follows:
     * Clean
       It’s extremely likely that this software program is clean.
       What does this mean?
       We have scanned the file and URLs associated with this software
       program in more than 50 of the world's leading antivirus services;
       no possible threat has been detected.
     * Warning
       This software program is potentially malicious or may contain
       unwanted bundled software.
       Why is the software program still available?
       Based on our scan system, we have determined that these flags are
       possibly false positives.
       What is a false positive?
       It means a benign program is wrongfully flagged as malicious due to
       an overly broad detection signature or algorithm used in an
       antivirus program.
     * Blocked
       It’s highly probable this software program is malicious or contains
       unwanted bundled software.
       Why is this software program no longer available in our Catalog?
       Based on our scan system, we have determined that these flags are
       likely to be real positives.

   We’d like to highlight that from time to time, we may miss a
   potentially malicious software program. To continue promising you a
   malware-free catalog of programs and apps, our team has integrated a
   Report Software feature in every catalog page that loops your feedback
   back to us.

   Flag any particular issues you may encounter and Softonic will address
   those concerns as soon as possible.

   Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones is a driver for Android app
   developers using Windows. It allows you to connect Samsung devices to a
   Windows PC via USB, and use them with your Android development
   application.

Do you need this program?

   If you simply want to connect your phone and view the files on it, any
   Windows PC will automatically download the necessary driver. You'll
   then be able to view your Samsung device in Windows Explorer. This is
   not the driver you need. An alternative to browsing your device with
   Windows Explorer is to use Samsung Kies, a very complete and user
   friendly way to manage the files, photos, and media on your Samsung
   device.

   You need Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones if you are developing
   Android apps and want to do some testing with a Samsung device.

How to use Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones

   To use Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones, simply unzip the file, and
   follow on screen instructions to install the drivers. You will need
   access to a Windows user account that has administrator rights. You can
   then use devices like the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S6, and Galaxy S4 in your
   development application. It's important that your Android app works
   well with Samsung devices, and this driver will assure you can test it
   without problems.

Essential for Android developers

   If you want to develop Android Apps and test them with Samsung devices,
   this is just what you need.
