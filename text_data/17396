   WE MOVE

   Temperatures rise
   Fibers break
   We breathe, we run.

   They try to break us
   Tensions high
   Dripping in gold, in sweat.

   We move, we run
   The heat keeps us going.

   Move. Sweat. Strengthen. Win.

   Handsome stays with you forever!
     * Use a mild detergent while hand washing it separately in cold
       water.
     * Pretty please don’t tumble dry, wring, soak or bleach your garment
       (that’s just cruel), it’s best to let it dry in the shade.
     * Try not to leave it rolled up and wet, make sure you rinse it
       really well after each use, especially if you’re spending a lot of
       time frolicking in an infinity pool – or a non-infinity pool for
       that matter!
     * Please don’t iron or dry-clean it.
     * Also, try to stay away from rough surfaces as it could cause
       pilling, and we all know that is not a good look.
