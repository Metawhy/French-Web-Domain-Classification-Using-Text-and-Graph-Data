   education for SCPro™ certified individuals. The purpose of this
   maintenance is to:

   activities
   » Support the global recognition of CSCMP’s SCPro™ certification
     __________________________________________________________________

   learning activities. Each continuing education activity yields one
   credit per one hour engaged in a learning activity.

   You are responsible for maintaining the documentation for the education
   programs you attend. The application process for maintaining your
   certification includes submitting documentation (details of the
