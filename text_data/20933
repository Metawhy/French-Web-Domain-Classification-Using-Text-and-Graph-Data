About Us

   About Us

Hi, Fit Soul Boss!

   So glad you are here. We are Lori and Michelle! Twin sisters.
   Entrepreneurs and spiritual fitness wellness coaches. We share our
   stories and what has helped us learn to love our bodies by overcoming
   our inner mean girl. We learned how to workout smarter, eat a mindful
   balanced diet with no restrictions and changed our thoughts to be more
   positive to heal our skin, health and body image issues. We are here to
   inspire women to eat, move, think and speak with more love and less
   shame. Our mission is to help women from all over stop obsessing over
   their bodies, get FIT in all areas of their lives (body, mind and soul)
   to rediscover their worth and unlock their true potential.
