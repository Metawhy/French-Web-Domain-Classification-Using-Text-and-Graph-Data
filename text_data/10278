Rising Above the Clouds: GeForce NOW’s Open Platform Elevates PC Gaming

   GeForce NOW going mobile with Android app.

   Cloud gaming has been picking up steam this year, but we’ve been
   enjoying the view from the cloud for quite some time. To the tune of 30
   million hours of gameplay, from over 1,000 games streamed from GeForce
   NOW servers.

   Since we launched the GeForce NOW public beta, we’ve been heads-down
   and laser-focused on developing the best cloud gaming service. And
   while we’re looking forward to launching the service out of beta in the
   coming months for the millions of gamers eager to play from the cloud,
   we’re closing in on a couple major milestones.

   First, we’re beginning the rollout of revolutionary GeForce RTX
   graphics performance to our GFN network, starting today with our
   Frankfurt, Germany, data center. Also, we’re extending GeForce NOW to
   more screens with Android mobile, available later this year.

   Expect to hear more information shortly from our GeForce NOW Alliance
   partners on their plans to roll out GeForce NOW in new regions. Our
   initial partners, Softbank and LG U+, are bringing GeForce NOW to Japan
   and Korea.

RTX Performance in the Cloud

   At our GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, we announced RTX
   Servers. Starting today, we’re beginning their rollout. Gamers in
   Northern California and Germany will be the first to take advantage of
   GeForce RTX performance. Over time, we’ll expand to our data centers
   throughout North America and Europe, enabling next-generation gaming in
   the cloud.

2 Billion New Screens to Game On

   Already in beta to the delight of 1 billion underpowered PCs that
   aren’t game ready, GeForce NOW will soon extend to one of the most
   popular screens in the world, Android phones — including flagship
   devices from LG and Samsung.

   Just like on PC, Mac and SHIELD TV, when the Android mobile app
   releases it’ll be in beta. We’ll continue improving and optimizing the
   experience. To take full advantage of the mobile experience, we’re
   recommending gaming with a Bluetooth gamepad, such as SHIELD
   controller, Razer Raiju Mobile, Steelseries Stratus Duo or Glap Gamepad
   (in Korea), as some games will be unplayable on an Android phone
   without a gamepad.

An Open Platform for Gamers, Publishers and Developers

   The service connects to popular digital game stores, allowing gamers to
   bring their game libraries with them. That includes new releases and
   hit titles like Control (coming soon), Fallout 76, Fortnite, Shadow of
   the Tomb Raider, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and World of Tanks. So you can
   play the games you already own across all your devices — PC, Mac and
   SHIELD — with more platforms coming later this year.

   We already support over 500 games, with compatibility for thousands
   more. And we’re exploring how our users can play more of their favorite
   games, even before they’re formally part of our library.

   Since games are purchased from popular digital stores, gamers still can
   download and play their games locally. So, a second purchase isn’t
   needed to play them in the cloud with GeForce NOW. This also means that
   developers don’t need to spend cycles porting their games to a new
   platform, nor is there a new business model being introduced to
   publishers.

Play the Future Today, as We Prepare for Tomorrow

   Available today on Mac, PC and SHIELD TV, GeForce NOW is transforming
   those devices into full-blown gaming rigs. It’s a gaming PC in the
   cloud for hardware that isn’t game ready.

   GeForce NOW is the first gaming rig that you never have to worry about
   upgrading, patching or updating. We handle all this for you, so you’re
   always moments away from playing your favorite games.

   And, like any great platform, GeForce NOW continues to improve. Look
   for big announcements coming later this year.

   The sun is starting to set on the free beta period, meaning gamers who
   want to play the future today should request access before it’s gone!

NVIDIA CUDA-X AI Acceleration Libraries Speed Up Machine Learning in the
Cloud by 20x; Available Now on Microsoft Azure

   Data scientists can now accelerate their machine learning projects by
   up to 20x using NVIDIA CUDA-X AI, NVIDIA’s data science acceleration
   libraries, on Microsoft Azure.

   With just a few clicks, businesses of all sizes can accelerate their
   data science, turning enormous amounts of data into their competitive
   advantage faster than ever before.

   Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (AML) service is the first major cloud
   platform to integrate RAPIDS, a key component of NVIDIA CUDA-X AI. With
   access to the RAPIDS open source suite of libraries, data scientists
   can do predictive analytics with unprecedented speed using NVIDIA GPUs
   on AML service.

   RAPIDS on AML service dramatically boosts performance for the many
   businesses across a wide range of industries that are using machine
   learning to create predictive AI models from their vast amounts of
   data. These include retailers that want to manage inventories better,
   financial institutions that want to make smarter financial projections,
   and healthcare organizations that want to detect disease faster and
   lower administration costs.

   Businesses using RAPIDS on AML service can reduce the time it takes to
   train their AI models by up to 20x, slashing training times from days
   to hours or from hours to minutes, depending on their dataset size.
   This is the first time RAPIDS has been integrated natively into a cloud
   data science platform.

   Walmart is an early adopter of RAPIDS, using it to improve the accuracy
   of its forecasts.

   “RAPIDS software has the potential to significantly scale our feature
   engineering processes – enabling us to run our most complex machine
   learning models to further improve our forecast accuracy,” said Srini
   Venkatesan, senior vice president of Supply Chain Technology and Cloud
   at Walmart. “We’re excited that Azure Machine Learning service is
   partnering with NVIDIA to offer RAPIDS and GPU-powered compute for data
   scientists so we can run RAPIDS in the Azure cloud.”

   RAPIDS on AML service comes in the form of a Jupyter Notebook that
   through the use of the AML service SDK creates a resource group,
   workspace, cluster and an environment with the right configurations and
   libraries for the use of RAPIDS code. Template scripts are provided to
   enable the user to experiment with different data sizes and number of
   GPUs as well to set up a CPU baseline.

   “Our vision is to deliver the best technology that helps customers do
   transformative work,” said Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of Azure
   AI at Microsoft. “Azure Machine Learning service is the leading
   platform for building and deploying machine learning models, and we’re
   excited to help data scientists unlock significant performance gains
   with Azure paired with NVIDIA’s GPU acceleration.”

   Learn more about NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries.

   Check out Microsoft Azure’s blog or attend this GTC session to learn
   about using RAPIDS on Azure Machine Learning service.

   You can’t be first if you’re not fast.

   Inside the world’s top companies, teams of researchers and data
   scientists are creating ever more complex AI models, which need to be
   trained, fast.

   That’s why leadership in AI demands leadership in AI infrastructure.
   And that’s why the AI training results released today by MLPerf matter.

   Across all six of six MLPerf categories, NVIDIA demonstrated
   world-class performance and versatility. Our AI platform set eight
   records in training performance, including three in overall performance
   at scale and five on a per-accelerator basis.
   Record Type Benchmark Record
   Max Scale
   (Minutes to Train) Object Detection (Heavy Weight) - Mask R-CNN 18.47
   mins
   Translation (Recurrent) - GNMT 1.8 mins
   Reinforcement Learning - MiniGo 13.57 mins
   Per Accelerator
   (Hours to Train) Object Detection (Heavy Weight) - Mask R-CNN 25.39 hrs
   Object Detection (Light Weight) - SSD 3.04 hrs
   Translation (Recurrent) - GNMT 2.63 hrs
   Translation (Non-recurrent) - Transformer 2.61 hrs
   Reinforcement Learning - MiniGo 3.65 hrs

   SSD, GNMT, Transformer: all use 0.6-20, MiniGo: 0.6-10

   These numbers — backed by Google, Intel, Baidu, NVIDIA and the dozens
   of other top technology companies and universities behind the creation
   of MLPerf’s suite of AI benchmarks — translate into innovation where it
   counts.

   Simply put, our AI platform now slashes through models that once took a
   whole workday to train in less than two minutes.

   Companies know unlocking that kind of productivity is key.
   Supercomputers are now the essential instruments of AI, and AI
   leadership requires strong AI computing infrastructure.

   Our latest MLPerf results bring all these strands together,
   demonstrating the benefits of weaving our NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs
   into supercomputing-class infrastructure.

   In spring 2017, it took a full workday — eight hours — for an NVIDIA
   DGX-1 system loaded with V100 GPUs to train the image recognition model
   ResNet-50.

   Today an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD — using the same V100 GPUs, now
   interconnected with Mellanox InfiniBand and the latest NVIDIA-optimized
   AI software for distributed AI training — completed the task in just 80
   seconds.

   That’s less time than it takes to get a cup of coffee.

   0.6-11 | Mask R-CNN: 0.6-23

The Essential Instrument of AI: DGX SuperPOD Masters Workloads Faster

   A close look at today’s MLPerf results shows the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD is
   the only AI platform able to complete each of the six MLPerf categories
   in less than 20 minutes:

   Transformer: 0.6-28, 0.6-6 | GNMT: 0.6-26, 0.6-5 | SSD: 0.6-27, 0.6-6 |
   MiniGo: 0.6-11, 0.6-7 | Mask R-CNN: 0.6-23, 0.6-3

   An even closer look reveals NVIDIA’s AI platform stands out on the
   hardest AI problems as measured by total time to train: heavyweight
   object detection and reinforcement learning.

   Heavyweight object detection using the Mask R-CNN deep neural network
   provides users with advanced instance segmentation. Its uses include
   combining it with multiple data sources — cameras, sensors, lidar,
   ultrasound and more — to precisely identify and locate specific
   objects.

   This type of AI workload helps train autonomous vehicles, providing
   precise locations of pedestrians and other objects to self-driving
   cars. Another real-life application helps doctors find and identify
   tumors in medical scans. Critical stuff.

   NVIDIA’s heavyweight object detection submission, which came in at just
   under 19 minutes, delivers nearly twice the performance as the next
   best submission.

   Reinforcement learning is another difficult category. This AI method
   trains robots working on factory floors to streamline production. It’s
   also used in cities to control traffic lights to reduce congestion.
   Using an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, NVIDIA trained the MiniGo AI
   reinforcement training model in a record-setting 13.57 minutes.

No More Time for Coffee: Instant AI Infrastructure Delivers World-Leading
Performance

   Speeding innovation, however, is about more than beating benchmarks.
   That’s why we made DGX SuperPOD not only powerful, but easy to set up.

   Fully configured with optimized CUDA-X AI software freely available
   from our NGC container registry, DGX SuperPODs deliver world-leading AI
   performance out of the box.

   They plug into an ecosystem of more than 1.3 million CUDA developers we
   work with to support every AI framework and development environment.

   We’ve helped optimize millions of lines of code so our customers can
   bring their AI projects to life everywhere you can find NVIDIA GPUs: on
   the cloud, in data centers and at the edge.

AI Infrastructure That’s Fast Now, Faster Tomorrow

   Better still, this is a platform that’s always getting faster. We
   publish new optimizations and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI
   software every month, with integrated software stacks freely available
   for download on our NGC container registry. That includes containerized
   frameworks, pre-trained models and scripts.

   With such innovation to the CUDA-X AI software stack, an NVIDIA DGX-2H
   server gained up to 80 percent more throughput on our MLPerf 0.6
   submissions than what we posted just seven months ago.

   | SSD: 0.5-21/0.6-20 | GNMT: 0.5-19/0.6-20 | Mask R-CNN: 0.5-21/0.6-20

   Add it up and these efforts represent an investment of tens of billions
   of dollars. All so you can get your work done fast today. And faster
   tomorrow.

NVIDIA Delivers More Than 6,000x Speedup on Key Algorithm for Hedge Funds

   NVIDIA DGX-2 and accelerated Python libraries provide unprecedented
   speedup for STAC-A3 algorithm used to benchmark backtesting of trading
   strategies.

   NVIDIA’s AI platform is delivering more than 6,000x acceleration for
   running an algorithm that the hedge fund industry uses to benchmark
   backtesting of trading strategies.

   This enormous GPU-accelerated speedup has big implications across the
   financial services industry.

   Hedge funds — there are more than 10,000 of them — will be able to
   design more sophisticated models, stress test them harder, and still
   backtest them in just hours instead of days. And quants, data
   scientists and traders will be able to build smarter algorithms, get
   them into production more quickly and save millions on hardware.

   Financial trading algorithms account for about 90 percent of public
   trading, according to the Global Algorithmic Trading Market 2016–2020
   report. Quants, specifically, have grown to about a third of all
   trading on the U.S. stock markets today, according to the Wall Street
   Journal.

   The breakthrough results have been validated by the Securities
   Technology Analysis Center (STAC), whose membership includes more than
   390 of the world’s leading banks, hedge funds and financial services
   technology companies.
   STAC Benchmark Infographic Click to view the infographic in full.

   NVIDIA demonstrated its computing platform’s capability using STAC-A3,
   the financial services industry benchmark suite for backtesting trading
   algorithms to determine how strategies would have performed on
   historical data.

   Using an NVIDIA DGX-2 system running accelerated Python libraries,
   NVIDIA shattered several previous STAC-A3 benchmark results, in one
   case running 20 million simulations on a basket of 50 instruments in
   the prescribed 60-minute test period versus the previous record of
   3,200 simulations. This is the STAC-A3.β1.SWEEP.MAX60 benchmark, see
   the official STAC Report for details.

   STAC-A3 parameter-sweep benchmarks use realistic volumes of data and
   backtest many variants of a simplified trading algorithm to determine
   profit and loss scores for each simulation. While the underlying
   algorithm is simple, testing many variants in parallel was designed to
   stress systems in realistic ways.

   According to Michel Debiche, a former Wall Street quant who is now
   STAC’s director of analytics research, “The ability to run many
   simulations on a given set of historical data is often important to
   trading and investment firms. Exploring more combinations of parameters
   in an algorithm can lead to more optimized models and thus more
   profitable strategies.”

   The benchmark results were achieved by harnessing the parallel
   processing power of 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs in a DGX-2 server and Python,
   which uses NVIDIA CUDA-X AI software along with NVIDIA RAPIDS and Numba
   machine learning software.

   RAPIDS is an evolving set of libraries that simplifies GPU acceleration
   of common Python data science tasks. Numba allows data scientists to
   write Python that is compiled into the GPU’s native CUDA, making it
   easy to extend the capabilities of RAPIDS.

   RAPIDS and Numba software make it possible for data scientists and
   traders to replicate this performance without needing in-depth
   knowledge of GPU programming.

   Creative and technical professionals can now access the latest
   advancements in photorealistic rendering, AI and VR while on the go,
   with the new lineup of NVIDIA Quadro RTX-powered mobile workstations.

   At the annual Computex conference in Taipei, NVIDIA today announced a
   full range of Turing architecture-based Quadro GPUs for mobile
   workstations from global system providers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo and
   MSI.

   Featuring Quadro RTX 5000, 4000 and 3000 GPUs — the world’s most
   powerful GPUs — the new mobile workstations are built to deliver
   desktop-level performance and capabilities in a mobile form factor.

   Artists, designers, architects and engineers routinely work away from
   the office, at customer sites or on the road. Whether creating
   high-quality video content, working with complex 3D designs or
   visualizing massive architectural datasets, they need a reliable,
   high-performance computer that keeps them in the creative flow, no
   matter where they’re working.

   The Quadro RTX mobile workstations ensure that professionals get the
   best possible experience when working with the latest design,
   engineering and creative applications from leading software providers
   such as Autodesk, Adobe, Dassault Systemes, Siemens, PTC, Chaos Group,
   Ansys, ESRI, Schlumberger and many more.

   They’re made possible by combining RTX-powered real-time photorealistic
   rendering, AI acceleration, 8K video editing and VR with massive GPU
   memory — up to 16GB — all packed in sleek and reliable system designs.

   The new lineup of mobile workstations also features Quadro T2000,
   T1000, P620 and P520 GPUs, giving professionals the flexibility to
   choose the right system to meet the demands of their diverse workloads.

CannonDesign, KPF and RED Digital Cinema Rely on Power of RTX

   Engineers, architects, artists and scientists are already experiencing
   dramatic benefits in their workflows using NVIDIA RTX technology on
   their desktop. With the introduction of Quadro RTX mobile workstations,
   professionals can now tap into the power of RTX from anywhere.

   At CannonDesign, a global architecture, engineering and construction
   firm, the combination of advanced ray tracing and AI with large,
   ultra-fast GPU memory is expanding what’s possible within their design
   process.

   “The RTX ray-tracing capabilities enable photorealistic reflections for
   spatial simulations, in ways one couldn’t even entertain before,” said
   Hilda Espinal, senior vice president and chief technology officer at
   CannonDesign. “Add to it the ability to handle some of our largest,
   highly detailed models and the technology translates into time savings
   and enhanced visual communications, creating new opportunities for
   real-time decision making.”

   Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF), an architecture firm based in New
   York, is using the power of RTX for interactive photorealistic
   rendering, enabling their designers to explore concepts and make
   changes on the fly.

   “The real-time ray-tracing and AI capabilities inherent in Quadro RTX
   GPUs have transformed the way we as architects visualize and process
   the data for our designs,” said Cobus Bothma, director of applied
   research at KPF. “The ability to interact with physically accurate
   models in real time means we’re making smarter design decisions faster.
   Now, with the latest RTX mobile workstations, we are excited about the
   possibilities out in the field, further freeing us to focus on creating
   our best work while saving clients time and money.”

   And RED Digital Cinema, a leading manufacturer of professional digital
   cinema cameras, leverages the advanced features of RTX GPUs to
   significantly enhance the user experience of video editing and
   production.

   “From GPU decoding to real-time 8K editing, we continually work with
   NVIDIA to deliver a better experience for our customers. For most of
   them, the ability to view and edit video on location during filming is
   critical,” said Jarred Land, president at RED Digital Cinema. “With
   NVIDIA powered laptops, it’s incredible to finally be able to edit 8K
   video in real time from anywhere you may be thanks to the new RED R3D
   SDK enhancements and NVIDIA GPUs.”

Quadro Workstations Available from Global OEMs

   Mobile workstations with the latest NVIDIA Quadro GPUs are certified on
   all industry-leading professional applications and are built with
   enterprise-grade quality and reliability standards. The new systems
   will start shipping in the second half of the year from global OEMs
   Dell, HP, Lenovo and MSI, as well as regional system builders.

   Here’s what our partners are saying about Quadro RTX-powered mobile
   workstations:

   “Dell workstations powered by Quadro RTX provide power, performance and
   reliability in one solution, offering cutting-edge technology like
   real-time ray tracing, AI acceleration and enhanced graphics
   performance. With the latest additions to our portfolios this week,
   NVIDIA and Dell are delivering the ultimate workstation experiences,
   allowing our customers to work efficiently and push their creativity to
   new heights.”

   — Tom Tobul, vice president of Specialty Products, Client Solutions at
   Dell

   “As creative workflows continue to evolve, NVIDIA Quadro RTX mobile
   GPUs meet the increasing needs of today’s creators. With Quadro RTX, Z
   workstations provide enhanced performance across the board, from
   accelerated rendering to photorealistic designs — so creators and
   designers can get desktop-level performance, no matter where they go.”

   — Carol Hess, vice president of Worldwide Z by HP, at HP

   “The new NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs for mobile workstations will push the
   boundaries of what’s possible for professionals across industries —
   both in the office and on the go. Lenovo is proud to support this new
   addition to the NVIDIA Quadro RTX portfolio — delivering the world’s
   most powerful mobile graphics card solution for professional
   workflows.”
