MWM makes music creation
accessible to anyone while
using the most advanced
technologies

About us

   Since 2012, MWM has been designing disruptive music apps and
   groundbreaking audio hardware products. Thriving for innovative
   solutions everyday, we intend to make music creation accessible to
   anyone while constantly expanding our ecosystem of products.

« MWM is the world’s number 3 mobile music app publisher registering more
than 250 million downloads across 182 countries ».

   Within the first 3 years, MWM has developed several apps covering
   popular music segments like Production, Gaming or Learning. In 2015,
   the company decided to go further and took up a new challenge:
   extending the use of its applications by developing musical hardware.
   This is how Mixfader was born, the world’s first wireless crossfader
   allowing DJs to scratch on the go with the lightest equipment ever
   conceived. The outstanding success of Mixfader led us to build close
   relationships with the most famous worldwide DJ champions. They helped
   us identify a recurring issue we decided to solve with our latest
   product Phase, the most awaited device of the DJ community this year
   that has already marked a new milestone in the industry of djing.

   MWM stands out for its international visibility and influence as 97% of
   our customers are based outside France. Our top-rated products are
   approved by a large number of international music addicts who eagerly
   await our presence at the most famous Tech and Audio events every year,
   such as NAMM or SXSW. In addition to our excellent BtoC relations, we
   are also renowned by the key actors of the Tech and Music sector,
   including Google, Apple and DJ Jazzy Jeff. We embrace workplace
   diversity by employing people from different backgrounds and origins.
   Together, we build a great team of 50 employees which keeps on growing
   very quickly!

#3 Music App Publisher worldwide

   2012 edjing-app

   At only 23 years of age, Jean-Baptiste Hironde created his own startup
   and took up a crazy challenge: making music creation accessible to
   everyone by conceiving highly innovative solutions. With the help of
   his best friend Nicolas Dupré, he launched edjing Mix in 2012, a DJ app
   that enables anyone to mix with a smartphone or tablet. Today, edjing
   Mix is the most downloaded DJ app in the world and registers more than
   80 millions downloads.
   2014 audio-technologie

   This first success pushed the young CEO to go further. Guided by the
   desire to build up his own musical ecosystem, he decided to reuse the
   audio technology previously developed for edjing Mix to multiply MWM’s
   product range from DJ production to utilitarian apps. From that moment
   on, MWM turned from a simple app developer into one of the most
   powerful music app editors in the world.
   2015 mixfader-product

   Determined to constantly provide music lovers while using the best
   digital technologies, MWM started extending the user experience by
   developing DJ hardware products. The company launched Mixfader, the
   world’s first connected crossfader which was at the origin of a new DJ
   movement called Portablism. Mixfader is currently available in 14
   countries.
   2017 mwm-logo

   MWM reached the symbolic threshold of 100 million downloads and ranked
   5th among the world’s largest music app publishers in the App Annie
   Index. In June 2017, MWM (ex DJiT) changed its name, embodying its
   ambition of becoming a major actor of the music industry by
   continuously expanding its app ecosystem.
   2018 mwm-hardware

   MWM announced the release of its second hardware product, Phase. It is
   the first device that enables DJs to mix on vinyl turntable while
   keeping the same level of stability and comfort as a digital
   controller. With the launch of this product, the company intends to
   revolutionize the market of turntablism which has remained static for
   the last 20 years. Phase has received excellent feedback and support
   among the most famous DJs in the world, including Jazzy Jeff, DJ Snake
   or the C2C. They are deeply convinced that Phase will change their
   mixing habits for ever.
   2019 mwm-team

   With more than 250 million downloads, MWM is gradually becoming the
   world’s #3 music app publisher. To continue this exponential growth, we
