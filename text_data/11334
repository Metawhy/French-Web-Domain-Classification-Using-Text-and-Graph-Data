   Why the Gambia's progress should spur abolition of the death penalty in
   Africa

   ot so long ago, abolition of the death penalty in the Gambia seemed
   like a pipe dream.

   In August 2012, under the regime of former president Yahya Jammeh, nine
   prisoners were executed in one night. The UN described the killings as
   “arbitrary”. Not even their families or lawyers were notified
   beforehand.

   Yet last month, on the 53rd anniversary of the country’s independence
   on 18 February, President Adama Barrow announced an official moratorium
   on executions as a step towards abolition of the death penalty.

   Belatedly but resolutely, the Gambia is moving away from this cruel,
   inhuman and degrading punishment. Almost half of the 18 countries in
   West Africa have now abolished the death penalty.

   But not all countries are progressing on the death penalty.
   Unfortunately some are taking steps backwards.

   In 2016, Sierra Leone’s Minister of Internal Affairs publicly ordered
   the gallows to be cleaned and affirmed his support of the death
   penalty, despite the former Attorney General making a commitment before
   the United Nations in 2014 that Sierra Leone would abolish the death
   penalty. In 2017, a government white paper rejected the Constitutional
   Review Commission’s recommendation to abolish it.

   Cases such as this highlight the need for a push for abolition of the
   death penalty in Africa.

   The reasons for abolition are many. For one, there is no credible
   evidence to prove that the death penalty deters crime. In a UN book
   published in 2015, Professor Jeffrey Fagan stated: “Whether the offense
   is murder, a drug related crime or terrorism, the scientific evidence
   for deterrence is unreliable, inconclusive and, in many instances,
   simply wrong.”

   The death penalty is also often discriminatory and used
   disproportionately against the poor and minorities. Often those
   executed are not only those who committed the worst crimes, but those
   who are too poor to hire skilled lawyers to defend themselves, or those
   who face particularly harsh prosecutors or judges.

   Amnesty International interviewed 107 death row prisoners out of 148 in
   Ghana between 2016 and 2017. Although three quarters of prisoners had a
   lawyer at their trial, appointed by the underfunded Ghana Legal Aid
   Scheme, several prisoners said that their lawyers did not attend all
   the hearings and they did not have enough time to talk to them. A
   number said their lawyers asked for payment.

   “My lawyer says he cannot work if he does not have money,” one man told
   me.

   According to the Ghana Prison Service, only 12 death row prisoners have
   appealed since 2006. Half of these appeals had been successful.
   However, most on death row did not know about their right to appeal or
   how to get legal aid, and less than a quarter of death row inmates had
   been able to appeal their cases.

   A woman told me a private lawyer asked for 60 million cedi (more than
   US$12 000) to file an appeal. Another said his appeal had stalled when
   his lawyer asked for more money.

   The death penalty is irreversible and does not leave any possibility
   for rehabilitation of the offender. No criminal justice system is
   capable of deciding fairly, consistently and infallibly who should live
   or die. The risk of executing the innocent can never be eliminated.

   I worked on an appeal for the longest serving woman on death row in
   Sierra Leone. MK was arrested for killing her step-daughter in 2003,
   and sentenced to death in 2005. She did not receive legal advice or
   assistance from the time of her arrest until before her trial in 2005.

   MK, who is illiterate, thumb-printed a confession which was later used
   during her trial. Granted a state-assigned defence lawyer at the
   beginning of the trial, she was able to discuss her case only three
   times and for no more than 15 minutes each.

   Upon conviction, she was not informed that she had only 21 days to
   appeal. Furthermore, her file was not sent to the President’s office
   for further review as required by law.

   MK was pregnant and had a miscarriage whilst in prison. A new lawyer
   hired by a local NGO, AdvocAid, filed an appeal before the Court of
   Appeal in 2008 but this was rejected as it was found to be too late.

   In November 2010, however, the Court of Appeal agreed to hear her case
   again. In March 2011 the Court of Appeal agreed with the AdvocAid
   lawyers representing MK that the various procedural irregularities
   during MK’s trial rendered it invalid. MK’s conviction was overturned
   and she was released after six years on death row.

   On 22 May 2017, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights
   adopted a resolution on the Right to Life in Africa. It urged countries
   that have established a moratorium on executions to take steps towards
   abolition, and others to immediately establish a moratorium on
   executions.

   While Francophone and Lusophone countries in West Africa are taking the
   lead on abolition, no Anglophone country in the region has abolished
   the death penalty. President Barrow’s announcement provides hope that
   perhaps the Gambia will be the first.

Money Talks - A key reason youths join Boko Haram

Change ahead: Experience and awareness of climate change in Africa

   Climate change is “the defining development challenge of our time,” and
   Africa the continent most vulnerable to its consequences, according to
   the African Union and the United Nations. Farmers in Uganda waiting
   endlessly for rain, cyclone survivors in Mozambique and Zimbabwe
   digging out of the mud and burying their dead – these images bring home
   what changing climate and increasingly extreme weather conditions may
   mean for everyday Africans.

Sales Tax Proposal: We are beating a dead horse

   The tribal wisdom of the Dakota tribe in the United States of America,
   passed on from one generation to the next, says that “when you discover
   that you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount”. In
   Zambia’s haste to pronounce VAT dead, the country has veered
   dangerously close to resurrecting a truly dead horse – one that died 25
   years ago – in the form of Sales Tax.
