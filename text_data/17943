FUTURE OF FASHION: Technology Drives Cultural Change. Just Ask William
Gibson.

   Fashion robot steven kelin (image)

     I find myself distracted outside Harajuku Station by a bevy of
     teenage manga nurses, rocker girls kitted out in knee-high black
     platform boots, black jodhpurs, black Lara Croft tops, and open,
     carefully starched lab coats, stethoscopes around their necks. The
     look clearly isn't happening without a stethoscope. They're doing
     the Harajuku hang - smoking cigarettes, talking on their little
     phones, and being seen.

   - author William Gibson in Wired (2001)

   Now, much as I adore Neuromancer (1984), Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988),
   Idoru (1999) and even Pattern Recognition (2003), I've never read
   Gibson for prose, per se. Nabokov, no doubt. Dickins, definitely.
   Naguib Mahfouz, most definitely. But Gibson...not so much.

   Fashion robot ex machina I certainly loved the way Neuromancer opened
   with “the sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a
   dead channel.” And Idoru deliciously depicted “a gray shudder beyond
   the windows of the silent train. Not as of surfaces rushing past, but
   as if particulate matter were being vibrated there at some crucial
   rate, just prior to the emergence of a new order of being.” These
   melodramatic touches, rooted in the legacy of pulp merchants like
   William S. Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon and Dashiell Hammett, have always
   given Gibson's work a certain infectious energy born of "pulp velocity
   and an odd techno-mysticism." And it's, without question, tasty...but
   more in that guilty-pleasure-Pringles way... you hate yourself, but
   can't stop at just one. (Ex Machina image via source)

   So when Gabriel Winslow-Yost recently bemoaned in The New Yorker about
   how threadbare, flat and attenuated Gibson's prose has become, my only
   quibble would be with become.

   But Gibson's writerly superpowers have never really had anything to do
   with his "increasingly irrelevant" characters and plotlines. Rather,
   the real star of the Gibson show is his take on the things we create.
   The technology. Take 2014's The Peripheral. Tasty tech touches include:
     * an old parka with “evil hydrophobic nanopaint on it…. The rain made
       a little sizzling sound, as it tried its fastest to get off the
       coated cotton.”
     * military “haptics” implanted into vets which cause a form of
       futuristic PTSD - “like phantom limbs, ghosts of the tattoos he’d
       worn in the war, put there to tell him when to run, when to be
       still, when to do the bad-ass dance”
     * animated, autonomous tattoos of wildlife all over a woman's body
       that are “a terrified tangle of extinct species, their black ink
       milling against her luminous pallor"

   Japan harajuku anime fashion style And teenage girls getting their
   bondage-nurse on in the streets of Tokyo. In musing about the way the
   private and the consensual interface in the hyper-trendy Harajuku nabe,
   Gibson - in his awesome piece in Wired - homes in on why this city
   represents the most compelling crystal ball we have for understand the
   shape "the future" will take, culturally. (image)

   Gibson traces the origins back to 1854, when Commodore Perry of the US
   Navy landed in Shogun-ruled Japan, ending 200 years of self-imposed
   isolation with yankee swagger backed up by gunboat diplomacy. "The
   Japanese," writes Gibson, "knew that America, not to be denied, had
   come knocking with the future in its hip pocket...The Industrial
   Revolution came whole, in kit form: steamships, railroads, telegraphy,
   factories, Western medicine, the division of labor - not to mention a
   mechanized military and the political will to use it."

   He then, deliciously, describes this showstopping entrance of "alien
   tech" to "the Roswell Incident as a trade mission." The American
   aliens, armed with their briefcases and plans, proceed to enact "a
   cultural retrofit from the scorched earth up." The graft of brazen
   American'ness onto the local feudal-industrial substrate essentially
   drop-kicked the Japanese into the future. Where they've since had more
   than 100 years to look around, get acquainted and settle on in.

   And learned how to live with it.

   Fashion robot Which is where the bondage-nurses or [insert "outrageous"
   fashion-pose-du-jour] come in: they represent a way of dreaming in
   public. Without danger. For in Harajuku, they have a safe-zone set
   aside for them. "In the face of drugs and slackers and a notable local
   increase in globalization," writes Gibson, "the Japanese, in the course
   of being booted down the timeline, have learned to keep it together in
   ways that we're only just starting to imagine. They don't really worry,
   not the way we do. The manga nurses don't threaten anything; there's a
   place for them, and for whatever replaces them." (image)

   For it is amidst the delirious electronic chaos of neon, gadgetry and
   e-hoopla that the future lurks. "I wish I had a thousand-yen note for
   every journalist who, over the past decade, has asked me whether Japan
   is still as futurologically sexy as it seemed to be in the '80s," says
   Gibson. "Watching the Japanese do what they do here, amid all this
   electric kitsch, all this randomly overlapped media, this chaotically
   stable neon storm of marketing hoopla, I've got my answer: Japan is
   still the future, and if the vertigo is gone, it really only means that
   they've made it out the far end of that tunnel of prematurely
   accelerated change. Here, in the first city to have this firmly and
   this comfortably arrived in this new century - the most truly
   contemporary city on earth - the center is holding." And more than just
   holding. Pointing...the way to the future. "Cultural change," he adds,
   is essentially technology-driven."

   - Lesley Scott

   Traditional and modern in japan Actively embracing the future - from
   technology to traditional gender roles - with a desire to make it
   fashionable and timely is a signature of the Futurenetic Fashion Tribe.
