       The Nearest Exit
       by Memory Drawings
       supported by 4 fans who also own “The music of chance”
       I keep going back and listening to this new disc by Memory
       Drawings, as it is all kinds of wonderful. Entirely instrumental,
       it features gorgeous hammered dulcimer and aching violins, and is a
       blend of ethereal sounds and dreamy orchestral passages with
       elements of ambient and shoegaze. It keeps hooking me in and
       drawing me back; this is an incredibly passionately emotive and
       meditative jewel. Eve McGivern

       The Nearest Exit
       by Memory Drawings
       supported by 4 fans who also own “The music of chance”
       I keep going back and listening to this new disc by Memory
       Drawings, as it is all kinds of wonderful. Entirely instrumental,
       it features gorgeous hammered dulcimer and aching violins, and is a
       blend of ethereal sounds and dreamy orchestral passages with
       elements of ambient and shoegaze. It keeps hooking me in and
       drawing me back; this is an incredibly passionately emotive and
       meditative jewel. Eve McGivern
