What is ChatSecure?

   ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OMEMO
   encryption and OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to your
   existing Google accounts or create new accounts on public XMPP servers
   (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra
   security.

   Unlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden,
   ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OMEMO
   or OTR and XMPP, such as Conversations (Android), CoyIM (Desktop), and
   more.

Strong Cryptography

   ChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to
   keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about
   "military grade" security but, without publicly auditable source code
   and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.
     * XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.
     * OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.
     * OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.
     * Tor to help bypass restrictive firewalls.
     * SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.
