New bookmark cards

   We've introduced a new bookmark card to the editor which allows you to
   present links in a much richer format! When using a URL with the right
   meta information, it can show the page title, excerpt, author,
   publisher and even a preview image. This is a great way to share links
   from sites that don't have automatic embeds. Here's an example of a
   bookmark card in action: Ghost Handlebars Themes - Building a custom
