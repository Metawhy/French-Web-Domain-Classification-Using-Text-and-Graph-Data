   Giant Clam - Great Barrier Reef

   To report a stranded, sick or dead marine animal phone 1300 ANIMAL
   (1300 264 625).

More than just fish and coral

   The Great Barrier Reef is home to a stunning array of animals, from
   microscopic plankton to whales weighing more than 100 tonnes. More than
   just fish and coral, the Reef supports:
     * 1625 species of fish, including 1400 coral reef species
     * More than 3000 species of molluscs (shells)
     * 630 species of echinoderm (starfish, sea urchins)
     * 14 breeding species of sea snakes
     * 215 species of birds including 22 species of seabirds and 32
       species of shorebirds
     * Six of the world's seven species of marine turtle
     * 30 species of whales and dolphins
     * One of the world's most important dugong populations
     * 133 species of sharks and rays
     * ....and much more

   The different types of animals found along the Reef help make it one of
   the richest and most complex natural systems on Earth. While there is a
   lot known about some animals that make the Reef home, vast amounts of
   information and species are yet to be discovered.

The Great Barrier Reef Biodiversity Strategy

   Great Barrier Reef animals form just one part of the ecosystem's
   immense biodiversity. We work to protect and conserve all elements of
   biodiversity, as outlined in our Biodiversity Conservation Strategy.

Species of conservation concern

   The Great Barrier Reef is a refuge for many species of conservation
   concern. We work to protect marine animal species that are threatened,
   iconic or at risk.

   By working closely with the state and federal government and the
   community, threats to species can be identified and appropriate
   management actions can occur.

   Protected species are those that are protected by law and need special
   management.

Snapshot of Reef animals

   Marine mammals ( whales, dolphins, dugong, seals) More than 30 species
   of marine mammals are found along the Great Barrier Reef. Bottlenose
   dolphins, humpback and dwarf minke whales are frequently seen while
   other species such as Bryde's whales are seldom seen or perhaps seldom
   recognised. The Great Barrier Reef is an important habitat for dugong.
   Birds, seabirds and shorebirds Islands and cays along the Great Barrier
   Reef support breeding populations of 22 seabird species. Areas of
   international significance for migratory and resident species of
   shorebirds are found on, or adjacent, to the Great Barrier Reef.
   Marine turtles Six of the worlds seven species of marine turtle occur
   on the Great Barrier Reef with globally significant nesting areas for
   four of these found in the Region. All six species are classified as
   threatened as a result of pressures both from within the Great Barrier
   Reef Region and elsewhere.
   Crocodile The estuarine crocodile can be found in most coastal waters
   and around many of the islands and cays of the Great Barrier Reef.
   Sea snakes Sitting in a global hotspot of sea snake diversity, the
   Great Barrier Reef is home to 14 different species of sea snake. This
   high number of different species is largely due to the Marine Park's
   variety of suitable habitat.
   Sharks and rays 133 species are found along the Great Barrier Reef and
   range from small, cryptic species such as the epaulette shark to large,
   migratory species such as the whale shark.
   Fishes Around 1625 of bony fish species including important commercial
   species such as coral trout.
   Echinoderms About 630 species recorded along the Great Barrier Reef,
   with starfish perhaps being the most well known.
   Crustaceans Around 1300 species, including a number that are
   commercially important (for example, some species of crabs and prawns).
   Molluscs More than 3000 species known from the Great Barrier Reef. This
   group includes  clams, oysters, squid, octopus, cuttlefish, nautilus,
   nudibranchs, chitons and snails.
   Hard corals The signature group of the Great Barrier Reef with more
   than 450 species known.
   Sea anemones Around 40 species recorded along the Great Barrier Reef.
   Soft corals and sea pens At least 150 species known from the Great
   Barrier Reef. With their swaying bodies and jelly like feel, soft
   corals bodies are made up of a large number of polyps connected by
   fleshy tissue.
   Jellyfish More than 100 species recorded along the Great Barrier Reef,
   including blue bottles and box jellyfish. Large adult jellyfish are
   often accompanied by small fish which hide amongst their tentacles for
   protection.
   Sponges Often colourful and common reef animals. Around 30 per cent of
   Australia's sponge species are found in the Great Barrier Reef.

   Crinoid - Great Barrier Reef

   Still more species make the Great Barrier Reef home and these include:
     * Bryzoans: around 950 species of tiny animals that form coral-like
       colonies and are often confused with corals
     * Worms: about 500 species have been recorded along the Great Barrier
       Reef
     * Marine insects and spiders: likely to be greater than five species
       of marine spider and more than 20 species of marine insects
     * Plankton: a major food source for a number of species
     * Ascidians/tunicates: sometimes called sea squirts, this group of
       around 720 species provide another splash of colour to the Great
       Barrier Reef.
