   a list of 5 fast, family-friendly dinner menu ideas for busy weeknights

   Hello, friends! Now that Fall is here, we’re swapping out lots of our
   summertime dinner favorites for cozier, heartier meals. We’re in a
   particularly busy stretch right now—we are in that magical season of
   life where we’re really lucky if we get everyone home and eating dinner
   together even a couple of times a week. So in this installment of Menu
   Ideas, I’m sharing busy weeknight dinners that A) are great for chilly,
   blustery fall weather; B) are easy to make; and C) I can make once and
   people can dish up as they have time between activities, meaning the
   food either reheats super well or can sit in a crockpot or on the stove
   stop and stay hot for several hours. Tough, but not impossible! Here we
   go!

   Poblano Skillet Enchiladas with homemade guacamole and shredded lettuce
   This yummy recipe from What’s Gaby Cooking had all the flavors of
   enchiladas in an easy-to-assemble, skillet-baked casserole. I used my
   own tomatillo salsa that I make every summer and freeze, and otherwise
   followed the directions exactly. I loved the inclusion of black beans
   and sweet corn. It gave the dish extra color as well as layers of
   flavor. We topped our enchiladas with sour cream, homemade guacamole,
   and finely shredded iceberg lettuce. Excellent reheated.

   Easy Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches with chips, grapes, and veggie
   sticks
   These french dip sandwiches from The Suburban Soapbox were so easy to
   make and so delicious. They are now on “the list.” They took about 15
   minutes of prep in the morning/early afternoon and then a couple of
   minutes right before serving, but they were well worth the minimal
   effort. My family loved loved loved them.

   Parmesan-Crusted Chicken with Creamy Lemon Tomato Spaghetti and a salad
   Over the summer, we tried Hello Fresh for a few months. If you’ve read
   through any of my previous Menu Ideas posts, you know I’m a big fan of
   Blue Apron. My sister’s family does Hello Fresh instead and really
   loves it, and they’re always offering free meals and incentives for
   signing up, so we decided to give it a try. And overall, we had a great
   experience! The meals are very easy to prepare and very
   family-friendly. Ultimately, we decided to quit getting meals from both
   delivery services simply because I couldn’t stand the amount of
   packaging I was throwing away every week. But the food was delish. This
   parmesan-crusted chicken was so good that I bought all the ingredients
   and made it again this week. It is really, really easy to make, super
   flavorful, and a big hit with the whole family, and the creamy lemon
   pasta is fantastic. PS, the “fry seasoning” called for in the recipe is
   a mix of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. I had the good sense
   to write that down when we had this chicken the first time, and I just
   mixed equal parts of all three spices together when I made it this
   week.

   Classic Chili with corn muffins and broccoli salad
   Chili is one of my go-to dinners during fall and winter. It requires
   very little work, but tastes amazing and is so cozy and comforting. My
   favorite chili recipe ever is a knock-off of Wendy’s chili, which I’ve
   never actually tried. Regardless of what this recipe is or is not based
   on, it’s delicious. I like mine topped with sour cream, shredded
   cheddar, and fritos, and my husband likes his with flour tortillas. We
   always make some version of corn muffins to go on the side, and this
   time we made a yummy broccoli salad to go along with it. Fall comfort
   food at its finest!

   Salsa Verde Chicken Street Tacos with pickled onions and a green salad
   The salsa verde chicken I made for the skillet enchiladas at the top of
   the list was so good and so easy that I used the recipe again (with a
   tiny bit of modification) for some street tacos. In addition to the
   green sauce the chicken braised in, I also added about 2 Tablespoons of
   homemade taco seasoning. It was great. We used those teeny tiny street
   taco tortillas and topped our tacos with sour cream, crumbled cotija,
   slices of fresh avocado, and quick pickled onions. I absolutely love
   pickled onions. They are a stunning shade of magenta, and they’re
   delicious and easy to make. Just combine 1 medium red onion, very
   thinly sliced, with 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup apple
   cider vinegar, a big pinch of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Simmer
   on the stove top until the mixture is bright pink and the onions are as
   tender as you want them. I’m fine with mine tender or a little crunchy.
   It doesn’t take much time. Let them cool and eat them up! The tacos
   didn’t need much in the way of sides, but I tossed together a green
   salad with homemade ranch and added some grilled corn to it, the last
   of the sweet corn from our garden. Yum! [photo from foodnetwork.com]

   So there you go, folks! Five easy, family-friendly dinner ideas for
   your busy weeknights. If you need even more ideas, feel free to browse

   meals that are must-tries, leave me a comment below!

   a list of 5 fast, family-friendly dinner menu ideas for busy weeknights

   Hello, friends! Now that Fall is here, we’re swapping out lots of our
   summertime dinner favorites for cozier, heartier meals. We’re in a
   particularly busy stretch right now—we are in that magical season of
   life where we’re really lucky if we get everyone home and eating dinner
   together even a couple of times a week. So in this installment of Menu
   Ideas, I’m sharing busy weeknight dinners that A) are great for chilly,
   blustery fall weather; B) are easy to make; and C) I can make once and
   people can dish up as they have time between activities, meaning the
   food either reheats super well or can sit in a crockpot or on the stove
   stop and stay hot for several hours. Tough, but not impossible! Here we
   go!

   Poblano Skillet Enchiladas with homemade guacamole and shredded lettuce
   This yummy recipe from What’s Gaby Cooking had all the flavors of
   enchiladas in an easy-to-assemble, skillet-baked casserole. I used my
   own tomatillo salsa that I make every summer and freeze, and otherwise
   followed the directions exactly. I loved the inclusion of black beans
   and sweet corn. It gave the dish extra color as well as layers of
   flavor. We topped our enchiladas with sour cream, homemade guacamole,
   and finely shredded iceberg lettuce. Excellent reheated.

   Easy Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches with chips, grapes, and veggie
   sticks
   These french dip sandwiches from The Suburban Soapbox were so easy to
   make and so delicious. They are now on “the list.” They took about 15
   minutes of prep in the morning/early afternoon and then a couple of
   minutes right before serving, but they were well worth the minimal
   effort. My family loved loved loved them.

   Parmesan-Crusted Chicken with Creamy Lemon Tomato Spaghetti and a salad
   Over the summer, we tried Hello Fresh for a few months. If you’ve read
   through any of my previous Menu Ideas posts, you know I’m a big fan of
   Blue Apron. My sister’s family does Hello Fresh instead and really
   loves it, and they’re always offering free meals and incentives for
   signing up, so we decided to give it a try. And overall, we had a great
   experience! The meals are very easy to prepare and very
   family-friendly. Ultimately, we decided to quit getting meals from both
   delivery services simply because I couldn’t stand the amount of
   packaging I was throwing away every week. But the food was delish. This
   parmesan-crusted chicken was so good that I bought all the ingredients
   and made it again this week. It is really, really easy to make, super
   flavorful, and a big hit with the whole family, and the creamy lemon
   pasta is fantastic. PS, the “fry seasoning” called for in the recipe is
   a mix of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. I had the good sense
   to write that down when we had this chicken the first time, and I just
   mixed equal parts of all three spices together when I made it this
   week.

   Classic Chili with corn muffins and broccoli salad
   Chili is one of my go-to dinners during fall and winter. It requires
   very little work, but tastes amazing and is so cozy and comforting. My
   favorite chili recipe ever is a knock-off of Wendy’s chili, which I’ve
   never actually tried. Regardless of what this recipe is or is not based
   on, it’s delicious. I like mine topped with sour cream, shredded
   cheddar, and fritos, and my husband likes his with flour tortillas. We
   always make some version of corn muffins to go on the side, and this
   time we made a yummy broccoli salad to go along with it. Fall comfort
   food at its finest!

   Salsa Verde Chicken Street Tacos with pickled onions and a green salad
   The salsa verde chicken I made for the skillet enchiladas at the top of
   the list was so good and so easy that I used the recipe again (with a
   tiny bit of modification) for some street tacos. In addition to the
   green sauce the chicken braised in, I also added about 2 Tablespoons of
   homemade taco seasoning. It was great. We used those teeny tiny street
   taco tortillas and topped our tacos with sour cream, crumbled cotija,
   slices of fresh avocado, and quick pickled onions. I absolutely love
   pickled onions. They are a stunning shade of magenta, and they’re
   delicious and easy to make. Just combine 1 medium red onion, very
   thinly sliced, with 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup apple
   cider vinegar, a big pinch of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Simmer
   on the stove top until the mixture is bright pink and the onions are as
   tender as you want them. I’m fine with mine tender or a little crunchy.
   It doesn’t take much time. Let them cool and eat them up! The tacos
   didn’t need much in the way of sides, but I tossed together a green
   salad with homemade ranch and added some grilled corn to it, the last
   of the sweet corn from our garden. Yum! [photo from foodnetwork.com]

   So there you go, folks! Five easy, family-friendly dinner ideas for
   your busy weeknights. If you need even more ideas, feel free to browse

   meals that are must-tries, leave me a comment below!

   a list of 5 fast, family-friendly dinner menu ideas for busy weeknights

   Hello, friends! Now that Fall is here, we’re swapping out lots of our
   summertime dinner favorites for cozier, heartier meals. We’re in a
   particularly busy stretch right now—we are in that magical season of
   life where we’re really lucky if we get everyone home and eating dinner
   together even a couple of times a week. So in this installment of Menu
   Ideas, I’m sharing busy weeknight dinners that A) are great for chilly,
   blustery fall weather; B) are easy to make; and C) I can make once and
   people can dish up as they have time between activities, meaning the
   food either reheats super well or can sit in a crockpot or on the stove
   stop and stay hot for several hours. Tough, but not impossible! Here we
   go!

   Poblano Skillet Enchiladas with homemade guacamole and shredded lettuce
   This yummy recipe from What’s Gaby Cooking had all the flavors of
   enchiladas in an easy-to-assemble, skillet-baked casserole. I used my
   own tomatillo salsa that I make every summer and freeze, and otherwise
   followed the directions exactly. I loved the inclusion of black beans
   and sweet corn. It gave the dish extra color as well as layers of
   flavor. We topped our enchiladas with sour cream, homemade guacamole,
   and finely shredded iceberg lettuce. Excellent reheated.

   Easy Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches with chips, grapes, and veggie
   sticks
   These french dip sandwiches from The Suburban Soapbox were so easy to
   make and so delicious. They are now on “the list.” They took about 15
   minutes of prep in the morning/early afternoon and then a couple of
   minutes right before serving, but they were well worth the minimal
   effort. My family loved loved loved them.

   Parmesan-Crusted Chicken with Creamy Lemon Tomato Spaghetti and a salad
   Over the summer, we tried Hello Fresh for a few months. If you’ve read
   through any of my previous Menu Ideas posts, you know I’m a big fan of
   Blue Apron. My sister’s family does Hello Fresh instead and really
   loves it, and they’re always offering free meals and incentives for
   signing up, so we decided to give it a try. And overall, we had a great
   experience! The meals are very easy to prepare and very
   family-friendly. Ultimately, we decided to quit getting meals from both
   delivery services simply because I couldn’t stand the amount of
   packaging I was throwing away every week. But the food was delish. This
   parmesan-crusted chicken was so good that I bought all the ingredients
   and made it again this week. It is really, really easy to make, super
   flavorful, and a big hit with the whole family, and the creamy lemon
   pasta is fantastic. PS, the “fry seasoning” called for in the recipe is
   a mix of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. I had the good sense
   to write that down when we had this chicken the first time, and I just
   mixed equal parts of all three spices together when I made it this
   week.

   Classic Chili with corn muffins and broccoli salad
   Chili is one of my go-to dinners during fall and winter. It requires
   very little work, but tastes amazing and is so cozy and comforting. My
   favorite chili recipe ever is a knock-off of Wendy’s chili, which I’ve
   never actually tried. Regardless of what this recipe is or is not based
   on, it’s delicious. I like mine topped with sour cream, shredded
   cheddar, and fritos, and my husband likes his with flour tortillas. We
   always make some version of corn muffins to go on the side, and this
   time we made a yummy broccoli salad to go along with it. Fall comfort
   food at its finest!

   Salsa Verde Chicken Street Tacos with pickled onions and a green salad
   The salsa verde chicken I made for the skillet enchiladas at the top of
   the list was so good and so easy that I used the recipe again (with a
   tiny bit of modification) for some street tacos. In addition to the
   green sauce the chicken braised in, I also added about 2 Tablespoons of
   homemade taco seasoning. It was great. We used those teeny tiny street
   taco tortillas and topped our tacos with sour cream, crumbled cotija,
   slices of fresh avocado, and quick pickled onions. I absolutely love
   pickled onions. They are a stunning shade of magenta, and they’re
   delicious and easy to make. Just combine 1 medium red onion, very
   thinly sliced, with 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup apple
   cider vinegar, a big pinch of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Simmer
   on the stove top until the mixture is bright pink and the onions are as
   tender as you want them. I’m fine with mine tender or a little crunchy.
   It doesn’t take much time. Let them cool and eat them up! The tacos
   didn’t need much in the way of sides, but I tossed together a green
   salad with homemade ranch and added some grilled corn to it, the last
   of the sweet corn from our garden. Yum! [photo from foodnetwork.com]

   I’m really excited to share this new recipe with you guys. These
   bacon-wrapped chicken thighs are really easy to make, so they’re great
   for weeknights. They also look fancy enough for weekend meals or
   special occasions. Regardless of when you decide to make them, they are
   tender, delicious, and flavorful, so you’ll be winning at the dinner
   game.

   I love using RANGER® and ROXY™ products from Draper Valley Farms. They
   come from free-range chickens raised locally in the Pacific Northwest
   in Washington and Oregon. They’re fed a non-GMO, 100% vegetarian diet,
   and they have no antibiotics ever. For this recipe, I used RANGER® Free
   Range Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs. I love chicken thighs because
   they turn out flavorful and juicy when you cook them.

   I wanted to give these chicken thighs a sweet, smoky flavor perfect for
   chilly Fall evenings. I started by rubbing the thighs with a blend of
   brown sugar and spices like garlic and smoky sweet paprika. Then I
   wrapped the chicken thighs with applewood smoked bacon and cooked them
   to a deep golden brown in a cast-iron skillet. After cooking the
   chicken, I made a savory-sweet pan sauce with shallots, thyme, and
   apple cider. The finished dish is so flavorful and delicious, with the
   perfect balance of savory, sweet, and smoky. I know you’re going to
   love it!

   Serves: 3-4 servings
   Ingredients
     * 1 package RANGER® Free Range Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs
       (about 1½ pounds)
     * 1 Tablespoons brown sugar
     * ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
     * ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
     * ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
     * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
     * ½ teaspoon onion powder
     * ¼ teaspoon ground mustard
     * 5-6 slices applewood smoked bacon (1 slice per chicken thigh)
     * 2 Tablespoons butter, divided
     * 4 teaspoons minced shallots
     * 1½ teaspoons minced fresh thyme
     * ½ cup apple cider
     * 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar
     * minced fresh parsley for garnish

   Instructions
    1. Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. In a small bowl,
       combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion
       powder, and mustard. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels,
       then generously season both sides of each chicken thigh with the
       spice mixture. Use up all of the spice mixture. Wrap each seasoned
       chicken thigh with a slice of bacon, then place the chicken into
       the hot skillet. Cook on one side for 8-10 minutes until golden
       brown, then flip and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked
       through, about 13-14 more minutes. If you have a meat thermometer,
       the temperature of the chicken should be 170°F when it is fully
       cooked. Remove the chicken from the skillet, place it on a plate,
       and set it aside while you make the pan sauce. Drain all of the
       bacon fat from the skillet. Add half of the butter to the skillet.
       Add the shallots and thyme, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until tender
       and fragrant. Add the apple cider and simmer until the liquid has
       reduced slightly, 1-2 minutes. Add the remaining butter and the
       apple cider vinegar, and cook until the butter is melted. Remove
       from heat. Add the chicken back to the pan, spoon a little sauce
       over each chicken thigh, top with minced fresh parsley, and serve.
