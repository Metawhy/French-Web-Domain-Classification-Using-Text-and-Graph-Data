          Parents: You Can’t Control Your Baby’s Digital Footprint

But it will be OK.

   Who really controls your child’s photos?

   This article is part of Future Tense, a collaboration among Arizona
   State University, New America, and Slate. On Nov. 20, Future Tense will
   host “Will the Family Survive the Revolution in Reproductive
   Technology?” in Washington, D.C. For more information about the event
   and to RSVP, visit the New America website.

   While Brianna was pregnant with her daughter, Abigail, she planned to
   keep pictures of Abigail completely off social media. But a few weeks
   after Abigail was born, Brianna’s sister-in-law posted a picture of the
   new baby on Facebook, foiling Brianna’s plan. (All names of mothers and
   children in this article are pseudonyms, as they were in the original
   research study.)

   Brianna considered herself a fairly active social media user, and at
   one point she had about 1,000 Facebook friends. But she wanted to guard
   Abigail’s privacy as well as give her daughter the chance to shape her
   own online presence. Unfortunately, children today won’t have that
   luxury—they will inherit their digital footprints. Just as parents’
   genes and child-rearing techniques help shape a child’s identity,
   parents’ digital habits will construct their children’s online
   identities, at least until children are old enough to take the reins.

   I interviewed Brianna and 21 other mothers as part of a research study
   with University of Michigan School of Information professor Sarita
   Schoenebeck that examined the decision-making process to post baby
   pictures online. While most mothers felt comfortable sharing pictures
   of their children online, many also expressed concern over their
   inability to control where that information went. These 22 mothers by
   no means represent the experiences of all parents, but their insights
   provide a starting point to consider how parents’ use of digital
   technology can affect their children.

   I sympathize with Brianna’s position because she was unable to carry
   out one of the first parenting decisions she made. But one thing is
   clear: Control is no longer an effective paradigm to evaluate the
   relationship between privacy and information. When your baby pictures
   appear on Instagram, Dropbox, Gmail, and Grandma’s phone, who really
   controls them? The terms of service and privacy policies that govern
   these tools evolve constantly, and absolute control over information is
   impossible, even for experts. Not to mention that newborns have no
   control over their pictures being taken in the first place.

   Focusing on control over information made sense when people kept
   physical photographs. In a pre-Web age, the pictures of you splashing
   in the bath or smearing birthday cake on your face sat in albums or
   shoeboxes, viewed only when Mom pulled them out of the closet. When
   these pictures appear online, they reach a much broader (and
   potentially unknown) audience, and people can easily make copies of the
   pictures. This also means that other people can use baby pictures in
   unintended, potentially disturbing, ways. For instance, Fast Company
   recently discussed the alarming “baby role-playing” subculture, in
   which people take photos of kids from strangers’ social media accounts
   and pretend online that the children are their own.

   It’s tempting to suggest that parents shouldn’t post baby pictures
   online, but this ignores the very real benefits they experience from
   doing so. Sharing pictures online helped the mothers I interviewed feel
   connected with family and friends, which is especially important for
   parents whose friends and family don’t live nearby. They received
   social support and validation, which is helpful when dealing with loss
   of sleep and the overwhelming responsibility of caring for a tiny human
   being. For those who cherished their experience of motherhood, sharing
   pictures online created a record of those memories. Also, family and
   friends constantly ask to see more baby pictures, so parents may feel
   some pressure to share them online.

   At the same time, mothers recognized that by sharing pictures online,
   they were making decisions on behalf of their children that couldn’t be
   easily reversed. Eventually, their children would grow up and develop
   opinions about what they wanted their parents to share and not share
   online.

   Rather than seek to control their children’s digital footprints,
   parents can engage in what we call privacy stewardship. This means that
   parents should consider what types of information they feel are and are
   not appropriate to share about their children online and then
   communicate their preferences to family and friends. About half of the
   mothers in our study talked with their husbands about sharing baby
   pictures online. Two mothers included their sharing preferences in
   birth announcement emails. Rebecca asked people to avoid posting
   pictures of her daughter on Facebook, and Judy asked people not to post
   her son’s first name on Facebook.

   Nevertheless, it’s impossible to control other people’s actions. Judy’s
   mother-in-law sometimes posted her son’s first name in Facebook
   comments, and Judy sent her text-message reminders when that happened.
   Lindsay’s sister-in-law re-posted pictures that Lindsay had shared on
   her own Facebook profile, despite Lindsay’s preference that others not
   post pictures of her daughter online. Clara’s mother shared a picture
   of her son Ryan’s first bath on Facebook. Clara didn’t want naked
   pictures of Ryan to be online, but she didn’t say anything because she
   wanted to honor her mother’s decision. The experiences of these mothers
   illustrate the inevitability that even some information that parents
   don’t want online will likely find its way to the Web.

   Privacy stewardship acknowledges that sharing decisions vary from
   parent to parent. Parents can share a lot of information about their
   child online and still look out for their child’s best interest. Take
   Marina and Cara. Marina’s best friend maintained a popular YouTube
   channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, and Marina happily
   let her friend feature her son in a few videos. Cara created a Facebook
   profile for her son, and she posted pictures and videos that depicted
   the full spectrum of his developing personality, from acting cute to
   throwing a tantrum.

   While both mothers frequently shared pictures of their sons online,
   they did not share indiscriminately. Marina would not share a picture
   of her son crying because she wanted her friends and family to see him
   as a happy-go-lucky child. Cara once removed a picture she posted of
   her son eating a breadstick because she did not want people to
   interpret it as sexually suggestive.

   Raising a child is (and has always been) hard. Managing the online
   footprint of a child may feel like yet another task on an ever-growing
   list of parental responsibilities. But if parents let go of the idea of
   trying to control their child’s digital footprint and instead consider
   how to steward their child’s privacy, the task just might feel more
   manageable.
