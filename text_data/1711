Organized Pantry

   I *finally* organized our pantry!  The before photos are embarrassing,
   but I'll post them anyway...and they aren't even accurate depictions of
   what it looked like because Gary had already cleaned some of the
   shelves off!!  Mortifying.

   I didn't take a "before" of this side of the pantry because not much
   changed- I like all my canned goods on display and easy to see, even
   though it's not as pretty as having it all tucked away out of sight. ;)

   These bins with the little dip in the front are IKEA Pluggis bins...
   [DSC_0008.jpg]
   All of the rest of the white bins are IKEA Kuggis, and they all come
   with lids...

   These big Kuggis bins are great for hiding junk...I tend to accumulate
   tons of party supplies, paper goods, etc., and I hated that it was all
   over my pantry!  I also always have a lot of extra baggies, plastic
   wrap, etc...

   These are also IKEA...I'm not sure if they have a name, the label just
   says IKEA 365+

   The baskets on the floor are IKEA Bullig.  I keep things like dog
   treats, disposable coffee cups, Solo cups and flours/seeds...
   [IMG_6829.jpg]
   And here is what it looked like before I labeled everything- I actually
   love it because it's so clean looking, but I had to label the bins with
   lids, and I wasn't sure that Gary and the kids would even be able to
   figure out what is supposed to go in the open bins without labels. ;)

Fire Pit

   This might be my favorite area- I love it!

   Turning the corner and looking towards our side yard and fence that
   hides the pool equipment...

Balls!

   They installed the concrete balls on the fire pit pillars- I love them!
   We also got 2/3 of the cushions (apparently there was a bit of a
   misunderstanding as to how many cushions we need).

   The cabana is finally getting done! The posts are finished and ready to
   be painted...

   And the back wall is done and ready to be painted- they did such a
   great job with the paneling!

A White Wall

   I don't think the photos do it justice, but painting the ugly brown
   wall white has made a HUGE difference! It looks a million times better!
