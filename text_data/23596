Abstract

   The silver ion is among the most toxic of heavy metal ions,
   particularly to microorganisms and to fish. The ease with which Ag
   forms insoluble compounds, however, reduces its importance as an
   environmental contaminant. Ag is not likely to concentrate to harmful
   levels through either terrestrial or aquatic food chains. There is some
   possibility that Ag from cloud seeding will retard growth of algae,
   fungi, bacteria, and fish in fresh water; additional laboratory
   investigations are needed. Inhibition of aquatic microorganisms would
   interfere with the cycle that returns essential nutrients to the water.
   Ag in air and water should be regularly monitored. Iodine in AgI poses
   no environmental danger. Organic seeding agents currently being
   proposed are not likely to be toxic in either the short or the long
   run, but dispersal of proprietary organic compounds should be
   prohibited unless their composition is fully revealed.

Abstract

   The processes that accompany the death of an oceanic plate, as a ridge
   nears a trench, remain enigmatic. How the plate might reorganize,
   fragment, and eventually be captured by one of the bounding plates are
   among the unresolved details. We present a tomographic model of the
   Pacific Northwest from onshore and offshore seismic data that reveals a
   hole in the subducted Juan de Fuca plate. We suggest that this hole is
   the result of a tear along a preexisting zone of weakness, is causing
   volcanism on the North American plate, and is causing deformation in
   the Juan de Fuca plate offshore. We propose that in the final stages of
   an oceanic plate's life, deformation on the surface can be driven by
   deeper dynamics and that the fragmentation and the eventual capture of
   oceanic plate fragments may be governed by a process that operates from
   the bottom up.

Plain Language Summary

   A hole in a subducted plate, in the mantle beneath North America, may
   cause volcanism and earthquakes on the surface of the Earth. Volcanism
   on the surface of North America appears to have been spatially
   coincident with a known zone of weakness on the slab for the last ~17
   million years. We suggest that this hole is caused by tearing along the
   zone of weakness, a feature that is created when the plate is formed at
   the ridge. The tearing not only causes volcanism on North America but
   also causes deformation of the not‐yet‐subducted sections of the
   oceanic plate offshore. This tearing may eventually cause the plate to
   fragment, and what is left of the small pieces of the plate will attach
   to other plates nearby.

1 Introduction

   In principle, the natural end of an oceanic plate's life is when the
   ridge that creates that plate reaches a subduction zone. Exactly how
   this occurs in practice, and what geophysical phenomena might accompany
   it, remains poorly understood. The Cascadia Subduction Zone, where the
   young Juan de Fuca (JdF) plate subducts beneath the western margin of
   North America, provides an ideal location to study this process. The
   JdF plate is the northern remnant of the Farallon plate and represents
   the final stages of tens of millions of years of continuous subduction
   beneath the western margin of North America (Atwater, 1970).
   Furthermore, unsubducted fragments of the Farallon plate remain off the
   coast of western North America (Atwater, 1970; Wang et al., 2013),
   having been incorporated into the Pacific plate. These fragments
   provide a different snapshot in time of the same system, and evidence
   for how the final state of the Pacific‐North America‐JdF system might
   look. In this study, we present an S wave velocity model using seismic
   data from arrays both onshore and offshore in this region to illuminate
   the link between subduction zone architecture, subduction dynamics,
   deformation, and volcanism, both in the subducting and the overriding
   plates, to shed light on the mechanisms that accompany the death of an
   oceanic plate.

   Two key features that we will address are the internal deformation of
   the Gorda section of the JdF plate and the High Lava Plains (HLP)
   volcanic province (Figure 1). The Gorda region, which is the
   southernmost section of the JdF plate, is undergoing intense
   deformation, primarily in the form of strike‐slip faults that trend
   NE‐SW near the ridge, transitioning to NW‐SE farther from the ridge
   (Wilson, 1989, 2002). This deformation is thought to be because the
   Mendocino Transform, which bounds the Gorda region to the south, has
   not reoriented as the Gorda and JdF ridges have rotated clockwise since
   10 Ma. The Pacific plate just south of the transform was created at
   approximately 30 Ma (Atwater, 1970) and is thus colder and stronger
   than the much younger Gorda region, whose oldest unsubducted fabric was
   created at only 6 Ma (Wilson, 2002). Furthermore, the rotation of the
   ridge system has generated propagator wakes (Hey, 1977; Wilson, 1990),
   which are formed by overlapping segments of the ridge that migrate
   along the ridge axis. Propagator wakes extend down into the
   lithospheric mantle and are locally more highly fractured—and likely
   weaker—than the rest of the plate (Han et al., 2016; Horning et al.,
   2016; Nedimović et al., 2009). These features can be seen as offsets in
   the magnetic anomalies (Figure 1). Propagator wakes have been linked to
   increased intermediate‐depth seismicity due to dehydration (Nedimović
   et al., 2009).

   the Juan de Fuca and Pacific plates are shown as white arrows relative
   to North America. Magnetic isochrons offshore are from Wilson (2002).
   Thick contours east of the subduction zone indicate depth to the Juan
   de Fuca slab in km (McCrory et al., 2012). Thinner contours in southern
   Oregon represent 1‐Ma isochrons of westward propagating High Lava
   Plains volcanism (Jordan, 2005).

   The HLP is a volcanic province that extends from southeastern to
   central Oregon. Bimodal volcanism has occurred in the HLP since the
   mid‐Miocene, marked in particular with rhyolitic features that show a
   distinct age progression, starting in southeastern Oregon, and
   migrating toward W15°N, at a rate of 33 mm/year from 10 to 5 Ma, and 13
   mm/year from 5 Ma to the present (Jordan, 2005). This age progression
   makes the HLP unique from the other significant volcanism that has
   occurred in the region in Tertiary time and thus implies a different
   mechanism. Current volcanism lies approximately 40 km east of the
   central Cascade arc axis. The age‐progressive rhyolitic volcanism,
   accompanied by widespread basaltic volcanism, resembles in many ways
   the Yellowstone Snake River Plain, generally considered to be the
   result of a mantle plume (Camp & Ross, 2004; Pierce & Morgan, 1992).
   Furthermore, the origin of the age progression for these two provinces
   appear to be very similar in time and space: the Columbia River Basalt
   eruptions, at ~17 Ma. While the mantle plume model fits many
   observations of the Yellowstone volcanic track, it is not consistent
   with other observations in the HLP, including the direction of age
   progression (Ford et al., 2013; Jordan, 2005) and helium isotope
   analysis (Graham et al., 2009). The most complete explanations for the
   HLP involve the JdF slab, either by a lateral tear in the slab at depth
   (Liu & Stegman, 2012), by large‐scale Farallon‐induced mantle flow
   (Zhou et al., 2018), or by asthenospheric flow induced and focused by
   rollback of the strong, coherent JdF slab in the upper mantle (Ford et
   al., 2013; Long et al., 2012).

   We generate a tomographic model from teleseismic S wave data that shows
   that the slab below ~150‐km depth is discontinuous along strike,
   consistent with other models of the region (Bodmer et al., 2018; Hawley
   et al., 2016; James et al., 2011; Obrebski et al., 2010; Roth et al.,
   2008; Schmandt & Humphreys, 2010). We argue that the discontinuous slab
   may be driving volcanism in the HLP, similar to results of geodynamic
   simulations of the region (Liu & Stegman, 2012; Zhou, Liu, & Hu, 2018).
   We further contend that the fragmentation of the JdF slab at depth is
   driving deformation on the surface and that the final stages of the
   life of an oceanic plate are dominated by bottom‐up disintegration,
   rather than a simple cessation of subduction when the ridge meets the
   trench.

2 Data and Methods

   We construct large‐scale 3‐D images of the interior structure of the
   Earth using observations of seismic phases generated by distant
   earthquakes. Two seismic arrays, the Cascadia Initiative (Toomey et
   al., 2014) and EarthScope's Transportable Array, provide excellent
   coverage of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (Figure 1). Using observations
   of 34,670 direct teleseismic S wave arrivals from 217 events on these
   two arrays and other regional arrays, we have constructed an S wave
   isotropic velocity model of the regional mantle through
   finite‐frequency tomographic inversion. The methodology is detailed in
   Obrebski et al. (2010). Our model domain is a spherical cap that
   extends from 27°N to 50°N, from 133°W to 101°W, and from the surface to
   2,500‐km depth, with 65 nodes in each dimension. The model box is
   larger than the region in which we expect to have good resolution;
   delays that are not easily accounted for within the model domain will
   be absorbed at the edges of the model.

   Horizontal components of ocean bottom seismometers are plagued both
   with uncertainty in orientation and with higher noise, so we have
   picked the arrivals on the vertical component. The noise
   characteristics of the ocean bottom seismometers also require that we
   filter in a narrower band pass (20–40 s) than is commonly performed for
   onshore body wave tomographic studies. We calculate the
   frequency‐dependent sensitivity kernels (Dahlen et al., 2000). Our
   inversion minimizes the misfit in delay times by solving simultaneously
   for the isotropic velocity perturbation at each node, and a single
   correction term for each station and each event (Figure S1 in the
   Supporting Information). The station corrections remove delays
   associated with the sediments and crust immediately beneath the
   station, minimizing contamination of the mantle velocity structure.
   Although station correction terms can absorb some of the real signal
   from the mantle, we choose to incorporate them because imposing crustal
   and lithospheric velocities introduces uncertainties that are difficult
   to quantify.

3 Tomographic Model

   Our model, CASC19‐S, is broadly consistent with CASC16‐P, our previous
   P wave model of the region (Hawley et al., 2016), as well as other
   tomographic models of the Pacific Northwest (Bodmer et al., 2018; James
   et al., 2011; Obrebski et al., 2010; Roth et al., 2008; Schmandt &
   Humphreys, 2010). The JdF slab appears as a high seismic velocity
   feature that trends north and dips to the east (Figure 2). At 80‐km
   depth, this feature is continuous from about 40°N to the edge of our
   model at 50°N. By 150‐km depth, the high‐velocity slab is not visible
   from roughly 44°N to 46°N. While the precise depth of this gap differs
   from model to model, it is a robust feature of virtually every
   tomographic model that has been produced in this region, with
   resolution beneath ~150‐km depth, since the deployment of the
   Transportable Array here in 2006. Most of the models that do have
   resolution at this depth are teleseismic body wave tomographic models,
   which generally have lateral resolution on the order of the station
   spacing, in this case ~70 km. The vertical resolution of this type of
   model is not as good. Since the rays are traveling nearly vertically in
   the upper mantle, velocity anomalies tend to be smeared vertically,
   along the path of the incoming rays. Thus, again, while the depth of
   the hole is different in the models we reference here, the fact that
   there is a gap in the high velocities is robust.

   Slices through the tomography model, CASC19‐S. Contours represent
   +0.25% dV[S]. In the slice at 80‐km depth (a), the slab is continuous
   north‐south, with variations along strike in the strength of the
   recovered signal. By 150‐km depth (b), the slab has a prominent gap
   between ~44°N and 46°N. The depth extent of the slab is shown in two
   vertical slices, with a bold slab contour from (McCrory et al., 2012).
   The slice through the hole at 45°N (c) shows no high‐velocity slab
   feature coincident with the McCrory et al. (2012) slab surface. The
   other shows that the Gorda slab at 41°N (d) extends at least to 400 km,
   and possibly 600‐km depth.

   The hole has been noted and interpreted by previous authors. Initially,
   it was proposed to be an artifact owing to significantly reduced
   velocities in the mantle wedge (Roth et al., 2008). Since then, there
   has generally been consensus that the hole is not an artifact, but the
   creation of the hole has been attributed to a range of processes,
   including Yellowstone plume‐induced slab destruction (Obrebski et al.,
   2010), along‐strike variations in dynamic pressure from the mantle
   beneath the slab (Liu & Stegman, 2011), and simply evidence for complex
   subduction (James et al., 2011; Schmandt & Humphreys, 2010).

   To reiterate that the apparent hole is not an artifact due to low
   velocities in the overlying mantle wedge, we point to a recent receiver
   function study (Cheng et al., 2017) that was able to resolve impedance
   structure between 100 and 200 km, where the hole appears in the
   tomographic models. A strong high‐velocity feature situated immediately
   beneath a strong low‐velocity feature would be difficult to resolve
   using teleseismic body wave tomography. Because, however, receiver
   functions are sensitive to sharp vertical velocity gradients, such a
   scenario would be detectable using that method. The fact that the size
   and depth extent of the hole is similar in both tomographic images and
   receiver function images makes an artifact an unlikely explanation for
   the feature.

4 Interpretation

   The active expression of the HLP trend lies directly above the southern
   edge of the slab hole we image in CASC19‐S. Slab holes have been
   inferred in other subduction zones (Obayashi et al., 2009; Portner et
   al., 2017), sometimes accompanied by anomalous volcanism (Berk Biryol
   et al., 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2008). Dry basalts in the HLP have been
   explained by upwelling mantle in the backarc due to rollback of the
   coherent JdF slab (Ford et al., 2013; Long et al., 2012; Till et al.,
   2013), but as the tomography models do not show a coherent slab, we
   explore the possibility that the volcanism is generated by
   asthenospheric flow through the hole and subsequent decompression
   melting.

4.1 Causes of the Hole

   The distinct age progression in the HLP suggests that if the volcanism
   is due to a tear in the slab, that tear is propagating updip. We can
   then estimate the speed and direction of this tear on the JdF slab by
   subtracting the JdF motion from the HLP motion, both of which are known
   with respect to North America (vector sum in Figure 3a). The JdF plate
   is subducting at ~35 mm/year toward N55°E relative to North America
   (Wilson, 1993), indicating that the tear velocity in the JdF plate has
   been, on average, approximately 50 mm/year toward S75°W. This trend
   closely matches that of a prominent propagator wake in the northern
   Gorda region (Wilson, 2002; Figure 3a). Since propagator wakes are
   thought to be weaker than the rest of the plate (Canales et al., 2017;
   Horning et al., 2016; Nedimović et al., 2009), a tear along this
   preexisting zone of weakness is a possible scenario. The precise depth
   of the hole is difficult to locate using teleseismic body wave
   tomography and appears at different depths in different models. Since,
   however, the resultant volcanism lies to the east of the arc, we can be
   reasonably confident that the tear is below 100‐km depth. We stress
   that the depth of this deformation will preclude brittle failure—there
   are no earthquakes clearly associated with the tearing. The slab would
   instead thin along this weak region, eventually pulling apart (Figure
   4).

   Detailed maps showing the causes and effects of the hole in the Juan de
   Fuca slab. A slice at 150‐km depth through CASC19‐S is shown with
   surface topography in both images. In (a), we focus on the relationship
   of the hole as seen in tomography with the propagator wake on the Juan
   de Fuca slab (gray shaded region; Wilson, 2002) and High Lava Plains 1
   Ma isochrons (Jordan, 2005). The inset shows the proposed trace of the
   rupture on the Juan de Fuca slab, calculated by subtracting Juan de
   Fuca plate motion from the propagation of HLP volcanism, both with
   respect to North America. In (b), we focus on the resultant deformation
   of the Juan de Fuca plate. The southern extent of tremor activity (gray
   shaded region; Wech, 2010) and slab surface contours (dotted lines,
   labeled in kilometers; McCrory et al., 2012) match the slab extent in
   CASC19‐S, extending well south of the Mendocino Transform. Focal
   mechanisms are all offshore earthquakes from the GCMT catalogue south
   of 43°N, with M[W] > 6.3.
   image
   Figure 4
   Open in figure viewerPowerPoint
   A schematic model that links the slab hole with other physiographic
   features. The view is from the east, and the Juan de Fuca slab is shown
   in blue. The propagator wake (bold gray line underneath Oregon) causes
   a weakness in the slab along which a tear is propagating. The High Lava
   Plains (contours in Oregon) lie above the southern edge of the slab
   hole. The Gorda slab rotates clockwise, causing intraplate seismicity
   in the Gorda region.

   At first glance, it seems unexpected that the volcanism would rest over
   the southern edge of the hole, rather than in the middle. Carefully
   considering the geometry of the slab and propagator wake, and
   uncertainty in the precise shape of the hole as imaged with seismic
   tomography, helps to explain why the volcanism is over the southern end
   of the imaged hole. Shear wave splitting measurements (Long et al.,
   2009) and recent geodynamical modeling (Zhou et al., 2018) indicate the
   horizontal component of mantle flow is largely east‐west, and we thus
   expect little north‐south flow between the tear and the volcanism on
   the surface. The NE‐SW orientation of the propagator wake means that
   the deeper parts of the feature are situated farther to the north. The
   southern edge of the hole, then, would extend generally toward the east
   with depth, while the northern edge of the hole would trend generally
   to the northeast with depth. Thus the entirety of a hole resulting from
   this propagator wake will be to the north and east of the shallow tear,
   and any vertical smearing in the tomographic images will result in low
   velocities being imaged to the north, but not to the south. We suggest
   that this is the reason the propagator wake aligns with the southern
   edge of the imaged hole.

   A number of other propagator wakes are mapped in Wilson (2002). Only
   one of these propagator wakes is larger than the one we show in
   Figure 3, and it has additionally been associated with increased
   seismicity (Nedimović et al., 2009). At depth, this propagator wake is
   not associated with a region of low velocities and thus does not appear
   to be related to a similar tear in the slab. All of the other (smaller)
   propagator wakes are well north of our model domain by the time they
   reach ~100‐km depth, and we will not speculate about whether similar
   tears may be happening elsewhere.

   The existence of a propagator wake may not be a necessary condition at
   all. A tear has developed in the subducting slab in various geodynamic
   models of the region, both those that use as a starting condition a
   density field derived from seismic tomography (Zhou, Liu, & Hu, 2018),
   and those that use only surface constraints to define the boundary
   conditions (Liu & Stegman, 2011). In particular, these recent
   geodynamical studies have suggested that both the HLP and the Snake
   River Plain age‐progressive volcanic tracks are a result of hot oceanic
   asthenosphere intruding into the mantle beneath North America (Zhou,
   Hu, et al., 2018; Zhou, Liu, & Hu, 2018) and do not explicitly model a
   hole in the downgoing slab. Thus, while the propagator wake is not
   necessary for anomalous HLP volcanism in the western United States, it
   is a specific and striking explanation that connects a structural
   feature inherited from creation at a mid‐ocean ridge with an unusual
   but robust hole imaged in seismic tomography, and with anomalous
   volcanism on the overriding North American plate.

4.2 Effects on the Subducting JdF Plate

   We have argued, as have other authors, that slabs can tear in the
   mantle and that this process can generate volcanism above the tear. We
   also show that the fragmentation of the slab in the mantle may be
   responsible for deformation within the JdF plate. The disintegration of
   the slab would allow a clockwise rotation of the southern fragment,
   which is connected to the Gorda section of the JdF plate. Clockwise
   rotation of this southern fragment is consistent with the observed
   southern edge of the subducting slab (Figure 3b). This edge can be seen
   trending southeastward in a number of data sets, including the extent
   of nonvolcanic tremor (Wech, 2010), a slab model constrained by
   microseismicity, and active source seismic studies (McCrory et al.,
   2012), as well as our own tomographic model. This edge traces back to
   the Mendocino Transform between the JdF and Pacific plates, which
   trends east‐west. The conjugate fracture zone on the Pacific plate is
   remarkably straight for more than 1,000 km, also trending east‐west.
   Absent deformation, it would be expected that the southern edge of the
   JdF slab would maintain the same strike. Wilson (2002) suggests that
   this is due to the stability of the Mendocino transform despite the
   rotation of the JdF ridge system. While this “snowplow” effect could
   generate the observed deformation, it also can be easily explained by
   clockwise rotation of the southern slab fragment as it moves through
   the subduction zone and in to the mantle.

   Furthermore, the process we propose is consistent with deformation
   within the Gorda region. This deformation manifests primarily as
   left‐lateral strike‐slip faulting on northeast‐southwest trending
   faults. These are found in Gorda crust older than 2 Ma and south of the
   propagator wake (focal mechanisms in Figure 3b). We suggest these are
   en echelon faults as a result of clockwise rotation of the Gorda
   section relative to the Pacific and central JdF plates. Again, while
   this deformation could be partially explained by the snowplow effect
   from the rotation of the JdF ridge relative to the Mendocino Transform,
   the process of slab fragmentation as we describe it here would have the
   same effect.

4.3 Implications for Subduction Termination

   Our connection of nonrigid behavior in the Gorda lithosphere with the
   fragmentation of the JdF slab at depth suggests that the death of an
   oceanic plate is a bottom‐up process. Instead of subducting normally
   until the ridge meets the trench, a plate may begin to break apart on
   the surface as the ridge approaches the trench, driven by fragmentation
   of a weak slab in the mantle. This should not be surprising, given
   that, for example, there is significantly more plate surface area that
   is slab attached to the Gorda section of the JdF plate than there is
   Gorda lithosphere on the surface. Burkett and Billen (2009) describe
   numerical models in which slab detachment occurs before ridge
   subduction; our conceptual model differs from this in two distinct
   ways: first, the deformation occurs on a preexisting zone of weakness
   inherited from the formation of the plate, and second, the tear is not
   occurring laterally, parallel to the trench, but is originating from
   much deeper in the subducting slab.

   If subduction ends before the ridge arrives at the trench, the
   surviving plate fragment will attach to one of the two plates that is
   bounding it—in the case of JdF, either the Pacific plate or the North
   American plate. Older fragments, such as the Magdalena, Guadalupe, and
   Monterey microplates, are seen in seafloor magnetic data, having been
   incorporated into the Pacific plate (Nicholson et al., 1994). It has
   been suggested that these plate fragments have stagnant slabs attached
   to them, extending into the mantle as deep as 200 km (Wang et al.,
   2013).

   Alternatively, slabs can accrete onto the overriding plate, becoming
   the building blocks of a new continent. Old terranes, accreted onto
   North America, may still have visible slab fragments attached to them,
   such as the Llano and the Cheyenne slabs (Porritt et al., 2014). It is
   possible that the Gorda, followed by the rest of the JdF, will accrete
   onto North America in a similar fashion. Regardless of which plate the
   fragments of the JdF will accrete onto, our analysis suggests that the
   capture of these oceanic plate fragments is driven by processes in the
   mantle, which may, in turn, be driven by along‐strike variations in the
   lithospheric structure inherited at the ridge.

5 Conclusions

   A holistic analysis of seismic, geologic, petrologic, and marine
   geophysical data suggests that as the JdF plate nears the end of its
   life, disintegration of the slab in the mantle drives deformation on
   the surface. A hole in the subducting JdF slab as seen in seismic
   tomography is coincident with age‐progressive volcanic activity in the
   HLP, and closely matches a weak zone in the JdF plate, raising the
   possibility that these three phenomena are related. We suggest that a
   tear along the weak propagator wake encourages asthenospheric flow
   through the hole in the slab, generating volcanism in southeastern and
   central Oregon. The resulting fragmentation of the slab in the mantle
   affects the stress state on the surface, leading to nonrigid motion in
   the Gorda section of the JdF plate. Furthermore, comparing with
   magnetic and seismic studies elsewhere, we suggest that this surficial
   fragmentation will persist as highly deformed geologic features, and
   the resulting fragments of the slab, unable to subduct, may accrete
   onto either the Pacific or the North American lithosphere. If our
   interpretation is correct, the Gorda section of the JdF plate provides
   an excellent ongoing example of the processes that govern the demise of
   a long‐lived oceanic plate.

Abstract

   Western North American (WNA) glaciers outside of Alaska cover
   14,384 km^2 of mountainous terrain. No comprehensive analysis of recent
   mass change exists for this region. We generated over 15,000
   multisensor digital elevation models from spaceborne optical imagery to
   provide an assessment of mass change for WNA over the period 2000–2018.
   These glaciers lost 117 ± 42 gigatons (Gt) of mass, which accounts for
   up to 0.32 ± 0.11 mm of sea level rise over the full period of study.
   We observe a fourfold increase in mass loss rates between 2000–2009
   [−2.9 ± 3.1 Gt yr^−1] and 2009–2018 [−12.3 ± 4.6 Gt yr^−1], and we
   attribute this change to a shift in regional meteorological conditions
   driven by the location and strength of upper level zonal wind. Our
   results document decadal‐scale climate variability over WNA that will
   likely modulate glacier mass change in the future.

Plain Language Summary

   Glaciers in western North America provide important thermal and flow
   buffering to streams when seasonal snowpack is depleted. We used
   spaceborne optical satellite imagery to produce thousands of digital
   elevation models to assess recent mass loss for glaciers in western
   North America outside of Alaska. Our analysis shows that glacier loss
   over the period 2009–2018 increased fourfold relative to the period
   2000–2009. This mass change over the last 18 years is partly explained
   by changes in atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used for
   future modeling studies to understand the fate of glaciers under future
   climate change scenarios.

1 Introduction

   Anthropogenic warming is expected to drive continued mass loss from
   alpine glaciers throughout the remainder of this century (Marzeion et
   al., 2017). Relative to other alpine environments, glaciers in western
   North America (WNA) are expected to play a minor role in future sea
   level rise (Levermann et al., 2013; Marzeion et al., 2018; Radić et
   al., 2014) given their small, cumulative volume (Huss & Farinotti,
   2012). These ice masses, however, represent important freshwater
   reservoirs that provide late‐summer meltwater runoff when seasonal
   snowpacks have been depleted (Frans et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2009)
   or during years characterized by drought (Jost et al., 2012). Water
   managers require up‐to‐date assessments of how these ice masses have
   and will likely change in the coming decades.

   A global assessment of glacier mass change by Gardner et al. (2013)
   included an estimate of WNA glacier mass loss of 14 ± 3 Gt yr^−1 for
   the period 2003–2009 based on the extrapolation of sparse in situ
   surface mass balance (SMB) measurements (Cogley, 2009). Other
   approaches to estimate glacier mass change, such as satellite laser
   altimetry and satellite gravimetry employed by Gardner et al. (2013)
   for other glacierized regions, have so far proven unsuccessful for WNA
   due to sparse repeat‐track spacing at lower latitudes and challenges
   associated with deconvolving competing mass change signals
   (groundwater, seasonal snow, reservoir volumes and glacio‐isostatic
   adjustment). Such methods perform particularly poorly for
   lower‐latitude mountain ranges with disperse glacier coverage, such as
   those that characterize WNA (Gardner et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2012).

   Repeat mapping of surface elevation through stereophotogrammetry
   provides an additional approach to measure glacier thickness change on
   a regional scale that can circumvent spatial and temporal biases
   imposed by using SMB observations to estimate regional mass change.
   Geodetic surveys exist for many glacierized regions of WNA (e.g.,
   Basagic & Fountain, 2011; Schiefer et al., 2007), but no study samples
   all of these regions in a systematic fashion. Novel methods to infer
   elevation change from medium resolution satellite imagery (Brun et al.,
   2017) coupled with automated processing of both medium and very high
   resolution optical satellite imagery (Noh & Howat, 2017; Shean et al.,
   2016) provide new opportunities to improve global estimates of glacier
   mass change.

   The primary motivation of our paper is to provide the first, regionally
   complete estimate of glacier mass change for WNA for the period
   2000–2018. We then use these data to (i) quantify the contribution of
   WNA glaciers to sea level rise over the last 18 years, (ii) determine
   the reliability and representativeness of existing WNA in situ SMB
   records, and (iii) assess the climatic drivers that affect mass change
   at the subregional scale.

2 Materials and Methods

   Here we use the term WNA to define glaciers of Region 2 from the
   Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI‐6.0), which is the most comprehensive
   digital ice coverage map for WNA (RGI Consortium, 2017). Glaciers cover
   14,384 km^2 of mountainous terrain in WNA with 88% of glacier coverage
   in British Columbia and Alberta, 7% in the conterminous United States
   (CONUS), and 5% in the Yukon and Northwest Territories (Figure 1 and
   Table 1). To provide regional comparisons of mass change, we subdivided
   glacierized terrain into 15 regions (Figure 1 and Table 1). In British
   Columbia, we use the same regions as those described in previous work
   (Clarke et al., 2015; Schiefer et al., 2007).

   The primary data set we use to assess glacier mass change over the last
   18 years consists of digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained from the
   Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)
   visible and near infrared instrument. The multispectral sensor collects
   both nadir and aft visible imagery with a native ground sample distance
   of 15 m and a swath width of ~60 km (Abrams, 2000; Raup et al., 2000).
   Our workflow for ASTER DEM generation (see supporting information S1)
   processes all ASTER scenes for 1 × 1° tiles that contain a minimum
   glacier area of 5 km^2. In British Columbia and Alberta, glacier
   extents in RGI‐6.0 originate from Landsat imagery acquired between 2004
   and 2006 (Bolch et al., 2010), whereas ice extents from Yukon,
   Northwest Territories, and CONUS originate from multiple sources with
   varied acquisition dates (Fountain et al., 2017; Kienholz et al., 2015;
   Pfeffer et al., 2014). For the CONUS regions, all glacier outlines of
   the RGI‐6.0 covering less than 0.1 km^2 were removed, which excludes
   less than 0.5% of all WNA ice cover from our analysis.

   For DEM generation we used two open‐source software packages for the
   mass production of DEMs from satellite stereoscopic imagery: the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Stereo Pipeline
   (ASP) (Beyer et al., 2018; Shean et al., 2016) and the Ohio State
   University's Surface Extraction from TIN (triangulated irregular
   network)‐based Search‐space Minimization (SETSM; Noh & Howat, 2015,
   2017). We used ASP to generate 15,500 DEMs with 30‐m posting from ASTER
   stereoscopic imagery acquired between 2000 and 2018. We supplemented
   the ASTER DEMs with 693 higher‐resolution (2 to 8 m) DEMs generated
   from submeter resolution DigitalGlobe WorldView‐1, WorldView‐2,
   WorldView‐3, and GeoEye‐1, and three DEMs generated from Pléiades
   satellite imagery (e.g., Berthier et al., 2014). WorldView/GeoEye data
   for CONUS were processed using ASP, while those over Canada were
   processed using SETSM. These non‐ASTER DEMs, though temporally limited,
   increased repeat coverage for accumulation areas where ASTER DEMs often
   contain data gaps due to lack of surface texture at lower spatial and
   radiometric resolution. Their inclusion also increased sample count for
   trend fitting compared to the ASTER record.

   Unlike many conventional geodetic mass balance studies that difference
   elevation data over glaciers between two epochs (e.g., Gardner et al.,
   2013; Schiefer et al., 2007), we evaluate per pixel linear trends for
   overlapping DEMs over the last 18 years (e.g., Willis et al., 2012).
   Our method builds upon the techniques described for glacier mass change
   in the French Alps (Berthier et al., 2016) and high‐mountain Asia (Brun
   et al., 2017). We calculate the temporal trend in elevation (dh/dt)
   over stable and ice‐covered terrain, the latter defined as those
   regions that lie within polygons of the RGI‐6.0 glacier inventory.
   Time‐variable glacier outlines are not available, so we use constant
   glacier area outlines for the full 18‐year period (supporting
   information S1).

   Individual DEMs were resampled to 30 m and coregistered over all
   stable, subaerial terrain excluding ice cover, and lakes (supporting
   information S1) using the Nuth and Kääb (2011) approach and the Global
   DEM (GDEMv2; Tachikawa et al., 2011) as a reference. Once DEMs are
   coregistered, we perform linear weighted least squares regression for a
   given map coordinate[{x, y}] with elevation z[{t1, t2, …, tn}], where
   the subscript x,y refers to the local Universal Transverse Mercator
   projection easting and northing of a given DEM of time t. This method
   provides an estimate of elevation change (dh/dt) at coordinate[{x, y}]
   with associated error taken to be the confidence interval of the
   regression about the linear fit (supporting information S1). To
   calculate volumetric change (dV/dt) for a given elevation band, we use
   hypsometric extrapolation where volume change is the summed product of
   average dh/dt for a given elevation band and its corresponding area. We
   use a density of 850 ± 60 kg m^−3 to convert dV/dt to mass change
   (Huss, 2013). Global sea level equivalence is calculated using a
   density for water of 1,000 kg m^−3 and an ocean surface area of
   3.6 × 10^14 m^2 (Amante, 2009).

   Our uncertainty analysis consists of both random and systematic errors.
   Random errors are dominated by DEM quality (precision) and
   coregistration success; it can be approximated by the standard
   deviation (σ[z]) of elevation change from stable surfaces corrected for
   spatial autocorrelation (Rolstad et al., 2009). Any seasonal elevation
   variability (e.g., snow cover and vegetation) is also included in this
   metric. Full details describing the propagation of errors, including
   systematic errors, are provided elsewhere (supporting information S1).

   To calculate changes in rates of mass change at the decadal scale, we
   split the elevation data set into two epochs of equal duration [1 June
   2000 to 15 September 2009 and 1 June 2009 to 15 September 2018]
   hereafter referred to as early [2000–2009] and late [2009–2018]. We did
   not consider changes in rates on timescales less than a decade because
   of relatively high errors in the individual ASTER DEMs and potentially
   insufficient temporal sampling.

   We also analyzed geopotential height (500 hPa), temperature (700 hPa),
   precipitation, and wind (zonal, meridional, and speed) from ERA5
   (Hersbach & Dee, 2016) for the two study epochs to evaluate
   climatological drivers for observed glacier mass change. The ERA5 is a
   global reanalysis product that consists of 107 vertical levels on a
   31‐km grid, assimilates the greatest number of surface‐ and
   satellite‐based observations of any reanalysis product, and currently
   extends from January 2000 to August 2018. Temperature at 700 hPa is
   approximately 3,100 m above sea level, and so approximates air
   temperatures above the elevation of most glaciers in WNA. Interannual
   to interdecadal climate variability is known to affect mass change of
   WNA glaciers (Bitz & Battisti, 1999; Hodge et al., 1998; Moore et al.,
   2009; Watson et al., 2006), so we also evaluated whether decadal change
   in glacier mass were explained by any major shifts in ocean‐atmospheric
   phenomena known to affect climate in WNA (supporting information S1).

3 Results

   The DEMs cover over 99.5% of the WNA glacierized terrain, with
   statistically significant elevation change for 82% of those surveyed
   areas. Coverage for the early [2000–2009], late [2009–2018], and full
   periods [2000–2018] over glacierized terrain respectively averages 45%
   (10 DEMs per pixel), 45% (8 DEMs per pixel), and 80% (13 DEMs per
   pixel). Fortunately, the most heavily glacierized subregions of our
   study domain contain a suitable number of DEMs to minimize
   uncertainties for all three periods during the 1 × 1° tile aggregation.
   High random and systematic errors exist for some subregions (e.g.,
   Olympic Mountains, Table 1) with limited available stable terrain for
   coregistration. We observe the highest uncertainty in the Interior
   Ranges and Canadian Rocky Mountains (Table 1) due to reduced temporal
   coverage (average of nine DEM samples per pixel). While some
   subregions, such as the Sierra Nevada, North Cascades, and South
   Cascades, have greater sample depth (26 DEMs per pixel on average),
   they still yield mass change estimates with moderate uncertainties due
   in part to the high errors caused by uncertainties in mapped glacier
   extent. Temporal subdivision increases the uncertainty in our mass
   change estimates due to the reduced sample size of each epoch relative
   to the full 2000–2018 period of study (supporting information S1).

   We also calculated mass change using sequential DEM differencing of
   independent high‐resolution data for 175 glaciers in British Columbia
   (Figure S1 and Table S1). Comparison of these changes over common
   periods of time suggests that our ASTER‐based elevation trends (Figure
   S5) represent unbiased estimates of mass change for glaciers larger
   than 0.5 km^2 (supporting information S1).

   WNA experienced spatially variable glacier elevation change over the
   period 2000–2018 (Figure 1). When elevation change is aggregated for
   subregions, small glaciers in the northern interior ranges of British
   Columbia thinned most, whereas our trend analysis is unable to detect
   elevation change that is statistically different from zero for glaciers
   within the South Cascades and Glacier National Park over the last
   18 years (Figure 1 and Table 1). Large glaciers sourced from icefields
   in the southern Coast Mountains experienced high rates of thinning (>
   10 m yr^−1) at low elevations (Figure 2). When averaged over all
   regions, WNA glaciers lost −6.5 ± 2.3 Gt yr^−1 during the period
   2000–2018 (Table 1). Ninety‐eight percent of this mass change
   originated from Canadian glaciers with ice loss in the southern Coast
   Mountains accounting for 58% of the total mass loss.

   Cascades). Gray areas denote no data.

   Our results show a fourfold increase in rates of mass loss between the
   early (−2.9 ± 3.1 Gt yr^−1) and late periods (−12.3 ± 4.6 Gt yr^−1),
   with notable regional differences (Figure 1). A prominent dipole in
   rates of mass change exists between the British Columbia central Coast
   [50–55°N] and the Cascade mountains [42–47°N] of the United States
   (Figure 1). During the early epoch, mass change was less negative for
   glaciers in the southern latitudes of British Columbia, whereas
   glaciers in the Cascade Mountains experienced high rates of mass loss
   (Table 1). This pattern reversed during the late period when glacier
   mass loss from the southern Coast Mountains increased by a factor of
   4.8. Glaciers in the south Cascades showed slight mass gain with no
   detectable mass change in the north Cascades (Figure 2 and Table 1).

   The ERA5 fields reveal changes in wind speed, temperature, and
   precipitation between the early and late periods (Figure 3). The
   north‐south dipole in mass change along the U.S.‐Canada border
   (Figure 1) coincide with a shift in the average location of the
   midlatitude jet, here defined as the maximum velocity for upper‐level
   (250 hPa) winds. Regional composites of monthly averaged
   column‐integrated moisture flux (kg·m^−1·s^−1), temperature (K) at
   700 hPa, and precipitation (m yr^−1) over the early and late periods
   likewise reveal latitudinal differences in those meteorological
   conditions that influence SMB. Regional composites of geopotential
   height in the Northern Hemisphere also show a zone of lower than normal
   pressure across the latitude band [42–47°N] with an area of higher than
   normal pressure across most of British Columbia (supporting information
   S1). These differences in geopotential height are maximized for the
   winter season (October–May), but they also occur during summer
   (June–September). During the last decade wet conditions coincided with
   areas of lower‐than‐average geopotential height in the Pacific
   Northwest whereas the central Coast Mountains experienced warm, dry
   conditions (Figure 3).

   An examination of the relation between meteorological conditions and
   glacier mass change at time scales finer than a decade is not possible
   given the number of DEMs required for statistically significant
   elevation trend analysis. Cumulative departures of monthly
   precipitation anomalies for the 31‐km ERA5 grid cell near Mount Rainier
   in the North Cascades (Figure 2), however, reveals that the period
   2000–2007 was characterized by drier than average conditions. An
   increase in precipitation commenced after 2011 for that location
   whereas a decrease in precipitation occurred over the central Coast
   Mountains after 2012.

   Previous estimates of geodetic mass change for WNA glaciers at the
   subregional scale are primarily limited to British Columbia and Alberta
   (Schiefer et al., 2007). Our estimates and those from Schiefer et al.
   (2007) show a complex pattern of mass change (Figure 4), with most of
   these subregions showing mass loss for the period 1985–1999. Rates of
   mass loss slowed from 2000 to 2009 and then increased from 2009 to 2018
   (Figure 4). The southern Coast Mountains alone contain nearly half of
   the total ice cover of WNA, and the rate of mass loss over the last
   9 years was −7.4 ± 1.9 Gt yr^−1, about 20% faster than the period
   1985–1999.

4 Discussion and Implications of Our Study

   Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of glacier mass change
   (−6.5 ± 2.3 Gt yr^−1) for nearly all glacierized terrain in WNA over
   the period 2000–2018. Our estimated rate of WNA mass change for the
   early period (−2.9 ± 3.1 Gt yr^−1) is considerably less negative than
   the rate (−14 ± 3 Gt yr^−1) previously reported for the period
   2003–2009 (Gardner et al., 2013).

   In situ observations of SMB are invaluable given their temporal
   continuity and value in understanding climatic drivers of mass change
   (Hodge et al., 1998), but their use may bias regional estimates of mass
   change (Gardner et al., 2013). Our analysis (supporting information S1)
   shows that glaciological measurements of mass change are in broad
   agreement with geodetic estimates at the local scale, but they do not
   effectively sample large ice masses that dominate the regional signal
   of mass change from WNA, namely, large icefields in the southern Coast
   Mountains. Using available SMB measurements for 14 glaciers in WNA
   (supporting information S1), we calculate an average mass change of
   −874 ± 100 kg m^−2 yr^−1 over the period 2000–2017. When multiplied by
   the total glacierized area of WNA, this value yields an annual mass
   loss of 13.6 ± 4.3 Gt yr^−1, close to the value (14 ± 3 Gt yr^−1)
   calculated by Gardner et al. (2013) using a similar approach. These
   values are twice as large as those based on our trend analysis. This
   discrepancy suggests that glaciers chosen for long‐term monitoring
   programs are losing mass more rapidly than the region as a whole. Our
   findings accord with a study by Fountain et al. (2009), who concluded
   that South Cascade Glacier, chosen for long‐term in situ SMB
   observations, lost three times more mass than glaciers in the north
   Cascade Mountains (subregion 11 of Table 1).

   Cumulative mass loss from WNA glaciers over the period 2000–2018 could
   potentially account for 0.32 ± 11‐mm global sea level rise equivalent,
   about 0.6% of observed SLR over the period 1993–2017 (Nerem et al.,
   2018). Our estimate is an upper limit as it assumes that meltwater from
   glacier mass loss was directly conveyed to the ocean and not stored in
   intermediate locations (e.g., proglacial lakes formed over the last
   18 years). While surface storage of this water might be small, it could
   contribute to aquifer recharge (Liljedahl et al., 2017).

   One of the most surprising findings of our study is the dipole pattern
   of mass change between glaciers in the British Columbia central Coast
   [50–55°N] and the Cascade mountains [42–47°N] of the United States
   (Figure 1). Positive anomalies in zonal winds (250 hPa) over the
   Cascade Mountains imply a strengthening and southward shift in the jet
   stream between the early and late periods that would increase the
   frequency of mid‐latitude cyclones with attendant increases in
   precipitation. A change in meteorological conditions that favor changes
   in glacier mass are clearly revealed in the composite anomaly maps,
   especially for the central, southern Coast and Cascade glaciers
   (Figure 3). Glaciers of the southern Coast Mountains descend to lower
   elevations than those that flank high Cascade volcanoes. The
   partitioning of precipitation into either rain or snow may also explain
   why some of the Cascade glaciers gained mass during the recent period
   while Coast Mountain glaciers continued to experience strong thinning
   and mass loss. Future work employing surface mass and energy balance
   modeling at the glacier scale can be used to test this hypothesis.

   The spatial distribution of subregional mass change is partly linked to
   regional changes in atmospheric circulation that affect accumulation
   and ablation. Others have noted the importance of zonal wind on
   controlling glacier mass balance (Marshall et al., 2011; Shea &
   Marshall, 2007), and some studies attribute a decline in zonal wind
   strength to explain the long‐term (1950–2005) decline in winter snow
   water equivalent (Luce et al., 2013). In our study, anomalies in zonal
   wind covary with many of the meteorological fields known to control
   glacier mass balance, namely, temperature and precipitation.
   Orographically enhanced precipitation in WNA is also favored when
   strong zonal flow delivers moist air masses that originate over the
   Pacific Ocean (Jarosch et al., 2012; Neiman et al., 2008). Regions of
   weak zonal wind also coincide with lower‐than‐average geopotential
   height over last 18 years.

   It remains uncertain whether mass change observed over the last
   18 years is related to natural climate variability known to affect
   glacier mass balance in WNA (Bitz & Battisti, 1999; Hodge et al., 1998;
   Moore & Demuth, 2001), stochastic variability, or whether these recent
   changes are related to anthropogenic climate change. We note no obvious
   relation between major climate indices and decadal changes in zonal
   wind strength or pressure at the subregional scale (supporting
   information S1). Using an ensemble of 25 global climate models,
   however, Luce et al. (2013) show that under a high emission scenario
   (RCP8.5), zonal wind (700 hPa) strength significantly decreases over
   the Cascade and Coast Mountains by the end of this century. Zonal winds
   weaken most over the central and southern Coast Mountains (50–55°N) but
   strengthen over southern latitudes of California (Luce et al., 2013).
   Based on the results of our study, weaker zonal winds would tend to
   favor stronger mass loss for glaciers in the Cascade and Coast
   Mountains.

   Glaciers in both the CONUS and western Canada are expected to undergo
   continued mass loss throughout this century, even under moderate
   emission scenarios (Clarke et al., 2015; Frans et al., 2018; Huss &
   Hock, 2018). These changes will reduce or eliminate the thermal‐ and
   flow‐buffering capacity provided by glacier runoff for many watersheds,
   with implications for downstream ecosystems and water resources. If the
   last 18 years provide a suitable analogue for the next 30–50 years,
   future glacier change will be modulated by decadal‐scale climate
   variability. Like seasonal snow cover, improvement in understanding and
   forecasting climate variability at decadal time scales will be
   important to help guide estimates of glacier mass change for water
   management. Projections of future glacier mass change for both the
   CONUS (Frans et al., 2018) and western Canada (Clarke et al., 2015),
   like other regions, depend on well‐distributed observations of glacier
   area and mass change, and our results can be used to improve modeling
   efforts that seek to understand the fate of glaciers under future
   climate scenarios.

   Early results from Juno's mission at Jupiter including approach to
   Jupiter and the first perijove pass (PJ1).  Juno's scientific
   objectives include the study of Jupiter's interior, atmosphere and
   polar magnetosphere with the goal of understanding Jupiter's origin,
   formation and evolution.  This collection of papers provides early
   results from Juno's measurements of the gravity and magnetic fields,
   deep atmospheric microwave sounding, infrared, visible and ultraviolet
   images/spectra and an array of fields and particles instruments as well
   as context for the early results with respect to current theory and
   models of Jupiter's formation and evolution.  Topics include both Juno
   - Jupiter related theoretical models and data analysis as well as
   collaborative observations made from Earth based assets.

   Key Points

     * Uncertainty on Jupiter's low‐degree gravity moments due to
       differential rotation is larger than the Juno measurement
       uncertainty
     * This study provides the maximal possible contribution to J[2],
       J[4], J[6], and J[8] due to differential rotation
     * Most of Jupiter's internal models do not match Juno's gravity
       values, but accounting for differential rotation provides possible
       solutions

       evidence of large‐scale circulation down at least to the 50‐bar
       level
     * A narrow equatorial band is the only region where ammonia‐rich air
       from below the 50‐bar level can reach the ammonia cloud at 0.7 bars
     * At higher latitudes the ammonia‐rich air appears to be blocked by a
       layer of ammonia‐poor air between 3 and 15 bars

   Key Points

     * By monitoring of Jupiter with Hisaki and HST we discovered that
       dawn storm is followed by outer emission during transient aurora
     * The monitoring with Hisaki indicated hot electron injection in the
       plasma torus during the declining phase of the transient aurora
     * Energy for these disturbances is likely released via tail
       reconnection and transported to the plasma torus within a few
       Jupiter rotations

     * During compressions, the well‐defined sector of Jupiter's emission
       and the dusk poleward region brightened, the latter pulsating
     * The power emitted from the noon active region did not exhibit
       dependence on any interplanetary parameter, though the morphology
       changed

     * Magnetospheric compressions may enhance reconnection rates and
       increase mass transport across the magnetopause
     * Total pressure increases inside the magnetopause with durations of
       hours are indicative of strong solar wind‐magnetosphere energy
       transport

Featured Special Collection

   A Census of Atmospheric Variability from Seconds to Decades

   The atmosphere varies naturally on all length scales from millimeters
   to thousands of kilometers, and on all time scales from seconds to
   decades and longer.  This special collection of Geophysical Research
   Letters synthesizes and summarizes that variability through a
   phenomenological census.  The collection brings together some of the
   most influential and definitive papers to have been published in this
   journal in recent years.  The topics covered include turbulence on time
   scales of seconds and minutes, gravity waves on time scales of hours,
   weather systems on time scales of days, atmospheric blocking on time
   scales of weeks, the Madden–Julian Oscillation on time scales of
   months, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation
   on time scales of years, and the North Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic,
   Pacific Decadal, and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillations on time scales
   of decades.  The collection is accompanied by a Commentary article,
   which provides an authoritative, concise, and accessible point of
   reference for the most important modes of atmospheric variability.

Abstract

   The widespread volcanism on the Jovian moon Io is powered by tidal
   heating, yet we lack a deep understanding of how this distinctive
   heating process affects the locations, timing, or intensities of Io's
   eruptions. We show that the quasiperiodic behavior of the volcano Loki
   Patera in 1987–2018 matches the timescales for the evolution of Io's
   eccentricity and semimajor axis (~480 and ~460 days). If this orbital
   forcing is driving Loki Patera's variability, a low‐pass geophysical
   filter such as poroelastic flow, or a resonant amplification of Io's
   wobble, could account for the importance of these long‐period orbital
   variations despite their small amplitudes. The peak volcanic response
   is predicted to roughly coincide with Io's maximum eccentricity,
   consistent with the observations. High‐cadence observations over the
   next several years have the potential to conclusively discriminate
   between orbital versus geophysical control of Loki Patera's
   variability.

Plain Language Summary

   Tidal heating is one of the central processes that generates heat in
   the interiors of planets and moons and is in part responsible for the
   existence of subsurface oceans and geological activity on moons in the
   outer solar system. Under this process, the amount of heating that
   occurs, and the stresses in the crust, vary periodically with the
   periodic tidal flexing. As a result, we might expect that any
   geological activity powered by tidal heating, such as volcanic
   eruptions on Jupiter's tidally heated moon Io, would also vary
   periodically. Indeed, the water geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus vary
   in strength over the course of Enceladus' orbit around Saturn due to
   tides opening and closing fissures. Io takes only 1.77 days to orbit
   Jupiter, but its orbit is also slowly changing in time with a period of
   ~480 days. We compare the variability of Io's volcanoes with the
   evolution of its orbit and find that the quasiperiodic behavior of Loki
   Patera, the most powerful volcano on Io, follows a similar pattern as
   the orbital changes. We explore whether this volcano could be
   brightening and fading in response to changes in the heating and
   stresses produced by tides in its interior and what implications this
   has for the geophysical processes in Io's interior.
