Digit and Dian Fossey’s Historic Gorillas

   Tags: Cantsbee, dian fossey, Digit, Poppy

   The National Geographic Channel three-part series “Dian Fossey: Secrets
   in the Mist,” airing in December, covers many aspects of Fossey’s life
   and work, but none perhaps as poignant as her love for one gorilla in
   particular – silverback Digit.

   Fossey first saw Digit in 1967 when he was just a few years old. He
   belonged to one of the groups she decided to “habituate” to her
   presence and she ended up forming a special bond with him, giving him
   the name Digit when she noticed that one of his fingers was injured,
   probably from being caught in a poacher’s trap. Fossey described Digit
   as playful and curious as a youngster, as well as gentle and trusting
   even as he grew into a large silverback.  She called him her “beloved
   Digit.”
   Digit and Dian, May 1977

   When Digit was killed by poachers in 1977, Fossey’s grief was extreme.
   In his memory and to help raise funds for gorilla protection, she then
   founded the Digit Fund, which is today the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. In
   1985, after Fossey was murdered, her grave was placed next to Digit’s
   in the forest.

   Although the group Digit was in later disintegrated after a second
   poacher attack, Fossey closely observed many other gorillas who also
   became legendary as well, and today we still monitor many of their
   descendants. One of them, silverback Cantsbee, was seen and named by
   Dian Fossey when he was born in 1978 and lived until February 2017. In
   terms of offspring, group size, and length of dominance, Cantsbee was
   the most successful male mountain gorilla ever tracked and led the
   historic “Pablo” group for 21 years. Today, elderly female Poppy, now
   41 years old, is the last of the gorillas Fossey knew who is still
   alive. She is monitored by Fossey Fund trackers every day in her group.
   Poppy, 2016

   When Digit, Cantsbee, Poppy and the other gorillas Fossey observed were
   born, poaching was at some of its highest levels, motivating her to
   start funding anti-poaching patrols. As a result of this protection,
   which the Fossey Fund has dramatically increased and continued since
   Fossey’s death, the mountain gorilla population in the Virungas is
   double the size it was when Fossey was alive.

   To support our ongoing gorilla protection efforts, our award-winning
   gorilla trackers, and the ongoing legacy of Dian Fossey’s courageous
   work, please consider donating to the Fossey Fund  or even buying a
   symbolic “adoption” of gorilla Digit. You’ll become an important member
   of the gorilla team and add your name to conservation history. Click
   here to adopt Digit.

Helping People. Saving Gorillas.

   The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund is the largest and longest-running
   organization fully dedicated to gorilla conservation. No one knows
   gorillas like we do. Every day, we protect gorilla families, study how
   they live, and teach future scientists and local communities to do the
   same. Gorillas remain on the brink of extinction and without our
   continued efforts, their future is anything but secure, and neither is
   ours.

   There are many ways for you to help and we can’t do it without you!

Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund breaks ground on a new campus for gorilla

Gorilla Family Trees

   Gorillas live in groups with many of their relatives. We track all
   births and matriarchal lines and use DNA testing to determine paternity
   because adult males can mate with numerous females. See the results on
   our gorilla family tree! Learn More

   The Fossey Fund aims to set up a standardized long-term bird monitoring
   system in the VNP, following the notion that birds are reliable
   indicators of changes among terrestrial biodiversity and environmental
   conditions in the world. Dr. van der Hoek says "because birds respond
   more rapidly than large mammals do to the impacts of climate change.
   Studying birds helps us flag possible changes in the health of the
   ecosystems.”&NewLine;&NewLine;📸: Yntze van der Hoek
