Accedo

   “Pingdom is an important part of the tool suite that allows us to
   promise an service uptime close to 100%”

   View all case studies

   Industry
   Software

   Customer since
   2009

   Website
   www.accedo.tv

   Location
   Stockholm, Sweden

   Why pingdom?
   - Alerts
   - HTTP check
   - Multiple continents

App development for Smart/Connected TVs

   Accedo was founded ten years ago back in 2004, and today they have
   eleven offices and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. Accedo work
   with app development for Smart/Connected TVs. They have developed apps
   for customers like HBO, Spotify, Disney, MTV and Viaplay. With more
   than 1000 deployed applications on more than 40 different platforms
   reaching more than 100 million households, Accedo supports most of the
   application platforms on the market today.

A health check API for detailed control

   Fredrik Wallenius is the Head of IT & Operations at Accedo. “We have
   used Pingdom for many years. We needed a reliable and easy to configure
   way of monitoring the status of our systems” recalls Fredrik Wallenius.

   Since that first initial contact Accedo’s use of Pingdom have evolved
   and today it is part of the tools they use every day. “The custom HTTP
   check is a very clever feature. This allows us to build in a health
   check API in our services that can make a detailed control” says
   Wallenius.

   “Some of our most uptime critical services are not web sites but rather
   APIs. It can be complicated to judge if an API is fully operational by
   just calling one of the API calls. If you are (very) unlucky it can be
   so that only that API call is working but the rest of the service is
   down,” he says. In those cases Accedo often create a custom health
   check that resides “next to” the actual API and set up Pingdom to ping
   this health check.

   “What the health check does when receiving a request is that itself
   makes requests to several parts of the API we are monitoring and only
   return an OK if all parts respond as expected. That way we can be sure
   that all parts of the system is operational using only one Pingdom
   check.”

Monitor as much as possible

   One of Accedo’s biggest products is an App Store solution called Accedo
   Application Sphere used by several TV operators and manufacturers.
   There are millions of set-top-boxes and TVs throughout the world
   relying on that the API of this service is up in order to present their
   app content.

   “We have this service deployed on several locations around the globe
   and even the slightest downtime will affect many end-users so it is
   crucial that our operation teams get notified immediately in case of
   events,” says Wallenius.

   For their most important services and apps Accedo alert the operation
   team using both email, sms and phone by integrating with the Pagerduty
   service. During weekends when they have staff members on call the phone
   alert is the key to being able to keep the uptime they promise their
   customers.

   “But we also use Pingdom alerts for less critical systems, for example
   several staging environments. Here we only use mail alerts since even
   if an action is needed it may not have to be done within minutes,” says
   Fredrik Wallenius.

   Furthermore Accedo use the Pingdom reports as a basis for SLA
   follow-ups with several of their customers. “For these follow-ups it is
   important to have information from an unbiased and reliable source that
   both parties can trust,” he adds.

   “Monitor as much as possible! Things will break and you will want to
   notice this before your customers do. The customers can often
   understand that there are occasional events of downtime but they will
   not accept you not knowing about it and not being able to afterwards
   tell them exactly what happened and when it happened,” Fredrik
   Wallenius concludes.
