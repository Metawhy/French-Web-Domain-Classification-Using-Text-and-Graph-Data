   A dialysis technology certificate program prepares students with
   practical skills and necessary medical knowledge needed to work in the
   field. These programs may also ready students for professional
   certification exams, which are not required to work in the field, but
   do prove competency and could help with career advancement.
   Certificate programs provide participants with a foundation in kidney
   physiology and nephrological disease. Students will learn to ready
   patients for dialysis treatments, connect patients to dialysis
   machines, and monitor them during therapy time. They will also learn
   how to clean and disinfect dialyzers after each treatment for
   reuse.Dialysis Technician Certification Programs
   Certificate program participants take didactic courses and gain
   clinical skills through simulated lab experiences. Some programs also
   integrate a professional externship so students can gain first-hand
   abilities while learning about such concepts as:
   Patient care principles
   Sterilization and infection-prevention techniques
   Water treatment methods
   Anatomy of renal system
   Kidney failure signs

   Dialysis technicians, often referred to as patient care technicians
   (PCTs), follow strict protocols to guarantee safe and effective
   outcomes for patients undergoing this four-hour procedure. Their most
   important tasks are to monitor and adjust fluid removal rate according
   to patient vital signs and to minimize the possibility of infection
   through proper equipment handling and sterilization.

   Description

   Alternative medical diagnoses and treatments are not included as
   science-based treatments that are taught in medical schools, and are
   not used in medical practice where treatments are based on what is
   established using the scientific method. Alternative therapies lack
   such scientific validation, and their effectiveness is either unproved
   or disproved or impossible to prove.[n 8][1][14][21][22] Alternative
   medicine is usually based on religion, tradition, superstition, belief
   in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning,
   propaganda, or fraud.[1][2][3][14] Regulation and licensing of
   alternative medicine and health care providers varies from country to
   country, and state to state.

   Description

   Radiology is the science that uses medical imaging to diagnose and
   therefore treat diseases seen within the body.
   A variety of imaging techniques such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound,
   computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine including positron emission
   tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to
   diagnose and/or treat diseases. Interventional radiology is the
   performance of (usually minimally invasive) medical procedures with the
   guidance of imaging technologies.
   The acquisition of medical images is usually carried out by the
   radiographer, often known as a Radiologic Technologist. Depending on
   location, the Diagnostic Radiologist, or Reporting Radiographer, then
   interprets or "reads" the images and produces a report of their
   findings and impression or diagnosis. This report is then transmitted
   to the Clinician who requested the imaging. The report can initially be
   made as a "wet-read" which is a rapid preliminary response to a
   clinical question, which will generally followed later by a final
   report.[1] Medical images are stored digitally in the picture archiving
   and communication system (PACS) where they can be viewed by all members
   of the healthcare team within the same health system and compared later
   on with future imaging exams.
