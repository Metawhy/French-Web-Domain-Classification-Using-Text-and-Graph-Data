   Temperature is a measure of the warmth or coldness of an object or
   substance with reference to a standard value. It can be measured in
   Kelvin (K), Fahrenheit (F), or Celsius (C).
   Air in motion relative to the surface of the earth. Wind develops from
   pressure differences in the air. An area of high pressure and low
   pressure oppose each other and set up a pressure gradient force that
   moves from high to low pressure. This force creates a wind as air is
   pushed in the according direction. The stronger the pressure
   difference, the stronger the force, and the stronger the resultant
   wind. Wind is described as the prevailing direction of which the wind
   is blowing as a speed in units of miles per hour or knots.
   The force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere and gravity.
   Different units: atmospheres (atm), millibars (mb), pascals (Pa),
   inches of mercury (in), pounds per square inch (PSI), etc.
   Meteorologists most often use mb.
   The rain measured in a specified period of time (e.g. daily, monthly,
   yearly).
   That part of the electromagnetic spectrum between 5 - 400nm.
