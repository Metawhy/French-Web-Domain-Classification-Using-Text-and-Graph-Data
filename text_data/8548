   extramarital affair and its repercussions, the show uses the
   Rashomon effect to explore truths: Season one unfolded using the points
   of view of the adulterers—Noah (Dominic West) and Alison (Ruth Wilson).
   Season two continued the story but from the perspectives of their
   exes, Helen (Maura Tierney) and Cole (Joshua Jackson).

   Costume designer Caroline Duncan casts her nuanced eye over the show's
   shifting narrators with conflicting perspectives on the same story. How
   characters view one another and themselves varies and sometimes
   contradicts. Duncan makes sure the disparities are reflected in what
   the characters wear, making clothing a critical part of the narrative.

   The main characters in this show are either native New Yorkers or
   Montauk natives. How does the clothing they wear represent the two
   communities?

   When we are filming out in Montauk we try and put the characters who
   live there in pieces that feel weathered and have a lot of movement to
   them. As locals they aren’t incredibly wealthy and their clothing has a
   lived-in comfortable feel to it. We use a lot of natural fibers and
   very earthy colors. When we bring our city folks into the Montauk
   setting it’s a conscious choice, episode to episode, as to how much
   they stand apart from the local community. Are they armored up in their
   New York attire or are they easing into their environment?

   Where is it more difficult to work? Montauk or New York City?

   It’s so much harder to work in Montauk. Don’t get me wrong, I love it
   out there, but the conditions of shooting away from home are always
   challenging. When we are in Montauk we are on the beach a lot and
   that’s not easy. Anything, including clothing that has to get carried
   through the sand delays things. When we are in Brooklyn, should some
   problem arise it’s really easy to fix because you have all of your
   vendors at your disposal. If all of a sudden a scene changes and calls
   for a new type of costume that you don’t have on the wardrobe truck you
   can run to a store. When we shoot in Montauk it’s usually before or
   after the high season because we can’t compete with all of the tourism
   so the town is really quiet. That makes it easier to shoot but stores
   aren’t open, so you have to go to Montauk fully prepared for anything
   that could happen.

   Where do you shoot the most in Brooklyn?

   We were in Cobble Hill a lot during season one. Then that neighborhood
   became a hot zone because there were so many productions, so when we
   came back for season two the location manager was told that we weren’t
   allowed to film in the house we used for the Solloway’s residence. He
   found a house in Fort Greene with an exterior that was almost identical
   to the house in Cobble Hill, so we shot the home’s exterior shots there
   and the production designer built the home’s interior on a soundstage
   at Steiner Studios.

   The Solloway family resides in Park Slope. How did Brooklyn influence
   your sartorial decisions?

   The Solloways don’t live in Manhattan’s steeped, traditional wealth,
   but at the same time they are wealthy. Their children go to private
   schools and they live in a beautiful brownstone in Park Slope. So we
   buy clothing from a lot of the local stores like Area Kids for the
   younger children in the cast. We also go to Wolves Within and People of
   2Morrow on Franklin Street. and Rivet on Smith Street.

   Where would Noah Solloway shop in the city?

   In season one he’s not thinking about what he’s wearing so he’s going
   to the Gap or J.Crew—easy, comfortable, dad clothing. By season two
   he’s definitely going to Ralph Lauren, Barney’s and Bergdorf’s. We
   wanted to shift away from the smaller Brooklyn brands and the brands
   that feel approachable and get him dressing in clothes being sold at
   the smaller boutiques that are in his new neighborhood, Tribeca.

   In season one Alison Lockhart outfits differ dramatically depending on
   whose point of view we are seeing her from. Why?

   In the beginning of season one Alison is mourning the death of her
   child, so when we see her from her own point of view we put her in
   pieces that we wore down considerably. We tried to age her pieces and
   get the color out of them. Also everything was loose to make her feel
   like she was walking around with a shroud over her. But then from
   Noah’s point of view she’s in these skimpy little dresses, short shorts
   or a skirt. But she, of course, would never remember herself wearing
   those kinds of outfits.

   Alison moves from Montauk to TriBeCa. How did her wardrobe change?

   When she’s in TriBeCa we felt like Noah would have given her a spending
   budget so she would have the ability to go to more expensive stores.
   Smaller boutiques in Manhattan, no chains. Clothing is not important to
   her character. She wants to feel comfortable and disappear, so we felt
   like she would have beautiful pieces because she has nice taste, but
   nothing showy.

   Helen Solloway not only lives in Brooklyn, but she owns a small
   housewares store in Brooklyn. How did that affect your sartorial
   decisions when dressing Maura Tierney?

   Helen is a woman who grew up with privilege and wealth so she shops at
   department stores and high-end stores, but it was also really important
   for us that a lot of her wardrobe and jewelry come from local
   businesses in Brooklyn. My team and I walked up and down Atlantic
   Avenue and Court Street and went into every store prepping for the
   first season to find those special pieces that make her style feel so
   singular. Specifically we explored Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill and
   Williamsburg and shopped at stores like Catbird, Bird and Meg. The
   pieces we found in Brooklyn really make her feel like a chic Brooklyn
   mom.

   In the second season Helen's point of view becomes part of the
   storyline. Walk us through the ins and outs of that.

   We had to expand how we looked at her pieces. She’s going through a
   divorce and is a mess so we wanted her to look like she was never quite
   on the nose in her own point of view. Sometimes she’s living in her
   sweats and an oversized shirt that might have been Noah’s which has
   this depressing quality to it. Or we would put her in pieces that maybe
   she borrowed from her teenage daughter that are just a little too tight
   or too sheer. But from Noah’s point of view she’s always on the nose
   and from Alison’s point of view her clothing is incredibly understated,
   avant-garde—from special European brands found at Barney’s. That’s
   because Alison can’t relate to any part of Helen and is incredibly
   threatened by her. So when Alison is telling the story Helen is always
   in black and white and is a terrifying presence. In season two we get
   three completely different versions of Helen.

Liquid assets: Making bank on New York's water

   Errigo says his device can turn any town's water into the chemical twin
   of NYC's H2O.

   In a city with 1,660 pizzerias, there's a solid argument that the best
   is Denino's on Staten Island. Its pies scored a 4.5 rating in the
   latest Zagat survey, the same as Coney Island's legendary Totonno's and
   Lombardi's, the SoHo joint that claims to be America's first pizzeria.
   Denino's scored higher than Grimaldi's (4.1), the Brooklyn haunt that
   has opened 50 locations across the country in recent years and last
   month announced plans for five in the United Arab Emirates.

   But Mike Burke, stepson of founder Carlo Denino, has stuck close to
   home. He opened a Denino's in Brick, N.J., in 2010 and another in the
   West Village 18 months ago. He hasn't branched out farther, he said,
   because he believes his pizza requires an essential ingredient: New
   York City water.

   "When I used the water in Brick," Burke said, "the crust didn't come
   out right."

   For years, Burke, a retired city firefighter, trucked in blocks of city
   ice that he would melt to make his dough in New Jersey. But that all
   changed when he met Paul Errigo, a fellow Staten Islander and chief
   executive of a water-filtration company. Errigo, who is confident that
   the local water is what gives New York's pizza and bagels that certain
   something, set out to build a machine that would turn any
   municipality's H2O into l'eau de Gotham.

   "I thought he was joking," said Emmanuel Moya, a water-filtration
   engineer with several patents to his name whom Errigo first approached
   with his idea. After nine months and $1.1 million worth of research and
   development, Moya devised a machine that he says can filter, disinfect,
   descale, soften or harden any potable water until its molecular
   structure is identical to New York's.

   Since unveiling the New York WaterMaker last month at a Las Vegas trade
   show, Errigo has heard from big pizza chains, mom-and-pop pizzerias,
   microbreweries, bakeries and food manufacturers. He has orders for
   about 20 machines, which he licenses for $3,000 per year. He and his
   invention were guest stars on the CNBC reality show Staten Island
   Hustle.

   Errigo started working when he was 8 years old, making about $400 a
   week delivering the Staten Island Advance and the Daily News. After
   graduating from St. John's University with a bachelor's degree in
   marketing, he became a sales manager for an environmental services
   company before shifting gears and becoming a debt collector. He helped
   launch a firm that tracked down people who defaulted on car payments or
   health-club memberships. He sold that enterprise to his partners in
   2011 for a mid-seven-figure sum.

   He then shifted back to environmental products. And after years of
   flying across the country weekly to close one water deal or another, he
   said he thinks he might have hit his home run with New York WaterMaker.

   "It's revolutionary," he said. "Recipes of all kinds will taste better.
   Bread will be crispier, and pizza and bagels will be authentically New
   York because they will be made with water that is exactly the same as
   New Yorkers use."

   Armed with his new water machine, Burke is ready to take Denino's
   national.

   Errigo is riding some powerful consumer waves, starting with the fact
   that millions of Americans love Big Apple–style pizza. Nearly 800
   pizzerias across the country have "New York" in their name, making it
   the most common brand identifier in the industry, according to PMQ
   Pizza Magazine.

   New York water itself is held in high regard. Evangelists such as
   Errigo have helped spread that gospel, but so has City Hall. Mayor Bill
   de Blasio in December hailed the city's H2O as "some of the cleanest
   and best" in the world. Health Commissioner Mary Bassett dubbed it "the
   champagne of tap water." More recently, the city spent $81,000 on
   subway ads that display a bagel with the caption, "Yeah, it's the
   water."

   A Department of Environmental Protection spokesman said the ads are
   meant to comply with a federal requirement that the city promote its
   water-quality report. But the campaign coincides with long-running
   efforts to persuade locals to stop drinking from environmentally
   harmful plastic bottles and turn on the tap instead.
   Revenue stream

   Several businesses have scored big success off the idea that New York
   water is a difference-maker. Brooklyn Water Bagel launched in Florida
   in 2010 using what it describes as a proprietary water-treatment system
   that enables the company to "replicate the natural composition" of the
   Catskill Mountains water enjoyed by Brooklynites. The chain now has 25
   eateries around the country and generates an estimated $42 million in
   revenue, according to Restaurant Business magazine.

   New York's strength as a marketing mechanism dates back to at least the
   1920s, when Saks Fifth Avenue first opened stores in Chicago and Palm
   Beach, Fla. Nowadays the city's name is being used more than ever to
   sell bottled water. Original New York Seltzer, a popular brand in the
   1980s, was revived three years ago by a Los Angeles entrepreneur. Sales
   of competitor Hal's New York seltzer are doubling every year, said
   Chief Operating Officer Jerry Reda, and the Queens company is taking
   advantage of the momentum by broadening its product offerings beyond
   traditional lemon, lime and cherry with a coffee-flavored seltzer that
   launched in January.

   "It doesn't yellow the teeth like coffee does," Reda said, though with
   174 milligrams of caffeine per bottle—more than a Starbucks doppio
   espresso or even a Red Bull—it might cause them to rattle around.

   "New York is never on anyone's list of the cleanest cities, yet its
   water is revered," said Neil Kraft, founder of KraftWorks, a Manhattan
   design firm that helped make Norway's Voss water a hit by putting it in
   what looks like a perfume bottle. "It's absolutely insane."

   That said, the reputation of New York's water doesn't rest on marketing
   fluff alone. The city has spent $2.7 billion during the past 25 years
   to protect its watershed, and it is committed to spending $1 billion
   more in the next decade. As a result, the Catskill reservoirs and lakes
   that supply the city are considered so clean that New York is one of
   only five U.S. cities not required by regulators to filter the water
   supply. (The others are Boston; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and
   Seattle.)

   In addition to being clean, the city's water is low in calcium,
   chlorides and other minerals. It's also flavored with some magnesium,
   iron and traces of other compounds picked up in pipes and aqueducts,
   plus a pinch of road-salt runoff. Overall, the low mineral content
   makes the water soft and thus ideal for stiffening dough—which helps
   explain why New York's pizza crusts can handle a fistful of pepperoni
   without folding over and why its bagels are crispy outside and chewy
   inside.

Alchemy 101

   Paul Errigo is careful about revealing secrets behind his New York
   WaterMaker sauce. He will say that, unlike many of his fellow liquid
   alchemists, he doesn't rely on reverse osmosis, which involves removing
   all minerals and other chemical compounds from local water, then adding
   them back in just the right Big Apple proportions. Instead, Errigo's
   machine tweaks the existing supply's molecular makeup, such as by
   altering chlorine or calcium content, until it matches the New York
   vintage.

   But Errigo's quest to patent his contraption, which he hopes will be
   approved by March, could be difficult. There are hundreds of existing
   water-filtration and manipulation technologies, and Errigo's team will
   have to demonstrate that the WaterMaker represents an "inventive leap,"
   said Christopher Buccafusco, director of the intellectual-property
   program at the Cardozo School of Law. "This is a hard thing to patent,"
   Buccafusco said. — A.E.
   Legend in the making

   The idea that New York's pristine water is the secret behind its
   legendary pizza and bagels is undeniably a great story. Trouble is, it
   isn't true.

   Luis Belozerco, head of baking and food technical services at the
   American Institute of Baking, said there is simply no scientific basis
   to the claim that New York water makes food better. The taste of baked
   goods is affected by such variables as the type of flour and yeast used
   and the type and temperature of the oven, as well as the consumer's
   expectations and surroundings, Belozerco said.

   "I can make bagels or pizza with water from Manhattan, N.Y., or
   Manhattan, Kan.," he said. "Taste tests have shown people can't tell
   the difference."

   Paul Giannone, owner of Paulie Gee's, a Brooklyn pizzeria whose
   branches in Baltimore; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Miami all use tap
   water, said, "The pizza there comes out the same as here. This thing
   about New York water is an urban legend."

   Melanie Frost, COO of Ess-a-Bagel, says her aunt, who founded the
   business in the 1970s, put New York's water to the test by making
   bagels with London water. "She found no difference," Frost said. "She
   said it wasn't the water that was important; it was the recipe."

   Even so, Gotham's water has such a stellar reputation that Frost said
   she was interested in examining Errigo's machine, which might make it
   easier to open Ess-a-Bagel shops in Chicago and California.

   "It would be interesting to give this device a shot," she said. "What
   can we lose?"

   The notion that New York's water is somehow special dates back to the
   1950s, which happens to correspond with when pizza crossed over from a
   food eaten mostly by Italians to the mass market.

   At the time, the city's population was rising fast. To meet growing
   water demand, planners contemplated drawing from the Hudson River. That
   was stopped by outraged citizens, who rose up against sullying the
   Catskill and Croton supply networks, parts of which date to the 1840s.

   "I don't know if these opponents waxed rhapsodic about pizza or
   bagels," said David Soll, a professor at the University of
   Wisconsin–Eau Claire and author of Empire of Water, a history of New
   York's water system. "But that is when there was a lot of discussion
   about the city's high-quality water."

   As that water fight simmered, Denino's started selling pizza in 1951,
   28 years after it opened as a confectionery and later a tavern. Other
   standbys soon followed. Ray's Pizza opened in SoHo in 1959 and Ray's
   Real Italian Pizza on the East Side in 1964, according to Peter
   Genovese's book Pizza City. Quickly New York pizza—itself an adaptation
   of working-folk fare that originated in Naples, Italy, in the 18th
   century—conquered the country.

   Today 39% of all U.S. pizzerias think of themselves as making New
   York–style pizza, according to PMQ. The term has no strict definition,
   but broadly it's described as a hand-tossed, thin-crust pie topped with
   a light layer of tomato sauce and grated, full-fat mozzarella.

   Back in Brick, Burke said now that he can make New York water anywhere,
   he's looking to open more Denino's in New Jersey, Florida and maybe
   California. "We've got a whole lot of possibilities before us to reach
   new customers," he said.

   What awaits those customers is a classic New York pie with a superbly
   crunchy crust. But is it really as good in New Jersey as it is on
   Staten Island? Impossible to say. But nobody sitting around the table
   one recent afternoon in Brick was particularly concerned about that.

   "Man, this is good," Errigo said as he chomped on a slice topped with
   ricotta, mozzarella, olive oil and arugula. "In fact, it might even be
   better here than in New York."

   Scenes from The Affair

   In August, the cast and crew of The Affair will return to New York City
   and Montauk to film season three of the Showtime drama. About an
   extramarital affair and its repercussions, the show uses the
   Rashomon effect to explore truths: Season one unfolded using the points
   of view of the adulterers—Noah (Dominic West) and Alison (Ruth Wilson).
   Season two continued the story but from the perspectives of their
   exes, Helen (Maura Tierney) and Cole (Joshua Jackson).

   Costume designer Caroline Duncan casts her nuanced eye over the show's
   shifting narrators with conflicting perspectives on the same story. How
   characters view one another and themselves varies and sometimes
   contradicts. Duncan makes sure the disparities are reflected in what
   the characters wear, making clothing a critical part of the narrative.

   The main characters in this show are either native New Yorkers or
   Montauk natives. How does the clothing they wear represent the two
   communities?

   When we are filming out in Montauk we try and put the characters who
   live there in pieces that feel weathered and have a lot of movement to
   them. As locals they aren’t incredibly wealthy and their clothing has a
   lived-in comfortable feel to it. We use a lot of natural fibers and
   very earthy colors. When we bring our city folks into the Montauk
   setting it’s a conscious choice, episode to episode, as to how much
   they stand apart from the local community. Are they armored up in their
   New York attire or are they easing into their environment?

   Where is it more difficult to work? Montauk or New York City?

   It’s so much harder to work in Montauk. Don’t get me wrong, I love it
   out there, but the conditions of shooting away from home are always
   challenging. When we are in Montauk we are on the beach a lot and
   that’s not easy. Anything, including clothing that has to get carried
   through the sand delays things. When we are in Brooklyn, should some
   problem arise it’s really easy to fix because you have all of your
   vendors at your disposal. If all of a sudden a scene changes and calls
   for a new type of costume that you don’t have on the wardrobe truck you
   can run to a store. When we shoot in Montauk it’s usually before or
   after the high season because we can’t compete with all of the tourism
   so the town is really quiet. That makes it easier to shoot but stores
   aren’t open, so you have to go to Montauk fully prepared for anything
   that could happen.

   Where do you shoot the most in Brooklyn?

   We were in Cobble Hill a lot during season one. Then that neighborhood
   became a hot zone because there were so many productions, so when we
   came back for season two the location manager was told that we weren’t
   allowed to film in the house we used for the Solloway’s residence. He
   found a house in Fort Greene with an exterior that was almost identical
   to the house in Cobble Hill, so we shot the home’s exterior shots there
   and the production designer built the home’s interior on a soundstage
   at Steiner Studios.

   The Solloway family resides in Park Slope. How did Brooklyn influence
   your sartorial decisions?

   The Solloways don’t live in Manhattan’s steeped, traditional wealth,
   but at the same time they are wealthy. Their children go to private
   schools and they live in a beautiful brownstone in Park Slope. So we
   buy clothing from a lot of the local stores like Area Kids for the
   younger children in the cast. We also go to Wolves Within and People of
   2Morrow on Franklin Street. and Rivet on Smith Street.

   Where would Noah Solloway shop in the city?

   In season one he’s not thinking about what he’s wearing so he’s going
   to the Gap or J.Crew—easy, comfortable, dad clothing. By season two
   he’s definitely going to Ralph Lauren, Barney’s and Bergdorf’s. We
   wanted to shift away from the smaller Brooklyn brands and the brands
   that feel approachable and get him dressing in clothes being sold at
   the smaller boutiques that are in his new neighborhood, Tribeca.

   In season one Alison Lockhart outfits differ dramatically depending on
   whose point of view we are seeing her from. Why?

   In the beginning of season one Alison is mourning the death of her
   child, so when we see her from her own point of view we put her in
   pieces that we wore down considerably. We tried to age her pieces and
   get the color out of them. Also everything was loose to make her feel
   like she was walking around with a shroud over her. But then from
   Noah’s point of view she’s in these skimpy little dresses, short shorts
   or a skirt. But she, of course, would never remember herself wearing
   those kinds of outfits.

   Alison moves from Montauk to TriBeCa. How did her wardrobe change?

   When she’s in TriBeCa we felt like Noah would have given her a spending
   budget so she would have the ability to go to more expensive stores.
   Smaller boutiques in Manhattan, no chains. Clothing is not important to
   her character. She wants to feel comfortable and disappear, so we felt
   like she would have beautiful pieces because she has nice taste, but
   nothing showy.

   Helen Solloway not only lives in Brooklyn, but she owns a small
   housewares store in Brooklyn. How did that affect your sartorial
   decisions when dressing Maura Tierney?

   Helen is a woman who grew up with privilege and wealth so she shops at
   department stores and high-end stores, but it was also really important
   for us that a lot of her wardrobe and jewelry come from local
   businesses in Brooklyn. My team and I walked up and down Atlantic
   Avenue and Court Street and went into every store prepping for the
   first season to find those special pieces that make her style feel so
   singular. Specifically we explored Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill and
   Williamsburg and shopped at stores like Catbird, Bird and Meg. The
   pieces we found in Brooklyn really make her feel like a chic Brooklyn
   mom.

   In the second season Helen's point of view becomes part of the
   storyline. Walk us through the ins and outs of that.

   We had to expand how we looked at her pieces. She’s going through a
   divorce and is a mess so we wanted her to look like she was never quite
   on the nose in her own point of view. Sometimes she’s living in her
   sweats and an oversized shirt that might have been Noah’s which has
   this depressing quality to it. Or we would put her in pieces that maybe
   she borrowed from her teenage daughter that are just a little too tight
   or too sheer. But from Noah’s point of view she’s always on the nose
   and from Alison’s point of view her clothing is incredibly understated,
   avant-garde—from special European brands found at Barney’s. That’s
   because Alison can’t relate to any part of Helen and is incredibly
   threatened by her. So when Alison is telling the story Helen is always
   in black and white and is a terrifying presence. In season two we get
   three completely different versions of Helen.

Liquid assets: Making bank on New York's water

   Errigo says his device can turn any town's water into the chemical twin
   of NYC's H2O.

   In a city with 1,660 pizzerias, there's a solid argument that the best
   is Denino's on Staten Island. Its pies scored a 4.5 rating in the
   latest Zagat survey, the same as Coney Island's legendary Totonno's and
   Lombardi's, the SoHo joint that claims to be America's first pizzeria.
   Denino's scored higher than Grimaldi's (4.1), the Brooklyn haunt that
   has opened 50 locations across the country in recent years and last
   month announced plans for five in the United Arab Emirates.

   But Mike Burke, stepson of founder Carlo Denino, has stuck close to
   home. He opened a Denino's in Brick, N.J., in 2010 and another in the
   West Village 18 months ago. He hasn't branched out farther, he said,
   because he believes his pizza requires an essential ingredient: New
   York City water.

   "When I used the water in Brick," Burke said, "the crust didn't come
   out right."

   For years, Burke, a retired city firefighter, trucked in blocks of city
   ice that he would melt to make his dough in New Jersey. But that all
   changed when he met Paul Errigo, a fellow Staten Islander and chief
   executive of a water-filtration company. Errigo, who is confident that
   the local water is what gives New York's pizza and bagels that certain
   something, set out to build a machine that would turn any
   municipality's H2O into l'eau de Gotham.

   "I thought he was joking," said Emmanuel Moya, a water-filtration
   engineer with several patents to his name whom Errigo first approached
   with his idea. After nine months and $1.1 million worth of research and
   development, Moya devised a machine that he says can filter, disinfect,
   descale, soften or harden any potable water until its molecular
   structure is identical to New York's.

   Since unveiling the New York WaterMaker last month at a Las Vegas trade
   show, Errigo has heard from big pizza chains, mom-and-pop pizzerias,
   microbreweries, bakeries and food manufacturers. He has orders for
   about 20 machines, which he licenses for $3,000 per year. He and his
   invention were guest stars on the CNBC reality show Staten Island
   Hustle.

   Errigo started working when he was 8 years old, making about $400 a
   week delivering the Staten Island Advance and the Daily News. After
   graduating from St. John's University with a bachelor's degree in
   marketing, he became a sales manager for an environmental services
   company before shifting gears and becoming a debt collector. He helped
   launch a firm that tracked down people who defaulted on car payments or
   health-club memberships. He sold that enterprise to his partners in
   2011 for a mid-seven-figure sum.

   He then shifted back to environmental products. And after years of
   flying across the country weekly to close one water deal or another, he
   said he thinks he might have hit his home run with New York WaterMaker.

   "It's revolutionary," he said. "Recipes of all kinds will taste better.
   Bread will be crispier, and pizza and bagels will be authentically New
   York because they will be made with water that is exactly the same as
   New Yorkers use."

   Armed with his new water machine, Burke is ready to take Denino's
   national.

   Errigo is riding some powerful consumer waves, starting with the fact
   that millions of Americans love Big Apple–style pizza. Nearly 800
   pizzerias across the country have "New York" in their name, making it
   the most common brand identifier in the industry, according to PMQ
   Pizza Magazine.

   New York water itself is held in high regard. Evangelists such as
   Errigo have helped spread that gospel, but so has City Hall. Mayor Bill
   de Blasio in December hailed the city's H2O as "some of the cleanest
   and best" in the world. Health Commissioner Mary Bassett dubbed it "the
   champagne of tap water." More recently, the city spent $81,000 on
   subway ads that display a bagel with the caption, "Yeah, it's the
   water."

   A Department of Environmental Protection spokesman said the ads are
   meant to comply with a federal requirement that the city promote its
   water-quality report. But the campaign coincides with long-running
   efforts to persuade locals to stop drinking from environmentally
   harmful plastic bottles and turn on the tap instead.
   Revenue stream

   Several businesses have scored big success off the idea that New York
   water is a difference-maker. Brooklyn Water Bagel launched in Florida
   in 2010 using what it describes as a proprietary water-treatment system
   that enables the company to "replicate the natural composition" of the
   Catskill Mountains water enjoyed by Brooklynites. The chain now has 25
   eateries around the country and generates an estimated $42 million in
   revenue, according to Restaurant Business magazine.

   New York's strength as a marketing mechanism dates back to at least the
   1920s, when Saks Fifth Avenue first opened stores in Chicago and Palm
   Beach, Fla. Nowadays the city's name is being used more than ever to
   sell bottled water. Original New York Seltzer, a popular brand in the
   1980s, was revived three years ago by a Los Angeles entrepreneur. Sales
   of competitor Hal's New York seltzer are doubling every year, said
   Chief Operating Officer Jerry Reda, and the Queens company is taking
   advantage of the momentum by broadening its product offerings beyond
   traditional lemon, lime and cherry with a coffee-flavored seltzer that
   launched in January.

   "It doesn't yellow the teeth like coffee does," Reda said, though with
   174 milligrams of caffeine per bottle—more than a Starbucks doppio
   espresso or even a Red Bull—it might cause them to rattle around.

   "New York is never on anyone's list of the cleanest cities, yet its
   water is revered," said Neil Kraft, founder of KraftWorks, a Manhattan
   design firm that helped make Norway's Voss water a hit by putting it in
   what looks like a perfume bottle. "It's absolutely insane."

   That said, the reputation of New York's water doesn't rest on marketing
   fluff alone. The city has spent $2.7 billion during the past 25 years
   to protect its watershed, and it is committed to spending $1 billion
   more in the next decade. As a result, the Catskill reservoirs and lakes
   that supply the city are considered so clean that New York is one of
   only five U.S. cities not required by regulators to filter the water
   supply. (The others are Boston; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and
   Seattle.)

   In addition to being clean, the city's water is low in calcium,
   chlorides and other minerals. It's also flavored with some magnesium,
   iron and traces of other compounds picked up in pipes and aqueducts,
   plus a pinch of road-salt runoff. Overall, the low mineral content
   makes the water soft and thus ideal for stiffening dough—which helps
   explain why New York's pizza crusts can handle a fistful of pepperoni
   without folding over and why its bagels are crispy outside and chewy
   inside.

Alchemy 101

   Paul Errigo is careful about revealing secrets behind his New York
   WaterMaker sauce. He will say that, unlike many of his fellow liquid
   alchemists, he doesn't rely on reverse osmosis, which involves removing
   all minerals and other chemical compounds from local water, then adding
   them back in just the right Big Apple proportions. Instead, Errigo's
   machine tweaks the existing supply's molecular makeup, such as by
   altering chlorine or calcium content, until it matches the New York
   vintage.

   But Errigo's quest to patent his contraption, which he hopes will be
   approved by March, could be difficult. There are hundreds of existing
   water-filtration and manipulation technologies, and Errigo's team will
   have to demonstrate that the WaterMaker represents an "inventive leap,"
   said Christopher Buccafusco, director of the intellectual-property
   program at the Cardozo School of Law. "This is a hard thing to patent,"
   Buccafusco said. — A.E.
   Legend in the making

   The idea that New York's pristine water is the secret behind its
   legendary pizza and bagels is undeniably a great story. Trouble is, it
   isn't true.

   Luis Belozerco, head of baking and food technical services at the
   American Institute of Baking, said there is simply no scientific basis
   to the claim that New York water makes food better. The taste of baked
   goods is affected by such variables as the type of flour and yeast used
   and the type and temperature of the oven, as well as the consumer's
   expectations and surroundings, Belozerco said.

   "I can make bagels or pizza with water from Manhattan, N.Y., or
   Manhattan, Kan.," he said. "Taste tests have shown people can't tell
   the difference."

   Paul Giannone, owner of Paulie Gee's, a Brooklyn pizzeria whose
   branches in Baltimore; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Miami all use tap
   water, said, "The pizza there comes out the same as here. This thing
   about New York water is an urban legend."

   Melanie Frost, COO of Ess-a-Bagel, says her aunt, who founded the
   business in the 1970s, put New York's water to the test by making
   bagels with London water. "She found no difference," Frost said. "She
   said it wasn't the water that was important; it was the recipe."

   Even so, Gotham's water has such a stellar reputation that Frost said
   she was interested in examining Errigo's machine, which might make it
   easier to open Ess-a-Bagel shops in Chicago and California.

   "It would be interesting to give this device a shot," she said. "What
   can we lose?"

   The notion that New York's water is somehow special dates back to the
   1950s, which happens to correspond with when pizza crossed over from a
   food eaten mostly by Italians to the mass market.

   At the time, the city's population was rising fast. To meet growing
   water demand, planners contemplated drawing from the Hudson River. That
   was stopped by outraged citizens, who rose up against sullying the
   Catskill and Croton supply networks, parts of which date to the 1840s.

   "I don't know if these opponents waxed rhapsodic about pizza or
   bagels," said David Soll, a professor at the University of
   Wisconsin–Eau Claire and author of Empire of Water, a history of New
   York's water system. "But that is when there was a lot of discussion
   about the city's high-quality water."

   As that water fight simmered, Denino's started selling pizza in 1951,
   28 years after it opened as a confectionery and later a tavern. Other
   standbys soon followed. Ray's Pizza opened in SoHo in 1959 and Ray's
   Real Italian Pizza on the East Side in 1964, according to Peter
   Genovese's book Pizza City. Quickly New York pizza—itself an adaptation
   of working-folk fare that originated in Naples, Italy, in the 18th
   century—conquered the country.

   Today 39% of all U.S. pizzerias think of themselves as making New
   York–style pizza, according to PMQ. The term has no strict definition,
   but broadly it's described as a hand-tossed, thin-crust pie topped with
   a light layer of tomato sauce and grated, full-fat mozzarella.

   Back in Brick, Burke said now that he can make New York water anywhere,
   he's looking to open more Denino's in New Jersey, Florida and maybe
   California. "We've got a whole lot of possibilities before us to reach
   new customers," he said.

   What awaits those customers is a classic New York pie with a superbly
   crunchy crust. But is it really as good in New Jersey as it is on
   Staten Island? Impossible to say. But nobody sitting around the table
   one recent afternoon in Brick was particularly concerned about that.

   "Man, this is good," Errigo said as he chomped on a slice topped with
   ricotta, mozzarella, olive oil and arugula. "In fact, it might even be
   better here than in New York."
