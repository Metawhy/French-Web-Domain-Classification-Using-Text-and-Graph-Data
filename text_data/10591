   Oral contraceptives for family planning worldwide have revolutionized
   the reproductive lives of millions of women since their introduction in
   the 1960s. Later on, a variety of side-effects including cardiovascular
   diseases was recognized. In response to these concerns, new generations
   of combined oral contraceptives were developed that featured lower dose
   of estrogen and newer, more potent progestogens. The effectiveness and
   ease of use of combined hormonal contraceptives suggest that they will
   continue to be used to a significant extent in the future. This
   ninety-first volume of IARC Monographs contains evaluations of the
   carcinogenic hazard to humans of combined estrogen-progestogen
   contraceptives and combined estrogen-protestogen menopausal therapy.
   The hormonal drugs reviewed in this volume involve co-administration of
   an estrogen and a progestogen. Studies that did not provide information
   on the use of combined estrogen-progestogen agents are not reviewed. It
   should also be noted that this volume reviews only studies that are
   publicly available and therefore does not include pharmaceutical test
   results that are not in the public domain. The evaluations developed in
   this volume identify specific forms of cancer for which the risk is
   increased or decreased by combined estrogen-progestogen contraceptives
   and provide information that will help address the health concerns and
   well-being of hundred of millions of women worldwide.

   ***This book was highly commended in the Public Health category of the
   British Medical Association's 2013 annual Medical Book Competition.***

   Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs, A Review of Human Carcinogens,
   covers all agents previously classified by IARC as "carcinogenic to
   humans (Group 1)" and was developed by six separate Working Groups:
   Pharmaceuticals; Biological agents; Arsenic, Metals, Fibres, and Dusts;
   Radiation; Personal Habits and Indoor Combustions; Chemical Agents and
   Related Occupations. This Volume 100B covers Biological Agents,
   specifically Epstein-Barr Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus,
   Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, Human
   Papillomaviruses, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1, Opisthorchis
   Viverrini and Clonorchis Sinensis, Schistosoma Haematobium, and
   Helicobacter Pylori.

   Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs are focused
   on key information. Each Monograph presents a description of a
   carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical overviews of
   the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise
   review of the agent's toxicokinetics, plausible mechanisms of
   carcinogenesis, and potentially susceptible populations, and
   life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual
   epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in
   tables. Short tables that highlight key results are printed in Volume
   100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear on the
   Monographs programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).

   It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated
   through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer
   prevention activities worldwide, and will be a valued resource for
   future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer in
   humans.

   Presents the results of an expert evaluation of the carcinogenic risk
   to humans posed by infection with two lymphotropic herpesviruses:
   Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus
   8, a new human herpesvirus detected in 1994 in Kaposi's sarcoma
   associated with AIDS. The viruses are evaluated in separate monographs,
   which consider the biology of the virus, the epidemiology of
   infections, related animal viruses, and mechanistic studies, in
   addition to abundant studies of cancer in humans.

   Oral contraceptives for family planning worldwide have revolutionized
   the reproductive lives of millions of women since their introduction in
   the 1960s. Later on, a variety of side-effects including cardiovascular
   diseases was recognized. In response to these concerns, new generations
   of combined oral contraceptives were developed that featured lower dose
   of estrogen and newer, more potent progestogens. The effectiveness and
   ease of use of combined hormonal contraceptives suggest that they will
   continue to be used to a significant extent in the future. This
   ninety-first volume of IARC Monographs contains evaluations of the
   carcinogenic hazard to humans of combined estrogen-progestogen
   contraceptives and combined estrogen-protestogen menopausal therapy.
   The hormonal drugs reviewed in this volume involve co-administration of
   an estrogen and a progestogen. Studies that did not provide information
   on the use of combined estrogen-progestogen agents are not reviewed. It
   should also be noted that this volume reviews only studies that are
   publicly available and therefore does not include pharmaceutical test
   results that are not in the public domain. The evaluations developed in
   this volume identify specific forms of cancer for which the risk is
   increased or decreased by combined estrogen-progestogen contraceptives
   and provide information that will help address the health concerns and
   well-being of hundred of millions of women worldwide.

   ***This book was highly commended in the Public Health category of the
   British Medical Association's 2013 annual Medical Book Competition.***

   Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs, A Review of Human Carcinogens,
   covers all agents previously classified by IARC as "carcinogenic to
   humans (Group 1)" and was developed by six separate Working Groups:
   Pharmaceuticals; Biological agents; Arsenic, Metals, Fibres, and Dusts;
   Radiation; Personal Habits and Indoor Combustions; Chemical Agents and
   Related Occupations. This Volume 100B covers Biological Agents,
   specifically Epstein-Barr Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus,
   Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, Human
   Papillomaviruses, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1, Opisthorchis
   Viverrini and Clonorchis Sinensis, Schistosoma Haematobium, and
   Helicobacter Pylori.

   Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs are focused
   on key information. Each Monograph presents a description of a
   carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical overviews of
   the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise
   review of the agent's toxicokinetics, plausible mechanisms of
   carcinogenesis, and potentially susceptible populations, and
   life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual
   epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in
   tables. Short tables that highlight key results are printed in Volume
   100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear on the
   Monographs programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).

   It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated
   through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer
   prevention activities worldwide, and will be a valued resource for
   future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer in
   humans.

   This ninetieth volume of the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of
   Carcinogenic Risks to Humans considers human papillomaviruses (HPVs),
   which were evaluated by a previous Working Group (IARC, 1995). The
   monograph in the present volume incorporates new data that have become
   available during the past decade. HPVs represent the most common
   infectious agents that are transmitted sexually throughout the world;
   the major risk factors are behaviours associated with sexual activity.
   Although most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared within a
   period of 2 years, genital HPV infection can lead to clinical disease,
   including anogenital warts, cervical neoplasia, cervical cancer and
   other anogenital cancers. The risk for persistence of infection and
   progression of the more than 40 genital HPV types to grade 3 cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) and cancer differs widely. Persistent
   infection with carcinogenic HPVs occurs in virtually all cases of
   cervical cancer. Previous evaluations of HPVs have classified types 16
   and 18 as carcinogenic to humans (group 1), types 31 and 33 as probably
   carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) and some types other than 16, 18, 31
   and 33 as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). At that time, the
   evaluation of types 16 and 18 was based on the strong association
   between infection with these HPVs and cervical cancer. For types 31 and
   33, the association was less strong. The new epidemiological data
   reviewed in the present volume strongly support and further confirm the
   previous evaluation of types 16 and 18, and provide new evidence for
   other HPVs. This information, which includes strong evidence of
   carcinogenicity at sites other than the cervix, supports new
   evaluations for several other HPV types in addition to those mentioned
   above. Since the Working Group was convened in 2005, important
   innovations in HPV prophylaxis have occurred and these needed to be
   included in this volume. To date two prophylactic vaccines have been
   developed and used in large multicentric trials. This prophylactic
   vaccination is expected to reduce the incidence of HPV-related genital
   diseases. However, the benefits of prophylactic vaccines in a broad
   public health perspective will be achieved only if such vaccines can be
   provided to those groups of women for whom access to cervical cancer
   screening services is most problematic. Therefore, the development of
   second-generation vaccines that are expected to be cheaper, easier to
   deliver and/or to provide T-cell response against pre-existing HPV
   infections is highly desirable.

   Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs, A Review of Human Carcinogens,
   covers all agents previously classified by IARC as "carcinogenic to
   humans (Group 1)" and was developed by six separate Working Groups:
   Pharmaceuticals; Biological agents; Arsenic, Metals, Fibres, and Dusts;
   Radiation; Personal Habits and Indoor Combustions; Chemical Agents and
   Related Occupations. This Volume 100C covers Arsenic, Metals, Fibres,
   and Dusts, specifically Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds, Beryllium and
   Beryllium Compounds, Cadmium and Cadmium Compounds, Chromium (VI)
   Compounds, Nickel and Nickel Compounds, Asbestos (Chrysotile, Amosite,
   Crocidolite, Tremolite, Actinolite and Anthophyllite), Erionite,
   Leather Dust, Silica Dust, Crystalline, in the form of Quartz or
   Cristobalite, and Wood Dust.

   Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs are focused
   on key information. Each Monograph presents a description of a
   carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical overviews of
   the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise
   review of the agent's toxicokinetics, plausible mechanisms of
   carcinogenesis, and potentially susceptible populations, and
   life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual
   epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in
   tables. Short tables that highlight key results are printed in Volume
   100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear on the
   Monographs programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).

   It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated
   through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer
   prevention activities worldwide, and will be a valued resource for
   future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer in
   humans.

     * About this book
     * Table of contents

   Evaluates the carcinogenic risk to humans posed by the consumption of
   chlorinated drinking-water, by two chemicals used in the chlorination
   of drinking-water, by a number of halogenated by-products formed when
   chlorine interacts with organic matter in water, and by a selection of
   other halogenated compounds found in drinking-water. Chlorination was
   selected for evaluation because of its widespread use and because
   potentially carcinogenic by-products have been measured in chlorinated
   water. The book also includes a separate monograph on cobalt and cobalt
   compounds. The volume opens with a discussion of the many
   methodological problems that complicate efforts to assess the
   carcinogenicity of chlorinated water. Against this background, the book
   evaluates the design and findings of all studies relevant to the
   carcinogenicity assessment of chlorinated drinking-water, two chemicals
   (sodium chlorite and hypochlorite salts) used in the chlorination of
   water, eight of the by-products most frequently measured in
   drinking-water, and three additional halogenated chemicals detected in
   drinking-water. Because of the formidable methodological obstacles
   faced by all investigations, only one of these substances could be
   classified: bromodichloromethane was classified as possibly
   carcinogenic to humans. The final monograph considers data on metallic
   cobalt, cobalt alloys, including cobalt-containing surgical implants
   and dental devices, and cobalt compounds. In view of the strength of
   evidence linking cobalt metal powder and cobalt[II] oxide to cancer in
   experimental animals, cobalt and cobalt compounds were classified as
   possibly carcinogenic to humans.

     * About this book
     * Table of contents

   This monograph evaluates the evidence of carcinogenicity of metallic
   cobalt particles with or without tungsten carbide, to which workers in
   the hard-metal industry are exposed, and of cobalt sulfate and other
   soluble cobalt (II) salts. It also evaluates three other particulate
   compounds: gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, which are used
   extensively in the microelectronics industry; and vanadium pentoxide, a
   contaminant at facilities refining and processing vanadium-rich ores
   and in various workplaces that use oil-fired boilers and furnaces.
