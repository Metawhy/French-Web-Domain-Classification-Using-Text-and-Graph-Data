   (1) "My International Accounts" service in your online space. For HSBC
   France, the accounts eligible for "My international transfers" are
   deposit accounts denominated in euros.

   We remind you that according to the regulations in force, individuals,
   associations, and companies not having the commercial form, domiciled
   or established for tax purposes in France, are required to declare,
   when declaring their income or results, the accounts opened, held, used
   or closed abroad as well as the related income. In addition, as soon as
   individuals receive income from movable property through these
   accounts, they must pay social security contributions and, where
   applicable, a down payment of income tax. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the representative value of real estate
   assets of shares or shares in companies or organisations held in these
   accounts must be declared for tax purposes if the holders concerned are
   liable for it. In addition, under current regulations, individuals
   domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to declare, when
   filing their income tax returns, certain information relating to
   capitalisation contracts and investments of the same nature, and in
   particular life insurance contracts, taken out with organisations
   established outside France and, where applicable, the income generated
   on these contracts when they are fully or partially surrendered. In
   addition, the latter must also pay the social security contributions
   due under their contract. Finally, the surrender value of surrenderable
   insurance contracts and capitalisation warrants or contracts up to the
   fraction of their representative value of units of account composed of
   taxable real estate assets must be declared for tax purposes if the
   holders concerned are liable for it. In the event of non-compliance
   with these obligations, the persons concerned are exposed to tax
   reminders and the application of sanctions. For further details
   regarding your reporting and tax obligations, we recommend that you
   consult an independent adviser.

   (2) Fees may nevertheless be charged by the local bank in some
   countries.

   (3) Except on public holidays.

   (4) Up to USD 100,000 (or its equivalent).

   (5) Lingua Custodia offers any individual the opportunity to try its
   online translation service (beta version) free of charge for 3 months,

   employment insurance contracts. HSBC offers you simplified and faster
   access to this service as part of an offer reserved for any adult
   individual capable, excluding students, of opening their first account
   with HSBC France before 30 September 2019. The simplified access link
   will be sent after the account has been opened and will allow access to
   Lingua Custodia's translation service for 3 months under the above
   conditions. Offer limited to the first 1000 new customers. Offer can be
   combined with other current offers, limited to one access per person or
   per tax household in the event of opening a joint bank account. The
   terms and conditions of the translation service are those of the
   General Terms and Conditions signed directly between the client and

   (1) "My International Accounts" service in your online space. For HSBC
   France, the accounts eligible for "My international transfers" are
   deposit accounts denominated in euros.

   We remind you that according to the regulations in force, individuals,
   associations, and companies not having the commercial form, domiciled
   or established for tax purposes in France, are required to declare,
   when declaring their income or results, the accounts opened, held, used
   or closed abroad as well as the related income. In addition, as soon as
   individuals receive income from movable property through these
   accounts, they must pay social security contributions and, where
   applicable, a down payment of income tax. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the representative value of real estate
   assets of shares or shares in companies or organisations held in these
   accounts must be declared for tax purposes if the holders concerned are
   liable for it. In addition, under current regulations, individuals
   domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to declare, when
   filing their income tax returns, certain information relating to
   capitalisation contracts and investments of the same nature, and in
   particular life insurance contracts, taken out with organisations
   established outside France and, where applicable, the income generated
   on these contracts when they are fully or partially surrendered. In
   addition, the latter must also pay the social security contributions
   due under their contract. Finally, the surrender value of surrenderable
   insurance contracts and capitalisation warrants or contracts up to the
   fraction of their representative value of units of account composed of
   taxable real estate assets must be declared for tax purposes if the
   holders concerned are liable for it. In the event of non-compliance
   with these obligations, the persons concerned are exposed to tax
   reminders and the application of sanctions. For further details
   regarding your reporting and tax obligations, we recommend that you
   consult an independent adviser.

   (2) Fees may nevertheless be charged by the local bank in some
   countries.

   (4) We would like to remind you that, under current French regulations,
   individuals, associations and non-commercial companies domiciled or
   established for tax purposes in France are required to declare accounts
   used, opened or closed abroad and the related income in their personal
   or corporate income tax return. Moreover, as soon as tax is paid on
   investment income, individuals must pay social contributions and, where
   applicable, make interim tax payments. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the value represented by real estate assets
   or shares of corporations or organisations held in these accounts must
   be declared for property wealth tax purposes if the holders concerned
   are liable to this tax. Moreover, under current regulations,
   individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to
   include details in their tax return of capitalisation contracts and
   similar investments, particularly life insurance policies, underwritten
   by organisations established outside France and, where appropriate, any

More details on the PEA

What is the PEA ?

   Le Plan d'Epargne en Actions (PEA or shared savings plan) is a
   tax-privileged plan that allows you to invest and manage a portfolio of
   eligible French and European securities (eg. shares, units of certain
   UCIs, etc.) while taking advantage of an attractive taxation framework.

   The PEA consists of a Securities Account and a cash account intended to
   receive your payments, proceeds from the sale of securities or
   dividends, and other products while awaiting their investment.

   The shares of UCIs established in a Member State of the European
   Community as well as in Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein, "coordinated"
   within the meaning of the European regulations and whose assets are
   permanently composed of a minimum of 75% of securities are eligible for
   the PEA.

   Note: Since March 20, 2012, the transfer from France of the fiscal
   domicile of the holder of a PEA no longer automatically entails the
   closing of the plan, except if this transfer takes place in an ETNC
   within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the CGI.

   An exemption from income tax from 5 years of detention^(1).


An answer to each objective

     * Build or foster long-term capital. Do you want to invest a portion
       of your savings in the stock market while benefiting from a tax
       exemption on your income and your capital gains? The PEA allows you
       to make payments in cash up to € 150,000 per person, €300,000 for a
       married couple or civil partnerships ^(2). You benefit, from 5
       years of detention, a privileged tax regime ^(1) that allows you to
       enjoy the fruits of your savings!
     * The Equity Savings Plan works like a traditional securities account
       and allows you to invest as you wish in European markets. You
       manage your own portfolio and invest in the European financial
       markets (shares, units of certain UCIs, etc.).
     * Prepare for retirement by securing additional income that is exempt
       from income tax

   In addition to traditional savings with the Stock Savings Plan. After 8
   years in custody, you can close your PEA and convert your capital into
   a life annuity exempt from income tax. You thus ensure regular income
   for your retirement, without taxation, with the exception of applicable
   social security contributions (except for non-French tax residents).

   (2) Only one PEA/PEA PME can be opened per person, two for a
   married/civil partnership couple subject to a common taxation for all
   establishments combined. People who are fiscally dependent on a
   taxpayer cannot open a PEA. Deposit capped at 150,000 Euros by PEA. The
   opening of a PEA is reserved for natural persons having their fiscal
   domicile in France and their detention to natural persons having their
   fiscal domicile outside a State and Non-Cooperative Territory (ETNC).

   provided they are large enough and offer a range of "in-house" funds,
   ie. from at least 70% of a single management company.

   We remind you that according to the regulations in force, individuals,
   associations, and companies not having the commercial form, domiciled
   or established for tax purposes in France, are required to declare,
   when declaring their income or results, the accounts opened, held, used
   or closed abroad as well as the related income. In addition, as soon as
   individuals receive income from movable property through these
   accounts, they must pay social security contributions and, where
   applicable, a down payment of income tax. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the representative value of real estate
   assets of shares or shares in companies or organisations held in these
   accounts must be declared for tax purposes if the holders concerned are
   liable for it. In addition, under current regulations, individuals
   domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to declare, when
   filing their income tax returns, certain information relating to
   capitalisation contracts and investments of the same nature, and in
   particular life insurance contracts, taken out with organisations
   established outside France and, where applicable, the income generated
   on these contracts when they are fully or partially surrendered. In
   addition, the latter must also pay the social security contributions
   due under their contract. Finally, the surrender value of surrenderable
   insurance contracts and capitalisation warrants or contracts up to the
   fraction of their representative value of units of account composed of
   taxable real estate assets must be declared for tax purposes if the
   holders concerned are liable for it. In the event of non-compliance
   with these obligations, the persons concerned are exposed to tax
   reminders and the application of sanctions. For further details
   regarding your reporting and tax obligations, we recommend that you
   consult an independent adviser.
