An update on a Wednesday

   I hope you are enjoying the new year! I have been spending time with
   these three yahoos lately.

   Drakeajallliesilly
   Nuts...that's all they are. The boys have started back to school, and
   my daughter leaves to go back to school soon. Waaa...I'll sure miss
   that smile and our "girl power" around here.

   IMG_4900

   When they aren't around, I've been prepping for Letter Whimsy
   E-Workshop! I am soooo looking forward to this Course.

   I want to play, to create, to stretch the limits...make cool schtuffs
   and to inspire others to do the same! It's time, too. I can feel it. I
   love being a mom oh yes I do, but I also love to create. I create to be
   a complete person. That's how I'm wired.

   Letterwhimsy1165

   Lots of folks have signed ...THANK YOU so much! It's going to be a
   great course. I'm so ready to create! Letter Whimsy starts Monday, Jan.
   9!

Wrapping up this year

   Before I put 2011 to sleep for good, I just had to share what landed on
   my door step yesterday. I recently participated in a fun Stocking Swap
   with several talented ladies, hostessed by Carrie Harney. She went to a
   lot of work..there was a large group of girls in this swap.

   My sweet swap partner had to back out at the last minute, so Carrie
   stepped in and treated me to all of this. So sweet!


   2011-12-31_09-21-50_385
   She made the journal (so great), and I gotta say I love the goodies she
   added. Thanks Carrie!! Here is a photo of the stocking I did for my
   partner, Carrie Harney.

   She wanted a white Christmas...so I made her stocking with vintage
   Irish linens and doilies.

   I hope you have a very Happy New Year and enjoy the merriment of the
   season! I got my Copic fix this morning and lettered then colored this
   New Year's wish for you...

Hey, wanna letter better?

   Art journaling and doodley doos have slowly been coming back to life
   for me now that the holidays have past. By the way, we had a great
   Christmas weekend, hope you did too! Some great family time which I was
   so looking forward to. Even craved it I think.

   I've been able to carve out some creative time now, and oh how I've
   missed that. I'm sure you can relate. Here's a peek what I have been up
   to:

   Letterwhimsy4
   I'm gearing up for a FABULOUS new E-Workshop! Can't wait! If you love
   art journals, and pretty hand lettering, you will love this new course.

   Letterwhimsylogo
   I've been wanting to devote a whole course to lettering for forever.
   I'm really excited about it, and looking forward to sharing it. It's
   the perfect way to start the new year!

   Letter Whimsy starts January 9th. There are only a few supplies you
   will need...so yay to that, right? Definitely.

   Get the details here!

Two More Sleeps 'Til Christmas

   Can you believe it? The big day is almost here! Are you ready? I'm
   close...so close. One of the biggest things at our house is the food.
   I've made a menu to share with you. I'm sure you have your own, and
   like ours, it's full of traditions.


   Menu

   The brownies are my hubby's grandma's and they are so fabulous. The
   peanut butter balls are my Mom's and we are already on our 3rd batch of
   them. Crazy teens. The chili on Christmas Eve is a tradition, so is the
   strata and ham.

   Anyway, as you can see I have lots of baking and prepping in front of
   me. Before I go I just wanted to wish all of you dear readers a very
   Merry Christmas! I hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend with those
   you love! xoxo

Chessheads

   The past few months the guys have been really into playing chess. They
   are pretty serious about it, too.

   _MG_4729

   I don't play chess, I just like to take pictures of it all...

   _MG_4766
   _MG_4735
   _MG_4725
   _MG_4751
   _MG_4758

   The Chess King in the house (our almost 18 year old) has been coaching
   our 13 year old. Too cute. They are mighty serious about it. They
   entered a tournament this past weekend and Mr. 13 year old got 3rd
   place in his age group!

   I tried to get a good shot of him with his trophy, but that didn't work
   out.

   2011-12-17_11-33-55_980

   I got this one of him telling me all about it though...

   2011-12-17_11-33-19_342
   He is not really a "sit still and strategize" kinda guy...so this was
   an experience for him I am sure. I'm glad he did so well though! I'm
   know that the boys and Daddio will be playing lots of chess over
   Christmas break!

Catching Up

   Where did the week go? I feel like I've neglected my blog this week. My
   only excuse is that I was busy finishing up the 12 Days E-Workshop, and
   then my daugher came home from school..yay!

   I thought I'd post a few art journal pages. I haven't done that in a
   while. I'm still in love love love with Copics, so I've been using them
   quite a bit. For me it's all about mixing those colors and creating
   cool combinations, of course. Had a fun time putting these  colors
   together. Pretty much my go-to colors I think.


   2011-12-18_11-01-31_672

   Ugh, this one looks a little blurry.  The painted backgrounds were done
   in a long time ago. I like to paint randomly and then figure out a way
   to make it work and pull it all together.


   2011-12-18_11-01-12_436
   This page was just started...it's still in the works. It'll be fun to
   see how it turns out.

   2011-12-18_11-02-07_212

   I hope you have a great week! Are you ready for Christmas? I'm so
   not...I am an overachiever, so I will just keep on going until the
   25th. Yup, can pretty much count on that. I hope you have a wonderful
   week!

Stephanie's Doodle

   Today I took a lil break, and did some coloring. Copic style. Isn't
   this a darling doodle?


   120911155718
   My friend, Stephanie Ackerman shared it on her blog yesterday. I just
   couldn't pass it up. I did add a the words and face, but that's it.

   Go to her site and download a copy for yourself. Take a color break. It
   feels good.

3 Things on a Friday

   I have three little tidbits for you today.

   1. My Friend, Amy Barickman of The Vintage Workshop has The 2012 ledger
   style Desktop Calendar Journal by Greg Johnson! If you are like me,
   you've been a long time fan of these beautiful calendars. They weren't
   available last year. They are out of stock on Amazon, they went fast! I
   totally missed it.

   Imagine my delight this morning when I got an email from Amy that she
   had them in her online store! Find them here.

   2. Anthropologie Fans: Enter their 20 Days of Gift Giving giveaway. How
   awesome is that?! Go. Enter!

   3. Omaha locals, Chick-Fil-A opened in midtown area this week. For
   everyone...not just Mutual Of O employees! WooHoo!!

Advent Calendars

   Happy December! December 1st officially launches "Christmas" in my
   mind. I'm hoping to do some decorating inside today! One thing I'm
   looking forward to doing is putting out our Advent Calendars.


   2011-11-30_13-57-46_511
   This wooden drawer style Advent calendar was one I got at Target like 3
   or 4 years ago...after seeing   Pam's! I started revamping the drawers
   last year, and finished it last year. So I guess that took me a while!

   I liek it cuz I can tuck goodies into those drawers. I add chocolates,
   a few coins, etc. Wonder what else I can tuck into those little
   drawers?

   2011-11-30_13-56-40_396

   2011-11-30_13-58-10_436

   I do like it, but I really like the one at Target right now, it's
   mirrored on the front. That sends my head spinning with ideas! But
   seriously, I have made soooo many Advent calendars over the years...I
   don't think I can possible do one more.

   This one by Stephanie Lynn is so great. So is this one by Martha
   Stewart.

   Here's  the one I did in 2007. The painted cookie sheet Advent
   Calendar:

   My 12 Days of Comfort & Joy E-Workshop launches today! Happy December!

Finished the Tree, Yay!

   As you know if you are frequent blog reader, I've been embroidering a
   sampler for what seems forever. I shared more of the sampler on this
   blog post.

   2011-11-28_14-40-16_463

   It seems like I worked a whole month on that tree and it's leaves.
   Maybe longer! When I finally finished it this week I sat there in the
   car (in the car pool line) with a huge sense of accomplishment. Whew!
   Now on to the banner and words...

It's almost time!

   I just took a little cyber trip back to the archives of some of my
   former 12 Days of Comfort & Joy E-Workshops and thought I would share a
   few project photos here with you. Maybe they will get your creative
   juices flowing, or put you in a holiday mood! They sure got me excited
   for the holidays!

   Each year of the Workshop I do a new gift journal. It is essential that
   I keep a gift journal...that way I know the # of gifts are the same for
   the kids, and the stocking contents are even...etc.  I know I'm not the
   only one! Here is the one we did in last year's Workshop:


   12days3main (12 Days of Comfort & Joy, 2010)

    Here is  sweet and cheery snowman project:

   12days2finalborder The 12 Days of Comfort & Joy, 2010

   These next two projects are from the 2009 version of The 12 Days of
   Comfort & Joy. They are still yummy, two years later. I love it when
   that happens. This sweet fellow is all bundled up for the cold
   weather...

    And this dear fellow, my Grandpa as a toddler, is tucked into a
   festive tin:

   I've been getting everything ready for THIS year's version of this
   Workshop. There is a pile of doilies, glitter, and ribbons on my studio
   desk right now...time to get to work on the next project!

   I'd be honored to create with you in the upcoming E-Workshop!

Prismacolor Pencils Tutorial

   Hey guys! If you have wondered how to get great color from colored
   pencils I've got a video tutorial that breaks it down for you. It was
   so much fun working with colored pencils to create this video.

   I've been pretty much a Copic girl when it comes to coloring, so this
   was a fun switch-it-up! I love to blend different colors, which is so
   easy to do with Prismacolors.

   I didn't take a photo, but there's a cute card at the end of the video.
   :)

   Here is the newest PDF set of Bellas. This is the couple used in the
   video:

What a Weekend

   Our daughter and her Cross Country Team traveled to The NAIA Nationals
   in Vancouver, Washington. Their team did really well, but it's always
   an honor just to go to nationals. Best of all? She and two of her
   teammates got All American Academic Scholar Awards.

   We. Are. So. Proud. Of. Her!

   4801

   Can't wait for her to come later this week for Thanksgiving! Can't even
   wait.

   Next tidbit to share, our Son (a senior in high school) won 1st place
   in the citywide Chess Tournament for his Division! He has never
   participated in an official chess tourney before, so he was in the
   Unranked Division.


   2011-11-19_14-45-14_946
   His friends, family and school all know he is an amazing chess player,
   and now the city knows, too. So proud of him! This will be great to add
   to those college apps, right?!

That cute embroidery project

   You know I embroider in small time frames, right? In the car
   especially. Car pool line, car trips, etc. Here's what I started this
   Summer sometime.


   2011-11-07_14-34-12_972

   It's one of Pam's embroidery samplers. I thought it would take me
   forever, and I think I'm right. But it's looking good! She has a couple
   of new ones out, too. Her new ones are also adorable, and not as big as
   this one.  They are waiting their turn on my desk. Maybe if I would
   move the sewing basket to the living room, it'd get finished faster?!


   2011-11-07_14-34-05_255

   I finally finished all of the leaves. If you have this pattern you know
   how long it takes.  I'll be sure to show you when it's done!
