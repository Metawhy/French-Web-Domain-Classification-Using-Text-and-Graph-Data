THE #1 FREE, OPEN SOURCE BULLETIN BOARD SOFTWARE

   phpBB is a free flat-forum bulletin board software solution that can be
   used to stay in touch with a group of people or can power your entire
   website. With an extensive database of user-created extensions and
   styles database containing hundreds of style and image packages to
   customise your board, you can create a very unique forum in minutes.

   No other bulletin board software offers a greater complement of
   features, while maintaining efficiency and ease of use. Best of all,
   phpBB is completely free. We welcome you to test it for yourself today.
   If you have any questions please visit our Community Forum where our
   staff and members of the community will be happy to assist you with
   anything from configuring the software to modifying the code for
   individual needs. Learn more about phpBB.
