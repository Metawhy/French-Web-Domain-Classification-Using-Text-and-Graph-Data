Eye-Detection AF

     * Continuously tracks eyes, even when subjects move within the frame
     * Works in AF-S and AF-C focus modes

       giving you the freedom to choose which person and eye to focus on
     * Remains locked on the eyes even when face is partially or
       temporarily obstructed
     * Built on a legacy of Nikon autofocus and facial recognition
       innovations

Even Better AF Performance in Low Light

     * Faster, more accurate focusing indoors and for night portraits
     * Reduces the need to switch to Low-Light AF mode to acquire focus

The Full Frame Advantage
       Z 6s full frame backside-illuminated CMOS sensor is approximately
       1.5 times larger than DX, APS-C and Super 35 formats to achieve the
       widest angle of view possible from your lenses, broader dynamic
       range, shallower depth of field and cleaner low light performance.
     *

Brilliant 4K Ultra HD
       Capture rich 4K video content thats four times the resolution of
       Full HD (3840 x 2160 compared to 1920 x 1080) for greater, denser
       image data and higher quality images.
     *

Full-Pixel Readout
       The Z 6 is one of the few full-frame mirrorless cameras on the
       market capable of full-pixel readout, utilizing more pixels as
       compared to typical readout methodsequivalent to 6Kto deliver
       sharp, beautiful 4K UHD video with minimized noise, aliasing and
       artifacting.

Coming Soon: ProRes RAW Support

   An upcoming firmware upgrade for Z 6 and Z 7 will enable support for
   ProRes RAW when using the kits included Atomos Ninja V. ProRes RAW
   provides the quality and convenience of ProRes while preserving the
   cameras RAW sensor data, giving you maximum flexibility during post
   productions. (Details and firmware release date coming soon.)

Optically superior Nikkor Z lenses

   The growing lineup of new Nikkor Z lenses were designed to take full
   advantage of the Z 6s larger mount and shorter flange distance. But
   the benefits of Nikkor Z lenses dont stop there. As a videographer,
   youll notice reduced focus breathing, less wobbling and quieter
   autofocus. They also feature a new control ring that can be customized
   for smooth, quiet power aperture control or exposure compensation. The
   included Nikkor Z 24-70mm f/4 S is the ideal versatile lens to start
   your video lens arsenal.

Mount Adapter FTZ

Greater performance from your favorite F-Mount lenses

   When used with the included Mount Adapter FTZ, more than 90 F-Mount
   Nikkor lenses maintain all of their sharpness, resolving power and
   functionality and gain the advantages of the Z 6s in-body VR, silent
   shooting, PDAF focusing system^2, 4K video and more. Approximately 360
   F-Mount Nikkor lenses can be used. Compatibility as only Nikon can
   deliver.

   Lens not included

Flexible frame rates

Ultra high quality video, at any rate.

4K at 24/30 fps

   Shoot 4K video at 24 fps for a classic film look or 30 fps for smoother
   videos.

Full HD at 120 fps

   Record video with audio at up to 120 fps in Full HD for smooth fast
   motion. Additionally, this frame rate gives flexibility for post
   production slow motion and speed ramping, adding drama and suspense to
   your videos.

In-Camera Slow Motion

   Capture every moving detail at 120 fps, then play them back at 4x or 5x
   slower speed for jaw dropping, fluid slow motion in 1080p Full HD
   without any post-production.

Smooth and Steady

Superb image stabilization, inside and out.

In-Body 5-Axis VR Image Stabilization

   5-axis in-camera VR image stabilization effectively reduces roll, the
   most common camera vibration during video recording as well as yaw,
   pitch, X and Y. During video recording, optical VR is combined with
   electronic VR (e-VR) for even steadier shots.

   Lens not included

VR For F-Mount Nikkor Lenses

   For the first time, optional F-Mount Nikkor lenses like the AF-S Nikkor
   105mm f/1.4E ED or AF-S Nikkor 14-24mm f/2.8G ED can benefit from
   in-body 3-axis VR^3. Nikkor lenses that already have VR, like the AF-S
   Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8E FL ED VR, get the added benefit of roll axis for
   a total of 3-axis VR. Just add the included Mount Adapter FTZ and
   youre good to go.

Moza Air 2 Handheld Gimbal Stabilizer

Liberate yourself from the tripod.

   Pan, tilt and follow moving subjects with all the smoothness and
   accuracy of high-end studio rigs and dollies. Mount the Z 6 to the
   handheld Moza Air 2 and off you go. Create dynamic sweeping shots, film
   from impossible angles and track tough to follow subjects. The Z 6
   Filmmakers Kit also includes the Moza Magic 11.8" Articulating Arm for
   convenient attachment of the Ninja V Monitor.

   Example of Zebra Stripes (Highlight Display)

Pure Viewing Experience

Clarity that rivals real life.

3.6m-Dot Quad VGA Viewfinder

   Z 6s ultra-high resolution viewfinder provides minimal lag and
   blackout, 100% frame coverage (approx.), corner-to-corner clarity and
   sharp magnification for natural, comfortable filming, even in bright
   light.

Tilting Touchscreen Monitor

   Monitor and review footage on Z 6s beautiful, high-resolution
   touchscreen. 3.2-inches. 2.1-million dots. Crystal clear and vibrant.
   Tilt for filming at high and low angles. Touchscreen control. This
   display is a smooth operator.

Focus Peaking and Zebra Stripes

   Focus or Highlight Peaking allows quick confirmation of focus with a
   color overlay on the areas of the video that are in focus while Zebra
   Stripes (or Highlight Display) confirm that footage is not being
   overexposed.

Portable Cinematic Powerhouse

Ready for your next production.

Atomos Ninja V
       Record and monitor like a pro with the included, fully-compatible
       Atomos Ninja V and unlock the ultimate filmmaking potential of the
       Z 6. Record in 4K 10-bit and N-Log format or simultaneously record
       uncompressed 8-bit 4K UHD movie files to the memory card and the
       Atomos (Atomos Open Protocol supported for syncing start/stop).
     *

N-Log with View Assist
       N-Log format preserves more detail, up to 12 stops of dynamic
       range, shadows and highlights to make color grading more precise in
       post. For easier spot checking of focus and exposure, the new View
       Assist function displays simple gradation compensation, highly
       useful for confirming the final look of the footage.
     *

Built-In Timecode
       All of your Z 6 footage can be timecoded in-camera for easier
       synchronizing and logging, especially when editing shots from
       multi-camera shoots.
