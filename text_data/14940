   Standard Feed Icon

   SimplePie is a very fast and easy-to-use feed parser, written in PHP,
   that puts the 'simple' back into 'really simple syndication'. Flexible
   enough to suit beginners and veterans alike, SimplePie is focused on
   speed, ease of use, compatibility and standards compliance.

   Show some love! Wishlists for Geoffrey, Ryan P., and Ryan M.
