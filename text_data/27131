Life at Logitech

   As a company, we're just the right size for every person to take
   initiative and make things happen. And we're big enough in our
   portfolio for those actions to have a global impact. That's a pretty
   sweet spot to be in and we're always striving to keep it that way.

     * Diversity & Inclusion
       Our commitment to diversity and inclusion enables us to bring

       backgrounds, and of course, the great ideas that come from us all.
       Throughout Logitech, you'll find opportunities to both share and
       learn from your colleagues: from employee resource groups to
       education and outreach activities to inclusion workshops, there is
       always a way to be involved, get to know one another, and come
       together.
     * Learning and Development
       We are an organization that values continuous growth through
       experiences. Our learning and development programs focus on the
       whole person and targets three areas of growth: business and
       interpersonal skills, leadership and management skills, and a
       toolkit for human flourishing. Through executive coaching,
       experiential workshops, and extensive 360s, we believe every
       employee deserves ample opportunity to develop in ways that
       accelerate their impact.

       and work. These initiatives are global, regional and local in
       nature and bring us all together to make our impact extend beyond
       the office.
     * Benefits
       We offer a comprehensive and competitive benefit program that is
       designed to be flexible and care for you and your loved ones, now
       and in the future. And because your good health requires more than
       just medical care, it includes a focus on programs, services and
       perks to keep you happy and well. Below are examples of some of the
       many benefits we offer to Logitech employees. Your eligibility to a

Our People

   At Logitech we believe in pushing boundaries, stretching ourselves and
   challenging each other. We're a place where you can be yourself and
   trust that others are doing the same. We believe that speaking up
   drives better decisions and we want to hear yours.

   "Logitech challenges me to develop fantastic sounding mobile speakers
   that emotionally connect with our customers. The engineering team
   demands excellence and innovation to embrace success "in spite of" the
   technical hurdles. Logitech respects each individual for their unique
   capabilities and maintains a true ethical compass. This is a great
   place to work!"

   "Recruiting for Logitech is a real pleasure. Not only do I get to
   promote a great brand but when I speak about our diverse and innovative
   culture Im speaking the truth - and I know candidates can sense that
   its real. The international dimension to my role was one of the big
   attractions for me when I joined Logitech. Our team collaboration is
   made easy through video conferencing and though I support the DACH
   region from Cork, I never feel like the distance impacts decisions,
   actions or relationships. I also get to keep my German language skills
   fresh which is a major plus for me!"

   "Die richtigen Personen für Logitech anzuwerben ist ein Job der große
   Freude bereitet. Logitech ist eine großartige Marke, und wenn ich mit
   den Bewerbern über die vielfältige und innovative Unternehmenskultur
   spreche spüren diese schnell, dass dies für mich mehr als nur Worte
   sind. Als ich bei Logitech anfing war der internationale Wirkungsgrad
   meiner Position ein großer Anreiz. Unsere Videokonferenz-Systeme
   gestalten die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Teams problemlos. Obwohl ich
   die DACH Region aus Cork (Irland) betreue, spielt die Entfernung daher
   keine Rolle bei Entscheidungsfindungen, Aktionsplanungen oder im
   Beziehungsmanagement. Ein zusätzlicher Pluspunkt ist zudem, dass meine
   Deutschkenntnisse dabei erhalten bleiben."

Our People

   At Logitech we believe in pushing boundaries, stretching ourselves and
   challenging each other. We're a place where you can be yourself and
   trust that others are doing the same. We believe that speaking up
   drives better decisions and we want to hear yours.

   Electrical Engineer IV

   Camas, Washington

   "Logitech challenges me to develop fantastic sounding mobile speakers
   that emotionally connect with our customers. The engineering team
   demands excellence and innovation to embrace success "in spite of" the
   technical hurdles. Logitech respects each individual for their unique
   capabilities and maintains a true ethical compass. This is a great
   place to work!"

   "Recruiting for Logitech is a real pleasure. Not only do I get to
   promote a great brand but when I speak about our diverse and innovative
   culture Im speaking the truth - and I know candidates can sense that
   its real. The international dimension to my role was one of the big
   attractions for me when I joined Logitech. Our team collaboration is
   made easy through video conferencing and though I support the DACH
   region from Cork, I never feel like the distance impacts decisions,
   actions or relationships. I also get to keep my German language skills
   fresh which is a major plus for me!"

   "Die richtigen Personen für Logitech anzuwerben ist ein Job der große
   Freude bereitet. Logitech ist eine großartige Marke, und wenn ich mit
   den Bewerbern über die vielfältige und innovative Unternehmenskultur
   spreche spüren diese schnell, dass dies für mich mehr als nur Worte
   sind. Als ich bei Logitech anfing war der internationale Wirkungsgrad
   meiner Position ein großer Anreiz. Unsere Videokonferenz-Systeme
   gestalten die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Teams problemlos. Obwohl ich
   die DACH Region aus Cork (Irland) betreue, spielt die Entfernung daher
   keine Rolle bei Entscheidungsfindungen, Aktionsplanungen oder im
   Beziehungsmanagement. Ein zusätzlicher Pluspunkt ist zudem, dass meine
   Deutschkenntnisse dabei erhalten bleiben."

   "Working for Logitech brings me continuous growth in a wide range of
   fields because the teams are diligent, knowledgeable and talented.
   Also, working for Logitech brings me honorable glory because of its
   reputation in the gaming industry, which I'm justifiably proud of. I
   enjoy working for Logitech and look forward to contributing my best
   effort to the success of the company!"

   "Whether you are an intern or a VP, your opinion is just as valuable.
   From my first day as an intern, I was treated just like any other
   employee. As an employee now, I feel empowered and encouraged by my
   team and by Logitech to pursue new ideas without a fear of failure."

   "As a designer, I've found that every day at Logi represents new
   challenges and ultimately, new opportunities to have a real impact on
   the products people love. The design team is in a unique position of
   being able to see across each business and brand, helping to drive the
   ultimate goal of a consistent, human-centered approach to product
   design. I'm also fortunate in that I've been able to help build a team
   of thoughtful and talented designers that keep me inspired and
   dedicated to that goal."
