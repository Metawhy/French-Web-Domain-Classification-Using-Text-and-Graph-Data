DeplOyment and seCurisaTion of new functiOnalities in virtualized networking
enviRonments

   [illustr_01.png]

A new trend in the networking area has emerged in the last few years: the
virtualization of network functions. NFV (Network Virtualization Function),
as defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), is
the key technology that leverages this concept. It involves implementing
network functions in software that can run on a range of industry standard
commodity server hardware. This initiative favors the progressive deployment
of new network functions or protocols.

   The DOCTOR project provides a major push towards the adoption of these
   new standards by enabling a secure use of virtualized network
   equipment, which will ease the deployment of novel networking
   architectures. In the project, we take the use-case of NDN as an
   example of a new emerging stack. We investigate the co-existence of IP
   and NDN, and the progressive migration of traffic from one stack to the
   other in a virtualized environment. To reach this aim, we advocate a
   practical methodology consisting of setting up a real testbed. This
   testbed allow real end-users to access real web sites using the
   developed virtualized networking environment, hosting the NDN
   networking stack in parallel with IP. The deployed testbed will provide
   real traces and give feedback to guide our research, targeting the
   improvement of the monitoring and security aspects of the virtualized
   architecture.

   Monitoring and security are primary operator requirements that need to
   be assured before deploying new solutions. In DOCTOR, we investigate
   how to monitor networks stacks deployed in a virtualized environment,
   regarding: the type of information to monitor, the way to collect it
   and the way to analyse/correlate the information gathered. This
   monitored data will be useful for security purposes. Leveraging a
   virtualized networking technology requires a full rethought of the way
   the security has to be designed, implemented and orchestrated. In
   DOCTOR, we focus on the secure deployment, attack detection and
   mitigation, for protocols deployed in an NFV framework as network
   functions.

   The DOCTOR consortium (Orange, Thales, Montimage, CNRS-LORIA, ICD) is
   very complementary and provides the necessary expertise and skills:
   network operator, security experts, monitoring solution providers and
   recognized academic partners operating security labs at the national
   level. The project outcomes will have a major impact on the industrial
   partners' evolution. Deploying a virtualized infrastructure will allow
   Orange to innovate more in the network and offer new opportunities to
   its customers (both end-users and B2B customers). Thales will integrate
   results of the project into their Cyber Operational Centers (CYBELS)
   offer, such as the assessment of novel vulnerabilities related to
   virtualized networking environments that add considerable value to
   their existing offer. Montimage will extend its monitoring (MMT)
   solution with the project's outcomes related to monitoring, security
   inspection and performance analysis, in order to provide customized
   solutions in the field of virtualized function monitoring.
