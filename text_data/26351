   Railroads and the Making of Modern America collects and makes available
   a wide array of materials documenting the social effects of the
   railroad and the transformation of the United States to modern ideas,
   institutions, and practices in the nineteenth century. The project
   utilizes the digital medium to investigate, represent, and analyze this
   social change and document episodes of the railroad's social
   consequences. Here you will find interpretive visualizations exploring
   and representing the ways railroads changed understandings of space and
   time, the development of slavery around railroad growth in the South,
   the migration and settlement of railroad lands, and the political
   opposition to railroads around rates. Railroads is meant to act as a
   research and teaching platform to test hypotheses, to create
   visualizations of complex processes, and to inspire scholarship.
