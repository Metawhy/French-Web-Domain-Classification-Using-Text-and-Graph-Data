Automated Passport Control (APC)

   WHAT IS AUTOMATED PASSPORT CONTROL?

   Automated Passport Control (APC) is a U.S. Customs and Border
   Protection (CBP) program that expedites the entry process for U.S.,
   Canadian and eligible Visa Waiver Program international travelers by
   providing an automated process through CBP’s Primary Inspection
   area. Travelers use self-service kiosks to respond to CBP inspection
   related questions and submit biographic information. APC is a free
   service, does not require pre-registration or membership, and maintains
   the highest levels of protection when it comes to the handling of
   personal data or information.  Travelers using APC experience shorter
   wait times, less congestion, and faster processing.

   HOW DOES APC WORK?

   Instead of filling out a paper Customs declaration form, eligible
   passengers can proceed directly to the APC kiosks in the passport
   control area. Travelers are prompted to scan their passport, take a
   photograph using the kiosk, and answer a series of CBP inspection
   related questions verifying biographic and flight information. Once
   passengers have completed the series of questions, a receipt will be
   issued.  Travelers then bring their passport and receipt to a CBP
   Officer to finalize their inspection for entry into the United
   States. The kiosks allow people residing at the same address to be
   processed together.

   WHERE CAN ELIGIBLE TRAVELERS USE APC?

   APC kiosks are currently operational at the following airports:
     * Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)

   Automated Passport Control Frequently Asked Questions

Who is eligible to use APC?

   APC kiosks can be utilized by U.S. citizens, U.S. legal permanent
   residents, Canadian citizens, travelers utilizing ESTA (Visa Waiver
   Program), and travelers entering with a B1/B2 or D visa.

Is APC safe and secure technology?

   Yes, the APC technology does not store any personal
   information. Travelers’ passport information and answers to the
   declaration questions are submitted directly to CBP via secure
   encryption protocols similar to how it’s done by a CBP officer at a
   booth.

Do travelers still have to fill out a Customs declaration form?

   No, travelers will submit their Customs declaration form electronically
   via the kiosks. If a traveler has already filled out a Customs
   declaration form, it can be given to a CBP Officer for shredding.

What languages are available on APC kiosks?

   English, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Dutch, German, Chinese
   (Traditional/Simplified) and Japanese.

   Automated Passport Control (APC) is a U.S. Customs and Border
   Protection (CBP) program that expedites the entry process for U.S.,
   Canadian and eligible Visa Waiver Program international travelers by
   providing an automated process through CBP’s Primary Inspection
   area. Travelers use self-service kiosks to respond to CBP inspection
   related questions and submit biographic information. APC is a free
   service, does not require pre-registration or membership, and maintains
   the highest levels of protection when it comes to the handling of
   personal data or information.  Travelers using APC experience shorter
   wait times, less congestion, and faster processing.

   HOW DOES APC WORK?

   Instead of filling out a paper Customs declaration form, eligible
   passengers can proceed directly to the APC kiosks in the passport
   control area. Travelers are prompted to scan their passport, take a
   photograph using the kiosk, and answer a series of CBP inspection
   related questions verifying biographic and flight information. Once
   passengers have completed the series of questions, a receipt will be
   issued.  Travelers then bring their passport and receipt to a CBP
   Officer to finalize their inspection for entry into the United
   States. The kiosks allow people residing at the same address to be
   processed together.

   Automated Passport Control Frequently Asked Questions

Who is eligible to use APC?

   APC kiosks can be utilized by U.S. citizens, U.S. legal permanent
   residents, Canadian citizens, travelers utilizing ESTA (Visa Waiver
   Program), and travelers entering with a B1/B2 or D visa.

Is APC safe and secure technology?

   Yes, the APC technology does not store any personal
   information. Travelers’ passport information and answers to the
   declaration questions are submitted directly to CBP via secure
   encryption protocols similar to how it’s done by a CBP officer at a
   booth.

Do travelers still have to fill out a Customs declaration form?

   No, travelers will submit their Customs declaration form electronically
   via the kiosks. If a traveler has already filled out a Customs
   declaration form, it can be given to a CBP Officer for shredding.

What languages are available on APC kiosks?

   English, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Dutch, German, Chinese
   (Traditional/Simplified) and Japanese.
