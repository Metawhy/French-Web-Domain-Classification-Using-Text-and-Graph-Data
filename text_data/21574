Increase website traffic.

   For your website to be successful, you must treat it like an ongoing
   conversation between you and your visitors. Knowing how your visitors
   find your site, where they are located, what content resonates with
   them and which products or services they are considering is a crucial
   starting point for that conversation and opens up a wealth of
   opportunities to attract, engage and convert those anonymous visitors
   into loyal customers.
   Increase Website Traffic

Generate sales leads.

   Statistically, less than 2% of your website visitors get in touch with
   you while 98% remain anonymous. Considering the significant investment
   you've made in building and marketing your website, wouldn't it be
   great if you had the opportunity to convert everyone who has shown
   interest? Identify and track anonymous businesses visiting your site so
   you can reach out to them before they reach out to your competitors.

Detect click fraud.

   Click fraud is an increasing problem for any business running digital
   advertising campaigns on Google Adwords or Bing Ads, with an estimated
   25% of ad clicks being fraudulent in 2017. That's a quarter of your
   digital advertising spend being lost to clicks by bots, click farms and
   competitors. Reduce your paid traffic costs by up to 25% by detecting
   click fraud and reporting it to your ad network.
