   Artificial intelligence has long been a major focus for tech leaders
   across industries. Big corporations across every sector, from retail to
   agriculture, are trying to integrate machine learning into their
   products. At the same time, there is an acute shortage of AI talent.

   This combination is fueling a heated race to scoop up top AI startups,
   many of which are still in the early stages of research and funding.

   Below, we dig into AI acquisition trends, from which companies are the
   most acquisitive to what areas of focus are attracting the most
   attention.

Tech giants lead in ai acquisitions

   The usual suspects are leading the race for AI: tech giants like
   Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, & Apple (FAMGA) have all been
   aggressively acquiring AI startups in the last decade.

   Among the FAMGA companies, Apple leads the way, making 20 total AI
   acquisitions since 2010. It is followed by Google (the frontrunner from
   2012 to 2016) with 14 acquisitions and Microsoft with 10.

   Apple’s AI acquisition spree, which has helped it overtake Google in
   recent years, was essential to the development of new iPhone
   features. For example, FaceID, the technology that allows users to
   unlock their iPhone X just by looking at it, stems from Apple’s M&A
   moves in chips and computer vision, including the acquisition of AI
   company RealFace.

   In fact, many of FAMGA’s prominent products and services came out of
   acquisitions of AI companies — such as Apple’s Siri, or Google’s
   contributions to healthcare through DeepMind.

   That said, tech giants are far from the only companies snatching up AI
   startups.

   Since 2010, there have been 635 AI acquisitions, as companies aim to
   build out their AI capabilities and capture sought-after talent (as of
   8/31/2019).

   The pace of these acquisitions has also been increasing. AI
   acquisitions saw a more than 6x uptick from 2013 to 2018, including
   last year’s record of 166 AI acquisitions — up 38% year-over-year.

   In 2019, there have already been 140+ acquisitions (as of
   August), putting the year on track to beat the 2018 record at the
   current run rate.

   Part of this increase in the pace of AI acquisitions can be attributed
   to a growing diversity in acquirers. Where once AI was the exclusive
   territory of major tech companies, today, smaller AI startups are
   becoming acquisition targets for traditional insurance, retail, and
   healthcare incumbents.

   For example, in February 2018, Roche Holding acquired New York-based
   cancer startup Flatiron Health for $1.9B — one of the largest M&A deals
   in artificial intelligence. This year, Nike acquired AI-powered
   inventory management startup Celect, Uber acquired computer vision
   company Mighty AI, and McDonald’s acquired personalization
   platform Dynamic Yield.

   Despite the increased number of acquirers, however, tech giants are
   still leading the charge. Acquisitive tech giants have emerged as
   powerful global corporations with a competitive advantage in artificial
   intelligence, and startups have played a pivotal role in helping these
   companies scale their AI initiatives.

   Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, and Amazon are the most
   active acquirers of AI startups, each acquiring 7+ companies.

   Meanwhile, the vast majority of acquirers (431) have only acquired a
   single AI company.

Heatmap: acquirers focus on retail & Speech

   We created a heatmap of AI acquisitions sorted across 15+ core
   industries that startups operated in prior to acquisition (such as
   healthcare or finance), or by one of 12 cross-industry applications
   (like sales or cybersecurity).

   Retail & CPG topped all other industries in the number of AI
   acquisitions (67 since 2010), due to record-level M&A activity last
   year. These acquisitions have added AI-driven customer analytics,
   in-store inventory management, and personalized e-commerce experiences
   to retailer’s capabilities.

   Recent examples include McDonald’s $300M acquisition of personalization
   platform Dynamic Yield, Ulta Beauty’s acquisitions of virtual makeover
   startup GlamST and customer engagement software company QM Scientific,
   and Nike’s acquisitions of inventory management company Celect and
   guided shopping experience platform Invertex.

   Under cross-industry applications, Speech, NLP/(G), and Computer Vision
   has been a leading area of focus. The category, which includes startups
   working on computer vision and natural language processing, has seen 66
   acquisitions since 2010.

   Large tech companies have scooped up smaller startups in this category
   to boost their internal AI R&D. For example, Apple acquired facial
   recognition firm RealFace and voice assistant startup Novauris
   Technologies, Google acquired human-computer interaction
   company Api.ai, and Microsoft acquired speech recognition & NLP
   startup Semantic Machines and voice assistant company Maluuba.

   Our definition of AI companies includes startups selling AI SaaS (such
   as machine learning-based cyber defense software), using AI algorithms
   to develop their core products (such as AI-enabled diagnostic devices),
   developing hardware to support AI workloads (startups building AI
   processors for edge and cloud data centers), and AI “consultancies”
   (companies tailoring solutions to individual clients).

   We include autonomous cars, trucks, and tractors, but exclude other
   hardware-focused robotics companies, as well as pure-play VR companies.
   We only count direct acquisitions made by parent companies, not
   subsidiaries, in our acquisition count analysis. Data is as of 2019 YTD

   We took a look at some of Facebook’s emotion-based patents to
   understand how the company is thinking about capturing and responding
   to people’s emotional reactions, which has been a tricky area for
   consumer tech companies but key to their future. On the one hand, they
   want to identify which content is most engaging and respond to
   audience’s reactions, on the other emotion-detection is technically
   difficult, not to mention a PR and ethical minefield.

Patent: Augmenting text messages with emotion information

   Date filed: November 24, 2015

   Date granted: May 25, 2017

   This patent would automatically add emotional information to text
   messages, predicting the user’s emotion based on methods of keyboard
   input. The visual format of the text message would adapt in real time
   based on the user’s predicted emotion. As the patent notes (and as many
   people have likely experienced), it can be hard to convey mood and
   intended meaning in a text-only message; this system would aim to
   reduce misunderstandings.

   The system could pick up data from the keyboard, mouse, touch pad,
   touch screen, or other input devices, and the patent mentions
   predicting emotion based on relative typing speed, how hard the keys
   are pressed, movement (using the phone’s accelerometer), location, and
   other factors.

   CBI FB augmented text messages emotions

   To integrate emotional data into the messages, Facebook could change
   the text font, size, spacing, or use other formatting tools.
     __________________________________________________________________

Patent: Techniques for emotion detection and content delivery

   Date filed (application): February 25, 2014

   Date published (application): August 27, 2015

   This patent proposes capturing images of the user through smartphone or
   laptop cameras, even when the user is not actively using the camera. By
   visually tracking a user’s facial expression, Facebook aims to monitor
   the user’s emotional reactions to different types of content.

   CBI FB emotion detection and content delivery

   To monitor the user, Facebook proposes using “passive imaging data,” or
   visual data captured automatically through a laptop or phone’s
   front-facing camera. The user often faces this camera without thinking
   about it, while using the phone or laptop normally, and Facebook hopes
   to start leveraging this imaging data.

   Once the system captures the images, an API component would identify
   the user’s emotion and store the data. Then, Facebook could a)
   determine which emotions a piece of content elicits, which could be
   useful for Facebook as well as the content producers, and b) deliver
   content to the user based on the displayed emotion, which could help
   Facebook keep users more engaged.

Patent: Systems and methods for dynamically generating emojis based on image
analysis of facial features

   Date filed (application): November 16, 2015

   Date published (application): May 18, 2017

   This patent describes a more streamlined process for sending messages
   with emojis. The system would capture real-time image data of a face
   (such as through a selfie) and analyze the facial features to determine
   the user’s emotion, and map it to the emoji that would be the best fit.
   For example, it could serve up a smiling emoji in response to a photo
   of someone smiling. The user can then add the emoji to a post or
   message.

   CBI FB dynamically generating emojis from photos

   The patent mentions several additional features, such as the ability to
   modify the emoji based on more detailed analysis of the user’s face,
   and the ability to capture gestures made by the user and add those to
   the emoji (such as the thumbs up in the image above).

   By reducing users’ facial expressions to emojis from a pre-set list,
   Facebook could potentially analyze users’ emotions more easily.
   Facebook could gain clearer insight into feelings and reactions, while
   also adding a new interactive feature.
