       alternative lawful data transfer mechanism, or alternatively the
       Personal Information is transferred to a country with an adequacy
       recognition by the EU Commission.
       10. INFORMATION SECURITY

       dispute arising out of or relating to this DPA. The escalation
       process will be used to address disputed issues related to the
       performance of this DPA, including but not limited to technical
       problems. The Parties agree to communicate regularly about any open
       issues or process problems that require prompt and accurate
       resolution as set forth in their respective escalation process
       documentation. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
       any dispute arising out of or relating to this DPA, before and as a
       prior condition for commencing legal proceedings of any kind, first
       as set forth above in the escalation process and next by

       a summary of arguments supporting that position and (b) the name
       and title of the executive who will represent that Party and of any
       other person who will accompany the executive. Within five (5)
       business days after delivery of the disputing Party’s notice, the
       executives of both Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time
       and place, including telephonically, and thereafter as often as
       they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute.
       All reasonable requests for information made by one Party to the
       other will be honored. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are
       confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement
       negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence.

       unless made in writing and executed by duly authorized personnel of
       both parties.
       18.2. Invalidation of one or more of the provisions under this DPA
       will not affect the remaining provisions. Invalid provisions will
       be replaced to the extent possible by those valid provisions which
       achieve essentially the same objectives.
