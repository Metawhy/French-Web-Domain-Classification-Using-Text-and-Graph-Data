INNOVATIVE  OMAKASE

ORIGINAL OMAKASE × UNIQUE TWIST ON TRADITIONAL SUSHI


ABOUT

Innovative omakase. That’s what Chef/Owner Don Pham is bringing to the
Manhattan’s Upper East Side neighborhood with the opening of his first
restaurant, Sushi Ishikawa.

   With ultimate integrity in everything he does from his cooking to the
   products he sources from around the world, Chef Pham has designed two
   original omakase menus: 12 courses ($85) and 15 courses ($125), which
   will change based on product availability and seasonality, and Pham’s
   whim!

   As a long-time, highly experienced and passionate sushi chef in NYC,
   who is known for putting a unique twist on traditional sushi, as well
   as his fun and charismatic personality, Chef Pham customizes his sushi
   selections for each guest, providing the most personalized and
   mouth-watering omakase experience.

   Chef Pham and his team look forward to welcoming you!

DON PHAM
Chef/Owner

   Vietnamese born Chef/Owner Don Pham has been working in premier sushi
   restaurants in NYC for over 17 years.  He most recently was the
   Executive Sushi Chef at Tim and Nancy Cushman’s inventive sushi and
   Japanese restaurant, O Ya, which debuted in NYC in 2015.

   Prior to O Ya, Chef Pham held Executive Chef/Sushi Chef positions at
   various NYC sushi and Japanese hot spots.  He was the Sushi Chef at the
   popular Japanese restaurant Morimoto in Chelsea Market; Head Chef at
   Kitaro Restaurant on the Upper West Side; and Executive Chef at Geisha,
   Serafina Restaurant Group’s original Japanese fusion restaurant, which
   opened in 2003 as a collaboration with Chef Eric Ripert.  Besides
   preparing all of Geisha’s delectable sushi, Chef Pham also trained and
   supervised the staff, then moved on to the role of Master Sushi Chef at
   Geisha’s whimsical spin-off izakaya, Geisha Table, which adjoined
   Serafina’s Upper West Side location.  Chef Pham held this role until
   Geisha’s closing in 2013.

   Chef Pham is proud to be serving his delicious and innovative omakase
   at his own place, Sushi Ishikawa, on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

Located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, Sushi Ishikawa is a purveyor of fine
Japanese sushi from the esteemed Chef Don Pham.

FROM NEW YORK MAGAZINE:

   The chef of this omakase restaurant has worked in the city’s sushi
   scene for nearly two decades, paying his dues as the sushi chef at
   Morimoto, executive chef at (the now-shuttered) Geisha, and, most
   recently, as executive sushi chef at O Ya. At Sushi Ishikawa, there are
   just 24 seats, with 12 primo slots at the counter and the rest at
   tables. Two menus will be offered, with one at 12 courses for $85 —
   considerably less than competitors like Suzuki and Ichimura— and
   another at 15 courses for $125. And Pham is going beyond raw fish —
   what’s served will change consistently, but expect the likes of black
   abalone with mushroom soup, hairy crab, and octopus with green-tea
   salt. — Chris Crowley
