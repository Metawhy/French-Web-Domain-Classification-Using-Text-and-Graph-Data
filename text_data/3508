                          Loving well is a choice.

                             Legacy is built by
                           living with intention.

                             Gathering together
                          builds a meaningful life.

                      Celebration is a non-negotiable.

                     Strong homes lay a firm foundation.

   We are the difference makers. We impact those we raise, and the ripples
   reach far beyond our grasp, stretching into generations. We are the
   most important leaders, our influence setting our families on a course
   for good. The daily actions that seem so small, add up to mountains of
   deposits that build the very foundation on which children stand
   forever. We live by the truth that roots go deep when love is strong.
   It is for this reason that we gather at this virtual table. Let’s
   change the world by impacting our homes.

RECLAIMING HOME

   By: Krista Gilbert
   Are you watching as your family spins out of control?
   We live in an era when children often know more about their electronic
   devices than their own family history, parents invest more time in the
   carpool line than at the dinner table, and marriages teeter on the
   cliff of neglect. Reclaiming Home offers families creative,
   life-changing solutions to these modern day dilemmas. Learn how to
   deposit small pebbles of intentional action into daily life to build a
   mountain on which your family can stand for generations.

   “Krista is an excellent communicator. She is engaging, funny, and well
     organized. She welcomes interaction with the audience and is a good
    listener as well as a presenter. Krista is open about her experiences
    and brings the audience with her, even in her discussion of difficult
       topics. We were extremely pleased with both of her sessions.”
         – David Erb, Chairman @ Adult Education, Covenant U.M.C.
