Investing in education.

   We believe in the right to education as a weapon against injustice and
   inequality. Access to quality education is not only a basic human
   right, it is a critical component of a foundation for a more productive
   and happier life.

   children and young people are affected by natural disasters each year.

Changing the emergency response model.

   Climate change is resulting in an increase in natural disasters. Rather
   than just responding, we harness the power of philanthropy to help more
   communities prepare and withstand disasters before they hit.

Advocating for progress.

   We take on issues at a global scale, advocating for change through the
   voices of Rihanna and her fans.

   of primary school increases a girl's prospective income by 20%

     "The lack of access to education for children around the world is a
     massive problem, but that doesn't mean we should just throw up our
     hands in despair and surrender." Rihanna

One voice is just the beginning.

   By taking risks and testing new partnership models, CLF is not only
   funding innovative programs around the world but redefining what is
   possible within philanthropy.

The solutions are within reach. This is your invitation to help change the
world. Join us.
