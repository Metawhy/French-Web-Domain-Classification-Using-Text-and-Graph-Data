Inspiration: Arthur Rackham

   One of my all-time favourite illustrators is Arthur Rackham,
   illustrating fairy tales, fantasy stories and classics- and he was
   amazing at drawing trees. He was part of the Golden Age of British book
   illustration. He created his work using pen and ink with watercolour.
   Here are a few examples of his work, for some mid-week inspiration:

Turtle island tree mural project- Happy Canada Day!

   Happy Canada Day!
   After learning about Indigenous history and some Ojibwe creation
   stories, my Grade 4 and 5 class created this mural in the school
   library. Each student designed a circle to add to the mural with
   symbols and colours that represent their identity.
   I sketched the tree on the wall and another teacher drew the turtle.
   Students painted the tree and the turtle and added patterns on top of
   the bark.
   It still seems miraculous that we managed to complete this project in 2
   weeks! Everyone had a lot of fun and the students will leave a lasting
   legacy.
   We used house paint and paint markers (for finer details).

Symbolic Self-portrait class project

   [IMG_3363.jpeg]
   A fun and rewarding studio art project is the Symbolic Self-portrait.
   To do this you will need a projector and some large coloured paper.
   Step 1: tape a piece of large coloured paper to the projector screen
   Step 2: have each student come up one at a time and sit on a chair in
   profile in front of the projector screen and shine the projector
   towards the screen (this creates a shadow profile of the student on the
   paper that you taped up)
   Step 3: trace the outline of the student's profile on the paper (or
   have students work in pairs to trace each others' profiles)
   Step 4: have students brainstorm things that represent their identity
   Step 5: have students research visual references for their chosen
   symbols and items
   Step 6: have students organize the space inside their traced profile to
   draw their symbols using the reference images they found

Coco Oil Pastel scratch-board project

   Recently my class had a great time making their own scratch-board using
   oil pastels. We used the "Land of the Dead" from the movie Coco as
   inspiration for a colourful, geometric, fantasy landscape.
   Step 1: use warm coloured crayons to colour a white sheet of paper
   Step 2: cover the crayon completely with black oil pastel
   Step 3: use a toothpick to draw (scratch away) a geometric landscape to
   reveal the colour beneath
   This is great way to use a new technique with different materials and
   practice using the principle of design: contrast and the elements of
   design: colour, shape and form.
   Here are some examples of student work:

Class Snowflake Project

   Happy Holidays!
   A simple, traditional and fun winter art activity is the class
   snowflake project. For this, I used two different basic templates for
   students to use as guides and then cut to make their own patterns.
   They look great all together up in the hall, and make the school look
   more festive and ready for winter!
