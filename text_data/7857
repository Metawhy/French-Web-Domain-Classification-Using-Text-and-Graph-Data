   Since May 1st 2012, Égide became Campus France! Campus France, Agence
   française pour la promotion de l’enseignement supérieur, l’accueil et
   la mobilité internationale, was born of the merger between Égide, the
   GIP CampusFrance and the activities of the Sub-Directorate of
   International Affairs of the CNOUS.
