SIAM - Graduate Chapter

Breadcrumb

   Home Organizations SIAM - Graduate Chapter

   The CU Boulder graduate student chapter of SIAM was founded as an
   organization to meet the needs of graduate students interested in
   mathematics and its applications. Chapter functions include technical
   presentations by students, faculty, and industry speakers, field trips
   and social events. Most recently, this has included participating in
   the annual Front Range Applied Mathematics Student Conference, monthly
   seminars on student research, presentations from mathematicians now
   working in industry, and math movie/game nights. These events are
   designed to introduce students to the widespread use of mathematics in
   engineering and the sciences, and promote a sense of community among
   our students.

   Our chapter's membership is primarily from the Department of Applied
   Mathematics, but our activities have attracted students from other
   science and engineering disciplines as well. All interested students,
   from any department, are encouraged to participate in SIAM-sponsored
   events.

   For more information, call (5-3752), stop by the Applied Math office
   (ECOT 225), or email Harry Dudley.

   Please send questions and comments to Harry Dudley.
