Our Vision

   Become the industry leader for the treatment of Gut Microbiota
   alteration (Dysbiosis) using patient-specific biotherapeutics in
   patients with serious medical conditions.

Our Mission

   Our initial goal is to develop a series of biotherapeutics aiming to
   improve the survival outcome of blood cancer. Our revolutionary MaaT
   Microbiome Restoration Therapy (MMRB) discovery and analysis platform
   will support the evaluation of drug candidates, the determination of
   novel disease targets and the identification of biomarkers for
   microbiome-related conditions.

     * Financing

   MaaT Pharma has established several strong business partnerships. We
   have developed an efficient academic-industry translational
   collaboration with two entities from INRA (Institut National de la
   Recherche Agronomique or French National Institute for Agricultural
   Research): Micalis and MetaGenoPolis to design our proprietary MaaT
   Microbiome Restoration Platform which is the engine of our drug
   development platform. We also established a partnership with Biocodex
   in the area of oral formulation development. These two collaborations
   have led to the filing of 8 patent families and 1 patent in-license
   agreement.

   The microbiome industry is emerging, especially the notion of
   developing therapeutics sourced from gut microbiota. As of today, there
   are three main approaches: Fecal microbiotherapy (via enteral or oral
   adminstration), microbiota modulators (agonists or antagonists) or
   molecules mimicking microbial components or products. We compete in the
   field of developing drugs based on the concept of fecal microbiotherapy
   using a unique pooled technology allowing very high diversity
   restoration. This approach has showed the highest efficacy in the
   therapeutic area of Clostridium difficile.

   We have been working in coordination with the French regulatory agency
   (ANSM) since we designed our initial clinical development program
   framework in 2014 aiming at evaluating our microbiota-based drugs.
   Since then, we have extended our discussions at the EMA level as well
   as local competent national authorities and the FDA, in the USA. As for
   our medical devices, they were developed in line with the 93/42/CEE
   directive. We intend to obtain a CE marking for all our devices. To
   date, our collection device is CE marked, whereas the certification for
   our class II storage bag and accessories is expected by Q1 -2019.

   MaaT Pharma targets to develop products that would be primarily
   prescribed by physicians in hospitals. We have, to date, completed
   several clinical trials that were conducted in 12 different hospitals
   in France where we initially assessed our drug candidates. We are now
   expanding geographically to 20 additional hospitals in Europe thanks to
   our clinical trial in acute GvHD.

   We are located in the Gerland Biodistrict in Lyon, a vibrant ecosystem
   composed of leading businesses, SMEs and start-ups, research
   laboratories, universities and elite institutions, where we have
   established successful partnerships. We are also a member of the
   Lyonbiopole Cluster, the gateway to healthcare innovation in the
   Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

   Since our foundation in December 2014, Seventure, a subsidiary of
   Natixis and the first European fund devoted to microbiome investments
   “Health for Life”, has been a shareholder along with CM-CIC Innovation,
   one of the leading financers in high tech companies in France,
   Biocodex, an independent multinational pharmaceutical leader focused
   initially on probiotics, and finally the National Institute for
   Agricultural Research (INRA,) one of the leading academic centers in
   the field of Microbiota. As of March 2018, MaaT Pharma has raised 12 m€
   in equity and 5+ m€ in non-dilutive funding thanks to the support from
   Bpifrance and our banking pool CIC and BNP Paribas.

We restore microbiome function

to treat life-threatening diseases

   We are a clinical stage oncology company and industry leader in
   microbiome restoration therapy using biotherapeutics, made of a high
   diversity microbiome, to treat life-threatening diseases.
   Our Pipeline

   Our Technology

   We are a clinical stage oncology company and industry leader in
   microbiome restoration therapy which has demonstrated safety and
   restoration of both immune homeostasis and gut barrier integrity in a
   Phase 1a/2b trial in AML patients. As an initial focus, we are
   committed to improving overall survival in blood cancers and
   graft-versus-host disease. We have established the MMRB (MaaT
   Microbiome Restoration Biotherapeutics) integrative platform to develop
   our lead product, determine novel disease targets and identify
   biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions. We benefit from the
   commitment of world-leading scientists and established relationships
   with regulators to spear-head microbiome treatment integration into
   clinical practice.
