   6.2.1 The Information presented in this Website may contain
   forward-looking statements concerning the financial position, operating
   results, activities and industrial strategy of the Company, TOTAL S.A.
   and/or companies of the Total group. Such statements are subject to
   risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs and
   assumptions of management and on the information currently available to
   management. Forward-looking statements include information concerning
   forecasts, projections, anticipated synergies, and other information
   concerning possible or assumed future results and may be preceded by,
   followed by, or otherwise include the words “believes”, “expects”,
   “anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “targets”, “estimates” or similar
   expressions. Forward-looking statements are not assurances of results
   or values. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Future
   results may differ materially from those expressed in these
   forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine
   these results and values are beyond the Company’s ability to control or
   predict.

   6.2.2 The documents included in this website may contain
   forward-looking information on the Group (including objectives and
   trends), as well as forward-looking statements within the meaning of

   forward-looking information and statements included in these documents
   are based on a number of economic data and assumptions made in a given

   inaccurate in the future, and are subject to a number of risk factors
   that could lead to a significant difference between actual results and
   those anticipated, including currency fluctuations, the price of
   petroleum products, the ability to realize cost reductions and
   operating efficiencies without unduly disrupting business operations,
   environmental regulatory considerations and general economic and
   business conditions. Certain financial information is based on
   estimates particularly in the assessment of the recoverable value of
   assets and potential impairments of assets relating thereto.

   Neither TOTAL nor any of its subsidiaries assumes any obligation to
   update publicly any forward-looking information or statement,
   objectives or trends contained in these documents whether as a result
   of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information on
   factors, risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s
   financial results or the Group’s activities is provided in the most
