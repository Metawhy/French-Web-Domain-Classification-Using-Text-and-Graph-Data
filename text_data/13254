   Loved everything about Shanghai. Very nice scenery at night and The
   Bund is a must to see.

   Shanghai makes for a great introduction to mainland China. Although it
   can still be overwhelming, it's easier to get around more western
   Shanghai -- while still absorbing so much Chinese culture and history
   -- than in other parts of the country. Make sure you see the French
   Concession area, and enjoy some xiao long bao!

   I've been to Shanghai four times, for thee-day weekends when I lived in
   Beijing. I went there to visit Disneyland, and loved staying at a hotel
   called the Home Inn (Kangqiao Xiuyan Road Metro Station)
   如家快捷酒店（上海康桥秀沿路地铁站店）（原秀沿路工业园区店） because it was affordable, close to the
   park, and lets foreigners stay there.

   Shanghai has always been the cosmopolitan representative of China...it
   was chic, modern and beautiful when it was first introduced to the
   Western world in the 1800s, it is chic, modern and beautiful now and
   more than ever.
