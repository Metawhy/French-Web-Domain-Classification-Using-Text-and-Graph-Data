About

Born from Detroit Ingenuity

   The Webaround is a product and a company dreamed up late at night
   inside a Detroit area Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

   I am a Registered Nurse, wife, mother, inventor, entrepreneur and small
   business owner. During the midnight shift in the ICU, one of the
   doctors utilizes a robot
   to interact with patients remotely from his home. His face appears via
   webcam on a screen and he uses a joystick to move around the unit.

   One night the doctor was broadcasting to a patient from his messy
   kitchen.

   His message was important but his background was distracting to the
   patient and myself; ultimately making this exemplary doctor appear less
   authoritative. That night the Webaround concept was born.

   I became committed to creating a webcam background solution for anyone
   to use, anywhere, at any time. Years later, I continue to perfect the
   design and have progressed from offering only a 42” round Webaround to
   offering 52” round, 52” square and our new 56” portable green screen.

   Along the way my family and friends have helped improve the concept,
   market the brand, handle logistics and make the Webaround what it is
   today. I have developed an international customer base and can proudly
   say that the Webaround has been used on every continent except
   Antarctica!

   I look forward to working with you whether you are a university student
   video chatting with your family or a multi-national company investing
   in webcam enabled face to face customer service—I have a solution for
   you.

   I’ve got your back(ground).

   Sincerely,
   Linda
