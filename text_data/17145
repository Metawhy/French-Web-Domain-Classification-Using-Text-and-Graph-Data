4. Dagje Keukenhof
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ik was er nog nooit geweest…in de Keukenhof. En als ik heel eerlijk ben
   heb ik ook nooit zo de behoefte gevoeld. Maar toen de gelegenheid zich
   voordeed leek het me wel een leuke uitdaging om een heel ander
   onderwerp -bloemen, geen beestjes- eens leuk vast proberen te leggen….
   Tulp in knop From a distance.... Group Ladies in Red Tourism Standing
   out in the Crowd Blue Yelowness Yay, een beestje! Hearts Kievitsbloem
   An Ants Point of View Pretty in White

5. Dancing, Dipping &…Diving. [a White throated Dipper in the Netherlands] 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Past autumn a White-throated Dipper (Cinclus cinclus cinclus) arrived
   in the Netherlands.
   It’s a very rare visitor in our country and it attracted a large
   audience of photographers and twitchers.
   I have never seen so many huge lenses pointed at one little bird.

   To get a more personal shot I tried to descend to bird level.
   Which was a bit scary since the sides of the concrete channel are steep
   and very slippery.
   I kind of anchored myself with my foot in a crack of the concrete and
   hoped for the best.
   Getting wet is one thing but my dive being photographed a 40 times and
   to be seen on the internet forever……no way…..
   I had my fun with this little cooperative birdie and left satisfied and
   dry.

   And then…..there was this cold winter day. The channel was covered with
   snow and it was freezing. I decided a dipper in the snow might be nice
   and I noticed some other photographers had had the same idea.
   So we were lying there….in the snow when all of a sudden one of the men
   started gliding into the water……..
   Just before he could glide to the bottom of the channel I threw away my
   camera, grabbed his hand and somehow got him out….
   His pants were soaked but his 500mm was still dry, so we decided to
   continue our trip together and despite the rather weird first
   impression had a great day…

   But my god…… some people do everything to get that perfect shot…! 😉

       The black and white dipper is Norway’s national bird. They are so
       strange and cute bobbing around in small streams.
       Sounds like you had a cold but exiting day. You got some great
       pictures. Hope you didn’t get a cold as well.
