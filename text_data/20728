Grown Up Strawberry Shortcake Shake March 24, 2017

   Author: Kayleigh Kosmas Cocktails Cold Drinks Food Ice Cream Novelty
   Cocktails Sweet Vodka

   Strawberry Shortcake Shake with Vodka (click through for tutorial) Once
   the weather starts to warm up every year, it’s time to catch up on the
   things I’ve missed all winter long–creamy milkshakes, cold cocktails
   and fresh berries, to name a few! This vodka-laced strawberry milkshake
   just happens to check all those boxes. Oh, and don’t forget the
   shortcake rim... in case you needed one more reason to drop everything
   and make one right now.

   This milkshake cocktail is a breeze to whip up–just throw your berries
   and dairy in a blender. While the shortcake crumbles are getting golden
   and toasty in the oven, don’t forget to whip some fresh cream to top
   the whole thing off! It takes 10-15 minutes to make from start to
   finish and way less time to polish it off. Pro tip: use a straw to to
   get every last drop!

   Strawberry Shortcake Shake with Vodka (click through for tutorial)
   Grown Up Strawberry Shortcake Shake, makes two

   1/2 cup water
   1/2 cup + 1 teaspoon sugar
   1/2 inch slice of shortcake or poundcake
   2 cups strawberries
   1 cup vanilla ice cream
   1/2 cup milk
   3 oz. (2 shots) whipped cream vodka
   1/2 cup whipping cream

   Strawberry Shortcake Shake with Vodka (click through for tutorial) Make
   a simple syrup by dissolving a 1/2 cup of sugar in the water in a small
   saucepan. Bring to a boil and remove from heat to cool. Combine the
   strawberries, ice cream, milk and vodka in a blender, and blend on high
   speed until smooth.

   Strawberry Shortcake Shake with Vodka (click through for tutorial) Chop
   the shortcake into breadcrumb-sized pieces. Toast in an even layer on a
   parchment lined baking sheet in a toaster oven or in a standard oven at
   200º F for 3-4 minutes until golden and slightly dry. Meanwhile, beat
   the whipping cream until it begins to thicken. Add the teaspoon of
   sugar, and then continue beating just until stiff peaks form.

   Strawberry Shortcake Shake with Vodka (click through for tutorial) Add
   a shortcake rim to your glasses by dipping the glasses into a 1/4 inch
   of simple syrup and immediately rolling the rims in the shortcake
   crumbles. Fill the glasses with the strawberry milkshake and top with a
   generous dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a strawberry slice.

How to Write and Pitch a Book Proposal March 23, 2017

   ABM Books ABM Classes Author: Emma Chapman Favorites

   How to write and pitch a book proposal Hi, friends! Today I am REALLY
   excited because we are opening back up our course, How to Write and
   Pitch a Book Proposal, written by our friend and literary agent,
   Lindsay Edgecombe. This course was originally launched in April 2014
   and after re-evaluating, adding some new images, sprucing up the text,
   and just generally giving this course a few updates to make it that
   much better, we are excited to offer it up to you all again.

   This course is designed  to help aspiring authors take their book ideas
   and turn them into A+ proposals that will stand out to both literary
   agents as well as publishers, and hopefully lead to a book deal. How to
   Write and Pitch a Book Proposal is not overly long—but it definitely
   has everything you need. I cannot tell you how much I believe in this
   course, but you don't have to take just my word for it. We were super
   excited when Anuschka Rees, the author of The Curated Closet (a book we
   LOVE), agreed to share her story with you:

   The curated closet "I’ve wanted to write a book ever since I can
   remember, but I never actively pursued a career as a writer because,
   'There are too many jobless writers already' and, 'It’s close to
   impossible to get a book deal these days' – that’s what they say,
   right? It wasn’t until my blog gained some traction (after 3+ years)
   that I started to think, 'Hey, this stuff that I’ve been writing about…
   that would actually make a pretty good book!'

   I started to look around for information about how one might go about
   not just writing a book, but then also about finding someone to publish
   it. I eventually stumbled across Lindsay’s course on A Beautiful Mess,
   read the whole thing in one go–and felt very relieved because I now had
   a concrete roadmap for what I had to do next.

   The course walks you through every component of a great book proposal,
   from your pitch letter to your chapter summaries. Two things surprised
   me initially: for one, that book proposals have a set structure that
   you need to stick to, and secondly, that a huge chunk of it should be
   dedicated to marketing. In other words: You need to present your
   potential publisher with a clear plan of who is going to buy your book
   and what you will do to promote it. Those chapters were definite
   wake-up calls because while I had already meticulously planned out each
   chapter of the book, I had pretty much ignored the entire business side
   of being an author. Thankfully, Lindsay does a great job explaining
   both the creative and the business components of the proposal in detail
   and gives you plenty of ideas for everything. There are also several
   examples from real authors, which I loved, and of course, lots of
   insider tips from Lindsay herself. I also found it very motivating that
   throughout the course, she emphasized that agents and publishers WANT
   to hear great pitches and are rooting for their authors. That little
   bit of extra encouragement made me feel like my proposal wasn’t going
   to end up in the slush pile—at least not if I gave it my best shot.

   When I finished writing my proposal, I first sent it to the same
   literary agency Lindsay works at because I felt like I had already
   gotten to know her and her philosophy through her course. I was going
   to research more literary agents the next week, but guess what? I
   didn’t need to because Lindsay replied, we chatted on the phone, and
   just like that I had found my agent!

   Within a couple of months, Lindsay had negotiated a book deal for me,
   and I could start writing my book! The Curated Closet came out in
   September 2016 in the US and Canada, and is due to be released in
   several more languages. Right now I am working on my next book. This
   time I already have an agent, but I am still going to use Lindsay’s
   course as a guide to fine-tune the overall concept of the book and make
   sure it’s well thought out from both a creative and a business
   perspective."-Anuschka Rees

   How to write a book proposal If you've ever dreamed of writing a book,
   this course can help you shape your ideas and maybe even turn that
   dream into a reality. Here's what you'll learn:

   •How to know if you're ready to pitch your book
   •How to write an awesome pitch letter (sometimes called a query)
   •How to draft an overview of your idea
   •Crafting an attention-getting biography
   •How to think about your potential audience
   •Growing your platform as an author
   •Drafting a great chapter outline

   Lindsay has packed the course with encouragement as well as industry
   insider knowledge from her experiences in the publishing world over the
   past ten years. The course also includes three sample proposals as a
   bonus! Giving you even more guides to follow.

   How to Write and Pitch a Book Proposal is a work-at-your-own-pace
   e-Course, available for $15 USD.

   Lindsay, Emma, Elsie Lindsay has represented Elsie and I for many
   years. She helped us land our very first book deal, and we are
   currently finishing up work on our third book. Not only is Lindsay a
   great agent, she is also a friend, and there is no one else I would
   recommend learning from more. You're going to love her and her course.

Make Any Box Into a Jewelry Box! March 22, 2017

   Author: Laura Gummerman Budget: $$ Crafts D.I.Y. Project Favorites Home
   Decor Homemade Gift Ideas One Day Project Sewing

   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Pretty
   decorative boxes are one of my favorite things to have around the house
   (usually in little groupings with other candles or figurine type
   things). A lot of the time though, I love a box or container, but I'm
   not sure what to actually store in it! It occurred to me that most
   decorative boxes are actually the perfect size to be a jewelry box, and
   with a few quick tweaks, they can be really useful around the house as
   well as pretty!

   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Supplies:
   -decorative box with lid (I used this one, but this one would be great
   too.)
   -1/4 yard velvet fabric (this is a good pink option)
   -straight pins and sewing machine
   -hot glue gun or fabric glue
   -cotton batting
   -fabric scissors
   -cutting mat, rotary cutter, and ruler
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) First
   you'll want to double over your batting and cut a piece that's as wide
   as your box and long enough to make a 1" thick roll when all rolled up.
   If you make them about 1" wide, then you can know how many you need to
   make to fill your box (a 5" wide box would need 5 rolls, etc.).

   Cut and roll all your pieces and pin in place for now.
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Use a
   cloth measuring tape to measure the circumference of your batting rolls
   and add 1/2" to your measurement (this will give you a 1/4" seam
   allowance when you sew it later). Cut your velvet fabric into a
   rectangle that's 1" longer than the length of your batting roll and as
   wide as the circumference width found in the first step above.
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Fold your
   fabric lengthwise (right sides facing each other) and pin in place. Sew
   down the open side with 1/4" seam allowance and turn your velvet tube
   right side out.
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Stuff
   your cotton batting into the tube (don't forget to take that pin out!),
   and repeat the sewing and stuffing process for each batting roll.
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) To close
   the ends, put a dollop of hot glue (or quick dry fabric glue) directly
   onto the middle of the batting end inside the velvet tube and fold the
   bottom of the velvet up into the glue. Add more glue to fold in the
   sides one at a time, and then use a final drop of glue to fold the top
   flap down in place. Repeat process on the other side of the tube, and
   then with each additional tube.
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Place
   your velvet tubes snugly into your box, and you just created a new
   jewelry box!
   Make any box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Make any
   box into a jewelry box! (click through for tutorial) Not gonna lie, I
   love that marble, pink, and gold combo together, but of course you can
   do whatever box or color velvet you like! I have a lot of dainty gold
   stacking rings, so I have to keep ring dishes and boxes all over the
   house or they get lost really fast! As you can see, it's pretty easy to
   make your own jewelry holder with whatever box you happen to love, and
   if you vary the size of the batting rolls, then you can have more or
   less rows to add your jewelry into. Hope this DIY is just what you need
   to keep your space useful and pretty! xo. Laura

Peppermint & Eucalyptus Shower Melts March 22, 2017

   Author: Savannah Wallace Clean Living Favorites Homemade Gift Ideas
   Makeup Style

   Shower Melt DIY Sometimes the closest I get to some spa time is the
   5-10 minutes I slip away to take a shower while the kids are napping.
   It's sacred time, people! ;) Lately I've been trying to think of ways
   to make shower time a "treat yo self" experience. Yummy smelling
   shampoos, fancy masks... but recently I've been loving these little DIY
   shower melts.
   The peppermint and eucalyptus (with a touch of orange) smell SO
   incredibly refreshing and always make me feel more awake and ready for
   my day!
   Shower Melt DIY Supplies:
   -corn starch
   -baking soda
   -witch hazel
   -peppermint, eucalyptus & orange essential oils
   -silicone mold
   -food coloring
   Step One: In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of corn
   starch. Stir.
   Shower Melt DIY Step Two: Slowly add 5 tablespoons of witch hazel to
   your mixture, making sure you get out any lumps. Once combined, add in
   a drop of food coloring. I added a touch of green to give it a minty
   looking color. If your mixture seems a little dry and hard to stir, add
   just a touch more of witch hazel. Finish by adding in 5 drops of
   orange, 10 drops of peppermint and 6 drops of eucalyptus essential oil
   to your shower melts.
   Step Three: Once everything is combined, use a spoon to fill your
   silicone mold. This recipe made 8 small stars.
   Shower Melt DIY Shower Melt DIY Step Four: Put your shower melts in the
   freezer overnight to harden. Keep in a cool place like the fridge to
   prevent them from melting. When you're ready to use your melts, simply
   put them in your shower away from direct water so it can melt slowly. I
   like to put mine on the ledge of the bath in the corner or on a soap
   holder. For a little boost of smell, add an extra 1-2 drops of
   essential oil to your shower melt once it's in the shower. Breathe in
   and enjoy!!
   Shower Melt DIY Shower Melt DIY These make the perfect gift for anyone
   in your life in need of some "me time"! ;) Store or give them in a cute
   jar or bowl, and don't forget to keep them chilled! Lots of love, Sav.

   Supplies:
   -corn starch
   -baking soda
   -witch hazel
   -peppermint, eucalyptus & orange essential oils
   -silicone mold
   -food coloring
   Step One: In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of corn
   starch. Stir.
   Step Two: Slowly add 5 tablespoons of witch hazel to your mixture,
   making sure you get out any lumps. Once combined, add in a drop of food
   coloring. I added a touch of green to give it a minty looking color. If
   your mixture seems a little dry and hard to stir, add just a touch more
   of witch hazel. Finish by adding in 5 drops of orange, 10 drops of
   peppermint and 6 drops of eucalyptus essential oil to your shower
   melts.
   Step Three: Once everything is combined, use a spoon to fill your
   silicone mold. This recipe made 8 small stars.
   Step Four: Put your shower melts in the freezer overnight to harden.
   Keep in a cool place like the fridge to prevent them from melting. When
   you're ready to use your melts, simply put them in your shower away
   from direct water so it can melt slowly. I like to put mine on the
   ledge of the bath in the corner or on a soap holder. For a little boost
   of smell, add an extra 1-2 drops of essential oil to your shower melt
   once it's in the shower. Breathe in and enjoy!!
   These make the perfect gift for anyone in your life in need of some "me
   time"! ;) Store or give them in a cute jar or bowl, and don't forget to
   keep them chilled! Lots of love, Sav.
