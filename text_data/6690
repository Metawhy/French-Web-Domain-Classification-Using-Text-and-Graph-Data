Smoky Avocado Toast with Miso (The Best!)

   This avocado toast recipe is truly the best. But before I get into it,
   let me tell you how it came about.

   I don’t know if I ever told you, but I am a huge bibliophile.

   Yep, I have a deep love for books. I love to read them and I love to
   look at them.

   Just yesterday I spent the entire day nose-deep, reading my latest
   Kindle purchase – The Hacking Of The American Mind – which I highly
   recommend.

   The reason I’m bringing up books is because, not too long ago, I
   purchased Kintsugi Wellness: The Japanese Art of Nourishing Mind, Body,
   and Spirit by Candice Kumai. It’s a beautiful book about Japanese
   traditions and practices for cultivating inner strength and living a
   meaningful life. It’s also packed with yummy recipes, including one I
   fell head over heels in love with:

   Miso avocado toast.

   What can I say other than it’s the best avocado toast recipe I’ve ever
   tasted!

   It’s creamy, savory, salty, simple and so delicious! And then one day I
   decided to add my own twist to it… I sprinkled gochugaru to add
   smokiness and my brain just about exploded.

   Perfection on a plate.

   I’m not kidding when I say that I crave avocado toast all the time now!

   So without further ado, here’s my adaptation of Candice’s amazing miso
   avocado toast recipe.

How To Make Avocado Toast

Ripe avocados

   This is crucial to the success of this recipe. Look for Hass avocados
   and make sure you purchase ripe ones if you are planning on making this
   dish the day of. Otherwise you can leave them on your counter and wait
   a couple of days until they ripen.

   How to tell if an avocado is ripe

   Grab an avocado and give it a gentle squeeze. If it yields a bit, but
   still has a firm-ish texture, you have a good one. You can also check
   by removing the stem of the avocado. If it’s easy to remove and the
   color inside is green, you are good to go.

   I do both to make sure I get the best one available.

Red miso paste is best but you can use white miso if you prefer a sweeter
taste

   I tried both red and white miso paste and I can tell you that there is
   a significant difference in taste. If you would like to know more about
   miso – its origin, different types and health benefits – click here to
   read my post about it.

   For this dish, red miso paste is king.

   Red miso gives the dish a kick of umami, saltiness and earthiness that
   marries beautifully with the other flavors.

   White miso paste on the other hand didn’t marry as well with the
   smashed avocado and gochugaru and tasted quite mild by comparison.

Gochugaru

   Also known as Korean chili flakes, gochugaru is a staple ingredient in
   Korean cooking. It’s often used in sauces and to make kimchi. The
   flakes are smoky and spicy, but not so spicy that you can’t taste
   anything else. Perfect middle ground. You can find gochugaru in Asian
   supermarkets and you can also order it on Amazon.

Multigrain Bread

   This is a really healthy recipe so let’s make it super healthy by using
   multigrain bread 🙂 Seriously though, I love the texture of multigrain
   bread for this recipe because it holds up well against wet ingredients
   like miso paste and smashed avocado.

Is Avocado Toast Healthy?

   Yes, avocado toast is healthy!

   Avocados may be high in fat but 75% of it is unsaturated which is
   basically the good kind of fat.

   That being said, it’s possible to make avocado toast unhealthy
   depending on the ingredients you add to it (i.e. mayonnaise, bacon,
   etc.) and how many slices of it you eat. It’s important to remember
   that no matter how healthy a food is, portion control must always be
   exercised, especially if you are watching your weight.

   As far as this avocado recipe is concerned, I’m happy to report that
   it’s very healthy!

Avocado Toast Variations (Toppings)

   While topping my miso avocado toast with smoky Korean chili flakes is
   by far my favorite flavor combination, sometimes I will jazz it up with
   different ingredients. Here are some of my favorite toppings that pair
   very nicely with the unique flavor of miso.

Avocado Toast with Egg

   Delicious! Topping this dish with a runny egg is something I do when I
   want something a bit more substantial. The egg adds an extra layer of
   creaminess that gives the dish some serious heft and the impression
   that you are eating something naughty.

Avocado Toast with Sliced Tomatoes

   Sweet and bright tomatoes lighten up the dish and give it a summery
   feel. Plus, the vibrant color contrast of green avocado spread against
   sliced red tomatoes makes it easy on the eyes – and hard to resist!

Avocado Toast with Sesame seeds

   Want to add nuttiness to your avocado toast? Then sprinkle some sesame
   seeds on top! The combination of miso paste and sesame seeds gives the
   dish a distinct Japanese flair – as those two ingredients are often
   used together in Japanese cooking.

Avocado Toast with Alfalfa Sprouts

   Give your avocado toast a classic French look by styling it with some
   alfalfa sprouts. The slight bitterness blends nicely with the flavors
   of the dish and the soft crunch adds a clean, garden fresh element.

Avocado Toast with Thai Chilis

   This is not for the faint of heart! If you like spicy foods as much as
   I do then I recommend topping your avocado toast with a Thai chili or
   two. This will add a nice tingle to your lips and the heat will
   intensify with every bite you take. I would even recommend adding a few
   drops of fish sauce (go easy though since fish sauce is very salty) to
   make it even more Thai!

Simple and Delicious

   This smoky avocado toast with miso recipe is exactly that – simple and
   delicious. It’s one of those breakfast dishes that will make you look
   forward to getting up in the morning. Just like a great cup of coffee,
   it’s a wonderful way to start the day!

Smoky Avocado Toast with Miso (The Best!)

   A breakfast that’s so addictive I dream about it every night! Not only
   is this smoky avocado toast with miso recipe simple (5 ingredients) and
   quick (8 minutes total), it’s also packed with goodness and flavors
   that punch way above their weight class!
     * Author: Caroline Phelps
     * Prep Time: 5 minutes
     * Cook Time: 3 minutes
     * Total Time: 8 minutes
     * Yield: 2 1x
     * Category: Breakfast
     * Method: Stove top
     * Cuisine: Vegan

   Scale (BUTTON) 1x (BUTTON) 2x (BUTTON) 3x

Ingredients

     * 1 ripe avocado
     * 2 slices multigrain bread or bread of your choice
     * 2 teaspoons awase, white or red miso paste
     * 1 tablespoon vegan butter
     * 1 teaspoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) optional but highly
       recommended!
     * 2 eggs (optional)

Instructions

    1. Peel the avocado and take out the pit. Mash in a bowl with a fork
       and set aside.
    2. Toast the bread in a toaster until golden brown (I use the #3 on my
       dial).
    3. Spread 1/2 tablespoon butter on one side of each slice and 1
       teaspoon miso paste on the other side.
    4. In a pan over medium high heat, place the bread slices, butter
       side, down. Toast for 1-2 minutes, until you get a nice crispy top,
       and flip the bread over. Toast for 1 minute and transfer to a
       plate.
    5. Spread equal amounts of avocado on each slice and sprinkle
       gochugaru on top.
    6. Season with a little salt if necessary – miso is quite salty on its
       own – and serve.
    7. Optional – serve with an egg on top for a more substantial meal.

Notes

   This recipe is adapted from Candice Kumai’s miso avocado toast.

       Interesting take–I’ll have to give it a try. For those counting
       calories they can also make it using rye crisps which I do all the
       time. With a fried egg this is a perfect way to go!
