            “The ACM SRC was an incredible opportunity for me to present
            my research to a wide audience of experts. I received
            invaluable, supportive feedback about my research and
            presentation style, and I am sure that the lessons I learned
            from the experience will stay with me for the rest of my
            career as a researcher. Participating in the SRC has also made
            me feel much more comfortable speaking to other researchers in
            my field, both about my work as well as projects I am not
            involved in. I would strongly recommend students interested in
            research to apply to an ACM SRC—there’s really no reason not
            to!. ”

   A joint venture of ACM and Microsoft ACM Student Research Competition

   The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC), sponsored by Microsoft,
   offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to
   present their original research at well-known ACM sponsored and
   co-sponsored conferences before a panel of judges and attendees.

About the Student Research Competition

   The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC), sponsored by Microsoft,
   offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to
   present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees
   at well-known ACM-sponsored and co-sponsored conferences.

   Recognizing the value of student participation at conferences, ACM
   started the program in 2003, but it is much more than just a travel
   funding program. The ACM SRC provides participants a chance to meet
   other students and to get direct feedback on their work from experts.

   This year's competitions took place at 26 participating ACM SIG
   conferences, sponsored by SIGACCESS, SIGARCH, SIGCHI, SIGCOMM, SIGCSE,
   SIGDA,SIGDOC, SIGGRAPH, SIGHPC,  SIGMICRO, SIGMOBILE, SIGMOD, SIGOPS,
   SIGPLAN,  SIGSOFT and SIGSPATIAL as well as Grace Hoppper and TAPIA and
   included more than 360 student participants.

   The program is administered by Nanette Hernandez at ACM, Dr. Laurie Ann
   Williams at North Carolina State University, Douglas Baldwin at SUNY
   Geneseo and Dr. Evelyne Viegas at Microsoft, Redmond, WA.

   "VLSI Routing: Seeing Nano Tree in Giga Forest" (ICCAD 2018)

   We are using nanometer-size transistors and Giga Hertz clock frequency
   in very large scale integration (VLSI). Under such extreme conditions,
   timing, power, manufacturability and reliability are all crucial issues
   in VLSI design. For example, 50% – 80% of gates in the high-performance
   integrated circuit (IC) today are repeaters, which do not perform
   useful computation but work for timing closure [40]; over 50% of the
   chip at around 7nm will be powered off and cannot be utilized due to
   the power constraint [26]. .... [Read more]

   "RACE - Recursive Algebraic Coloring Engine" (SC 2018)

   Sparse linear algebra is a key component in many scientific simulations
   ranging from quantum physics to fluid and structural
   mechanics. However, iterative numerical methods and important building
   blocks of sparse linear algebra frequently
   feature strong data dependencies, making them difficult to parallelize.
   Typically, loop-carried dependencies occur in
   iterative solvers (e.g., Kaczmarz, Gauss-Seidel) or preconditioners and
   write conflicts show up in the parallelization
   of building blocks such as symmetric sparse
   matrix-vector multiplication. Scalable, hardware-efficient
   parallelization of
   such methods and kernels is known to be a challenge... [Read more]

   "Empirical Assessment of Software Documentation Strategies: A
   Randomized Controlled Trial" (SIGCSE 2019)

   Source code documentation is an important part of teaching students how
   to be effective programmers. But what evidence do we
   have to support what good documentation looks like? This study utilizes
   a randomized controlled trial to experimentally compare
   several different types of documentation, including traditional
   comments, self-documenting naming, and an automatic documentation
   generator. The results of this experiment show that the
   relationship between documentation and source code understanding is
   more
   complex than simply "more is better," and poorly documented code may
   even lead to a more correct understanding of the source code... [Read

   "DALS: Delay-driven Approximate Logic Synthesis" (ICCAD 2018)

   As modern VLSI designs encompass more complexity and
   transistortechnology reaches nanoscale, it has been increasingly
   difficult to improve the performance and energy consumption of circuits
   by conventional design methods [18]. On the other hand, many recent
   applications, including image rendering, signal processing, speech
   recognition and machine learning, are error tolerant by their nature.
   Their error tolerance is caused by various reasons. For example, some
   of them are resilient to input noises. Some of them have outputs
   intended for human perception and can tolerate errors imperceptible to
   users. Others do not offer a unique answer and a variety of answers are
   acceptable. These classes of applications can tolerate inexact
   computation in substantial portions of their execution [3]. Under this
   circumstance, approximate computing was proposed as a novel circuit
   design paradigm [4].... Read more

   "An Intelligent and Interactive Route Planning Maker for Deploying New
   Transportation Services" (SIGSPATIAL 2018)

   Planning Maker (RPM) is proposed to help governments or transportation
   companies to plan new route services in the city. The function of RPM
   is four-fold. First, RPM illustrates the local characteristics (e.g.
   geo-graphical information or spatial-temporal urban informatics) by
   visualizing multiple aspects of the city for users to easily understand
   the local characteristics of anywhere in the city, which is beneficial
   for proposing new routes. Second, RPM has a flexible user interface
   that allows users to arbitrarily sketch/adjust their idea by
   adding/removing routes and stations when deploying new routes. Besides,
   RPM can also show the existing routes which are correlated with the new
   route to let users check their transference or overlapping regions.
   Third, RPM provides an intelligent function to estimate passenger flows
   (PF) in certain time intervals and acquire relevant urban information
   so that the user can estimate the effectiveness of designed
   routes... [Read more]

   "Your Story Recorded in a Magnet: Micromagnetic Simulations of
   Spin-Orbit Torque in Multi-layer Structures" (TAPIA 2018)

   The aim of this work is to address one of the challenges in computing:
   the need for novel energyefficient non-volatile memory devices which
   have the potential of drastically reducing power consumption
   by computers, mobile, wearable and embedded electronics. Such memory
   devices would require zero power to maintain their state and have the
   ability to start up processes instantaneously. In this
   micromagnetic simulation study, we demonstrate switching
   (write-operation) of a magnetic memory unit with Spin-Orbit Torque, not
   requiring external magnetic field. We propose a novel multi-layer
   stack which is comprised of a Synthetic Antiferromagnet (SAF) and an
   antiferromagnetic underlayer (AFM). Efficient field-free magnetization
   reversal is propelled by the competing exchange fields and
   spin torques. In addition, we perform an optimization analysis of the
   parameter space required for deterministic switching. Our simulation
   results provide a promising approach for developing efficient
   and stable switching schemes and designing actual devices for future
   spintronic applications.... [Read more]
