Description

   The WP-Members membership plugin turns your WordPress site into a
   membership site. Restrict premium content, create custom registration
   fields, and more.

Membership Sites. Simplified.

   You need a membership site, but you want to focus on your business, not
   mastering a plugin. WP-Members is simple to use, easy to set up, yet
   flexible in every way imaginable.

   The plugin restricts selected WordPress content to registered site
   members. WP-Members puts the registration process on the site front end
   so it is part of your content instead of the native WP login page.
   WP-Members requires no modifications to your theme while remaining
   scalable for users who want to customize the look and feel, or want to
   restrict only some content. It is a great tool for sites offering
   premium content to subscribers and is adaptable to a variety of
   applications.

   Simple to install and configure – yet customizable and scalable!

Fonctionnalités :

     * Restrict or hide posts, pages, and custom post types
     * User login, registration, and profile integrated into your theme
     * Login widget
     * Create custom registration and profile fields
     * Notifier l’administrateur d’une nouvelle inscription
     * Hold new registrations for admin approval
     * Create post excerpt teaser content automatically
     * Shortcodes for login, registration, content restriction, and more
     * Create powerful customizations with more than 120 action and filter
       hooks
     * A library of API functions for extensibility

   WP-Members allows you to restrict content as restricted or hidden,
   limiting access to registered users.

   A full Users Guide is available here. The guide outlines the
   installation process, and also documents how to use all of the
   settings.

Installation

   WP-Members is designed to run « out-of-the-box » with no modifications
   to your WP installation necessary. Please follow the installation
   instructions below. Most of the support issues that arise are a result
   of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions.

Basic Install:

   The best way to begin is to review the Initial Setup Video. There is
   also a complete Users Guide available that covers all of the plugin’s
   features in depth.
    1. Upload the /wp-members/ directory and its contents to the
       /wp-content/plugins/ directory
    2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress®

   You are ready to begin using WP-Members. Now follow the instructions
   titled « Locking down your site » below.

Locking down your site:

     * To restrict posts, you will need to use the <!--more--> link in
       your posts. Content above to the « more » split will display on
       summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be
       required to login to view the entire post. You may also use the
       plugin’s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts
       automatically. If you do not use the « more » tag or the auto
       excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive
       templates, unless the post is marked as hidden.
     * To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for
       pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the <!--more--> link is not
       necessary in the blocking of pages, but must be used if you have
       the « show excerpts » setting turned on for pages.
     * To protect comments, we recommend setting « Users must be
       registered and logged in to comment » under Settings > Discussion.
     * On the Settings > General page, it is recommended that you uncheck
       « Anyone can register ». While not required, this will prevent WP’s
       native registration from colliding with WP-Members, especially if
       you are using any of the WP-Members additional registration fields.
     * Under Settings > Reading, « For each article in a feed, show » is
       recommended to be set to « Summary. » WordPress installs with full
       feed settings by default. If you don’t change this, your feeds will
       show full content.

Additional Setup Information

   There are also some special pages that can be created with simple
   shortcodes:
     * A User Profile page where registered members can edit their
       information and change/reset their password: [wpmem_profile]
     * A Registration page available for those that need a specific URL
       for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing
       pages). Note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can
       also be included by default on blocked content pages: [wpmem_form
       register]
     * A Login page. This is also an optional page as the login form is
       included by default on blocked content. But if you need a specific
       login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode:
       [wpmem_form login]
     * And more shortcodes are available!

   Powerful cusotmizations can be constructed with over 120 action and
   filter hooks, as well as user accessible functions.

Excellent plugin, excellent support.

   ihopethiswillfi 15 août 2019
   Excellent plugin, excellent support.

Chrome plus this plugin disabled site…

   ralphw 23 août 2019
   In Firefox, all is well. In Chrome, however, (both on laptop and phone
   browser), all menu links led to just one page, and a second-level page,
   at that. It also blew apart the formatting of the Contact 7 Form on
   that page. I disabled all plugins, changed themes, and this plugin was
   the culprit. Cheers! ----8/23/19 Follow-Up---- Point taken, Chad...! As
   said initially, despite changing themes for troubleshooting, and by
   this I mean using the plain vanilla WP "Twenty Sixteen" theme, your
   plugin was not playing well with my site when viewed with Chrome. As I
   found another plugin to suit me for those needs, and as I did not have
   the time or interest to experiment to see if one of my 16 other
   activated plugins was the cause of making your plugin not work in
   Chrome, I wrote the above review from a sense of frustration. I did not
   intend to nuke your stats! So, adjustment made, and hopefully I am the
   only one that this issue ever happens to. Cheers, Ralph

Very good plugin and awesome support

WP-Members Membership Plugin

   Par Chad Butler

Description

   The WP-Members membership plugin turns your WordPress site into a
   membership site. Restrict premium content, create custom registration
   fields, and more.

Membership Sites. Simplified.

   You need a membership site, but you want to focus on your business, not
   mastering a plugin. WP-Members is simple to use, easy to set up, yet
   flexible in every way imaginable.

   The plugin restricts selected WordPress content to registered site
   members. WP-Members puts the registration process on the site front end
   so it is part of your content instead of the native WP login page.
   WP-Members requires no modifications to your theme while remaining

Installation

   WP-Members is designed to run « out-of-the-box » with no modifications
   to your WP installation necessary. Please follow the installation
   instructions below. Most of the support issues that arise are a result
   of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions.

Basic Install:

   The best way to begin is to review the Initial Setup Video. There is
   also a complete Users Guide available that covers all of the plugin’s
   features in depth.
    1. Upload the /wp-members/ directory and its contents to the
       /wp-content/plugins/ directory
    2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress®

   You are ready to begin using WP-Members. Now follow the instructions
   titled « Locking down your site » below.

Locking down your site:

     * To restrict posts, you will need to use the <!--more--> link in
       your posts. Content above to the « more » split will display on
       summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be
       required to login to view the entire post. You may also use the
       plugin’s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts
       automatically. If you do not use the « more » tag or the auto
       excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive
       templates, unless the post is marked as hidden.
     * To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for
       pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the <!--more--> link is not
       necessary in the blocking of pages, but must be used if you have
       the « show excerpts » setting turned on for pages.
     * To protect comments, we recommend setting « Users must be
       registered and logged in to comment » under Settings > Discussion.
     * On the Settings > General page, it is recommended that you uncheck
       « Anyone can register ». While not required, this will prevent WP’s
       native registration from colliding with WP-Members, especially if
       you are using any of the WP-Members additional registration fields.
     * Under Settings > Reading, « For each article in a feed, show » is
       recommended to be set to « Summary. » WordPress installs with full
       feed settings by default. If you don’t change this, your feeds will
       show full content.

Additional Setup Information

   There are also some special pages that can be created with simple
   shortcodes:
     * A User Profile page where registered members can edit their
       information and change/reset their password: [wpmem_profile]
     * A Registration page available for those that need a specific URL
       for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing
       pages). Note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can
       also be included by default on blocked content pages: [wpmem_form
       register]
     * A Login page. This is also an optional page as the login form is
       included by default on blocked content. But if you need a specific
       login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode:
       [wpmem_form login]
     * And more shortcodes are available!

   Powerful cusotmizations can be constructed with over 120 action and
   filter hooks, as well as user accessible functions.

Excellent plugin, excellent support.

   ihopethiswillfi 15 août 2019
   Excellent plugin, excellent support.

Chrome plus this plugin disabled site…

   ralphw 23 août 2019
   In Firefox, all is well. In Chrome, however, (both on laptop and phone
   browser), all menu links led to just one page, and a second-level page,
   at that. It also blew apart the formatting of the Contact 7 Form on
   that page. I disabled all plugins, changed themes, and this plugin was
   the culprit. Cheers! ----8/23/19 Follow-Up---- Point taken, Chad...! As
   said initially, despite changing themes for troubleshooting, and by
   this I mean using the plain vanilla WP "Twenty Sixteen" theme, your
   plugin was not playing well with my site when viewed with Chrome. As I
   found another plugin to suit me for those needs, and as I did not have
   the time or interest to experiment to see if one of my 16 other
   activated plugins was the cause of making your plugin not work in
   Chrome, I wrote the above review from a sense of frustration. I did not
   intend to nuke your stats! So, adjustment made, and hopefully I am the
   only one that this issue ever happens to. Cheers, Ralph

Very good plugin and awesome support

   faycan 12 juin 2019

   profoundworks 23 mai 2019
   This plugin works very nicely, but the best part is the support. Chad
   is one of the most helpful plugin developers we have ever come across,
   and is always happy to help us even with customisations to certain
   features. Highly recommended.

Excellent

Support premium

   The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO
   plugin on the WordPress.org forums, as we prioritize our email support.
   One-on-one email support is available to people who bought Yoast SEO
   Premium only.

   Notez bien que Yoast SEO Premium (en anglais) dispose de nombreuses
   fonctionnalités supplémentaires, incluant le fait de disposer de
   synonymes et de phrases-clés similaires, de suggestions de liens
   internes, de contenus essentiels et d’un gestionnaire de redirection,
   alors cet investissement vaut le coup !

   Vous pouvez consulter Yoast Local SEO (en anglais), Yoast News SEO (en
   anglais) et Yoast Video SEO (en anglais) pour Yoast SEO. Ils marchent
   avec la version gratuite de Yoast SEO et évidemment le support est
   inclus pour les extensions premium.

       sitemaps.

Ne prenez aucun risque avec vos sauvegardes

   Your WordPress backups are worth the entire investment you’ve made in
   your website. The day may come when you get hacked, when something goes
   wrong with an update, your server crashes or your hosting company goes
   bust – without good backups, you lose everything. Would you entrust all
   your hard work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads,
   mixed reviews or no professional support?

   Believe us: writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently
   across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

   UpdraftPlus works. We’ll keep your backups safe.

Why you should backup your website.

   WordPress like any CMS can be vulnerable to things such as server
   crashes, hacking, security flaws, bad plugin or theme updates and
   insecure web hosts. If anything happened to your website, it would cost
   you dearly in time, money and reputation.

   Whilst other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate
   insurance: they mean that, if the worst were to happen, your website
   (plus all related files and databases) stay safe, and can be restored
   in no time.

   You could always create your own manual backups- but using backup
   plugin is infinitely quicker, simpler and safer. Life’s busy enough!
   With UpdraftPlus, you can simply « set and forget », scheduling in
   automatic backups to save you time, work and hassle.

How UpdraftPlus compares with other backup plugins:

   UpdraftPlus is the most highly-rated and popular plugin out there – and
   for good reason. Not only is it comprehensive in terms of its features,
   but it’s aso easy and intuitive to use. And because it has such a vast
   user base, it’s tried and tested in a whole range of different
   situations and scenarios.

   Unlike many other plugins, UpdraftPlus:
     * Restores, as well as backing up
     * Backs up to more cloud options than any others
     * Allows you to set up automatic backup schedules, for the ultimate
       in convenience
     * Is faster, using up fewer server resources
     * Has been tested on over 1 million sites

   Nous avons une page de comparaison entre notre version premium et la
   concurrence sur notre site.

   location. It’s called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2 different
   forms:
     * UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted)

Instantly create a temporary clone of your site (UpdraftClone)

   A temporary clone is an instant copy of this website, running on our
   servers. You don’t need to test or develop on your live site; instead,
   you can UpdraftClone it, and throw away your clone when done. Learn
   more about UpdraftClone here.
     * Easy: Press the buttons… UpdraftClone does the work.
     * Reliable: Runs on capacity from a leading cloud computing provider.
     * Secure: One VPS (Virtual Private Server) per clone, shared with
       nobody.
     * Fast: Takes just the time needed to create a backup and send it.
     * Flexible: If you want, test upgrading to a different PHP or WP
       version.

   To create a temporary clone you need: 1) credit in your account and 2)
   to connect to your account. You can buy UpdraftClone tokens from our
   shop, here.

          Here: https://updraftplus.com/faqs/ (by keeping them in one
          place, we make sure they don’t fall out-of-date!).

   Is there any way to make managing multiple website backups easier?
          Yes! We’ve developed a brilliant new plugin that allows you to
          backup, update and manage all of your website remotely from one
          central location. It’s called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2
          different forms:

          + UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted)
          + UpdraftCentral Premium (fully-hosted by us and
            « ready-to-go »; self-hosted version also available)

   What if I have a problem / need support ?
          You can find us in the WordPress support forum for this plugin.
          However, before you get in touch with problems, please do ensure
          that you read through all the FAQs and that you’ve updated to
          the latest release of our plugin. If you’re a paying customer,
          you should go to our support page, here.

          It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much
          other information as possible in your report, for example, the
          PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to
          the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have
          installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

          To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on
          the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing
          that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it
          there.

          If you know how, please send your PHP error logs- just the few
          lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called
          error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can
          check via FTP. And if you’re a programmer that can debug and
          send a patch, that’s even better.

   UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it’s trying to backup, after I have
          left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do?
          This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of
          resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from
          ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right
          from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at
          once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more
          reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the “Expert
          settings” and reducing the size at which zip files are split.
          UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run
          into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not
          resource-starved.

   If my site gets hacked and the backups don’t work, is there anything I
          can do?
          Unfortunately not; since this is free software, there’s no
          warranty and no guarantee. It’s up to you to verify that
          UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly.

       user enables the ‘Add this website to UpdraftCentral’ option in the
       Premium/Extensions tab
     * TWEAK: During a restore send structured data to the front end. This

       thereby reducing the need for stand-alone polls
     * TWEAK: If FTP settings were removed and an attempt was made to

       an unclear error shown, instead of just showing a clear error.
     * TWEAK: For premium users: Added the option to connect to
       UpdraftCentral Cloud at point of connecting a license to a site
     * TWEAK: If on PHP 5.3 or later, then register our Google SPL
       auto-loader with the ‘prepend’ flag, so that we can avoid loading

       credentials if needing the WP_Filesystem API to delete old
       directories

       file
     * TWEAK: Refactor the remote storage logging code in all remote
       storage modules

       plugin’s settings pages
     * FEATURE: UpdraftPlus can now catch backups that don’t complete

       sent about them
     * FIX: If a very large UpdraftVault upload took more than an hour,
       then the token could expire without being refreshed (fix in version
       1.16.0 was incomplete)
     * PERFORMANCE: Modify a condition in the zip-batching algorithm so
       that greater acceleration in the zip-batching algorithm is allowed
       on setups allowing very long PHP run times on the initial
       (zero-eth) resumption
     * PERFORMANCE: UpdraftClone now sends larger chunks over the network,
       leading to faster sending of data
     * PERFORMANCE: Force UpdraftClone to use a 100MB split size for
       better performance (previously intended, but not always working)
     * TWEAK: Upon restoration, WP’s cache directory will be emptied (by
       default it is not included in backups, so in theory this is a
       no-op, but the occasional case has been seen where it got populated
       during the restore process)
     * TWEAK: Add support for the new Europe (Stockholm) (eu-north-1) AWS
       region in Amazon S3
     * TWEAK: Advise the user if they changed the plugin’s slug (and so
       won’t be able to get updates) (paid versions)
     * TWEAK: Make use of wp_get_themes rather than relying solely to
       get_themes which is already deprecated
     * TWEAK: Regression: When a user aborted a fatal error occurred
       before all clean-up actions were complete

1.16.5 – 28/Jan/2019

     * FEATURE: If a restoration is interrupted (e.g. PHP timeout), then
       the « Continue » feature can now resume not just at the most recent
       zip file, but within the zip file at the point it had reached
       (https://updraftplus.com/auto-resuming-interrupted-restores-part-2/
       )
     * FEATURE: Added command in WP-CLI which gives a list of incremental
       backups restore points.
     * FIX: Regression: When a Dropbox upload failed to complete,
       UpdraftPlus would log this but fail to retry
     * FIX: Again update phpseclib to the latest version which should now
       fix the ‘SSH2 Server Host Key Algorithm Mismatch’ on all installs

     * TWEAK: Only add the JavaScript for the incremental schedule
       selection on the UD settings page

       paid API key

       message

1.16.4 – 17/Jan/2019

     * FIX: Regression: Properly mark backups picked up via « Rescan
       remote storage » as non-native (preventing unwelcome side-effects
       such as being pruned by another site)
     * FIX: Correctly update the OneDrive refresh token to prevent expiry
     * FIX: Again work around an issue with ‘SSH2 Server Host Key
       Algorithm Mismatch’ occurring with the current phpseclib release by
       temporarily reverting to an earlier one as it still does not work
       on all installs
     * FIX: When restoring an incremental backup set via WP-CLI, the
       selected restore point was ignored
     * FIX: If the remote storage settings were for multiple instances of
       a single backend-type (e.g. two Dropbox accounts), and if the
       entire backup and send operation completed in a single PHP process,
       then the local copy of the files would not be deleted
     * TWEAK: Show the error message if mbstring.func_overload is turned
       on in php.ini while creating migration key
     * TWEAK: Added Azure China endpoint
     * TWEAK: Resolve « dashicons » CSS conflict

       updraftplus_exclude_directory filters to also pass the stored names
     * TWEAK: Add a new constant UPDRAFTPLUS_ZIP_BATCH_CEILING that can
       tweak internals of the zip backup engine

1.16.3 – 10/Jan/2019

     * FIX: Prevent extraction regression (in 1.16.1) when using PclZip
       (N.B. php-zip is always preferred if installed) on zero-sized files
     * FIX: Prevent the incremental backup cron from being incorrectly
       scheduled

1.16.2 – 07/Jan/2019

     * FIX: wp_doing_cron() was used when unzipping, but requires WP 4.8+
       (regression in 1.16.1, which was never released on wordpress.org)
     * TWEAK: Updated phpseclib to the latest version after the previous
       work around to fix the ‘SSH2 Server Host Key Algorithm Mismatch’
       issue

       sure it is not prematurely purged

     * FIX: If a very large UpdraftVault upload took more than an hour,
       then the token could expire without being refreshed

       creating the manifest file on an incremental backup under certain
       circumstances
     * FIX: When restoring an incremental backup set via WP-CLI, the
       restore order could be wrong
     * TWEAK: Accept and parse the invalid JSON when restoring an
       incremental archive created on 2.16.0
     * TWEAK: When running an incremental backup, the backup report would
       report the time taken to run the backup wrongly
     * TWEAK: Make the logging on the state of zip extraction more
       fine-grained (at least every 100MB, 1000 files or 15 seconds)
     * TWEAK: Re-factoring of zip extraction code to allow for future
       improvements
     * TWEAK: Re-factoring of the restore routines to share more code
       between different entry points, and allow future improvements
     * TWEAK: Differentiate between failures to JSON-decode an incremental
       backup manifest file and other types of failures

1.16.0 – 19/Dec/2018

     * FEATURE: Added the abilty to create and restore Incremental Backups
       (Premium version)

       queries (previously one for each backup) when loading the settings
       page
     * TWEAK: internal backup extradata parameter to prevent unwanted PHP
       notices
     * TWEAK: Fork a method UpdraftPlus_Filesystem_Functions::unzip_file()
       to allow for future enhancements
     * TWEAK: Periodic purging of obsolete job data that didn’t get
       cleaned when expected was not happening on multisite
     * TWEAK: Improve logging when the initial call to jobdata_set_multi
       fails
     * TWEAK: Any stored backup/restore progress log files will now be
       deleted after 40 days. (Since they are attached to email reports,
       you can keep and retrieve them from those if needed). Over-ride
       this with the filter updraftplus_log_delete_age if desired.

1.15.7 – 06/Dec/2018

       the processing of results from a licensing claim
     * TWEAK: (Paid versions) A regression had caused the current UD
       install version to be sent in an updates check
     * TWEAK: Re-factoring of scheduling methods into their own class
     * TWEAK: Tweak the scheduling engine to separate the next resumption
       time from the maximum run time in the case of overlapping runs, in

       of the same type, order the attempts

1.13.8 – 21/Sep/2017

     * FEATURE: When importing a database, warn the user if the current
       MySQL server does not support a used character set, and offer to
       replace it (with a link explaining the risks)
     * FEATURE: Generic S3 storage module can now use non-default ports

     * TWEAK: Some enhancements to the S3 internals, to make the « S3
       Generic » module behave better (it already worked) with the

       backups in future

       the situation clearer

       widely
     * TWEAK: Do not duplicate remote instance ID records in the backup

     * TWEAK: Fix some wrongly-called translation functions, and pull more
       known strings into the Premium version
     * TWEAK: Remove the legacy parameter for setting storage upload job
       status data (only useful for version downgrades of more than 1
       release during in-progress backups)
     * TWEAK: Exclude some unnecessary build and unused files from the
       release zip (reduce disk space and download size)

1.13.6 – 05/Sep/2017

       registered app for easier connections to Google Drive.

       (https://updraftcentral.com) Google Analytics management facility

     * TWEAK: Added custom backup message parameter backupnow_message in
       function updraft_backupnow_inpage_go()
     * TWEAK: General code tidy-up, making older code conform to our
       current standards
     * TWEAK: Add the possibility of passing back associated data with
       test results, and log it in the browser console
     * TWEAK: When carrying out a remote storage test, pass the state of

     * TWEAK: Removed « Reduced Redundancy » storage class from Amazon S3
       remote storage options, because Amazon are deprecating it (and it

       https://updraftplus.com/forums/topic/amazon-is-phasing-out-reduced-
       redundancy-storage/)
     * TWEAK: Backup files missing error message corrected

     * TWEAK: Update plugin-updates-checker library to current (4.2), and
       manage via composer, replacing bundled copy in the build source
     * TWEAK: Replace uses of create_function(), which is deprecated on
       PHP 7.2
     * TWEAK: Replace deprecated constructors (PHP 7+) in webdav module
     * TWEAK: Documentation showing plugin developers how easy it is to
       add in-page backups to their plugin:

     * TWEAK: Make the UpdraftCentral updates checking able to cope with a
       wider range of third-party schemes
     * TWEAK: General code tidy-up, making older code conform to our
       current standards
     * TWEAK: Minor version updates of some bundled libraries
     * TWEAK: Produce and use minified resources (CSS/JS) where available
     * TWEAK: Update class-udrpc to latest (1.4.14) which removes a
       conflict with other code that may interact with CORS OPTIONS
       requests
     * TWEAK: Escape log lines when sending for display (theoretically an
       XSS security issue, but to achieve a successful attack, someone
       would have to first get something malicious into the log file,
       which is difficult as there are not many places where foreign input
       can end up in the log file – e.g. hack into Dropbox and cause
       Dropbox to send you back malicious HTML in an error message – and
       then be able to persuade you to both take a backup triggering the
       problem and then view the log file in your WP dashboard)
     * TWEAK: Update Google Cloud bucket locations

1.13.4 – 08/Jun/2017

     * FIX: Import function had a regression and was not coping with all

       the user

     * FIX: Revert Dropbox authentication change in 1.13.2, which was not
       working on all sites

1.13.2 – 07/Jun/2017

     * TWEAK: Marked as tested and compatible on WordPress 4.8
     * TWEAK: Dropbox authentication flow can now use POST for the final
       step, side-stepping (arbitrary) parameter length restrictions on
       some Apache mod_security setups
     * TWEAK: Prevent a possible PHP notice when curl is not present
     * TWEAK: Point Clef users towards Keyy
     * TWEAK: Do not open an alert box when the user changes their site ID
       in ‘Advanced Tools’
     * TWEAK: Fix parameters to updraft_check_overduecrons() JS function

1.13.1 – 09/May/2017

     * REFACTOR: Completed re-factoring of the remote storage modules, so
       that now all remote storage code has completed this current stage
       of re-factoring (more to come in future – laying the foundation for
       a significant new feature)
     * FIX: Added a nonce to the Dropbox deauth link. This is a minor
       security issue – someone personally targetting you, who knew that
       you were logged in to your WordPress admin, and who could persuade
       you to visit a personally-crafted web page, could cause the
       connection between UpdraftPlus and your Dropbox to be broken. The
       only impact of this is that the sending of your next backup to
       Dropbox would fail, and you would be alerted about the need to
       re-connect.
     * FIX: Import settings now handle the new remote storage options
       format
     * FIX: The zip file browser was not working in free versions
     * TWEAK: Added a version check when saving settings to prevent errors
       or lost settings
     * TWEAK: ‘Existing Backups’ table now shows an icon for each remote
       destination that the backup was sent to
     * TWEAK: Update SSL CA certificates file
     * TWEAK: If, when uploading to S3, a file is not found, handle it
       slightly more elegantly
     * TWEAK: Work with some WebDAV servers that previously sent empty
       responses to OPTIONS requests

1.12.40 – 01/Apr/2017

     * TWEAK: The in-page log file display had stopped continuously
       updating in 1.12.32
     * FIX: In some circumstances, settings for the storage modules
       refactored in 1.12.37 could fail to show
     * FIX: The free version of 1.12.37/38 in some circumstances could
       fail to complete Dropbox authentication

1.12.38 – 31/Mar/2017

     * TWEAK: Dropbox API v2 call to de-authorise a token was failing
     * FIX: Prevent a fatal error when attempting to use a backup method
       with no options set

       dashboard, and (with Premium) download individual files from it
     * FIX: Fix an issue that could occasionally cause corruption of
       interrupted Dropbox backups. All Dropbox users are recommended to
       update asap.
     * TWEAK: Remove debugging statement inadvertently left in 1.12.36
     * TWEAK: Re-factored remote storage handlers via add-ons so that
       there was a cleaner and more consistent class hierarchy
       (preparation for future improvements). N.B. If you subsequently
       downgrade to an older version of UpdraftPlus, you will need to
       re-enter the settings for some remote storage options.
     * TWEAK: List of checksum algorithms run over backups and logged now
       includes SHA256, and is filterable (SHA1 now considered deprecated)
     * TWEAK: Allow chunked database encryption to try and resume in the
       event of an error
     * TWEAK: Improve the premium/extension tab content
     * TWEAK: Fix an issue whereby the UpdraftVault settings section could
       show a bogus problem with checking quota immediately after initial
       setup
     * TWEAK: When requesting a download, work around buggy browser/server
       that continued after Connection: close
     * TWEAK: Improve the UI experience when downloading a log file for
       display fails
     * TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice if another plugin cancels a cron event
     * TWEAK: Tweak semaphore handling and enhance logging

    4. The plugin will automatically update your sitemap of you publish a
       post, so there is nothing more to do 🙂

FAQ

   Where can I find the options page of the plugin?
          It is under Settings > XML Sitemap. I know nowadays many plugins
          add top-level menu items, but in most of the cases it is just
          not necessary. I’ve seen WP installations which looked like an
          Internet Explorer ten years ago with 20 toolbars installed. 😉

   Do I have to create a sitemap.xml and sitemap.xml.gz by myself?
          Not anymore. Since version 4, these files are dynamically
          generated. There must be no sitemap.xml or sitemap.xml.gz in
          your site directory anymore! The plugin will try to rename them
          to sitemap.xml.bak if they still exists.

   Does this plugin use static files or « I can’t find the sitemap.xml
          file! »
          Not anymore. Since version 4, these files are dynamically
          generated just like any other WordPress content.

   There are no comments yet (or I’ve disabled them) and all my postings
          have a priority of zero!
          Please disable automatic priority calculation and define a
          static priority for posts.

   So many configuration options… Do I need to change them?
          No, only if you want to. Default values are ok for most sites.

   Does this plugin work with all WordPress versions?
          This version works with WordPress 3.3 and better. If you’re
          using an older version, please check the Google Sitemaps Plugin
          Homepage for the legacy releases. There is a working release for
          every WordPress version since 1.5, but you really should
          consider updating your WordPress installation!

   My question isn’t answered here
          Most of the plugin options are described at the plugin homepage
          as well as the dedicated Google Sitemaps FAQ.

   My question isn’t even answered there
          Please post your question at the WordPress support forum and tag
          your post with « google-sitemap-generator ».

   What’s new in the latest version?
          The changelog is maintained here

   Why is the changelog on a separate page and not here?
          The WordPress.org repository is just another place to download
          this plugin. I don’t want to maintain too many pages with the
          same content. Thank you for your understanding!

Useless

   Hassan 19 août 2019
   It is beyond my understanding how this plugin has all stars. It does
   not work and the site map it provides, is read by google as having
   literally zero pages on your website.

Russian language?

   grave14 9 août 2019
   There is no Russian language, therefore there is more harm from this
   plugin than benefit. Complicated. And Google translator does not help.

Removes/skips WPML language

   alfadelta 21 juillet 2019
   I thought the plugin was a 5 star but now I realize that the plugin
   skips the WPML language. While in the debug screen i read for example
   /nl/contact in the XML there is /contact.

simple and superior

   hanfarm 19 juillet 2019

     * WordPress 2.0 (Beta, RC1) compatible
     * Added different priority calculation modes and introduced an API to
       create custom ones (Some people didn’t like the way to calculate
       the post priority based on the count of user comments. This will
       give you the possibility to develop custom priority providers which
       fit your needs.)
     * Added support to use the Popularity Contest plugin by Alex King to
       calculate post priority (If you are already using the Popularity
       Contest plugin, this will be the best way to determine the priority
       of the posts. Uses to new priority API noted above.)

     * Posts and pages marked for publish with a date in the future won’t
       be included

       (If you are using external software which directly writes into the
       database without using the WordPress API, you can rebuild the
       sitemap with a simple HTTP Request. This can be made with a cron
       job for example.)
     * Improved compatibility with other plugins (There should no longer
       be problems with other plugins now which checked for existence of a
       specified function to determine if you are in the control panel or
       not.)
     * Recoded plugin architecture which is now fully OOP (The code is now
       cleaner and better to understand which makes it easier to modify.
       This should also avoid namespace problems.)
     * Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages
       are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not
       every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every
       request.)
     * Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the
       config? You’ll need just one click to restore all settings.)
     * Added log file to check everything is running (In the new log
       window you can see when your sitemap was rebuilt or if there was
       any error.)
     * Improved user-interface
     * Added several links to homepage and support (This includes the
       Notify List about new releases and the WordPress support forum.)

       of the user interface and modified the script to support it! Thanks

       WordPress.

       by Brad)

Description

   Cette extension recherchera dans votre site les liens cassés et vous
   avertira si elle en trouve.

   Fonctionnalités
     * Surveille les liens dans vos articles, pages, commentaires, liste
       de liens et champs personnalisés (facultatif).
     * Détecte les liens qui ne fonctionnent plus, les images manquantes
       et les redirections.
     * Notifications sur le Tableau de bord ou par e-mail.
     * Modifie l’affichage des liens cassés dans votre site (facultatif).
     * Empêche les moteurs de recherche de suivre les liens cassés
       (facultatif).
     * Vous pouvez rechercher et filtrer les liens par URL, texte de
       l’ancre et plus encore.
     * Les liens peuvent être modifiés directement depuis la page de
       l’extension, sans avoir à modifier chaque article manuellement.
     * Hautement configurable.

   Utilisation de base

   Une fois installée, l’extension commencera à parcourir vos articles,
   liens (blogroll) et les autres contenus à la recherche de liens. En
   fonction de la taille de votre site, cela peut prendre quelques minutes
   comme plusieurs heures. Quand la recherche est terminée, l’extension va
   tester chaque lien pour vérifier que celui-ci est correct. De nouveau,
   le temps que cela prendra dépend de votre site et du nombre de liens
   trouvés. Vous pouvez suivre cette analyse et modifier les options
   d’analyse dans Réglages -> Vérificateur de lien

   Les liens cassés, si l’extension en trouve, seront affichés dans un
   nouveau menu du panneau d’administration Outils -> Liens cassés. Une
   notification sera aussi affichée dans le Tableau de bord avec le widget
   « Broken Link Checker ». Pour gagner de la place, vous pouvez maintenir
   le widget fermé et le configurer pour qu’il s’affiche uniquement quand
   des liens cassés sont trouvés. La notification par e-mail doit être
   activée séparément (dans Réglages -> Vérificateur de liens).

   L’onglet « Liens cassés » affichera par défaut une liste des liens
   cassés qui ont été trouvés jusqu’à maintenant. Vous pouvez aussi
   utiliser cet onglet pour visualiser les redirections, voir tous les
   liens (cassés ou non). Vous pouvez aussi définir de nouveaux filtres
   des liens en effectuant une recherche puis en cliquant sur le bouton «
   Créer un filtre personnalisé ». Par exemple, cela permet de créer un
   filtre qui ne montre que les liens dans les commentaires.

   Il y a plusieurs actions possibles pour chaque lien. Elles sont
   affichées lorsque vous survolez le lien avec la souris.
     * « Modifier l’URL » permet de mettre à jour le lien. Si le lien est
       présent dans plusieurs endroits (par exemple dans un article et
       dans la liste des liens), alors toutes les occurrences de cette URL
       seront mises à jour.
     * « Ne plus lier » supprime le lien mais laisse le texte du lien
       intact.
     * « Non casser » permet de changer l’état d’un lien cassé à
       opérationnel manuellement. Cette fonction vous permet de garder un
       lien opérationnel si vous savez que la détection est en erreur à
       cause d’un problème réseau ou d’un bug. Le lien ainsi marqué sera
       vérifié périodiquement mais l’extension ne le considéra pas casser
       tant qu’elle n’aura pas pu le vérifier au moins une fois.
     * « Oublier » cache le lien des vues « Liens cassés » et «
       Redirections ». Il sera toujours vérifié comme d’habitude et aura
       le style adapté à son état (par exemple un effet barré pour un lien
       cassé), mais il ne sera plus dans les notifications tant que que
       son état n’aura pas changé. Utile si vous souhaitez valider un lien
       comme étant cassé/redirigé et le laisser dans cet état.

   Vous pouvez aussi cliquer sur le contenu des colonnes « Etat » ou
   « Texte du lien » pour avoir plus d’informations sur l’état de chaque
   lien.

Avis

Did not detect all links, but highly useful!

   lynnmedia 19 septembre 2019
   Overall, a very helpful plugin. But it only reviewed about half of the
   links on my sizable blog. So, I might try the "nuclear option" or a
   different plugin. Extra stars for automatically suggesting the
   Webarchive -- a big time saver for me! Also, I am hear to read up more,
   it perhaps did not capture more links because I did not leave the dash
   open during the initial scan?

Link URLs are cut off. Must Hover each item in list 1 by 1 to see the url.

   SherylHohman 17 septembre 2019
   Not useful to me. It's too frustrating to see the urls of the broken
   images/links. Since every item must be hovered over, the "list" is
   effectively NOT a LIST at all! Also, there is no way to generate a text
   list. You can try the option which writes the debug info to a log file,
   but there is no reasonable way to filter out which lines to delete, or
   which lines to keep, even via regex, in order to wind up with a
   readable list of links that need tending to!! While it might be useful
   to many, I could garner no sense of the state of my website's image
   urls (I'm trying to clean out old generated thumbnails, and also update
   links to use newly generated thumbnail sizes) from the info this plugin
   returned to me. I did NOT TEST actions, such as updating links, or the
   like so I cannot attest whether the reported functionality WORKS. Hence
   3***. I ASSUME it essentially works. But the UI, and info returned did
   work for my particular needs. Your mileage may vary 🙂

Don’t work

   aksoysanat 10 septembre 2019
   Plugin don't working for Youtube videos.

Excellent, very accurate detection

   dmac 6 septembre 2019
   Excellent, very accurate detection, great for editing bulk links after
   a server migration. Highly recommended utility for devs.

Not working!

   niklasjm 27 août 2019
   I have used this plugin for a long time and thought it worked as it
   should. Now I found over 100 links that were not working from old post
   (different plugin). No wonder I don't get the traffic i should. If you
   want to use this double check with other websites to be sure...

Amazon links don’t work

   nicoweio 22 août 2019
   One thing that annoys me about this plugin is that it recognizes all
   Amazon links as broken. Amazon returns HTTP 503 for every request,
   probably because the Checker does not send a typical User-Agent Header
   etc. It would be nice if you could add such options or change the
   current configuration.

       starts with https instead of http.
     * Enabled the YouTube video checker by default on new installations.
     * Made the « dismiss link » option more permanent. Instead of
       restoring a dismissed link if the redirect URL changes even a
       little bit, the plugin will now ignore query string changes. This
       should fix many of the reports about dismissed links reappearing
       for no apparent reason.

     * Autres correctifs mineurs.

       where available.
     * Fixed plaintext URLs not being detected if they’re the very first
       thing in a post.
     * Fixed a bug that caused quotes and other special characters in the
       broken link CSS and removed link CSS fields to be auto-escaped with
       a slash, potentially breaking the CSS.
     * Fixed a bug that caused the « check custom fields » feature work
       inconsistently or not at all on custom post types.
     * Fixed duplicate custom field links showing up when the user creates
       a revision with different field values.
     * Fixed a specific type of false positive where some links would get
       flagged as « Unknown Error » and the log message would be « Empty
       reply from server ».
     * Fixed a bug where only the first enabled post type would be
       resynchronized during plugin activation.
     * Added more logging.
     * Removed Megavideo and MegaUpload modules. These sites no longer
       exist.

1.9.3

     * Testé sur WP 3.8.1 et WP 3.9-beta2.
     * Added an option to sort links by link text. May produce unexpected
       results for links that have multiple copies with different anchor
       text.
     * Ajouté une traduction vietnamienne.
     * Added file-based logging for debugging purposes. Logging can be
       enabled in the « Advanced » section of the plugin settings page.
     * Added a « Auto-Submitted: auto-generated » header to notification
       emails sent by the plugin. This should prevent « out-of-office »
       auto-responders and similar software from responding to these
       emails.
     * Added domain-based rate limiting to the HTTP checker module.
     * Throttled background parsing by about 40% to reduce overall
       resource usage.
     * Fixed (probably) a long-standing bug related to encoding
       international characters in link URLs.
     * Fixed a typo in the Polish translation.
     * Made the error message that’s displayed when trying to
       network-activate the plugin more useful.

1.9.2

     * Fixed several UI/layout issues related to the new WP 3.8 admin
       style.
     * Fixed HTML entity codes showing up in confirmation messages in when
       running a localized version of WP (only affects some languages).
     * Fixed the « dismiss this notice » link URL not being HTML-escaped.
     * Fixed a couple of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities related to
       the sort direction query argument not being properly validated and
       the bulk action form not escaping the current URL.
     * Updated Hebrew translation.
     * Mis à jour la traduction française.
     * When you dismiss a link, the dismissed link counter is now updated
       right away instead of on page reload.

1.9.1

     * Updated Dutch, German, Chinese and Portuguese translations.
     * Fixed suggestions not working on sites that force HTTPS in the
       WordPress admin.
     * Testé sur WordPress 3.7.

1.9

     * Added the ability to edit link text from inside the plugin. This
       features is only available for certain types of links.
     * Added a « suggestions » feature. When you go to edit a broken link,
       the plugin will now suggest replacing it with an archived page from
       the Wayback Machine (if available). You can disable suggestions in
       Settings -> Link Checker -> General.
     * Added a Hebrew translation.
     * Added support for HTML code in custom fields. To make the plugin
       treat a field as HTML, prefix its name with « html: » in BLC
       settings. For example, if you have a custom field named « foo »
       that contains HTML, enter it as « html:foo ».
     * Fixed: The « Status » column is now properly updated when editing a
       link.
     * Fixed: Visual feedback when a link is successfully edited.
       Basically, it briefly changes the row background to green.
     * Fixed: Email notifications will only include the « see all broken
       links here » link if the recipient can actually access that link.
     * Fixed some UI labels not being localizable.
     * The « Undismiss » action is now displayed in all views instead of
       only the « Dismissed » view. This way you can tell if a broken link
       has been dismissed without having to search the « Dismissed » list.
     * Added information about the last email notification sent to debug
       info. It’s accessible by clicking « show debug info » on the plugin
       settings page.

1.8.3

     * Added a Hungarian translation.
     * Fixed a bunch of « deprecated function » notices that showed up due
       to wpdb::escape() becoming deprecated in WP 3.6.
     * Fixed a vulnerability that would allow users with the ability to
       bulk-edit links to execute arbitrary PHP code by using a specially
       crafted regex as the search string.
     * Mis à jour la traduction allemande.
     * Replaced the old Dutch translation with a new and more complete
       translation by Robin Roelofsen.

1.8.2

     * Removed one of the translator credits links because Google flagged
       it as « suspicious ».
     * Mis à jour la traduction française.
     * Updated Polish translation.
     * Fixed several field size and layout issues that made the search
       form display incorrectly in Firefox.

1.8.1

     * Updated the Polish and Simplified Chinese translations.
     * Updated the German translation.
     * Added translation strings for two modules that were missing them.
     * Replaced a number of icons with GPL-compatible alternatives from
       Font Awesome.
     * Removed some unused images.

1.8

     * Added an option to only show the dashboard widget for users with
       the Administrator role, or to disable it completely.
     * Added a way to change the notification email address.
     * Added support for Smart YouTube « httpv:// » links.
     * Added support for protocol-relative URLs (for example,
       « //example.com/ »).
     * Added support for checking YouTube playlists.
     * Added a Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation.
     * Updated Chinese (Traditional) translation.
     * Switched over to storing plugin settings as JSON instead of
       serialized PHP arrays.
     * Improved error reporting in situations where the plugin can not
       load settings from the database.
     * Fixed: Display a more specific error message than just « update
       failed » when the plugin fails to modify a post. This only applies
       to WP 3.5+.
     * Fixed: Display the right URL for embedded YouTube playlists.
       Previously the plugin would show the same (incorrect) URL for all
       playlists.

1.7.1

     * Added an Arabic translation.
     * Mis à jour la traduction portugaise.
     * Mis à jour la traduction française.
     * Fixed MySQL errors caused by the plugin converting table names to
       lowercase.
     * Fixed a bug where the plugin would sometimes report broken Twitter
       links as working.
     * Fixed the plugin author URL.

1.7

     * Added support for youtu.be shortlinks.
     * Added a Finnish translation.
     * Fixed a graphical bug where the currently selected settings tab
       would not be highlighted in WordPress 3.5.
     * Removed the « Blogroll items » module from the list of link
       containers enabled by default. The WordPress developer team is
       planning to remove Link Manager from core, and the « Links » menu
       will be hidden by default in new WP 3.5 installs.
     * Removed the Admin Menu Editor Pro ad from the « Settings -> Link
       Checker » and the « Tools -> Broken Links » pages.
     * Disabled the news link (if any) for users who have donated.
     * Removed support for pre-WP 2.9 post meta actions.
     * Minor styling changes of screen meta links.
     * Updated Danish, Germa, Italian, French and Simplified Chinese
       translations.
     * Tested on WordPress 3.5.

1.6.2

     * Another attempt to fix the « database not up to date » that some
       users are still experiencing even with 1.6.1.

1.6.1

     * Fixed the « database not up to date » bug. Now the plugin should
       properly upgrade the DB.

1.6

     * Added a way to dismiss links. Dismissed links don’t show up in the
       « Broken » and « Redirects » lists, but are still checked as normal
       and get the normal link styles (e.g. strike-through for broken
       links). Useful if you want to, for example, acknowledge that a link
       is broken and leave it be.
     * Added a « Redirect URL » column. For redirects this will display
       the URL that the link redirects to. For normal, non-redirected
       links, it will be empty. This column is hidden by default. You can
       enable it in the « Screen Options » panel.
     * Mis à jour la traduction française.
     * Tested on WP 3.4.1.

       differences are quite minor).
     * Split the settings page into several tabs.
     * Removed the « Details » links as redundant. To display link
       details, click the contents of the « Status » or « Link text »

       various link types, e.g. HTML links, images, etc.

     * Fixed « Edit URL » and « Unlink » not working on PHP4 servers.

0.9.4.3

       database defaults instead).
     * Automatically clean up and optimize the plugin’s tables twice per
       month.

       it shows how long the plugin waited before assuming that the link

       buggy servers that incorrectly respond with 404 to HEAD requests.
     * Increased the default server load limit to 4.0 to prevent the
       plugin from idling endlessly on weakling servers.

0.9

     * Masquerade as IE 7 when using the Snoopy library to check links.
       Should prevent some false positives.
     * Fixed relative URL handling (yet again). It’ll work this time,

     * Misc fixes/comments.

0.8

       once.
     * Added a « Delete sources » bulk action that lets you delete all

       Doing this in WP 2.9 and up this will instead move the posts to the
       trash, not delete them permanently.
     * New bulk action : Unlink. Removes all selected links from all
       posts.
     * New bulk action : Fix redirects. Analyzes the selected links and
       replaces any redirects with direct links.

     * The background worker thread that is started up via AJAX will now
       close the connection almost immediately after it starts running.

       and mysterious slowdown some users have experienced when activating
       the plugin.
     * Updated Italian translation
     * Fixed an unlocalized string on the « Broken Links » page

0.6.5

       « Cancel » (respectively) when editing a link.

0.5.17

       or open_basedir enabled.

0.5.16.1

     * Be more careful when parsing safe_mode and open_basedir settings.

0.5.16

     * Also try the upload directory when looking for places where to put
       the lockfile.

0.5.15

     * Editing links with relative URLs via the plugin’s interface should
       now work properly. Previously the plugin would just fail silently
       and behave as if the link was edited, even if it wasn’t.

0.5.14

     * Made the timeout value used when checking links user-configurable.
     * The plugin will now report an error instead of failing silently
       when it can’t create the necessary database tables.
     * Added a table listing assorted debug info to the settings page.
       Click the small « Show debug info » link to display it.
     * Cleaned up some redundant/useless code.

0.5.13

     * Fixed the bug where the plugin would ignore FORCE_ADMIN_SSL setting
       and always use plain HTTP for it’s forms and AJAX.

     * Let the user set a custom temporary directory, if the default one
       is not accessible for some reason.

0.5.10.1

     * Fix a stupid typo

0.5.10

     * Separated the user-side functions from the admin-side code so that
       the plugin only loads what’s required.
     * Changed some internal flags yet again.
     * Changed the algorithm for finding the server’s temp directory.
     * Fixed the URL extraction regexp again; turns out backreferences
       inside character classes don’t work.
     * Process shortcodes in URLs.
     * If the plugin can’t find a usable directory for temporary files,
       try wp-content.
     * Don’t remove

   <

   pre> tags before parsing the post. Turns out they can actually contain
   valid links (oops).

0.5.9

     * Added an autogenerated changelog.
     * Added a workaround to make this plugin compatible with the
       SimplePress forum.

   treated as equivalent.

       showing up in the « Broken links » table.

       request.

     * Improved relative URL parsing. The plugin now uses the permalink as
       the base URL when processing posts.

0.5.5

     * Minor bugfixes
     * URLs with spaces (and some other special characters) are now
       handled better and won’t get marked as « broken » all the time.
     * Links that contain quote characters are parsed properly.

0.5.4

     * Fixed the uninstaller not deleting DB tables.
     * Other uninstallation logic fixes.

0.5.3

     * Improved timeout detection/handling when using Snoopy.

       login screen when saving settings.
     * Removed some stale, unused code (some still remains).

0.5.2

     * Fixed a SQL query that had the table prefix hard-coded as « wp_ ».
       This would previously make the plugin detect zero links on sites
       that have a different table prefix.

0.5.1

     * Fix a bug when the plugin creates a DB table with the wrong prefix.

0.5

     * This is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features.
     * See �http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/05/22/broken-link-checker-05/
       for details.

0.4.14

       headers.

0.4.12

     * There are no release notes for this version

0.4.11

     * Set the Referer header to blog’s home address when checking a link.
       This should help deal with some bot traps.
     * I know, I know – there haven’t been any major updates for a while.
       But there will be eventually 🙂
     * Fix SQL error when a post is deleted.

0.4.10

     * Changed required access caps for « Manage -> Broken Links » from
       manage_options to edit_ohers_posts. This will allow editor users to
       access that page and it’s functions.

0.4.9

     * Link sorting, somewhat experimental.
     * JavaScript sorting feature for the broken link list.

0.4.8

     * CURL isn’t required anymore. Snoopy is used when CURL isn’t
       available.
     * Post title in broken link list is now a link to the post
       (permalink). Consequently, removed « View » button.
     * Added a « Details » link. Clicking it will show/hide more info
       about the reported link.
     * « Unlink » and « Edit » now work for images, too. « Unlink » simply
       removes the image.
     * Database modifications to enable the changes described above.
     * Moved the URL checking function from wsblc_ajax.php to
       broken-link-checker.php; made it more flexible.
     * New and improved (TM) regexps for finding links and images.
     * A « Settings » link added to plugin’s action links.
     * And probably other stuff I forgot!
     * Grr 😛

     * Minor enhancements :
     * Autoselect link URL after the user clicks « Edit ».
     * Make sure only HTTP and HTTPS links are checked.
     * More substantive improvements will hopefully follow next week.

       if it’s already loaded.

0.4.5

     * Bugfixes. Nothing more, nothing less.
     * Revisions don’t get added to the work queue anymore.

     * Improved WP 2.6 compatibility.
     * Correctly handle URLs containing a single quote ‘.

       broken anymore.

0.4.3

     * Fix : Don’t check links in revisions, only posts/pages.

0.4.2

Google Analytics Dashboard + Real Time Stats

   Our goal at MonsterInsights is to make analytics easy and accessible
   for everyone.

   We understand that Google Analytics has a steep learning curve which
   often prevents small business owners from making informed decisions to
   grow their business.

   That’s why MonsterInsights comes with a built-in Google Analytics
   Dashboard for your WordPress site, so you can see all the useful
   information about your visitors right inside your WordPress dashboard.

   We have created customized Google Analytics reports to help you filter
   through the noise and see the stats that really matter!
     * Audience Report helps you get to know your visitors in a whole new
       way. It shows you detailed insights like which country your
       visitors are coming from, what are they most interested in, which
       device are they using, their age, gender, and a whole lot more. You
       can use this demographics report and audience clues to tweak your
       website design and content accordingly.
     * Behavior Report shows you exactly how people find your website,
       which keywords did they search for, who referred them, what did
       they click on your site, and more. You can use these useful stats
       to identify low-hanging fruits, new partnership opportunities, and
       promotional areas to focus on.
     * Content Report shows you stats on exactly which content gets the
       most visits, so you can stop guessing and start creating content
       that gets more traffic and conversion.

       revenue, conversion rate, average order value, top referral
       sources, and more (all in one place).
     * Forms Report shows you conversion stats for various contact forms
       and lead forms on your website, so you can improve the conversions
       to grow your business.
     * Search Console Report shows you exactly how well your website is
       ranking in Google, so you can further optimize your SEO to grow
       your organic traffic.
     * Custom Dimensions Report helps you dig deeper by showing you useful
       stats like who are your most popular authors, what are the best
       publication times, which are your most popular categories or tags,
       how well are your Yoast focus keywords and SEO score performing,
       and more.

   years of online business experience. We built MonsterInsights to be the

   Thirsty Affiliates, and others.

FAQ

   For all frequently asked questions, and their answers, check the
   MonsterInsights Knowledge base.

   Why use Google Analytics vs WordPress stats?
          Native WordPress stats plugin will always slow down your website
          because they rely on your WordPress hosting server. Most of them
          do not provide accurate WordPress analytics either.

          Some WordPress stats plugin use third-party servers to mitigate
          this issue, but they all lack powerful features that Google
          Analytics can offer.

          Google Analytics is the #1 analytics solution in the world. It
          comes with all the powerful features that you can ever ask for.
          MonsterInsights makes it easy for you to use all advanced Google
          Analytics features in WordPress.

   Can I use MonsterInsights together with another Google Analytics
          plugin?
          No. You should only use one Google Analytics plugin on your
          WordPress site. If you use multiple Google Analytics plugins,
          then you will compromise your data integrity. It will skew your
          data and you might see inflated stats.

          We recommend uninstalling other Google Analytics plugins before
          you install MonsterInsights.

   Why does MonsterInsights load Google Analytics in WordPress header
          section?
          Some people believe that loading Google Analytics in WordPress
          header will slow down your website. That’s a myth. Google
          Analytics loads asynchronously which means that it does not
          impact your website speed at all.

          MonsterInsights load Google Analytics code in WordPress header
          because it makes sure that you have the most accurate tracking.

   How does MonsterInsights help with Google Analytics GDPR compliance?
          MonsterInsights helps make Google Analytics GDPR compliance
          easier for business owners.

          Our EU compliance addon allows you to:

          + Anonymyze IP in Google Analytics
          + Disable the Demographics and Interest Reports for Remarketing
            and Advertising
          + Disable UserID and author name tracking
          + Enable the ga() compatibility mode
          + Integrate with Cookie Notice and CookieBot plugins to collect
            user consent before tracking
          + Integrate with Google AMP Consent Box before enable tracking
          + Integrate with Google Analytic’s Chrome browser opt-out
            extension and built-in cookie opt-out system
          + Offer Easy Opt Out link for Google Analytics tracking

          While no single plugin can guarantee 100% GDPR compliance in
          WordPress, MonsterInsights goes to great length in helping
          business owners with Google Analytics GDPR compliance.

          Need to Know.

          Ecommerce Tracking feature?

7.8.1: September 17, 2019

     * Tweak: Admin bar reports were no longer in the frontend.
     * Fixed: One of our Site Health integrations was triggering an error
       on PHP versions lower than PHP 5.5.

7.8.0: September 10, 2019

     * New: Welcome to Project Delight Phase 1! Over this and the next
       several major releases, we’re going to be focusing on polishing
       MonsterInsights and it’s addons. You can learn more about our
       Project Delight initative on our blog at monsterinsights.com/blog/.
     * New: We’ve added a new welcome screen for first time
       MonsterInsights users that makes it easier than ever to get started
       with our plugin.
     * New: We’ve added a pair of health checks to the WordPress core site
       health area to help make it even easier than ever to know that your
       MonsterInsights install is working properly.
     * Tweak: We’ve added more GA error code detection to help our users
       when their access tokens expire due to Google’s token expiration
       guidelines.
     * Tweak: We’ve adjusted some of the wording of settings in the plugin
       to make them clearer.
     * Tweak: You can now toggle the dashboard widget on/off directly from
       the dashboard widget (can also still be done in the Screen
       Options).
     * Tweak: We’ve added a link on the dashboard widget to bring you
       directly to the full Overview report.
     * Tweak: We’ve spent some time adding more checks and more verbose
       error messages whenever we show a user an error message. It rarely
       happens, but if we can make them more helpful when they do,
       everyone wins.
     * Tweak: We’ve ensured the menu items look good regardless of the
       WordPress admin color scheme used.
     * Fixed: While MonsterInsights does not track site administrators by
       default in order to prevent unintended skewing of the Google
       Analytics data by site owners, we’ve fixed a bug that prevented
       users from being able to track them if they wanted to.
     * Fixed: While we strongly recommend connecting with MonsterInsights
       since that allows the Reports and some of the more powerful
       MonsterInsights features to work, we’ve fixed a bug where if a
       manual UA code was added it was not removable on the mulitisite
       network panel due to a bug in the validation of that field.
     * Fixed: We fixed an issue where on the network admin area of
       WordPress sites, if the plugin SG Optimizer plugin was installed,
       their plugin’s CSS would mess up our plugin’s menu item icon.
     * Fixed: With our plugin’s conversion to VueJS complete, we’ve
       removed some old stylesheet and javascript files from the admin
       that are no longer needed.
     * Fixed: Sometimes the current screen was not set in the onboarding
       wizard so we’ve added some logic to ensure it’s always set for
       consistency.
     * Fixed: Javascript translations for the admin bar widget were
       sometimes loaded even if the admin bar widget was not going to load
       itself due to settings.
     * Fixed: We’ve fixed a couple spelling errors in the plugin.

7.7.0: June 18, 2019

     * New: Admin bar insights now available in the WordPress admin.
     * New: We’ve added a custom integration with the WP Site Health
       Checks area so that you know your site is always properly
       configured for Google Analytics tracking.
     * Tweak: We’ve tweaked our settings panel a bit to accomodate our new
       eCommerce tracking for LifterLMS.
     * Fixed: We’ve fixed a bug that caused a compatibility issue with
       WP-CLI.

7.6.0: April 24, 2019

     * New: Frontend admin bar reports for your website in the last 30
       days.
     * New: Brand new About Us page which includes info on getting started
       and using MonsterInsights features.
     * Tweaked: Updated the link content priority and aria-label is now
       used if present.
     * Tweaked: Prevent adding another Google Analytics tracking script in
       the custom code box.
     * Tweaked: Added a check to prevent using the current domain in the
       cross-domain setting.
     * Tweaked: Improved overall VueJS compatibility with scripts loaded
       by other plugins.
     * Fixed: Link attribution option disable was no longer disabling
       frontend tracking.
     * Removed: No longer used php pages which were replaced with VueJS.

7.5.1: April 9, 2019

     * Tweaked: Fix for Javascript error thrown by vendor min file causing
       breaking JS error on some hosting providers which breaks our
       plugin’s VueJS app.
     * Tweaked: Fix a conflict with a date.js file loaded by another
       plugin.

7.5.0: April 2, 2019

     * New: Updated Reports area using VueJS for better loading times and
       more consistency.
     * New: Updated Dashboard widget which now shows overview reports and
       is powered by VueJS.
     * New: Updated Tools page, better integrated with the new, VueJS
       powered, settings panel.
     * New: Brand new Cross-Domain setting to make it easier to track
       across multiple domains without having to add any code.
     * New: Added an integration with the ThirstyAffiliates plugins for
       the affiliate links tracking.
     * Tweaked: Improved the frontend affiliate code to support frameworks
       which modify the JavaScript Array prototype ( for example MooTools
       )
     * Tweaked: Onboarding Wizard feedback if JavaScript needed to run
       does not load correctly
     * Tweaked: Improved airplane mode compatibility
     * Tweaked: Improved double UA code detection
     * Tweaked: The affiliate report will now show the url of the
       affiliate link being navigated to instead of the label.
     * Tweaked: The label for the file download setting has been adjusted
       to be more clear.
     * Fixed: Manual UA code insertion from the dashboard has been fixed
     * Fixed: Network installs reauthentication was not working properly
       in certain situations
     * Fixed: Conflict resolution for Video Mate Pro theme and the RedQ
       Reuse Form plugin

7.4.2: January 29, 2019

     * Tweak: Added a filter to set the default value of events_mode and
       tracking_mode for compatibility with other plugins since we no
       longer use these options.
     * Tweak: Improved the Manual UA field for better feedback and
       compatibility.
     * Fixed: Missing image file added.

7.4.1: January 16, 2019

     * Fixed: WordPress Core currently has a bug (18857) that affects a
       super small percentage of our userbase (under 3%) that we’ve
       patched our plugin for until WordPress can get a fix shipped in a
       release.

7.4.0: January 15, 2019

     * New: Brand new settings panel written in VueJS! The new panel has
       been designed to simplify the process of setting up MonsterInsights
       and make MonsterInsights’s powerful features more user friendly to
       use.
     * New: Brand new onboarding wizard that walks you through setting up
       MonsterInsights and automatically configures your MonsterInsights
       settings based on your website needs in just a few minutes.
     * New: Users using the affiliate link tracking feature will find they
       can now define a custom label for each link they want to track, and
       it’s all validated in a new custom repeater field.
     * New: Significant performance improvements on both the admin and
       frontend side of things. This is best exemplified by the new
       settings panel, which loads significantly faster than the previous
       one.
     * New: MonsterInsights’s support staff often sees users who have
       upgraded to using MonsterInsights from other Google Analytics
       plugins (or even worse hardcoded tracking code), and forget to turn
       off the old tracking code. MonsterInsights will now automatically
       detect most of those other tracking codes and let you know so you
       get the most accurate tracking numbers from the start.
     * Tweak: We’ve gone through the whole settings area and rewrote the
       labels for each setting to make them more clear as to what they do.
     * Tweak: Based on our opt-in usage tracking data (thank you by the
       way for those that opt into it), we’ve removed a couple of the
       settings that nearly all users had enabled/disabled to make the
       panel even more simple and useful.
     * Tweak: Javascript conflicts with other plugins aren’t fun, so we’ve
       spent a ton of time testing with hundreds of plugins for this
       release, and changing our internal code to make it harder for
       plugin authors not following WordPress best practices to conflict
       with our code. We’ve been putting the data from the opt-in usage
       tracking system to test all of the top plugins and themes that our
       users run (and we’ll continue to do this moving forward).
     * Tweak: As part of our ongoing mission to make MonsterInsights
       accessible for all, we’ve spent a large amount of this release
       building out significant tooling for accessibility issue detection,
       and fixing any issues we have found on the new settings panel.
       We’re going to continue to work on ensuring MonsterInsights is not
       just the best Google Analytics plugin for WordPress but also the
       most accessible, and in future releases you’ll see even more
       compatibility updates for this.
     * Tweak: For users who are using the « light » admin color scheme,
       you’ll notice our menu icon now adapts to it automatically.
     * Removed: MonsterInsights’s debug mode has been removed. Originally
       designed as a tool for our support staff to use when helping users
       we found that we internally were not using it once we started using
       more powerful browser extensions, so to reduce user confusion
       (since it is not designed for use by users), we’ve removed it.
     * Removed: We’ve removed a bunch of long deprecated PHP constants,
       filters, and functions, and streamlined the install routines to
       make MonsterInsights even faster.

7.3.3: December 31, 2018

     * Tweak: Adjusted authentication compatibility checks to allow for
       more accurate checking.
     * Fixed: Issue where the save button might not appear for the network
       settings panel.
     * Fixed: Added compatibility shims for a couple plugins.

7.3.2: November 27, 2018

     * Fixed: Issue on some Lite installs where timezone differences
       caused users to see an error related to custom date ranges.
     * Fixed: Issue where some users were unable to reauthenticate their
       site.

7.3.0: October 30, 2018

     * New: We’ve added new custom link attribution, so now you can easily
       set custom link categories, actions, and labels, which
       MonsterInsights will use with precedence over our comprehensive
       automatic link detection, and is compatible with our AMP addon. For
       usage instructions, see our documentation on custom link
       attribution.
     * Tweak: Better error handling for reports.
     * Fixed: Issue where on MonsterInsights pages, the dropdowns on the
       WP admin menu might not work.
     * Fixed: Compatibility for Writee theme, YouTube by EmbedPlus plugin,
       Blog Time plugin, MaterialWP plugin and Swifty Image Widget plugin.
     * Fixed: Issue where on a network install of multisite, all sites
       might not de-authenticate on removal.
     * Fixed: Compatibility issue with Microsoft Edge and IE browsers
       where the table on overview report might overflow.
     * Fixed: On certain browsers when the browser screen width is small
       the graph tooltips might have appeared off-center.

7.2.0: September 19, 2018

     * Tweak: Sites with large traffic will see numbers larger than 1
       million abbreviated so the numbers will no longer overflow out of
       the report container boxes.
     * Tweak: We’ve clarified the download tracking setting to point out
       that externally hosted downloads are now tracked as downloads, not
       external links.
     * Tweak: Compatibility for the Fix WP Tables and Magee Shortcodes
     * Fixed: We’ve fixed issues where sites that were recreated/migrated
       sometimes could not re-authenticate with MonsterInsights.

7.1.0: August 8, 2018

     * New: Comprehensive review of the plugin to ensure styles are
       correct when utilizing a right to left language.
     * Tweak: Compatibility for the WP Media Folder plugin, TagDiv
       Composer plugin, Ali Dropship plugin, Affiliate Boxes plugin,
       Impreza theme, GT3 Photo & Video Gallery plugin, WP Booklist
       plugin, Houzez theme, Prowess theme, and Add Social Share plugin.
     * Tweak: Standardized capitalization and spelling of various strings.
     * Tweak: External download links will not be marked as downloads.
     * Tweak: Updated SweetAlert2 to the latest version.
     * Tweak: Tweaked error messages returned on the reports page to
       include more details and be more specific whenever possible.
     * Tweak: Documentation links will always open in a new tab now to
       ensure you don’t lose your place.
     * Fixed: Condition which caused the network UA code to not properly
       fallback in some instances.
     * Fixed: Some plugin links to our documentation have been corrected
     * Fixed: Sometimes error strings might be over-escaped. We’ve
       corrected some cases of this.

7.0.9: June 26, 2018

     * Tweak: The link to support for Lite now goes directly to the Lite
       support form.
     * Tweak: Compatibility fixes for the Newspaper theme and the
       WordPress Book List plugin.
     * Tweak: Sweetalert2, used for notices in core, now uses the newer
       7.x release, which has a slightly better layout and fixes some
       bugs.

7.0.8: June 19, 2018

     * Tweak: Fixes some links to our documentation site.

7.0.7: June 7, 2018

     * Tweak: Compatibility with Selz plugin.
     * Tweak: Issue where some settings would remain hidden inadvertently.
     * Fixed: Issue where some lite users would see an error regarding a
       license key.

7.0.6: May 14, 2018

     * Tweak: Better handling of link tracking for links embedded as
       anchor tags inside of an SVG image.
     * Tweak: Link tracking has been updated to enforce more strict type
       checks on variables.
     * Tweak: Plugin conflict notice has been updated to use the actual
       name of the plugin.
     * Tweak: Compatibility fixes for users of the Ken, Vitrine, Artisian
       Nayma,Grand News, Tie and Church Suite Themes along with the
       WooCommerce bolder product alerts, Selz eCommerce and Artisian
       Pages plugin.
     * Tweak: Fixed « you you » typo on the Reports page notice.
     * Tweak: On the overview report the indicator icon colors for bounce
       rate have been flipped to more accurately describe the impact (ie
       green = bounce rate going down = good).
     * Fixed: Undefined $tracking variable error.
     * Fixed: Better type checking before converting number strings to
       human readable dates on reports.
     * Fixed: If GA didn’t load and link tracking was enabled, an
       undefined Javascript error could occur if the fallback object
       didn’t get set (edgecase).

7.0.5: April 9, 2018

     * New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) that automatically
       attempts to correct for improperly set timezones in the WordPress
       settings panel, server timezone settings and/or GA profile
       timezones. This should eliminate issues with timezones on Lite user
       accounts, as well as allow for more accurate date reporting.
     * New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) to allow for
       deauthentication of profiles set on websites whose profiles were
       migrated (for example from a staging site to a production site)
     * Tweak: Made clientID retrieval more efficient.
     * Fixed: Several translation/textdomain and typo fixes.
     * Fixed: Undefined $num in the overview report.

7.0.4: March 7, 2018

     * New: We’ve added links to the pages listed in the top pages part of
       the Overview report to make it easier to see which page each title
       belongs to.
     * New: We’ve added the UA code to the account selector to make it
       easier to determine which property to use.
     * New: Better compatibility with IE11.
     * New: The links to view more reporting data now default to the
       currently selected daterange when you go to analytics.google.com
     * Fixed: We’ve corrected some missing closing li tags on the overview
       report.
     * Fixed: We fixed an issue where get_current_screen might be
       undefined on some pages.
     * Fixed: We fixed an issue where some improperly configured servers
       might resolve symlinks that are not supposed to be resolved,
       leading to issues with loading asset files MonsterInsights uses.

7.0.3: February 28, 2018

     * New: We added support for tracking download files that have a cache
       busting variable on the URL.
     * New: We added support for the new UserID mode used in our AMP
       addon.
     * Tweak: We fixed a bug with the notices class, and drastically cut
       back on the number of them.
     * Fixed: We fixed a bug with our Facebook Instant Articles addon that
       prevented some users from being tracked for downloads.
     * Fixed: We fixed a bug in the usage tracking for some types of
       installs.
     * Fixed: We’ve allowed the disabling of tracking for admininistrator
       role users on single sites.

7.0.2: February 27, 2018

     * Fixed: Fixed a bug with the analytics.js output where a UA code
       wasn’t entered, the $reason variable could be undefined.
     * Fixed: Fixed an issue where a notice might not be dismissable and
       we’ve also removed several of them.

7.0.1: February 26, 2018

     * New: Support for the updated version of MonsterInsights AMP plugin
       which switches from using a custom REST endpoint to using the now
       built in Google AMP ClientID synching feature. If you’re using the
       AMP addon, you’ll want to also update that addon as well.
     * New: The __gaTracker and disable tracking functions will always be
       defined, even when we’re not tracking users (for example if viewing
       a preview, or if a logged-in administrator) to allow sites to not
       have to worry about breakage when variable exist checking isn’t
       done.
     * New: We now output a notice in the console and output the GA code
       (though do not run it) when we’re not tracking someone. This makes
       it easier to verify the Google code is indeed outputting, and also
       makes it more clear as to why a particular user isn’t being
       tracked. Note, when testing Google Analytics code, always do it
       logged out, ideally in the private browsing/incognito mode of your
       web browser. We’re going to keep working on improving the frontend
       system to simplify it and add new features for both Lite and Pro
       users now that we’ve jettisoned ga.js support in MonsterInsights
       7.0. You’ll see updates through the year that add new tracking
       features, particularly ones that we’re tweaking in order to expand
       and refine our built-in reporting.
     * New: We added a « have a MonsterInsights license » link on the
       settings panel, to make it clearer the procedure for the quick and
       easy upgrade from MonsterInsights Lite to MonsterInsights Pro.
     * Tweak: We removed the phrase referencing the dashboard (removed in
       MonsterInsights 7.0) from the permissions settings.
     * Fixed: Due to us forgetting to include our jQuery shim for
       disable() in the Lite, some users were unable to use the 10/25/50
       expand feature on the reports page.
     * Fixed: An accidental use of the PHP function date instead of the
       one called time meant that some users were unable to see updated
       reporting data each day in the Lite version.
     * Fixed: In sitei() in the api-auth class, we used mb_strimwidth to
       trim the final string to 30 characters. While this is a great PHP
       function, not all servers have the mbstring (Multibyte String) PHP
       extension installed, from which all mb_* functions are provided,
       despite it being a « required » PHP extension to use WordPress
       core. This caused some servers to be unable to authenticate and
       thus get our amazing new reports (sad face). This usage has been
       replaced with a standard substr use, thus allowing for
       compatibility with all servers.

7.0.0: February 20, 2018

     * New: Completely revamped reports with a new UI.
     * New: Ability to oAuth at the network level, and have that oAuth
       apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a
       subsite level).
     * New: Ability to enter a license key at the network level, and have
       that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override
       at a subsite level).
     * New: Completely new oAuth flow, that handles more errors and allows
       for future growth. Importantly, your existing sites will continue
       to track (the UA code is manually moved in the upgrade process),
       but you will need to re-authenticate (a quicker, and even easier
       process in 7.0) to enable our all new reporting area. New
       permissions requested to allow for significantly expanded reporting
       (and some upcoming reports).
     * New: Ability to see the site traffic graphs in both pageviews and
       sessions.
     * New: You can now choose between Last 30 days, Last 7 days, or any
       date range of your choosing if you’re a paid MonsterInsights user!
     * New: Compare site traffic to the previous period.
     * New: Completely revamped overview report. You’ll find lots of new
       data has been added. Also, all of that data changes as you use
       change the date ranges (a Pro exclusive feature).
     * New: A brand new eCommerce report for Pro users
     * New: A brand new Search Console/Queries report for paid
       MonsterInsights users. This allows you to see which terms you are
       ranking for on Google and how Google searches are driving your site
       traffic, along with clickthrough rates.
     * New: A brand new Publishers report for Plus level users allowing
       you to see breakdown of important site metrics.
     * New: A lot of behind the scenes work enabling more reports to be
       added in the future. Stay on the lookout as we start significantly
       expanding the breadth and depth of reporting this year.
     * New: A revised general settings panel which is significantly faster
       to load.
     * New: Significant performance improvements. We completely
       top-to-bottom audited MonsterInsights. It’s now 286% faster in the
       admin and 161% faster in the frontend.
     * New: Completely new internal notification handling has been
       implemented. This should make it clearer if you need to address
       anything, and if so make it less tedious to figure out exactly
       what.
     * Tweak: We’ve changed the verbage for what users see if they are
       logged in as a site administrator on the frontend to make it more
       clear MonsterInsights doesn’t track site administrators to prevent
       them from skewing their own Google Analytics data (particularly
       demographics data) and to encourage them to use the Incognito
       Mode/Private browsing mode of their web browser (or log out) if
       they want to view the Google Analytics code.
     * Tweak: The URL used for the measurement protocol calls has been
       updated per Google guidance.
     * Tweak: We’ve discovered some strings that weren’t translatable, and
       fixed that.
     * Tweak: Based on your feedback, we’ve clarified the titles and
       descriptions used in some of the settings to make it more clear as
       to what they do.
     * Tweak: When first adding a license key, in rare cases sometimes the
       addons permissions didn’t sync. While extremely rare, and while
       MonsterInsights would automatically fix itself within 6 hours,
       we’ve added a system that eliminates this from happening, and made
       sure that there’s also a way to fix this manually if this need
       arises.
     * Tweak: The countries map has been changed to a countries list
       (sorted). This means we can remove jVectorMap which had some issues
       in mapping, and also make it easier for you to see your top
       countries data.
     * Removed: Support for the long deprecated ga.js tracking has been
       removed. We’ve had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable)
       persistent admin notices for over a year now, and it’s time to
       remove support for these finally. Analytics.js tracking is far more
       accurate than ga.js tracking. Users of ga.js were not able to take
       advantage of new MonsterInsights features and Google Analytics
       features that relied on analytics.js, including our out-of-the-box
       Javascript based events tracking system, and many other features
       (like enhanced eCommerce tracking in our eCommerce addon). Google
       themselves deprecated ga.js over 5 years ago. On update, we’ll
       automatically move those using ga.js to analytics.js. This switch
       requires no changes on behalf of the site owner.
     * Removed: Support for the long deprecated PHP events tracking has
       been removed. We’ve had dismissable (and then later
       non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now
       offering a 1 click update. The PHP events tracking, a stayover from
       the Yoast years, caused a lot of issues and couldn’t track
       everything on a page. It could only track things in specific
       WordPress areas like the_content and widgets, but couldn’t track
       anything outside of that, or things that were added to the DOM
       after WordPress rendered the page. Our JS events tracking system
       can track all-the-things on all parts of a page, and is far more
       accurate and easier for us to maintain. Maintaining a gigantic PHP
       regex-based system took a lot of our development time up, and based
       on our opt-in tracking data, almost no one uses it anymore (which
       is good, because JS tracking is so much better). Users still using
       it will be automatically switched to JS events tracking on update
       (which requires no changes to switch to using it).
     * Removed: Many deprecated filters from the Yoast era have been
       removed. After maintaining backwards compatibility for over a year
       now, and also issuing a notice every time those deprecated filters
       were used, it’s time to pull the plug on these to allow our
       tracking system to be able to be simplified in the future. We have
       a complete document in our documentation for the 6.0 release that
       details exactly how to update for each of these filters.

       installed pro version.
     * Fixed: Import/export settings page has been fixed so that on sites

     * Fixed: (pro users) Issue with JS events throwing an error for array

6.1.0, March 22, 2017

     * New: Campaign URL building tool with shortlink capability.
     * New: Settings import/export tool.
     * New: Experimental (beta) hash tracking for single-page style
       themes. Note, as the description for the setting says, this feature
       is a beta feature, and can be tweaked or removed in upcoming
       versions.
     * New: Manual default subsite UA’s can now be set from the network
       settings panel for MonsterInsights.
     * New: Optout of GA tracking is now enabled per Google standard. See
       https://github.com/awesomemotive/google-analytics-for-wordpress/iss

       possible.

       standards.

     * Tweak: More countries now shown in the country map in the overview
       report.

       just some.
     * Fixed: A syntax error involving the manual UA code input has been
       resolved that could have affected some users under a rare
       circumstance.

6.0.16, March 7, 2017

     * Fixed: Issues related to link tracking.

6.0.15, March 7, 2017

     * Fixed: Issue with translation string numbering in the disabled user
       group frontend template.
     * Fixed: Resolved issue that caused issue with lightbox-style
       redirects.
     * Fixed: Issue where admin pages had JS issues from mis-ordered JS
       files.

6.0.14, March 1, 2017

     * Tweak: Allow for invalid license to be removed if debug turned on.
     * Fixed: Issues with internal links being tracked as
       internal-as-outbound
     * Fixed: Issues with tracking of downloads
     * Fixed: Issue where optin tracking would opt-out on settings panel
       save

6.0.13, February 28, 2017

     * Tweak: Better detection of issues with authentication due to an
       outdate WP version.
     * Fixed: Issue where JS tracking inadvertantly turned on debug mode
       due to a bad string to boolean conversion.

6.0.12, February 27, 2017

     * New: The JS events tracking has been moved to a new JS file instead
       of inline. This will offer the same performance as inlining under
       HTTP/2, but with the benefit of better cache bursting.
     * New: Expanded admin adblock detection.
     * Tweak: Select2 is now bundled as Select300 in MonsterInsights.
       We’re pulling down the latest copy of Selct2 and then on-the-fly
       renaming it. This should end any conflicts between our select2
       boxes and other plugins/themes.
     * Tweak: We’ve implemented better error detection on the
       authentication flow. Some users may have previously seen « No
       profile errors », due to issues with their server setup will now
       see more accurate errors.
     * Tweak: For servers that use PHP Object caching, the cache will now
       be flushed during the uninstall routines. This should solve a very
       rare uninstall error.
     * Fixed: A « Invalid UA code » error was displayed whenever someone
       used oAuth2 and then saved the settings panel, despite having a
       valid UA code.
     * Fixed: An issue with the lazyloading of the Google Client for
       frontend use has been fixed.

6.0.11, February 24, 2017

     * Notice: Version numbers 6.0.5 – 6.0.10 were not used, as we’re
       synching the version numbers of the Lite and Pro versions of our
       plugin. You didn’t miss any updates.
     * Notice: As of this release, we no longer backport changes to the
       old yst_ga option. If you need to access MonsterInsights’s settings
       programically, please use our helper functions. Do not directly
       access a option.
     * New: Redesigned authentication dropdown that shows the site urls to
       make it easier to find a profile when the users have many accounts.
     * New: Tracking is now enabled for the WordPress admin login page
       (wp-login.php).
     * Tweak: The Google class in the admin now only checks for blocking
       when the reauth is attempted. Expect to save a ton of external
       calls in the admin, and maybe a performance boost.
     * Tweak: The GA client object is now lazyloaded on the frontend, so
       it’s loaded only when something (like another plugin) attempts to
       use it. In plain English, this will make a alot of sites load times
       significantly improve.
     * Tweak: The analytics.js output has been tweaked to be slightly more
       aesthetically pleasing (its aligned correctly). We realize no one
       probably cares but we look at this code for every user we support,
       so it help us.
     * Tweak: The config expired notice has been updated to reflect that
       it can also be shown if the server is blocking MonsterInsights’s
       ability to connect to Google Analytics.
     * Tweak: The cron jobs for opt-in tracking and statistics have been
       combined into a single cron.
     * Tweak: Various performance improvements in the frontend output
       class.
     * Tweak: A notice is now shown when MonsterInsights rejects a manual
       UA code from being saved for being an invalid format.
     * Fixed: Issue where the plugin TweetShare would prevent users from
       being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
     * Fixed: Issue where the manual UA code might not be ported as we
       were backporting changes to the monsterinsights_settings option to
       the yst_ga option for backwards compatibility. This lead to a
       situation where the new settings would override the old ones before
       the routine to fix the manual UA code issue had run.
     * Fixed: Issue where a fatal error from a reference to a class called
       « Yoast_Frontend_GA » which our plugin doesn’t have or use, would
       be shown caused by the previous Yoast usage of object caching via
       an autoloader. This is solved by doing a 1 time object cache flush
       on upgrade.
     * Fixed: Issue where if you had more than 1000 profiles on your
       Google account, not all would be shown.
     * Fixed: App analytics properties are now excluded from the dropdown
       of properties you can authenticate to.
     * Fixed: The readme suggested a filter to use for filtering the UA to
       use, but the filter name was typo’d. This has been fixed.
     * Fixed: Issue where the tracking cron would add a new unique cron
       each day.
     * Fixed: We implemented a routine to cleanup those extra crons as
       well as the old yoast one we no longer use.
     * Fixed: Issue where the .org theme Schema would prevent users from
       being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
     * Fixed: Issue where JS based events tracking might not correctly
       track a mailto: link.

6.0.4, February 20, 2017

     * Tweak: monsterinsights_delete_options now checks to ensure an array
       is passed in
     * Tweak: The reporting class now has many more object property
       checks.
     * Fixed: In install if WP version not supported or if MI Pro was
       active, the plugin attempted to call a property of the plugin
       object which didn’t exist.
     * Fixed: In the deactivate/uninstall routines, MI attempted to use a
       method of a class object which might not exist, as it might not be
       the active instance. Better instance handling has been added as
       well as many more exists checks have been added througought the
       plugin.
     * Fixed: Conflicting loads when both MI Pro and Lite are installed.
       Note, you should only have Pro installed if you want to use it.
       That being said, we’ve done extensive testing to ensure we’ve
       handled all of the edge cases surrounding this. This could also
       lead to issues where it would be impossible to remove Lite and/or
       Pro from a site if both were installed.
     * Fixed: Conflicts with the Pinnacle theme, which loads it’s CSS file
       (with overrides to literally all select2 inputs not just the ones
       it adds) across the entire admin. This lead to an issue where in
       the Google Auth, a user might not have been able to see (or could
       appear with wacky styling) the dropdown of profiles to select. If
       you cannot see this dropdown after authenticating, let us know as
       its most likely a simple plugin or theme conflict on CSS styling.
     * Fixed: The notices to deactivate/uninstall MI Lite/Pro when the
       other one were installed had an errant extra quotation mark, and
       they’re now more specific about the action to take.
     * Fixed: For some users, the setting for user role exclusion was not
       working. This has been corrected.
     * Fixed: A redirect issue that was looping for some users. The code
       that does this, while working for most, doesn’t for some. We’ve
       removed it until a full investigation can be completed.

6.0.3, February 20, 2017

     * Fixed: Path for fontawesome font files was incorrect
     * Fixed: Notice in the install routine for the $version variable not
       being set.

6.0.2, February 19, 2017

     * Fixed: Upgrade routine could drop manual UA codes in certain cases.
       If you upgraded to 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 and it lost the manual UA code,
       installing this update will automatically restore the UA code
       entered as long as you haven’t used the oAuth or re-entered the
       manual UA code.

6.0.1, February 19, 2017

     * Fixed: Typo that caused an issue with PHP 7 installs.

6.0.0, February 18, 2017

     * New: Completely overhauled design, from top to bottom. The plugin
       has been completely rewritten.
     * New: no more advertisements in the settings pages. We hated them
       too.
     * New: Javascript based event tracking
     * New: ga.js is now officially deprecated. New users cannot use it
       anymore, and existing users can only switch to analytics.js (but
       not back). Please note, all new features will be developed
       exclusively for analytics.js. Google has deprecated it, and now
       we’re deprecating our support for it.
     * New: License key system now uses the MonsterInsights License
       management system
     * New: Ability to pick which roles can access the dashboard/reports &
       settings/addons/tools page using our UI. There’s also a new custom
       capability for this (a meta capability)
     * New: Support for Google Analytics Master accounts. When you oAuth
       into MonsterInsights now, the UA view is now locked to what you
       picked using the brand new oAuth procedure.
     * New: Revamped dashboard
     * New: Completely new settings system, with a completely new settings
       page, and a completely new settings API. Also some new hooks and
       tabs in preparation for the many addons we’ll be releasing over the
       next few months.
     * New: No more conflicts between the base plugins
     * New: Completely overhauled translation experience. The lite version
       translations are now fully managed through
       translations.wordpress.org.
     * New: Opt-in to anonymous data so we can better improve
       MonsterInsights
     * New: Significantly better addons page
     * New: Single license key to manage all MonsterInsights extensions.
     * New: Automatic detection of blocked asset files (from things like
       un-whitelisted uBlock Origin) with step by step directions on how
       to easily correct.
     * Tweak: Completely overhauled the ga.js and analytics.js outputs to
       fix outstanding bugs.
     * Tweak: Better debugging + disabled + preview tracking modes, that
       more clearly indicate what’s going on
     * Tweak: Completely overhauled PHP regex tracking to solve nearly a
       dozen outstanding bugs including issues where non-link elements
       starting with the letter « a » such as tags would get parsed as
       links causing issues. Also solves issues related to single versus
       double quote usage for existing onclick handles, non-semicolon
       terminating onclick handles and various other parsing issues.
     * Tweak: Many previously untranslatable strings are now translatable.
     * Tweak: Minified in-plugin images.
     * Tweak: Minified admin css and js
     * Tweak: Uses latest version of Google PHP API now.
     * Tweak: The system for creating reports and getting Google Analytics
       reports have changed. If you’ve hardcoded into Yoast functions
       previously not designed for frontend output this could cause
       problems. We’ll introduce an API intended for this type of use
       after we update to use the v4 reporting API.
     * Fixed: Fixed an issue with HostEurope and other hosts modifying the
       default PHP arg seperator.
     * Fixed: Prevents an issue where users with a plugin like Airplane
       Mode active will get a better error message than « code invalid »
       on the GA token auth screen (and also fixes how that detection is
       done in other parts of the plugin).
     * Removed: unused track_full_url setting

5.5.3, October 3rd, 2016

     * New: Announces MI 6.0 beta.

     * New: Font based dashboard icon
     * Tweak: The « MonsterInsights » menu item name has been renamed to
       just « Insights »
     * Fixed: Issue with eCommerce addon (also requires user to update
       eCommerce addon)
     * Fixed: Issue with 2 dashboard links
