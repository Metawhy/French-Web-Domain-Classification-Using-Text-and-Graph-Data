     * avocado toast with eggs, spinach, and tomatoes
     * roasted cauliflower and chickpea tacos
     * roasted chickpea taco salad
     * chickpea shawarma bowls

   Just to name a few:) Avocados and chickpeas for life!

   Well, the best of both worlds have combined to create the ultimate
   avocado toast, Roasted Chickpea Avocado Toast. You guys, get excited
   because this avocado toast is going to rock your world! It is crazy
   good, so good that you will want to eat it every day!

   Avocado Toast Recipe

   And the best part? This recipe is SO simple. I have been eating it
   nonstop for weeks and I love it every single time. It is great for
   breakfast, lunch, or a snack! And guess what? My boys, Josh included,
   like it too! SCORE!

   Easy Roasted Chickpea Avocado Toast

How to Make Roasted Chickpea Avocado Toast

     * First, roast the chickpeas with all of the yummy spices and a
       little olive oil so they get crispy. Yes, this will take a little
       oven time, but you can put them in the oven and forget them…just
       make sure you set a timer:) AND if you are making the avocado toast
       for just you, you will have leftovers. You can keep the chickpeas
       in a container in the fridge and reheat them in the microwave. This
       is a great meal prep recipe!
     * While the chickpeas are roasting, whisk together the SIMPLE lemon
       tahini dressing. This will take you 5 minutes tops to make! It’s so
       easy and SO good! And you can keep the leftover dressing in the
       fridge so you can make avocado toast all week OR you can use it on
       any salad or make this or this. Both are TASTY! This dressing is a
       staple in our house, we always have it on hand.
     * To assemble the toast, toast your bread, I use whole wheat bread
       but you can use gluten-free bread or your favorite bread. Smash the
       avocado with a fork, add a little lemon juice, spread it onto your
       toast. Top with the roasted chickpeas and a drizzle of lemon tahini
       dressing. Eat and enjoy every single bite!

   If you are looking for an easy, healthy recipe that you can eat anytime
   of the day, this is it! This Roasted Chickpea Avocado Toast is vegan,
   vegetarian, and gluten-free…if you use gluten-free bread:) I am
   obsessed with it and I think you will be too. Don’t worry, it is a good
   obsession to have:)

   Cook Time
          30 minutes

   Total Time
          40 minutes

Ingredients

FOR THE CHICKPEAS:

     * 1 15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
     * 1 tablespoon olive oil
     * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
     * 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
     * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
     * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
     * 1/4 teaspoon tumeric

FOR THE LEMON TAHINI DRESSING:

     * 1/3 cup tahini
     * 1 clove garlic minced
     * 1 1/2 lemons juiced (about 4 tablespoons)
     * 1/3 cup hot water
     * Kosher salt and black pepper to taste

FOR THE AVOCADO TOAST:

     * 4 slices bread I use whole wheat, you can use gluten-free bread
     * 2 large avocados
     * Juice of 1 lemon
     * Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions

    1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
    2. In a medium bowl, combine the chickpeas, olive oil, cumin, garlic
       powder, smoked paprika, salt, and tumeric. Stir until chickpeas are
       well coated. Place on a large baking sheet and roast the chickpeas
       for 25-30 minutes, or until chickpeas are crispy.
    3. While the chickpeas are roasting, make the lemon tahini dressing.
       In a small bowl or jar, whisk together the tahini, garlic, lemon
       juice, and, water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. If the
       dressing is too thick, add a little more water and whisk again.
    4. Remove the pits from the avocados and discard. Scoop out the
       avocado flesh with a spoon and place into a medium bowl. Add lemon
       juice and mash with a fork. Season with salt and pepper.
    5. Spread the mashed avocado onto the toast slices. Top with roasted
       chickpeas and a drizzle of lemon tahini dressing. Serve
       immediately.
    6. Note-you can make the roasted chickpeas and dressing in advance. I
       store them both in the refrigerator. To reheat the chickpeas, place
       them in a microwave safe bowl and reheat for about 20 seconds.

   Roasted Chickpea Avocado Toast with lemon tahini dressing is a great
   healthy breakfast, lunch, or snack! #vegan #glutenfree #vegetarian

       I just made this recipe and it’s amazing!!! The chickpeas by
       themselves were incredibly good. I had to stop myself from eating
       them right after they came out of the oven so there would be some
       left for the toast. The dressing, chickpeas and avocado together
       was just devine. The second best part is how easy everything was
       make.

       Hi, thanks for the great recipes. I don’t have a pressure cooker
       but really want to try the Honey Sesame Chicken. Can you tell me
       how long to cook on the stove?
       Thank you!

       I made just the chickpeas, and they were quite tasty! I did reduce
       the amount of smoked paprika by 1/2 so the flavor wasn’t too
       overwhelming. Will make again!

       Hi Maria, I went and tried the avocado and chickpeas toast this
       morning, just to give the combination of the eggs and avocado a
       break and although I haven’t tried the tahini lemon dressing which
       sounds heavenly and something I would like, I did try adding
       Mexican hot sauce (Valentina) and it was so good. I will get on it
       with your recipe with the tahini sauce but this new combination of
       avocado and chickpeas is Soooooooo good!!!!

            It is ground up sesame seeds. Most grocery stores carry it. It
            is creamy like a nut butter.
