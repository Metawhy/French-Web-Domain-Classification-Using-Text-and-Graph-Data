   Our Vision
   Millions of People Living and Working in Space

   Blue's vision is a future where millions of people are living and
   working in space. In order to preserve Earth, our home, for our
   grandchildren’s grandchildren, we must go to space to tap its unlimited
   resources and energy. If we can lower the cost of access to space with
   reusable launch vehicles, we can all enable this dynamic future for
   humanity.

   Our Mission
   Infrastructure For The Creation of Human Spaceflight Capabilities

   We are focused on developing infrastructure for the creation of human
   spaceflight capabilities. If we can build a road to space with our
   reusable launch vehicles and lower the cost of access, we can enable a
   future of growth. We are building a road so your children can build the
   future.

   Our Capabilities

Reusability is The Starting Point

   Our reusable launch vehicles and rocket engines have lowered the cost
   of access to space. New Shepard is currently taking payloads to space
   and will soon fly astronauts. New Glenn's heavy lift capabilities will
   bring people and payloads to orbit. These next-generation launch
   vehicles are powered by our family of high-performance, reusable rocket
   engines.
