   Wedding Bells: The Most Beautiful Bridal Hairstyles
   Posted by LaurenConrad.com July 7th, 2015

   Wedding Bells: The Most Beautiful Bridal Hairstyles

   There are countless details that go into planning the ideal wedding.
   Most of us have been there for a friend or family member during their
   time of marital bliss, but you never fully realize just how much
   decision making goes into a wedding until it’s your time to shine.
   Before you know it, you’re neck deep in gown fittings, venue shopping,
   and wedding cake tastings. Wedding planning shouldn’t be a daunting
   task, especially when it comes to the fun part: getting all dolled up.
   That said, today we’re going to be talking about wedding hairstyles.

   We’ve gathered up some of the most gorgeous bridal hairstyles to get
   you inspired for your big day. Keep scrolling to see some of our
   all-time favorite hairstyles of 2015 (a hint of sparkle, fresh flowers
   and braids included)…

   1. Sleek Chignons.
   There’s something elegant and timeless about a low chignon at the nape
   of your neck. This pretty hairstyle may be simple but it sure doesn’t
   lack in the elegance department.

   2. Bohemian Headpieces.
   We love all of the bohemian trends we’ve been seeing this summer: From
   breezy dresses to strappy sandals, we’re smitten. This bridal headpiece
   is perfect for the boho bride that still wants a touch of sparkle.

   3. Pretty Plaits.
   When it comes to formal and romantic hairstyles, braids are evergreen
   in our book. This braided topknot is windswept yet completely put
   together. We love how this hairstyle pulls the hair away from the face,
   making way for a sultry smoky eye.

   4. Baby Blooms.
   While flower crowns are certainly still in style, we love this fresh
   take on wearing flowers in your hair. These tiny sprigs of baby’s
   breath look so sweet tucked into soft waves.

   5. Dainty Headbands.
   Once upon a time we were all little princesses daydreaming about
   marrying our prince charmings. While some brides opt to wear tiaras on
   their big day, we think that delicate headbands are a gorgeous
   alternative.

   6. Twisted to Perfection.
   Calling all Breakfast At Tiffany’s fans: Your wedding day is the
   perfect time to channel your inner Audrey Hepburn. Tasteful and classic
   to boot, you can’t go wrong with a French twist like this one.

   Which hairstyle is your favorite?

   Let us know which one you love most in the comments below!
