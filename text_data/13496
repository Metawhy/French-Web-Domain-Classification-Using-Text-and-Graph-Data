   8 Wirecutter Staffers on the Online Coffee Subscriptions They Love

8 Wirecutter Staffers on the Online Coffee Subscriptions They Love

   Published September 24, 2019
     * Ben Keough
       Ben Keough

   If you’ve browsed any of our coffee coverage, you know that we take our
   brew pretty seriously. From pour-overs to espresso machines, and from
   bean roast to brew strength, we have strong opinions about it all. This
   week, it’s all things coffee at Wirecutter.

   My ideal workday morning: I sidle up to “my” table at the local artisan
   roastery, toss a nod to my pals behind the counter, sit back, check
   Slack, and wait for my perfectly made pour-over to arrive. But that’s
   not my everyday reality, and it’s probably not anything like yours,
   either. If you want exceptional coffee but can’t get it—or if you
   simply hate shopping IRL—online coffee subscriptions can scratch that
   particular itch. You can find a huge variety out there, with some
   offering beans from a specific roaster, others culling them from a
   variety of nationwide micro-roasters, and still others focusing on
   specific regions or coffee styles. Lots of us at Wirecutter use them.
   Here are a few of our favorites.

MistoBox

   A Mistobox coffee subscription box along side a coffee cup and bag of
   coffee beans. Photo: Mistobox

   Who: Melanie Pinola, staff writer
   How: Bonavita BV1900TS 8-Cup One-Touch Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker or
   Bonavita Wide Base Porcelain Immersion Dripper
   When: biweekly
   Why: “I've been using MistoBox for about three years, and I’m happy
   with the variety they send. The tasting notes and descriptions are
   usually accurate, and I like that you can see what coffees are coming
   up, so you can update your queue (choosing from over 500 different
   coffees from small-batch roasters across the US). You can also
   reschedule shipment for any date.”

Craft Coffee

   Who: Nick Guy, senior staff writer
   How: OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker
   When: formerly biweekly, now more erratic
   Why: “My wife and I subscribe to Craft Coffee because, while I like
   good coffee, I’m also kind of cheap. Craft Coffee is perfectly
   serviceable. I’ve found it’s far better than grocery store beans,
   though it doesn’t have the ‘wow’ quality of some (more expensive)
   micro-roasters I like. It’s roasted fresh, although it seems they’ve
   moved their roasting operation in the past few months, and it takes a
   few more days for the beans to get to me than it used to. It’s the kind
   of coffee that I can enjoy in the morning without thinking about it,
   which is really all I need most mornings.”

Intelligentsia

   Who: Thorin Klosowski, editor
   How: Bonavita BV1901TS Connoisseur, AeroPress, or Clever Coffee Dripper
   When: biweekly
   Why: “I tried a variety of services, but Intelligentsia’s Web back end
   is just the best I’ve used. It’s super easy to modify the deliveries,
   skip deliveries, and do other weird things, like have two bags come
   every two weeks and one bag come once a month, on the same day as one
   of those other deliveries. Obviously you’re restricted to just
   Intelligentsia beans, which might be boring for some, but I find their
   coffee fine enough and especially tasty with the Bonavita. It’s also
   much better tasting when you don’t have to deal with the baristas at
   their storefronts.”

Tandem Coffee Roasters: The Good Thing

   Who: Alex Arpaia, staff writer
   How: OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker or Kalita Wave 185 Dripper
   When: monthly
   Why: “This coffee sub isn’t for everyone, but you get a lot of bang for
   your buck. It’s $35 (including shipping) for a monthly delivery of a
   pound of beans and a vinyl record of Tandem’s choosing. It might seem
   stressful to let someone else send you records, but their selections
   are often classics like Coltrane, Nina Simone, or Stephen Malkmus—stuff
   most people can probably get along with. The beans Tandem ships are
   usually from a rotating cast of their single-origin options. It’s a
   treat to wake up on Saturday mornings, put on the latest record, and
   brew a pour-over.”

Yes Plz

   coffee. Photo: Yes Plz

   Who: Daniela Gorny, associate managing editor
   How: Hario V60 Coffee Dripper, Chemex Six Cup Classic Series, or French
   press
   When: biweekly
   Why: “Even though I’m not subscribed to Yes Plz anymore (I’m trying to
   save money and cut down on my subscriptions in general), I totally
   would be if I had money to spare. I love that they send a little zine
   with your coffee, and that they’re based in Los Angeles, where I live.
   The zine is actually very good! Yes Plz coffee is available only
   online, and you don’t get a traditional 12-ounce bag—it’s a little
   smaller, 250 grams or around 8 ounces—so keep that in mind when you
   plan your shipments. A weekly shipment should be perfect for two
   people. And if you find you need to adjust or cancel (as I did), their
   website is a breeze to use.”

   (Staff writer Alex Arpaia also endorses Yes Plz, in addition to
   Tandem’s “The Good Thing.” She drinks way too much coffee.)

Blue Bottle: Origins

   Who: Justin Yost, lead software engineer
   How: French press
   When: weekly
   Why: “Blue Bottle’s coffee is always delivered on time (even around
   holidays), and the price is very reasonable compared to the prices of
   whole-bean coffee from local roasters here in Las Vegas. The quality is
   solidly in the pretty decent to excellent range, in my own amateur
   coffee snob opinion; I’d say it’s regularly at least a six on a
   10-point scale, and generally around an eight.”

Driftaway Coffee

   Who: Sam Morrison, program manager
   How: Hario V60 Coffee Dripper, AeroPress, Chemex Six Cup Classic Series
   When: biweekly
   Why: “Driftaway ships as soon after roasting as possible. Because I
   live in Canada and my beans need to cross an international border, this
   means I get my coffee at the ideal five days after roast for the
   freshest brew around. Driftaway has a flavor profile tool that I keep
   updated, so they’re sending the best beans and roast profile for me.”

Phil & Sebastian

   Who: Sam Morrison, program manager
   How: espresso
   When: weekly
   Why: “Phil & Sebastian is an Alberta-based roastery that ships to both
   Canada and the US. They offer three subscriptions: espresso, filter, or
   a bit of both. I use them for their espresso. They have a few different
   espresso beans that rotate through. I’m a heavy espresso drinker, so I
   have a pound delivered every week. This is some of the nicest espresso
   I’ve ever had. I’m not a barista, so I can’t always pull the perfect
   shot. That doesn’t really matter with the beans I get from Phil &
   Sebastian. At the same time, the variety of beans means I get to have
   fun tuning my machine from week to week. Great coffee from the caffeine
   fiends to the north.”

Verve

   Who: Erin Price, community lead
   How: Chemex Six Cup Classic Series, Hario V60 Coffee Dripper, or Kalita
   Wave 185 Dripper
   When: weekly
   Why: “I used to use (and love) the Verve roaster’s choice single-origin
   subscription, which sent me a different single-origin coffee every
   week. You can also focus your subscription on a specific region, only
   get espresso roasts, try a variety of blends, or just get bags of the
   same house blend every time. Managing the subscription is a breeze, and
   Verve sends a courtesy reminder before each shipment in case you need
   to make a change.”

What Does Death Wish Coffee Taste Like? (And Is It Safe?)

   Updated September 25, 2019
     * Rik Paul
       Rik Paul

   If you’ve browsed any of our coffee coverage, you know that we take our
   brew pretty seriously. From pour-overs to espresso machines, and from
   bean roast to brew strength, we have strong opinions about it all. This
   week, it’s all things coffee at Wirecutter.

   On some mornings, my mental gears turn extra slowly, as if their
   lubricating oil has congealed to tar. It’s those times when I’ve
   wondered whether the ultra-high-caffeine coffee Death Wish could give
   me a much-needed jump start.

   Death Wish is billed as the “world’s strongest coffee.” And although
   the company doesn’t release caffeine-content figures, we have seen
   third-party test results in an eye-opening range of 650 to 728
   milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce (Starbucks “tall”-size) cup. By
   contrast, Starbucks’s dark, medium, and blonde roasts have 193, 235,
   and 270 mg, respectively. (Darker beans generally have less caffeine
   than lighter ones.) So drinking a cup of Death Wish is like drinking 2½
   to 3 cups of Starbucks coffee.

   After brewing a 12-ounce cup of Death Wish (using the company’s
   recommended brewing ratio and grind size, and our top-pick pour-over
   dripper), I found the taste hearty and, yes, potently strong—all
   coffee, no subtlety. It was stronger than two Starbucks dark roasts I
   compared it with, but not bitter or unpleasant. It’s what I’d expect to
   find in the thermos of a lumberjack or a Bering Sea crab-boat skipper.

   Then again, I like dark-roast coffees. Most of the 16 other Wirecutter
   staffers who did a casual taste test gave it a vehement thumbs-down,
   calling it “bitter,” “overly roasted,” or “having a burnt flavor.”
   There were four enthusiastic supporters, but even two of them were
   hesitant about drinking it regularly.

   I found the taste hearty and, yes, potently strong—all coffee, no
   subtlety.

   Death Wish definitely delivers the buzz. Even from a 12-ounce cup, I
   felt a giddy surge of focus and alertness, a mental rocket launch into
   a personally productive stratosphere. But after a while, it left me
   feeling a bit edgy. Almost all of our testers felt more buzzed than
   normal, but less than half thought the extra caffeine helped them focus
   better. The few that found the experience uncomfortable complained of
   jitteriness, a headache, and acid reflux.

   So, the inevitable question: Is it safe? Most experts agree that
   healthy adults can safely consume about 400 mg of caffeine daily. But
   that varies a lot depending on the person’s weight, age, gender,
   metabolism, caffeine sensitivity, and built-up tolerance. According to
   Mary Margaret Sweeney, PhD, an instructor of psychiatry and behavioral
   sciences (and a recognized caffeine expert) at John Hopkins School of
   Medicine, drinking more than that could cause you to experience
   restlessness, nervousness, agitation, insomnia, and other effects.
   “Moderate doses of caffeine, usually up to 300 mg, tend to increase
   human performance on cognitive tasks,” she told me, but “higher doses
   may actually impair performance” in some people.

   Where does that leave Death Wish? According to Ted Kallmyer, a
   sports-nutrition coach and caffeine expert with Caffeine Informer,
   highly caffeinated coffees are intended for people who have built up a
   high tolerance to caffeine: “Their tolerance level is so high that only
   huge doses of caffeine produce a perceived effect beyond just feeling
   ‘normal.’” For anyone else, Kallmyer said, “steer clear.”

   6 Coffee Experts on the Gear They Use at Home Photo: Sarah Kobos

6 Coffee Experts on the Gear They Use at Home

   Published September 23, 2019
     * Anna Perling
       Anna Perling

   The specialty-coffee movement has brought us countless ways to brew
   beyond standard drip (although there’s a time and a place for that,
   too), from drippers to scales to temperature-precise kettles.
   Personally, I’m overwhelmed. To filter through the trends and gadgets,
   I wanted to ask the coffee pros what they use when they’re off the
   clock. Six baristas, roasters, bean buyers, and coffee educators from
   some of the best shops around the country weighed in on the gear they
   use every day.
   Bonavita BV1900TS One Touch Thermal Cafe Coffee Brewer
   Bonavita BV1900TS One Touch Thermal Cafe Coffee Brewer ($93 at time of
   publication)
   “As someone who makes and drinks (a lot) of coffee at work, I love the
   ease of my drip coffee maker, the Bonavita BV1900TS One Touch. I can
   brew a liter of coffee, share a mug with my fiancée over breakfast, and
   just pop the rest into an insulated travel mug for her to take to work
   (tragically, her office doesn’t have great coffee).”

   —Mike Balderrama, regional educator for Counter Culture Coffee,
   Washington, DC
   Le Creuset Petite French Press Coffee Maker (stoneware)
   Le Creuset Petite French Press Coffee Maker (stoneware) ($50 at time of
   publication)
   “I’m a tried-and-true lover of the French press. It’s simple and easy
   and foolproof. You can even take the whole press back to bed, my
   preferred morning routine. There’s always new coffee gear that comes
   and goes with the times, but I find myself using and loving simple,
   classic things. The Le Creuset stoneware Petite French Press is
   beautiful and retains heat well.”

   —Emma Chevalier, co-founder and coffee buyer at Revelator Coffee
   Company, Atlanta
   Breville Smart Grinder Pro
   Breville Smart Grinder Pro ($200 at time of publication) and Breville
   Precision Brewer ($200 at time of publication)
   “When it comes to coffee brewing, I am lazy. After brewing coffee
   professionally for over a decade, I don’t feel the need to tinker with
   manual brewing every morning. I want the easiest way to get the most
   delicious cup possible, and I just got a Breville Smart Grinder Pro and
   Breville Precision Brewer. The ability to effortlessly brew a large
   batch of really good coffee for me and my wife in the morning is a slam
   dunk. The Breville is consistent. I brew the same volume of coffee
   every morning, and the only thing that changes is the beans. For me,
   using an automatic brewer is a no-brainer—after all, it’s how many of
   my customers are experiencing their beans.”

   —Sumi Ali, roaster and co-founder at Yes Plz, Los Angeles
   Chemex 8-Cup Classic Series
   Chemex 8-Cup Classic Series ($44 at time of publication) or Hario V60
   Coffee Dripper ($22 at time of publication)
   “I prefer using the Chemex or Hario V60 ceramic dripper when I’m not at
   the shop. The Chemex allows me to make multiple cups at once, so it’s
   great to share with friends, and the Hario is better when I’m making
   one cup at a time. Both devices are forgiving and can produce
   consistently delicious coffee with good clarity. Since this method
   highlights the flavor notes in any coffee, you don’t have to be a pro
   to make it taste amazing.”

   —Adriana Uriostegui, barista at Coava, San Diego
   La Marzocco Linea Mini Espresso Machine
   La Marzocco Linea Mini Espresso Machine ($4,900 at time of publication)
   “Every morning, I drink Nguyen Coffee Supply’s Loyalty, a signature
   blend of 50/50 robusta and arabica. I pull an espresso shot with the La
   Marzocco Linea Mini Espresso Machine—20 grams in, 40 grams out. I add
   half an ounce of condensed milk, whole milk, and ice. If it’s cold
   outside, I’ll steam milk and make a latte. I prefer this method because
   the process of weighing everything out with a scale is pretty
   therapeutic—plus, it’s delicious. At least twice a week, and when I’m
   feeling nostalgic, I’ll use my Vietnamese phin filter to slow-drip some
   coffee, which will be stirred with condensed milk to make Vietnam’s ca
   phe sua. We just started producing our own custom branded phins, so
   it’s given me a reason to slow down and do things the old-school way.”

   —Sahra Nguyen, founder of Nguyen Coffee Supply, Brooklyn, New York
   Hario Wood Neck Drip Pot
   Hario Wood Neck Drip Pot ($37 at time of publication)
   “I won a Hario Wood Neck Drip Pot in a competition once, and to be
   honest, it’s my favorite brew method to play around with on my days off
   because it’s the black sheep of the pour-over family. The recipe and
   grind of the coffee is pretty similar to a V60, maybe a notch or two
   coarser. Aesthetically, I think the design of it is beautiful, like a
   Chemex with a cloth filter. The result is coffee that has similar
   characteristics to a French press, but without the sediment and a
   little more clarity of flavor.

   —Emily Orendorff, retail educator for Intelligentsia Coffee and 2019 US
   Barista Championship finalist, Austin, Texas

No, Coffee Doesn’t Stunt Kids’ Growth

   Published September 23, 2019
     * Courtney Schley
       Courtney Schley

   If you’ve browsed any of our coffee coverage, you know that we take our
   brew pretty seriously. From pour-overs to espresso machines, and from
   bean roast to brew strength, we have strong opinions about it all. This
   week, it’s all things coffee at Wirecutter.

   I don’t know exactly how old I was when I started drinking coffee, but
   I must have been in grade school because my earliest memories are of
   sipping a cup with lots of milk and no sugar while reading the comics
   before school.

   Coffee for kids wasn’t considered a big deal in my family when I was
   growing up in the 1990s. But I knew this was somewhat deviant: To most
   parents, coffee was an adult beverage, not appropriate for children.
   Kids shouldn’t even like the flavor. And everyone knows it’ll stunt
   your growth. Right?

   The idea that coffee stunts kids’ growth actually has no basis in
   science (as noted by The New York Times, which is now Wirecutter’s
   parent company). It likely dates back to the marketing efforts of
   Postum, a non-caffeinated, bran-based hot drink developed in 1895 by
   C.W. Post (inventor of Grape-Nuts). Through ads and articles, Postum
   tried to convince people that coffee was bad for everyone but
   especially for kids.

   height. Image: Postum ad, The Boston Daily Globe, 1925

   In what today we’d call an advertorial in the Boston Daily Globe in
   1901, Postum wrote that letting kids drink coffee was “a crime,” that
   it “prepares them for dyspepsia and nervous wrecks,” and, of course,
   that it “stunts their growth.” In a 1907 article in The New York Times,
   a mother reported that coffee caused her young son to “lie awake at
   night probably three or four hours, with his eyes wide open, talking to
   himself and grasping at imaginary objects in the air.” A switch to
   morning Postum cured the boy’s “coffee delirium.”

   I wasn’t too surprised when my second daughter developed a taste for
   coffee as a toddler, frequently asking for “coppy” in the mornings. I
   knew an occasional splash of homemade brew in her milk wouldn’t stunt
   her growth, or make her fall into a delirium. But was it okay for her
   to drink?

   The caffeine in coffee is still a problem for kids, said Dr. Marcie
   Schneider, a pediatrician and former member of the American Academy of
   Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Nutrition: “Coffee is an addictive
   substance. Caffeine is addictive.” Besides making you feel alert and
   awake, caffeine can cause a host of other changes in the body,
   including increasing your heart rate, blood pressure, and frequency of
   urination, and altering your digestion. It may make some people feel
   anxious, and it can interfere with sleep. “The smaller you are, the
   more susceptible you’re going to be” to caffeine’s effects, Schneider
   said. Moreover, “nobody knows what it does to a developing brain.”
   Although Postum’s most enduring claim—that coffee stunts kids’
   growth—proved false, the company was right in cautioning that frequent
   caffeine consumption isn’t good for children.

   So if you plan not to allow your child to taste coffee until they are
   older, you’re not wrong. The AAP says caffeine has no place in a
   child’s diet. But that means all types of caffeinated beverages;
   there’s nothing uniquely bad about coffee. According to a 2016 analysis
   of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, soda
   and tea are the most common sources of caffeine for children.

   Personally, when I let my daughter, now 4, have an occasional cup of
   super-milky coffee, I put it in the same category as her other favorite
   but less-than-nutritionally-ideal foods: vinegar-flavored chips,
   Entenmann’s doughnuts, and rainbow sprinkles on toast. All good things
   in moderation.
