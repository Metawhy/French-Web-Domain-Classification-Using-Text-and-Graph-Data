2 Tortured to Death in New Anti-Gay Purge in Chechnya, Activist Says

   Jan. 14, 2019
   [97ea9cd801fd4907be993ffd3bebc98a.jpg] Anton Podgaiko / TASS

   At least two members of the LGBT community have been killed as part of
   a new round of purges in Russia’s North Caucasus republic of Chechnya,
   an activist has told The Moscow Times.

   Reports surfaced last week that Chechnya has seen a spike since
   December in detentions of women and men suspected of being gay. A
   spokesman for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who had maintained that
   there are no gay people in his region, dismissed the claims as
   “disinformation.”

   “I can confirm that two gay men were killed while being tortured,” the
   head of the St. Petersburg-based LGBT Network, Igor Kochetkov, told The
   Moscow Times on Monday.

Don’t Tolerate the Intolerable from Chechnya’s Strongman Kadyrov (Op-ed)

   Read more

   He said around 40 people have been detained since the latest crackdown
   began on Dec. 29 and that Chechen police have confiscated the
   detainees’ travel documents.

   “This wasn’t happening in 2017,” he said, referring to Chechnya’s
   crackdown on LGBT people first reported on by the investigative outlet
   Novaya Gazeta. “Everything is being done so that they can’t flee the
   country.”

   “And this is very bad for us because it makes our work much more
   difficult in terms of evacuation,” Kochetkov told The Moscow Times.

   Meanwhile, the Meduza news website reported on Monday that between 10
   and 20 gay men and women had been killed in Chechnya in the past month.
   It cited an exiled member of the North Caucasus LGBT community who said
   he maintains contacts with witnesses of the latest alleged purge.

Russian ‘Whale Jail’ Company Slapped With $900K Fine Over Orca Captures

   June 14, 2019
   [TASS31750931-2.jpg] Yuri Smityuk / TASS

   A court in Russia’s Far East has fined a company nearly $900,000 for
   its role in the so-called “whale prison” that has garnered
   international outrage in recent months.

   Nearly 100 whales reportedly bound for export to China have been held
   for months in cramped pens near the Sea of Japan port of Nakhodka,
   triggering a wave of criticism. Russian officials in April signed an
   agreement with a group of international scientists to release the orcas
   and belugas.

Russia Decides to Free Captive Whales After Outcry – Governor

   Read more

   The Oceanarium DV company has been ordered to pay 56 million rubles
   ($869,000) for violating fishing laws in its capture of three orcas,
   Interfax reported Friday.

   The Frunzensky District Court in Vladivostok has also fined the “White
   Whale” company 30 million rubles ($466,000) for violating fishing laws
   during its capture of the orcas and beluga whales.

   The other two companies involved in the whales’ capture are set to be
   sentenced by the same court, Interfax reported.

   Oceanarium DV, which didn’t plead guilty during the court hearing, will
   be able to appeal the ruling.

   The Federal Security Service (FSB) has also brought charges against the
   companies for breaking fishing laws.

   While the companies have been ordered to release the whales, activists
   have said that the whales are not yet being rehabilitated for release
   into the wild and have spotted school excursions to the whales’
   enclosures.

2 Tortured to Death in New Anti-Gay Purge in Chechnya, Activist Says

   Jan. 14, 2019
   [97ea9cd801fd4907be993ffd3bebc98a.jpg] Anton Podgaiko / TASS

   At least two members of the LGBT community have been killed as part of
   a new round of purges in Russia’s North Caucasus republic of Chechnya,
   an activist has told The Moscow Times.

   Reports surfaced last week that Chechnya has seen a spike since
   December in detentions of women and men suspected of being gay. A
   spokesman for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who had maintained that
   there are no gay people in his region, dismissed the claims as
   “disinformation.”

   “I can confirm that two gay men were killed while being tortured,” the
   head of the St. Petersburg-based LGBT Network, Igor Kochetkov, told The
   Moscow Times on Monday.

Don’t Tolerate the Intolerable from Chechnya’s Strongman Kadyrov (Op-ed)

   Read more

   He said around 40 people have been detained since the latest crackdown
   began on Dec. 29 and that Chechen police have confiscated the
   detainees’ travel documents.

   “This wasn’t happening in 2017,” he said, referring to Chechnya’s
   crackdown on LGBT people first reported on by the investigative outlet
   Novaya Gazeta. “Everything is being done so that they can’t flee the
   country.”

   “And this is very bad for us because it makes our work much more
   difficult in terms of evacuation,” Kochetkov told The Moscow Times.

   Meanwhile, the Meduza news website reported on Monday that between 10
   and 20 gay men and women had been killed in Chechnya in the past month.
   It cited an exiled member of the North Caucasus LGBT community who said
   he maintains contacts with witnesses of the latest alleged purge.

Russian ‘Whale Jail’ Company Slapped With $900K Fine Over Orca Captures

   June 14, 2019
   [TASS31750931-2.jpg] Yuri Smityuk / TASS

   A court in Russia’s Far East has fined a company nearly $900,000 for
   its role in the so-called “whale prison” that has garnered
   international outrage in recent months.

   Nearly 100 whales reportedly bound for export to China have been held
   for months in cramped pens near the Sea of Japan port of Nakhodka,
   triggering a wave of criticism. Russian officials in April signed an
   agreement with a group of international scientists to release the orcas
   and belugas.

Russia Decides to Free Captive Whales After Outcry – Governor

   Read more

   The Oceanarium DV company has been ordered to pay 56 million rubles
   ($869,000) for violating fishing laws in its capture of three orcas,
   Interfax reported Friday.

   The Frunzensky District Court in Vladivostok has also fined the “White
   Whale” company 30 million rubles ($466,000) for violating fishing laws
   during its capture of the orcas and beluga whales.

   The other two companies involved in the whales’ capture are set to be
   sentenced by the same court, Interfax reported.

   Oceanarium DV, which didn’t plead guilty during the court hearing, will
   be able to appeal the ruling.

   The Federal Security Service (FSB) has also brought charges against the
   companies for breaking fishing laws.

   While the companies have been ordered to release the whales, activists
   have said that the whales are not yet being rehabilitated for release
   into the wild and have spotted school excursions to the whales’
   enclosures.
