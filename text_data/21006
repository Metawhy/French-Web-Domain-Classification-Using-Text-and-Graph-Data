   If you prefer to have immediate access to your patterns, we have a
   couple of different types of downloadable patterns available for

   If you're looking for vintage crochet and knitting patterns, as we
   reproduce vintage pattern leaflets, we publish the patterns on our Free
   Crochet Pattern and Free Knitting Pattern websites. You can print these
   patterns directly from the website for free.

   Additionally, we've been turning the entire leaflet into a a convenient
   eBook that is immediately available as a download as soon as payment is
   received. For only $1.49 each, you can save the entire eBook to your
   computer's harddrive for easy access anytime you want it.

   eBooks every time we reproduce a new vintage leaflet.
