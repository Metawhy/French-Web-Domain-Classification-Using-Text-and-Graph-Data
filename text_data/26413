About Us

Find out a little more about the development of Crocosaurus Cove

Crocosaurus Cove is a tourism venture which has operated on Mitchell St in
the heart of Darwin’s CBD since July 15th 2008.

   As a boldly conceived idea between 2 of Darwin’s most forward thinking
   businessmen – Doug Gamble & Mick Burns this $32 million venture
   (Crocosaurus Cove) has breathed new life into what was previously
   considered ‘vacant’ ‘unused’ land and converted it to what is now
   considered one of Darwin’s leading Tourist attractions.

   The 3 storey building set on 5,000 mts2 and occupying almost an entire
   city block has provided the City of Darwin with a unique inner city
   Wildlife based attraction that allows visitors to witness iconic Top
   End Crocodiles from 3 months to 80 years old in 8 purposely designed
   displays that can be viewed from all 3 levels

   Crocosaurus Cove is also home to the World’s largest display of
   Australian Reptiles and Australia’s first and only crocodile dive
   experience, the Cage of Death.
