   A healing virtual reality experience
   Why Wild Dolphin VR? Underwater VR Free 360°VR PREVIEW

   “

     An intense experience of the beauty, joy and intelligence of
     encountering dolphins can be a portal to bring people back.
     Back in touch with these elementals of life.
     With all sentient beings, including themselves.

   “

     The mission of the Dolphin Swim Club is to enable people to
     encounter one of the ocean's most enchanting creatures, the wild
     dolphin
     through virtual reality.

   “

   This footage will be accessible to anyone on the planet, whether it’s
   for fun,
   meditation or healthcare purposes such as reducing pain and anxiety.

   As well as getting the message out that it’s more fun to swim
   with wild dolphins this way, than to see them in captivity.

   You’re invited in their own home, the free oceans of the world!
