   This cookie policy (“cookie policy”) describes the cookies that Soho
   Works and its affiliated businesses (“we,” “us” and/or “our”) use on
   our respective websites (each a “Site”) and the choices that you have.
   This cookie policy forms part of the privacy policy of each of Soho
   Works and its affiliated businesses. Please refer to the privacy policy
   for the relevant business for information about (i) the purposes for
   which we use your personal data and our lawful basis for processing it,
   (ii) how we protect your data, and (iii) your rights and our
   obligations in relation to such use.

   If you are based in the European Economic Area, when you first visit
   the Site, you will be asked to consent to the use of cookies on the

Cookies and other technologies

   A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website
   and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can help a website
   like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage
   behavior. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no
   meaning outside of the assigning website. For more details on cookies
   and similar technologies please visit All About Cookies.

   Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time.
   “Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are
   deleted automatically once you close your browser. “Persistent cookies”
   cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration
   date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it),
   and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse
   the Internet again.

   The Site uses first party cookies (cookies set directly by us and are
   essential for using and navigating our services) as well as third-party
   cookies, as described below.

   We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the
   third parties described below, to get information about your usage of
