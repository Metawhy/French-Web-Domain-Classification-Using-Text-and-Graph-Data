Abstract

   We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current
   outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea
   is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonable
   bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,
   making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor
   issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The
   alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in
   the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas
   direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication
   attempts are commonâproviding an even better test of the validity of a
   phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct
   replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,
   opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of
   phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument
   that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the
   field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no
   plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is
   needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific
   practice.
   Keywords replication, publication bias

   Whenever people speak of a âcrisisâ in any enterprise that has been
   around for a very long timeâlike experimental psychology (or science in
   general)âa measure of skepticism is probably a very sensible reaction.
   Is the present flurry of concern about replicability and
   replicationâthe development that prompted the current special issue of
   Perspectives on Psychological Scienceâoverblown? In this article, we
   explore the three arguments that we have heard most often from
   scientists who see the current outpouring of concern over replicability
   as greatly overblown. These scientists, some of whom are prominent and
   accomplished researchers, view efforts to change scientific practices
   as unnecessary. We contend that these arguments are misguided in
   instructive ways. The first argument focuses on the rate of false
   positives (a topic aficionados of statistics and methodology are well
   familiar with).
     * Argument 1: It is a given that there will be some nonzero rate of
       false positives, but scientists keep this tolerably low by setting
       a relatively conservative alpha level (e.g., 5%).

   Thanks to the work of Ioannidis (2005b) and other statisticians, the
   essential problems with this view are already familiar to many.
   Nonetheless, it is our sense that a fairly large number of scientists
   in psychology and other fields are not familiar with this work and
   still tend (erroneously) to assume that alpha levels represent upper
   bounds on the rate at which errors can accumulate in a literature.

   So what is the truth of the matter? To put it simply, adopting an alpha
   level of, say, 5% means that about 5% of the time when researchers test
   a null hypothesis that is true (i.e., when they look for a difference
   that does not exist), they will end up with a statistically significant
   difference (a Type 1 error or false positive.)^1 Whereas some have
   argued that 5% would be too many mistakes to tolerate, it certainly
   would not constitute a flood of error. So what is the problem?

   Unfortunately, the problem is that the alpha level does not provide
   even a rough estimate, much less a true upper bound, on the likelihood
   that any given positive finding appearing in a scientific literature
   will be erroneous. To estimate what the literature-wide false positive
   likelihood is, several additional values, which can only be guessed at,
   need to be specified. We begin by considering some highly simplified
   scenarios. Although artificial, these have enough plausibility to
   provide some eye-opening conclusions.

   For the following example, let us suppose that 10% of the effects that
   researchers look for actually exist, which will be referred to here as
   the prior probability of an effect (i.e., the null hypothesis is true
   90% of the time). Given an alpha of 5%, Type 1 errors will occur in
   4.5% of the studies performed (90% Ã 5%). If one assumes that studies
   all have a power of, say, 80% to detect those effects that do exist,
   correct rejections of the null hypothesis will occur in 8% of the time
   (80% Ã 10%). If one further imagines that all positive results are
   published then this would mean that the probability any given published
   positive result is erroneous would be equal to the proportion of false
   positives divided by the sum of the proportion of false positives plus
   the proportion of correct rejections. Given the proportions specified
   above, then, we see that more than one third of published positive
   findings would be false positives [4.5% / (4.5% + 8%) = 36%]. In this
   example, the errors occur at a rate approximately seven times the
   nominal alpha level (row 1 of Table 1).

   Assumptions About Prior Probability of an Effect and Power.

   Table 1 shows a few more hypothetical examples of how the frequency of
   false positives in the literature would depend upon the assumed
   probability of null hypothesis being false and the statistical power.
   An 80% power likely exceeds any realistic assumptions about psychology
   studies in general. For example, Bakker, van Dijk, and Wikkerts, (2012,
   this issue) estimate .35 as a typical power level in the psychological
   literature. If one modifies the previous example to assume a more
   plausible power level of 35%, the likelihood of positive results being
   false rises to 56% (second row of the table). John Ioannidis (2005b)
   did pioneering work to analyze (much more carefully and realistically
   than we do here) the proportion of results that are likely to be false,
   and he concluded that it could very easily be a majority of all
   reported effects.

   For the probability that any given positive result in the published
   literature is wrong to occur as infrequently as the 5% alpha level,
   assuming 35% power, one would have to assume that the differences
   looked for exist about 75% of the time (fourth row in the table).

   So, what is a reasonable estimate for the prior probability of effects
   that are tested by psychologists? Ioannidis (2005b) considers many
   domains in which the probability seems quite certain to be extremely
   lowâfor example, epidemiological studies examining very long lists of
   dietary factors and relating them to cancer or genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) examining tens of thousands of genetic results.
   Experimental psychologists may think, âWell, that may be the case for
   massive exploratory studies in biomedicine, but I typically have some
   theoretically motivated predictions for which I have pretty high
   confidence.â Thus, the reader may want to argue that a prior
   probability of 75% is not necessarily too high. However, in considering
   the likely credibility of the psychological literature as a whole, the
   issue is not whether investigators sometimes test hypotheses that they
   view as having a reasonable likelihood of yielding a positive result.
   The issue, rather, is the number of effects that are tested and for
   which, given a positive result, investigators would proceed to publish
   the result and devise some theoretical interpretation. We suspect that
   if readers reflect on this question, they will conclude, as we have,
   that this number is often quite large even in research that is, in a
   broad sense, theoretically motivated. As Kerr (1998) and Wagenmakers,
   Wetzels, Borsboom, and van der Maas (2011) describe, experimental
   research is normally at least partly exploratory in nature even when it
   is presented in a confirmatory template. Thus, we would argue that the
   second row of the table probably comes closer to the situation in
   experimental psychology than we might like to imagineâimplying that
   Ioannidisâs devastating surmise (âMost published results are falseâ)
   could very easily be the case throughout our field. (Of course, this
   likelihood is amplified if journals are willing to publish surprising
   results based on a single positive finding, and we would argue that
   such a willingness is quite common, although certainly not universal.)

   Thus, the fact that psychology and similar fields usually insist upon a
   reassuringly low alpha level (typically 5%) does not by any means imply
   that no more than 5% of the positive findings in the published
   literature are likely to be errors. Moreover, the situation is surely
   much worse than what the discussion above would suggest because in
   addition to testing many hypotheses with a low likelihood of effects,
   investigators often exploit hidden flexibility in their data analysis
   strategies, allowing the true alpha level to rise well above the
   nominal alpha level (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011; see also
   discussion by Ioannidis, 2005b, of âbiasâ and Wagenmakers et al., 2012,
   this issue, on âfairy tale factorsâ). Moreover, the highest impact
   journals famously tend to favor highly surprising results; this makes
   it easy to see how the proportion of false positive findings could be
   even higher in such journals than it would be in less career-enhancing
   outlets (Ioannidis, 2005a; MunafÃ², Stothart, & Flint, 2009). Naturally,
   those areas within psychology that lend themselves to performing a
   great number of tests on a variety of variables in any given study, as
   well as areas in which underpowered studies are more common, are likely
   more prone to false findings than are other areas.

   In summary, our standard statistical practices provide no assurance
   that erroneous findings will occur in the literature at rates even
   close to the nominal alpha level (see Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom,
   van der Maas, and Kievit, 2012, this issue, on the remarkably low
   diagnosticity of results meeting the standard criteria for rejecting
   the null hypothesis). Given that errors are sure to be published in
   many cases, it seems to us that the most critical question is what
   happens to these errors after they are published. If they are often
   corrected, then the initial publication may not cause much harm.

   Unfortunately, as many of the articles in the current special issue
   document and discuss (e.g., Makel et al., 2012, this issue), the sort
   of direct replications needed for identifying erroneous findings are
   disturbingly rare. Moreover, even when such data are collected, the
   results are hard to publish, regardless of whether they confirm or
   disconfirm the finding. This brings us then to the second, and probably
   the most popular, response from defenders of the status quo.
     * Argument 2: It is true that researchers in many areas of psychology
       carry out direct replication attempts only rarely. However,
       researchers frequently attempt (and publish) conceptual
       replications, which are more effective than direct replications for
       assessing the reality and importance of findings because they test
       not only the validity but also the generality of the finding.

   This view was advocated, for example, by senior psychologists quoted by
   Carpenter (2012). In our opinion, this is a seductive but profoundly
   misleading argument. We contend that in any field where it is rare for
   people to conduct direct replications, and common to undertake
   conceptual replications, the field can be grossly misled about the
   reality of phenomena; and misled even more gravely than would happen
   based on the issues discussed above. The reason, it seems to us, is
   that conceptual replication attempts (especially when such studies are
   numerous and low in statistical power) interact in an insidious fashion
   with publication bias and also with the natural tendency for results
   perceived as âinterestingâ to circulate among scientists through
   informal channels.

   To shed light on this, consider the question: When investigators
   undertake direct replications and they fail to obtain an effect, what
   are they likely to do with their results? In the ideal world, of
   course, they would publish these outcomes in journals or make them
   public through other mechanisms such as websites or scholarly meetings.
   In fact, published nonreplications are rare (e.g., Makel et al., 2012;
   Sterling, Rosenbaum, & Weinkam, 1995). Nonetheless, we conjecture, when
   a respected investigator obtains but does not publish a negative
   result, the fact of the failure often achieves some limited degree of
   dissemination through informal channels. A failure to confirm a result
   based on a serious direct replication attempt is interesting gossip,
   and the fact is likely to circulate at least among a narrow group of
   interested parties. At a minimum, the investigator and his or her
   immediate colleagues will have reduced confidence in the effect.

   By contrast, consider what happens when a scientific community
   undertakes only conceptual replication attempts. If a conceptual
   replication attempt fails, what happens next? Rarely, it seems to us,
   would the investigators themselves believe they have learned much of
   anything. We conjecture that the typical response of an investigator in
   this (not uncommon) situation is to think something like âI should have
   tried an experiment closer to the original procedureâmy mistake.â
   Whereas the investigator may conclude that the underlying effect is not
   as robust or generalizable as had been hoped, he or she is not likely
   to question the veracity of the original report. As with direct
   replication failures, the likelihood of being able to publish a
   conceptual replication failure in a journal is very low. But here, the
   failure will likely generate no gossipâthere is nothing interesting
   enough to talk about here. The upshot, then, is that a great many
   failures of conceptual replication attempts can take place without
   triggering any general skepticism of the phenomenon at issue (see also
   Nosek, 2012, this issue, for a similar point).

   On the other hand, what happens when investigators undertake a
   conceptual replication and succeed? Without a doubt, such a success
   will be seen as interesting, and the researchers will seek to publish
   it, present it at meetings, and otherwise promote it. When they do so,
   they will likely receive encouragement from the original investigators
   (who are plausible reviewers for the work). Because the conceptual
   replication attempt differs from the original study in procedure it
   will often be seen as novel enough to warrant publication. In short, a
   conceptual replication success is much more publishable than would be a
   direct replication success, which is of course precisely why
   investigators are tempted to skip the direct replications and focus
   their efforts on conceptual replications.

   The inevitable conclusion, it seems to us, is that a scientific culture
   and an incentive scheme that promotes and rewards conceptual rather
   than direct replications amplifies the publication bias problem in a
   rather insidious fashion. Such a scheme currently exists in every area
   of research of which we are aware.

   We would go further and speculate that entire communities of
   researchers in any field where direct replication attempts are
   nonexistent and conceptual replication attempts are common can easily
   be led to believe beyond question in phenomena that simply do not
   exist. What conditions are needed to promote such pathological results?
   The key element would seem to be that a pseudoresult appears both
   exciting and easyâthe kind of result that would tempt hundreds of
   researchers to undertake small low-powered conceptual replication
   attempts (see Bakker et al., 2012; Ioannidis, 2005b). Enough of these
   will âworkâ just by chance to generate the strong impression in the
   community that successful confirmations are plentiful (and if
   investigators exploit the hidden degrees of freedom pointed out by
   Simmons et al., 2011, there will be more of these than one would expect
   from the nominal alpha level).

Pathological Science

   We speculate that the harmful interaction of publication bias and a
   focus on conceptual rather than direct replications may even shed light
   on some of the famous and puzzling âpathological scienceâ cases that
   embarrassed the natural sciences at several points in the 20th century
   (e.g., Polywater; Rousseau & Porto, 1970; and cold fusion; Taubes,
   1993). What many observers found peculiar in these cases was that it
   took many years for a complete consensus to emerge that the phenomena
   lacked any reality (and in the view of a few physicists, some degree of
   uncertainty may persist even to this day over cold fusion, although
   most physicists appear to regard the matter as having been settled
   decisively and negatively; Taubes, 1993). Indeed, it appears that many
   exact replication attempts of the initial studies of Pons and
   Fleischman (who first claimed to have observed cold fusion) were
   undertaken soon after the first dramatic reports of cold fusion. Such
   attempts produced generally negative results (Taubes, 1993). However,
   what kept faith in cold fusion alive for some time (at least in the
   eyes of some onlookers) was a trickle of positive results achieved
   using very different designs than the originals (i.e., what
   psychologists would call conceptual replications).

   This suggests that one important hint that a controversial finding is
   pathological may arise when defenders of a controversial effect disavow
   the initial methods used to obtain an effect and rest their case
   entirely upon later studies conducted using other methods. Of course,
   productive research into real phenomena often yields more refined and
   better ways of producing effects. But what should inspire doubt is any
   situation where defenders present a phenomenon as a âmoving targetâ in
   terms of where and how it is elicited (cf. Langmuir, 1953/1989). When
   this happens, it would seem sensible to ask, âIf the finding is real
   and yet the methods used by the original investigators are not
   reproducible, then how were these investigators able to uncover a valid
   phenomenon with methods that do not work?â Again, the unavoidable
   conclusion is that a sound assessment of a controversial phenomenon
   should focus first and foremost on direct replications of the original
   reports and not on novel variations, each of which may introduce
   independent ambiguities.

   This brings us to the third defense of the status quo to be discussed
   here: whether science is self-correcting in the long-term, even if it
   is error-prone in the short term.
     * Argument 3: Science is self-correcting but slowâalthough some
       erroneous results may get published, eventually these will be
       discarded. Current discussions of a replicability crisis reflect an
       unreasonable impatience.

   This long-term optimism, which we have heard expressed quite
   frequently, seems to boil down to two very distinct arguments. The
   first is that if one just waits long enough, erroneous findings will
   actually be debunked in an explicit fashion. Is there evidence that
   this sort of slow correction process is actually happening? Using
   Google Scholar we searched <âfailure to replicateâ, psychology> and
   checked the first 40 articles among the search returns that reported a
   nonreplication. The median time between the original target article and
   the replication attempt was 4 years, with only 10% of the replication
   attempts occurring at lags longer than 10 years (n = 4). This suggests
   that when replication efforts are made (which, as already discussed,
   happens infrequently), they generally target very recent research. We
   see no sign that long-lag corrections are taking place.

   A second version of this optimistic argument would contend that even if
   erroneous findings are rarely explicitly tested and refuted after
   substantial time delays, correction occurs in a different way. This
   view suggests that the long-term self-corrective process unfolds by
   field collectively âmoving onâ (in some nonrandom fashion) to focus on
   other (presumably more valid) phenomena. On this account, when the herd
   moves on, it is a sign that better grazing land has been identified
   elsewhere. This âsmart herdâ metaphor strikes us as appealing but
   generally misleading.

   Academic research is notoriously faddish, with nests of active
   researchers probing particular topics in one stretch of time and
   different topics a few years later. The notion that research findings
   within a topic that ceases to be an active focus of investigation can
   and should be regarded as suspect seems bizarre if one thinks through
   its implications. Although from time to time, individual investigators
   undoubtedly do give up on a topic when they find that results do not
   replicate, that is only one of many reasons why research interests
   changeâperhaps the questions have been satisfactorily answered, new
   techniques have made other topics more appetizing, or tastes have
   simply changed for other reasons. Merely noting that active research on
   a topic has diminished does not separate out any of these cases.

   To pick out just a few of a very large number of potential examples, in
   cognitive psychology there were waves of research at various times on
   such phenomena as selective attention to multichannel speech stimuli,
   effects of imagery on long-term memory, and articulatory working
   memory. In each of these areas, there was notable progress (including
   quite a bit of direct replication of prior results), and none of these
   areas were (as far as we know) seen by experts as especially subject to
   replicability problems. Yet relatively fewer behavioral investigations
   of these topics appear to have been published in recent years. The
   hiatuses, we think, are a joint sign of the success of the work itself
   and the fact that interests simply moved on. Other highly specific
   factors may play a role: in the case of attention research, for
   example, the dramatic shift toward using visual rather than auditory
   stimuli was probably due to perceived methodological advantages (i.e.,
   better temporal control). To assume that such shifts of research
   interest invalidate older bodies of empirical findings would, in our
   view, be ill-informed.

   The notion that declines in research activity on a given topic
   indicates that the empirical literature in that area is likely invalid
   flies in the face of the practices of those writing textbooks and
   review articles. For example, the bodies of research mentioned in the
   preceding paragraph continue to be discussed in leading textbooks
   (e.g., Reisberg, 2009), and we see no reason to think that they do not
   deserve such citation. Indeed, an assumption that older literatures are
   likely to be invalid would make a mockery of meta-analytic efforts,
   such as those seeking to uncover the causes of diseases by comparing
   effect sizes for predictor variables studied in widely scattered
   literatures over many decadesâefforts that have received highly
   positive reviews in the field (see, e.g., Heinrichs, 2001). Whereas
   both older and more recent bodies of work undoubtedly contain errors,
   there is no reason to believe that research fads provide a valid
   indicator of the solidity of different topics.

   The non-self-correcting nature of science has been highlighted lately
   in the pharmaceutical domain, illustrating the serious consequences of
   current practices. Recent reports emerging from the U.S. pharmaceutical
   industry reveal the extent to which an accumulation of errors in the
   basic research literature can obstruct translational progress. Writing
   in Nature, Begley and Ellis (2012) described the firsthand experience
   of the Amgen Corporation over a 10-year period in attempting to build
   drug development programs upon 53 âlandmarkâ published studies in
   preclinical (basic) cancer research. Despite systematic and strenuous
   efforts, they found that only six of the phenomena they examined (11%)
   could be replicated. They then noted that, âSome nonreproducible
   preclinical papers had spawned an entire field, with hundreds of
   secondary publications that expanded on elements of the original
   observation, but did not actually seek to confirm or falsify its
   fundamental basisâ (p. 532). A scientist from another major
   pharmaceutical company told a reporter âIt drives people in industry
   crazy. Why are we seeing a collapse of the pharma and biotech
   industries? One possibility is that academia is not providing accurate
   findingsâ (CNBC, 2012). These discussions show that invalid basic
   research findings frustrate the long-term translational process and
   that there is no reason to suppose that the frustration itself feeds
   back to correct errors in the basic science literature (for example, in
   the case described by Begley & Ellis, 2012, it does not appear that
   Amgenâs failures to replicate were ever published, so the erroneous
   results may continue to misdirect drug development efforts for years to
   come).

   In summary, we would argue that it appears almost certain that
   fallacious results are entering the literature at worrisome rates. More
   precise information about the rate at which this is happening in
   psychology should begin to emerge in due course from the Replicability
   Project described by Nosek (2012). Unfortunately, however, there is
   every reason to believe that the great majority of errors that do enter
   the literature will persist uncorrected indefinitely, given current
   practices. Errors will be propagated through textbooks and review
   articles, and people interested in a topic will be misinformed for
   generations. Finally, as the experiences of Begley and Ellis (2012)
   suggest, the long-term harm may not be limited to confusion; errors may
   also stymie the development of practical applications from basic
   research. At the very least, then, it seems to us that the onus is on
   anyone defending the status quo to articulate exactly how the delayed
   self-correction process they envision is supposed to operate and to
   show examples of where it is working effectively.

Concluding Remarks

   In closing, we have considered here three arguments offered by those
   who view current concerns about the rate of replicability problems in
   psychology to be overblown. We have contended that these arguments do
   not comport with the readily observable practices and habits of
   investigators in the behavioral sciences. In our view, there are likely
   to be serious replicability problems in our field, and correcting these
   errors will require many significant reforms in current practices and
   incentives. The possible directions for such reforms are discussed in
   many of the articles in the current issue.

Notes

   1.
   Here, we follow the standard approach of null hypothesis testing
   statistics and imagine that effects either exist or do not exist,
   ignoring the idea that differences of exactly zero may scarcely ever
   exist (see e.g., Nunnally, 1960). For those who find the arguments of
   Nunnally and others persuasive (as we do), it may be best to think of
   our discussions of âno effectâ as meaning âno effect big enough to have
   any scientific interest.â

Abstract

   We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current
   outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea
   is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonable
   bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,
   making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor
   issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The
   alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in
   the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas
   direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication
   attempts are commonâproviding an even better test of the validity of a
   phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct
   replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,
   opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of
   phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument
   that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the
   field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no
   plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is
   needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific
   practice.
   Keywords replication, publication bias

   Whenever people speak of a âcrisisâ in any enterprise that has been
   around for a very long timeâlike experimental psychology (or science in
   general)âa measure of skepticism is probably a very sensible reaction.
   Is the present flurry of concern about replicability and
   replicationâthe development that prompted the current special issue of
   Perspectives on Psychological Scienceâoverblown? In this article, we
   explore the three arguments that we have heard most often from
   scientists who see the current outpouring of concern over replicability
   as greatly overblown. These scientists, some of whom are prominent and
   accomplished researchers, view efforts to change scientific practices
   as unnecessary. We contend that these arguments are misguided in
   instructive ways. The first argument focuses on the rate of false
   positives (a topic aficionados of statistics and methodology are well
   familiar with).
     * Argument 1: It is a given that there will be some nonzero rate of
       false positives, but scientists keep this tolerably low by setting
       a relatively conservative alpha level (e.g., 5%).

   Thanks to the work of Ioannidis (2005b) and other statisticians, the
   essential problems with this view are already familiar to many.
   Nonetheless, it is our sense that a fairly large number of scientists
   in psychology and other fields are not familiar with this work and
   still tend (erroneously) to assume that alpha levels represent upper
   bounds on the rate at which errors can accumulate in a literature.

   So what is the truth of the matter? To put it simply, adopting an alpha
   level of, say, 5% means that about 5% of the time when researchers test
   a null hypothesis that is true (i.e., when they look for a difference
   that does not exist), they will end up with a statistically significant
   difference (a Type 1 error or false positive.)^1 Whereas some have
   argued that 5% would be too many mistakes to tolerate, it certainly
   would not constitute a flood of error. So what is the problem?

   Unfortunately, the problem is that the alpha level does not provide
   even a rough estimate, much less a true upper bound, on the likelihood
   that any given positive finding appearing in a scientific literature
   will be erroneous. To estimate what the literature-wide false positive
   likelihood is, several additional values, which can only be guessed at,
   need to be specified. We begin by considering some highly simplified
   scenarios. Although artificial, these have enough plausibility to
   provide some eye-opening conclusions.

   For the following example, let us suppose that 10% of the effects that
   researchers look for actually exist, which will be referred to here as
   the prior probability of an effect (i.e., the null hypothesis is true
   90% of the time). Given an alpha of 5%, Type 1 errors will occur in
   4.5% of the studies performed (90% Ã 5%). If one assumes that studies
   all have a power of, say, 80% to detect those effects that do exist,
   correct rejections of the null hypothesis will occur in 8% of the time
   (80% Ã 10%). If one further imagines that all positive results are
   published then this would mean that the probability any given published
   positive result is erroneous would be equal to the proportion of false
   positives divided by the sum of the proportion of false positives plus
   the proportion of correct rejections. Given the proportions specified
   above, then, we see that more than one third of published positive
   findings would be false positives [4.5% / (4.5% + 8%) = 36%]. In this
   example, the errors occur at a rate approximately seven times the
   nominal alpha level (row 1 of Table 1).

   Assumptions About Prior Probability of an Effect and Power.

   Assumptions About Prior Probability of an Effect and Power.

   Table 1 shows a few more hypothetical examples of how the frequency of
   false positives in the literature would depend upon the assumed
   probability of null hypothesis being false and the statistical power.
   An 80% power likely exceeds any realistic assumptions about psychology
   studies in general. For example, Bakker, van Dijk, and Wikkerts, (2012,
   this issue) estimate .35 as a typical power level in the psychological
   literature. If one modifies the previous example to assume a more
   plausible power level of 35%, the likelihood of positive results being
   false rises to 56% (second row of the table). John Ioannidis (2005b)
   did pioneering work to analyze (much more carefully and realistically
   than we do here) the proportion of results that are likely to be false,
   and he concluded that it could very easily be a majority of all
   reported effects.

   For the probability that any given positive result in the published
   literature is wrong to occur as infrequently as the 5% alpha level,
   assuming 35% power, one would have to assume that the differences
   looked for exist about 75% of the time (fourth row in the table).

   So, what is a reasonable estimate for the prior probability of effects
   that are tested by psychologists? Ioannidis (2005b) considers many
   domains in which the probability seems quite certain to be extremely
   lowâfor example, epidemiological studies examining very long lists of
   dietary factors and relating them to cancer or genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) examining tens of thousands of genetic results.
   Experimental psychologists may think, âWell, that may be the case for
   massive exploratory studies in biomedicine, but I typically have some
   theoretically motivated predictions for which I have pretty high
   confidence.â Thus, the reader may want to argue that a prior
   probability of 75% is not necessarily too high. However, in considering
   the likely credibility of the psychological literature as a whole, the
   issue is not whether investigators sometimes test hypotheses that they
   view as having a reasonable likelihood of yielding a positive result.
   The issue, rather, is the number of effects that are tested and for
   which, given a positive result, investigators would proceed to publish
   the result and devise some theoretical interpretation. We suspect that
   if readers reflect on this question, they will conclude, as we have,
   that this number is often quite large even in research that is, in a
   broad sense, theoretically motivated. As Kerr (1998) and Wagenmakers,
   Wetzels, Borsboom, and van der Maas (2011) describe, experimental
   research is normally at least partly exploratory in nature even when it
   is presented in a confirmatory template. Thus, we would argue that the
   second row of the table probably comes closer to the situation in
   experimental psychology than we might like to imagineâimplying that
   Ioannidisâs devastating surmise (âMost published results are falseâ)
   could very easily be the case throughout our field. (Of course, this
   likelihood is amplified if journals are willing to publish surprising
   results based on a single positive finding, and we would argue that
   such a willingness is quite common, although certainly not universal.)

   Thus, the fact that psychology and similar fields usually insist upon a
   reassuringly low alpha level (typically 5%) does not by any means imply
   that no more than 5% of the positive findings in the published
   literature are likely to be errors. Moreover, the situation is surely
   much worse than what the discussion above would suggest because in
   addition to testing many hypotheses with a low likelihood of effects,
   investigators often exploit hidden flexibility in their data analysis
   strategies, allowing the true alpha level to rise well above the
   nominal alpha level (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011; see also
   discussion by Ioannidis, 2005b, of âbiasâ and Wagenmakers et al., 2012,
   this issue, on âfairy tale factorsâ). Moreover, the highest impact
   journals famously tend to favor highly surprising results; this makes
   it easy to see how the proportion of false positive findings could be
   even higher in such journals than it would be in less career-enhancing
   outlets (Ioannidis, 2005a; MunafÃ², Stothart, & Flint, 2009). Naturally,
   those areas within psychology that lend themselves to performing a
   great number of tests on a variety of variables in any given study, as
   well as areas in which underpowered studies are more common, are likely
   more prone to false findings than are other areas.

   In summary, our standard statistical practices provide no assurance
   that erroneous findings will occur in the literature at rates even
   close to the nominal alpha level (see Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom,
   van der Maas, and Kievit, 2012, this issue, on the remarkably low
   diagnosticity of results meeting the standard criteria for rejecting
   the null hypothesis). Given that errors are sure to be published in
   many cases, it seems to us that the most critical question is what
   happens to these errors after they are published. If they are often
   corrected, then the initial publication may not cause much harm.

   Unfortunately, as many of the articles in the current special issue
   document and discuss (e.g., Makel et al., 2012, this issue), the sort
   of direct replications needed for identifying erroneous findings are
   disturbingly rare. Moreover, even when such data are collected, the
   results are hard to publish, regardless of whether they confirm or
   disconfirm the finding. This brings us then to the second, and probably
   the most popular, response from defenders of the status quo.
     * Argument 2: It is true that researchers in many areas of psychology
       carry out direct replication attempts only rarely. However,
       researchers frequently attempt (and publish) conceptual
       replications, which are more effective than direct replications for
       assessing the reality and importance of findings because they test
       not only the validity but also the generality of the finding.

   This view was advocated, for example, by senior psychologists quoted by
   Carpenter (2012). In our opinion, this is a seductive but profoundly
   misleading argument. We contend that in any field where it is rare for
   people to conduct direct replications, and common to undertake
   conceptual replications, the field can be grossly misled about the
   reality of phenomena; and misled even more gravely than would happen
   based on the issues discussed above. The reason, it seems to us, is
   that conceptual replication attempts (especially when such studies are
   numerous and low in statistical power) interact in an insidious fashion
   with publication bias and also with the natural tendency for results
   perceived as âinterestingâ to circulate among scientists through
   informal channels.

   To shed light on this, consider the question: When investigators
   undertake direct replications and they fail to obtain an effect, what
   are they likely to do with their results? In the ideal world, of
   course, they would publish these outcomes in journals or make them
   public through other mechanisms such as websites or scholarly meetings.
   In fact, published nonreplications are rare (e.g., Makel et al., 2012;
   Sterling, Rosenbaum, & Weinkam, 1995). Nonetheless, we conjecture, when
   a respected investigator obtains but does not publish a negative
   result, the fact of the failure often achieves some limited degree of
   dissemination through informal channels. A failure to confirm a result
   based on a serious direct replication attempt is interesting gossip,
   and the fact is likely to circulate at least among a narrow group of
   interested parties. At a minimum, the investigator and his or her
   immediate colleagues will have reduced confidence in the effect.

   By contrast, consider what happens when a scientific community
   undertakes only conceptual replication attempts. If a conceptual
   replication attempt fails, what happens next? Rarely, it seems to us,
   would the investigators themselves believe they have learned much of
   anything. We conjecture that the typical response of an investigator in
   this (not uncommon) situation is to think something like âI should have
   tried an experiment closer to the original procedureâmy mistake.â
   Whereas the investigator may conclude that the underlying effect is not
   as robust or generalizable as had been hoped, he or she is not likely
   to question the veracity of the original report. As with direct
   replication failures, the likelihood of being able to publish a
   conceptual replication failure in a journal is very low. But here, the
   failure will likely generate no gossipâthere is nothing interesting
   enough to talk about here. The upshot, then, is that a great many
   failures of conceptual replication attempts can take place without
   triggering any general skepticism of the phenomenon at issue (see also
   Nosek, 2012, this issue, for a similar point).

   On the other hand, what happens when investigators undertake a
   conceptual replication and succeed? Without a doubt, such a success
   will be seen as interesting, and the researchers will seek to publish
   it, present it at meetings, and otherwise promote it. When they do so,
   they will likely receive encouragement from the original investigators
   (who are plausible reviewers for the work). Because the conceptual
   replication attempt differs from the original study in procedure it
   will often be seen as novel enough to warrant publication. In short, a
   conceptual replication success is much more publishable than would be a
   direct replication success, which is of course precisely why
   investigators are tempted to skip the direct replications and focus
   their efforts on conceptual replications.

   The inevitable conclusion, it seems to us, is that a scientific culture
   and an incentive scheme that promotes and rewards conceptual rather
   than direct replications amplifies the publication bias problem in a
   rather insidious fashion. Such a scheme currently exists in every area
   of research of which we are aware.

   We would go further and speculate that entire communities of
   researchers in any field where direct replication attempts are
   nonexistent and conceptual replication attempts are common can easily
   be led to believe beyond question in phenomena that simply do not
   exist. What conditions are needed to promote such pathological results?
   The key element would seem to be that a pseudoresult appears both
   exciting and easyâthe kind of result that would tempt hundreds of
   researchers to undertake small low-powered conceptual replication
   attempts (see Bakker et al., 2012; Ioannidis, 2005b). Enough of these
   will âworkâ just by chance to generate the strong impression in the
   community that successful confirmations are plentiful (and if
   investigators exploit the hidden degrees of freedom pointed out by
   Simmons et al., 2011, there will be more of these than one would expect
   from the nominal alpha level).

Pathological Science

   We speculate that the harmful interaction of publication bias and a
   focus on conceptual rather than direct replications may even shed light
   on some of the famous and puzzling âpathological scienceâ cases that
   embarrassed the natural sciences at several points in the 20th century
   (e.g., Polywater; Rousseau & Porto, 1970; and cold fusion; Taubes,
   1993). What many observers found peculiar in these cases was that it
   took many years for a complete consensus to emerge that the phenomena
   lacked any reality (and in the view of a few physicists, some degree of
   uncertainty may persist even to this day over cold fusion, although
   most physicists appear to regard the matter as having been settled
   decisively and negatively; Taubes, 1993). Indeed, it appears that many
   exact replication attempts of the initial studies of Pons and
   Fleischman (who first claimed to have observed cold fusion) were
   undertaken soon after the first dramatic reports of cold fusion. Such
   attempts produced generally negative results (Taubes, 1993). However,
   what kept faith in cold fusion alive for some time (at least in the
   eyes of some onlookers) was a trickle of positive results achieved
   using very different designs than the originals (i.e., what
   psychologists would call conceptual replications).

   This suggests that one important hint that a controversial finding is
   pathological may arise when defenders of a controversial effect disavow
   the initial methods used to obtain an effect and rest their case
   entirely upon later studies conducted using other methods. Of course,
   productive research into real phenomena often yields more refined and
   better ways of producing effects. But what should inspire doubt is any
   situation where defenders present a phenomenon as a âmoving targetâ in
   terms of where and how it is elicited (cf. Langmuir, 1953/1989). When
   this happens, it would seem sensible to ask, âIf the finding is real
   and yet the methods used by the original investigators are not
   reproducible, then how were these investigators able to uncover a valid
   phenomenon with methods that do not work?â Again, the unavoidable
   conclusion is that a sound assessment of a controversial phenomenon
   should focus first and foremost on direct replications of the original
   reports and not on novel variations, each of which may introduce
   independent ambiguities.

   This brings us to the third defense of the status quo to be discussed
   here: whether science is self-correcting in the long-term, even if it
   is error-prone in the short term.
     * Argument 3: Science is self-correcting but slowâalthough some
       erroneous results may get published, eventually these will be
       discarded. Current discussions of a replicability crisis reflect an
       unreasonable impatience.

   This long-term optimism, which we have heard expressed quite
   frequently, seems to boil down to two very distinct arguments. The
   first is that if one just waits long enough, erroneous findings will
   actually be debunked in an explicit fashion. Is there evidence that
   this sort of slow correction process is actually happening? Using
   Google Scholar we searched <âfailure to replicateâ, psychology> and
   checked the first 40 articles among the search returns that reported a
   nonreplication. The median time between the original target article and
   the replication attempt was 4 years, with only 10% of the replication
   attempts occurring at lags longer than 10 years (n = 4). This suggests
   that when replication efforts are made (which, as already discussed,
   happens infrequently), they generally target very recent research. We
   see no sign that long-lag corrections are taking place.

   A second version of this optimistic argument would contend that even if
   erroneous findings are rarely explicitly tested and refuted after
   substantial time delays, correction occurs in a different way. This
   view suggests that the long-term self-corrective process unfolds by
   field collectively âmoving onâ (in some nonrandom fashion) to focus on
   other (presumably more valid) phenomena. On this account, when the herd
   moves on, it is a sign that better grazing land has been identified
   elsewhere. This âsmart herdâ metaphor strikes us as appealing but
   generally misleading.

   Academic research is notoriously faddish, with nests of active
   researchers probing particular topics in one stretch of time and
   different topics a few years later. The notion that research findings
   within a topic that ceases to be an active focus of investigation can
   and should be regarded as suspect seems bizarre if one thinks through
   its implications. Although from time to time, individual investigators
   undoubtedly do give up on a topic when they find that results do not
   replicate, that is only one of many reasons why research interests
   changeâperhaps the questions have been satisfactorily answered, new
   techniques have made other topics more appetizing, or tastes have
   simply changed for other reasons. Merely noting that active research on
   a topic has diminished does not separate out any of these cases.

   To pick out just a few of a very large number of potential examples, in
   cognitive psychology there were waves of research at various times on
   such phenomena as selective attention to multichannel speech stimuli,
   effects of imagery on long-term memory, and articulatory working
   memory. In each of these areas, there was notable progress (including
   quite a bit of direct replication of prior results), and none of these
   areas were (as far as we know) seen by experts as especially subject to
   replicability problems. Yet relatively fewer behavioral investigations
   of these topics appear to have been published in recent years. The
   hiatuses, we think, are a joint sign of the success of the work itself
   and the fact that interests simply moved on. Other highly specific
   factors may play a role: in the case of attention research, for
   example, the dramatic shift toward using visual rather than auditory
   stimuli was probably due to perceived methodological advantages (i.e.,
   better temporal control). To assume that such shifts of research
   interest invalidate older bodies of empirical findings would, in our
   view, be ill-informed.

   The notion that declines in research activity on a given topic
   indicates that the empirical literature in that area is likely invalid
   flies in the face of the practices of those writing textbooks and
   review articles. For example, the bodies of research mentioned in the
   preceding paragraph continue to be discussed in leading textbooks
   (e.g., Reisberg, 2009), and we see no reason to think that they do not
   deserve such citation. Indeed, an assumption that older literatures are
   likely to be invalid would make a mockery of meta-analytic efforts,
   such as those seeking to uncover the causes of diseases by comparing
   effect sizes for predictor variables studied in widely scattered
   literatures over many decadesâefforts that have received highly
   positive reviews in the field (see, e.g., Heinrichs, 2001). Whereas
   both older and more recent bodies of work undoubtedly contain errors,
   there is no reason to believe that research fads provide a valid
   indicator of the solidity of different topics.

   The non-self-correcting nature of science has been highlighted lately
   in the pharmaceutical domain, illustrating the serious consequences of
   current practices. Recent reports emerging from the U.S. pharmaceutical
   industry reveal the extent to which an accumulation of errors in the
   basic research literature can obstruct translational progress. Writing
   in Nature, Begley and Ellis (2012) described the firsthand experience
   of the Amgen Corporation over a 10-year period in attempting to build
   drug development programs upon 53 âlandmarkâ published studies in
   preclinical (basic) cancer research. Despite systematic and strenuous
   efforts, they found that only six of the phenomena they examined (11%)
   could be replicated. They then noted that, âSome nonreproducible
   preclinical papers had spawned an entire field, with hundreds of
   secondary publications that expanded on elements of the original
   observation, but did not actually seek to confirm or falsify its
   fundamental basisâ (p. 532). A scientist from another major
   pharmaceutical company told a reporter âIt drives people in industry
   crazy. Why are we seeing a collapse of the pharma and biotech
   industries? One possibility is that academia is not providing accurate
   findingsâ (CNBC, 2012). These discussions show that invalid basic
   research findings frustrate the long-term translational process and
   that there is no reason to suppose that the frustration itself feeds
   back to correct errors in the basic science literature (for example, in
   the case described by Begley & Ellis, 2012, it does not appear that
   Amgenâs failures to replicate were ever published, so the erroneous
   results may continue to misdirect drug development efforts for years to
   come).

   In summary, we would argue that it appears almost certain that
   fallacious results are entering the literature at worrisome rates. More
   precise information about the rate at which this is happening in
   psychology should begin to emerge in due course from the Replicability
   Project described by Nosek (2012). Unfortunately, however, there is
   every reason to believe that the great majority of errors that do enter
   the literature will persist uncorrected indefinitely, given current
   practices. Errors will be propagated through textbooks and review
   articles, and people interested in a topic will be misinformed for
   generations. Finally, as the experiences of Begley and Ellis (2012)
   suggest, the long-term harm may not be limited to confusion; errors may
   also stymie the development of practical applications from basic
   research. At the very least, then, it seems to us that the onus is on
   anyone defending the status quo to articulate exactly how the delayed
   self-correction process they envision is supposed to operate and to
   show examples of where it is working effectively.

Concluding Remarks

   In closing, we have considered here three arguments offered by those
   who view current concerns about the rate of replicability problems in
   psychology to be overblown. We have contended that these arguments do
   not comport with the readily observable practices and habits of
   investigators in the behavioral sciences. In our view, there are likely
   to be serious replicability problems in our field, and correcting these
   errors will require many significant reforms in current practices and
   incentives. The possible directions for such reforms are discussed in
   many of the articles in the current issue.

Notes

   1.
   Here, we follow the standard approach of null hypothesis testing
   statistics and imagine that effects either exist or do not exist,
   ignoring the idea that differences of exactly zero may scarcely ever
   exist (see e.g., Nunnally, 1960). For those who find the arguments of
   Nunnally and others persuasive (as we do), it may be best to think of
   our discussions of âno effectâ as meaning âno effect big enough to have
   any scientific interest.â
