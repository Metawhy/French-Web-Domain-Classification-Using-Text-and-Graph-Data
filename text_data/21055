It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   Almost four years of devastating conflict have plunged Yemen into one
   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   urgently need your help to do more.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Privacy Notice

   Oxfam International respects your privacy and is committed to
   protecting your personal data. This Notice explains when and how we
   collect your personal data when you use our website, and the rights you
   have over your own information.

   This Notice applies to the website of Stichting Oxfam International,
   however, when you use this site you may be directed to the website of
   other members of the Oxfam confederation or links to third party
   websites or applications. These websites will have their own Privacy
   Notices, which you should also look at.

   If you have any questions in relation to this Notice or would like to
   exercise your rights under it, please contact:

   FAO Data Protection Officer for Oxfam International
   Oxfam Ireland, 2nd Floor, Portview House, Thorncastle Street, Ringsend,
   Dublin 4.
   Email address for queries: info@oxfam.org

Information about who we are

   Stichting Oxfam International is a Dutch Foundation (registration no.
   41159611) with a registered Office at PO Box 30919, 2500 GX The Hague,
   The Netherlands. Further information, and details of our registration
   with data protection supervisory authorities are detailed below.

How our website works

   When you visit our website, we collect data on your location. This
   allows us to direct you to the website of the Oxfam Affiliate in your
   geographic region if this is necessary to perform any of your requested
   actions.

   We also use cookies on our website to collect standard internet log-on
   information and details of visitor behavior patterns (e.g. to find out
   the number of visitors to different parts of the site). This enables us
   to analyse and improve the content of our site and the navigation
   experience of users. We do not use this information to attempt to find
   out the identities of those visiting our website. Some cookies on our
   site also permit third parties to analyse visitor behavior to display
   advertising. These parties also do not use this information to attempt
   to find out the identities of individuals. For full details of the
   cookies used on our website, see our Cookies Notice. You can disable or
   delete some or all cookies in your browser setting, although this may
   affect some parts of the site’s functionality.

The data we collect about you

   There are a number of areas on our website where you may provide
   personal data to Oxfam International, including when you:
     * register for Oxfam email updates
     * sign an Oxfam petition
     * make a donation to Oxfam
     * register to be involved in our campaigns

   The information we collect will depend on the nature of your action but
   may include name, email address, telephone number, country and language
   preference. Where you make a donation through our website, we do not
   collect your financial information but direct you to a payment provider
   to process your donation and forward it on to Oxfam’s global fund. Our
   payment provider is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

   When you provide your information to us, we will only use the
   information for the purposes for which it is provided, for any
   compatible purposes and to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations
   unless you have agreed for your data to be used for other purposes.

When will we send you marketing communications?

   We will only contact you for marketing purposes (for example keep you
   up to date on our work based on your previous responses to our
   campaigns, or let you know of ways in which you can support that work)
   where we have your consent.

   At each place that you provide your personal data on our website, there
   is an opportunity for you to express your preferences in relation to
   marketing communications from us. Where you provide your consent to
   such communications, you can withdraw consent or change your
   preferences at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button on any
   marketing communication or by sending an email to info@oxfam.org
   expressing your preferences.

   We will generally treat any marketing consent you give us as lasting
   for 5 years, as we have found our supporters may get involved with
   different campaigns at different points over this period of time. We
   never sell or share your information with entities outside Oxfam for
   their marketing purposes.

Links to other Affiliate websites

   For some actions that you may like to take when visiting our website,
   you will be redirected to the website of an Oxfam affiliate in your
   geographic region. In these cases, that entity will collect your data
   rather than Oxfam International, and you should look at their Privacy
   Notice to understand how they will use your data, and your rights. This
   includes where:
     * you make a donation in a region where there is an Oxfam affiliate;
     * register to participate in Trailwalker;
     * apply for employment or to be a shop or festival volunteer; or
     * register to participate in a local campaign.

Who might we share your information with

   We may share your information with other members of the Oxfam
   confederation. We may also share your information with third parties
   who process data on our behalf, but only where we place obligations on
   them in relation to the security of the data and require them to use
   the data only as we instruct.

International transfers of data

   In some cases, we may transfer your personal data to members of the
   Oxfam confederation and third-party service providers who are located
   outside your jurisdiction.

   If you are in the European Union, and your personal data is transferred
   to an Oxfam Affiliate or third-party service provider outside the
   European Economic Area (EEA), this will occur under a safeguard
   mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate
   protection for your personal data.  Transfers to Oxfam Affiliates will
   occur under the EC’s model data protection clauses.  You may ask to see
   a copy of these clauses.

   Transfers of your data to other third parties outside the EEA, or to
   third parties outside any other jurisdiction in which you are located,
   will occur in accordance with local data protection laws.

Your data and social media

   This section refers to the ability for you to like, re-tweet, share,
   etc. Oxfam International content on social media platforms, such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Additionally, when using our
   website, you can link through to such social media sites. When you do
   this, depending on your privacy settings, these networks will adjust
   their marketing to show you more Oxfam and/or Oxfam-type content.  To
   change your settings on these services, please refer to their privacy
   notices, which will tell you how to do this.

Children’s data

   Our website is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly
   collect data on children.

Oxfam and social media

   Many social media sites provide, or permit, tools that aggregate and
   highlight content that appears on their site. Oxfam International uses
   such tools to analyse and assess the success of Oxfam campaigns and
   communications, the level of interest in issues Oxfam cares about, and
   the level of social media activity resulting from media stories about
   Oxfam or Oxfam/NGO activities. We use the native reporting tools of the
   social media networks, but may also use third-party tools.  Oxfam uses
   such tools to respond directly to other users’ queries and comments
   related to Oxfam.

How do we protect your data

   We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to
   protect your personal details. For example, our online forms are always
   encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored.

   We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we
   hold to ensure that your information is only accessible by
   appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.

   Where we use external companies to collect or process personal data on
   our behalf, we put a contract in place that sets out our expectations
   and requirements in relation to security of the data they access or
   process.  These organizations - referred to as "Data Processors" also
   have legal liability for the way in which your data is used, providing
   you with additional protection.

How long do we keep your data

   We will only retain the data you provide to us through our website for
   as long as required by applicable laws or as is necessary for the
   purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with any consents
   provided. We will delete personal data at the end of this period unless
   we wish to use it for statistical purposes, in which case we will
   anonymise it, such that you could never be re-identified with it.

Your rights

   You have the right to request details of the information we hold about
   you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal
   information, please make a request to our Data Protection officer at
   the details provided below. We will provide this information to you
   without charge, unless requests are manifestly unfounded, repetitive or
   excessive, in which case we are entitled to charge an administration
   fee.

   You also have a right to have inaccurate information we hold about you
   rectified or removed and a right, in some circumstances, to restrict or
   object to us processing your information, or to seek erasure of your
   data. If you believe we are not respecting your rights, you are
   entitled to make a complaint to a relevant supervisory authority.

   The legal basis on which we hold and use your data will vary depending
   on the activity involved. In some cases, we might hold the data because
   it is needed to fulfil a contract or meet our legal obligations (i.e. a
   donation), in others because it is in Oxfam’s legitimate interest to do
   so, and in others, because you have consented to this use. We note that
   the legal basis on which we process your data will influence your
   specific rights.

Changes to this notice

   We may make changes to this notice from time to time. We will always
   detail, at the end of this notice, the date it was last updated and you
   should check back from time to time.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   Almost four years of devastating conflict have plunged Yemen into one
   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Privacy Notice

   Oxfam International respects your privacy and is committed to
   protecting your personal data. This Notice explains when and how we
   collect your personal data when you use our website, and the rights you
   have over your own information.

   This Notice applies to the website of Stichting Oxfam International,
   however, when you use this site you may be directed to the website of
   other members of the Oxfam confederation or links to third party
   websites or applications. These websites will have their own Privacy
   Notices, which you should also look at.

   If you have any questions in relation to this Notice or would like to
   exercise your rights under it, please contact:

   FAO Data Protection Officer for Oxfam International
   Oxfam Ireland, 2nd Floor, Portview House, Thorncastle Street, Ringsend,
   Dublin 4.
   Email address for queries: info@oxfam.org

Information about who we are

   Stichting Oxfam International is a Dutch Foundation (registration no.
   41159611) with a registered Office at PO Box 30919, 2500 GX The Hague,
   The Netherlands. Further information, and details of our registration
   with data protection supervisory authorities are detailed below.

How our website works

   When you visit our website, we collect data on your location. This
   allows us to direct you to the website of the Oxfam Affiliate in your
   geographic region if this is necessary to perform any of your requested
   actions.

   We also use cookies on our website to collect standard internet log-on
   information and details of visitor behavior patterns (e.g. to find out
   the number of visitors to different parts of the site). This enables us
   to analyse and improve the content of our site and the navigation
   experience of users. We do not use this information to attempt to find
   out the identities of those visiting our website. Some cookies on our
   site also permit third parties to analyse visitor behavior to display
   advertising. These parties also do not use this information to attempt
   to find out the identities of individuals. For full details of the
   cookies used on our website, see our Cookies Notice. You can disable or
   delete some or all cookies in your browser setting, although this may
   affect some parts of the site’s functionality.

The data we collect about you

   There are a number of areas on our website where you may provide
   personal data to Oxfam International, including when you:
     * register for Oxfam email updates
     * sign an Oxfam petition
     * make a donation to Oxfam
     * register to be involved in our campaigns

   The information we collect will depend on the nature of your action but
   may include name, email address, telephone number, country and language
   preference. Where you make a donation through our website, we do not
   collect your financial information but direct you to a payment provider
   to process your donation and forward it on to Oxfam’s global fund. Our
   payment provider is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

   When you provide your information to us, we will only use the
   information for the purposes for which it is provided, for any
   compatible purposes and to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations
   unless you have agreed for your data to be used for other purposes.

When will we send you marketing communications?

   We will only contact you for marketing purposes (for example keep you
   up to date on our work based on your previous responses to our
   campaigns, or let you know of ways in which you can support that work)
   where we have your consent.

   At each place that you provide your personal data on our website, there
   is an opportunity for you to express your preferences in relation to
   marketing communications from us. Where you provide your consent to
   such communications, you can withdraw consent or change your
   preferences at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button on any
   marketing communication or by sending an email to info@oxfam.org
   expressing your preferences.

   We will generally treat any marketing consent you give us as lasting
   for 5 years, as we have found our supporters may get involved with
   different campaigns at different points over this period of time. We
   never sell or share your information with entities outside Oxfam for
   their marketing purposes.

Links to other Affiliate websites

   For some actions that you may like to take when visiting our website,
   you will be redirected to the website of an Oxfam affiliate in your
   geographic region. In these cases, that entity will collect your data
   rather than Oxfam International, and you should look at their Privacy
   Notice to understand how they will use your data, and your rights. This
   includes where:
     * you make a donation in a region where there is an Oxfam affiliate;
     * register to participate in Trailwalker;
     * apply for employment or to be a shop or festival volunteer; or
     * register to participate in a local campaign.

Who might we share your information with

   We may share your information with other members of the Oxfam
   confederation. We may also share your information with third parties
   who process data on our behalf, but only where we place obligations on
   them in relation to the security of the data and require them to use
   the data only as we instruct.

International transfers of data

   In some cases, we may transfer your personal data to members of the
   Oxfam confederation and third-party service providers who are located
   outside your jurisdiction.

   If you are in the European Union, and your personal data is transferred
   to an Oxfam Affiliate or third-party service provider outside the
   European Economic Area (EEA), this will occur under a safeguard
   mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate
   protection for your personal data.  Transfers to Oxfam Affiliates will
   occur under the EC’s model data protection clauses.  You may ask to see
   a copy of these clauses.

   Transfers of your data to other third parties outside the EEA, or to
   third parties outside any other jurisdiction in which you are located,
   will occur in accordance with local data protection laws.

Your data and social media

   This section refers to the ability for you to like, re-tweet, share,
   etc. Oxfam International content on social media platforms, such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Additionally, when using our
   website, you can link through to such social media sites. When you do
   this, depending on your privacy settings, these networks will adjust
   their marketing to show you more Oxfam and/or Oxfam-type content.  To
   change your settings on these services, please refer to their privacy
   notices, which will tell you how to do this.

Children’s data

   Our website is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly
   collect data on children.

Oxfam and social media

   Many social media sites provide, or permit, tools that aggregate and
   highlight content that appears on their site. Oxfam International uses
   such tools to analyse and assess the success of Oxfam campaigns and
   communications, the level of interest in issues Oxfam cares about, and
   the level of social media activity resulting from media stories about
   Oxfam or Oxfam/NGO activities. We use the native reporting tools of the
   social media networks, but may also use third-party tools.  Oxfam uses
   such tools to respond directly to other users’ queries and comments
   related to Oxfam.

How do we protect your data

   We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to
   protect your personal details. For example, our online forms are always
   encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored.

   We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we
   hold to ensure that your information is only accessible by
   appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.

   Where we use external companies to collect or process personal data on
   our behalf, we put a contract in place that sets out our expectations
   and requirements in relation to security of the data they access or
   process.  These organizations - referred to as "Data Processors" also
   have legal liability for the way in which your data is used, providing
   you with additional protection.

How long do we keep your data

   We will only retain the data you provide to us through our website for
   as long as required by applicable laws or as is necessary for the
   purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with any consents
   provided. We will delete personal data at the end of this period unless
   we wish to use it for statistical purposes, in which case we will
   anonymise it, such that you could never be re-identified with it.

Your rights

   You have the right to request details of the information we hold about
   you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal
   information, please make a request to our Data Protection officer at
   the details provided below. We will provide this information to you
   without charge, unless requests are manifestly unfounded, repetitive or
   excessive, in which case we are entitled to charge an administration
   fee.

   You also have a right to have inaccurate information we hold about you
   rectified or removed and a right, in some circumstances, to restrict or
   object to us processing your information, or to seek erasure of your
   data. If you believe we are not respecting your rights, you are
   entitled to make a complaint to a relevant supervisory authority.

   The legal basis on which we hold and use your data will vary depending
   on the activity involved. In some cases, we might hold the data because
   it is needed to fulfil a contract or meet our legal obligations (i.e. a
   donation), in others because it is in Oxfam’s legitimate interest to do
   so, and in others, because you have consented to this use. We note that
   the legal basis on which we process your data will influence your
   specific rights.

Changes to this notice

   We may make changes to this notice from time to time. We will always
   detail, at the end of this notice, the date it was last updated and you
   should check back from time to time.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Afghanistan

   Schoolgirls in Afghanistan

   Visit our regional website Oxfam in Asia

   Despite significant improvements since 2001, Afghanistan remains one of
   the poorest countries in the world; with nearly 40 percent of the
   population living below the poverty line. Government institutions are
   weak and unable to deliver basic services.

   Participation of women in decision making and in other spheres of
   society remains limited. Violence against women is still a major
   challenge in Afghanistan. Women continue to be brutally punished by
   different forms of violence. Access to health facilities is poor and
   access to quality education and a lack of female teachers are other
   major challenges in Afghanistan which cause a high number of girls to
   drop out of schools.

Oxfam in Afghanistan

   Oxfam first provided support in Afghanistan in 1961 and has been
   directly providing humanitarian and development assistance in the
   country since 1991, including during the Taliban rule. We currently
   work in Kabul and other seven provinces of the country: Balkh,
   Daikundi, Herat, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar and Takhar. Through our
   local partners, Oxfam provides assistance to families and communities
   affected by natural and man-made disasters. We work with poor
   communities to help them pull themselves out of poverty and improve
   their lives. We promote the rights of women and youth to become agents
   of change and fight for their rights. In a critical but constructive
   way, Oxfam works with government institutions to build capacity and
   influence policies that will help address structural poverty and
   inequality. To create lasting change, together with our partners also
   speak out on behalf of marginalized groups at the highest levels in
   both Afghanistan and among the international community.

   Working in and on conflict

   Afghanistan remains a country in conflict, which manifests itself every
   day in various forms and at different levels. Therefore, conflict
   sensitivity and conflict transformation lie at the heart of Oxfam’s
   work in Afghanistan. For us, conflict sensitivity means fully
   understanding the context in which we operate. We constantly assess how
   our work affects conflict dynamics, aiming to avoid negative impact,
   and maximize positive effects. Aspiring to produce positive and
   peaceful outcomes, Oxfam’s central focus is on conflict transformation.
   Through our programs and the relationships, we build with and between
   Afghan people and power holders, we constantly seek to address some of
   the key driving factors of conflict.

   We work in four thematic areas:
     * Economic justice: Oxfam especially works with marginalized groups
       such as small farmers and women headed households to improve their
       lives by building sustainable livelihoods, increasing their access
       to markets, and building resilience to climate change. We promote
       fair and equal access to natural resources as a way to address some
       of the root causes of conflict.

     * Gender Justice: Oxfam promotes the rights of youth and women to
       enable them to have a voice, participate in decision making
       processes and constructively work with the government to improve
       and promote policies that foster inclusive security, peace building
       and justice.

     * Governance: Oxfam promotes and strengthen the constructive
       engagement of civil society with the district, provincial and
       national levels of government to improve and support the delivery
       of essential services in line with people’s needs and with an
       overarching goal to address some of the key drivers of conflict.

     * Humanitarian: Afghanistan is highly vulnerable to natural and
       man-made disasters including drought, floods, and conflict. From
       another hand, the recent influx of more than 2 million of Afghan
       returnees from Pakistan and Iran in the period of just two years,
       further exacerbates the challenges. Oxfam works with Afghans
       affected by natural and man-made disasters and Afghan returnees to
       rebuild their lives and become more resilient to shocks. Oxfam
       provides aid through programs focused on Water, Sanitation, and
       Hygiene (WASH), Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), protection, food
       security, cash assistance, and broader livelihood support.

Returning to fragility: exploring the link between conflict and returnees in
Afghanistan
       31 January 2018
       Huge numbers of people are returning to Afghanistan – more than two
       million since 2015 – while the country is still highly fragile.
       Oxfam’s field research finds that for as long as these conditions
       do not improve, a safe and dignified return cannot be guaranteed,
       and forced returns remain irresponsible.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Armenia

   armeniacp

   Oxfam has been working in Armenia since 1994, to improve the lives and
   livelihoods of poor people, particularly those living in rural and
   isolated parts of the country.

   A devastating earthquake in 1988, and the collapse of the Soviet Union
   three years later left the country in a fragile state- and conflict
   with neighboring Azerbaijan has pushed the country further into
   poverty. Corruption, social injustice and economic inequalities
   continue to affect the lives of the most vulnerable people living in
   borderline, poverty stricken areas.

Oxfam in Armenia

   We work with local partners to stimulate investment in rural economies
   and challenge inequality. We support farmers to gain access to markets
   and secure fair prices for their produce and work to empower people to
   influence decisions affecting their lives.

   We currently have four key program areas:
     * Economic Justice: To challenge economic inequality we promote
       sustainable livelihoods for smallholder farmers, by supporting
       collective cooperatives and improving access to a wider range of
       support services and markets. We also work to increase food and
       income security for the most marginalized people in rural Armenia.

     * Supporting community resilience in Armenia – We work to establish a
       culture of safety and resilience within local communities to
       increase disaster resilience and reduce vulnerability by supporting
       strategies which enable them to prepare for, mitigate and respond
       to natural disasters.

     * Strengthening the civil society in Armenia – We empower civil
       society organizations to advocate and campaign reform which
       benefits poor and marginalized people and to engage in effective,
       transparent and substantial policy dialogue with national
       Government.

     * Emergency Housing Assistance to Armenian families displaced from
       Syria – To address the immediate housing and psycho-social needs of
       vulnerable refugee households, displaced from Syria, in Armenia and
       to contribute to the development of long term housing and
       employment for refugee populations.

Inequality and essential services
       From campaigning to end the financial secrecy that shelters
       trillions hidden in tax havens, to encouraging investment in
       universal education and healthcare – Oxfam is working to make sure
       that the poor get a share of the power and resources that will help
       to reduce poverty and inequality.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Albania

   Albania

   Albania is located in the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe (SEE).
   This country of nearly 2.9 million inhabitants finds itself at a
   crossroads today. Despite significant accomplishments, the quality of
   its democracy remains fragile. The future prospects of the country will
   largely depend on its government’s ability to produce good governance,
   pursue greater economic growth, ensure rule of law and tackle
   corruption with much more vigour.

   Albania is facing widespread poverty and social adversities. The
   unemployment rate in Albania is 28.7%, and 15% of the population are
   living below the poverty line.
   In rural areas there are low rates of poverty reduction, aside from the
   numerous factors contributing to poverty, woman’s inferior social and
   economic position has also had a strong impact. The current status of
   women bears specific significance in the stagnation and prolongation of
   poverty in Albania.

   Traditionally, women in Albania mostly take on a burden of their
   family's well-being and yet they have fewer opportunities than men to
   access the resources which could help them to meet these
   responsibilities. The high unemployment rate amongst women in Albania
   stems from various factors: poor educational attainment and vocational
   training, poor social status in the family and the domestic violence
   that they are subjected to limit their access to job market and
   participation in public and political structures.

   Following Albania's opening up in 1991, emigration from the country and
   immigration from rural areas to the cities accelerated the
   disintegration of  the traditional patriarchal family, with three
   generations sharing one home. However, patriarchal traditions  on
   issues related to unemployment, poverty and personal safety still
   remain  and Albanian women and girls, particularly in rural  and poor
   areas, are still being denied many fundamental rights.

Oxfam in Albania

   Oxfam works with local partners to alleviate poverty focusing on
   capacity building of local authorities and of civil society
   organizations as well as supporting local sustainable development to
   ensure citizens can exercise their rights and improve their living
   conditions.

   We address the risk of more people falling below the poverty line by
   improving access to better opportunities and resources to the most
   vulnerable, isolated and socially excluded groups of people without
   stable income.

   We aim  to strengthen women’s participation in the economy and to help
   them become actors of change, promoting sustainable development and
   participating in decision-making policies.

   We support the improved implementation of environmental standards and
   innovative natural resources management, to impact upon climate change
   and increase the resilience of rural, urban and vulnerable women and
   men.

   Our work in Albania is based on the needs of local communities,
   identified through years of experience and cooperation with partners in
   the region. There are four basic approaches we apply in our work:
     * Participatory approach and social equity: those most affected
       should have a leading role and actively participate in the decision
       making process.

     * Empowering: Citizens, and women in particular, should be empowered
       to make informed decisions and choices that will help them overcome
       common problems.

     * Networking: Networking is essential for sharing and learning about
       already existing experiences in the same sector and should help
       identify and develop better practices and policies.

     * Public-private partnership: The public-private partnership model
       allows public money to be spent in a more efficient way, and
       encourages the local civil society to become leader in the problem
       solving process regarding their communities.

   The Oxfam team in Albania is part of the Oxfam regional office in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. We work together in both countries, where we
   are present since early 1990s.

Gender justice and women’s rights
       Whether we are responding to an emergency, working on long terms
       projects with communities, or campaigning for lasting change, we
       tackle the inequality and deep-rooted discrimination that makes and
       keeps women poor.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Algeria

   Amadou is 24 from Mali.He left his country in 2013, heading first to
   Burkina Faso, then to Niger, and via Arlit to Algeria.
   Visit our regional website Oxfam in the Middle East & North Africa (in
   Arabic)

   Since 1975 Algeria has hosted a large proportion of the Sahrawi
   population in refugee camps near the city of Tindouf, the majority of
   whom are dependent on humanitarian aid to sustain basic needs such as
   access to food, water, and shelter. The camps are situated in a
   particularly hostile environment, with temperatures reaching up to 55
   degrees Celsius in July and August, frequent sandstorms, constant
   drought and rare but devastating torrential rains. As a result,
   refugees suffer from persistent levels of food insecurity and
   malnutrition and have limited opportunities for self-reliance.

Oxfam in Algeria

   The Sahrawi refugee camps have existed in southwest Algeria for over 40
   years, with almost 3 generations of refugees born and raised within
   them. Oxfam has been active in the camps since 1975, and over the
   years, our work has evolved from emergency aid to the multifaceted
   provision of humanitarian support, resilience and capacity building
   activities.

Improving Food Security and Self-Reliance

   Oxfam in Algeria aims to ensure that the Sahrawi refugee population
   sees its food security strengthened through improved access to,
   availability, and use of fresh produce in order to ensure diversity in
   their diet.
   Oxfam supports the distribution of fresh vegetables over the summer
   months, as well as the distribution of gluten-free flour to the celiac
   population. The complementary development of small-scale agroecological
   farming has allowed for increased training and sensitization of Sahrawi
   families on local food production and contributes to a reduction in the
   structural dependence of vulnerable refugees.
   Oxfam is also piloting the development of hydroponic agriculture in the
   region to provide green fodder for livestock. In only seven days, fresh
   green barley fodder can be produced from seeds using minimal quantities
   of water, no soil, and no fertilizer, resulting in improved access,
   quality, and quantity of animal products for the benefit of the Sahrawi
   population. Oxfam is also currently exploring the use of this
   technology to produce harvests for human consumption.

Supporting Youth and Community Engagement

   Oxfam in Algeria is endeavoring to increase the opportunities for
   Sahrawi youth to become actors of change in their communities and
   relieve the suffering of everyday life. Many young women and men in the
   camps have a high level of education, and yet they have limited
   opportunities for employment or participation in society. This
   situation, combined with the lack of advancement of the political
   process and the harsh living conditions, has fueled increasing
   frustration among young refugees.
   In 2018, Oxfam launched a youth-led community engagement project to
   support Sahrawi refugees to identify their greatest needs and provide
   them with an opportunity to address these. Through training in a range
   of topics, including communication, fund-raising, project management,
   and teamwork, the project aims to increase self-confidence among youth
   within the refugee camps and encourage civic participation. The project
   allows participants to be active, rather than passive, beneficiaries
   and demonstrates the power they have to bring about positive change
   within their communities by encouraging diverse and inclusive
   participation from across all sectors of Sahrawi society.
   Oxfam is also working in cooperation with other partners to fight youth
   frustration through the provision of alternative opportunities for
   community engagement and active citizenship. Project activities include
   the facilitation of international exchange sessions with youth
   activists and civil society members, the promotion of dialogue with
   local institutions and leaders, participation in international fora and
   events, and the promotion of local entrepreneurship, among others.

Advocating  for an equitable and sustainable political solution

   In addition to its programming within the Sahrawi refugee camps in
   Algeria, Oxfam continues to raise awareness about the severe
   humanitarian situation that the Sahrawi refugees are facing in the
   camps and to advocate for a more dignified life for refugees as well as
   a resolution of the conflict in order to address the root causes of the
   crisis.   In this regard, Oxfam calls for the improved quantity and
   quality of humanitarian aid and advocates for the achievement of a fair
   and sustainable political solution to the conflict, in accordance with
   international law.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Azerbaijan

   azerbaijancp

   Azerbaijan is located in South-West Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, as
   well as Russia, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey and Iran. Despite the
   country’s oil revenue, poor people in Azerbaijan remain plagued by high
   unemployment and a lack of essential services.

   The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the conflict with
   neighboring Armenia have both crippled the country’s infrastructure.
   With a population of 8.3 million, 11% of people live below the poverty
   line.

Oxfam in Azerbaijan

   Oxfam has been working in Azerbaijan since the early 1990s in response
   to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the conflict with neighbor
   Armenia which created a wave of displacement.

   Oxfam's work in Azerbaijan is helping by:
     * Rebuilding the lives of internally displaced people and refugees.

     * Helping to form farm cooperatives (in partnership with Unilever) to
       help producers move from subsistence to sustainability.

     * Increasing the influence of local communities to make the
       government more accountable.

     * Increasing resilience to natural disasters.

   The program will contribute to people living in poverty becoming
   healthy, secure, dignified, and able to realize their potential.

Inequality and essential services
       From campaigning to end the financial secrecy that shelters
       trillions hidden in tax havens, to encouraging investment in
       universal education and healthcare – Oxfam is working to make sure
       that the poor get a share of the power and resources that will help
       to reduce poverty and inequality.

Creating lasting change
       People can escape poverty - permanently. We think that everybody,
       every day, should be able to eat...
