Complaints handling process


   WW Australasia is committed to providing excellent customer service and
   maintaining healthy customer relationships and as such has developed a
   Customer Complaints Policy to ensure all complaints, or expressions of
   dissatisfaction received are handled as efficiently and effectively as
   possible.

   The following highlights our Policy and process for handling verbal and
   written complaints received.


   WW Australasia Customer Complaints Policy
   WW Australasia have established the following Customer Complaints
   Policy and is a company committed to;
    1. Providing our customers with an efficient, fair, accessible and
       structured process for complaints management.
    2. Ensuring customer complaints are processed in line with privacy
       laws and will apply a high level of confidentially.
    3. Providing our employees with a framework, training and system to
       work with when receiving a customer complaint.
    4. Acknowledging all customer complaints received by telephone, e-mail
       or website within 1 business day of receipt and will resolve most
       customer complaints within 14 business days; however this Policy
       provides provision for 21 business days where further investigation
       is required for more complex complaints or reliance on external
       providers such as business partners, licensees or WW global
       counterparts.
    5. Assigning a severity level for the customer complaint (minor,
       major, critical) and we will keep the customer informed as to the
       progress of the complaint and expected resolution timeframe.
    6. Regularly reviewing complaint reports and preventative action taken
       so that we can improve our processes, procedures, products,
       services and customer service even further based on customer
       complaints and feedback received.

   Lodgement of Complaints
   The WW Customer Service Team should be the customer’s first point of
   contact who will provide customers with information and assistance to
   ensure that any complaint received is lodged effectively. Complaints to
   WW Australasia can be lodged in the following ways;
     * By calling us on 13 19 97 in Australia, or, 0800 009 009 in New
       Zealand
     * By writing to us at Locked Bag 2020, Broadway, NSW, 2007 in
       Australia, or WWPO Box 25604 Wellington, 6146, New Zealand
     * By e-mailing us at customerservice@weightwatchers.com.au or
       customerservice@weightwatchers.co.nz
     * By visiting our website at ww.com/au or ww.com/nz

   All complaints received within the WW Customer Service Centre by
   telephone, e-mail or website will be acknowledged within 1 business
   day. WW will send the customer an email highlighting the complaint
   reference number to be used to identify progress with the complaint
   until a resolution is achieved. WW has established, and will continue
   to develop quality processes for the efficient and effective
   acknowledgment and processing of complaints received.

   Response to Complaints
   All complaints received by WW Australasia will be processed in an
   efficient and timely manner. Continuous improvement and on-going
   training will be executed to ensure all complaints received are
   resolved promptly, professionally and courteously. Managing our
   customer’s expectation is WW primary objective which will involve
   careful examination and a thorough investigation of each complaint
   received and a resolution offered on the basis of the investigation and
   outcome.

   WW Complaints Handling
   We will capture all of the relevant information in a secure site in
   accordance to our Privacy Policy. A Reference Number will be assigned
   to the complaint and summary e-mailed to the customer. Complaints
   received will be captured and analysed to ensure that complaints
   received are compliant with this Customer Complaints Policy. Systemic
   trends and any re-occurring problems will be identified and forwarded
   to the relevant department, person or licensee/business partner to
   provide them with the opportunity to improve existing processes,
   procedures, products, services and customer service.

   Time frame for Complaint Resolution
   WW Customer Service Team will acknowledge receipt of a customer
   complaint received by telephone, e-mail or website within 1 business
   day. Most complaints received by WW Australasia are generally resolved
   within 14 business days from the date of receipt – as per Weight
   Management Council of Australia; however, we ask customers to allow WW
   Australasia up to 21 business days where further investigation may be
   required. As described in section 4 of the WW Customer Complaints
   Policy.

   Escalation of Complaints
   WW Australasia’s goal for complaints handling is to resolve complaints
   at first point of contact. Where elected customers will be kept
   informed regarding the progress of their complaint and WW Australasia’s
   internal complaint escalation process. WW Australasia requests that
   customers provide us with an opportunity to resolve their complaint
   before escalating their complaint. If a customer believes they have
   exhausted all avenues for addressing their complaint with WW
   Australasia or if they find those avenues unacceptable for any reason
   they will be advised of external channels for escalation such as
     * Department of Fair Trading in your state,
     * Australian Comp and Consumer Commission,
     * Commonwealth Ombudsman
     * Seek independent legal advice from a solicitor as an alternative
       avenue for resolution.

   Invite a friend Instructions & Terms:


   Share your personal invitation link with your friends. As soon as your
   friend purchases a WW 3-Month Plan through your link, you will receive
   a confirmation email that your friend has joined.


   *Free Additional Month Terms:

   To be eligible for the free additional month, your friend must purchase
   a new WW 3-Month Plan and continue for at least 2 weeks after purchase
   and must be 18 years or older and not a current member. Your membership
   must be active at the time of processing. If these criteria are met,
   you will receive an email confirming your free additional month, which
   will be applied by extending your next recurring billing date by one
   month. Processing may take up to 2 – 4 weeks. This offer is not
   transferable or redeemable for cash. If you are on a multi-month plan,
   the plan period will extend by one month, regardless of when the time
   credit is applied and the terms of the plan purchased still apply. This
   offer cannot be combined with other joining offers for new or rejoining
   members.

   Cancellation of memberships remains subject to the WW Cancellation &
   Refunds Policy accessible here.

   TRUSTe Privacy Certification
   ^A randomised controlled trial found that after one year, those on
   Weight Watchers (WW; meetings and digital tools) who completed the
   study lost significantly more weight than those who received
   weight-loss advice from their physicians, which is standard care.
