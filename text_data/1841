About Compressed Archive Formats

   Compressed archives combine multiple files into a single file to make
   them easier to transport or save on diskspace. Archiving software may
   also provide options for encryption, file spanning, checksums,
   self-extraction, and self-installation. Zip is the most-widely used
   format, used by the Windows operating system and more recently by OSX
   as well. RAR is also a very popular and flexible format. Unix uses the
   tar file format, while Linux uses the tar and gz format.

About Compressed Archive Formats

   Compressed archives combine multiple files into a single file to make
   them easier to transport or save on diskspace. Archiving software may
   also provide options for encryption, file spanning, checksums,
   self-extraction, and self-installation. Zip is the most-widely used
   format, used by the Windows operating system and more recently by OSX
   as well. RAR is also a very popular and flexible format. Unix uses the
   tar file format, while Linux uses the tar and gz format.
