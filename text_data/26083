   October 16 K 2019 (Kunststoffe) Düsseldorf (Germany) 10/16/2019 to
   10/23/2019 Arkema’s polymers and additives play a part in the vast
   majority of industries - automotive, electronics, furniture,
   construction, packaging, medical applications and the energies sector -
   seeking cutting edge performances materials. They help manufacture
   increasingly sturdy, light and durable components, often replacing
   metal or glass, that are heavier and raise higher processing costs.
   With its extensive range of technical polymers of renewable origin at
   the forefront, Arkema will be exhibiting at the upcoming Kunststoffe
   2019 tradeshow on booth 6C57 its whole high-performance polymers and
   additives portfolio, showcased by markets and applications.
   October 23 Sepawa Berlin, Germany 10/23/2019 to 10/25/2019 For the
   detergency market, Arkema offers surfactants and rheology additives
   (Coatex). Arkema’s expertise and 60 years of research make it a leader
   in the nonionic and cationic surfactant sector, producing many
   innovative solutions for Home and Professional Care formulations.
   Arkema has expertise in two main technologies: - Functionalised fatty
   amines (quarternisation, salification, alkoxylation, etc.) -
   Alkoxylates (produced from the reaction between ethylene oxide,
   propylene or butylene oxide with natural or synthetic substrates such
   as fatty alcohols or sorbitan esters) These products encompass a wide
   range of surfactant properties: thickening for acidic gels, wetting,
   dispersing, solubilizing, foaming/low foaming and detergency. Don't
   miss out our presentation "Innovative Bio-Based Surfactants for
   Cleaning Product Applications. When Sustainability Comes with
   Cost-Effective Performance!" on Thursday, 24 October (from 10:00610:15
   in Room 1)

   International Petroleum Exhibition and Conferences brings together
   players from Oil, Petroleum & Gas and Energy sectors. Arkema has key
   brands that address issues confronting the oil & gas industry.
   Prochinor is a powerful demulsifiers and desalting additives used to
   separate water from crude oil. Norust goes hand in hand with this as it
   protects the gas and oil production installations against internal
   corrosion. Inipol AD is another important product which serves to
   prevent the formation of mineral and organic scale during production.
   Thiochemicals, with its wide range of products from hydro treating
   catalyst (DMDS Evolution E2) to breakthrough formulation in sulfiding
   agents, done by highly trained Carelflex technicians, has their own
   niche in the oil & gas and petrochemicals industries. Spotleak (natural
   gas) and Vigileak & Ethyl Mercaptan (LPG) are used to help detect leaks
   which is imperative in handling safely odorant chemicals.

   October 16 K 2019 (Kunststoffe) Düsseldorf (Germany) 10/16/2019 to
   10/23/2019 Arkema’s polymers and additives play a part in the vast
   majority of industries - automotive, electronics, furniture,
   construction, packaging, medical applications and the energies sector -
   seeking cutting edge performances materials. They help manufacture
   increasingly sturdy, light and durable components, often replacing
   metal or glass, that are heavier and raise higher processing costs.
   With its extensive range of technical polymers of renewable origin at
   the forefront, Arkema will be exhibiting at the upcoming Kunststoffe
   2019 tradeshow on booth 6C57 its whole high-performance polymers and
   additives portfolio, showcased by markets and applications.
   October 23 Sepawa Berlin, Germany 10/23/2019 to 10/25/2019 For the
   detergency market, Arkema offers surfactants and rheology additives
   (Coatex). Arkema’s expertise and 60 years of research make it a leader
   in the nonionic and cationic surfactant sector, producing many
   innovative solutions for Home and Professional Care formulations.
   Arkema has expertise in two main technologies: - Functionalised fatty
   amines (quarternisation, salification, alkoxylation, etc.) -
   Alkoxylates (produced from the reaction between ethylene oxide,
   propylene or butylene oxide with natural or synthetic substrates such
   as fatty alcohols or sorbitan esters) These products encompass a wide
   range of surfactant properties: thickening for acidic gels, wetting,
   dispersing, solubilizing, foaming/low foaming and detergency. Don't
   miss out our presentation "Innovative Bio-Based Surfactants for
   Cleaning Product Applications. When Sustainability Comes with
   Cost-Effective Performance!" on Thursday, 24 October (from 10:00610:15
   in Room 1)

   International Petroleum Exhibition and Conferences brings together
   players from Oil, Petroleum & Gas and Energy sectors. Arkema has key
   brands that address issues confronting the oil & gas industry.
   Prochinor is a powerful demulsifiers and desalting additives used to
   separate water from crude oil. Norust goes hand in hand with this as it
   protects the gas and oil production installations against internal
   corrosion. Inipol AD is another important product which serves to
   prevent the formation of mineral and organic scale during production.
   Thiochemicals, with its wide range of products from hydro treating
   catalyst (DMDS Evolution E2) to breakthrough formulation in sulfiding
   agents, done by highly trained Carelflex technicians, has their own
   niche in the oil & gas and petrochemicals industries. Spotleak (natural
   gas) and Vigileak & Ethyl Mercaptan (LPG) are used to help detect leaks
   which is imperative in handling safely odorant chemicals.
