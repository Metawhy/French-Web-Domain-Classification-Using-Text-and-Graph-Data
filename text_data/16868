   A real-time journey through the first landing on the Moon
   Introduction

   This website replays the Apollo 11 mission as it happened, 50 years
   ago. It consists entirely of historical material, all timed to Ground
   Elapsed Time--the master mission clock. Footage of Mission Control,
   film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from
   space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to
   the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every
   photograph taken, and every word spoken.
   Interface

   Upon starting the application, select whether to begin one minute
   before launch, or click "Now" to drop in exactly 50 years ago,
   to-the-second during the anniversary.

   Navigate to any moment of the mission using the time navigator at the
   top of the screen. The top bar is the entire mission with two bars
   below it providing magnification. Selecting transcript items, photos,
   commentary items, or guided tour moments, also jumps the mission time
   to the moment they occurred.

   Main mission audio consists of space-to-ground (left ear), capcom loop
   (right ear), and on-board recorder (center, when available). Selecting
   a Mission Control audio channel mutes the main audio, opens the Mission
   Control audio panel, and plays the "live" audio of that Mission Control
   position. Change channels by selecting the seats in mission control.
   Closing the Mission Control audio panel will unmute the main audio and
   continue mission playback.

   These 50 channels of Mission Control audio have only recently been
   digitized and restored, and are made publicly available here for the
   first time. They total over 11,000 hours in length.

   Please contact Ben Feist for any inquiries.

   "I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the
   human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner
   soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim
   upstream."
   — Neil Armstrong
   Commander, Apollo 11
   "Space is not just going up and coming back down again. Space is
   getting into orbit and being there, living there, establishing a
   presence, a permanence."
   — Buzz Aldrin
   Lunar Module Pilot, Apollo 11
   "I knew I was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before."
   — Michael Collins
   Command Module Pilot, Apollo 11
