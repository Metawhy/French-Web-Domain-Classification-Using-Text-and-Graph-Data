   ARCTIC: NEW FRONTIER - by Kadir van Lohuizen and Yuri Kozyrev Cape
   Kamenny Russia May 2018 Gazprom Neft's "Arctic Gate" terminal in Gulf
   of Ob the Novoportovskoye is one of the biggest oil fields in the Yamal
   Peninsula. The field is located 30 km from the coast of the Ob bay, and
   oil is transported by pipeline to Cape Kamenny where a terminal
   facility has been developed. The company Gazprom Neft is operating the
   Novy Port project, which is built to be able to deliver up to eight
   million tons of oil per year. A fleet of six tankers are being built
   for the Novy Port. The first vessels of the new fleet, the «Shturman
   Albanov» and the «Shturman Malygin» were put on the water in early
   2016. The third fleet tanker, the “Shturman Ovtsyn” set course for the
   history books when it in mid-winter 2017 left the yard of the Samsung
   Heavy Industries in South Korea, made it through the Bering Strait and
   sailed all the way to Yamal. Later, also the «Shturman Shcherbinin» and
   the «Shturman Koshelev» were built.

   Wasteland - by Kadir van Lohuizen Nigeria, Lagos, 27 January 2017 A man
   carries a huge back of pet bottles collected for recycling at the
   Olusosun landfill. The Olusosun landfill in Lagos receives between
   3-5000 tons per day and is about 45 ha in size. About 5000 scavengers
   work here and often also live. They collect anything that is recyable
   like plastics, textiles, electronics, paper etc. The problem is that
   the landfill is full and the city wants to close it down. The question
   is where it will go, there are no incinerators and the infrastructure
   to formally recycle is lacking. There is one other landfill, but it
   needs to close as well. Remarkable is that the landfills in Lagos smell
   less compared to other landfills in the world: Nigerians throw away
   less food, because they either finish their plate or feed it to the
   animals. Kadir van Lohuizen / NOOR
