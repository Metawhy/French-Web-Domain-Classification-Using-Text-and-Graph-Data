   unwinding in a luxury European spa or learning to cook fish benachin in
   Africa. Join me as I discover new countries, cultures and cuisines.

   My Favourite Things to Eat in Dubai

My Favourite Things to Eat in Dubai

   With around 200 nationalities living in Dubai it’s no surprise that the
   choice of things to eat here is diverse. This exciting city, as I found
   out earlier in the year at the Emirate’s annual food festival, is fast

   first-rate restaurants, serving a huge range of cuisines and catering
   for every budget too; not every meal will leave you in your credit
   card’s bad books (although some most definitely will). Having met with
   a number of chefs, talked to locals and visited a wide range of venues,
   here’s my guide to all my edible favourites in this exciting city.
