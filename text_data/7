About this bundle

   [ ]

   Introducing the Hand Drawn Display Bundle by Adam Ladd, a collection of
   32 unique fonts ideal for headlines that call for a human touch. There
   are a range of styles to choose from—script, sans, serif,
   ornaments—that can be mixed and matched to fit the need. The common
   thread for all of them is that they’ve been created by hand. The
   organic, craftsman qualities are evident at large sizes, but they have
   also been carefully drawn to keep readability in mind.

   Whether it’s food packaging, a headline for publishing in books and
   magazines, or a lifestyle brand and website, these fonts will be a
   useful toolkit to add typographic expression to your designs.

Fort Foundry

   Fort is built by Mattox Shuler and based out of Athens, GA. It began as
   a fun side-project exploring what it takes to create a typeface. After
   a few feeble, yet amusing attempts, Fort put out its first professional
   typeface in early 2013 through distributors like MyFonts.

   From there, the foundry quickly and surprisingly took off with that
   initial typeface and each subsequent release making their way onto “Hot
   New Fonts” lists. The side-project soon became a full-time endeavor and
   passion to build well-crafted type. During its first year, the foundry
   went under the name of Hold Fast Foundry with its sole focus on type
   design.

   A desire had been welling up over that first year to do something
   more—to connect the digital nature of producing type with something
   physical for people to enjoy. That idea brought about the launch of
   Fort Foundry.

   From time to time, Fort produces limited edition type specimens in the
   form of apparel, posters, or books to go alongside the release of a new
   typeface.
