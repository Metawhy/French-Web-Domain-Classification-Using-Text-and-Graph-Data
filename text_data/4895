What is Browsershots?

   Browsershots makes screenshots of your web design in different
   operating systems and browsers. It is a free open-source online web
   application providing developers a convenient way to test their
   website's browser compatibility in one place. When you submit your web
   address, it will be added to the job queue. A number of distributed
   computers will open your website in their browser. Then they will make
   screenshots and upload them to our central dedicated server for your
   review.
