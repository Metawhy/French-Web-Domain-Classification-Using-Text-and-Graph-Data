       stored on your device, we assign a unique cookie ID to that device.
       See the “Cookies” section below and our Cookies policy (available
       here) for further information on our use of cookies.


   How is your data collected?

   As you interact with a Client Campaign, we automatically collect

   How we use your data

   campaigns. Further information on how we use cookies with our partners
   is set out in the cookies section below.

   We also aggregate your cookie ID with the anonymous cookie IDs we
   receive from other individuals interacting with a particular Client
   Campaign. We use these aggregated Cookie IDs to provide our clients
   with an estimation of the unique number of visitors to that Client
   Campaign. Aggregating data in this way enables us and our clients to
   understand the effectiveness of their Client Campaigns.


   Our basis for processing your data

   We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We have
   set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan

   do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where
   appropriate.

   ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your
   data.

   Cookies

   A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent
   to your device when you visit a website. We and/or our third-party
   partners may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your
   web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until
   you delete them or they expire – usually after 1 year).  Further detail
   in relation to the cookies that we may use are set out in our cookies
   policy here.

   We and our partners use cookies to provide you with the best possible
   user experience, and also to track your online activity for the
   following :
     * To establish whether you are an existing survey panel member.  The
       cookie ID we assign to the device you use to interact with a Client
       Campaign will tell us whether or not you have previously agreed to
       complete surveys for us. If you are a member of the GlobalWebIndex
       panel, we will process the information collected through our
       tracking of cookies in accordance with our Survey Privacy Policy

       mentioned above, we use cookies to track the number of unique
       visitors to a Client Campaign.

   Important note about cookies: We always want you to be in control of
   the information you share with us, and there are a number of ways that
   you can remove or block cookies at any time, including by following the
   help file directions in your internet browser. But if you want to tell
   us right now that you don’t want us to use cookies, then you can
   opt-out of this process here.

   When you opt out, we delete the existing values in our cookie on your
   device and replace them with an “opt out” value which tells our server
   not to continue to track your behaviour, and we will ignore all
   subsequent requests coming from your browser. Please note that if you
   block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please
   also note that if you choose to opt-out now, but then at some point
   later you decide to delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if
   you use a different device or internet browser, you will need to renew
   your opt-out choice.

   If you decide you want to opt-out of our cookie process at some point
   in the future rather than now, you can always visit the original survey
   site where you were first invited to take part in one of our surveys,
   and tell them. Alternatively, you can come back to this Trendstream
   opt-out page. http://www.globalwebindex.net/gwiq/opt-out


   Disclosures of your personal data


   We may disclose your data to third parties such as:
     * Other members of our group of companies;
     * Authorised third-party service providers who provide IT and
       administration services to us to help us to provide our services;
     * Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and
       insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and
       accounting services; and
     * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge
       parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to
       acquire other businesses or merge with them.

   We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
   data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
   third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
   purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for
   specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. If a change
   happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data
   in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.

   International transfers

   We share your personal data with other companies within our group. This
   will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area
   (EEA). Some of our external third-party service providers are based
   outside the European EEA so their processing of your personal data will
   involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

   Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
   similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
   of the following safeguards is implemented:
     * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
       been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
       data by the European Commission.
     * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
       contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
       data adequate protection.
     * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
       them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
       provide an equivalent level of protection to personal data shared
       between the Europe and the US.

   Data security

   We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
   personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
   unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
   your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
   third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
   your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty
   of confidentiality.

   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
   data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
   breach where we are legally required to do so.

   How long will you use my personal data for?

   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
   fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
   satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

   To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
   consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
   potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
   personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
   whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
   applicable legal requirements.

   In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it
   can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
   purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely
   without further notice to you.

   Your legal rights

   Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws
   in relation to your personal data:
     * The right of access: your right to obtain confirmation as to
       whether or not personal data are being processed, and, where that
       is the case, access to the personal data along with details
       regarding the nature of processing.
     * The right of rectification: your right to obtain the rectification
       of inaccurate personal data.
     * The right of portability: your right to receive your personal data
       in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
     * The right to be forgotten: your right to erase your personal data.
       This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
       there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
     * The right to restrict processing: your right for your data to be
       effectively ‘frozen’; stored and not further processed.
     * The right to object: your right to object to how your personal data
       is processed where we are re relying on a legitimate interest (or
       those of a third party).

   Submit your right here:

   If you would like exercise one of your rights listed above please send
   an email to privacy@globalwebindex.com


   Please use the email template below to confirm the right you wish to
   exercise together with details of the data in respect of which you are
   exercising such right.


   Subject: <The right you would like to exercise>

   Body: <name>

   <The right you would like to exercise>

   <grounds for your request (where applicable)>

   <personal data which is subject to the rights request>

   What we may need from you

   Where you wish to exercise on of the rights listed above, we may need
   to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
   identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
   exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
   ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
   right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
   information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

   Where we are not able to determine with any degree of certainty whether
   the information requested by you relates exclusively to you, our
   disclosure of such information to you may pose a privacy risk to a
   third party (for example, where a cookie ID is associated with a device
   used by more than one person). We will assess each request to exercise
   any of the rights listed above individually on its merits and will
   disclose the requested information where we are satisfied that such
   disclosure does not represent a privacy risk to any third party.

   Other Things to Know

   We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
   treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
   Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not
   completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your
   data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us;
   and therefore any transmission is at your own risk.
