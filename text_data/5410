ROHM Semiconductor FDZ5.6 RASMID Zener Diode

   ROHM Semiconductor FDZ5.6 RASMID (ROHM Advanced Smart Micro Device)
   Zener Diode is housed in a compact, non-leaded 0402 (SOD-992,
   DSN0402-2) package, ideal for small portable and wearable electronic
   applications. The FDZ5.6 RASMID Zener Diode features high reliability,
   high protection levels of ±8kV, and a dimension tolerance of ±10um.
   ROHM RASMID diodes are designed using enhanced dicing methods, enabling
   minimal adhesion areas and increased mounting accuracy. Mounting errors
   and "tombstoning" are significantly by the use of bottom electrodes.
   The FDZ5.6 RASMID Zener Diode is lead free and RoHS compliant.

AVX VLAS Automotive TransGuard® Varistors

   AVX VLAS Automotive TransGuard® Varistors are multilayer varistors with
   low clamping to working voltage ratio. These varistors are AEC-Q200
   qualified and offer bi-directional ESD overvoltage protection as well
   as EMI/RFI attenuation in a single SMD package. The VLAS varistors
   exhibit low breakdown and provide enhanced protection for components
   with higher sensitivity to overvoltage. These varistors are available
   from 0603 to 1210 case sizes. Typical applications include
   infotainment, ECU, displays, microcontrollers, and low VC to VW ratio
   requirements.

AVX PrizmaCap™

   AVX PrizmaCap™ uses an activated carbon electrode and has a propylene
   carbonate (PC) based electrolyte with a paper separator and SMT leads.
   The PrizmaCap current collector is made of a special low ESR type
   aluminum. The PrizmaCap features cell voltage of ~2.1V/cell and 1.1V to
   2.4V rated voltage. Cap values are 1F to 500F. The PrizmaCap offers a
   low profile product, as thin as 0.5mm, with high energy, low ESR and
   LC, and high-temperature capabilities with an operating temperature of
   -55°C to +105°C.

Honeywell DPR TruStability™ Board Mount Pressure Sensors

   Honeywell Sensing & Control DPR TruStability™ Board Mount Pressure
   Sensors are piezoresistive silicon sensors offering a ratiometric
   analog output for reading pressure over the specified full scale
   pressure span and temperature range. These Honeywell sensors ±1.6mbar
   to ±25mbar / ±160Pa to ±2.5kPa / ±0.5inH2O to ±10inH2O pressure range.
   DPR sensors are fully calibrated and temperature compensated for sensor
   offset, sensitivity, temperature effects, and non-linearity using an
   on-board Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Calibrated
   output values for pressure are updated at approximately 1kHz. The
   series is calibrated over a -20°C to 70°C temperature range. The sensor
   is calibrated for operation from a single power supply of 5.0VDC. These
   sensors measure differential or gage pressures. The robust and durable
   housing is designed to withstand harsh application environments.
