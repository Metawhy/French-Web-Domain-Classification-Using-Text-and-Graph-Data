   About IFAC'2017, en Français

See you in Berlin!

   It was a pleasure to have you all in Toulouse for the 20th IFAC World
   Congress. The Congress activities will slowly calm down but information
   will continue to be posted at:
     * www.ifac2017.org - the site will be maintained for some time
     * twitter.com/IFAC2017 - the Twitter will be more silent than it was
       during the Congress week, but may react once in a while
     * www.flickr.com/photos/ifac2017 - have a look at the nice photos of
       the event
     * www.youtube.com/channel/UCLcWoqbVNxo9rVSS9NKQDeA - plenary and
       panel sessions on the IFAC YouTube channel

   But now it is time to foresee the future. Next World Congress is in
   Berlin: www.ifac2020.org. Looking forward to attending to this event.

Getting feedback from delegates

   The 20th IFAC World Congress ended on 14 July 2017. It has been a long,
   intense and exciting event to prepare and organize. While we are
   globally satisfied with the outcome, we acknowledge that some elements
   could have been better. But our satisfaction is mainly thanks to you
   the Congress delegates. Not only have you been many to register and
   attend the Congress, but also, by your kind and comprehensive attitude,
   you helped in making things go smoothly. Many thanks to you.

   One last request. Could take 5-10 minutes of your time for a short
   survey?
