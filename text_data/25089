   Tyre Michelin Pilot Street Radial

   Non contractual pictures

   The Michelin Pilot Street Radial tyre delivers excellent stability and
   handling thanks to flexible sidewalls that compensate for roadway
   deformations for increased comfort at high speed. Pressures in the
   radial tyre contact area are more efficiently distributed, which
   ultimately results in more even wear and longer-lasting performance.
   Excellent grip in sharp turns.
