Classroom Reveal 2017-2018

   Hello teacher friends! It has been the craziest summer for me.  I got
   married, bought a house, got a new job, switched grade levels . . .
   CRAZY.  So, I have been a little absent from my blog these days.
   However, I am so excited to show you my new classroom for the year!
   Because my name changed from Winter to Piper, I decided to change my
   theme too.  I have had a camping theme for the last four years, and I
   decided it was time to switch it up to Mrs. Piper's Pirates.  I also
   made the switch from 2nd to 1st grade.  Although I have changed themes
   and grade levels, I am keeping my blog and TPT store name as Camping
   Out In Second.  Check out my new classroom below and let me know what
   you think :)

    I am jumping on the train this year and starting Daily 5! I am loving
   it so far, and so are the kiddos.  Here are our book baskets.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.09%2BPM.png]
   Inside our book boxes, the students choose their own good fit books.  I
   also keep a Daily 5 checklist, and these amazing sight word booklets
   from the AMAZING Reagan Tunstall.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.18%2BPM.png]
    Instead of buying expensive pencil clips this year, I went with some
   cable clips from Amazon.  They are meant to hold phone cords. I will be
   honest, some of my students' clips have already fallen off :( But they
   are a cheap and easy way to hold pencils! 30 clips for $8.99 :)
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.25%2BPM.png]
    The perfect way to dress up ugly cabinets . . . student work! I used
   my Silhouette Machine to cut out my vinyl letters.  Thank you to The
   World of Mrs. B for the "Amazing Work Coming Soon" freebie!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.33%2BPM.png]
    Here is my transportation clip chart.  It says Yo, Ho, Ho, How are we
   going home? Cute and cheesy, just how I like it ;) You can find the
   labels in my Beginning of the Year Pirate Pack!
   This table is also where I keep our Daily 5 materials for Listen to
   Reading, Word Work, and Work on Writing. I also have my Captains of the
   Week displayed. These are my two helpers who do all of the classroom
   jobs for the week! I like how I only have to change two names instead
   of changing jobs for the whole class.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.40%2BPM.png]
    This phonics bulletin board is displayed behind my small group table.
    I used reading strategy signs from Deanna Jump.  You can also find
   these phonics posters in my TPT store.  They align to the Words Their
   Way curriculum.  Check them out HERE!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.49%2BPM.png]
    Here is my classroom library that I spent SO much time organizing this
   summer.  The book bins are labeled by book categories.  After reading
   the Daily 5 book, I learned that it is important to not have labeled
   book bins because the students will feel limited when choosing books.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.50.56%2BPM.png]
    However, I still level my books just so I can see the book level and
   help the students choose good fit books.  I use the Scholastic Book
   Wizard app to find the level.  So easy! The number on the bottom of the
   book tells the students which basket the book belongs to in my library.
   If they have a #16 book, they return it to the #16 box. Super easy way
   to keep your books organized!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.04%2BPM.png]
    If you have followed my previous blog posts, you know I love me some
   good anchor charts.  Here is my anchor chart wall.  They are organized
   in math, writing, language, reading, and phonics.  I am still using
   some 2nd grade charts, but I have been creating some new ones for my
   firsties!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.14%2BPM.png]
   Above each anchor chart section are my target boards.  They are just
   picture frames from the Dollar Tree with a piece of white printer paper
   inside! I write our daily targets using a dry erase marker.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.23%2BPM.png]
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.23%2BPM.png]
   This is the inside and outside of my classroom door.  Once again, my
   Silhouette Machine was such a huge help when decorating my classroom!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.57.52%2BPM.png]
    This is a bulletin board that we have used more than I expected! The
   first unit of math is all about number bonds, and my number bond
   mini-posters have been a great resources for my kiddos.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.57.59%2BPM.png]
    My (and the students') favorite part of the day! I was lucky enough to
   have a magnetic chalkboard to cover and use. To make their choice, the
   students just move their name and place it under their choice.  We also
   have our reading stamina chart displayed here.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.06%2BPM.png]
    Next up . . . small groups! I laminated these group papers so I can
   write student names and easily erase them to change groups if needed.
   These are also found in my Beginning of the Year Pirate Pack.   Hanging
   on the wall are my reading fluency phrase rings.  I created them using
   the Fry Words.  You can find these in my TPT store HERE!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.15%2BPM.png]
    To add some more reading spots to my room, I found some $7 rugs from
   the Dollar General.  This cute little chalkboard is from Wal-Mart, and
   I of course added vinyl :) I switch the names out every other day.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.46%2BPM.png]
   This has been the best way for me to keep pencils organized! Also, this
   is the BEST manual pencil sharpener from Classroom Friendly Supplies.
   They have fun colors, are student friendly, and they are reasonably
   priced! Check them out HERE.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.30%2BPM.png]
    This is my fifth year using the coin behavior system.  If the students
   earn a coin, they put a + on the chart.  If they lose one, they put a
   -.  At the end of the day, I record how many coins they earned/lost in
   their behavior calendars.  At the end of the week, the students shop
   for coupons to use in the classroom. The best part about it is all of
   the coupons are free and I don't have to keep buying treats and
   prizes!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.38%2BPM.png]
    This is one of my favorite additions to my classroom.  I place the
   upcoming birthdays on the filing cabinet.  On their birthday, they get
   to wear these cool glasses from Party City!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.51.44%2BPM.png]
   Have you figured out that I'm cheesy yet? :) What ARRRRGH you having
   for lunch?? You can find this label in my Beginning of the Year Pirate
   Pack!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.32%2BPM.png]
    My desk! I just used thick burlap ribbon and hot glued different types
   of fun ribbon to make a banner.  If you look closely, I also painted my
   own pirate rock this summer :)
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-11%2Bat%2B7.58.39%2BPM.png]
   Last but not least, my pirate ship! This was all made from butcher
   paper from the school, and I cut out the letters with my Silhouette
   Cameo.
   I have been through so many changes this year, but it is off to a great
   start! I am loving my firsties and can't wait to see them all grow.
   Thanks for stopping by!

Easy to Prep Two-Digit Subtraction Activities

   After four years of teaching second grade, one thing has stayed the
   same from year to year: my little munchkins always rock two-digit
   addition, but two-digit subtraction always seems to bring a struggle!
   Obviously, the only way to help the struggle is to practice over and
   over and over again, which can be exhausting for both the students and
   the teacher.  I'm all about making everything into a game.  Everything!
   When you call it a game, the kiddos are instantly engaged.  I've
   snapped some pictures of some of my favorite two-digit subtraction
   games and activities we've been using the past couple weeks!
   First up, we have an activity from my Second Grade GO Math Centers and
   Games: Chapter 5.   We used number lines to solve pizza slice equations
   to make a full pizza.  Everyone loves pizza and the kiddos mastered the
   number line. All of the games from my GO Math games are so easy to prep
   and use.  Check them out by clicking on the picture below!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2016-12-13%2Bat%2B7.33.09%2BPM.png]
   Next up is just some good ole fashioned practice.  These regrouping
   houses make this process so much easier for my kids! We also used my
   Second Grade Math Mini Anchor Charts to help us out.  It includes the
   following poem that I swear by:
   More on top? No need to stop!
   More on the floor? Go next door and get 10 more!
   Numbers the same? Zeros the game!
   [unnamed.jpg]
   You can also find these regrouping mats in my
    Second Grade GO Math Centers and Games: Chapter 5.
   Here is a close up of my mini anchor chart rings.  They take some time
   to make for each student, but I love that they each have their own
   resource! The anchor charts are created based on each common core
   standard, and are numbered on the back for easy access.  Check them out
   HERE or click the pictures below!
   [unnamed-1.jpg]
   [unnamed-2.jpg]
   Also using the regrouping mats from above, we played Race to Zero.
   This game is so simple with no prep, but the kiddos really got into it!
   You simply partner the students up and write several equations on the
   board.  Each partner picks a different equation to solve. The player
   who has an answer closest to zero earns a point for that round.  So
   easy and gives them lots of practice!
   [unnamed-3.jpg]
   This last game was more popular than I expected! I called it Circle
   Subtraction.  The students were paired up and given a laminated
   hundreds chart with two different colored dry erase markers.
   [unnamed-7.jpg]
    Each student would circle a number and then create a subtraction
   equation to solve together.  Then they would also circle the answer to
   their equation.  No number can be circled twice!
   [unnamed-8.jpg]
    I set a fun timer from a cool website called Online Stopwatch (which
   they always beg for).  They loved trying to fill up the whole board
   before the timer went off! Once again, SO easy with little prep, yet so
   effective.
   [unnamed-9.jpg]
   Now I don't know about you, but I can't do anything in December without
   incorporating something related to Christmas. These Two-Digit
   Subtraction Ornaments gave plenty of extra practice without the boring
   worksheet! All you have to do is use your artistic skills to draw a big
   Christmas tree and you're set :) Get these ornaments FREE by clicking
   the pictures below!
   [unnamed-4.jpg]
   [unnamed-5.jpg]
   [unnamed-6.jpg]
   Now for my favorite activity of the week! This might be the easiest
   craft I've done all year.  We have been solving two-digit subtraction
   word problems using part-part-whole maps, so I of course decided that
   our part-part-whole maps needed to be cute.  All you need to make these
   adorable reindeer are two hands and a foot! Just have the kiddos trace
   their foot onto brown paper, and then trace two hands onto white/cream
   paper.
   [IMG_1969.JPG]
   Add a nose and eyes and voila! Reindeer.  They each chose a word
   problem from their textbook to solve on their reindeer part-part-whole
   maps.  The antlers are the two parts and the head is the whole!

   Hands-on beats worksheets every time, y'all.  Comment below to share
   some of your favorite two-digit subtraction activities and games!

More and More Place Value

   Before we talk place value, I have to give a huge shout-out to Jolene
   at Paisley 'N' Polkadots.  She gave my blog a big makeover and I am in
   love! Click HERE to go check out her blog if you are interested in a
   new blog design.
   One of my favorite units to teach in second grade math is place value.
    It sets the base for all other math skills that we will use this year
   and there are SO many hands on ways to teach it.  Click HERE for a link
   to my post on how I introduce three-digit place value using straws!
   My most popular anchor chart that has been pinned over and over again
   on Pinterest is my Perry the Place Value Robot.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2016-10-08%2Bat%2B10.41.37%2BAM.png]
   He has been such a big hit that we of course had to make our own place
   value robots. Our AMAZING aide cut out all of the hundreds, tens, and
   ones for me.  I used the template from my Place Value Activity Packet,
   and printed them on colored paper.
   [unnamed-5.jpg]
   I wrote a number on each student's desk with dry erase marker (they
   love when I write on their desks), and had them come choose the
   materials to create their number.
   [unnamed-4.jpg]
   [unnamed-3.jpg]
    We even had a MISS Perry the Place Value Robot! On the bodies of the
   robots, they wrote their number in number form, word form, expanded
   form, and unit form.
   **Happy teacher moment: I had students asking to exchange hundreds for
   ten tens and tens for ten ones.  Praise the heavens above, I am getting
   through to them!
   [unnamed.jpg]
   [unnamed-1.jpg]
   [unnamed-2.jpg]
   Earlier in the week, we did some more hands on practice! We used my
   place value number cards, which is also from my Place Value Activity
   Pack.  My kids were pros at expanded form and identifying the values of
   digits after using these.  You can also see that each student has their
   very own Perry the Place Value Robot! I made mini anchor chart rings
   for each common core math standard.  The kiddos love using them.  You
   can find them in my TPT store by clicking here!
   [unnamed-1.jpg]
   My sweet littles also love using playing cards in math. They make
   everything into a game.  We played "Deal Me In" to practice writing
   numbers in different forms. The hundreds, tens, and ones houses are
   included in my Place Value Activity Pack.
   Click HERE for the FREE recording sheets!
   [unnamed.jpg]
   Our place value unit is coming to an end, but my kiddos are rocking it.
   Check out my Place Value Activity Pack to snatch these activities,
   along with lots more!

Communities and Run On Sentences

   We have wrapped up our third full week of school and we have been busy
   bees! I don't know about your schedules, but in second grade it can be
   tough to squeeze in things like science and social studies.  Because of
   our tight schedules, I try to pack as many science and social studies
   standards into my reading curriculum.  The past couple weeks, we have
   been studying types of communities.  We started off with a close read.
    I call it a "treasure read" and we act like pirates searching for
   important treasure in the text.  Sounds silly but I promise it gets the
   kiddos engaged!
   [IMG_1490.JPG]
   The favorite activity was TRASHKETBALL! You just need three different
   sized baskets (small, medium, and large).  I cut up strips of sentences
   from my Types of Communities Packet that described a community. Each
   student got a strip and took turns reading theirs aloud.  The class
   worked together to decide which community it described, and then the
   student crumpled the paper into a ball.  Then they shot their ball into
   the correct basket.  Small=Rural, Medium=Suburban, Large=Urban.
   [IMG_1496.JPG]
   [IMG_1495.JPG]
   [IMG_1494.JPG]
   [IMG_1497.JPG]
   Some of the strips of paper described more than one community, so they
   had to tear it into two or three pieces to place in the correct
   baskets.  This is where we covered our reading standard of comparing
   and contrasting in a text.  They LOVED it and definitely knew the
   difference between the communities by the end of the game.  The
   students finished by completing a compare and contrast graphic
   organizer from my Types of Communities Packet.
   Later in the week, we used our close read to complete the Communities
   Booklet.  Their covers turned out cute!  I love how some added
   chimneys.
   [IMG_1500.JPG]
   [IMG_1501.JPG]
   [IMG_1502.JPG]
   You can find all of these activities in my Types of Communities Packet.
   Click below to check it out!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2016-09-05%2Bat%2B8.41.59%2BPM.png]
   We have also been working hard on strengthening our sentences! My
   kiddos always struggle with writing run on sentences.  After
   introducing the concept, they worked with a partner to complete "The
   Longest Sentence Ever" activity.  I used one of our decodable readers
   to write sentences without punctuation or capitals on pieces of butcher
   paper.  The students then worked together to edit the run on sentences.

   [IMG_1504.JPG]
   [IMG_1505.JPG]
   Its been a fun past three weeks with these kiddos and I can't wait to
   see what the year holds for us!
