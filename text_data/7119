   Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and his French counterpart
   Emmanuel Macron agreed to combine joint efforts to preserve Libyan
   national institutions and reach a settlement to the conflict in the
   country.

   During a meeting between the two presidents on Monday on the sidelines
   of the G7 summit meetings held in the French coastal city of Biarritz,
   El-Sisi and Macron exchanged views on a number of regional issues and
   discussed enhancing bilateral partnership and consultations on issues
   of mutual interests.

   "The French president praised his Egyptian counterpart's participation
   in the G7 summit, as well as the cultural bonds and bilateral relations
   binding the people of Egypt and France," Egypt's presidential
   spokesperson said in a statement.

   The two leaders stressed the necessity of reaching a settlement in
   Libya in a way that eradicates terrorism and limits foreign
   interference in the country.

   El-Sisi and Macron also discussed efforts to revive the Middle East
   peace process and countering terrorism, extremism and illegal
   migration.

   "The French president expressed keenness on maintaining consultation
   with Egypt on enhancing strategic cooperation mechanisms on regional
   and international issues of mutual interest," the spokesperson said.

   The Egyptian president hailed the historical Egyptian-French relations.

   "The meeting discussed ways of enhancing economic relations and
   French-African relations , especially within Egypt's chairmanship to
   the African Union," the spokesperson added.

   President El-Sisi arrived in Biarritz on Saturday to participate in the
   G7 Summit upon an invitation from President Macron.

   The Egyptian president held a range of meetings to discuss bilateral
   relations as well as regional and international issues on the sidelines
   of the summit with a number of world leaders, including US President
   Donald Trump, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela
   Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti.

   The Egyptian president also met with a number of African leaders
   including the presidents of Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa and Burkina
   Faso and the head of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki.

   On Monday, the Egyptian president took part in a working session on
   climate, biological diversity and oceans.
