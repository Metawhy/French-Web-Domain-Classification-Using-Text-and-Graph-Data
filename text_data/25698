NEW ANIMATION! Earthquake!! Shaking up Central America

   Whereas transform-fault and shallow-crustal-intraplate earthquakes have
   dominated the recent history of deadly and destructive earthquakes in
   Central America, we should never underestimate the potential
   destructive power of subduction zone earthquakes.

NEW ANIMATION! - Faults, Plate Boundaries, & Stress

   Earth’s thin, brittle outer shell of rock is under a constant state of
   stress. This animation explores how this stress impacts the formation
   of small local faults, and broader tectonic plate boundaries.

SCIENCE AND PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS

   Bears vs. Seismic Stations

Bears vs. Seismic Stations

   Many animals encounter sites where seismic equipment has been installed
   but most animals leave these sites alone after a cursory glance or
   sniff. In contrast, bears appear to be enticed to visit station sites
   and investigate the seismic equipment, sometimes causing significant
   damage. What's a seismologist to do?
   Tracking Typhoons

Tracking Typhoons

   In the western Pacific Ocean, massive tropical cyclones (called
   typhoons) occur throughout the year. Retailleau and Gualtieri (2019)
   show that seismology can be used to track and measure tropical cyclones
   as they churn through the ocean because they create “secondary
   microseisms.”

‘Suture Zone’ to Blame for Mysterious 2014 Earthquake Felt Across Florida

   University of South Florida seismologists have uncovered the unexpected
   source of a magnitude 5.1 earthquake that occurred in 2014 along the
   northern coast of Cuba.
