About

   ed banger records

   14 years ago, back in March 2003 in Montmartre north of Paris,
   Pedro «  Busy P » Winter created Ed Banger records.
   The rise of the label has been something of a phenomenon, with its
   artists touring worldwide with DJ and live performances at sold out
   venues, each appearance always long awaited and celebrated like the
   coming of the messiah by thousands of kids from each and every part of
   the world.

   TheÂ labelâsÂ second release, JusticeâsÂ Â«Â We are your friendÂ Â»
   became a generation anthem.Â Drawing on the street energy of hip hop,
   rockâs explosion and the hypnotic compression of house music, but
   remaining open to all other infuences, the sound of the label, mostly
   electronic and saturated, has become a trademark, registered worldwide.

   The revered roster (Justice, DJ Mehdi, SebastiAn, BreakBot, Mr. Oizo,
   Boston Bun…) and SO MEâs post-cartoon imaging are practically pop
   culture icons, especially within the world of new media (blogs, forums,
   social networks) where Ed Banger remains at the top of their game. MTV
   and Grammy awards winner, Ed Banger is one of the most
   respectedÂ French record label in the world.
