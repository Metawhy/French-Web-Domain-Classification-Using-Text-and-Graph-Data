   anyone in the email chain.

     * Scott Werlein SigParer testimonial headshot
       SigParser was totally effortless! They found hundreds of contacts
       from my emails, which I was able to actively reach out to with
       their simple user interface.

       collection of emails from across the world into an organized
       contact list. It's proved an invaluable tool for our team as we

       out and arrange new sessions with ease.

   [[plan.name]]
   $[[plan.price]].00
   Estimated Results [[(plan.emails) | round | formatNumber]] emails
   [[plan.emails/13.58 | round | formatNumber ]] new contacts
   [[(plan.emails/32.59) | round | formatNumber]] new phone numbers
   [[(plan.emails/56.24) | round | formatNumber]] new titles

   Charged per email account. Typically takes 1.5 days to process every
   100,000 emails. Estimates based on business email accounts which are
   generally in sales or some outward facing role. A personal email
   account will generally have less contacts found per email and less
   total emails.

PST Files

   PST files are charged by the number of emails. You could have 1 file
   with 500,000 emails or 10 files with 50,000 emails each and you'd pay
   the same price. You can upload your files to us and get an estimate for
   each file before purchasing.
