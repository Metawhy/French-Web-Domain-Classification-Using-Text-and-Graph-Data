You Might – Or Might Not – Find This Three Minute Video Useful Of Me Talking
About Student Motivation

   Posted by Larry Ferlazzo | Sep 23, 2019 | SEL Update, video | 0 |

   suju / Pixabay


   Awhile back, a Swedish TV show on education interviewed me via Skype
   about student motivation.

   The show just came out, and they included what I think is a relatively
   decent three minute clip of me talking about student motivation and
   growth mindset.

   I’ve linked directly to that short clip here (they don’t allow
   embedding).

   You might, or might not, find it useful.

   I’m adding it to a list of other interviews I’ve done.

Build a 3D Movie On The Web

   Posted by Larry Ferlazzo | Oct 16, 2008 | web 2.0 | 1 |

   Xtranormal is a new site that lets users create their own 3D movie
   clip. It has a text-to-speech feature that allows a computer generated
   voice to speak the script.

   School is out, but I’m still in my classroom and our district doesn’t
   have Internet Explorer 7, which is required by the site. So I haven’t
   been able to really try it out, but it looks easy enough for English
   Language Learners to use.

   My only concern is that users can easily watch movies made by others on
   the site, and it’s unclear to me how well they will be monitored for
   inappropropriate content.

   I’ll explore it further, and would be interested in hearing from other
   people who try it out.

   Thanks to TechCrunch for the tip.

       I don’t think you need IE, was working fine in Firefox 3 for me.
       But I’m on a mac, perhaps it’s different from Windows?

“Wave” Is Yet Another Smartphone App For Providing Audio Photo Captions

   Posted by Larry Ferlazzo | Mar 12, 2013 | talking, web 2.0 | 0 |

   Wave joins the list of several free Smartphone apps that let you record
   an audio caption for a photo.

   I’m adding it to The Best Sites To Practice Speaking English and to The
   Best Online Tools For Using Photos In Lessons.

YouTube Announces Super-Easy “Create” Feature

   Posted by Larry Ferlazzo | Mar 23, 2011 | music and art, video, web 2.0
   | 1 |

   I certainly wouldn’t place any bets on YouTube getting through most
   school district content filters anytime soon, if ever. But they’ve just
   announced a great new ability to make videos and animations on the
   YouTube site itself using GoAnimate, Stupeflix, or Xtranormal and then
   posting it there.

   The YouTube feature is called YouTube/create.

   I can see myself using it sometimes to illustrate a concept for a
   lesson, or pointing out the idiocy of the latest school reform fad. But
   I suspect that it’s a super-cool tool that, outside of the two ideas I
   mentioned and potential use in adult ESL classes, won’t have much K-12
   impact.

   But, because it’s so cool, I’m still adding it to The Best Ways For
   Students To Create Online Animations (for adult students) and to The
   Best Ways For Students To Create Online Videos (Using Someone Else’s
   Content).

   Thanks to TechCrunch for the tip.

       I am a student at the University of South Alabama in Dr. Strange’s
       EDM 310 class. I have uploaded a couple of videos to YouTube I
       think I could use this to make one with more items put together.
       Using it in certain classes is a great way to teach students
       anything you want them to pick up for the older ones they will have
       fun trying this in school. You can find me on twitter @barsch41 or
       my class blog at barschdustinedm310.blogspot.com
