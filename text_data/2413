   Title: Artificial Palm Trees vs Real Palm Trees
   Poll by: gardengirl

   Real Palm Tree vs. Artificial Palm Trees Featured Article
   With real palm trees, now being offered in our online store, there is
   no reason why you can not own a real palm tree instead of an artificial
   palm tree. Many artificial palm tree suppliers would lead you to
   believe that real palm trees are high maintenance, when in fact
   approximately 90% of all real palm trees, are low maintenance. And most
   real palm trees can live indoors, which is another common
   misconception. Real palm trees, are also more aesthetically pleasing to
   the eye, being that they are the real thing. Whereas, artificial palm
   trees most of the time don't resemble real life features which are
   typically found in real palm trees. A primary example of these features
   are flowers and fruits. At Reals Nursery, we wish for every person in
   the world to have a piece of unspoiled nature in their home, whether
   they purchase from us or from any other reputable nursery. We want the
   world to be greener, and by supplying trees, whether real palm trees or
   real plants in general we feel we are making a difference in the world.
