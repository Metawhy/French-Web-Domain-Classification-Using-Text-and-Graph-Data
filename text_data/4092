 June 27, 2019

   Update: this position is now filled. Get in touch if you want to apply
   for a scholarship/fellowship with me.

PhD position available: (epi)genomics of protists

Practical information

   Location: Paris-Sud University (Orsay, France)
   Type of position : PhD position (full time)
   Contract length : 3 years (possibility of a one year extension)
   Starting date : Oct 1st, 2019 (negotiable)
   Annual gross salary: € 25,620
   Application deadline : July 17, 2019

Project overview

   The candidate will work in the context of the ERC Starting Grant
   Macro-EpiK, which aims, among others, at better understanding the
   diversity and evolution of epigenetic modifications in eukaryotic
   microbes (protists).

   During his/her PhD, the candidate will take part in 1) preparing
   genetic material (RNA and DNA) for transcriptome, genome and methylome
   sequencing, and 2) their subsequent assembly, annotation and various
   other bioinformatic investigations.

   More specifically, they will be in charge of the following tasks:
   – preparation and maintenance of protist cultures, with an emphasis on
   under-studied lineages;
   – RNA/DNA extraction for various NGS sequencing techniques (Illumina,
   Nanopore, Hi-C, bisulfite…), from cultures or, in the case of organisms
   difficult to grow at high density, directly from single-cells;
   – sequence assembly and annotation in order to obtain high-quality
   genome data;
   – bioinformatic investigation of the epigenome;
   – phylogenetic reconstruction of specific genes of interest.

Your profile

   We will prioritize candidates with an excellent background in
   bioinformatics (transcriptome and/or genome analyses including
   assembly, data cleaning, annotation, and molecular phylogenetics).
   Alternatively, we will consider candidates with microbiology background
   (culture maintenance, genetic material preparation for sequencing),
   under the condition that they show a real enthusiasm to acquire an
   expertise in bioinformatics. This is an ambitious project which will
   require commitment and thoroughness.

   Additional requirements
   – English proficiency (written and spoken).
   – Good presentation and communication skills
   – Autonomy and organization
   – Synthetic mind and critical thinking

Working environment

   The Ecology, Systematics and Evolution (ESE) unit is coaffiliated CNRS
   – Paris-Sud University – AgroParisTech, and is located on the Paris-Sud
   campus, in Orsay. Orsay is 20 kms South of Paris and directly
   accessible by the RER (commuter rail).

   The candidate will be a member of the DEEM team (Diversity, Ecology et
   Evolution of Microbes: http://www.deemteam.fr/en), which focuses on
   microorganismal diversity and evolution, using molecular phylogenetics
   and comparative genomics. The candidate will work closely with other
   members involved in the Macro-EpiK project and will be supervised by
   Laura Eme (laura.eme@u-psud.fr).

   Our team is international and the working language is English. We work
   in a good atmosphere and an inclusive and supportive environment. We
   welcome candidates from all horizons!

Applications

   !! Please apply using the following link : http://bit.ly/2KGrcDU!!

   We will not be able to consider direct applications by email. Feel free
   to contact me (laura.eme@u-psud.fr) for any additional
   information. Applications should include a detailed CV, a cover letter
   and contact information for at least two referees.

   The ceremony for the medical research prizes of the Fondation de France
   took place last night. I am particularly thankful to the Fondation
   Jacques Monod for its engagement toward basic research and for its
   decision to award its prize for the first time to the field of
   evolutionary biology.

   All laureates and a summary of the evening is available here (in

   Using culture-independent transcriptomics and phylogenomics, our latest
   work published in Nature shows that the understudied and beautiful
   hemimastigophoreans do not belong to any known supergroup of
   eukaryotes.

   Thijs Ettema and myself have co-authored a News and Views highlighting
   the publication by Akil and Robinson in the last issue of Nature. In
   this work, the authors performed in vitro experiment on several Asgard
   profilins and showed that they were able to regulate the polymerization
   of eukaryotic actin filaments. This suggests that Asgard archaea also
   have a (perhaps primitive) dynamic profilin-regulated actin
   cytoskeleton.

   Apply to the most prestigious workshop in Molecular Evolution at the
   MBL in Woods Hole, July 19 – July 28! I will be part of the faculty
   crew this year to talk about multi-gene phylogenetics for deep
   divergence.

   http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/workshop-on-molecular-evolution/

     MBL’s Workshop on Molecular Evolution is the most prestigious
     workshop serving the field of evolutionary studies. Founded in 1988,
     it is the longest-running workshop if its kind, and it has earned
     worldwide recognition for its rich and intensive learning
     experience. Students work closely with internationally-recognized
     scientists, receiving (i) high-level instruction in the principles
     of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics, (ii) advanced
     training in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets, and
     (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software tools (often from
     the authors of the programs they are using). The material is
     delivered via lectures, discussions, and bioinformatic exercises
     motivated by contemporary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark
     of this workshop is the direct interaction between students and
     field-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate students,
     postdocs, and established faculty from around the world seeking to
     apply the principles of molecular evolution to questions of
     anthropology, conservation genetics, development, behavior,
     physiology, and ecology. The workshop also welcomes participants
     from federal agencies and science journalists. A priority of this
     workshop is to foster an environment where students can learn from
     each other as well from the course faculty.

   Faculty members include:

   Cécile Ané, University of Wisconsin-Madison
   Peter Beerli, Florida State University
   Joseph Bielawski, Dalhousie University
   Belinda Chang, University of Toronto
   Casey Dunn, Yale University
   Scott Edwards, Harvard University

   Submit and take part in our symposium at the II Joint Congress on
   Evolutionary Biology.

   – New approaches to phylogenomics –

   Organizers: Laura Eme, Carolin Kosiol, Vincent Daubin, Nicola De Maio

   Genomes maintain a chronicle of their own history, from short scale
   evolution (e.g. cancer and within-host viral evolution) to the last
   common ancestor of all extant life. For some organisms, such as most
   microbial lineages, it is practically the sole source of evolutionary
   information available. For others, the interdependence between genome
   evolutionary patterns and life history traits (phenotype, ecology,
   epigenetic…) documented using other techniques remains largely obscure.
   Recent methodological developments in comparative genomics allow for
   gene tree / species tree reconciliation and the identification of
   horizontal gene transfer, for estimating the age, polymorphism and gene
   repertoire of ancestral populations, for tracing back the history of
   migrations, population splits and admixtures, and for reconstructing
   mutational and selective pressures. Understanding the link of these
   patterns to life history traits, population dynamics and evolutionary
   success remains a major question and methodological challenge. This
   symposium is dedicated to new methodological developments in
   integrating genomic data with other sources of information, from
   fossils, to phenotypic, epidemiological, epigenetic and geographical
   data.

   Invited speaker: Andrew J. Roger “Realism in phylogenetic models is
   essential for reconstructing early eukaryote evolution”.

   Note the possibility to apply for financial aid for female attendees!

   Blastocystis is the most prevalent eukaryotic microbe colonizing the
   human gut, infecting approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. In
   this collaborative work, we have sequenced and analyzed the genome of
   Blastocystis subtype 1, and compared to previously published sequences
   for ST4 and ST7. Overall, this study provides an important window into
   the biology of Blastocystis, showcasing significant differences between
   STs that can guide future experimental investigations into differences
   in their virulence and clarifying the roles of these organisms in gut
   health and disease.
