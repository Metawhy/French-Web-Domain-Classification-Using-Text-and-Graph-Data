Where's Wilson?: Children's Book Review

   [Wheres%2BWilson%2Bcover%2Bwm%2B20160514_112839.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   Last year, I reviewed the lovely children's book "Man In The Moon" by
   author Kelly Young-Silverman, with beautiful watercolor illustrations
   by erin the great.  I am honored to share with you their latest
   collaboration, "Where's Wilson?".
   "Where's Wilson?" is a beautiful bedtime story about the search for one
   of the counting sheep that goes missing right before bedtime. All the
   animals on the farm search for Wilson, the fourth counting sheep. How
   will the children get to sleep if they don't have all the sheep to
   count? My Pre-K class loved the rhyming text and stunning
   illustrations!
   [wheres%2Bwilson%2Billustration%2Bpage%2Bwm%2B20160514_112908.jpg]
   "Where's Wilson?" has a special little surprise: a hidden frog on each
   page, just as "Man In The Moon" had a hidden ladybug. And, like "Man In
   The Moon", a portion of the proceeds from the book is donated to St.
   Jude's Children's Hospital.
   You can purchase a copy of "Where's Wilson?" (and "Man in the Moon") on
   the author's website: Evie and Knox Stories. You will also find some
   printables and coloring pages on the Evie and Knox site!
   Happy Reading!

Primary Peach Launch Party Freebie: Quick and Easy End of the Year Gift Ideas
For Support Staff

   Today is the day ---I can finally let the cat out of the bag!!!! I am
   thrilled to be a part of a BRAND NEW collaborative teaching blog,
   written exclusively by GEORGIA teacher bloggers!!! This new blog will
   be packed with tips, tricks, ideas and treats from some of the very
   best Georgia teachers! Now, without further adieu, I present:

                           [mandy-blogbutton.png]

   And the news gets even MORE exciting! Our very first post is a BLOG HOP
   filled with End of the School Year themed FREEBIES!!!! It's hard to
   believe the school year is almost over. We've got some great goodies to
   help make your year-end craziness go just little bit smoother----each
   contributor has created a special Freebie to sweeten our Launch Party!

   [Picture3.png]
   I'm Ayn Colsh, a contributing author on the Primary Peach, as the
   resident Ga. Pre-K teacher. I've been teaching 20+ years, mostly in
   Pre-K, and and a BIG proponent of play-based, hands-on learning, I've
   been involved with the Georgia Pre-K program for 9 years now, and I
   LOVE what I do! Where else can you go to work and dress up, play, have
   snack, get dirty and have fun every day? Teaching is the BEST
   profession!  I blog about my adventures as a Georgia Pre-K teacher here
   on my personal blog, little illuminations, and am also a monthly
   contributor on the collaborative blog, PreK+K Sharing. I am married
   with two beautiful daughters, Lyndsay, 24 and Bailey, 17. We share our
   home with two dogs, Max and Ella.
   [ayn%2Bcrop%2B33430_1328526498868_7728829_n.jpg]
   Be sure to check out the "ABOUT" page on Primary Peach to meet all of
   our contributors!
   [Picture4.png]
   Now, for the sweet treat I promised you. There are always the folks
   that helped my own children in school, and have been essential to my
   life as a teacher that are often forgotten when the "Thank You" gifts
   are handed out at the end of the year. The custodians, office staff,
   bus drivers, Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapists---all those
   folks who really have a hand in making our days go smoother are often
   overlooked. Most often, it is just not easy to purchase gifts for
   everyone we'd like to thank. A few years ago, my daughter started
   taking in doughnuts for the custodians near the end of the year because
   she said especially in high school, no one ever thinks to say "thank
   you" for all they do. I made these cute little gift tags that can be
   attached to a box of donuts for them this year. You don't have to spend
   a lot to let someone know that they are appreciated. A kind gesture
   goes a LONG way!
   [DONUT%2Bgift%2Btag%2Blittleilluminations.jpg]
   You can get my FREEBIE "I 'DONUT' know what I'd do without you!" gift
   tags here!

The Wide Mouthed Frog

   [title%2Bpic%2Bheader%2Bwide%2Bmouthed%2Bfrog.jpg]
   Spring is here!!! We are learning about a variety of life cycles in our
   Pre-K class and reading lots of great books about animals that come out
   in the Spring. One of the favorite units is our unit on Pond Life,
   which includes all the animals found around a pond, especially frogs!
   This week, we are reading two versions of the same story about the Wide
   Mouthed Frog. Although the stories vary a little, essentially the story
   is about a frog that goes around telling smaller creatures that he has
   a big wide mouth and will eat them. Eventually, he comes across
   something bigger than himself and discovers he is the desired meal time
   snack!
      ***This post contains affiliate links for your convenience. Little
   Illuminations is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates

   The Big Wide Mouthed Frog by Ana Martin Larranaga is a favorite in our
   class! The kids love to help tell the story by chiming in with the
   repetitive portions of the text!
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0744567076&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinIma

   leillum08-20]
   Wide Mouthed Frog by Keith Faulkner is one of my favorites, because it
   is set in the Okefenokee Swamp, which is located in Georgia and
   Florida, so it includes creatures my students are familiar with. The
   kids love it because it is a pop-up book, and what kid doesn't just
   love a pop-up book?

   We made our own wide mouthed frogs, using construction paper and paper
   plates.

Polar Bear Ice Cream Cups

     [Polar%2BBear%2BIce%2BCream%2Bcup%2Bheader%2Bpi.jpg]
   I saw the teachers making these fun little ice cream cups for the kids
   in the toddler room and I had to share them here with you! They took a
   plain vanilla ice cream cup, added banana slices for ears, chocolate
   chips (upside down) for eyes and I'm not sure about the nose but I
   think it is an upside down Hershey's Kiss. Too cute!!! We will
   definitely be making these with some of our Polar activities next year!
   Look for some other fun wintery snacks we've had lately to be posted
   here soon!

Man In The Moon: Children's Book Review

   [Man%2Bin%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Bcover%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC09708.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   I have recently had the opportunity to read a gorgeous new children's
   book by author Kelly Young-Silverman, titled "Man In The Moon". "Man in
   the Moon" is about a little girl who sees the moon and wonders what it
   must be like up there. She talks to the moon, and although he doesn't
   reply, he smiles down sweetly at her. Told in rhyming form, it is a
   very sweet story about friendship!
   [Man%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Breview%2Bwm%2BDSC09994.jpg]
   There is a special treat hidden on each page----a sweet little ladybug.
   The pictures are beautiful watercolor illustrations by the extremely
   talented Erin the Great.
   This is sure to become a favorite and is perfect for a bedtime story. I
   read it to my Pre-K class and they absolutely loved it and have asked
   to hear it again!
   You can purchase a copy of "Man in the Moon" on the author's website :
   Evie and Knox Stories. Bonus: 5% of the book's proceeds go to help St.
   Jude's Children's Hospitals.

My Doctor and Me ABC: Children's Book Review

   ** I received a digital copy of this book to preview as a gift. After
   reading and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions
   expressed in this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in
   any way. Also included in this post are my Amazon Affiliate links to
   the book.**
   If you are a regular follower of little illuminations, you know that
   one of my passions is children's literature. I love collecting it,
   reading it and especially sharing it! I try to provide my students with
   a wide variety of reading material on our bookshelf relating to the
   topic we are currently discussing. Just before beginning our study on
   community helpers, the stars aligned and I received a message asking if
   I would like to preview an e-copy of a new book for children about
   going to the doctor called "My Doctor and Me ABC" written by Dr.
   Stephanie Cox, M.D. and illustrated by Emily Burger. Score!!!

                   [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BCover%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   "My Doctor and Me ABC" is an adorably fun book that presents a healthy
   habit, body part, instrument or  medical exam component using a medical
   vocabulary word that goes with each letter of the alphabet, along with
   a little rhyme. It is like taking a mini field trip to the doctor's
   office!

                 [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BX%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   The illustrations are adorable and illustrate each concept well.

              [My%2Bdoctor%2Band%2Bme%2Bletter%2BI%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   Dr. Stephanie Cox is a Family Physician in Iowa and enjoys caring for
   the children in her practice. She wrote the book in an effort to ease
   fears for children experiencing a doctor's visit.
   "My Doctor and Me ABC" has already received some notable attention. It
   has just won an Honorable Mention from the 2014 Readers' Choice 2014
   International Book Awards. I'm sure it will be on some of the other
   book award lists soon!
   I love the rhyming text and the use of common medical jargon. I think
   it is never too early to start helping children learn correct
   terminology--and this book does this beautifully without going over
   their heads!

             [My%2BDoctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BF%2Bwm%2B.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   I read the book to my class and they LOVED it! I would definitely
   recommend getting this book for children before visiting the doctor's
   office or for teachers to use when learning about health and wellness
   or doctors/community helpers.
   If you would like to purchase the book, you may click on my Amazon

   health. Stop by and give her page a "like" and be sure to let her know

Going To The Doctor: Our Community Helpers

   [Going%2BTo%2BThe%2BDoctor%2Btitle%2Bheader%2BPicMonkey%2BCollage.jpg]
   ****Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links.****
   Going to the doctor can be scary for kids. When we talk about community
   helpers, I always include discussions and books about people in the
   medical profession. We talk about why it is important to have regular
   check-ups, going for sick visits and even immunizations. No one likes
   getting a shot, and preschoolers are often even more apprehensive since
   they are precisely at an age where many of the booster immunizations
   are administered. I think helping children know what to anticipate
   during a visit can be reassuring and helps to alleviate some of the
   fear. Whenever possible, I try to have parents (doctors, nurses,
   pharmacists, etc.) come in and share what they do.
   One of our parents (a doctor) came to visit and shared a sweet book
   called "What's In A Doctor's Bag?" by Neil Shulman and Sibley Fleming.
   She then pulled out items from her doctor's bag and demonstrated each
   item. Later, she let the kids explore and experiment with the items.
   The children listened to their heartbeats and had their reflexes
   tested.

   [going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bshot%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC07742.jpg]
   In our small groups later in the week, children made a little doctor
   kit, placing some of the first aid supplies inside while discussing
   what each item was used for.
   [Going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bmaking%2Bdoctor%2Bkits%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC07

   [Going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bdoctors%2Bkit%2Boutside%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BD
   SC07822.jpg]
   We had a pharmacist (another parent) come to speak to our class. She
   talked about medicines, first aid and spreading germs. We did a great
   little experiment on spreading germs. She added some fine glitter to a
   bottle of hand sanitizer to simulate germs and gave two children a
   little squirt to rub on their hands. Each child shook hands with
   another student and that student continued to pass on the handshake.
   After everyone had finished, we looked at our hands. Even though only
   two people had the hand sanitizer germs, almost everyone had a little
   glitter on their hands! This really helped illustrate the concept of
   spreading germs in a concrete way.

   After talking about simple wound care (such as bug bites, cuts and
   scrapes), she gave use a little first aid kit for our class. We already
   have a pretty extensive first aid kit both in our classroom and in our
   school office, but this one is perfect to use on the fly for field
   trips.

   One of our neighboring classes did a cute craft about x rays. The
   students traced around their arms with chalk on black paper and glued
   cotton swabs to represent bones on the x ray. Too cute!!!!
   [going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bx%2Bray%2Bcrop%2Bwm%2BDSC07802.jpg]
   I am so fortunate to have such great parents that are willing to come
   in to share their occupations with the class! I think many of the
   children's fears were eased by getting to know our community helpers
   and asking questions. Thank you, Dr. Syed, and Mrs. Williams for
   sharing your time and expertise with us!

14 "Must-See" Sunday School Bulletin Boards, Doors and More!

   [Holy%2BComforter%2BBulletin%2BBoards%2Bcollage%2Btitle%2Bwm.jpg]
   While the norm here on little illuminations is posting about our
   adventures in Pre-K, I have recently started teaching Sunday School.
   We've had a small team of angels (especially Kristy and Lori) that
   worked tirelessly to make our Sunday School rooms bright, energetic and
   inviting. The decor is just SO fabulous, that I had to share them here
   with you!
   Our Sunday School program is centered around stations that the children
   (ages K-5) rotate through on various weeks. Stations include art,
   drama/storytelling, science, games and cooking. We also have  nursery,
   preschool and middle school rooms.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Brainbow%2Btrail%2Bwm%2BDSC07486%2Bcrop.jpg]

   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Byoufit%2Bpuzzle%2Bwm%2BDSC07477%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I just love this rainbow and cloud! It makes the room such a cozy place
   for children to curl up with a book!

   This cross is just beautiful! Made by placing tape in the shape of a
   cross and painting stripes of color over it. When dry, remove the tape.
   I want to make one of these to hang in my home!

   I love this Noah's Ark wall mural! Even the youngest members of our
   church are blessed with gorgeous surroundings!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bnoahs%2Bark%2Bwm%2BDSC07488%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The theme in our art/cooking/science is "God is the Master
   Artist…Master Chef…Master Scientist…Master of All Creations".
   Don't you just love this giant paint brush and palette in our art area?
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bpaint%2Bwm%2BDSC07475%2Bcrop.jpg]
   These decorations in our cooking area are just too sweet!!!

   In our drama room, this is a great way to "spotlight" our learning
   focus each week.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bspotlight%2Bwm%2BDSC07489%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love the Imagination Station! It just pops with color and creativity!
   The theme is "Gears...Setting our minds on God."

   The pièce de résistance is this FABULOUS 3-D Albert Einstein bulletin
   board!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Beinstein%2Bwm%2BDSC07473%2Bcrop.jpg]
   We are SO blessed to have such creative folks leading the way for our
   Christian Education program! They have done such a wonderful job to
   make this an exciting and inviting space for our younger members of the
   church family.

Where's Wilson?: Children's Book Review

   [Wheres%2BWilson%2Bcover%2Bwm%2B20160514_112839.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   Last year, I reviewed the lovely children's book "Man In The Moon" by
   author Kelly Young-Silverman, with beautiful watercolor illustrations
   by erin the great.  I am honored to share with you their latest
   collaboration, "Where's Wilson?".
   "Where's Wilson?" is a beautiful bedtime story about the search for one
   of the counting sheep that goes missing right before bedtime. All the
   animals on the farm search for Wilson, the fourth counting sheep. How
   will the children get to sleep if they don't have all the sheep to
   count? My Pre-K class loved the rhyming text and stunning
   illustrations!
   [wheres%2Bwilson%2Billustration%2Bpage%2Bwm%2B20160514_112908.jpg]
   "Where's Wilson?" has a special little surprise: a hidden frog on each
   page, just as "Man In The Moon" had a hidden ladybug. And, like "Man In
   The Moon", a portion of the proceeds from the book is donated to St.
   Jude's Children's Hospital.
   You can purchase a copy of "Where's Wilson?" (and "Man in the Moon") on
   the author's website: Evie and Knox Stories. You will also find some
   printables and coloring pages on the Evie and Knox site!
   Happy Reading!

Primary Peach Launch Party Freebie: Quick and Easy End of the Year Gift Ideas
For Support Staff

   Today is the day ---I can finally let the cat out of the bag!!!! I am
   thrilled to be a part of a BRAND NEW collaborative teaching blog,
   written exclusively by GEORGIA teacher bloggers!!! This new blog will
   be packed with tips, tricks, ideas and treats from some of the very
   best Georgia teachers! Now, without further adieu, I present:

   [UlfmxLbk_xef4yJ3pLFTPKo_9HVNeXsPmFZlymdTHBn6jODTzD_xNlconkka5rHUqZqmZ9
                 gG2J59luhyJzVIwwbE4dwSoIWffA5uy-dz208=s0-d]

   And the news gets even MORE exciting! Our very first post is a BLOG HOP
   filled with End of the School Year themed FREEBIES!!!! It's hard to
   believe the school year is almost over. We've got some great goodies to
   help make your year-end craziness go just little bit smoother----each
   contributor has created a special Freebie to sweeten our Launch Party!

   [Picture3.png]
   I'm Ayn Colsh, a contributing author on the Primary Peach, as the
   resident Ga. Pre-K teacher. I've been teaching 20+ years, mostly in
   Pre-K, and and a BIG proponent of play-based, hands-on learning, I've
   been involved with the Georgia Pre-K program for 9 years now, and I
   LOVE what I do! Where else can you go to work and dress up, play, have
   snack, get dirty and have fun every day? Teaching is the BEST
   profession!  I blog about my adventures as a Georgia Pre-K teacher here
   on my personal blog, little illuminations, and am also a monthly
   contributor on the collaborative blog, PreK+K Sharing. I am married
   with two beautiful daughters, Lyndsay, 24 and Bailey, 17. We share our
   home with two dogs, Max and Ella.
   [ayn%2Bcrop%2B33430_1328526498868_7728829_n.jpg]
   Be sure to check out the "ABOUT" page on Primary Peach to meet all of
   our contributors!
   [Picture4.png]
   Now, for the sweet treat I promised you. There are always the folks
   that helped my own children in school, and have been essential to my
   life as a teacher that are often forgotten when the "Thank You" gifts
   are handed out at the end of the year. The custodians, office staff,
   bus drivers, Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapists---all those
   folks who really have a hand in making our days go smoother are often
   overlooked. Most often, it is just not easy to purchase gifts for
   everyone we'd like to thank. A few years ago, my daughter started
   taking in doughnuts for the custodians near the end of the year because
   she said especially in high school, no one ever thinks to say "thank
   you" for all they do. I made these cute little gift tags that can be
   attached to a box of donuts for them this year. You don't have to spend
   a lot to let someone know that they are appreciated. A kind gesture
   goes a LONG way!
   [DONUT%2Bgift%2Btag%2Blittleilluminations.jpg]
   You can get my FREEBIE "I 'DONUT' know what I'd do without you!" gift
   tags here!
   [original-1828993-1.jpg]
   Now, for EVEN MORE to sweeten the deal, how would you like to win a TPT
   gift certificate? We are having a Rafflecopter Giveaway too!!!! One
   lucky person will win a $50 TPT certificate and 3 more lucky folks will
   each win a $25 TPT gift certificate!!! You've got to be in it to win
   it!

The Wide Mouthed Frog

   [title%2Bpic%2Bheader%2Bwide%2Bmouthed%2Bfrog.jpg]
   Spring is here!!! We are learning about a variety of life cycles in our
   Pre-K class and reading lots of great books about animals that come out
   in the Spring. One of the favorite units is our unit on Pond Life,
   which includes all the animals found around a pond, especially frogs!
   This week, we are reading two versions of the same story about the Wide
   Mouthed Frog. Although the stories vary a little, essentially the story
   is about a frog that goes around telling smaller creatures that he has
   a big wide mouth and will eat them. Eventually, he comes across
   something bigger than himself and discovers he is the desired meal time
   snack!
      ***This post contains affiliate links for your convenience. Little

   The Big Wide Mouthed Frog by Ana Martin Larranaga is a favorite in our
   class! The kids love to help tell the story by chiming in with the
   repetitive portions of the text!

   Wide Mouthed Frog by Keith Faulkner is one of my favorites, because it
   is set in the Okefenokee Swamp, which is located in Georgia and
   Florida, so it includes creatures my students are familiar with. The
   kids love it because it is a pop-up book, and what kid doesn't just
   love a pop-up book?

Polar Bear Ice Cream Cups

     [Polar%2BBear%2BIce%2BCream%2Bcup%2Bheader%2Bpi.jpg]
   I saw the teachers making these fun little ice cream cups for the kids
   in the toddler room and I had to share them here with you! They took a
   plain vanilla ice cream cup, added banana slices for ears, chocolate
   chips (upside down) for eyes and I'm not sure about the nose but I
   think it is an upside down Hershey's Kiss. Too cute!!! We will
   definitely be making these with some of our Polar activities next year!
   Look for some other fun wintery snacks we've had lately to be posted
   here soon!

Man In The Moon: Children's Book Review

   [Man%2Bin%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Bcover%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC09708.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   I have recently had the opportunity to read a gorgeous new children's
   book by author Kelly Young-Silverman, titled "Man In The Moon". "Man in
   the Moon" is about a little girl who sees the moon and wonders what it
   must be like up there. She talks to the moon, and although he doesn't
   reply, he smiles down sweetly at her. Told in rhyming form, it is a
   very sweet story about friendship!
   [Man%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Breview%2Bwm%2BDSC09994.jpg]
   There is a special treat hidden on each page----a sweet little ladybug.
   The pictures are beautiful watercolor illustrations by the extremely
   talented Erin the Great.
   This is sure to become a favorite and is perfect for a bedtime story. I
   read it to my Pre-K class and they absolutely loved it and have asked
   to hear it again!
   You can purchase a copy of "Man in the Moon" on the author's website :
   Evie and Knox Stories. Bonus: 5% of the book's proceeds go to help St.
   Jude's Children's Hospitals.

My Doctor and Me ABC: Children's Book Review

   ** I received a digital copy of this book to preview as a gift. After
   reading and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions
   expressed in this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in
   any way. Also included in this post are my Amazon Affiliate links to
   the book.**
   If you are a regular follower of little illuminations, you know that
   one of my passions is children's literature. I love collecting it,
   reading it and especially sharing it! I try to provide my students with
   a wide variety of reading material on our bookshelf relating to the
   topic we are currently discussing. Just before beginning our study on
   community helpers, the stars aligned and I received a message asking if
   I would like to preview an e-copy of a new book for children about
   going to the doctor called "My Doctor and Me ABC" written by Dr.
   Stephanie Cox, M.D. and illustrated by Emily Burger. Score!!!

                   [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BCover%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   "My Doctor and Me ABC" is an adorably fun book that presents a healthy
   habit, body part, instrument or  medical exam component using a medical
   vocabulary word that goes with each letter of the alphabet, along with
   a little rhyme. It is like taking a mini field trip to the doctor's
   office!

                 [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BX%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   The illustrations are adorable and illustrate each concept well.

              [My%2Bdoctor%2Band%2Bme%2Bletter%2BI%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   Dr. Stephanie Cox is a Family Physician in Iowa and enjoys caring for
   the children in her practice. She wrote the book in an effort to ease
   fears for children experiencing a doctor's visit.
   "My Doctor and Me ABC" has already received some notable attention. It
   has just won an Honorable Mention from the 2014 Readers' Choice 2014
   International Book Awards. I'm sure it will be on some of the other
   book award lists soon!
   I love the rhyming text and the use of common medical jargon. I think
   it is never too early to start helping children learn correct
   terminology--and this book does this beautifully without going over
   their heads!

             [My%2BDoctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BF%2Bwm%2B.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   I read the book to my class and they LOVED it! I would definitely
   recommend getting this book for children before visiting the doctor's
   office or for teachers to use when learning about health and wellness
   or doctors/community helpers.
   If you would like to purchase the book, you may click on my Amazon

   Dr. Cox also has a facebook page for the book: "My Doctor and Me ABC"
   on which she shares about the book and posts and articles about kids'
   health. Stop by and give her page a "like" and be sure to let her know

Going To The Doctor: Our Community Helpers

   [Going%2BTo%2BThe%2BDoctor%2Btitle%2Bheader%2BPicMonkey%2BCollage.jpg]
   ****Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links.****
   Going to the doctor can be scary for kids. When we talk about community
   helpers, I always include discussions and books about people in the
   medical profession. We talk about why it is important to have regular
   check-ups, going for sick visits and even immunizations. No one likes
   getting a shot, and preschoolers are often even more apprehensive since
   they are precisely at an age where many of the booster immunizations
   are administered. I think helping children know what to anticipate
   during a visit can be reassuring and helps to alleviate some of the
   fear. Whenever possible, I try to have parents (doctors, nurses,
   pharmacists, etc.) come in and share what they do.
   One of our parents (a doctor) came to visit and shared a sweet book
   called "What's In A Doctor's Bag?" by Neil Shulman and Sibley Fleming.
   She then pulled out items from her doctor's bag and demonstrated each
   item. Later, she let the kids explore and experiment with the items.
   The children listened to their heartbeats and had their reflexes
   tested.

   In our small groups later in the week, children made a little doctor
   kit, placing some of the first aid supplies inside while discussing
   what each item was used for.

   We had a pharmacist (another parent) come to speak to our class. She
   talked about medicines, first aid and spreading germs. We did a great
   little experiment on spreading germs. She added some fine glitter to a
   bottle of hand sanitizer to simulate germs and gave two children a
   little squirt to rub on their hands. Each child shook hands with
   another student and that student continued to pass on the handshake.
   After everyone had finished, we looked at our hands. Even though only
   two people had the hand sanitizer germs, almost everyone had a little
   glitter on their hands! This really helped illustrate the concept of
   spreading germs in a concrete way.

   After talking about simple wound care (such as bug bites, cuts and
   scrapes), she gave use a little first aid kit for our class. We already
   have a pretty extensive first aid kit both in our classroom and in our
   school office, but this one is perfect to use on the fly for field
   trips.

   One of our neighboring classes did a cute craft about x rays. The
   students traced around their arms with chalk on black paper and glued
   cotton swabs to represent bones on the x ray. Too cute!!!!

   I am so fortunate to have such great parents that are willing to come
   in to share their occupations with the class! I think many of the
   children's fears were eased by getting to know our community helpers
   and asking questions. Thank you, Dr. Syed, and Mrs. Williams for
   sharing your time and expertise with us!

14 "Must-See" Sunday School Bulletin Boards, Doors and More!

   [Holy%2BComforter%2BBulletin%2BBoards%2Bcollage%2Btitle%2Bwm.jpg]
   While the norm here on little illuminations is posting about our
   adventures in Pre-K, I have recently started teaching Sunday School.
   We've had a small team of angels (especially Kristy and Lori) that
   worked tirelessly to make our Sunday School rooms bright, energetic and
   inviting. The decor is just SO fabulous, that I had to share them here
   with you!
   Our Sunday School program is centered around stations that the children
   (ages K-5) rotate through on various weeks. Stations include art,
   drama/storytelling, science, games and cooking. We also have  nursery,
   preschool and middle school rooms.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Brainbow%2Btrail%2Bwm%2BDSC07486%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bdor%2Bwm%2BDSC07474%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Biam%2Brainbow%2Bwm%2BDSC07484%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Byoufit%2Bpuzzle%2Bwm%2BDSC07477%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I just love this rainbow and cloud! It makes the room such a cozy place
   for children to curl up with a book!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07485%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07487%2Bcrop.jpg]
   This cross is just beautiful! Made by placing tape in the shape of a
   cross and painting stripes of color over it. When dry, remove the tape.
   I want to make one of these to hang in my home!

   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Bcloseup%2Bwm%2BDSC07482%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love this Noah's Ark wall mural! Even the youngest members of our
   church are blessed with gorgeous surroundings!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bnoahs%2Bark%2Bwm%2BDSC07488%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The theme in our art/cooking/science is "God is the Master
   Artist…Master Chef…Master Scientist…Master of All Creations".
   Don't you just love this giant paint brush and palette in our art area?
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bpaint%2Bwm%2BDSC07475%2Bcrop.jpg]
   These decorations in our cooking area are just too sweet!!!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bsweets%2Bwm%2BDSC07476%2Bcrop.jpg]
   In our drama room, this is a great way to "spotlight" our learning
   focus each week.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bspotlight%2Bwm%2BDSC07489%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love the Imagination Station! It just pops with color and creativity!
   The theme is "Gears...Setting our minds on God."
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bapps%2Bwm%2BDSC07483%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bgear%2Bup%2Bwm%2BDSC07479%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Blove%2Bthe%2BLord%2Bgears%2Bwm%2BDSC07480%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The pièce de résistance is this FABULOUS 3-D Albert Einstein bulletin
   board!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Beinstein%2Bwm%2BDSC07473%2Bcrop.jpg]
   We are SO blessed to have such creative folks leading the way for our
   Christian Education program! They have done such a wonderful job to
   make this an exciting and inviting space for our younger members of the
   church family.
   I love to hear your thoughts---share them in the comment section

About Me

   [Seuss%2Bcharacter%2Bday%2Blily%2Breese%2Band%2BMrs%2BAyn%2BDSC05074.jp
   g]
   I have been teaching early childhood for 20+ years in both private and
   public school programs and am a big proponent of implementing Best
   Practices through play-based learning experiences. I currently teach 4
   year olds in the Lottery Funded Georgia Pre-K program in a nationally
   accredited child care center.  I served on the committee to write the
   Georgia Early Learning Development Standards (GELDS), which are aligned
   from birth through age 5, and is the framework for my teaching. I am
   also the inclusion teacher for our school  and work with children with
   a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   I am a proud member of NAEYC (National Association for the Education of
   Young Children), GAYC (Georgia Association on Young Children) and SECA
   (Southern Early Childhood Association).
   You can find me here, on little Illuminations and on the group blog,
   PreK+K Sharing blog, which is a wonderful collaboration of authors,
   bloggers, performers, teachers, therapists, administrators and
   specialist on brain development and mental health, each sharing their
   unique perspective. I am an administrator/moderator on several online
   social media groups for teachers, as well.
   I love what I do---it's the best job in the world!!! Where else can you
   go to work each day and do art, play games, have snack and get hugs
   regularly AND get paid for it?! I love to share ideas with other
   teachers and see what they are doing in their classrooms. Teaching is
   the best profession---we love to share!

       Ayn,
       I am a big fan of your blog and I have started a new project called
       Aristoddlers. The goal of the project is to help kids learn some
       Ancient Greek and Roman lessons through entertaining stories. I
       have written my first book Aristoddlers and The Greedy King. If you
       or any of your followers would like me to send you a proof of the
       book I would be happy to and here is the link on Kickstarter:
       http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490457402/aristoddlers-and-the
       -greedy-king
       Thanks so much!

About Me

   [Seuss%2Bcharacter%2Bday%2Blily%2Breese%2Band%2BMrs%2BAyn%2BDSC05074.jp
   g]
   I have been teaching early childhood for 20+ years in both private and
   public school programs and am a big proponent of implementing Best
   Practices through play-based learning experiences. I currently teach 4
   year olds in the Lottery Funded Georgia Pre-K program in a nationally
   accredited child care center.  I served on the committee to write the
   Georgia Early Learning Development Standards (GELDS), which are aligned
   from birth through age 5, and is the framework for my teaching. I am
   also the inclusion teacher for our school  and work with children with
   a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   I am a proud member of NAEYC (National Association for the Education of
   Young Children), GAYC (Georgia Association on Young Children) and SECA
   (Southern Early Childhood Association).
   You can find me here, on little Illuminations and on the group blog,
   PreK+K Sharing blog, which is a wonderful collaboration of authors,
   bloggers, performers, teachers, therapists, administrators and
   specialist on brain development and mental health, each sharing their
   unique perspective. I am an administrator/moderator on several online
   social media groups for teachers, as well.
   I love what I do---it's the best job in the world!!! Where else can you
   go to work each day and do art, play games, have snack and get hugs
   regularly AND get paid for it?! I love to share ideas with other
   teachers and see what they are doing in their classrooms. Teaching is
   the best profession---we love to share!

Where's Wilson?: Children's Book Review

   [Wheres%2BWilson%2Bcover%2Bwm%2B20160514_112839.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   Last year, I reviewed the lovely children's book "Man In The Moon" by
   author Kelly Young-Silverman, with beautiful watercolor illustrations
   by erin the great.  I am honored to share with you their latest
   collaboration, "Where's Wilson?".
   "Where's Wilson?" is a beautiful bedtime story about the search for one
   of the counting sheep that goes missing right before bedtime. All the
   animals on the farm search for Wilson, the fourth counting sheep. How
   will the children get to sleep if they don't have all the sheep to
   count? My Pre-K class loved the rhyming text and stunning
   illustrations!
   [wheres%2Bwilson%2Billustration%2Bpage%2Bwm%2B20160514_112908.jpg]
   "Where's Wilson?" has a special little surprise: a hidden frog on each
   page, just as "Man In The Moon" had a hidden ladybug. And, like "Man In
   The Moon", a portion of the proceeds from the book is donated to St.
   Jude's Children's Hospital.
   You can purchase a copy of "Where's Wilson?" (and "Man in the Moon") on
   the author's website: Evie and Knox Stories. You will also find some
   printables and coloring pages on the Evie and Knox site!
   Happy Reading!

Primary Peach Launch Party Freebie: Quick and Easy End of the Year Gift Ideas
For Support Staff

   Today is the day ---I can finally let the cat out of the bag!!!! I am
   thrilled to be a part of a BRAND NEW collaborative teaching blog,
   written exclusively by GEORGIA teacher bloggers!!! This new blog will
   be packed with tips, tricks, ideas and treats from some of the very
   best Georgia teachers! Now, without further adieu, I present:

                           [mandy-blogbutton.png]

   And the news gets even MORE exciting! Our very first post is a BLOG HOP
   filled with End of the School Year themed FREEBIES!!!! It's hard to
   believe the school year is almost over. We've got some great goodies to
   help make your year-end craziness go just little bit smoother----each
   contributor has created a special Freebie to sweeten our Launch Party!

   [Picture3.png]
   I'm Ayn Colsh, a contributing author on the Primary Peach, as the
   resident Ga. Pre-K teacher. I've been teaching 20+ years, mostly in
   Pre-K, and and a BIG proponent of play-based, hands-on learning, I've
   been involved with the Georgia Pre-K program for 9 years now, and I
   LOVE what I do! Where else can you go to work and dress up, play, have
   snack, get dirty and have fun every day? Teaching is the BEST
   profession!  I blog about my adventures as a Georgia Pre-K teacher here
   on my personal blog, little illuminations, and am also a monthly
   contributor on the collaborative blog, PreK+K Sharing. I am married
   with two beautiful daughters, Lyndsay, 24 and Bailey, 17. We share our
   home with two dogs, Max and Ella.
   [ayn%2Bcrop%2B33430_1328526498868_7728829_n.jpg]
   Be sure to check out the "ABOUT" page on Primary Peach to meet all of
   our contributors!
   [Picture4.png]
   Now, for the sweet treat I promised you. There are always the folks
   that helped my own children in school, and have been essential to my
   life as a teacher that are often forgotten when the "Thank You" gifts
   are handed out at the end of the year. The custodians, office staff,
   bus drivers, Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapists---all those
   folks who really have a hand in making our days go smoother are often
   overlooked. Most often, it is just not easy to purchase gifts for
   everyone we'd like to thank. A few years ago, my daughter started
   taking in doughnuts for the custodians near the end of the year because
   she said especially in high school, no one ever thinks to say "thank
   you" for all they do. I made these cute little gift tags that can be
   attached to a box of donuts for them this year. You don't have to spend
   a lot to let someone know that they are appreciated. A kind gesture
   goes a LONG way!
   [DONUT%2Bgift%2Btag%2Blittleilluminations.jpg]
   You can get my FREEBIE "I 'DONUT' know what I'd do without you!" gift
   tags here!
   [original-1828993-1.jpg]
   Now, for EVEN MORE to sweeten the deal, how would you like to win a TPT
   gift certificate? We are having a Rafflecopter Giveaway too!!!! One
   lucky person will win a $50 TPT certificate and 3 more lucky folks will
   each win a $25 TPT gift certificate!!! You've got to be in it to win
   it!

The Wide Mouthed Frog

   [title%2Bpic%2Bheader%2Bwide%2Bmouthed%2Bfrog.jpg]
   Spring is here!!! We are learning about a variety of life cycles in our
   Pre-K class and reading lots of great books about animals that come out
   in the Spring. One of the favorite units is our unit on Pond Life,
   which includes all the animals found around a pond, especially frogs!
   This week, we are reading two versions of the same story about the Wide
   Mouthed Frog. Although the stories vary a little, essentially the story
   is about a frog that goes around telling smaller creatures that he has
   a big wide mouth and will eat them. Eventually, he comes across
   something bigger than himself and discovers he is the desired meal time
   snack!
      ***This post contains affiliate links for your convenience. Little
   Illuminations is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates
   Program.***
   The Big Wide Mouthed Frog by Ana Martin Larranaga is a favorite in our
   class! The kids love to help tell the story by chiming in with the
   repetitive portions of the text!
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0744567076&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinIma

   leillum08-20]
   Wide Mouthed Frog by Keith Faulkner is one of my favorites, because it
   is set in the Okefenokee Swamp, which is located in Georgia and
   Florida, so it includes creatures my students are familiar with. The
   kids love it because it is a pop-up book, and what kid doesn't just
   love a pop-up book?

Polar Bear Ice Cream Cups

     [Polar%2BBear%2BIce%2BCream%2Bcup%2Bheader%2Bpi.jpg]
   I saw the teachers making these fun little ice cream cups for the kids
   in the toddler room and I had to share them here with you! They took a
   plain vanilla ice cream cup, added banana slices for ears, chocolate
   chips (upside down) for eyes and I'm not sure about the nose but I
   think it is an upside down Hershey's Kiss. Too cute!!! We will
   definitely be making these with some of our Polar activities next year!
   Look for some other fun wintery snacks we've had lately to be posted
   here soon!

Man In The Moon: Children's Book Review

   [Man%2Bin%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Bcover%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC09708.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   I have recently had the opportunity to read a gorgeous new children's
   book by author Kelly Young-Silverman, titled "Man In The Moon". "Man in
   the Moon" is about a little girl who sees the moon and wonders what it
   must be like up there. She talks to the moon, and although he doesn't
   reply, he smiles down sweetly at her. Told in rhyming form, it is a
   very sweet story about friendship!
   [Man%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Breview%2Bwm%2BDSC09994.jpg]
   There is a special treat hidden on each page----a sweet little ladybug.
   The pictures are beautiful watercolor illustrations by the extremely
   talented Erin the Great.
   This is sure to become a favorite and is perfect for a bedtime story. I
   read it to my Pre-K class and they absolutely loved it and have asked
   to hear it again!
   You can purchase a copy of "Man in the Moon" on the author's website :
   Evie and Knox Stories. Bonus: 5% of the book's proceeds go to help St.
   Jude's Children's Hospitals.

My Doctor and Me ABC: Children's Book Review

   ** I received a digital copy of this book to preview as a gift. After
   reading and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions
   expressed in this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in
   any way. Also included in this post are my Amazon Affiliate links to
   the book.**
   If you are a regular follower of little illuminations, you know that
   one of my passions is children's literature. I love collecting it,
   reading it and especially sharing it! I try to provide my students with
   a wide variety of reading material on our bookshelf relating to the
   topic we are currently discussing. Just before beginning our study on
   community helpers, the stars aligned and I received a message asking if
   I would like to preview an e-copy of a new book for children about
   going to the doctor called "My Doctor and Me ABC" written by Dr.
   Stephanie Cox, M.D. and illustrated by Emily Burger. Score!!!

                   [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BCover%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   "My Doctor and Me ABC" is an adorably fun book that presents a healthy
   habit, body part, instrument or  medical exam component using a medical
   vocabulary word that goes with each letter of the alphabet, along with
   a little rhyme. It is like taking a mini field trip to the doctor's
   office!

                 [Doctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BX%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   The illustrations are adorable and illustrate each concept well.

              [My%2Bdoctor%2Band%2Bme%2Bletter%2BI%2Bwm.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   Dr. Stephanie Cox is a Family Physician in Iowa and enjoys caring for
   the children in her practice. She wrote the book in an effort to ease
   fears for children experiencing a doctor's visit.
   "My Doctor and Me ABC" has already received some notable attention. It
   has just won an Honorable Mention from the 2014 Readers' Choice 2014
   International Book Awards. I'm sure it will be on some of the other
   book award lists soon!
   I love the rhyming text and the use of common medical jargon. I think
   it is never too early to start helping children learn correct
   terminology--and this book does this beautifully without going over
   their heads!

             [My%2BDoctor%2Band%2BMe%2BLetter%2BF%2Bwm%2B.jpg]
    Photos from "My Doctor a.nd Me ABC" used with permission from author

   I read the book to my class and they LOVED it! I would definitely
   recommend getting this book for children before visiting the doctor's
   office or for teachers to use when learning about health and wellness
   or doctors/community helpers.
   If you would like to purchase the book, you may click on my Amazon

   health. Stop by and give her page a "like" and be sure to let her know

Going To The Doctor: Our Community Helpers

   [Going%2BTo%2BThe%2BDoctor%2Btitle%2Bheader%2BPicMonkey%2BCollage.jpg]
   ****Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links.****
   Going to the doctor can be scary for kids. When we talk about community
   helpers, I always include discussions and books about people in the
   medical profession. We talk about why it is important to have regular
   check-ups, going for sick visits and even immunizations. No one likes
   getting a shot, and preschoolers are often even more apprehensive since
   they are precisely at an age where many of the booster immunizations
   are administered. I think helping children know what to anticipate
   during a visit can be reassuring and helps to alleviate some of the
   fear. Whenever possible, I try to have parents (doctors, nurses,
   pharmacists, etc.) come in and share what they do.
   One of our parents (a doctor) came to visit and shared a sweet book
   called "What's In A Doctor's Bag?" by Neil Shulman and Sibley Fleming.
   She then pulled out items from her doctor's bag and demonstrated each
   item. Later, she let the kids explore and experiment with the items.
   The children listened to their heartbeats and had their reflexes
   tested.

   [going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bshot%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC07742.jpg]
   In our small groups later in the week, children made a little doctor
   kit, placing some of the first aid supplies inside while discussing
   what each item was used for.
   [Going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bmaking%2Bdoctor%2Bkits%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC07

   [Going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bdoctors%2Bkit%2Boutside%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BD
   SC07822.jpg]
   We had a pharmacist (another parent) come to speak to our class. She
   talked about medicines, first aid and spreading germs. We did a great
   little experiment on spreading germs. She added some fine glitter to a
   bottle of hand sanitizer to simulate germs and gave two children a
   little squirt to rub on their hands. Each child shook hands with
   another student and that student continued to pass on the handshake.
   After everyone had finished, we looked at our hands. Even though only
   two people had the hand sanitizer germs, almost everyone had a little
   glitter on their hands! This really helped illustrate the concept of
   spreading germs in a concrete way.

   After talking about simple wound care (such as bug bites, cuts and
   scrapes), she gave use a little first aid kit for our class. We already
   have a pretty extensive first aid kit both in our classroom and in our
   school office, but this one is perfect to use on the fly for field
   trips.

   One of our neighboring classes did a cute craft about x rays. The
   students traced around their arms with chalk on black paper and glued
   cotton swabs to represent bones on the x ray. Too cute!!!!

   I am so fortunate to have such great parents that are willing to come
   in to share their occupations with the class! I think many of the
   children's fears were eased by getting to know our community helpers
   and asking questions. Thank you, Dr. Syed, and Mrs. Williams for
   sharing your time and expertise with us!

14 "Must-See" Sunday School Bulletin Boards, Doors and More!

   [Holy%2BComforter%2BBulletin%2BBoards%2Bcollage%2Btitle%2Bwm.jpg]
   While the norm here on little illuminations is posting about our
   adventures in Pre-K, I have recently started teaching Sunday School.
   We've had a small team of angels (especially Kristy and Lori) that
   worked tirelessly to make our Sunday School rooms bright, energetic and
   inviting. The decor is just SO fabulous, that I had to share them here
   with you!
   Our Sunday School program is centered around stations that the children
   (ages K-5) rotate through on various weeks. Stations include art,
   drama/storytelling, science, games and cooking. We also have  nursery,
   preschool and middle school rooms.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Brainbow%2Btrail%2Bwm%2BDSC07486%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bdor%2Bwm%2BDSC07474%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Biam%2Brainbow%2Bwm%2BDSC07484%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Byoufit%2Bpuzzle%2Bwm%2BDSC07477%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I just love this rainbow and cloud! It makes the room such a cozy place
   for children to curl up with a book!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07485%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07487%2Bcrop.jpg]
   This cross is just beautiful! Made by placing tape in the shape of a
   cross and painting stripes of color over it. When dry, remove the tape.
   I want to make one of these to hang in my home!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Band%2Bballs%2Bwm%2BDSC07481%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Bcloseup%2Bwm%2BDSC07482%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love this Noah's Ark wall mural! Even the youngest members of our
   church are blessed with gorgeous surroundings!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bnoahs%2Bark%2Bwm%2BDSC07488%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The theme in our art/cooking/science is "God is the Master
   Artist…Master Chef…Master Scientist…Master of All Creations".
   Don't you just love this giant paint brush and palette in our art area?
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bpaint%2Bwm%2BDSC07475%2Bcrop.jpg]
   These decorations in our cooking area are just too sweet!!!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bsweets%2Bwm%2BDSC07476%2Bcrop.jpg]
   In our drama room, this is a great way to "spotlight" our learning
   focus each week.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bspotlight%2Bwm%2BDSC07489%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love the Imagination Station! It just pops with color and creativity!
   The theme is "Gears...Setting our minds on God."
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bapps%2Bwm%2BDSC07483%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bgear%2Bup%2Bwm%2BDSC07479%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Blove%2Bthe%2BLord%2Bgears%2Bwm%2BDSC07480%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The pièce de résistance is this FABULOUS 3-D Albert Einstein bulletin
   board!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Beinstein%2Bwm%2BDSC07473%2Bcrop.jpg]
   We are SO blessed to have such creative folks leading the way for our
   Christian Education program! They have done such a wonderful job to
   make this an exciting and inviting space for our younger members of the
   church family.
   I love to hear your thoughts---share them in the comment section
   below!

Where's Wilson?: Children's Book Review

   [Wheres%2BWilson%2Bcover%2Bwm%2B20160514_112839.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   Last year, I reviewed the lovely children's book "Man In The Moon" by
   author Kelly Young-Silverman, with beautiful watercolor illustrations
   by erin the great.  I am honored to share with you their latest
   collaboration, "Where's Wilson?".
   "Where's Wilson?" is a beautiful bedtime story about the search for one
   of the counting sheep that goes missing right before bedtime. All the
   animals on the farm search for Wilson, the fourth counting sheep. How
   will the children get to sleep if they don't have all the sheep to
   count? My Pre-K class loved the rhyming text and stunning
   illustrations!
   [wheres%2Bwilson%2Billustration%2Bpage%2Bwm%2B20160514_112908.jpg]
   "Where's Wilson?" has a special little surprise: a hidden frog on each
   page, just as "Man In The Moon" had a hidden ladybug. And, like "Man In
   The Moon", a portion of the proceeds from the book is donated to St.
   Jude's Children's Hospital.
   You can purchase a copy of "Where's Wilson?" (and "Man in the Moon") on
   the author's website: Evie and Knox Stories. You will also find some
   printables and coloring pages on the Evie and Knox site!
   Happy Reading!

Primary Peach Launch Party Freebie: Quick and Easy End of the Year Gift Ideas
For Support Staff

   Today is the day ---I can finally let the cat out of the bag!!!! I am
   thrilled to be a part of a BRAND NEW collaborative teaching blog,
   written exclusively by GEORGIA teacher bloggers!!! This new blog will
   be packed with tips, tricks, ideas and treats from some of the very
   best Georgia teachers! Now, without further adieu, I present:

   [UlfmxLbk_xef4yJ3pLFTPKo_9HVNeXsPmFZlymdTHBn6jODTzD_xNlconkka5rHUqZqmZ9
                 gG2J59luhyJzVIwwbE4dwSoIWffA5uy-dz208=s0-d]

   And the news gets even MORE exciting! Our very first post is a BLOG HOP
   filled with End of the School Year themed FREEBIES!!!! It's hard to
   believe the school year is almost over. We've got some great goodies to
   help make your year-end craziness go just little bit smoother----each
   contributor has created a special Freebie to sweeten our Launch Party!

   [Picture3.png]
   I'm Ayn Colsh, a contributing author on the Primary Peach, as the
   resident Ga. Pre-K teacher. I've been teaching 20+ years, mostly in
   Pre-K, and and a BIG proponent of play-based, hands-on learning, I've
   been involved with the Georgia Pre-K program for 9 years now, and I
   LOVE what I do! Where else can you go to work and dress up, play, have
   snack, get dirty and have fun every day? Teaching is the BEST
   profession!  I blog about my adventures as a Georgia Pre-K teacher here
   on my personal blog, little illuminations, and am also a monthly
   contributor on the collaborative blog, PreK+K Sharing. I am married
   with two beautiful daughters, Lyndsay, 24 and Bailey, 17. We share our
   home with two dogs, Max and Ella.
   [ayn%2Bcrop%2B33430_1328526498868_7728829_n.jpg]
   Be sure to check out the "ABOUT" page on Primary Peach to meet all of
   our contributors!
   [Picture4.png]
   Now, for the sweet treat I promised you. There are always the folks
   that helped my own children in school, and have been essential to my
   life as a teacher that are often forgotten when the "Thank You" gifts
   are handed out at the end of the year. The custodians, office staff,
   bus drivers, Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapists---all those
   folks who really have a hand in making our days go smoother are often
   overlooked. Most often, it is just not easy to purchase gifts for
   everyone we'd like to thank. A few years ago, my daughter started
   taking in doughnuts for the custodians near the end of the year because
   she said especially in high school, no one ever thinks to say "thank
   you" for all they do. I made these cute little gift tags that can be
   attached to a box of donuts for them this year. You don't have to spend
   a lot to let someone know that they are appreciated. A kind gesture
   goes a LONG way!
   [DONUT%2Bgift%2Btag%2Blittleilluminations.jpg]
   You can get my FREEBIE "I 'DONUT' know what I'd do without you!" gift
   tags here!
   [original-1828993-1.jpg]
   Now, for EVEN MORE to sweeten the deal, how would you like to win a TPT
   gift certificate? We are having a Rafflecopter Giveaway too!!!! One
   lucky person will win a $50 TPT certificate and 3 more lucky folks will
   each win a $25 TPT gift certificate!!! You've got to be in it to win
   it!

The Wide Mouthed Frog

   [title%2Bpic%2Bheader%2Bwide%2Bmouthed%2Bfrog.jpg]
   Spring is here!!! We are learning about a variety of life cycles in our
   Pre-K class and reading lots of great books about animals that come out
   in the Spring. One of the favorite units is our unit on Pond Life,
   which includes all the animals found around a pond, especially frogs!
   This week, we are reading two versions of the same story about the Wide
   Mouthed Frog. Although the stories vary a little, essentially the story
   is about a frog that goes around telling smaller creatures that he has
   a big wide mouth and will eat them. Eventually, he comes across
   something bigger than himself and discovers he is the desired meal time
   snack!
      ***This post contains affiliate links for your convenience. Little

   The Big Wide Mouthed Frog by Ana Martin Larranaga is a favorite in our
   class! The kids love to help tell the story by chiming in with the
   repetitive portions of the text!

   Wide Mouthed Frog by Keith Faulkner is one of my favorites, because it
   is set in the Okefenokee Swamp, which is located in Georgia and
   Florida, so it includes creatures my students are familiar with. The
   kids love it because it is a pop-up book, and what kid doesn't just
   love a pop-up book?

Polar Bear Ice Cream Cups

     [Polar%2BBear%2BIce%2BCream%2Bcup%2Bheader%2Bpi.jpg]
   I saw the teachers making these fun little ice cream cups for the kids
   in the toddler room and I had to share them here with you! They took a
   plain vanilla ice cream cup, added banana slices for ears, chocolate
   chips (upside down) for eyes and I'm not sure about the nose but I
   think it is an upside down Hershey's Kiss. Too cute!!! We will
   definitely be making these with some of our Polar activities next year!
   Look for some other fun wintery snacks we've had lately to be posted
   here soon!

Man In The Moon: Children's Book Review

   [Man%2Bin%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Bcover%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC09708.jpg]
   **I received a copy of this book to preview as a gift. After reading
   and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions expressed in
   this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in any way..**
   I have recently had the opportunity to read a gorgeous new children's
   book by author Kelly Young-Silverman, titled "Man In The Moon". "Man in
   the Moon" is about a little girl who sees the moon and wonders what it
   must be like up there. She talks to the moon, and although he doesn't
   reply, he smiles down sweetly at her. Told in rhyming form, it is a
   very sweet story about friendship!
   [Man%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMoon%2Bbook%2Breview%2Bwm%2BDSC09994.jpg]
   There is a special treat hidden on each page----a sweet little ladybug.
   The pictures are beautiful watercolor illustrations by the extremely
   talented Erin the Great.
   This is sure to become a favorite and is perfect for a bedtime story. I
   read it to my Pre-K class and they absolutely loved it and have asked
   to hear it again!
   You can purchase a copy of "Man in the Moon" on the author's website :
   Evie and Knox Stories. Bonus: 5% of the book's proceeds go to help St.
   Jude's Children's Hospitals.

My Doctor and Me ABC: Children's Book Review

   ** I received a digital copy of this book to preview as a gift. After
   reading and enjoying, I agreed to write a review. The opinions
   expressed in this post are my own. I was not compensated financially in
   any way. Also included in this post are my Amazon Affiliate links to
   the book.**
   If you are a regular follower of little illuminations, you know that
   one of my passions is children's literature. I love collecting it,
   reading it and especially sharing it! I try to provide my students with
   a wide variety of reading material on our bookshelf relating to the
   topic we are currently discussing. Just before beginning our study on
   community helpers, the stars aligned and I received a message asking if
   I would like to preview an e-copy of a new book for children about
   going to the doctor called "My Doctor and Me ABC" written by Dr.
   Stephanie Cox, M.D. and illustrated by Emily Burger. Score!!!

   "My Doctor and Me ABC" is an adorably fun book that presents a healthy
   habit, body part, instrument or  medical exam component using a medical
   vocabulary word that goes with each letter of the alphabet, along with
   a little rhyme. It is like taking a mini field trip to the doctor's
   office!

   The illustrations are adorable and illustrate each concept well.

   Dr. Stephanie Cox is a Family Physician in Iowa and enjoys caring for
   the children in her practice. She wrote the book in an effort to ease
   fears for children experiencing a doctor's visit.
   "My Doctor and Me ABC" has already received some notable attention. It
   has just won an Honorable Mention from the 2014 Readers' Choice 2014
   International Book Awards. I'm sure it will be on some of the other
   book award lists soon!
   I love the rhyming text and the use of common medical jargon. I think
   it is never too early to start helping children learn correct
   terminology--and this book does this beautifully without going over
   their heads!

   I read the book to my class and they LOVED it! I would definitely
   recommend getting this book for children before visiting the doctor's
   office or for teachers to use when learning about health and wellness
   or doctors/community helpers.

Going To The Doctor: Our Community Helpers

   [Going%2BTo%2BThe%2BDoctor%2Btitle%2Bheader%2BPicMonkey%2BCollage.jpg]
   ****Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links.****
   Going to the doctor can be scary for kids. When we talk about community
   helpers, I always include discussions and books about people in the
   medical profession. We talk about why it is important to have regular
   check-ups, going for sick visits and even immunizations. No one likes
   getting a shot, and preschoolers are often even more apprehensive since
   they are precisely at an age where many of the booster immunizations
   are administered. I think helping children know what to anticipate
   during a visit can be reassuring and helps to alleviate some of the
   fear. Whenever possible, I try to have parents (doctors, nurses,
   pharmacists, etc.) come in and share what they do.
   One of our parents (a doctor) came to visit and shared a sweet book
   called "What's In A Doctor's Bag?" by Neil Shulman and Sibley Fleming.
   She then pulled out items from her doctor's bag and demonstrated each
   item. Later, she let the kids explore and experiment with the items.
   The children listened to their heartbeats and had their reflexes
   tested.

   [going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bshot%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BDSC07742.jpg]
   In our small groups later in the week, children made a little doctor
   kit, placing some of the first aid supplies inside while discussing
   what each item was used for.

   [Going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bdoctors%2Bkit%2Boutside%2B%2Bwm%2Bcrop%2BD
   SC07822.jpg]
   We had a pharmacist (another parent) come to speak to our class. She
   talked about medicines, first aid and spreading germs. We did a great
   little experiment on spreading germs. She added some fine glitter to a
   bottle of hand sanitizer to simulate germs and gave two children a
   little squirt to rub on their hands. Each child shook hands with
   another student and that student continued to pass on the handshake.
   After everyone had finished, we looked at our hands. Even though only
   two people had the hand sanitizer germs, almost everyone had a little
   glitter on their hands! This really helped illustrate the concept of
   spreading germs in a concrete way.

   After talking about simple wound care (such as bug bites, cuts and
   scrapes), she gave use a little first aid kit for our class. We already
   have a pretty extensive first aid kit both in our classroom and in our
   school office, but this one is perfect to use on the fly for field
   trips.

   One of our neighboring classes did a cute craft about x rays. The
   students traced around their arms with chalk on black paper and glued
   cotton swabs to represent bones on the x ray. Too cute!!!!
   [going%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bdoctor%2Bx%2Bray%2Bcrop%2Bwm%2BDSC07802.jpg]
   I am so fortunate to have such great parents that are willing to come
   in to share their occupations with the class! I think many of the
   children's fears were eased by getting to know our community helpers
   and asking questions. Thank you, Dr. Syed, and Mrs. Williams for
   sharing your time and expertise with us!

14 "Must-See" Sunday School Bulletin Boards, Doors and More!

   [Holy%2BComforter%2BBulletin%2BBoards%2Bcollage%2Btitle%2Bwm.jpg]
   While the norm here on little illuminations is posting about our
   adventures in Pre-K, I have recently started teaching Sunday School.
   We've had a small team of angels (especially Kristy and Lori) that
   worked tirelessly to make our Sunday School rooms bright, energetic and
   inviting. The decor is just SO fabulous, that I had to share them here
   with you!
   Our Sunday School program is centered around stations that the children
   (ages K-5) rotate through on various weeks. Stations include art,
   drama/storytelling, science, games and cooking. We also have  nursery,
   preschool and middle school rooms.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Brainbow%2Btrail%2Bwm%2BDSC07486%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bdor%2Bwm%2BDSC07474%2Bcrop.jpg]

   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Byoufit%2Bpuzzle%2Bwm%2BDSC07477%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I just love this rainbow and cloud! It makes the room such a cozy place
   for children to curl up with a book!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07485%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Brainbow%2Bcloud%2Bwm%2BDSC07487%2Bcrop.jpg]
   This cross is just beautiful! Made by placing tape in the shape of a
   cross and painting stripes of color over it. When dry, remove the tape.
   I want to make one of these to hang in my home!

   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bcross%2Bcloseup%2Bwm%2BDSC07482%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love this Noah's Ark wall mural! Even the youngest members of our
   church are blessed with gorgeous surroundings!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bnoahs%2Bark%2Bwm%2BDSC07488%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The theme in our art/cooking/science is "God is the Master
   Artist…Master Chef…Master Scientist…Master of All Creations".
   Don't you just love this giant paint brush and palette in our art area?
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bpaint%2Bwm%2BDSC07475%2Bcrop.jpg]
   These decorations in our cooking area are just too sweet!!!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bsweets%2Bwm%2BDSC07476%2Bcrop.jpg]
   In our drama room, this is a great way to "spotlight" our learning
   focus each week.
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bspotlight%2Bwm%2BDSC07489%2Bcrop.jpg]
   I love the Imagination Station! It just pops with color and creativity!
   The theme is "Gears...Setting our minds on God."
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bapps%2Bwm%2BDSC07483%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Bgear%2Bup%2Bwm%2BDSC07479%2Bcrop.jpg]
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Blove%2Bthe%2BLord%2Bgears%2Bwm%2BDSC07480%2Bcrop.jpg]
   The pièce de résistance is this FABULOUS 3-D Albert Einstein bulletin
   board!
   [1%2Bhc%2Bbb%2Beinstein%2Bwm%2BDSC07473%2Bcrop.jpg]
   We are SO blessed to have such creative folks leading the way for our
   Christian Education program! They have done such a wonderful job to
   make this an exciting and inviting space for our younger members of the
   church family.
   I love to hear your thoughts---share them in the comment section

About Me

   [Seuss%2Bcharacter%2Bday%2Blily%2Breese%2Band%2BMrs%2BAyn%2BDSC05074.jp
   g]
   I have been teaching early childhood for 20+ years in both private and
   public school programs and am a big proponent of implementing Best
   Practices through play-based learning experiences. I currently teach 4
   year olds in the Lottery Funded Georgia Pre-K program in a nationally
   accredited child care center.  I served on the committee to write the
   Georgia Early Learning Development Standards (GELDS), which are aligned
   from birth through age 5, and is the framework for my teaching. I am
   also the inclusion teacher for our school  and work with children with
   a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   I am a proud member of NAEYC (National Association for the Education of
   Young Children), GAYC (Georgia Association on Young Children) and SECA
   (Southern Early Childhood Association).
   You can find me here, on little Illuminations and on the group blog,
   PreK+K Sharing blog, which is a wonderful collaboration of authors,
   bloggers, performers, teachers, therapists, administrators and
   specialist on brain development and mental health, each sharing their
   unique perspective. I am an administrator/moderator on several online
   social media groups for teachers, as well.
   I love what I do---it's the best job in the world!!! Where else can you
   go to work each day and do art, play games, have snack and get hugs
   regularly AND get paid for it?! I love to share ideas with other
   teachers and see what they are doing in their classrooms. Teaching is
   the best profession---we love to share!

       Ayn,
       I am a big fan of your blog and I have started a new project called
       Aristoddlers. The goal of the project is to help kids learn some
       Ancient Greek and Roman lessons through entertaining stories. I
       have written my first book Aristoddlers and The Greedy King. If you
       or any of your followers would like me to send you a proof of the
       book I would be happy to and here is the link on Kickstarter:
       http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490457402/aristoddlers-and-the
       -greedy-king
       Thanks so much!

About Me

   [Seuss%2Bcharacter%2Bday%2Blily%2Breese%2Band%2BMrs%2BAyn%2BDSC05074.jp
   g]
   I have been teaching early childhood for 20+ years in both private and
   public school programs and am a big proponent of implementing Best
   Practices through play-based learning experiences. I currently teach 4
   year olds in the Lottery Funded Georgia Pre-K program in a nationally
   accredited child care center.  I served on the committee to write the
   Georgia Early Learning Development Standards (GELDS), which are aligned
   from birth through age 5, and is the framework for my teaching. I am
   also the inclusion teacher for our school  and work with children with
   a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   I am a proud member of NAEYC (National Association for the Education of
   Young Children), GAYC (Georgia Association on Young Children) and SECA
   (Southern Early Childhood Association).
   You can find me here, on little Illuminations and on the group blog,
   PreK+K Sharing blog, which is a wonderful collaboration of authors,
   bloggers, performers, teachers, therapists, administrators and
   specialist on brain development and mental health, each sharing their
   unique perspective. I am an administrator/moderator on several online
   social media groups for teachers, as well.
   I love what I do---it's the best job in the world!!! Where else can you
   go to work each day and do art, play games, have snack and get hugs
   regularly AND get paid for it?! I love to share ideas with other
   teachers and see what they are doing in their classrooms. Teaching is
   the best profession---we love to share!

       Ayn,
       I am a big fan of your blog and I have started a new project called
       Aristoddlers. The goal of the project is to help kids learn some
       Ancient Greek and Roman lessons through entertaining stories. I
       have written my first book Aristoddlers and The Greedy King. If you
       or any of your followers would like me to send you a proof of the
       book I would be happy to and here is the link on Kickstarter:
       http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490457402/aristoddlers-and-the
       -greedy-king
       Thanks so much!
