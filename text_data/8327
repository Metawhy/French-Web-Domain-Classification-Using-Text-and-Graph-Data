Picture Perfect documenting with Nathalie

   [October_Kit-Love-%2528ALL%2529.jpg]
   Hi there!
   Nathalie with you today with a focus highlight on one of the
   Subscriber-only cut files.   Each month, our subscribers receive a
   collection of perks -cut files, cut apart elements, extra PL cards-,
   and today i want to share a few ideas on how to use the PICTURE PERFECT
   cut file, and this month's AT MY TABLE Life Crafted kit and the Mini
   Halloween Kit.
   Let's get started with a Life Crafted layout:
   [CTK_1stDAY%2BPICTURE_Oct%252719_Nathalie%2BDeSousa.jpg]
   This month's AT MY TABLE kit is gorgeous, versatile and completely
   perfect for this story of my daughter's last first day of school
   picture (she is graduating HS this year).
   [CTK_1stDAY%2BPICTURE_Oct%252719_Nathalie%2BDeSousa_close%2Bups-2.jpg]
   I pulled the Life Crafted Screen  of the Picture Perfect cut file to
   create the title page for this layout.  I simply cut the screen to fit
   the page, and backed it with one of the Digital TN papers (the contrast
   of yellow and blue/teal is a fave of mine) then created a cluster on
   the middle of the page using elements from the kit.  I really love the
   floral paper, and had fun fussy cutting the images, and then there is
   the mini alpha stickers...
   [CTK_1stDAY%2BPICTURE_Oct%252719_Nathalie%2BDeSousa_close%2Bups.jpg]
   For the other side of my layout, i chose to create a cluster of papers
   and ephemera at the top corner of the layout.   I tried to repeat the
   same elements as in the title page,  so that the two sides are cohesive
   and then just added my lines of journal and a few more stamped
   sentiments from the TN stamp set.  Just love how this turned out.
   Let's now check a second option using the PICTURE PERFECT cut file and
   the mini Halloween kit:
   [CTK_BOO%2BCREW_Oct%252719_NATHALIE%2BDESOUSA-3.jpg]
    The mini Halloween kit features the new Crate Paper - Hey Pumpkin
   collection, and i couldn't resist creating  a page from one of our old
   Halloween memories.
   [CTK_BOO%2BCREW_Oct%252719_NATHALIE%2BDESOUSA_close%2Bups-2.jpg]
   This time, i am using the second format of the cut file and cut it from
   white cardstock.  I used some of the papers from the kit to back a few
   of the empty spaces of the cut file  - mixing solid cardstock, with
   patterned paper and some icons-  and attached it to the background
   using some foam adhesive.
   [CTK_BOO%2BCREW_Oct%252719_NATHALIE%2BDESOUSA_close%2Bups-4.jpg]
   A bit of black paint (Pinkfresh Studio watercolor available in the CTK
   shop) on the background makes all the details of the cut stand out, as
   well as all the clusters of embellishments around the page.  To finish
   this page, i added a few stamped sentiments inside the empty film strip
   spots using the TN stamp set and gold ink.
   The following video will show you how this all came together:

   I hope this gives you a few ideas on how to work the many subscriber
   perks on your documenting.   Remember to check all the kits, tools and
   digital files in the CTK shop, and consider subscribing ( if you are
   not a subscriber already)so you can have access to all the CTK
   exclusives.
   As always, please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions on
   how this came together.  I cannot wait to see what you create with this
   month's kits!!

Sunday Sketch with Lorilei

   Happy Sunday!  Lorilei here today sharing a layout I made with the
   colourful and vibrant October Add-On kit!  I am using a sketch today
   for my layout, and I decided to go with the Truly Grateful part of the
   Add-On kit!
   Here is a look at the sketch I will be using:
   [Oct-6-Sketch.jpg]
   I stuck pretty close to the main layout of the sketch, as I love the
   design.  Using a sketch made my layout come together super quickly!  My
   first step was to select a photo and then get started!
   [CTK-Lorilei_Murphy-Grateful-01.jpg]
   I trimmed Paper 6 into the largest mat following the sketch; I added a
   photo mat using the Amy Tangerine "Slice of Life" paper (b-side). The
   pink paper beneath the embellishment is the b-side of Paper 6.
   [CTK-Lorilei_Murphy-Grateful-02.jpg]
   Once I had my papers trimmed up, I added some paint splatters to my
   background using pink and gold spray mist.  When the paint had dried, I
   added my paper stacks to the background.  I chose the stay golden die
   cut from the Truly Grateful Ephemera Pack and a large floral as well.
   I decided to fussy cut some leaves from Paper 23 for extra
   embellishments!  I also fussy cut one butterfly from Paper 5.  I added
   little sequins to the wings of the butterfly from the Sparkle kit!
   [CTK-Lorilei_Murphy-Grateful-03.jpg]
   To finish up, I added one of the gorgeous puffy words as my title and
   scattered the leaves above and below the focal point area on the
   sketch!  I love how my layout turned out!
   [CTK-Lorilei_Murphy-Grateful-04.jpg]
   I'd love for you to try the sketch!  I can imagine many lovely ways to
   use it with the October Add-On kit!  Thanks so much for stopping by
   today!

3-To-Inspire with Marsha

   [October_3-To-Inpsire.jpg]
   Hey friends!  Marsha here today with this week's 3-to-Inspire
   challenge.  This is one of my favorite challenges, because it's such a
   great way to get your creativity flowing by focusing on three key
   elements.
   Here are the prompts:
   1. Play with hexagons
   2. Use a cut file
   3. Add PURPLE
   Here is my take on the challenge:
   [10-5%2B3-to-Inspire1.jpg]
   For my project, I used the October Scrapbooking Add-on Kit, the Life
   Crafted "At My Table" Kit, and a subscriber exclusive cut file- Screen
   4.  I love the bright colors in the kits this month, especially the
   gorgeous purple!  In my opinion, it's not used nearly enough in
   scrapbooking products!
   I decided to create a layout in my Life Crafted album documenting a fun
   photo taken at my grandmother's 90th birthday party earlier this year.
    I began by cutting out the cut file using white cardstock.  I layered
   it over a piece of grid patterned paper from the Add-on kit, trimmed to
   5"x8.25" (to fit in the LC album).  Next, I backed several of the
   hexagons with patterned papers from the Life Crafted kit, also adding
   foam behind one of the hexagons for added interest.  For the title, I
   used some puffy phrase stickers from the Pink Paislee Truly Grateful
   collection, found in the Add-on kit.  To embellish the page, I added
   some ephemera pieces, a butterfly, and a puffy heart sticker, all from
   the kits.
   [IMG_9651.jpg]
   [IMG_9653.jpg]
   [IMG_9663.jpg]
   For the other page, I added a piece of purple patterned paper behind my
   photo.  I trimmed out a couple more hexagon shapes and added them
   around the page.  This made the spread more cohesive by using this
   shape on both sides of the layout.  Next, I used some puffy stickers
   and ephemera pieces to embellish.  Using the Life Crafted Stamp, I
   added some stamping to some of the clusters.  I also added some
   hand-written journaling to each side of my photo.  I prefer the look of
   typewriter or computer printed journaling, but it's nice sometimes to
   use my own handwriting, even if it is imperfect.
   [IMG_9647.jpg]
   [IMG_9645.jpg]
   I love how this layout came together using these amazing kits!
   Here's one final look at the spread:
   [10-5%2B3-to-Inspire1.jpg]
   Thank you for stopping by today!  I can't wait to see your take on this
   3-to-Inspire challenge.  Be sure you share it with us on the Fan
   Facebook Page or on Instagram using #citrustwistkits!

MEET OUR GUEST DESIGNER: BARBARA PICINICH

   [Blog%2Bpost%2Bslide%2B1.jpg]
   Hello everyone!
   We are so excited to introduce our October 2019 Guest Designer to you
   all.  We have been following her work for a while, and find it always
   so fresh and beautiful, so we had to ask her to join us this month, and
   she said, "YES!".   So please help us welcome BARBARA PICINICH to
   Citrus Twist Kits for this month.  You are going to love her and her
   work!
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------
   [BPicinich%2Bheadsot%2Bcircle.png.jpg]
   GET TO KNOW BARBARA
   Hello everyone, my name is Barbara and I am a true California native
   having lived most of my life near San Francisco in the Bay Area. Today
   I live in the Central Valley of California near the State Capital of
   Sacramento.  I live with my husband of twenty years and our almost
   twelve year old daughter. We love to travel and we are big fans of
   Disney parks and we also love spending time in Lake Tahoe and Yosemite.
   When I'm not scrapbooking I spend my free time sipping coffee, browsing
   Instagram, reading, binge watching TV shows, watching YouTube videos
   and going to the movies with my husband as often as we can.
   You can find me on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/babz510/
   and I do have a blog where I share the projects I make
   http://thepicinicbasket.blogspot.com/
   and I also have a YouTube channel where I share flip thru videos of
   mini albums which is currently my most recent December Daily albums
   https://www.youtube.com/user/Babz510/featured
   Q& A with BARBARA
   1.       When did you start scrapbooking?
   I started scrapbooking in 1999 right after I got married. My very first
   project was my wedding album, talk about starting big! Once that was
   done I moved on to traditional layouts of family trips and events. I
   was never a consistent scrapbooker in the early days but in 2007 when
   my daughter was born I picked it back up again to document her first
   year and haven’t stopped since. One thing led to another and I now have
   a home full of scrapbooks, layouts and mini albums that I love so much.
   These days my favorite ways to scrapbook is to make pocket page albums,
   mini books and Travelers Notebooks. I don’t worry about being caught up
   any more and make projects based on the inspiration I find in products,
   stamps and kits. I love just going with the flow and not worrying about
   being current all the time.
   2.       What is something most people would not know about you?
   I’m a makeup and beauty junkie! I love makeup so much that my last
   corporate job was working in the regional sales office of MAC Cosmetics
   as an Executive Assistant and Office Manager. It’s an industry that I
   have always loved and its one that I’m still super drawn to and
   continue to be inspired by daily. I had the best job in the world and
   worked with some of the most creative and inspiring people every day
   and I got to be surrounded by makeup and talk about makeup and be with
   makeup every day. Talk about a creative high, it was the best! But I
   left that job when my daughter was born and I have been a stay at home
   mom ever since but I still love makeup and watch trends and stay on top
   of all of the latest releases like it’s still my job. I’m also super
   into watching makeup tutorials on YouTube in my spare time, it’s so
   much fun and I love it!
   3.       What are the 3 scrapbooking products you can’t live without?
   Well it’s not a traditional product per say, but I cannot live without
   my Canon printer. I print everything at home because I like to edit and
   decide sizes on the fly. I can’t predict where I’m heading so I need to
   have the flexibility to print at home. Next would be good black ink. I
   love to stamp with black ink and having good ink that I know will give
   a crisp impression is a must. My favorite is Staz-on mainly because I
   like to stamp a lot on vellum so it’s a must for that. Lastly I would
   say embellishments, a project is just not done for me if I can’t add a
   little heart or star or a die cut. I like things with dimension and
   embellishments are where it’s at for me and a project is never complete
   without a little something something.
   4.       What do you love about the October Life Crafted kit – AT MY
   TABLE-?
   Based on what I said in question three I bet you can already predict my
   answer, the embellishments! I really loved the die cuts in the kit this
   month and the little puffy hearts were exactly what I love to add to my
   pages. The colors and the different shapes and themes were really fun
   to use.
   5.       Finish this sentence “If you could see my scrapbooking space
   now . . . “
   It would not look like the photos below but it will very soon. I love
   my space so much and I especially love how much work and time my
   husband put in to giving me the space I wanted. He built my standing
   desk for me to fit into an existing alcove in our home and it’s just
   perfect. I love having a space that I can get messy in and I’m very
   much a messy scrapbooker. My work surface typically has layers and
   layers of things crowding the space but as soon as I’m done I clean up,
   even in between projects. I need to mentally clear the decks and have a
   fresh canvas and clean space to begin again.
   [BPicinich_CraftSpace_01.jpg]
   [BPicinich_CraftSpace_03.jpg]
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   I’m super excited to share the first project I made with the At My
   Table Life Crafted Kit! I have been in love with the Life Crafted
   albums since they came out and just finished adding the last layout to
   my first album. I just love having a space for Travelers Notebook sized
   projects especially since that’s a size that I’m completely drawn to
   right now.
   [BPicinich_GuestProject1_01.jpg]
   This kit gave me everything I love in a kit; there are embellishments,
   there are super cute stamps and there are little pops of gold in the
   accents. Not to mention it was food related and what’s not to love
   about documenting fun food adventures. When I saw all the soft colors
   and pretty floral accents I knew I had the perfect photos for this
   project.
   [BPicinich_GuestProject1_02.jpg]
   When planning out projects I always start with photos and for this
   particular day I had many to choose from so I had to edit them down to
   a manageable number that would fit on a travelers notebook sized space.
   For me the photos always come first so I’m always trying to come up
   with ways to fit as many as I can on to a layout while still leaving
   room for the pretty stuff. In this case I had four photos that I felt
   really told the story of the day and sized them to 2.25” x 3.25”.  The
   next part of the process for me is laying out the photos then placing
   some of the larger embellishments that I know for sure I want to use on
   the spread.
   [BPicinich_GuestProject1_03.jpg]
   Layering pieces is key for me so figuring out placement is important. I
   like to lay everything out and then once I’m happy with the look I
   start to stick everything down. I’m not big on a lot of adhesive for
   several reasons; one you just don’t need that much and two, I tend to
   change my mind so using less means I can carefully lift stuff up and
   move it around.
   [BPicinich_GuestProject1_04.jpg]
   When I’m laying out my key embellishments I am also keeping stamps in
   mind. It’s important to leave room or at least plan out what items I
   might want to stamp on while I’m coming up with my layout. In this case
   these little die cuts were perfect for stamping a few of the sentiments
   on. I love how dainty they are and I love how they are the exact right
   scale for this project and the photos.
   [BPicinich_GuestProject1_05.jpg]
   This main embellishment cluster is my favorite part of the spread; I
   think it’s all the layers and the little bits of gold from the alpha
   stickers. These little stickers were perfect to spelling out the name
   of the café we visited and the digital tag was the perfect little
   accent to the kit die cuts. I also had the perfect amount of space for
   the tiny stamped sentiment which was my favorite one on that stamp set.

Life Crafted with Tina

   [October_Life-Crafed.jpg]
   Hello CTK friends!
   It's Tina here and today I want to share with you my first project
   created with the gorgeous October "At My Table" Life Crafted kit and
   the Traveler's Notebook stamp. Nevertheless all the beautiful colors of
   the pattern paper were so tempting to create something fall inspired, I
   decided to stick to the theme of the kit and documented these funny
   photos of my daughter eating pasta.
   [1.jpg]
   I started by grabbing two page protectors #1 and trimmed the orange
   pattern paper to fit into one of them. After that I printed my
   journaling on a vellum, adhered it to the pattern paper and added fussy
   cut flowers at the top of the page. Using tiny alpha stickers I created
   a title and in the end I added an ephemera piece at the bottom.
   [2.jpg]
   [3.jpg]
   [4.jpg]
   After that I lessened another page protector #1 with my fuse tool to
   fit a 3x8 card. I decided to keep this page simple and added just a
   photo and amazing heart puffy stickers.
   [5.jpg]
   At the back of the 3x8 journaling card I created a new background using
   a 3x4 "I was made for this" card and a 4x6 floral card. Then I trimmed
   purple and off-white pattern paper to fit into the page protector #3,
   printed another piece of journaling and fussy cut the flowers from the
   rest of the floral card. I wanted to use one of the golden puffy words
   stickers, but the one I chose didn't fit on the page, so I simply
   attached it to the page protector itself and so I did with a cute
   light-blue puffy heart sticker. To finish this spread I stamped a few
   food related phrases here and there, and added a word "lunch" using
   tiny alpha stickers.
   [6.jpg]
   [7.jpg]
   [8.jpg]
   So that's all for today! I hope you'll be inspired by this month's kit
   as much as I do and will love to see your creations! Be sure to share
   your projects on the CTK Fan Page on Facebook or on Instagram using
   #citrustwistkits!

Christmas Daily with Krystal

   [October-%2BChristmas%2BDaily.jpg]
   Hi everyone! Krystal here with the very first look at my December Daily
   album for 2019! I'm so excited to share this with all of you, and I'm
   definitely getting revved up to start documenting the holiday season.
   [CTK_Oct2_flatlay1.jpg]
   I knew that I wanted to keep my December Daily album very simple this
   year. The holiday season is so busy for all of us, and I've found that
   keeping my documenting simple makes me infinitely more likely to
   complete my album in a reasonable amount of time. That's why I was so
   excited to use the Christmas Stories kit and album for my 2019 DD.
   Having a kit to work from makes it so simple to put everything
   together!
   [CTK_Oct2_flatlay2.jpg]
   Now, on to the actual album. I started with my title page, of course. I
   knew that I wanted it to be a full-size page outside of a pocket, and I
   knew that I wanted to use one of the gorgeous gold puffy Phrase
   Thickers. I chose Paper 8 from Pink Paislee's Together for Christmas as
   my background. I love the graphic nature of the black and white plaid,
   and I knew that I would be able to use both sides of the paper for my
   title and intentions page.
   [CTK_Oct2_flatlay3.jpg]
   I added some of the adorable candy-cane stripe puffy Thickers from
   Heidi Swapp's Winter Wonderland collection to finish out my title and
   backed it with a strip of the Counting Down paper from Pebbles Merry
   Little Christmas collection. Then I finished off the page by adding
   some trims from my stash. I love how simple the page is , but that it
   still sets a fun tone for the rest of the album.
   [CTK_Oct2_flatlay4.jpg]
   I also decided to create some really basic foundation pages. I used
   Paper 12 from Together for Christmas to number all of my days, then
   found coordinating papers from the kit to match each square number. I
   used a mix of Life Crafted Page Protectors to keep things interesting
   and added in a few pages outside of the pockets as well.
   [CTK_Oct2_flatlay5.jpg]
   So far, nothing is adhered down yet, so I'll have lots of room to
   switch things up and move things around during December when I start
   adding my photos, journaling, and embellishments. I just wanted to have
   something in my album to give myself a starting point, and so that I
   didn't end up with blank-page paralysis.
   I'm really happy with how my album is coming together so far, and I
   love how easily it was to put together using the Christmas Stories kit!
   The video below gives you a closer look at my process.

   Thanks so much for stopping by! I hope you are inspired to start
   planning your holiday album, and be sure to stop by the shop to pick up
   a Christmas Stories kit of your very own! 😊
