diy {pallet headboard}

   And just in time for the weekend.. the long awaited pallet headboard!

   IMG_7707

   I’m excited to (finally) share this project! It’s the biggest project
   I’ve shared to date. Turning pallets into furniture or decor is nothing
   new, this I know. Last January, my wish of having a headboard became a
   reality, using, you guessed it, a pallet (or two…and a couple other
   supplies)! Thanks to my father in law who occasionally has spare
   pallets in his warehouse, we were able to make a unique headboard for
   around $20. The project spanned about 2 days, working an hour or so
   here and there. I was able to do some of it by myself, but needed
   Tristan’s help for other parts. I hope to give you enough tips and
   information so you can make your own headboard. If you have any
   questions, I’d be more than happy to try to answer the best I can.
   Leave a message at the bottom of this post, or send me an email at
   {ricedesignblog (at) gmail (dot) com}. I’d love to hear from you and
   I’d love to help if I can!

   Our Supplies:

   Pallets (we used two pallets, because some of the boards split as I was
   taking them apart and some were in bad condition).

   2x4s for the frame (Two pieces at 66 inches each. Two at 48 inches)

   Hardware- 4 nuts/bolts/washers (these attach the headboard to the metal
   bed frame) and a box of screws (to attach the pallet boards to the
   frame and make the frame. We used black screws so they’d blend in on
   the front).

   A drill and a hammer.

   A crowbar would have been super helpful for pulling the pallets apart.
   Hindsight.

   Sand paper, stain and polyeurethane (and a foam brush/rag for the
   stain, a brush for the poly).

   As an afterthought- white paint to paint the frame. This is totally
   unnecessary, though, because you don’t really see the frame.

   A level. We didn’t use one, it was just pure luck (and good
   eye-balling) that the thing turned out straight, even and square.

   IMG_7705

   What We Did:

   1. I started by pulling the boards off the pallets. This was actually
   really hard! Whoever makes pallets isn’t playing around. I used a
   hammer to pound each board loose and then pry them up. A crowbar
   would’ve been nice. Or something to wedge and get some leverage. I was
   able to get a bunch off, but needed Tristan’s muscles to loosen others.

   2. Tristan went to Home Depot to get the supplies. They cut the 2x4s to
   size. Two at 66 inches. Two at 48 inches. The 2x4s make the frame for
   the headboard.

   This is where things get a little weird. Talk about winging it. If we
   made another headboard, I’d do it differently.

   3. We laid one of 66 inch long 2×4 on the ground, horizontally. Then we
   started laying the pallet boards on top of the 2×4, going vertically.
   The pallet boards need to be perpendicular to the 2×4. This is where a
   level would come in handy. We alternated different widths and made the
   top intentionally uneven. Some were higher/lower than others. But as a
   general rule of thumb, the 2×4 was 7 inches from the top of the pallet
   boards. Once we had them laid out, Tristan went down the line and
   screwed them all into place. (I would definitely recommend pre-drilling
   holes for the screws!) The screws were driven through the front of the
   pallet boards, so the black made them blend in a little, but I still
   like that you can kind of see them.

   So at this point, all the pallet boards are attached to a 2×4 about 7
   inches from the top of the pallet boards.

   4. Then we needed to attach them to the other 2×4. So we slid the other
   66″ 2×4 under all the pallets. It is 24 inches from the top (2×4).
   Tristan went down the line, screwing all the pallet boards to this 2×4.
   This, again, is where a level would have come in handy. I’m so grateful
   the thing came out even and square and not completely wonky!

   5. Our metal hollywood frame has 2 plates to attach a headboard. The
   plates are 53 inches apart, so the vertical (2x4s) of the frame needed
   to be 53 inches apart, so we could bolt it to the headboard.

   6. So Tristan measured and screwed each 48 inch 2×4, going vertically,
   3 inches in from each side. This made them 53 inches apart. He used 4
   screws to attach each to the top horizontal (2×4) and 4 screws to
   attach to the bottom. (The vertical 2x4s were screwed directly into the
   horizontal 2x4s. The picture below will, hopefully, make more sense).

   I hope this picture helps explain some of the measurements. And makes
   those instructions somewhat understandable.

   Page 1

   Let’s all pretend my handwriting on that picture doesn’t look like a 5
   year old, OK?! I’m new to this ‘write on a picture’ thing!

   7. Then we took the whole thing outside and I sanded it down really
   well and put one coat of poly on. (Hindsight- it’d probably be easier
   to sand down the pallet boards before they were screwed to the frame.)
   I wasn’t sure if I wanted to stain the wood or not. In hindsight, I
   should have sanded, stained and poly-ed the headboard and then attached
   it to the bed. Oh, hindsight.

   8. We brought the headboard inside and Tristan bolted it to the metal
   bed frame, using nuts, bolts and washers. He put 4 bolts on one side
   and then decided two bolts was more than enough, so he only used 2 on
   the other side.

   IMG_6800

   This photo shows how the headboard bolts to the metal frame. And also
   that I quit painting the frame white at the bottom. I don’t really know
   why. The other side is painted. Must have gotten distracted. When using
   2 bolts, use 1 above and 1 below.

   So at this point, the headboard is sanded and has one coat of poly. And
   it’s attached to the bed. And I’m thrilled!

   IMG_0126

   This is an instagram shot taken right after the headboard was attached.
   Back when our room was still light blue. And the bed was on a different
   wall. What’s hard to see in this photo in how some of the boards have a
   pink-ish hue to them… which leads me too…

   A couple months down the road, I decided that I did, in fact, want to
   stain it. I’m very glad that I only put on one coat of poly. I pulled
   the mattress off the bed, opened all the windows, and stained it (still
   attached to the bed). There wasn’t enough poly on it so the stain went
   on just fine.

   A couple months later I stained it a bit darker, and finished it with
   wax. It has such a lovely matte, soft finish. The dark stain also
   helped cancel out some of the pink-ish tones in the wood.

   And then I painted the frame white. You barely ever see the frame,
   unless you’re standing beside the head of the bed. It looks more
   finished being white and not bare 2×4.

   I kinda want to take a saw to the top of it and make it straight, but
   Tristan likes it as is, so uneven it’ll stay… for now!

   IMG_7698

   We use crates as our nightstands. I stacked two apples crates and
   painted them white. I love crates. Since they don’t have a lot of
   surface area, I saved space by using clamp lamps as our bedside lights,
   and clamping them to the headboard. They’re just office lamps, but I
   actually really like them! They’re simple and clean and give a sort of
   industrial-ish look. I found them at Home Depot, I think.

   IMG_7687

   And there it is! The {diy pallet headboard}! I debated cutting the top
   of the headboard to make it straight. But since we added the shelf, I
   like it uneven. The straight, clean line of the shelf compensates for
   the uneven-ness of the headboard! If you have any questions, leave them
   in the comments below or send me an email!

   (originally posted 2/1/13. updated on 3/22/13)

   Update 3/26/2013- A commenter shared this link about the safety
   concerns of using pallets. My apologies for not including this in the
   original post. When we got our pallets, my husband looked into it and
   felt safe that the pallets we were using were OK. You may want to look
   into the safety concerns of pallets and make sure the ones you want to
   use are safe! Happy crafting!

            thanks! I’m going to keep it uneven… partially because it’d be
            a pain to take outside and cut down!

       This looks great! But I hate to be the debbie downer of the group …
       most shipping pallets contain harsh pesticides to stop cross
       contamination of invasive insects as the wood moves across borders.
       Unless these were specifically treated to leach the chemicals out,
       you might have an issue here. Not all pallets, mind you, but some
       of them.

            Thanks for the link! Not a debbie downer to point out a health
            concern! When we got the pallets from my father in law, my
            husband did his research and looked at the pallets and felt
            safe that the ones we were using were OK. I’m going to update
            the post to add this link, so people can do their due
            diligence before they use pallets for a headboard or whatever
            other craft project. Thanks for your comment! :)

            Thanks! Our metal frame was handed down to us, but you can buy
            them most places you can buy mattresses/furniture. They’re
            sometimes called Hollywood frames. Department stores might
            sell them. I did a quick search and it looks like Walmart even
            has them! Hope this helps!

   Is it just me, or did this week go by really quickly? It was a big week
   for RICE, from being featured on Remodelista, to having 3 projects on
   the front page of craftgawker, and seeing a steady rise in readership.
   It’s quite exciting. I thoroughly enjoy sharing ideas, projects and the
   likes. My love of all things handmade really grew as I was planning my
   wedding in 2008. But even before then, when I was living at home in
   high school, I perpetually rearranged (and repainted) my room. I’ll
   never forget that one time I put a putrid lavender-pink color on one
   wall. I have no idea what made me do that. It was dreadful. Thankfully
   paint is an easy fix! Anyway, this morning I’m sharing another roundup.
   My goal for Fridays will be to share a roundup and then I’ll come back
   and share a project for the weekend. {spoiler- the project today will
   be our diy headboard!}

   Chalkboard walls. I used to not like them. I’m not sure why. Maybe
   because they were everywhere. But then, one day, I couldn’t resist any
   longer. And now they’re one of my favorite things. Especially when
   they’re done like this one!

   Annie Sloan Chalk paint is my favorite. It’s so easy to work with. It’s
   really durable. And it comes in my favorite color. They call it Arles.
   I call it perfect.

   So when I saw this picture- a mustardy table beside a chalkboard wall,
   my heart skipped a beat. How’s that for dramatic. (I don’t know the
   source of this photo. If it is yours or you know who it belongs to,
   please let me know!)

   no reason at all. Or make one for yourself!

   Head over here to get the recipe for Hearty Chicken Stew with Butternut
   Squash and Quinoa. It is so delicious. Warm, satisfying and hearty just
   like the title says. And it’s pretty. I’m making it again this weekend.

   Come back this afternoon to see our {diy headboard}! I’m very excited
   to finally share it!

   I have a thing for chalkboard walls. Perhaps they make me feel
   nostalgic. I used to play school as a kid like it was my job. And who
   didn’t love to write on the chalkboard in grade school. Chalkboards in
   the home are fun and functional, if you ask me. They’re easy to make.
   They’re inexpensive. And if you ever get tired of it you can just (prep
   and) paint over it! We have two chalkboards in our home- one in the
   living room by G’s little table and one in the dining room, right off
   the kitchen. I thought I’d share a little roundup of chalkboard walls
   to get you inspired! I’ve never done it, but I’ve seen all sorts of
   recipes online for making your own chalk paint. Does it work well? I’d
   love to hear if you’ve made your own chalkboard paint!

   Chalkboard walls make a nice backdrop for hanging your pots and pans on
   the wall.

   Another chalkboard in the kitchen. I do wonder, though, if it’d get
   really greasy next to the stove? That’s one of the reasons I haven’t
   painted our kitchen backsplash with chalkboard paint… I’m not sure how
   well it’d hold up and if it’d quickly look really grungy.

   If you aren’t sure about painting a wall, what about painting something
   to lean against the wall, like this old door? Charming!

   Or what about on this wooden tray turned message center? Very fun!

   I don’t know the source of this picture. If you do, or it’s yours,
   please let me know!

   I love this chalkboard in the bathroom.. and especially that perfectly
   well loved yellow chair.

   There’s no limit on the fun that can be had with chalkboard paint. From
   small scale, like the tray above, to larger, like entire walls, there’s
   so much that can be done! Hopefully tomorrow I’ll be back to show our
   chalkboard walls, as well as G’s new big boy room!

RICE HAS MOVED!

   You should head over to ricedesignblog.com! There’s still some tweaking
   to be done, but the new site is up! I’ll be back soon for some details
   about the move, but for now I just have to step away from the computer
   screen and enjoy the beautiful weather (and perhaps tackle the mountain
   of laundry)! Have a great day!

   It seems that maybe, hopefully, spring has finally arrived! Have a
   great weekend. See you back here on Monday!

diy {business cards}

   I’ve been needing to make more business cards, but wanted to do
   something different than I had before. I envisioned using tags (the
   ones that look like manila file folders and have the reinforced hole at
   the top) and having simple, black type. I played around on the
   computer, trying to design something using Word (publishing layout) but
   never got anything I loved. I thought about printing on labels, and
   then sticking the labels to the tags. But that idea never really got me
   excited. What I really wanted was a stamp. I love stamps. I thought
   having a stamp would be multi-functional. I could use it for business
   cards and tags and different branding. It’d be perfect. I browsed Etsy,
   looking at custom stamps, but they were a little out of my price range.
   And the idea of committing to one stamp was just too much for me. What
   if I wanted to change it? Or what about when my domain name changes
   (I’m in the process of getting a new website!)… a stamp seemed so…
   permanent. How’s that for over-thinking?

   So I did a good, old fashioned Google image search (for custom stamp
   business card), hoping for another option, and sure enough, a Design
   Sponge post came up near the top. I had my answer.

   Tristan came home for lunch, and instead of being a good wife and
   sharing lunch together, I dashed to Staples to pick up my supply. Yes.
   Supply. Singular. Just one thing. And it’s quite possibly my most
   favorite crafting supply of the moment.

   It’s a custom stamp kit.

   IMG_8333


   The one online was still a little more money than I wanted to spend (my
   Craig’s List sales money is only so big) but I figured I’d go and see
   what I found. I was thrilled when it was nearly $10 cheaper in the
   store than online!

   You use those tweezers to pick out each letter and put it on the stamp
   thing. The letters are pretty small (there are two sizes- small and
   smaller). It takes some time to put on the letters on and get them
   lined up, but it wasn’t nearly as tedious as I thought.

   IMG_8439


   I wrote out what I wanted to stamp. There are multiples of each letter,
   but I made sure I’d have enough to spell out what I wanted. I
   alternated sizes (bigger size on the first line, smaller next, bigger,
   smaller). You’re basically just spelling the words backwards.

   IMG_8354


   These are the larger letters. Or, as I said, small and smaller.

   IMG_8345


   You push them right onto the stamp thing. I centered mine. Or kind of
   centered it. The letters can kind of move once they’re on, so you can
   slide them around to get them lined up.

   It comes with a stamp pad (in black) that worked really well. I did a
   couple test stamps on scrap paper and then went to town stamping my
   tags.

   IMG_8365


   Speaking of tags. You can find them at craft stores, but they’re
   cheaper at office supply stores. I think these were $5 for 100. Which
   is like 20 cents a business card. Totally doable.

   IMG_8370


   IMG_8383


   They’re called shipping tags and they’re great. A craft supply must
   have, if you ask me.

   IMG_8386


   They turned out even better than I imagined. I love them! The best way
   to get a clean, crisp stamp is to carefully put the stamp onto the
   paper (don’t let it shift around) and then give the top a nice little
   tap with your hand. Like a hammer.

   IMG_8422


   Aren’t they great?! I really love them. And the stamp in
   multi-functional! I’ll use it for tags and other crafts. The set also
   came with another stamp thing, so I can make another one! The ideas are
   just swirling around my head.

   IMG_8433


   I’m going to make a branch tree of sorts, to hang the tags from. For
   now they’re hanging from a jewelry hook hanger tree thing I got at
   thrift store and (shockingly) spray painted gold!

   I’m so happy with my business cards. They’re easy to make and the stamp
   in multi-functional. And if I need to change it, I can! I have a
   feeling I’m going to be stamping a lot of things around here!

round up {kitchen organization}

   If you like RICE on Facebook (which you definitely should!), you might
   have seen this picture already…

   kitchen


   There’s a little kitchen organization project in the works over here!
   It’s not quite finished yet, so I thought I’d do a little round up of
   kitchen organization to get you inspired…

   potrack1


   A Beautiful Mess

   I love pegboard pot racks in the kitchen. I really love black pegboard
   pot racks. And I love reclaimed wood projects. So I think this photo is
   just pretty great all around. I made my own pegboard and wrote about it
   here. The area looks a lot different now, though!

   corkfridge

   MarthaStewart

   A cork covered fridge. Brilliant! You could make an ugly fridge pretty
   and functional with some cork tiles. You can also get rolls of cork,
   similar to drawer liners, but it isn’t very thick. I love this idea.

   kitchen1

   The Inspired Room

   I love the use of shelves in this photo. Using jars is a great and
   attractive way to store dried food!

   pantry

   DesignSponge

   If this isn’t a beautifully organized pantry, I don’t know what is! Not
   only is the shelving amazing, but the baskets and glass jars look
   lovely.

   kitchen2

   MichaelPenneyStyle

   Taking the doors off your cabinets is an easy way to get the open
   shelving look. It’s great if you’re a renter (you can put the doors
   back on) and you can also test out the open shelf idea to see if you
   like it. I like the way the space above the cabinets is used with those
   big baskets. Functional and pretty. I also love the black window frame,
   the step stool (which I think is Ikea) and the white tile floor.

   door

   MommyPage

   How creative to use an old door to organize your kitchen. Perfect for
   renters! Paint it to match your kitchen and attach some hooks and art.
   So inventive. Don’t forget to attach it to the wall, especially if you
   have kids running around!

   labels

   You should head over here to get these printable chalkboard labels for
   your kitchen, spice jars and pantry. They’re amazing! Emily McDowell is
   so talented and so kind to make and share them. There are tons of
   labels like the ones above that you can print to use in your kitchen!

   How do you have your kitchen organized? Have any tips or tricks to
   share? Check back soon to see our little kitchen organization project!

round up {outside}

   I’m hopeful that the cold weather is behind us and warm days are in our
   future! I’m so ready to open the windows and dig in the dirt! I’m going
   to try my hand at a vegetable garden again. I did one last year. And
   then I weeded it twice and the morning glories took over and it became
   a jungle. A big, abandoned jungle. Since I’m hopeful that warm weather
   is just around the corner, I thought I’d share some outside inspiration
   pictures!

   porch


   source

   Is that a charming front porch, or what? I was trying to think of a
   place I could put corrugated metal like that, but I don’t know where
   it’d go. I love the way it looks as a backdrop for those gorgeous pots!

   planters

   There’s a great tutorial to make those planters on wheels over on
   Gardenista! Maybe I have a thing for corrugated metal.. it’s the
   backdrop for these lovely plants, too!

   outside chalkboard

   source

   How fun would it be to have a giant chalkboard outside? It’d be cute to
   have an outdoor dinner party and write the menu on it!

   mason jars

   source

   How charming would it be to hang some mason jars from the trees and
   enjoy some candlelight in the yard?

   pallet walkway

   source

   I love pallets and I really like the idea of using them to make a
   walkway!

   rocking chair swing

   source

   I’m pretty good at finding cheap, junky chairs. I’d love to turn one
   into a swing!

   I can’t wait for the weather to warm up so we can spend some time
   working outside! Do you have any projects waiting for warm weather? Are
   you a gardener (or are you trying to be one, like me)?

when someone gives you a brick….

   … don’t get mad… get crafty?!

   A couple months ago, someone gave us a brick. By way of throwing it. At
   our windshield. So for a couple months, we’ve had this lone brick
   sitting around our house. I’ve seen bricks dressed up and used in
   different ways, most often as book ends. But it didn’t occur to me
   until I saw this post on craftgawker that I should turn our gifted
   brick into something fun. When life hands you lemons…. you know!

   IMG_8087


   the brick before

   I slapped some white paint on it (acrylic craft paint- if it was warmer
   I would have spray painted it gold) and then sat staring at it, unsure
   what to do next. I started making black polka dots on it, but didn’t
   like it, so I wiped the black off and painted it white again. I had
   white cotton clothesline sitting on my desk, and it caught my eye. I
   decided to wrap it around the brick. I just winged it and ended up
   wrapping it in stripes.

   IMG_8151

   Who would have thought that a brick that withstands being thrown at a
   windshield (and busting the windshield) would break when I start
   wrapping rope around it. And did you know that hot glue doesn’t really
   stick to bricks.. or maybe it was the paint that was on the brick.
   Either way, I’ll be honest and say this project, which was supposed to
   be simple and quick, didn’t quite go as planned! The rope holds the
   broken brick together, but it needs to be handled gently. I never
   thought I’d say to Gabe, “Be careful with the brick.. it’s fragile!” If
   I made another one, I’d use different paint (either spray paint or
   latex wall paint) because the acrylic craft paint got kind of chalky,
   weird feeling.

   IMG_8156

   But the end result is kind of fun. And it adds a little something to
   the books in my crates. And the brick has a story.

   IMG_8139

   Perhaps you’ve never been gifted a brick. Don’t feel left out. You can
   probably buy them at a place like Home Depot. You could make a ton of
   brick bookends for what a gifted brick ends up costing!

   IMG_8153

   I guess it’s not technically a book end if it sits on top of the books!

   IMG_8168


   I like the different textures of the painted brick and the rope. I hope
   you’ve never been gifted a brick the way we were. Have any of you
   gotten crafty with bricks? What did you make?
