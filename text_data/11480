   Deep in the heart of West Africa, Vodou (Togo); Vodoun (Benin), or more
   familiarly, Voodoo (Haiti) is not only alive and well, but it is
   thriving.

   Togo’s capital city of Lomé is the birthplace of the largest Voodoo
   market in the world – a kind of super supply store for fetishes, charms
   and anything else one might need for a ritual. The Akodessewa Fetish
   Market, or Marche des Feticheurs, is a place where you can find
   anything from leopard heads and human skulls to Vodou (voodoo) priests
   who bless and create fetishes or predict the future and make medicines
   to heal whatever ails you.

   Though many people think of Haiti as Voodoo’s biggest stronghold, the
   religion originated in West Africa. Vodoun is the official religion of
   neighboring Benin and is still the largest religion in the area, which
   is obvious given that the outdoor market’s location is in the heart of
   Togo’s capital. Although the market is owned and run by Beninese. The
   Akodessewa Fetish Market is a mecca to local practitioners and they
   travel there from all over the African continent.  Many believers view
   the Marche des Feticheurs as a kind of hospital or pharmacy – it is the
   place you go when you either cannot afford traditional treatment or
   traditional treatment has failed you. Here you can find talismans and
   charms good for treating everything from the flu or infertility to
   removing the blackest of curses.

   In the practice of Voodoo every single creature is potent and divine,
   whether alive or dead, and in the Akodessewa Fetish Market you may find
   them all – monkeys, alligators, goats, leopards, gazelles, and many,
   many more – in various stages of decay and stacked up in macabre piles
   for blocks. The outdoor location doesn’t quite suppress the stench but
   at least the huge market is in the open air. It is a jarring place for
   tourists who are not used to the idea of animal sacrifice as part of
   worship or using pieces of the dead as talismans, but for locals who
   practice the religion, it is a treasure and a necessity.

Know Before You Go

   Open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Four kilometres from the centre, it can
   be accessed by taxi or taxi-moto. There is a fee for taking photos.

   Lítla Dímun is the smallest of the Faroe Islands’ 18 main islands. But
   though it may be tiny, the islet still has the power to influence the
   atmosphere.

   A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket.
   These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other
   protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top,
   occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward
   the cold sea.

   Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one
   that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For
   centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla
   Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep.

   Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the
   little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep
   were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the
   Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in
   the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to
   domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun,
   scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to
   the main islands.

Know Before You Go

   You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the
   villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible
   to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good
   enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the
   farmers to help climb the cliffs.

   Lítla Dímun is the smallest of the Faroe Islands’ 18 main islands. But
   though it may be tiny, the islet still has the power to influence the
   atmosphere.

   A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket.
   These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other
   protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top,
   occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward
   the cold sea.

   Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one
   that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For
   centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla
   Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep.

   Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the
   little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep
   were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the
   Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in
   the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to
   domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun,
   scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to
   the main islands.

Know Before You Go

   You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the
   villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible
   to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good
   enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the
   farmers to help climb the cliffs.

   Driving in the Faroe Islands can be daunting: there are sheep blocking
   the roads, the weather is unpredictable, and fog can sweep in at any
   time. But the unilluminated one-lane tunnels may be the biggest
   challenge drivers face.

   The mountainous terrain of the Faroe Islands has always been difficult
   for the people living there. Until tunnels were constructed,
   entire villages remained isolated, accessible only via long hikes or by
   sea.

   Though the tunnels were indeed a useful addition, they can make for
   some hairy driving. Driving through the one-lane tunnels can be
   challenging and invoke a feeling of horror-filled joy in even the most
   experienced driver.

   The one-lane tunnels have passing places spaced about 330 feet apart,
   where cars heading in opposite directions can yield to one another.
   When approaching one of these tunnels, you’ll want to make sure there’s
   a fair amount of distance between you and any other cars, so everyone
   can ensure they have access to one of these passing places. You’ll also
   need to keep your headlights on while you’re on the move, as the
   tunnels are usually pitch black.

   But as with most rules, there are exceptions as to who is expected to
   yield. The passing places are too small for buses or trucks, so they
   automatically get the right-of-way, even if the passing space is on
   their side of the road. If you encounter a truck or bus, you’ll have to
   pull over to “their” side of the road, turn your lights off, and wait
   for them to pass.

Know Before You Go

   There are 10 one-lane tunnels spread out over the Faroe Islands.

   Deep in the heart of West Africa, Vodou (Togo); Vodoun (Benin), or more
   familiarly, Voodoo (Haiti) is not only alive and well, but it is
   thriving.

   Togo’s capital city of Lomé is the birthplace of the largest Voodoo
   market in the world – a kind of super supply store for fetishes, charms
   and anything else one might need for a ritual. The Akodessewa Fetish
   Market, or Marche des Feticheurs, is a place where you can find
   anything from leopard heads and human skulls to Vodou (voodoo) priests
   who bless and create fetishes or predict the future and make medicines
   to heal whatever ails you.

   Though many people think of Haiti as Voodoo’s biggest stronghold, the
   religion originated in West Africa. Vodoun is the official religion of
   neighboring Benin and is still the largest religion in the area, which
   is obvious given that the outdoor market’s location is in the heart of
   Togo’s capital. Although the market is owned and run by Beninese. The
   Akodessewa Fetish Market is a mecca to local practitioners and they
   travel there from all over the African continent.  Many believers view
   the Marche des Feticheurs as a kind of hospital or pharmacy – it is the
   place you go when you either cannot afford traditional treatment or
   traditional treatment has failed you. Here you can find talismans and
   charms good for treating everything from the flu or infertility to
   removing the blackest of curses.

   In the practice of Voodoo every single creature is potent and divine,
   whether alive or dead, and in the Akodessewa Fetish Market you may find
   them all – monkeys, alligators, goats, leopards, gazelles, and many,
   many more – in various stages of decay and stacked up in macabre piles
   for blocks. The outdoor location doesn’t quite suppress the stench but
   at least the huge market is in the open air. It is a jarring place for
   tourists who are not used to the idea of animal sacrifice as part of
   worship or using pieces of the dead as talismans, but for locals who
   practice the religion, it is a treasure and a necessity.

Know Before You Go

   Open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Four kilometres from the centre, it can
   be accessed by taxi or taxi-moto. There is a fee for taking photos.

   Lítla Dímun is the smallest of the Faroe Islands’ 18 main islands. But
   though it may be tiny, the islet still has the power to influence the
   atmosphere.

   A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket.
   These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other
   protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top,
   occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward
   the cold sea.

   Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one
   that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For
   centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla
   Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep.

   Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the
   little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep
   were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the
   Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in
   the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to
   domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun,
   scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to
   the main islands.

Know Before You Go

   You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the
   villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible
   to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good
   enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the
   farmers to help climb the cliffs.

   A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket.
   These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other
   protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top,
   occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward
   the cold sea.

   Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one
   that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For
   centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla
   Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep.

   Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the
   little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep
   were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the
   Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in
   the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to
   domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun,
   scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to
   the main islands.

Know Before You Go

   You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the
   villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible
   to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good
   enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the
   farmers to help climb the cliffs.

   Driving in the Faroe Islands can be daunting: there are sheep blocking
   the roads, the weather is unpredictable, and fog can sweep in at any
   time. But the unilluminated one-lane tunnels may be the biggest
   challenge drivers face.

   The mountainous terrain of the Faroe Islands has always been difficult
   for the people living there. Until tunnels were constructed,
   entire villages remained isolated, accessible only via long hikes or by
   sea.

   Though the tunnels were indeed a useful addition, they can make for
   some hairy driving. Driving through the one-lane tunnels can be
   challenging and invoke a feeling of horror-filled joy in even the most
   experienced driver.

   The one-lane tunnels have passing places spaced about 330 feet apart,
   where cars heading in opposite directions can yield to one another.
   When approaching one of these tunnels, you’ll want to make sure there’s
   a fair amount of distance between you and any other cars, so everyone
   can ensure they have access to one of these passing places. You’ll also
   need to keep your headlights on while you’re on the move, as the
   tunnels are usually pitch black.

   But as with most rules, there are exceptions as to who is expected to
   yield. The passing places are too small for buses or trucks, so they
   automatically get the right-of-way, even if the passing space is on
   their side of the road. If you encounter a truck or bus, you’ll have to
   pull over to “their” side of the road, turn your lights off, and wait
   for them to pass.

Know Before You Go

   There are 10 one-lane tunnels spread out over the Faroe Islands.

   Abandoned before it was finished, this cathedral stands as a reminder
   of the Middle Ages, a time when its small village was a cultural and
   religious hub within the Faroe Islands.

   Not a lot is known about the half-built St. Magnus Cathedral, which was
   erected sometime in the 13th century but never completed. Even still,
   it remains a major draw in Kirkjubøur, the southernmost village on
   Streymoy, one of the 18 of the Faroe Islands.

   Since 1997, conservation efforts have kept the cathedral ruins from
   further disintegrating. The preservation project has also increasingly
   drawn visitors to Kirkjubøur.

   St. Magnus Cathedral is located at the southern tip of Kirkjubøur, next
   to the family farmhouse and St. Olav’s church, both structures dating
   to the year 1110 and still in use today. In fact, the farmhouse is
   occupied by the 13th generation of the Patursson family. Family
   patriarch and arguably among the most famous of Faroese artists, glass
   artist and sculptor Tróndur Patursson lives in a hillside home just up
   the road from the village’s more prominent landmarks. (His house is the
   one with all the beautiful glasswork on the facade.)

Know Before You Go

   In addition to the typical guided tours, the village is easily reached
   by public bus from Torshavn, and it's popular to hike between the
   seaside village and capital city on a path over the grassy,
   sheep-grazed hillsides in between, which is (relatively) well-marked
   with cairns.

Faroe Islands

Lake Sørvágsvatn

The largest lake in the Faroe Islands seems to be held hundreds of feet above
sea level thanks to an optical illusion.

   Lake Sørvágsvatn is 3.4 square kilometers in size, more than three
   times the size of the second biggest lake among the Faroe archipelago,
   Fjallavatn, and when viewed from above it appears to be contained far
   above the surrounding ocean.

   When viewed from afar, its seems that the lake is tilted towards the
   ocean, but only spills over in one small waterfall. This optical
   illusion also creates the impression that the reservoir is located
   hundreds of feet above sea level. In actuality, the elevation
   difference between the lake and the ocean is only about 30 meters,
   however, steep and significant elevation changes in the surrounding
   hills give the lake its seemingly impossible look. The lake is situated
   in a deep depression, and its towering headland on the 252 and 376
   meters on the left and right sides.

   There is also some controversy regarding the lake’s name since the
   people of Sørvágsvatn village take pride in naming the body of water
   after their home, while the citizens of some of the other nearby towns
   would rather call the lake, “Leitisvatn” since some of its waters
   intersect with their towns as well. Yet regardless of what the waters
   are called, the illusion they create is nothing less than nature
   pulling a big prank on all of us.

   A Nykur is a mythical beast of Scandinavian folklore. It’s often
   depicted as an aquatic monster that takes the shape of a gray,
   horse-like creature with inverted hoofs. The Nykur generally appears on
   the lakeshore, with half its body in the water, and looks to be quite
   tame to its unsuspecting victims.

   The legendary Nykur (also known as the “Nix” in English) uses its
   beauty to lure passersby to pet and mount it, and once an unsuspecting
   man, woman, or child does so, the beast’s “sticky skin” traps them in a
   terrifying barrel roll as it drags them down to the bottom of the lake
   to drown. This legend is mostly invoked by parents of small children,
   to scare them away from the edge of dangerous bodies of water.

   The Nykur’s one weakness is that if someone calls its name aloud, the
   creature will lose all of its power and retreat to the depths from
   which it came. And the Faroese legends say that once, a small child
   happened to see a Nykur roaming through the shallow water of Lake
   Sørvágsvatn while he was out playing. In awe of the creature’s beauty,
   the child approached the Nykur. The child wanted his brother, Niklas,
   to see the pretty horse as well, so he called out to him. Since the
   child was still small and unable to speak properly, he accidentally
   shouted the word “Nykur” instead of “Niklas.” Thus having spoken the
   creature’s name, it lost all its power and returned to the deep cold
   waters of lake Sørvágsvatn to try its luck another day.

   On the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands, a silver statue of the
   mythical Nykur rises from the northern tip of Lake Sørvágsvatn. The
   statue was created by local artist Pól Skarðenni, and appeared in the
   waters of the lake in 2017. Nearby, a plaque tells the legend of this
   sinister beast.

Know Before You Go

   You have to pass this statue if you are heading to Torshavn from
   the Vágar airport. It is well visible from main road. There is also a
   turn off to access the lake and get a closer look if you like.

   The tiny village of Gásadalur in the Faroe Islands sits at the edge of
   a tall cliff overlooking the sea. A ring of tall mountains cuts it off
   from the rest of its own island, and, for most of its existence, from
   the rest of the world at large.

   Prior to 2004, there were only a couple of ways to get
   to Gásadalur Village. One option was to hike over the mountain terrain
   that surrounds the settlement, which rises over 2,000 feet high, and
   then trek for even more miles to the village. The other option was to
   clamber up the cliff face from any ship brave enough to venture that
   close to the rocks. In the 1940s a staircase was built into the cliff
   rocks to make travel a bit easier, but other than that, progress in
   terms of making the remote village accessible was almost nil.

   Because of this isolation, the population of the village fell
   dramatically despite a number of good, workable fields in their
   landlocked region. The number of citizens had dropped into the teens by
   the time a tunnel was blasted through one of the mountains allowing
   automobile travel to the small community.

   While the hope is that the population will grow with the use of the
   access tunnel, as of 2012 the reported population is still only 18.
   However the smaller population has ensured that the historically quaint
   houses and unspoiled vistas all around will stay around a bit longer.

The Remarkable Story of a Woman Who Preserved Over 30 Years of TV History

Thousands of hours of Marion Stokes’s personal recordings will now be
digitized, one tape at a time.

   by Noor Al-Samarrai April 29, 2019

   The Remarkable Story of a Woman Who Preserved Over 30 Years of TV
   History

   Project</em>, a new documentary by Matt Wolf. Marion Stokes pictured in

   About 71,000 VHS and Betamax cassettes are sitting in boxes, stacked
   50-to-a-pallet in the Internet Archive’s physical storage facility in
   Richmond, California, waiting to be digitized. The tapes are not in
   chronological order, or really any order at all. They got a little
   jumbled as they were transferred. First recorded in Marion Stokes’s
   home in the Barclay Condominiums in Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia,
   the tapes had been distributed among nine additional apartments she
   purchased solely for storage purposes during her life. Later, they
   passed on to her children, into storage, and finally to the
   California-based archive. Although no one knew it at the time, the
   recordings Stokes made from 1975 until her death in 2012 are the only
   comprehensive collection preserving this period in television media
   history.

   In 1975, Stokes got a Betamax magnetic videotape recorder and began
   recording bits of sitcoms, science documentaries, and political news
   coverage. From the outset of the Iran Hostage Crisis on November 4,
   1979, “she hit record and she never stopped,” said her son Michael
   Metelits in Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project, a newly released
   documentary about his mother and the archival project that became her
   life’s work.

   “She was interested in access to information, documenting media, making
   sure people had the information they needed to make good decisions,”
   says the film’s director, Matt Wolf.

   The year 1980 brought the launch of CNN, and the 24-hour news cycle.
   Soon, three, four, five, and sometimes as many as eight tapes were
   spinning away at once in Stokes’s apartment, recording news broadcasts,
   commercials, and everything in between on multiple networks. While many
   people assumed that television networks held on to everything they
   aired, that wasn’t the case. Studios were constantly erasing and
   recycling broadcast tapes in order to save money and free up storage
   space.

     “We’d be out at dinner and we’d have to rush home to swap tapes.”

   Stokes was no stranger to television and its role in molding public
   opinion. An activist archivist, she had been a librarian with the Free
   Library of Philadelphia for nearly 20 years before being fired in the
   early 1960s, likely for her work as a Communist party organizer. From
   1968 to 1971, she had co-produced Input, a Sunday-morning talk show
   airing on the local Philadelphia CBS affiliate, with John S. Stokes
   Jr., who would later become her husband. Input brought together
   academics, community and religious leaders, activists, scientists, and
   artists to openly discuss social justice issues and other topics of the
   day.

   “Our vision is really aligned with Marion’s,” says Roger Macdonald,
   director of the television archives at the Internet Archive. “It’s
   really bold and ambitious: universal access to all knowledge.” Marion’s
   son had contacted the Internet Archive when he was trying to find a
   home for her tapes in 2013. Macdonald immediately seized the
   opportunity. Within 20 minutes, the two were on the phone.

   Macdonald recalls asking Metelits, “How could you physically manage
   taping all this stuff? And he said, ‘Well, we’d be out at dinner and
   we’d have to rush home to swap tapes’ … that was one of the cycles of
   their lives, tape swapping.”

   In addition to her son Michael and her husband, Stokes’s nurse,
   secretary, driver, and step-children were enlisted to assist in her
   around-the-clock task of capturing every moment on television. She
   would also involve them in active conversations, asking those around
   her what they thought about how the issues of the day were being
   handled on broadcast television.
   "Watch whatever, whenever," declares a Betamax advertisement from 1978.
   And that's just what Marion Stokes has made possible. “Watch whatever,
   whenever,” declares a Betamax advertisement from 1978. And that’s just
   what Marion Stokes has made possible. Nesster

   Having been surveilled by the government for her early political
   activism––she and her first husband, Melvin Metelits, had attempted to
   defect to Cuba together before splitting up––Stokes was exceedingly
   cautious about her recordings while she was alive. She eschewed Tivo,
   and although she was an early and evangelical investor in Apple Inc.,
   she never sent an email in her life. She even managed to convince the
   rest of the already-wealthy Stokes clan to buy Apple stock, which paid
   off in spades. She funneled these funds into her recording project and
   the massive storage space she required as the sole force behind it.

   “She’s already excluded from power and established institutions, so it
   makes sense that she’d want to pursue her life’s work privately,” says
   Wolf.

   Now, Stokes’s work will be made publicly available on the Internet
   Archives, bit by bit, offering everyone the opportunity to examine
   history––and perhaps to set the record straight.
