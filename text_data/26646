Rapid Evolution Changes Species in Real Time

Some species are evolving far more quickly than Darwin ever imagined.

   By Jane Braxton Little|Thursday, January 22, 2015
   RELATED TAGS: EVOLUTION

   As a graduate student in the late 1970s, David Reznick set out on a
   modest quest to test a key part of the theory of evolution. Reznick
   wanted to examine Charles Darwin’s concept of the struggle for
   existence — specifically, how predator-prey interactions shape the
   evolution of new species. Enthusiastic and ambitious, he intended to do
   it in the wild. “I wanted to watch evolution happen,” says Reznick, now
   an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside.
   So in 1978, he flew to Trinidad in search of guppies. Armed with a
   topographic map traced onto a piece of notebook paper, he headed into
   the Caribbean island’s rugged Northern Range. Working under a canopy of
   tropical trees amid squawking birds, multicolored butterflies and boas,
   he collected 1,600 guppies, a colorful fish species so prolific that
   the females can produce dozens of babies every three to four weeks.
   Reznick was curious to see if predators could affect genetic adaptation
   in guppies over a short time.
   It was not considered a promising experiment. A century earlier, Darwin
   had assumed that evolution takes tens to hundreds of thousands of
   generations to produce new species — a plodding path so slow it is
   essentially invisible. That theory still held sway when Reznick began
   grad school in 1974. Scientists had studied evolution in controlled
   laboratory experiments, but watching it happen in a natural setting in
   a human lifetime was considered improbable at best, more likely
   impossible.
   Guppies

   Reznick’s study of Trinidad guppies revealed that the fish can evolve
   rapidly.
   Paul Bentzen/Dalhousie University
   “I was hanging my career on the idea that you could change the
   environment and see things evolve significantly in time to get tenure,”
   Reznick says. “People thought my thesis was cute, but doubted I would
   live long enough to see the results.”
   Undaunted, in 1981 Reznick returned to Trinidad’s swift streams to test
   his theory. He transplanted guppies from a site where they had to fend
   off cichlids, an aggressive, wide-mouthed fish, to a new site with no
   predators and no other guppies. Reznick also introduced cichlids to
   guppy sites without predators.
   He found that within four years — a mere six to eight generations —
   male guppies had significantly changed their reproductive patterns.
   Those transplanted from a high-predation site to a stream without
   predators were larger, matured later and reproduced more slowly. Where
   Reznick had introduced predators, the guppies adapted by maturing at an
   earlier age. Survival became a race to produce more babies.
   “The risk of death alters the ways organisms allocate resources for
   survival,” Reznick says.
   The results of his federally funded study prompted what he calls one of
   his proudest moments in science: a National Enquirer story with the
   headline, “Uncle Sam wastes $97,000 to learn how old guppies are when
   they die.” Actually, Reznick chuckles, “I learned a great deal more
   than that.” His work with the guppies changed his thinking about how
   quickly species can evolve. And it helped launch a paradigm shift in
   scientists’ thinking about evolution.
   In the decades since Reznick’s first trip to Trinidad, other studies
   have demonstrated a fast drive toward adaptation that scientists have
   come to call “rapid evolution.” Researchers who once assumed evolution
   required millennia are documenting species adapting in mere decades, or
   even shorter time frames. Mosquitoes that colonized the London
   Underground in 1863 are now so different they can no longer mate with
   their above-ground relatives. Chinook salmon from Alaska to California
   needed just a human generation to become smaller and shorter-lived
   after an increase in commercial fishing in the 1920s. Adaptation is
   happening right under our noses, in our lifetimes.
   Lizard

   Green anole lizards adapt to the invasion of brown anoles in only 20
   generations.
   Seth Patterson/Nature Picture Library
   Most recently, evolutionary biologist Yoel Stuart found that green
   anole lizards on islands in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon needed just
   20 generations to adapt to an invasion of brown anoles. Driven to
   higher perches by the invaders, the green anoles became better at
   clinging to branches by developing larger toepads with more scales — in
   just 15 years. It’s more evidence of “evolutionary change on observable
   time scales,” says Stuart, now at the University of Texas at Austin.
   Many of the extraordinary adaptations happening around us may be
   because of us. As human activity disrupts climate patterns and modifies
   habitats, rapid evolution appears to be an increasingly common strategy
   for survival.
   The effect of warming temperatures on tawny owls is one of the first
   documented examples of adaptation to climate change in a wild
   population. Finnish ornithologist Patrik Karell and others found in a
   2011 study that the coloration of the owls morphed in response to
   warming winters in Finland.
   Tawny owls come in two colors, pale gray and reddish brown. Until
   recently, natural selection favored the pale shade, which gave owls a
   better chance at survival in a snowy landscape. As winters became
   milder, Karell noticed a steady increase in the proportion of
   reddish-brown owls.
   “Even subtle alterations shape how organisms evolve,” Reznick says.
   Species are evolving at speeds that Darwin could not have imagined. But
   not all species can adapt quickly enough to evade harm. When a
   non-native species arrives in an ecosystem, the native species often
   are ill-equipped to defend against the foreign invader. Ash trees in
   North America, for example, lacked “evolutionary accommodations” to
   protect against the emerald ash borer when it arrived from Asia,
   Reznick says. As a result, tens of millions of ash trees across the
   continent are threatened by the green beetle, which is thought to have
   hitchhiked to the U.S. in wood crating or pallets.
   Today’s evolutionary biologists have the analytic power to track
   species adaptation like never before. Advances in molecular biology
   allow them to identify the very genes that help individuals move away
   from their ancestors as they adapt to new conditions. For example, a
   team of scientists at Harvard Medical School and Princeton identified
   BMP4 as the key gene that sculpts the beaks of the Galapagos finches
   that gave Darwin his first inklings of the theory of evolution.
   “We are no longer forced to infer evolution from its historical
   footprints in the fossil record or from dusty collections of moths,”
   Reznick says.

   Reznick and his team continue to transplant guppies in the tropical
   streams of Trinidad. Along with other new tools of evolutionary
   biology, such as DNA analysis, they are using a technique Reznick
   developed to mark individual guppies so they can more easily recapture
   them later. This marking method allows his team to reconstruct the
   pedigree of individual guppies and measure their reproductive success.
   The research is answering questions about how predator-prey
   interactions shape evolving species, but it has also generated new
   questions: If environmental forces can change guppies, could the
   guppies themselves also change their ecosystems? Intrigued, Reznick has
   turned his attention to how ecological and evolutionary processes
   interact.
   Now he’s not only monitoring guppies; he’s also watching their
   predators to see how the interaction changes the ecosystem. His team
   wants to know how guppies adapt to predators as well as how predators
   evolve in response to guppies — the ecological cause-and-effect
   relationships.
   “What hardly anyone’s thinking about is that the animals and plants
   left behind may have evolved and are different from what they were
   before predators were eliminated,” Reznick says. This raises
   fundamental questions about ecological restoration, invasive species,
   natural selection and what else changes when the fittest actually
   survive.
   Documenting the rapid evolution of species in natural settings turns
   Darwin’s “mystery of mysteries” into a real-time scientific adventure.
   And while Reznick has succeeded in watching evolution happen, he’s
   beginning to think his earlier calculations underestimated how quickly
   species actually adapt in nature. “What’s exciting,” says Reznick, “is
   that it is now feasible to incorporate evolution into our thinking
   about how the world is changing.”

Rapid Evolution Changes Species in Real Time

Some species are evolving far more quickly than Darwin ever imagined.

   By Jane Braxton Little|Thursday, January 22, 2015
   RELATED TAGS: EVOLUTION

   Biologist David Reznick examines a few of his lab subjects.

   As a graduate student in the late 1970s, David Reznick set out on a
   modest quest to test a key part of the theory of evolution. Reznick
   wanted to examine Charles Darwin’s concept of the struggle for
   existence — specifically, how predator-prey interactions shape the
   evolution of new species. Enthusiastic and ambitious, he intended to do
   it in the wild. “I wanted to watch evolution happen,” says Reznick, now
   an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside.
   So in 1978, he flew to Trinidad in search of guppies. Armed with a
   topographic map traced onto a piece of notebook paper, he headed into
   the Caribbean island’s rugged Northern Range. Working under a canopy of
   tropical trees amid squawking birds, multicolored butterflies and boas,
   he collected 1,600 guppies, a colorful fish species so prolific that
   the females can produce dozens of babies every three to four weeks.
   Reznick was curious to see if predators could affect genetic adaptation
   in guppies over a short time.
   It was not considered a promising experiment. A century earlier, Darwin
   had assumed that evolution takes tens to hundreds of thousands of
   generations to produce new species — a plodding path so slow it is
   essentially invisible. That theory still held sway when Reznick began
   grad school in 1974. Scientists had studied evolution in controlled
   laboratory experiments, but watching it happen in a natural setting in
   a human lifetime was considered improbable at best, more likely
   impossible.

   Reznick’s study of Trinidad guppies revealed that the fish can evolve
   rapidly.
   Paul Bentzen/Dalhousie University
   “I was hanging my career on the idea that you could change the
   environment and see things evolve significantly in time to get tenure,”
   Reznick says. “People thought my thesis was cute, but doubted I would
   live long enough to see the results.”
   Undaunted, in 1981 Reznick returned to Trinidad’s swift streams to test
   his theory. He transplanted guppies from a site where they had to fend
   off cichlids, an aggressive, wide-mouthed fish, to a new site with no
   predators and no other guppies. Reznick also introduced cichlids to
   guppy sites without predators.
   He found that within four years — a mere six to eight generations —
   male guppies had significantly changed their reproductive patterns.
   Those transplanted from a high-predation site to a stream without
   predators were larger, matured later and reproduced more slowly. Where
   Reznick had introduced predators, the guppies adapted by maturing at an
   earlier age. Survival became a race to produce more babies.
   “The risk of death alters the ways organisms allocate resources for
   survival,” Reznick says.
   The results of his federally funded study prompted what he calls one of
   his proudest moments in science: a National Enquirer story with the
   headline, “Uncle Sam wastes $97,000 to learn how old guppies are when
   they die.” Actually, Reznick chuckles, “I learned a great deal more
   than that.” His work with the guppies changed his thinking about how
   quickly species can evolve. And it helped launch a paradigm shift in
   scientists’ thinking about evolution.
   In the decades since Reznick’s first trip to Trinidad, other studies
   have demonstrated a fast drive toward adaptation that scientists have
   come to call “rapid evolution.” Researchers who once assumed evolution
   required millennia are documenting species adapting in mere decades, or
   even shorter time frames. Mosquitoes that colonized the London
   Underground in 1863 are now so different they can no longer mate with
   their above-ground relatives. Chinook salmon from Alaska to California
   needed just a human generation to become smaller and shorter-lived
   after an increase in commercial fishing in the 1920s. Adaptation is
   happening right under our noses, in our lifetimes.
   Lizard

   Green anole lizards adapt to the invasion of brown anoles in only 20
   generations.
   Seth Patterson/Nature Picture Library
   Most recently, evolutionary biologist Yoel Stuart found that green
   anole lizards on islands in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon needed just
   20 generations to adapt to an invasion of brown anoles. Driven to
   higher perches by the invaders, the green anoles became better at
   clinging to branches by developing larger toepads with more scales — in
   just 15 years. It’s more evidence of “evolutionary change on observable
   time scales,” says Stuart, now at the University of Texas at Austin.
   Many of the extraordinary adaptations happening around us may be
   because of us. As human activity disrupts climate patterns and modifies
   habitats, rapid evolution appears to be an increasingly common strategy
   for survival.
   The effect of warming temperatures on tawny owls is one of the first
   documented examples of adaptation to climate change in a wild
   population. Finnish ornithologist Patrik Karell and others found in a
   2011 study that the coloration of the owls morphed in response to
   warming winters in Finland.
   Tawny owls come in two colors, pale gray and reddish brown. Until
   recently, natural selection favored the pale shade, which gave owls a
   better chance at survival in a snowy landscape. As winters became
   milder, Karell noticed a steady increase in the proportion of
   reddish-brown owls.
   “Even subtle alterations shape how organisms evolve,” Reznick says.
   Species are evolving at speeds that Darwin could not have imagined. But
   not all species can adapt quickly enough to evade harm. When a
   non-native species arrives in an ecosystem, the native species often
   are ill-equipped to defend against the foreign invader. Ash trees in
   North America, for example, lacked “evolutionary accommodations” to
   protect against the emerald ash borer when it arrived from Asia,
   Reznick says. As a result, tens of millions of ash trees across the
   continent are threatened by the green beetle, which is thought to have
   hitchhiked to the U.S. in wood crating or pallets.
   Today’s evolutionary biologists have the analytic power to track
   species adaptation like never before. Advances in molecular biology
   allow them to identify the very genes that help individuals move away
   from their ancestors as they adapt to new conditions. For example, a
   team of scientists at Harvard Medical School and Princeton identified
   BMP4 as the key gene that sculpts the beaks of the Galapagos finches
   that gave Darwin his first inklings of the theory of evolution.
   “We are no longer forced to infer evolution from its historical
   footprints in the fossil record or from dusty collections of moths,”
   Reznick says.

   Reznick and his team continue to transplant guppies in the tropical
   streams of Trinidad. Along with other new tools of evolutionary
   biology, such as DNA analysis, they are using a technique Reznick
   developed to mark individual guppies so they can more easily recapture
   them later. This marking method allows his team to reconstruct the
   pedigree of individual guppies and measure their reproductive success.
   The research is answering questions about how predator-prey
   interactions shape evolving species, but it has also generated new
   questions: If environmental forces can change guppies, could the
   guppies themselves also change their ecosystems? Intrigued, Reznick has
   turned his attention to how ecological and evolutionary processes
   interact.
   Now he’s not only monitoring guppies; he’s also watching their
   predators to see how the interaction changes the ecosystem. His team
   wants to know how guppies adapt to predators as well as how predators
   evolve in response to guppies — the ecological cause-and-effect
   relationships.
   “What hardly anyone’s thinking about is that the animals and plants
   left behind may have evolved and are different from what they were
   before predators were eliminated,” Reznick says. This raises
   fundamental questions about ecological restoration, invasive species,
   natural selection and what else changes when the fittest actually
   survive.
   Documenting the rapid evolution of species in natural settings turns
   Darwin’s “mystery of mysteries” into a real-time scientific adventure.
   And while Reznick has succeeded in watching evolution happen, he’s
   beginning to think his earlier calculations underestimated how quickly
   species actually adapt in nature. “What’s exciting,” says Reznick, “is
   that it is now feasible to incorporate evolution into our thinking
   about how the world is changing.”
