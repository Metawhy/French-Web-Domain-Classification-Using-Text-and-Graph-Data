Significance

   Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes has treated
   disease in humans. However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to
   nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number
   of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a
   high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA
   that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how
   >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two
   LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs
   codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to
   endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles
   that target new cells.

Abstract

   Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type.
   Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains
   challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method
   to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in
   vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how
   >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into
   functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how
   >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified
   7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA
   (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes,
   distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to
   hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that
   FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.

   A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA therapy targeted to hepatocytes (1, 2)
   has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This
   advance is exciting, but its long-term implications are tempered by the
   fact that clinical LNP therapies have targeted hepatocytes (when
   administered systemically) (1, 3) and muscle (when administered
   locally) (4). In mice, nanoparticles have delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   ribonucleoproteins via systemic or local injection (5⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–12).
   Systemically administered Cas9 delivery to nonliver tissues remains a
   challenge. When LNPs are administered systemically, they display an
   affinity for the liver; this is thought to be driven by natural
   physiological advantages including slow blood flow (13, 14) and
   discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids (15). One additional
   reason most LNPs target the liver may be the process by which they are
   selected. LNPs are screened in vitro before a few LNPs are tested in
   vivo. In vitro LNP delivery can predict in vivo LNP delivery to
   hepatocytes (16), but in vitro nanoparticle can be a poor predictor of
   in vivo delivery to endothelial cells and macrophages (17). Moreover,
   LNP siRNA delivery is often tested in vivo using the FVII assay, which
   predicts hepatocyte delivery; this assay is enhanced by its ease, as
   well as the fact that validated, potent siRNA targeting FVII is
   available (18, 19). It is possible that LNPs target hepatocytes in part
   because established assays select for hepatocyte delivery.

   We reasoned that measuring hundreds of distinct LNPs in vivo would
   provide the best chance of identifying nanoparticles that deliver mRNA
   to new cell types. Using DNA barcodes (17, 20⇓–22), we previously
   quantified how >350 LNPs distributed in vivo. However, biodistribution
   is necessary, but not sufficient, for functional RNA delivery. Over 96%
   of RNA delivered into the endosome of a target cell can be degraded
   (23, 24), and cell-type-specific changes in endosomal escape are not
   understood (25). Thus, it is difficult to predict functional delivery
   using biodistribution. As a result, a high-throughput method to
   quantify functional, cytosolic delivery of mRNA in vivo could
   accelerate the discovery of clinically relevant LNPs.

   An ideal system would (i) enable scientists to test many LNPs
   simultaneously, (ii) utilize commonly available animal models, (iii)
   rely on a robust signal, and (iv) measure functional RNA delivery to
   any combinations of cell types in vivo. Measuring delivery to
   “on-target” cells and “off-target” cells would enable iterative screens
   to improve LNP specificity. We designed a system named Fast
   Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) that meets these
   criteria. FIND measures cytosolic mRNA delivery by >100 LNPs in vivo to
   any combination of cell types. We quantified how >250 LNPs functionally
   delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified two
   formulations that deliver RNA to endothelial beds. FIND is a system
   that facilitates high-throughput screens of functional mRNA delivery
   and may identify LNPs with novel tropisms.

Results

   FIND combined rationally designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox system
   to generate a multiplexed readout of functional mRNA delivery. FIND is
   distinct from previous barcoding systems we developed, which measure
   biodistribution (Fig. 1A). Using high-throughput microfluidics (26), we
   coformulated LNPs with Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. LNP-1, with
   chemical structure 1, carried DNA barcode 1 and Cre mRNA; LNP-N, with
   chemical structure N, carried DNA barcode N and Cre mRNA (Fig. 1 A–C).
   We characterized the size and stability of each LNP using dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and discarded LNPs that did not meet two criteria: (i)
   diameters between 20 and 200 nm and (ii) an autocorrelation curve with
   one inflection point (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). LNPs that met these
   criteria were pooled together and administered to Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato
   (Ai14) mice (27). Ai14 cells fluoresce if Cre mRNA is translated into
   Cre protein, which then translocates to the nucleus and edits target
   DNA. We isolated tdTomato^+ cells with FACS and deep-sequenced the
   cells to identify LNPs that delivered mRNA. We reasoned the codelivery
   of mRNA and a 56-nt ssDNA could approximate the codelivery of an mRNA
   encoding a nuclease and guide RNA (28⇓–30). After sequencing tdTomato^+
   cells (Fig. 1C), we ranked LNPs by calculating the “normalized
   delivery” of each barcode. Normalized delivery is analogous to counts
   per million in RNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
   We used barcodes we previously described and validated with a number of
   control experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C–E) (17, 20, 21).

   FIND is a high-throughput screen for functional mRNA delivery. (A)
   Unlike previous biodistribution screens, which cannot distinguish
   between bound particles, particles stuck in endosomes, and particles
   that delivered RNA into the cytoplasm, FIND identifies LNPs that
   functionally deliver RNA. (B and C) Nanoparticles were formulated to
   carry Cre mRNA and a DNA barcode, before they were administered to Cre
   reporter cell lines or mice. Cells that underwent Cre-mediated genetic
   changes were isolated using FACS, and the DNA barcode was sequenced to
   identify the LNP that delivered the mRNA. (D) LNP barcodes were ranked
   by “normalized delivery”; each sample (e.g., lung 1 vs. heart 1) was
   analyzed individually on a single sequencing run. Using these data, we
   would hypothesize that LNP-1 delivered nucleic acids more efficiently
   to the lungs than LNP-2 and LNP-N. (E) LGSL-R cells were treated with
   naked Cre mRNA or Cre mRNA carrried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K). RFP
   expression indicates cytoplasmic Cre mRNA delivery. (F) Alexa 647 and
   RFP intensities after treatment with L2K carrying Cre mRNA and Alexa
   647-labeled DNA barcode. Compared with untreated cells, there are no
   Alexa 647-RFP+ cells, demonstrating that biodistribution is necessary,
   but not sufficient, for cytoplasmic delivery. (G) RFP+ HEK cells as a
   function of the administered Cre mRNA, which was delivered with L2K.
   (H) Normalized DNA barcode delivery for 54 LNPs sequenced from RFP+ HEK
   cells after the administration of 10 ng or 100 ng total mRNA. A high
   degree of correlation between samples suggests that LNPs which deliver
   mRNA at the first dose deliver mRNA at the second dose. (I) RFP+ HEK
   cells following the administration of 54 LNPs (100 ng total mRNA),
   after cells were treated with endocytosis inhibitors. n = 3–4 wells per
   group. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.

   We characterized FIND using in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, we
   cultured HEK.293 cells that expressed LoxP-GFP-Stop-LoxP-RFP (LGSL-RFP)
   under a CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). These cells became RFP^+ 72 h after
   treatment with Cre mRNA carried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K), but not
   with naked Cre mRNA, which served as the negative control (Fig. 1E and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S1F). The number of RFP^+ cells after L2K treatment
   increased with dose and time, up to 3 d (SI Appendix, Fig. S1G). We
   then coformulated L2K with Cre mRNA and an Alexa 647-labeled DNA
   barcode. After 24 h, 62, 36, 2, and 0% of the cells were 647^+RFP^−,
   647^+RFP^+, 647^−RFP^−, and 647^−RFP^+, respectively. This indicates
   that biodistribution is required, but not sufficient for functional
   cytosolic delivery, as we expected (Fig. 1F). Untreated cells—used to
   control for autofluorescence—were 647^−RFP^− (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix,
   Fig. S1H).

   We then formulated 54 chemically distinct LNPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 I
   and J) carrying Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. We administered the
   LNPs to LGSL-RFP cells with mRNA doses of 10, 100, or 1,000 ng and an
   mRNA:DNA barcode mass ratio of 10:1. We observed a dose-dependent
   increase in RFP^+ cells, with over 80% of the cells RFP^+ 3 d after the
   1,000-ng transfection (Fig. 1G). We sequenced barcodes at all three
   doses, reasoning that barcode delivery at the lowest dose (4% RFP^+
   cells) would predict delivery at the middle dose (20% RFP^+ cells); we
   observed a strong correlation (R^2 > 0.9) between normalized delivery
   at 10-ng and 100-ng doses, suggesting this was the case (Fig. 1H). As a
   control, we sequenced cells treated with 1,000 ng mRNA; in this case,
   the system was saturated (>80% of the cells were RFP^+). As expected,
   the correlation between 1,000 ng and either 10 or 100 ng was weaker (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S1K) than the correlation between the two lower doses;
   importantly, these data indicate that FIND can become saturated as the
   percent of RFP^+ increases. Therefore, varying the dose by the potency
   of the nanoparticles pooled may be critical. We then evaluated whether
   the number of RFP^+ cells decreased after pretreatment with
   chlorpromazine, genistein, or ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), which
   inhibit clathrin-, caveolin-, and macropinocytosis-mediated
   endocytosis, respectively. Compared with control cells that were not
   treated with inhibitors, RFP^+ cells decreased by 40–60%,
   recapitulating results previously obtained with individual LNPs (24,
   31) (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
   FIND could analyze mRNA delivery in vitro.

   We investigated whether FIND could identify nanoparticles that deliver
   mRNA in vivo (Fig. 2 A and B). We formulated 112 LNPs, varying four
   chemical traits that influence LNP delivery in vitro: the lipid-amine
   compound, the molar amount of PEG, the structure of PEG, and the molar
   amount of cholesterol (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).
   Seventy-one LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion and were pooled
   (Fig. 2D). Naked DNA barcode, which should not be delivered as
   efficiently as DNA barcodes in LNPs, was included as a negative
   control. We i.v. injected the pooled LNPs and naked barcode into Ai14
   mice at a 1.5 mg/kg total mRNA dose (average dose 0.021 mg/kg per
   particle). Three days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ lung and kidney
   endothelial cells (tdTomato^+CD31^+CD45^−). Separately, we injected 1.0
   mg/kg total mRNA into mice intramuscularly and isolated immune
   (tdTomato^+CD45^+) and nonimmune (tdTomato^+CD45^−) cells from muscle.
   We gated on PBS-injected Ai14 mice for i.v. injected mice and the
   contralateral limb for intramuscular administration. It was important
   to gate on untreated Ai14 mice instead of C57BL/6J mice; gating on
   C57BL/6J mice could lead to inflated values of tdTomato^+ cells (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2C). Separately, we administered the same LNPs to
   LGSL-RFP cells in vitro. Several lines of evidence suggested the data
   were robust. In all routes of administration, the naked barcode was
   delivered less efficiently than every LNP (Fig. 2E). Second, 7C1-based
   LNPs, which we previously optimized for in vivo RNA delivery (32), were
   enriched in the top 20% LNPs, compared with the other six lipid-amine
   compounds. (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and E). Finally, we reasoned that
   the route of administration would affect delivery; Euclidean
   clustering, a common bioinformatics technique (33) that compares how
   similar/dissimilar groups are to one another, and can be used to study
   nanoparticles in vivo (17, 20), separated intravenous, intramuscular,
   and in vitro delivery into three distinct clusters, as expected (Fig.
   2F).

   FIND can quantify LNP delivery in vivo. (A) Cre recombinase leads to
   the deletion of a stop codon allowing for the expression of tdTomato
   driven by a CAG promoter. (B) Libraries of LNPs containing Cre mRNA and
   DNA barcodes are administered to LSL-tdTom (Ai14) mice. tdTomato+ cells
   are isolated by FACS and DNA barcodes are sequenced. (C) Screen 1
   consisted of a library of 112 distinct LNPs created by formulating
   seven compounds with cholesterol, DOPE, and C14-PEG2000 at 16 different
   mole ratios. (D) DLS analysis of all 112 LNPs from this library; 71
   formed stable LNPs and were included. (E) Normalized DNA delivery in
   kidney and lung endothelial cells (CD31+CD45−) after LNPs were i.v.
   injected, as well as CD45+ and CD45− cells isolated following
   intramuscular injection. (F) In vivo LNP targeting heat map generated
   by unbiased, Euclidean clustering. In vitro LNP delivery, in vivo
   intramuscular delivery, and in vivo i.v. delivery cluster separately,
   as expected.

   We formulated a second LNP library to study how PEG, cholesterol, and
   helper lipids [e.g., dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)] influence
   delivery to cells in vivo. We focused on 7C1-based LNPs, since 7C1 was
   enriched in the first screen. We varied the PEG molar amount, as well
   as the alkyl length on the PEG-lipid (SI Appendix, Fig. S2F).
   Seventy-eight out of 108 LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion; we
   i.v. administered the pool to the mice at a total mRNA dose of 1.5
   mg/kg. Three days later, we sequenced barcodes from tdTomato^+ lung and
   kidney endothelial cells. LNPs containing C[14] alkyl PEG were enriched
   in lung endothelial cells, whereas LNPs containing C[18] alkyl PEG were
   enriched in kidney endothelial cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 G and H). To
   validate the relationship between lung delivery, kidney delivery, and
   PEG structure, we formulated a third LNP library. We formulated 158
   LNPs designed to improve lung delivery relative to kidney delivery by
   only using C[14] alkyl-tail PEG varying helper lipid composition (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2I). We found 3.75 times more lung endothelial cells
   were tdTomato^+ than kidney endothelial cells, a ratio that was
   significantly higher than the second screen (SI Appendix, Fig. S2J), as
   expected. Consistent with previous results (17, 20), we did not observe
   a relationship between LNP size and delivery to endothelial cells
   between the range of 20–200 nm (SI Appendix, Fig. S2K). The poor
   performance of the naked barcode, enrichment of 7C1, the fact that
   unbiased clustering separated the three routes of administration, and
   the PEG data convinced us FIND was capable of quantifying delivery in
   vivo.

   After completing these in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, we
   selected two LNPs (named 7C2 and 7C3) for more thorough
   characterization (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). The
   7C2 was formulated with 7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:18:1 Lyso PC at a
   molar ratio of 50:23.5:6.5:20. The 7C3 was formulated with
   7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:DOPE at a molar ratio of 60:10:25:5. The
   7C2 and 7C3 formed stable LNPs with average diameters between 50 and 80
   nm when formulated with siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), or mRNA (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D). The in vitro endocytosis and functional Cre
   mRNA delivery of both LNPs in LGSL-RFP cells decreased by at least 40%
   when cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine and genistein, relative
   to cells that were not treated with inhibitors. EIPA impacted LNP
   uptake but did not significantly decrease functional delivery in vitro
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H). These results suggest 7C2 and 7C3 are
   endocytosed in vitro via several pathways. To study biodistribution,
   7C2 and 7C3 were formulated with a Cy5.5-conjugated DNA barcode and
   i.v. injected into separate mice at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg DNA. Three
   hours later—a time point that is sufficiently long for LNPs to be
   cleared from the blood (34)—Cy5.5 ex vivo fluorescence, normalized by
   tissue weight, was highest in the spleen, kidney, and liver, suggesting
   7C2 and 7C3 distributed to these tissues (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig.
   S3I).

   Characterization of lead nanoparticles discovered by FIND. (A) The top
   two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, discovered following three rounds of FIND
   are characterized by measuring biodistribution, delivery of siRNA,
   sgRNA. (B) The 7C2 and 7C3 were composed of 7C1 compound, cholesterol,
   C14-PEG2000, and helper lipids, 18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE, respectively.
   (C) Following a 0.75-mg/kg Barcode-Cy5.5 administration,
   biodistribution of 7C2 and 7C3 was quantified and normalized to tissue
   weight. n = 4 miceper group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-way ANOVA. (D)
   Following a 1-mg/kg siICAM2 administration, both 7C2 and 7C3 induced
   ICAM2 protein silencing in endothelial cells by flow cytometry. The 7C2
   demonstrates more robust protein silencing in lung endothelial cells
   than 7C3. n = 4 mice per group. **P < 0.01, two tailed t test. (E–G)
   Following repeat administration of 7C2 and 7C3 at 1.5 mg/kg sgICAM2a
   and sgICAM2b, ICAM2 (E) protein and (F and G) indels were measured in
   endothelial cells isolated from multiple organs using FACS. n = 3–4
   mice per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test.

   We tested whether 7C2 and 7C3 functionally delivered siRNA, sgRNA, and
   mRNA, which are all clinically relevant. We performed our individual
   LNP proof-of-concept experiments with nucleic acids targeting ICAM-2.
   We chose this target for three reasons. First, ICAM-2 is related to a
   number of inflammatory diseases (35, 36). Second, ICAM-2 expression is
   robust on endothelial cells. Third, there is a well-validated
   monoclonal antibody to ICAM-2, which allows us to quantify protein
   expression robustly using FACS.

   First, we formulated the LNPs to carry siRNA targeting ICAM-2. Three
   days after i.v. injecting mice with PBS, 2.0 mg/kg siGFP (a higher dose
   was used to test tolerability), or 1.0 mg/kg siICAM-2, we quantified
   ICAM-2 protein mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in lung, kidney, and
   splenic endothelial cells using flow cytometry (32, 37). Both siRNAs
   were previously validated and chemically modified to reduce
   immunostimulation and promote on-target mRNA degradation (32, 37) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3J). ICAM-2 MFI was constant in PBS- and siGFP-treated
   mice but decreased by 60% in lung endothelial cells isolated from mice
   injected with siICAM-2. The 7C2-mediated delivery of siRNA reduced
   ICAM-2 expression in lung endothelial cells more than in splenic
   endothelial cells, whereas 7C3 silencing was more robust in splenic
   endothelial cells (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3K). Compared with
   PBS-treated mice, mice injected with 2.0 mg/kg siGFP did not show any
   weight loss or changes in organ weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 L–N).

   We then quantified 7C2- and 7C3-mediated sgRNA delivery. We
   coformulated two sgRNAs that were chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′
   termini (38) and injected each at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg into mice that
   constitutively express SpCas9 (39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3O). After three
   injections, ICAM-2 MFI decreased by up to 90, 75, and 59% in lung,
   spleen, and kidney endothelial cells, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3E).
   To confirm protein silencing was mediated by gene editing, we measured
   (40) ICAM-2 insertions and deletions (indels) in lung, spleen, and
   kidney endothelial cells and found between 30 and 70% editing per
   locus, leading to overall ICAM-2 indel percentages of 135, 95, and 123%
   indel, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 P
   and Q). In these experiments, we utilized two sgRNAs per gene; thus,
   the total indel percentage was 200% (100% per site). Compared with PBS
   mice, mice treated with LNPs did not lose weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3
   R and S). Based on these experiments, we concluded that 7C2 potently
   delivered small RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells in vivo.

   In our siRNA and sgRNA experiments, 7C2 outperformed 7C3 and potently
   delivered RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells. We then investigated
   whether the same observations were true for the delivery of large RNAs
   (mRNA). We formulated 7C2 and 7C3 to carry Cre mRNA and injected the
   LNPs into separate mice at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg mRNA (Fig. 4A). Three
   days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ immune cells and endothelial cells
   from the spleen, kidney, heart, lung, and liver, as well as
   hepatocytes. We made two interesting observations. First, contrasting
   the small RNA delivery experiments, 7C3 outperformed 7C2. Second,
   splenic endothelial cells were targeted efficiently (Fig. 4B). Notably,
   relative to splenic endothelial cells, very few immune cells and
   hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 T and U). Given this
   degree of specificity has not been reported to date, we repeated the
   experiment using 34 Ai14 mice over the course of several months. The
   7C3 delivered Cre mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in every experiment
   (Fig. 4C). However, we did observe batch-to-batch variability with
   respect to hepatocyte targeting (Fig. 4 C and D). In 22 of the 34 mice,
   a low percentage of hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (<13%); in 12 of the 34
   mice, we observed high percentages of tdTomato^+ cells. Averaging data
   from all 34 mice, the number of tdTomato^+ splenic endothelial cells
   (43%) was 2.2 times higher than the number of tdTomato^+ hepatocytes
   (20%) (Fig. 4D). Splenic endothelial cell delivery was also
   dose-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3V). The variable delivery to
   hepatocytes was unlikely to be driven by toxicity; throughout our
   studies, we injected 34 mice with 7C3 and did not observe changes in
   mouse weight or obvious signs of toxicity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3W). We
   were unable to identify the source of batch variability; however, we
   hypothesize it is driven by the polymeric backbone of 7C3 and the
   resulting heterogenous chemical structure. Our data strongly suggest
   that future FIND screens should focus on compounds with defined
   chemical structures, which may be less likely to exhibit biological
   heterogeneity. The data also demonstrate that 7C3 can efficiently
   deliver mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, the 7C2
   and 7C3 formulations both included the lipomer 7C1 but had variable
   molar compositions of helper lipids (18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE), which
   distinguished them chemically from previously described
   endothelial-targeting nanoparticles. The differences in delivery
   between 7C2 and 7C3 provide interesting preliminary evidence that
   suggests changing the composition of helper lipids added to a given
   ionizable amine can alter tropism. The compositions and efficacy of 7C2
   and 7C3 are included in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.

   (A) The top two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, are characterized by delivery

   eight experiments of tdTomato+ splenic endothelial cells and
   hepatocytes in LSL-Tom mice following a single 1.5-mg/kg injection of
   Cre mRNA delivered by 7C3. n = 34. ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.
   (E) Indel percentage in splenic ECs following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.
   (F) Indel percentage in hepatocytes following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.

   Given the difference between small and large RNA delivery, we
   quantified how LNPs codelivered CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. We
   formulated Cas9 mRNA and two guides targeting ICAM-2 into LNPs at a 3:1
   mass ratio and injected a 2.0 mg/kg total i.v. on day 0 and 2. On day
   7, we isolated endothelial cells from the spleen, lung, kidney, and
   liver, as well as hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Splenic
   endothelial cell editing mediated by 7C3 was more robust than editing
   in hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). Mice injected with 7C2 and 7C3
   did not lose weight, compared with PBS-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S5C). These studies were also conducted with sgRNAs that were
   chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini (38); during the course of
   the experiments, two groups demonstrated that heavily modified sgRNAs
   improved in vivo editing (7, 8). We redesigned sgICAM2b with “enhanced”
   modifications (8) (referred to as e-sgICAM2) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D)
   and formulated 7C3 to carry Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2. Given that
   e-sgICAM2 was more likely to resist degradation in vivo (8), we
   hypothesized that the optimal mass ratio of Cas9 mRNA:sgRNA would
   decrease from 3:1, which is the optimized ratio with minimally
   stablized sgRNAs. To test this, we formulated 7C3 with Cas9
   mRNA:e-sgRNA ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1, keeping the total injected
   dose constant at 2.0 mg/kg. After injecting mice i.v. with 2.0 mg/kg
   total RNA (Cas9 mRNA + sgRNA) on days 0 and 2, we isolated splenic
   endothelial cells and hepatocytes using FACS on day 7. We observed gene
   editing in splenic endothelial cells and hepatocytes at all
   mRNA-to-sgRNA ratios, with an average of 20% editing in the 1:1 mass
   ratio group (Fig. 4 E and F). As expected, the lower Cas9 mRNA:e-sgRNA
   mass ratio led to increased editing. Once again, mice injected with 7C3
   did not lose weight compared with PBS-treated controls (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S5E). This is a demonstration of systemic Cas9-mediated editing of
   endothelial cells in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that
   systemically administered nanoparticles can edit endothelial cells, and
   that the ideal Cas9:sgRNA ratio will depend on the relative stability
   of the two molecules.

Discussion

   FIND is a high-throughput method to quantify functional mRNA delivery
   mediated by LNPs. The distinction between biodistribution and
   functional delivery is significant; >96% of delivered RNA does not
   escape the endosome (23, 24), and endosomal escape may vary with cell
   type or disease state (41), making it hard to predict functional
   delivery using biodistribution. Notably, Cre mRNA must be translated in
   the cytoplasm, translocate into the nucleus, and edit target DNA. The
   similarity between these steps and the steps required for
   nuclease-mediated gene editing is one reason we selected a Cre-based
   FIND system. We also chose the Cre-lox system because Ai14 mice are
   well-validated and commonly available (27). Moreover, the Cre-mediated
   signal is strong and does not vary dramatically with time; by contrast,
   a GFP-based system would have a signal that varies hour by hour, making
   FACS gates impossible to interpret during a long experimental day.

   Although we focused on endothelial cells, FIND is agnostic to cell
   type; we envision FIND studies that identify LNPs targeting other
   cells. Ai14 mice have recently been used to monitor LNP-mediated
   delivery to immune populations at a cellular resolution (42). Given
   that on- and off-target cells can be isolated from the same mouse, FIND
   may also be used to identify (or iteratively evolve) LNPs with high
   therapeutic windows. To further increase the ratio of splenic
   endothelial cell:hepatocyte delivery, we could incorporate
   endothelial-cell-targeting ligands (43, 44).

   More generally, this ability to study how hundreds of LNPs target
   combinations of cells in vivo may elucidate relationships between LNP
   structure and in vivo functional delivery. In this case, FIND enabled
   us to quickly identify two lead LNPs. Here we delivered sgRNAs
   targeting the inflammation-related gene ICAM-2. However, the long-term
   utility of FIND will be defined by its ability to identify
   nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing more efficiently than the
   current gold standard, which is in vitro screening. Relatedly, to fully
   utilize the large in vivo datasets generated by FIND, efforts will need
   to be made to develop high-throughput ways of characterizing LNP
   characterizations zeta-potential, pK[a], and lipid bilayer structure.
   We believe that, in time, these advances will help position FIND to
   help facilitate the discovery of structure–activity relationships to
   nonliver tissues. In future studies, it will also be important to
   further improve the efficiency of gene editing in endothelial cells
   beyond 20%.

   We did not observe noticeable experimental variability within a given
   FIND screening experiment. We quantified the consistency of the
   sequencing readouts by analyzing the normalized DNA delivery values
   between bioreplicates. In all cell types, in each of the three screens,
   there were no overt differences between bioreplicates, suggesting the
   precision of the sequencing was high (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In
   individual LNP testing, we did observe variability in hepatocyte
   delivery when 7C3 was administered over several batches to a total of
   34 mice. Notably, delivery to splenic ECs was consistent, as was the
   (lack of) delivery to all other tested cell types. We were unable to
   identify the chemical variations that led to batch variability in
   hepatocyte targeting. Two possibilities that will require further
   investigation include variable LNP chemical structure and variable mRNA
   activity. Performing FIND screens with well-defined compounds could
   minimize batch-to-batch variability.

   We note that when testing many new LNPs batch variability may be
   observed since the formulations are not yet optimized. However, this
   issue is not related to FIND or to pooled LNP screens; it is just as
   likely to occur when LNPs are tested individually. We believe FIND may
   actually minimize unwanted error in two ways. First, Cre-based
   reporters quantify delivery at the level of cell type. Identifying the
   cell type with batch issues is much easier than with two common
   approaches used in the field today: mRNA encoding luciferase or
   erythropoietin, which quantifies protein production at the tissue- and
   organism-level, respectively. Second, when nanoparticles are screened
   individually, missed injections, small changes in time points, mouse
   age, and other variables can introduce “silent” experimental
   variability that affects how LNP1 performs, relative to LNP2. Here, we
   inject all of the nanoparticles into the same mouse, which helps to
   reduce these sources of unintentional experimental variance. At the
   same time, FIND has several important limitations. LNPs must be stable
   and must be well-tolerated. Like all DNA-based screens, it is
   imperative to prevent DNA contamination.

   Finally, we note that the doses of mRNA or gene editing constructs that
   are well-tolerated after systemic administration to patients has not
   yet been established. In one related example, the FDA approved ONPATTRO
   therapeutic, which is an siRNA systemically administered in an LNP, at
   a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. This may provide an initial estimate of the mRNA
   doses that are tolerated in the clinic. However, Cas9 mRNA is >100
   times larger than a single siRNA duplex (∼4,500-nt ssRNA vs. 21-nt
   dsRNA). As a result, there is still a need to further improve the
   potency of the drug delivery systems as well as the mRNA drugs to
   advance novel Cas9 therapies into the clinic. Despite these caveats,
   FIND is a robust method to quantify how hundreds of LNPs deliver mRNA
   to any combination of cell types in vivo. We believe FIND is
   well-positioned to help identify LNPs with novel tropisms, which could
   lead to improved nonliver RNA drugs.

Materials and Methods

Nanoparticle Formulation.

   Nanoparticles were formulated using a microfluidic device as previously
   described (26). Briefly, nucleic acids (mRNA, DNA barcodes, siRNA, and
   sgRNA) were diluted in 10 mM citrate buffer (Teknova) while lipid-amine
   compounds, alkyl-tailed PEG, cholesterol, and helper lipids were
   diluted in ethanol. For nanoparticle screens, Cre mRNA and DNA barcodes
   were mixed at a 10:1 mass ratio. Citrate and ethanol phases were
   combined in a microfluidic device by syringes (Hamilton Company) at a
   flow rate of 600 µL/min and 200 µL/min, respectively. All PEGs,
   cholesterol, and helper lipids were purchased from Avanti Lipids.

DNA Barcoding.

   Each chemically distinct LNP was formulated to carry its own unique DNA
   barcode (Fig. 1). For example, LNP1 carried DNA barcode 1, while the
   chemically distinct LNP2 carried DNA barcode 2. DNA barcodes were
   designed rationally with several characteristics, as we previously
   described (20). Fifty-six- nucleotide-long ssDNA sequences were
   purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The two nucleotides on the
   5′ and 3′ ends of the 56-nt ssDNA were modified with phosphorothioates
   to reduce exonuclease degradation and improve DNA barcode stability. To
   ensure equal amplification of each sequence, we included universal
   forward and reverse primer regions on all barcodes. To monitor for PCR
   bias, each barcode was also designed with seven random nucleotides.
   Each barcode was distinguished using a unique 8-bp sequence. An 8-bp
   sequence can generate over 4^8 (65,536) distinct barcodes. We used 240
   distinct 8-bp sequences designed by to prevent sequence bleaching on
   the Illumina MiniSeq sequencing machine.

Nanoparticle Characterization.

   LNP hydrodynamic diameter was measured using high-throughput DLS
   (DynaPro Plate Reader II; Wyatt). LNPs were diluted in sterile 1× PBS
   to a concentration of ∼0.06 μg/mL and analyzed. To avoid using unstable
   LNPs, and to enable sterile purification using a 0.22-μm filter, LNPs
   were included only if they met three criteria: diameter >20 nm,
   diameter <200 nm, and correlation function with one inflection point.
   Particles that met these criteria were dialyzed with 1× PBS
   (Invitrogen) and were sterile-filtered with a 0.22-μm filter.

Cell Culture.

   In vitro experiments were performed using HEK.293 cells (GenTarget)
   stably transduced with a CMV-lox-GFP-stop-lox-RFP construct cultured in
   DMEM/F-12 50/50 media (Corning) supplemented by 10% (vol/vol) FBS (VWR)
   and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin–streptomycin (VWR). Cells were seeded in a
   six-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well; 24 h later, LNPs
   were added with a total mRNA dose of 100 ng. Six hours after
   transfection, media was refreshed. DNA was isolated using 50 μL of
   QuickExtract (EpiCentre).

Endocytosis Inhibition.

   For experiments shown in Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H, cells
   were incubated with endocytosis inhibitors. Specifically, 1 h before
   incubation with pooled LNPs, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated
   endocytosis (chlorpromazine, 100 μM; Alfa Aesar), caveolae-mediated
   endocytosis (genistein, 100μM; TCI America), and macropinocytosis
   [5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) Amiloride, EIPA, 50 μM; Toronto Research
   Chemicals] were added to cells.

Animal Experiments.

   All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Georgia
   Institute of Technology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
   LSL-Tomato (007914), C57BL/6J (000664), and constitutive SpCas9
   (026179) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and used
   between 5–12 wk of age. In all experiments, we used n = 3–5 mice per
   group. Mice were injected i.v. via the lateral tail vein or
   intramuscularly into the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and
   gastrocnemius. The nanoparticle concentration was determined using
   NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). For in vivo nanoparticle screens, mice
   were administered 1.5 mg/kg for intravascular and 1 mg/kg for
   intramuscular administration. The dosing schedule for each experiment
   is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7.

Cell Isolation and Staining.

   Cells were isolated 72 h after injection with LNPs unless otherwise
   noted. Mice were perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS through the right
   atrium. Tissues were finely cut and then placed in a digestive enzyme
   solution with collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), collagenase XI
   (Sigma-Aldrich), and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C at 550 rpm
   for 45 min. The digestive enzyme for heart and spleen included
   collagenase IV (32, 37, 45). Cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm
   mesh and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were stained to identify
   specific cell populations and sorted using the BD FacsFusion and BD
   Facs Aria IIIu cell sorters in the Georgia Institute of Technology
   Cellular Analysis Core. For in vitro experiments, BD Accuri C6 and BD
   FacsFusion were used. The antibody clones used were anti-CD31 (390;
   BioLegend), anti-CD45.2 (104; BioLegend), and anti-CD102 (3C4;
   BioLegend). PE anti-mCD47 (miap301; BioLegend) was used for tdTomato
   compensation. Representative flow gates are located in SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8. PBS-injected Ai14 mice were used to gate tdTomato populations
   for i.v. administration, while contralateral limbs were used to gate
   for intramuscular experiments.

Biodistribution.

   LNPs encapsulating Cy5.5-tagged DNA barcode were administered at 0.75
   mg/kg. After 3 h, tissues were isolated without perfusion, weighed
   individually, and imaged using the Licor Odyssey CLx imaging system.
   Signal intensity was normalized to tissue weight.

Endothelial RNA interference.

   C57BL/6J mice were injected with 7C2 and 7C3 with PBS, 2 mg/kg siCTRL
   (siGFP-647) (AxoLabs), or 1 mg/kg siICAM2 (AxoLabs). In all cases,
   siRNAs were chemically modified at the 2′ position to increase
   stability and negate immunostimulation. Both siGFP and siICAM2
   sequences have been previously reported several times (32, 37, 45).
   Seventy-two hours after injection, tissues were isolated and protein
   expression was determined via flow cytometry. ICAM2 MFI in PBS-treated
   mice was normalized to 100%, and all treated groups were compared with
   this control group.

Endothelial Gene Editing.

   Mice constitutively expressing SpCas9 were injected three times with
   7C2 or 7C3 carrying 1.5 mg/kg of two chemically modified sgRNAs with
   thee nucleotides modified on the 5′ and 5′ ends (TriLink
   Biotechnologies) targeting ICAM2 (sgICAM2ab) (1:1 mass ratio).
   Separately, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg with 7C2
   and 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and sgICAM2ab at a 3:1 mass ratio. Five days after the
   last injection, tissues were isolated, and ICAM2 protein expression was
   measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells were sorted into
   QuickExtract. Next, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg
   with 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and e-sgICAM2 (AxoLabs) at a 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 mass
   ratio. Five days after the last injection, tissues were isolated, and
   ICAM2 protein expression was measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells
   were sorted into QuickExtract. Indel formation was measured by TIDE
   (https://www.deskgen.com/landing/tide.html).

Tissue Immunostaining.

   Excised organs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron
   Microscopy Systems) in PBS. Tissues were washed twice in PBS and
   cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS until the organs sank to the bottom
   of the container. Organs were then embedded in optimal cutting
   temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned (10 μm) onto
   slides. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides for 10 min in a
   pressure cooker using low-pH antigen-retrieval solution (Life
   Technologies). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
   (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) before being
   blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in
   PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated with anti-VE cadherin (BV13;
   Biolegend), diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. After three
   washes with PBS, sections were incubated at RT with Alexa Flour 647
   conjugated donkey anti-rat (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 2 h.
   After two PBS washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life
   Technologies), and coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Life
   Technologies).

   Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera on a
   PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope mounted to a
   Zeiss Axiovert 200M body. Single-cell images were acquired using
   Volocity (PerkinElmer) with Z-stacks taken in 0.2-μm increments with a
   63× N.A. 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Stitched images were acquired
   using a 20× N.A. 0.8 objective with an automated XY stage (ASI)
   controlled by Volocity and set to 20% overlap. All images were linearly
   contrast enhanced.

PCR Amplification.

   All samples were amplified and prepared for sequencing using a one-step
   PCR protocol as previously described (20). More specifically, 1 μL of
   primers (5 μM for final reverse/forward, 0.5 μM for base forward) were
   added to 5 μL of Kapa HiFi 2× master mix, and 4 μL template DNA/water.
   The reaction was run for 30 cycles. When the PCR did not produce clear
   bands, the primer concentrations, DNA template input, PCR temperature,
   and number of cycles were optimized for individual samples.

Deep Sequencing.

   Illumina deep sequencing was conducted in Georgia Institute of
   Technology’s Molecular Evolution core. Runs were performed on an
   Illumina Miniseq. Primers were designed based on Nextera XT adapter
   sequences.

Data Normalization.

   Counts for each particle, per tissue, were normalized to the barcoded
   LNP mixture we injected into the mouse. This “input” DNA provided the
   DNA counts and was used to normalize DNA counts from the cells and
   tissues.

Data Analysis and Statistics.

   Sequencing results were processed using a custom Python-based tool to
   extract raw barcode counts for each tissue. These raw counts were then
   normalized with an R script prior for further analysis. Statistical
   analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 7; more specifically, one-tailed
   t test or one-way ANOVAs were used where appropriate. Data are plotted
   as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Significance

   Jawless, boneless, and virtually without fossil record, hagfish have
   long escaped systematists’ grip on their place among other fish. Yet
   their systematic resolution is critical to define vertebrates as a
   clade. Here we report an unequivocal fossil hagfish from the Cretaceous
   Mediterranean. Using this fossil to calibrate the evolutionary history
   of the group, our analysis supports hagfish and lampreys as sister
   groups, which likely diverged from one another in early Paleozoic
   times. As a result, vertebrates have a deep dichotomy, where some
   fossil jawless vertebrates sit closer to hagfish and lampreys than to
   jawed vertebrates. We showed that morphology-based analysis converged
   onto molecular inferences when characters are coded nonindependently,
   providing a case study for morphological–molecular conflicts in animal
   phylogeny.

Abstract

   Hagfish depart so much from other fishes anatomically that they were
   sometimes considered not fully vertebrate. They may represent: (i) an
   anatomically primitive outgroup of vertebrates (the morphology-based
   craniate hypothesis); or (ii) an anatomically degenerate vertebrate
   lineage sister to lampreys (the molecular-based cyclostome hypothesis).
   This systematic conundrum has become a prominent case of conflict
   between morphology- and molecular-based phylogenies. To date, the
   fossil record has offered few insights to this long-branch problem or
   the evolutionary history of hagfish in general, because unequivocal
   fossil members of the group are unknown. Here, we report an unequivocal
   fossil hagfish from the early Late Cretaceous of Lebanon. The soft
   tissue anatomy includes key attributes of living hagfish: cartilages of
   barbels, postcranial position of branchial apparatus, and chemical
   traces of slime glands. This indicates that the suite of characters
   unique to living hagfish appeared well before Cretaceous times. This
   new hagfish prompted a reevaluation of morphological characters for
   interrelationships among jawless vertebrates. By addressing
   nonindependence of characters, our phylogenetic analyses recovered
   hagfish and lampreys in a clade of cyclostomes (congruent with the
   cyclostome hypothesis) using only morphological data. This new
   phylogeny places the fossil taxon within the hagfish crown group, and
   resolved other putative fossil cyclostomes to the stem of either
   hagfish or lamprey crown groups. These results potentially resolve the
   morphological–molecular conflict at the base of the Vertebrata. Thus,
   assessment of character nonindependence may help reconcile
   morphological and molecular inferences for other major discords in
   animal phylogeny.

   Hagfish and lampreys (cyclostomes) represent the only living lineages
   of jawless vertebrates (or agnathans) (1). Cyclostomes are generally
   considered primitive morphologically with respect to jawed vertebrates
   (gnathostomes) (1, 2). However, consensus is still lacking about
   cyclostome relationships. None of the traits proposed to unite hagfish
   and lampreys sets them apart clearly from extinct lineages of jawless
   vertebrates (3, 4). Furthermore, characters distribute asymmetrically.
   Hagfish have fewer traits than lampreys in common with gnathostomes,
   and are characterized by rudimentary state or absence of otherwise
   pan-vertebrate traits such as electroreceptors or taste buds (5, 6).
   Thus, resolving the cyclostome relationships holds direct implications
   for defining the vertebrate crown group, and for describing early
   character evolution in that clade. Motivated by this prospect, a number
   of analyses have set out to clarify positions of hagfish and lampreys
   with respect to gnathostomes.

   The endeavor has generated variants of four main topological schemes
   (Fig. 1 A–D). Early classifications split vertebrates between agnathans
   and gnathostomes, with cyclostomes nested within the former (Fig. 1A)
   (7). With the advent of cladistics, this dichotomy was challenged:
   hagfish fell outside the vertebrate node, rendering cyclostomes
   paraphyletic (craniate hypothesis; Fig. 1B) (8). More recent analyses
   of morphological data continue to support the paraphyly, but differ
   from the earlier analyses in placing fossil agnathans on the
   gnathostome stem (Fig. 1D) (9⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–16). Meanwhile, cyclostome
   paraphyly has been contested by molecular phylogenetics, which nearly
   unanimously favor cyclostomes as a clade (cyclostome hypothesis; Fig.
   1C) (17, 18). Thus, the controversy has been locked in a stalemate
   between the molecular inferences for cyclostome monophyly (Fig. 1C) and
   the morphologically supported cyclostome paraphyly (Fig. 1D).

   A summary of hypotheses for cyclostome relationships. The hypotheses
   differ in cyclostome monophyly or paraphyly (columns), and about
   relationships of fossil “agnathans” with respect to the cyclostome and
   gnathostome crowns (rows). Blue box = support from morphological data;
   red box = support from molecular data. Yellow box = compatible with
   both data types. (A) Noncladistic classification schemes based on
   morphological data with cyclostomes nested among agnathans. (B)
   Craniate hypothesis in early cladistic analyses based on morphological
   data, where hagfish and fossil agnathans become nested outside the
   crown vertebrate node. (C) Cyclostome hypothesis as supported by
   molecular data. Fossil agnathans are assumed on the gnathostome stem.
   (D) Craniate hypothesis in recent analyses of morphological data, where
   hagfish remain nested outside the crown vertebrate node. Fossil
   agnathans are placed on the gnathostome stem. (E) Updated cyclostome
   hypothesis supported by the analyses of morphological data presented in
   this paper. Hagfish and lampreys form a clade of cyclostomes as
   supported by the molecular inferences. However, some fossil agnathans
   are closer to the cyclostome crown than to the gnathostome crown.

   Despite the ever more complete molecular datasets, consensus has not
   been achieved. This is because (i) monophyly is an anticipated outcome
   of long-branch attraction in molecular data; and (ii) fossil taxa that
   potentially break up the long branches are only accessible via
   morphological data. Interpretations of character polarities are
   radically different between the two topologies. The
   morphology-supported paraphyly implies rudimentary state or absence of
   traits in hagfish as primitive (8). For the monophyly, molecular trees
   are agnostic about character polarities, but the rudiments and absence
   in hagfish tend to be interpreted as secondary (2, 3). An equally
   parsimonious alternative— hagfish as primitive and lampreys and
   gnathostomes as convergent—is rarely discussed (2). As such, cyclostome
   relationships provide a classic example of long-branch problems
   hindering morphological–molecular congruence.

   Although fossils are critical in reducing branch lengths, the patchy
   fossil record of cyclostomes remains a formidable challenge. For
   hagfish (myxinoids), three soft-bodied Carboniferous forms
   (Gilpichthys, Myxineidus, and Myxinikela) have each been posited as a
   stem myxinoid (19⇓–21), but myxinoid affinities for the former two have
   been questioned (9, 22, 23). Myxinikela is the sole putative myxinoid
   with any degree of cladistic support (9), but its similarities to
   living hagfish may partly be artifacts of preservation (23). As these
   Carboniferous forms are only preserved with a handful of morphological
   structures, the inferences have been based on a few myxinoid- or
   cyclostome-diagnostic characters (potential keratinous teeth in
   Gilpichthys; a longitudinally elongate nasohypophyseal system in
   Myxinikela) and the general absence of lamprey-like traits (e.g., oral
   funnel, discrete dorsal fins) (19⇓–21). Consequently, living hagfishes
   imply long ghost lineages, making it difficult to interpret the
   peculiar morphology of the group. Here, we report an unequivocal
   hagfish fossil from the Late Cretaceous of Lebanon—which reduces this
   gap in the fossil record by 100 My—and present an updated
   morphology-based phylogeny of cyclostomes. We also describe the
   exquisitely preserved soft-tissue anatomy of this new hagfish using
   trace elements mapped by synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence
   (SRS-XRF; described in Methods and SI Appendix, Part B).

Etymology.

   The generic name is derived from “Tethys” after the Tethys Sea and
   “myxinos” (Latinized Greek for “slimy fish”). The specific name is
   derived from “tapirus” (Latinized Old Tupi for tapir) and “rostrum” (a
   Latin root for snout) for the elongated tapering snout.

Horizon and Locality.

   The type specimen was collected from sublithographic limestones of
   Hâdjula Lagerstätte (Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous), 10 km east of
   Byblos, Lebanon. The locality is interpreted as an interreef basin on a
   carbonate platform (24). See SI Appendix, Part A for detailed
   information on provenance and geological settings.

Diagnosis.

   Tethymyxine tapirostrum is a myxinoid exhibiting the following unique
   combination of characters: tapering nasohypophyseal profile; tentacular
   cartilage not extending beyond nasohypophyseal aperture; prebranchial
   length nearly equal to branchial length; 8 pairs of branchial pouches;
   133 slime glands on one side; and caudal fin not expanded into a round
   lobe.

Description and Comparisons.

   In visible light, BHI 6445 (Fig. 2) is preserved in full-body outline
   with soft tissues (body length = 313 mm). The trunk lies on its left
   side, whereas the head was twisted counterclockwise to expose the
   ventral side. The preserved tissues are marked by greater abundance of
   P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn relative to the surrounding matrix (Fig. 2C and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These tissues are inferred to be (i) composed of
   collagenous extracellular matrix (e.g., chondrocranium); (ii) enclosed
   by a highly vascularized epithelial sheet (e.g., branchial pouches,
   livers); or (iii) secreted keratin (e.g., infillings of slime glands,
   tooth-like apparatus). The original outline of the body is clearly
   demarcated from the matrix in most elements mapped by SRS-XRF (Fig. 2C
   and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Al, P, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and As are
   markedly more abundant in the preserved tissues than in the matrix,
   whereas the reverse is true for Si, Ca, and Hg. The preservation of
   structures and imprints is partly obscured by glue and paint, but the
   fossilized tissues can be distinguished from artifacts. Optically, the
   structural preservation is distinguished by surface topography under
   the artifacts. In SRS-XRF, the artifacts are clearly differentiated
   from the fossil and matrix based on distributions of S, Ti, V, and Fe.
   In particular, X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals differential
   distributions of sulfur species in this specimen (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S4). Sulfate is the dominant species in all residues; organic sulfur is
   present in both the fossil and matrix, but virtually absent in the glue
   (SI Appendix, Part B). This result highlights the utility of SRS-XRF in
   identifying curatorial artifacts in fossil specimens.

   The preservation of decay-prone soft tissues such as branchial pouches
   and slime (Fig. 2) suggests that BHI 6445 was rapidly buried (25).
   Although the mode of preservation is similar to that of the Early
   Cretaceous freshwater lamprey Mesomyzon from the Jehol Group of China,
   internal structures of BHI 6445 are not obscured by the preserved
   integument and muscles as in specimens of Mesomyzon (26) (for detailed
   discussion, see SI Appendix, Part A).

   The overall characteristics clearly reject nonmyxinoid hypotheses for
   the identity of BHI 6445. The absence of a mineralized skeleton, paired
   fins, and jaws rules out anguilliform gnathostomes like the coeval eel
   Luenchelys (27). BHI 6445 is not a lamprey either, because it does not
   have an oral sucker, tectal cartilages, branchial basket, dorsal fins,
   and other skeletal and proportional features of lampreys that would
   have been present given the state of preservation (25). Instead, BHI
   6445 has characters diagnostic of myxinoids, including an elongate
   nasohypophyseal portion of the chondrocranium, posteriorly placed
   branchial pouches, and slime glands.

   Tethymyxine has a small head relative to its body size. The
   prebranchial length of BHI 6445 is shorter than that in living
   hagfishes, relative to the total body length (13% versus 20–30%) (28).
   As a consequence, the first branchial pouch sits more anteriorly than
   in living hagfish species, leaving a relatively short space for the
   lingual apparatus to occupy. The snout tapers toward the
   nasohypophyseal aperture (nostril). The nasohypophyseal barbels are
   preserved with the sigmoidal tentacular cartilage on the left side of
   BHI 6445. The barbels sit behind the aperture as in living Rubicundus
   (29) (Fig. 3 B and C), but the specimen differs from it in lacking a
   protruded nasohypophyseal tube. The tentacular cartilage is fused
   posteriorly with the lateral element of the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Both the left and right parts of the keratinous tooth
   plates are preserved in association with the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Although several cusps can be identified by the
   distributions of Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Hg (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), precise
   cusp number and shape cannot be determined. Unlike the preservation of
   comb-like tooth plates in Gilpichthys from Mazon Creek (20), the plates
   may have been pyrolysated in BHI 6445 as seen in the scales of
   actinopterygians from the same locality (27). Presumably the missing
   counterpart of BHI 6445 has the rest of preserved chondrocranial
   elements.

   A time-scaled phylogenetic tree of cyclostomes. (A) Summary tree
   showing cyclostome relationships. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   inferences converged onto each other in placing Tethymyxine within the
   hagfish crown group and supporting cyclostome monophyly. The precise
   topology is from the maximum parsimony analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
   Node ages represent median of 95% HPD distribution in a Bayesian
   molecular clock analysis of mitogenomic sequences (16S and COI) under
   fossilized birth–death model (see SI Appendix, Fig. S9 for a fully
   calibrated maximum clade credibility tree with node intervals). The
   crown group of cyclostomes is united by at least two morphological
   characters (shown on each stem): keratinous tooth plates (yellow) and
   periocular position of trunk muscles (red). At Top Right, the
   nasohypophyseal profiles are compared in ventral view among three
   selected crown-group hagfishes (B: Tethymyxine tapirostrum; C,
   Rubicundus eos; D, Eptatretus stoutii; the latter two based on ref.
   29). To show morphological divergence among the three major crown
   groups of living vertebrates (E, myxinoids; F, petromyzontiforms; G,
   gnathostomes), each is accompanied by a chondrocranium in left lateral
   view (green: neural crest-derived nasohypophyseal skeleton; red:
   mesodermally derived neurocranium; blue: neural crest-derived
   pharyngeal skeleton). Filled squares represent occurrences of the
   terminal taxa. Crown nodes are each indicated by a filled circle, and
   total nodes by an empty circle. Abbreviations: nha, nasohypophyseal
   aperture; nhb, nasohypophyseal barbels; mo, mouth; ob, oral barbels.

   Tethymyxine has eight pairs of branchial pouches. This number is
   greater than in Rubicundus spp. (n = 5) and most other living hagfishes
   (n = 4∼7), equal to some species of Eptatretus and Nemamyxyne, and
   smaller than in some species of Eptatretus (n = 14 in E. polytrema)
   (28). A structure immediately behind the branchial series is
   topographically and morphologically consistent with a heart, which has
   Fe in higher abundance than in the surrounding tissues (Fig. 2 D and
   E). The intestine extends between the anterior and posterior liver
   lobes. These visceral tissues have different textures and colors that
   allow clear delineation under natural light (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
   However, the element mapping by SRS-XRF shows similar compositions
   among these tissues. P, S, and Cl appear to have greater abundances in
   the branchial pouches than in the intestine, and Ca seems to be the
   reverse (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

   A characteristic unique to hagfish, slime glands are preserved in an
   uninterrupted series of infillings that extends nearly the entire
   length of the body on the ventral side. The infillings are
   distinguished from other tissues by surface profile, high Ca, P, and S
   abundances, and higher levels of Cl, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Hg
   relative to the matrix (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and
   Table S1). The chemical mapping is consistent with the fact that a
   major component of hagfish slime is tightly coiled, mucin-coated
   α-keratin threads (30)—pyrolysates of which are characterized by
   calcium phosphatic content (31). The number of the slime glands (n =
   133 on the right) is greater than in most living hagfishes (n =
   70∼110), but close to that of R. eos (n = 128∼130) (28). The end of the
   tail is obscured by paint, but it is possible to outline the body by
   relatively high concentrations of Cu, P, S, and Fe (contained in paint,
   but higher in preserved tissues) and relatively low concentrations of
   Ca (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 and Table S1). The
   notochord is difficult to identify optically (as it is generally in
   fossils of soft-bodied vertebrates), but can be delineated with the
   high P and S concentrations along the dorsal midline (SI Appendix,
   Figs. S3 and S4 B and C). The tail tapers rather than expanding into a
   round lobe.

Phylogenetics.

   We generated a morphological dataset to test the relationships of
   Tethymyxine and cyclostomes. Tethymyxine has myxinoid apomorphies not
   identified in other fossil taxa. These traits include the posteriorly
   placed branchial series and slime glands, which are absent, missing, or
   ambiguous in Myxinikela and other putative fossil cyclostomes (9). To
   code these unequivocal and potential myxinoids in a phylogenetic
   dataset, we reevaluated morphological characters that are
   nonindependent, and enhanced contingency coding to reduce implicit
   weighting (32). For example, attributes of a mineralized skeleton such
   as bones and scales are not simply absent in the soft-bodied myxinoids.
   Those characters are inapplicable in this lineage. Applying no
   character values to attributes of biomineralization in myxinoids
   removes additive weight of lacking mineralization in every coded
   skeletal element. This contingency coding eliminated, on average, 70%
   of character information from nonvertebrate outgroups and 32% from
   cyclostomes, which would otherwise be available to coding (SI Appendix,
   Parts B–D and Fig. S5 for comparative analysis).

   Searches of this dataset, using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   methods, resolved Tethymyxine within the myxinoid crown group, sister
   to species of the living genus Rubicundus (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6–S8). These two genera with an elongate snout, indented
   barbels, and a large number of slime glands (>100) (Fig. 3 B and C)
   were nested outside the clade of more conventional living myxinoids
   (Eptatretus, Myxine, and Neomyxine) (Fig. 3D). Myxinikela was resolved
   as a stem myxinoid, whereas other Carboniferous forms (Gilpichthys,
   Hardistiella, Mayomyzon, and Myxineidus) and Priscomyzon were found
   along the stem of lampreys. Under maximum parsimony, the crown group of
   cyclostomes is united by two unambiguous character changes: keratinous
   tooth plates and migration of postotic myomeres to position of eyes
   (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S3). Euconodonts, Pipiscius, and
   anaspids fell into the cyclostome stem. Together, these lineages
   comprised the total group of cyclostomes. Controversial Cambrian forms
   (Haikouella, Haikouichthys, Metaspriggina, and Myllokunmingia) were
   resolved in the vertebrate stem.

   Given the topology obtained in the maximum parsimony analysis, and
   using the fossil-calibrated dataset of mitogenomic sequences, tip-dated
   Bayesian estimates of divergence placed the crown cyclostome node from
   the earliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) to Early Silurian (Wenlockian)
   times [95% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 536.31–428.44 Mya]
   with median near the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary (485.57 Mya) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S9). Both the myxinoid and petromyzontiform crowns were
   estimated to have their origins in Mesozoic times, with the myxinoid
   estimates straddling the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary (95% HPD:
   183.95–103.30 Mya; median: 138.59 Mya) and with the petromyzontiform
   estimates within the Jurassic times (95% HPD: 194.84–163.14 Mya;
   median: 169.82 Mya).

Discussion

   Tethymyxine is significant as being the sole fossil of the crown group
   Myxinoidea. It therefore provides a crucial calibration point for the
   evolution of the myxinoid clade as well as the distinctive morphology
   of the group. In our dataset, the myxinoid topologies were robust to
   altered character coding schemes (assuming taphonomic artifacts) or
   different taxonomic combinations (SI Appendix, Part C and Fig. S8).
   Multiple traits of the myxinoid crown in Tethymyxine are lacking in the
   Carboniferous stem myxinoid Myxinikela. In Myxinikela, the branchial
   apparatus sits well within the cranial domain, and the liver appears to
   be a single lobe. Given its state of preservation, α-keratin in the
   slime glands would have been preserved if present in Myxinikela. Thus,
   these crown myxinoid traits were likely acquired along the remaining
   200–250 My ghost lineage (Fig. 3A).

   Our analyses reveal cyclostomes as a clade using morphological data.
   Both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses converged on this result
   with the same clade membership (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). The
   dataset performed consistently with theoretical predictions (33).
   Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences generated trees that are
   largely congruent with each other. The maximum parsimony trees are
   better resolved (more precise) than the Bayesian trees. Importantly,
   cyclostome monophyly based on morphology corroborates the topology
   consistently supported by molecular data (17, 18). The
   fossil-calibrated mitogenomic molecular clock (SI Appendix, Fig. S9)
   also produced divergence estimates for cyclostome crown clades that are
   largely congruent with the previous molecular clock analysis of nuclear
   genes (34). For the cyclostome crown, our divergence estimates
   (536.31–428.44 Mya) agree well with the previous estimates (480–430
   Mya). Calibrated with Tethymyxine (100.5–93.9 Mya), the myxinoid crown
   is now pushed to an older interval (183.95–103.30 Mya) than in the
   previous analysis (90–40 Mya). The petromyzontiform crown is estimated
   shallower (194.84–163.14 Mya) than in the analysis of nuclear genes
   (280–220 Mya), but the split between the southern and northern
   hemispheric clades is constrained to before the separation and breakup
   of Gondwana in both analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (34).

   This morphological–molecular congruence is a significant update of the
   cyclostome hypothesis (Fig. 1 C and E). One principal advance is
   phylogenetic resolution of fossil jawless vertebrates under cyclostome
   monophyly. These fossil forms include (i) putative stem taxa of
   cyclostome lineages (e.g., Myxinikela), and (ii) lineages that have
   been placed on the gnathostome stem under cyclostome paraphyly (e.g.,
   anaspids and euconodonts). Molecular datasets contain no information
   from the fossils, but previous schemes of the cyclostome hypothesis
   assumed the taxa within cyclostomes and the taxa on the gnathostome
   stem without including them all in a single cladistic test (18). The
   stem cyclostome status of anaspids and euconodonts has never been
   supported quantitatively in previous analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6 and S8). Furthermore, our Bayesian analysis (i) did not
   resolve the polytomy of several other lineages with cyclostome and
   gnathostome total clades; and (ii) supported euconodonts as stem
   myxinoids (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These results are reminiscent of
   early classification schemes of cyclostomes (Fig. 1 A and B) and
   precladistic attempts to classify conodonts, but have the basis in
   different characters.

   Our morphological dataset has a long list of characters that support
   cyclostome monophyly and stem cyclostome status of anaspids and
   euconodonts (SI Appendix, Table S3). The crown has two unambiguous
   synapomorphies in keratinous tooth plates and periocular position of
   trunk myomeres (Fig. 3A). The characters posited previously as
   cyclostome synapomorphies (e.g., pulley-like feeding apparatus) (4) are
   either not preserved in fossils [thus optimized to the crown cyclostome
   node only under delayed transformation (DELTRAN)] or symplesiomorphic
   to cyclostomes. In comparison, keratin is decay-resistant relative to
   other soft tissues (25), and myomeric positions can be determined using
   a number of osteological correlates, such as postbranchial wall in
   osteostracans (10). As for euconodonts, their position in the
   cyclostome stem is supported by the lack of anterior extension of the
   midline fin and the presence of denticulate elements within the buccal
   cavity (SI Appendix, Table S3). Recent attempts to associate conodonts
   with cyclostomes (or myxinoids) were based on the inferred presence of
   a pulley-like feeding apparatus (35) or the alleged homology of
   conodont elements with the keratinous tooth plates in living
   cyclostomes (36, 37). Both of these characters were coded as ambiguous
   in euconodonts in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Nevertheless, the
   Bayesian inferences supported the stem-myxinoid position. For
   parsimony, the cyclostome crown collapsed after coding these ambiguous
   characters for conodonts as seen in living cyclostomes (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8C).

   The morphological support for cyclostome monophyly emerged after
   enhancement of contingency coding method. Nearly all cyclostome
   synapomorphies in our dataset were included in previous morphological
   datasets in various definitions and coding schemes, and would have been
   optimized as cyclostome synapomorphies if the topology were constrained
   (SI Appendix, Table S4). These datasets suggest a number of other
   characters as potentially synapomorphic to cyclostomes under the same
   topological constraint. In our dataset, most of those additional
   characters are symplesiomorphic to cyclostomes (denoted with “§,” SI
   Appendix, Table S4) optimized in opposite character polarity (**), or
   parsimony-uninformative and not included (‡)—all consequences of
   assigning nonapplicable scores within those characters (SI Appendix,
   Parts D and E). Recoding nonapplicable scores to discrete character
   states resurrected paraphyletic cyclostomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).

   Our phylogeny implies hagfish morphology as specialized, not primitive.
   In myxinoids, trait absence or underdeveloped condition has been
   difficult to interpret—whether the absence (e.g., electroreceptors or
   extrinsic eye musculature) represents an ancestral or secondary
   condition, or whether the underdeveloped traits (e.g., vertebrae) are
   rudimentary or vestigial. Hagfish nested within cyclostomes suggest
   that these are derived states. Indeed, a large number of reversal
   events are optimized between the total and crown myxinoid nodes under
   both accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) and DELTRAN (SI Appendix,
   Table S3). Regarding those listed traits, hagfish appear to have lost
   them secondarily, in line with the narrative of the cyclostome
   hypothesis (5, 38). These character changes are parallel with
   acquisitions of the traits unique to hagfish, such as slime glands (SI
   Appendix, Table S3). Even cyclostomes on the whole appear to be rather
   specialized than primitive. The last common ancestor of all living
   vertebrates has often been posited as a soft-bodied
   hagfish/lamprey-like form (1). However, the stem cyclostome status of
   anaspids and euconodonts in the new phylogeny implies that the
   potential to mineralize skeletal matrix predated the cyclostome crown.
   This scenario is consistent with observations that modern hagfish and
   lampreys deposit calcium phosphates to line their inner ears (39), or
   that lamprey cartilages spontaneously calcify in vitro (40).

Conclusions

   An assessment of nonindependence among morphological characters may
   lead to unexpected congruence when a phylogenetic dispute is locked in
   a stalemate between internally consistent morphological and molecular
   inferences. Our phylogenetic analysis of cyclostomes provides one such
   case study. In this phylogeny of cyclosotmes, the new fossil hagfish
   Tethymyxine represents an important calibration point not just for the
   divergence of the myxinoid crown, but also for many morphological
   traits (e.g., slime glands) that set hagfish apart from all other
   vertebrates. The morphologically supported Cyclostomi implies some of
   the characters conventionally considered primitive in hagfish (e.g.,
   the absence of extraocular muscles, electroreceptors, or taste buds) as
   specialized. This view is consistent with the developmental features of
   hagfish interpreted as vestigial and derived (e.g., axial skeleton)
   (38, 41). Between two living cyclostome lineages, lampreys may serve as
   a better outgroup to gnathostomes, but a full extent of their utility
   as an outgroup remains unknown until evolutionary origins of the
   peculiar life history (distinct larval phase with dramatic
   metamorphosis) are resolved (42, 43).

Methods

   SRS-XRF was performed at beam line 6–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron
   Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
   SRS-XRF is a noninvasive technique that can spatially resolve chemical
   element composition in large samples in short time frames (44). For the
   new phylogeny, three lines of analyses were performed: (i) maximum
   parsimony analyses; (ii) nonclock Bayesian analyses; and (iii) clock
   analyses. The morphological dataset was the same for all of the
   analyses and included 52 taxa (SI Appendix, Table S2) and 168
   characters (SI Appendix, Part E). For the parsimony analyses, heuristic
   search was used with no topological constraint. For the non-clock-based
   Bayesian analyses, each analysis was run for 5 million generations with
   2 runs of 4 chains, without topological constraint, and sampling every
   5,000 generations. Finally, we generated a dataset with 16S and COI
   sequences for extant taxa and with fossil calibrations. This dataset
   was subjected to a Bayesian analysis under the fossilized birth–death
   model, given topology obtained from the parsimony analysis. This
   analysis provided divergence estimates shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S9.
   For full description, see SI Appendix, Parts B–E. Original data for
   SRS-XRF and phylogenetic analyses are placed in a permanent depository
   (45).

Significance

   The Pólya–Jensen criterion for the Riemann hypothesis asserts that RH
   is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of certain Jensen polynomials for
   all degrees d≥1 and all shifts n. For each degree d≥1, we confirm this
   criterion for all sufficiently large shifts n. This represents a
   theoretical advance in the field. The method of proof is rooted in the
   newly discovered phenomenon that these polynomials are nicely
   approximated by Hermite polynomials. Furthermore, it is shown that this
   method applies to a large class of related problems.

Abstract

   In 1927, Pólya proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)
   at its point of symmetry. This hyperbolicity has been proved for
   degrees d≤3. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the central
   derivatives ζ(2n)(1/2) that is accurate to all orders, which allows us
   to prove the hyperbolicity of all but finitely many of the Jensen
   polynomials of each degree. Moreover, we establish hyperbolicity for
   all d≤8. These results follow from a general theorem which models such
   polynomials by Hermite polynomials. In the case of the Riemann zeta
   function, this proves the Gaussian unitary ensemble random matrix model
   prediction in derivative aspect. The general theorem also allows us to
   prove a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang on the partition function.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

   Expanding on notes of Jensen, Pólya (1) proved that the Riemann
   hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of the Jensen
   polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) at its point of
   symmetry. More precisely, he showed that the RH is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of all Jensen polynomials associated with the sequence of
   Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} defined
   by−1+4z2 Λ12+z=∑n=0∞γ(n)n!⋅z2n,[1]where Λ(s)=π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s)=Λ(1−s),
   where we say that a polynomial with real coefficients is hyperbolic if
   all of its zeros are real, and where the Jensen polynomial of degree d
   and shift n of an arbitrary sequence {α(0),α(1),α(2),…} of real numbers
   is the polynomialJαd,n(X)≔∑j=0ddjα(n+j)Xj.[2]Thus, the RH is equivalent
   to the hyperbolicity of the polynomials Jγd,n(X) for all nonnegative
   integers d and n (1⇓–3). Since this condition is preserved under
   differentiation, to prove RH, it would be enough to show hyperbolicity
   for the Jγd,0(X).* Due to the difficulty of proving RH, research has
   focused on establishing hyperbolicity for all shifts n for small d.
   Previous to this paper, hyperbolicity was known for d≤3 by work^† of
   Csordas et al. (5) and Dimitrov and Lucas (3).

   Asymptotics for the γ(n) were obtained from Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov
   (7). We improve on their results by obtaining an arbitrary precision
   asymptotic formula^‡(Theorem 9), a result that is of independent
   interest. We will use this strengthened result to prove the following
   theorem for all degrees d.

Theorem 1.

   If d≥1, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for all sufficiently large n.

   An effective proof of Theorem 1 for small d gives the following
   theorem.

Theorem 2.

   If 1≤d≤8, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for every n≥0.

   Theorem 1 follows from a general phenomenon that Jensen polynomials for
   a wide class of sequences α can be modeled by the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), which we define (in a somewhat nonstandard normalization) as the
   orthogonal polynomials for the measure μ(X)=e−X2/4 or more explicitly
   by the generating
   function∑d=0∞Hd(X) tdd! = e−t2+Xt = 1 +X t + (X2−2) t22! + (X3−6X) t33!
    + ⋯ .[3]More precisely, we will prove the following general theorem
   describing the limiting behavior of Jensen polynomials of sequences
   with appropriate growth.

Theorem 3.

   Let {α(n)}, {A(n)}, and {δ(n)} be three sequences of positive real
   numbers with δ(n) tending to zero and
   satisfyinglogα(n+j)α(n)=A(n)j−δ(n)2j2+oδ(n)d as n→∞,[4]for some integer
   d≥1 and all 0≤j≤d. Then, we
   havelimn→∞δ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n)) = Hd(X),[5]uniformly for
   X in any compact subset of R.

   Since the Hermite polynomials have distinct roots, and since this
   property of a polynomial with real coefficients is invariant under
   small deformation, we immediately deduce the following corollary.

Corollary 4.

   The Jensen polynomials Jαd,n(X) for a sequence α:N→R satisfying the
   conditions in Theorem 3 are hyperbolic for all but finitely many values
   n.

   Theorem 1 is a special case of this corollary. Namely, we shall use
   Theorem 9 to prove that the Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} satisfy the
   required growth conditions in Theorem 3 for every d≥2.

   Theorem 3 in the case of the Riemann zeta function is the derivative
   aspect Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) random matrix model prediction
   for the zeros of Jensen polynomials. To make this precise, recall that
   Dyson (8), Montgomery (9), and Odlyzko (10) conjecture that the
   nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are distributed like the
   eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices. These eigenvalues satisfy
   Wigner’s Semicircular Law, as do the roots of the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), when suitably normalized, as d→+∞ (see chapter 3 of ref. 11).
   The roots of Jγd,0(X), as d→+∞, approximate the zeros of Λ12+z (see
   ref. 1 or lemma 2.2 of ref. 12), and so GUE predicts that these roots
   also obey the Semicircular Law. Since the derivatives of Λ12+z are also
   predicted to satisfy GUE, it is natural to consider the limiting
   behavior of Jγd,n(X) as n→+∞. The work here proves that these
   derivative aspect limits are the Hermite polynomials Hd(X), which, as
   mentioned above, satisfy GUE in degree aspect.

   Returning to the general case of sequences with suitable growth
   conditions, Theorem 3 has applications in combinatorics where the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials determines the log-concavity of
   enumerative statistics. For example, see the classic theorem by
   Heilmann and Leib (13), along with works by Chudnovsky and Seymour
   (14), Haglund (15), Haglund et al. (16), Stanley (17), and Wagner (18),
   to name a few. Theorem 3 represents a criterion for establishing the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials in enumerative combinatorics. The theorem
   reduces the problem to determining whether suitable asymptotics hold.
   Here, we were motivated by a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang
   concerning the Jensen polynomials Jpd,n(X), where p(n) is the partition
   function. Nicolas (19) and Desalvo and Pak (20) proved that Jp2,n(X) is
   hyperbolic for n≥25, and, more recently, Chen et al. proved (21) that
   Jp3,n(X) is hyperbolic for n≥94, inspiring them to state as a
   conjecture the following result.

Theorem 5 (Chen–Jia–Wang Conjecture).

   For every integer d≥1, there exists an integer N(d) such that Jpd,n(X)
   is hyperbolic for n≥N(d).

   Table 1 gives the conjectured minimal value for N(d) for d=2j with
   1≤j≤5. More precisely, for each d≤32 it gives the smallest integer such
   that Jpd,n(X) is hyperbolic for N(d) ≤ n ≤ 50,000.

Remark 6:

   Larson and Wagner (22) have made the proof of Theorem 5 effective by a
   brute-force implementation of Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of
   ref. 3). They showed that the values in the table are correct for d=4
   and d=5 and that N(d)≤(3d)24d(50d)3d2 in general. The true values are
   presumably much smaller and are probably of only polynomial growth, the
   numbers N(d) in the table being approximately of size 10 d2⁡log⁡d.

   Theorem 5 suggests a natural generalization. As is well known, the
   numbers p(n) are the Fourier coefficients of a modular form,
   namely,1η(τ) = ∑n=0∞ p(n) qn−124 (I(τ)>0, q=e2πiτ),[6]where
   η(τ)=q1/24∏(1−qn) is the Dedekind eta-function. Theorem 5 is then an
   example of a more general theorem about the Jensen polynomials of the
   Fourier coefficients of an arbitrary weakly holomorphic modular form,
   which, for the purposes of this work, will mean a modular form
   (possibly of fractional weight and with multiplier system) with real
   Fourier coefficients on the full modular group SL2(Z) that is
   holomorphic apart from a pole of (possibly fractional) positive order
   at infinity. If f is such a form, we denote its Fourier expansion by^§
   f(τ) = ∑n∈−m+Z≥0af(n) qn (m∈Q>0, af(−m) ≠ 0).[7]Then, we will prove the
   following theorem, which includes Theorem 5.

Theorem 7.

   If f is a weakly holomorphic modular form as above, then for any fixed
   d≥1, the Jensen polynomials Jafd,n(X) are hyperbolic for all
   sufficiently large n.

   Our results are proved by showing that each of the sequences of
   interest to us [the partition function, the Fourier coefficients of
   weakly holomorphic modular forms, and the Taylor coefficients at s=12
   of 4s(1−s)Λ(s)] satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3, which we prove
   in Section 2. Actually, in Section 2, we prove a more general result
   (Theorem 8) that gives the limits of suitably normalized Jensen
   polynomials for an even bigger class of sequences having suitable
   asymptotic properties (but without necessarily the corollary about
   hyperbolicity). Theorem 7 giving the hyperbolicity for coefficients of
   modular forms (and hence also for the partition function) is proved in
   Section 3. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 9, which gives an asymptotic
   formula to all orders for the Taylor coefficients of Λ(s) at s=12, and
   in Section 5, we prove Theorems 1 and 2 for the Riemann zeta function
   by using these asymptotics to verify that the hypotheses of Theorem 3
   are fulfilled by the numbers γ(n). We conclude in Section 6 with some
   numerical examples.

2. Proof of Theorem 3

   We deduce Theorem 3 from the following more general result.

Theorem 8.

   Suppose that {E(n)} and {δ(n)} are positive real sequences with δ(n)
   tending to 0, and that F(t)=∑i=0∞citi is a formal power series with
   complex coefficients. For a fixed d≥1, suppose that there are real
   sequences {C0(n)},…,{Cd(n)}, with limn→+∞Ci(n)=ci for 0≤i≤d, such that
   for 0≤j≤d, we
   haveα(n+j)α(n) E(n)−j = ∑i=0d Ci(n) δ(n)iji + oδ(n)d as n→+∞.[8]Then,
   the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds with  exp(A(n))  replaced by E(n) and
   Hd(X) replaced by HF,d(X), where the polynomials HF,m(X)∈C[x] are now
   defined either by the generating function F(−t) eXt=∑HF,m(X) tm/m! or
   in closed form by HF,m(X) ≔ m! ∑k=0m(−1)m−kcm−k Xk/k! .

Proof of Theorems 8 and 3.

   After replacing exp(A(n)) by E(n), the polynomial appearing on the
   left-hand side of [5]
   becomesδ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1E(n) = ∑k=0ddk δ(n)k−d ∑j=kd (−1)j−k d
   −kj−k α(n+j)α(n)E(n)j Xk.Since 0≤j≤d, and since the error term in [8]
   is o(δ(n)d), we may reorder summation and find that the limiting value
   as n→+∞ of the quantity in square brackets
   satisfieslimn→+∞∑i=0dCi(n) δ(n)k−d+i ∑j=kd(−1)j−k d−kj−k ji = (−1)d−k(d
   −k)! cd−k,because the inner sum, which is the (d−k)th difference of the
   polynomial j↦ji evaluated at j=0, vanishes for i<d−k and equals (d−k)!
   for i=d−k. Theorem 8 follows, and Theorem 3 is just the special case
   E(n)=eA(n) and F(t)=e−t2. □

3. Proof of Theorem 7

   Assume that f is a modular form of (possibly fractional) weight k on
   SL2(Z) (possibly with multiplier system) and with a pole of (possibly
   fractional) order m>0 at infinity and write its Fourier expansion at
   infinity as in [7]. It is standard, either by the circle method of
   Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher or by using Poincaré series (for example,
   see ref. 23), that the Fourier coefficients of f have the asymptotic
   formaf(n)=Af nk−12 Ik−1(4πmn)+OnC e2πmn,[9]as n→∞ for some nonzero
   constants Af [an explicit multiple of af(−m)] and C, where Iκ(x)
   denotes the usual I-Bessel function. In view of the expansion of Bessel
   functions at infinity, this implies that af(n) has an asymptotic
   expansion to all orders in 1/n of the
   formaf(n) ∼ e4πmn n2k−34 expc0 + c1n + c2n2 + ⋯,for some constants
   c0, c1, …  depending on f [and in fact only on m and k if we normalize
   the leading coefficient af(−m) of f to be equal to 1]. This gives an
   asymptotic
   expansionlogaf(n+j)af(n) ∼ 4πm ∑i=1∞1/2ijini−12 + 2k−34∑i=1∞(−1)i−1jii 
   ni + ∑i,k≥1ck−kijini+k,[10]valid to all orders in n, and it follows
   that the sequence {af(n)} satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with
   A(n)=2πm/n+O(1/n) and δ(n)=(π/2)1/2m1/4n−3/4+O(n−5/4). Theorem 7 then
   follows from the corollary to Theorem 3.

4. Asymptotics for Λ(n)(12)

   Previous work of Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov (7) offer asymptotics^¶
   for the derivatives Λ(n)12. Here, we follow a slightly different
   approach and obtain effective asymptotics, a result which is of
   independent interest. To describe our asymptotic expansion, we first
   give a formula for these derivatives in terms of an auxiliary function,
   whose asymptotic expansion we shall then determine.

   Following Riemann (cf. chapter 8 of ref. 25), we
   haveΛ(s)=∫0∞ts2−1 θ0(t) dt=1s(s−1)+∫1∞ts2+t1−s2 θ0(t) dtt,where
   θ0(t)=∑k=1∞e−πk2t=12(t−1/2−1)+t−1/2θ0(1/t). It follows
   thatΛ(n)12=− 2n+2 n!+F(n)2n−1,[11]for n>0 (both are of course zero for
   n odd), where F(n) is defined for any real n≥0
   byF(n)=∫1∞(log⁡t)n t−3/4 θ0(t) dt.[12]In particular, if n is a positive
   integer, then the Taylor coefficients γ(n) defined in [1]
   satisfyγ(n)=n!(2n)!⋅82n2Λ(2n−2)12−Λ(2n)12=n!(2n)!⋅ 322n2F(2n−2)−F(2n)22
   n−1.[13]

Theorem 9.

   If n>0, then the function F(n) defined by [12] is given to all orders
   in n by the asymptotic
   expansionF(n) ∼ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n+b2n2+⋯ (n→∞),wher
   e L=L(n)≈lognlog⁡n is the unique positive solution of the equation
   n=L(πeL+34) and each coefficient bk belongs to Q(L), the first value
   being b1=2L4+9L3+16L2+6L+224 (L+1)3.

Example 10:

   Here, we illustrate Theorem 9. The two-term
   approximationF(n) ≈ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n=:F^(n),is
   sufficiently strong for the proof of Theorem 1. In particular, Theorem
   9 and [13] implyγ^(n)≔n!(2n)!26−2n2n2F^(2n−2)=γ(n)1+O1n2−ε.[14]Here are
   some approximations γ^(n) obtained from this expression by numerically
   computing L using its defining equation above. Table 2 illustrates the
   high precision of this formula.

   Table 2.

   Comparison of γ(n) and γ^(n)

Proof of Theorem 9:

   We approximate the integrand in [12] by f(t)=(log⁡t)nt−3/4e−πt (from
   now on, we consider n as fixed and omit it from the notations). We have
   tddtlog⁡f(t)=nlog⁡t−πt−34, so f(t) assumes its unique maximum at t=a,
   where a=eL is the solution in (1,∞) ofn=πa+34log⁡a.We can then apply
   the usual saddle point method. The Taylor expansion of f(t) around t=a
   is given
   byf(1+λ)af(a)=1+log(1+λ)log⁡an(1+λ)−3/4e−πλa=e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯,where
   C=(ε+ε2)n−34 (here we have set ε=1log⁡a=L−1) and the Ai (i≥3) are
   polynomials of degree ⌊i/3⌋ in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. This
   expansion is found by expanding log(f((1+λ)a))−log(f(a)) in λ. The
   linear term vanishes by the choice of a, the quadratic term is −Cλ2/2,
   and the coefficients of the higher powers of λ are all linear
   expressions in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. Exponentiating this
   expansion gives the claimed expression for f((1+λ)a)/f(a), where the
   dominant term of each Ai is governed primarily by the exponential of
   the cubic term of the logarithmic expansion. The first few Ai
   areA3=ε3+ε22+ε33 n−14, A4=−ε4+11ε224+ε32+ε44 n+316,A5=ε5+5ε212+7ε312+ε4
   2+ε55 n − 320,A6=ε218+ε36+17ε472+ε56+ε618 n2 − ε4+91ε2180+17ε324+17ε424
   +ε52+ε66 n+532.Plugging in t=(1+λ)a immediately gives the asymptotic
   expansion∫1∞f(t) dt=a f(a) ∫−1+1/a∞e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯ dλ=a f(a) 2πC 1
   +3A4C2+15A6C3+⋯+(2i−1)!!A2iCi+⋯.(Here, only the part of the integral
   with Cλ2<B⁡log⁡n, where B is any function of n going to infinity as n
   does, contributes.) This equality and the expression in Theorem 9 are
   interpreted as asymptotic expansions. Although these series themselves
   may not converge for a fixed n, we may truncate the resulting
   approximation at O(n−A) for some A>0, and as n→+∞, this approximation
   becomes true to the specified precision. Substituting into this
   expansion the formulas for C and Ai in terms of n, we obtain the
   statement of the theorem with F(n) replaced by the integral over f(t),
   with only A2i (i≤3k) contributing to bk. But then the same asymptotic
   formula holds also for F(n), since the ratio f(t)/θ0(t)=1+e−3πt+⋯  is
   equal to 1+O(n−K) for any K>0 for t near a. □

5. Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

A. Proof of Theorem 1

   For each d≥1, we use Theorem 3 with sequences {A(n)} and {δ(n)} for
   whichlogγ(n+j)γ(n)=A(n)j−j2δ(n)2+∑i=3dgi(n)ji+oδ(n)d,[15]for all 0≤j≤d,
   where gi(n)=oδ(n)i. Stirling’s formula, [13], and [14]
   giveγ(n)=en−2nn+12(1+112n)Ln^2n^−3n^n^+12(1+112n^)2πK⋅expL4−n^L+341+b1(
   n^)n^1+O1n2−ε,[16]where n^≔2n−2, L≔L(n^), and
   K≔K(n^)≔L(n^)−1+L(n^)−2n^−3/4. The L(n^) are values of a nonvanishing
   holomorphic function for R(n)>1, and so for |j|<n−1, we have the Taylor
   expansionL(j;n)≔L(n^+2j)L(n^)=1+∑m≥1ℓm(n)jmm!.If J=λ(n−1) with −1<λ<1,
   then the asymptotic L(n)≈log(nlog⁡n)
   implieslimn→+∞L(J,n)=limn→+∞Ln^(λ+1)L(n^)=1.In particular, we have
   ℓ1(n)=2K⋅L2 and ℓ2(n)=−8(n^−3/4L)(1+L/2)K3⋅L5 and ℓm(n)=o1(n−1)m. By a
   similar argument applied
   toK(j;n)≔K(n^+2j)K(n^)=1+∑m≥1km(n)jmm! and B(j;n)≔1+b1(n^+2j)n^+2j1+b1(
   n^)n^=1+∑m≥1βm(n)jmm!,we find that βm(n)=o1(n−1)m+1,
   k1(n)=2(L+1)K⋅L2−2n^(L+2)K2L4, and km(n)=o1(n−1)m for m≥2.

   Let R(j;n) be the approximation for γ(n+j)/γ(n) obtained from [16]. We
   then expand log⁡R(j;n)=:∑m≥1gm(n)jm, with the idea that we will choose
   A(n)∼g1(n) and δ(n)∼−g2(n). To this end, if J=λ(n−1) for −1<λ<1, then a
   calculation reveals
   that−(1+λ)log(1+λ)=limn→+∞log⁡R(J;n)−J⁡lognL24n^2−Jn−1.[17]Therefore,
   gm(n)=O(n−1)1−m, and algebraic manipulations
   giveg1(n)=lognL24n^2+n^ℓ1(n)L+1L−2L+ℓ1(n)⋅L4−k1(n)2+O1n2−ε,g2(n)=−1n^+4
   ℓ1(n)+n^ℓ2(n)L+12L−n^ℓ1(n)2L+22L+O1n2−ε.Using the formulas for
   ℓ1(n), ℓ2(n), and k1(n) above, we
   defineδ(n)≔1n^−2L2⋅K and A(n)≔lognL24n^2+L−1L2⋅K+n^(L+2)L4⋅K2.[18]The
   bounds for the gm(n) and the asymptotics above imply the o(1) error
   term in [15], and also that for sufficiently large n we have 0<δ(n)→0.
   Therefore, Theorem 3 applies, and its corollary gives Theorem 1.

B. Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 2

   Let A(n) and δ(n) be as in [18]. If we
   letJ^γd,n(X)≔δ(n)−dγ(n)⋅Jγd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n))=∑k=0dβkd,nXk,then
   Theorem 1 implies that limn→+∞J^γd,n(X)=Hd(X) =: ∑k=0dhkXk. We have
   confirmed the hyperbolicity of the J^γd,n(X) for n≤106 and 4≤d≤8 using
   Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of ref. 3).

   Using this criterion, we also chose vectors εd≔(εd(d),εd(d−1),…,εd(0))
   of positive numbers and signs sd,sd−1,…,s0∈{±1} for which J^γd,n(X) is
   hyperbolic if 0≤sk(βkd,n−hk)<εd(k) for all k. To make use of these
   inequalities, for positive integers n and 1≤j≤8, define real numbers
   C(n,j) byγ(n+j)γ(n)eA(n)j⋅eδ(n)2j2=1+C(n,j)n3/2.[19]Using an effective
   form of [16], it can be shown^∥ that 0<C(n,j)<14.25 for all n≥7 and
   1≤j≤8. Finally, we determined numbers Mεd for which the required
   inequalities hold for n≥Mεd. The proof follows from the fact that we
   found suitable choices for which Mεd<106.

Example 11:

   We illustrate the case of d=4 using ε4≔(0.041,1.384,0.813,7.313,0.804).
   For n≥100 the odd degree coefficients
   satisfy0<β34,n<28 δ(n) and −145.70δ(n)<β14,n<0,while the even degree
   coefficients
   satisfy1−16.05 δ(n)2<β44,n<1, −12<β24,n<−12+16.20 δ(n), 12−16.01 δ(n)<β
   04,n<12.It turns out that Mε4≔104<106.

6. Examples

   For convenience, we let the J^αd,n(X) denote the polynomials which
   converge to Hd(X) in [5]. We now illustrate Theorem 7 with [6], where
   m=1/24 and k=−1/2. Using [10], we may choose A(n)=2π24n−1−2424n−1 and
   δ(n)=12π(24n−1)3/2−288(24n−1)2. Although the one-term approximations of
   [10] given at the end of Section 3 also satisfy Theorem 3, the two-term
   approximations converge more quickly and better illustrate the result.
   With these data, we observe in Table 3 indeed that the degree 2 and 3
   partition Jensen polynomials are modeled by H2(X)=X2−2 and H3(X)=X3−6X.

Significance

   Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes has treated
   disease in humans. However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to
   nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number
   of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a
   high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA
   that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how
   >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two
   LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs
   codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to
   endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles
   that target new cells.

Abstract

   Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type.
   Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains
   challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method
   to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in
   vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how
   >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into
   functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how
   >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified
   7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA
   (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes,
   distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to
   hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that
   FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.

   A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA therapy targeted to hepatocytes (1, 2)
   has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This
   advance is exciting, but its long-term implications are tempered by the
   fact that clinical LNP therapies have targeted hepatocytes (when
   administered systemically) (1, 3) and muscle (when administered
   locally) (4). In mice, nanoparticles have delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   ribonucleoproteins via systemic or local injection (5⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–12).
   Systemically administered Cas9 delivery to nonliver tissues remains a
   challenge. When LNPs are administered systemically, they display an
   affinity for the liver; this is thought to be driven by natural
   physiological advantages including slow blood flow (13, 14) and
   discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids (15). One additional
   reason most LNPs target the liver may be the process by which they are
   selected. LNPs are screened in vitro before a few LNPs are tested in
   vivo. In vitro LNP delivery can predict in vivo LNP delivery to
   hepatocytes (16), but in vitro nanoparticle can be a poor predictor of
   in vivo delivery to endothelial cells and macrophages (17). Moreover,
   LNP siRNA delivery is often tested in vivo using the FVII assay, which
   predicts hepatocyte delivery; this assay is enhanced by its ease, as
   well as the fact that validated, potent siRNA targeting FVII is
   available (18, 19). It is possible that LNPs target hepatocytes in part
   because established assays select for hepatocyte delivery.

   We reasoned that measuring hundreds of distinct LNPs in vivo would
   provide the best chance of identifying nanoparticles that deliver mRNA
   to new cell types. Using DNA barcodes (17, 20⇓–22), we previously
   quantified how >350 LNPs distributed in vivo. However, biodistribution
   is necessary, but not sufficient, for functional RNA delivery. Over 96%
   of RNA delivered into the endosome of a target cell can be degraded
   (23, 24), and cell-type-specific changes in endosomal escape are not
   understood (25). Thus, it is difficult to predict functional delivery
   using biodistribution. As a result, a high-throughput method to
   quantify functional, cytosolic delivery of mRNA in vivo could
   accelerate the discovery of clinically relevant LNPs.

   An ideal system would (i) enable scientists to test many LNPs
   simultaneously, (ii) utilize commonly available animal models, (iii)
   rely on a robust signal, and (iv) measure functional RNA delivery to
   any combinations of cell types in vivo. Measuring delivery to
   “on-target” cells and “off-target” cells would enable iterative screens
   to improve LNP specificity. We designed a system named Fast
   Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) that meets these
   criteria. FIND measures cytosolic mRNA delivery by >100 LNPs in vivo to
   any combination of cell types. We quantified how >250 LNPs functionally
   delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified two
   formulations that deliver RNA to endothelial beds. FIND is a system
   that facilitates high-throughput screens of functional mRNA delivery
   and may identify LNPs with novel tropisms.

Results

   FIND combined rationally designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox system
   to generate a multiplexed readout of functional mRNA delivery. FIND is
   distinct from previous barcoding systems we developed, which measure
   biodistribution (Fig. 1A). Using high-throughput microfluidics (26), we
   coformulated LNPs with Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. LNP-1, with
   chemical structure 1, carried DNA barcode 1 and Cre mRNA; LNP-N, with
   chemical structure N, carried DNA barcode N and Cre mRNA (Fig. 1 A–C).
   We characterized the size and stability of each LNP using dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and discarded LNPs that did not meet two criteria: (i)
   diameters between 20 and 200 nm and (ii) an autocorrelation curve with
   one inflection point (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). LNPs that met these
   criteria were pooled together and administered to Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato
   (Ai14) mice (27). Ai14 cells fluoresce if Cre mRNA is translated into
   Cre protein, which then translocates to the nucleus and edits target
   DNA. We isolated tdTomato^+ cells with FACS and deep-sequenced the
   cells to identify LNPs that delivered mRNA. We reasoned the codelivery
   of mRNA and a 56-nt ssDNA could approximate the codelivery of an mRNA
   encoding a nuclease and guide RNA (28⇓–30). After sequencing tdTomato^+
   cells (Fig. 1C), we ranked LNPs by calculating the “normalized
   delivery” of each barcode. Normalized delivery is analogous to counts
   per million in RNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
   We used barcodes we previously described and validated with a number of
   control experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C–E) (17, 20, 21).

   FIND is a high-throughput screen for functional mRNA delivery. (A)
   Unlike previous biodistribution screens, which cannot distinguish
   between bound particles, particles stuck in endosomes, and particles
   that delivered RNA into the cytoplasm, FIND identifies LNPs that
   functionally deliver RNA. (B and C) Nanoparticles were formulated to
   carry Cre mRNA and a DNA barcode, before they were administered to Cre
   reporter cell lines or mice. Cells that underwent Cre-mediated genetic
   changes were isolated using FACS, and the DNA barcode was sequenced to
   identify the LNP that delivered the mRNA. (D) LNP barcodes were ranked
   by “normalized delivery”; each sample (e.g., lung 1 vs. heart 1) was
   analyzed individually on a single sequencing run. Using these data, we
   would hypothesize that LNP-1 delivered nucleic acids more efficiently
   to the lungs than LNP-2 and LNP-N. (E) LGSL-R cells were treated with
   naked Cre mRNA or Cre mRNA carrried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K). RFP
   expression indicates cytoplasmic Cre mRNA delivery. (F) Alexa 647 and
   RFP intensities after treatment with L2K carrying Cre mRNA and Alexa
   647-labeled DNA barcode. Compared with untreated cells, there are no
   Alexa 647-RFP+ cells, demonstrating that biodistribution is necessary,
   but not sufficient, for cytoplasmic delivery. (G) RFP+ HEK cells as a
   function of the administered Cre mRNA, which was delivered with L2K.
   (H) Normalized DNA barcode delivery for 54 LNPs sequenced from RFP+ HEK
   cells after the administration of 10 ng or 100 ng total mRNA. A high
   degree of correlation between samples suggests that LNPs which deliver
   mRNA at the first dose deliver mRNA at the second dose. (I) RFP+ HEK
   cells following the administration of 54 LNPs (100 ng total mRNA),
   after cells were treated with endocytosis inhibitors. n = 3–4 wells per
   group. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.

   We characterized FIND using in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, we
   cultured HEK.293 cells that expressed LoxP-GFP-Stop-LoxP-RFP (LGSL-RFP)
   under a CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). These cells became RFP^+ 72 h after
   treatment with Cre mRNA carried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K), but not
   with naked Cre mRNA, which served as the negative control (Fig. 1E and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S1F). The number of RFP^+ cells after L2K treatment
   increased with dose and time, up to 3 d (SI Appendix, Fig. S1G). We
   then coformulated L2K with Cre mRNA and an Alexa 647-labeled DNA
   barcode. After 24 h, 62, 36, 2, and 0% of the cells were 647^+RFP^−,
   647^+RFP^+, 647^−RFP^−, and 647^−RFP^+, respectively. This indicates
   that biodistribution is required, but not sufficient for functional
   cytosolic delivery, as we expected (Fig. 1F). Untreated cells—used to
   control for autofluorescence—were 647^−RFP^− (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix,
   Fig. S1H).

   We then formulated 54 chemically distinct LNPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 I
   and J) carrying Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. We administered the
   LNPs to LGSL-RFP cells with mRNA doses of 10, 100, or 1,000 ng and an
   mRNA:DNA barcode mass ratio of 10:1. We observed a dose-dependent
   increase in RFP^+ cells, with over 80% of the cells RFP^+ 3 d after the
   1,000-ng transfection (Fig. 1G). We sequenced barcodes at all three
   doses, reasoning that barcode delivery at the lowest dose (4% RFP^+
   cells) would predict delivery at the middle dose (20% RFP^+ cells); we
   observed a strong correlation (R^2 > 0.9) between normalized delivery
   at 10-ng and 100-ng doses, suggesting this was the case (Fig. 1H). As a
   control, we sequenced cells treated with 1,000 ng mRNA; in this case,
   the system was saturated (>80% of the cells were RFP^+). As expected,
   the correlation between 1,000 ng and either 10 or 100 ng was weaker (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S1K) than the correlation between the two lower doses;
   importantly, these data indicate that FIND can become saturated as the
   percent of RFP^+ increases. Therefore, varying the dose by the potency
   of the nanoparticles pooled may be critical. We then evaluated whether
   the number of RFP^+ cells decreased after pretreatment with
   chlorpromazine, genistein, or ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), which
   inhibit clathrin-, caveolin-, and macropinocytosis-mediated
   endocytosis, respectively. Compared with control cells that were not
   treated with inhibitors, RFP^+ cells decreased by 40–60%,
   recapitulating results previously obtained with individual LNPs (24,
   31) (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
   FIND could analyze mRNA delivery in vitro.

   We investigated whether FIND could identify nanoparticles that deliver
   mRNA in vivo (Fig. 2 A and B). We formulated 112 LNPs, varying four
   chemical traits that influence LNP delivery in vitro: the lipid-amine
   compound, the molar amount of PEG, the structure of PEG, and the molar
   amount of cholesterol (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).
   Seventy-one LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion and were pooled
   (Fig. 2D). Naked DNA barcode, which should not be delivered as
   efficiently as DNA barcodes in LNPs, was included as a negative
   control. We i.v. injected the pooled LNPs and naked barcode into Ai14
   mice at a 1.5 mg/kg total mRNA dose (average dose 0.021 mg/kg per
   particle). Three days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ lung and kidney
   endothelial cells (tdTomato^+CD31^+CD45^−). Separately, we injected 1.0
   mg/kg total mRNA into mice intramuscularly and isolated immune
   (tdTomato^+CD45^+) and nonimmune (tdTomato^+CD45^−) cells from muscle.
   We gated on PBS-injected Ai14 mice for i.v. injected mice and the
   contralateral limb for intramuscular administration. It was important
   to gate on untreated Ai14 mice instead of C57BL/6J mice; gating on
   C57BL/6J mice could lead to inflated values of tdTomato^+ cells (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2C). Separately, we administered the same LNPs to
   LGSL-RFP cells in vitro. Several lines of evidence suggested the data
   were robust. In all routes of administration, the naked barcode was
   delivered less efficiently than every LNP (Fig. 2E). Second, 7C1-based
   LNPs, which we previously optimized for in vivo RNA delivery (32), were
   enriched in the top 20% LNPs, compared with the other six lipid-amine
   compounds. (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and E). Finally, we reasoned that
   the route of administration would affect delivery; Euclidean
   clustering, a common bioinformatics technique (33) that compares how
   similar/dissimilar groups are to one another, and can be used to study
   nanoparticles in vivo (17, 20), separated intravenous, intramuscular,
   and in vitro delivery into three distinct clusters, as expected (Fig.
   2F).

   are isolated by FACS and DNA barcodes are sequenced. (C) Screen 1
   consisted of a library of 112 distinct LNPs created by formulating
   seven compounds with cholesterol, DOPE, and C14-PEG2000 at 16 different
   mole ratios. (D) DLS analysis of all 112 LNPs from this library; 71
   formed stable LNPs and were included. (E) Normalized DNA delivery in
   kidney and lung endothelial cells (CD31+CD45−) after LNPs were i.v.
   injected, as well as CD45+ and CD45− cells isolated following
   intramuscular injection. (F) In vivo LNP targeting heat map generated
   by unbiased, Euclidean clustering. In vitro LNP delivery, in vivo
   intramuscular delivery, and in vivo i.v. delivery cluster separately,
   as expected.

   We formulated a second LNP library to study how PEG, cholesterol, and
   helper lipids [e.g., dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)] influence
   delivery to cells in vivo. We focused on 7C1-based LNPs, since 7C1 was
   enriched in the first screen. We varied the PEG molar amount, as well
   as the alkyl length on the PEG-lipid (SI Appendix, Fig. S2F).
   Seventy-eight out of 108 LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion; we
   i.v. administered the pool to the mice at a total mRNA dose of 1.5
   mg/kg. Three days later, we sequenced barcodes from tdTomato^+ lung and
   kidney endothelial cells. LNPs containing C[14] alkyl PEG were enriched
   in lung endothelial cells, whereas LNPs containing C[18] alkyl PEG were
   enriched in kidney endothelial cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 G and H). To
   validate the relationship between lung delivery, kidney delivery, and
   PEG structure, we formulated a third LNP library. We formulated 158
   LNPs designed to improve lung delivery relative to kidney delivery by
   only using C[14] alkyl-tail PEG varying helper lipid composition (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2I). We found 3.75 times more lung endothelial cells
   were tdTomato^+ than kidney endothelial cells, a ratio that was
   significantly higher than the second screen (SI Appendix, Fig. S2J), as
   expected. Consistent with previous results (17, 20), we did not observe
   a relationship between LNP size and delivery to endothelial cells
   between the range of 20–200 nm (SI Appendix, Fig. S2K). The poor
   performance of the naked barcode, enrichment of 7C1, the fact that
   unbiased clustering separated the three routes of administration, and
   the PEG data convinced us FIND was capable of quantifying delivery in
   vivo.

   After completing these in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, we
   selected two LNPs (named 7C2 and 7C3) for more thorough
   characterization (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). The
   7C2 was formulated with 7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:18:1 Lyso PC at a
   molar ratio of 50:23.5:6.5:20. The 7C3 was formulated with
   7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:DOPE at a molar ratio of 60:10:25:5. The
   7C2 and 7C3 formed stable LNPs with average diameters between 50 and 80
   nm when formulated with siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), or mRNA (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D). The in vitro endocytosis and functional Cre
   mRNA delivery of both LNPs in LGSL-RFP cells decreased by at least 40%
   when cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine and genistein, relative
   to cells that were not treated with inhibitors. EIPA impacted LNP
   uptake but did not significantly decrease functional delivery in vitro
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H). These results suggest 7C2 and 7C3 are
   endocytosed in vitro via several pathways. To study biodistribution,
   7C2 and 7C3 were formulated with a Cy5.5-conjugated DNA barcode and
   i.v. injected into separate mice at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg DNA. Three
   hours later—a time point that is sufficiently long for LNPs to be
   cleared from the blood (34)—Cy5.5 ex vivo fluorescence, normalized by
   tissue weight, was highest in the spleen, kidney, and liver, suggesting
   7C2 and 7C3 distributed to these tissues (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig.
   S3I).

   Characterization of lead nanoparticles discovered by FIND. (A) The top
   two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, discovered following three rounds of FIND
   are characterized by measuring biodistribution, delivery of siRNA,
   sgRNA. (B) The 7C2 and 7C3 were composed of 7C1 compound, cholesterol,
   C14-PEG2000, and helper lipids, 18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE, respectively.
   (C) Following a 0.75-mg/kg Barcode-Cy5.5 administration,
   biodistribution of 7C2 and 7C3 was quantified and normalized to tissue
   weight. n = 4 miceper group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-way ANOVA. (D)
   Following a 1-mg/kg siICAM2 administration, both 7C2 and 7C3 induced
   ICAM2 protein silencing in endothelial cells by flow cytometry. The 7C2
   demonstrates more robust protein silencing in lung endothelial cells
   than 7C3. n = 4 mice per group. **P < 0.01, two tailed t test. (E–G)
   Following repeat administration of 7C2 and 7C3 at 1.5 mg/kg sgICAM2a
   and sgICAM2b, ICAM2 (E) protein and (F and G) indels were measured in
   endothelial cells isolated from multiple organs using FACS. n = 3–4
   mice per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test.

   We tested whether 7C2 and 7C3 functionally delivered siRNA, sgRNA, and
   mRNA, which are all clinically relevant. We performed our individual
   LNP proof-of-concept experiments with nucleic acids targeting ICAM-2.
   We chose this target for three reasons. First, ICAM-2 is related to a
   number of inflammatory diseases (35, 36). Second, ICAM-2 expression is
   robust on endothelial cells. Third, there is a well-validated
   monoclonal antibody to ICAM-2, which allows us to quantify protein
   expression robustly using FACS.

   First, we formulated the LNPs to carry siRNA targeting ICAM-2. Three
   days after i.v. injecting mice with PBS, 2.0 mg/kg siGFP (a higher dose
   was used to test tolerability), or 1.0 mg/kg siICAM-2, we quantified
   ICAM-2 protein mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in lung, kidney, and
   splenic endothelial cells using flow cytometry (32, 37). Both siRNAs
   were previously validated and chemically modified to reduce
   immunostimulation and promote on-target mRNA degradation (32, 37) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3J). ICAM-2 MFI was constant in PBS- and siGFP-treated
   mice but decreased by 60% in lung endothelial cells isolated from mice
   injected with siICAM-2. The 7C2-mediated delivery of siRNA reduced
   ICAM-2 expression in lung endothelial cells more than in splenic
   endothelial cells, whereas 7C3 silencing was more robust in splenic
   endothelial cells (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3K). Compared with
   PBS-treated mice, mice injected with 2.0 mg/kg siGFP did not show any
   weight loss or changes in organ weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 L–N).

   We then quantified 7C2- and 7C3-mediated sgRNA delivery. We
   coformulated two sgRNAs that were chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′
   termini (38) and injected each at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg into mice that
   constitutively express SpCas9 (39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3O). After three
   injections, ICAM-2 MFI decreased by up to 90, 75, and 59% in lung,
   spleen, and kidney endothelial cells, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3E).
   To confirm protein silencing was mediated by gene editing, we measured
   (40) ICAM-2 insertions and deletions (indels) in lung, spleen, and
   kidney endothelial cells and found between 30 and 70% editing per
   locus, leading to overall ICAM-2 indel percentages of 135, 95, and 123%
   indel, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 P
   and Q). In these experiments, we utilized two sgRNAs per gene; thus,
   the total indel percentage was 200% (100% per site). Compared with PBS
   mice, mice treated with LNPs did not lose weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3
   R and S). Based on these experiments, we concluded that 7C2 potently
   delivered small RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells in vivo.

   In our siRNA and sgRNA experiments, 7C2 outperformed 7C3 and potently
   delivered RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells. We then investigated
   whether the same observations were true for the delivery of large RNAs
   (mRNA). We formulated 7C2 and 7C3 to carry Cre mRNA and injected the
   LNPs into separate mice at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg mRNA (Fig. 4A). Three
   days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ immune cells and endothelial cells
   from the spleen, kidney, heart, lung, and liver, as well as
   hepatocytes. We made two interesting observations. First, contrasting
   the small RNA delivery experiments, 7C3 outperformed 7C2. Second,
   splenic endothelial cells were targeted efficiently (Fig. 4B). Notably,
   relative to splenic endothelial cells, very few immune cells and
   hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 T and U). Given this
   degree of specificity has not been reported to date, we repeated the
   experiment using 34 Ai14 mice over the course of several months. The
   7C3 delivered Cre mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in every experiment
   (Fig. 4C). However, we did observe batch-to-batch variability with
   respect to hepatocyte targeting (Fig. 4 C and D). In 22 of the 34 mice,
   a low percentage of hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (<13%); in 12 of the 34
   mice, we observed high percentages of tdTomato^+ cells. Averaging data
   from all 34 mice, the number of tdTomato^+ splenic endothelial cells
   (43%) was 2.2 times higher than the number of tdTomato^+ hepatocytes
   (20%) (Fig. 4D). Splenic endothelial cell delivery was also
   dose-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3V). The variable delivery to
   hepatocytes was unlikely to be driven by toxicity; throughout our
   studies, we injected 34 mice with 7C3 and did not observe changes in
   mouse weight or obvious signs of toxicity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3W). We
   were unable to identify the source of batch variability; however, we
   hypothesize it is driven by the polymeric backbone of 7C3 and the
   resulting heterogenous chemical structure. Our data strongly suggest
   that future FIND screens should focus on compounds with defined
   chemical structures, which may be less likely to exhibit biological
   heterogeneity. The data also demonstrate that 7C3 can efficiently
   deliver mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, the 7C2
   and 7C3 formulations both included the lipomer 7C1 but had variable
   molar compositions of helper lipids (18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE), which
   distinguished them chemically from previously described
   endothelial-targeting nanoparticles. The differences in delivery
   between 7C2 and 7C3 provide interesting preliminary evidence that
   suggests changing the composition of helper lipids added to a given
   ionizable amine can alter tropism. The compositions and efficacy of 7C2
   and 7C3 are included in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.

   eight experiments of tdTomato+ splenic endothelial cells and

   (E) Indel percentage in splenic ECs following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.
   (F) Indel percentage in hepatocytes following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.

   Given the difference between small and large RNA delivery, we
   quantified how LNPs codelivered CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. We
   formulated Cas9 mRNA and two guides targeting ICAM-2 into LNPs at a 3:1
   mass ratio and injected a 2.0 mg/kg total i.v. on day 0 and 2. On day
   7, we isolated endothelial cells from the spleen, lung, kidney, and
   liver, as well as hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Splenic
   endothelial cell editing mediated by 7C3 was more robust than editing
   in hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). Mice injected with 7C2 and 7C3
   did not lose weight, compared with PBS-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S5C). These studies were also conducted with sgRNAs that were
   chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini (38); during the course of
   the experiments, two groups demonstrated that heavily modified sgRNAs
   improved in vivo editing (7, 8). We redesigned sgICAM2b with “enhanced”
   modifications (8) (referred to as e-sgICAM2) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D)
   and formulated 7C3 to carry Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2. Given that
   e-sgICAM2 was more likely to resist degradation in vivo (8), we
   hypothesized that the optimal mass ratio of Cas9 mRNA:sgRNA would
   decrease from 3:1, which is the optimized ratio with minimally
   stablized sgRNAs. To test this, we formulated 7C3 with Cas9
   mRNA:e-sgRNA ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1, keeping the total injected
   dose constant at 2.0 mg/kg. After injecting mice i.v. with 2.0 mg/kg
   total RNA (Cas9 mRNA + sgRNA) on days 0 and 2, we isolated splenic
   endothelial cells and hepatocytes using FACS on day 7. We observed gene
   editing in splenic endothelial cells and hepatocytes at all
   mRNA-to-sgRNA ratios, with an average of 20% editing in the 1:1 mass
   ratio group (Fig. 4 E and F). As expected, the lower Cas9 mRNA:e-sgRNA
   mass ratio led to increased editing. Once again, mice injected with 7C3
   did not lose weight compared with PBS-treated controls (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S5E). This is a demonstration of systemic Cas9-mediated editing of
   endothelial cells in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that
   systemically administered nanoparticles can edit endothelial cells, and
   that the ideal Cas9:sgRNA ratio will depend on the relative stability
   of the two molecules.

Discussion

   FIND is a high-throughput method to quantify functional mRNA delivery
   mediated by LNPs. The distinction between biodistribution and
   functional delivery is significant; >96% of delivered RNA does not
   escape the endosome (23, 24), and endosomal escape may vary with cell
   type or disease state (41), making it hard to predict functional
   delivery using biodistribution. Notably, Cre mRNA must be translated in
   the cytoplasm, translocate into the nucleus, and edit target DNA. The
   similarity between these steps and the steps required for
   nuclease-mediated gene editing is one reason we selected a Cre-based
   FIND system. We also chose the Cre-lox system because Ai14 mice are
   well-validated and commonly available (27). Moreover, the Cre-mediated
   signal is strong and does not vary dramatically with time; by contrast,
   a GFP-based system would have a signal that varies hour by hour, making
   FACS gates impossible to interpret during a long experimental day.

   Although we focused on endothelial cells, FIND is agnostic to cell
   type; we envision FIND studies that identify LNPs targeting other
   cells. Ai14 mice have recently been used to monitor LNP-mediated
   delivery to immune populations at a cellular resolution (42). Given
   that on- and off-target cells can be isolated from the same mouse, FIND
   may also be used to identify (or iteratively evolve) LNPs with high
   therapeutic windows. To further increase the ratio of splenic
   endothelial cell:hepatocyte delivery, we could incorporate
   endothelial-cell-targeting ligands (43, 44).

   More generally, this ability to study how hundreds of LNPs target
   combinations of cells in vivo may elucidate relationships between LNP
   structure and in vivo functional delivery. In this case, FIND enabled
   us to quickly identify two lead LNPs. Here we delivered sgRNAs
   targeting the inflammation-related gene ICAM-2. However, the long-term
   utility of FIND will be defined by its ability to identify
   nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing more efficiently than the
   current gold standard, which is in vitro screening. Relatedly, to fully
   utilize the large in vivo datasets generated by FIND, efforts will need
   to be made to develop high-throughput ways of characterizing LNP
   characterizations zeta-potential, pK[a], and lipid bilayer structure.
   We believe that, in time, these advances will help position FIND to
   help facilitate the discovery of structure–activity relationships to
   nonliver tissues. In future studies, it will also be important to
   further improve the efficiency of gene editing in endothelial cells
   beyond 20%.

   We did not observe noticeable experimental variability within a given
   FIND screening experiment. We quantified the consistency of the
   sequencing readouts by analyzing the normalized DNA delivery values
   between bioreplicates. In all cell types, in each of the three screens,
   there were no overt differences between bioreplicates, suggesting the
   precision of the sequencing was high (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In
   individual LNP testing, we did observe variability in hepatocyte
   delivery when 7C3 was administered over several batches to a total of
   34 mice. Notably, delivery to splenic ECs was consistent, as was the
   (lack of) delivery to all other tested cell types. We were unable to
   identify the chemical variations that led to batch variability in
   hepatocyte targeting. Two possibilities that will require further
   investigation include variable LNP chemical structure and variable mRNA
   activity. Performing FIND screens with well-defined compounds could
   minimize batch-to-batch variability.

   We note that when testing many new LNPs batch variability may be
   observed since the formulations are not yet optimized. However, this
   issue is not related to FIND or to pooled LNP screens; it is just as
   likely to occur when LNPs are tested individually. We believe FIND may
   actually minimize unwanted error in two ways. First, Cre-based
   reporters quantify delivery at the level of cell type. Identifying the
   cell type with batch issues is much easier than with two common
   approaches used in the field today: mRNA encoding luciferase or
   erythropoietin, which quantifies protein production at the tissue- and
   organism-level, respectively. Second, when nanoparticles are screened
   individually, missed injections, small changes in time points, mouse
   age, and other variables can introduce “silent” experimental
   variability that affects how LNP1 performs, relative to LNP2. Here, we
   inject all of the nanoparticles into the same mouse, which helps to
   reduce these sources of unintentional experimental variance. At the
   same time, FIND has several important limitations. LNPs must be stable
   and must be well-tolerated. Like all DNA-based screens, it is
   imperative to prevent DNA contamination.

   Finally, we note that the doses of mRNA or gene editing constructs that
   are well-tolerated after systemic administration to patients has not
   yet been established. In one related example, the FDA approved ONPATTRO
   therapeutic, which is an siRNA systemically administered in an LNP, at
   a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. This may provide an initial estimate of the mRNA
   doses that are tolerated in the clinic. However, Cas9 mRNA is >100
   times larger than a single siRNA duplex (∼4,500-nt ssRNA vs. 21-nt
   dsRNA). As a result, there is still a need to further improve the
   potency of the drug delivery systems as well as the mRNA drugs to
   advance novel Cas9 therapies into the clinic. Despite these caveats,
   FIND is a robust method to quantify how hundreds of LNPs deliver mRNA
   to any combination of cell types in vivo. We believe FIND is
   well-positioned to help identify LNPs with novel tropisms, which could
   lead to improved nonliver RNA drugs.

Materials and Methods

Nanoparticle Formulation.

   Nanoparticles were formulated using a microfluidic device as previously
   described (26). Briefly, nucleic acids (mRNA, DNA barcodes, siRNA, and
   sgRNA) were diluted in 10 mM citrate buffer (Teknova) while lipid-amine
   compounds, alkyl-tailed PEG, cholesterol, and helper lipids were
   diluted in ethanol. For nanoparticle screens, Cre mRNA and DNA barcodes
   were mixed at a 10:1 mass ratio. Citrate and ethanol phases were
   combined in a microfluidic device by syringes (Hamilton Company) at a
   flow rate of 600 µL/min and 200 µL/min, respectively. All PEGs,
   cholesterol, and helper lipids were purchased from Avanti Lipids.

DNA Barcoding.

   Each chemically distinct LNP was formulated to carry its own unique DNA
   barcode (Fig. 1). For example, LNP1 carried DNA barcode 1, while the
   chemically distinct LNP2 carried DNA barcode 2. DNA barcodes were
   designed rationally with several characteristics, as we previously
   described (20). Fifty-six- nucleotide-long ssDNA sequences were
   purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The two nucleotides on the
   5′ and 3′ ends of the 56-nt ssDNA were modified with phosphorothioates
   to reduce exonuclease degradation and improve DNA barcode stability. To
   ensure equal amplification of each sequence, we included universal
   forward and reverse primer regions on all barcodes. To monitor for PCR
   bias, each barcode was also designed with seven random nucleotides.
   Each barcode was distinguished using a unique 8-bp sequence. An 8-bp
   sequence can generate over 4^8 (65,536) distinct barcodes. We used 240
   distinct 8-bp sequences designed by to prevent sequence bleaching on
   the Illumina MiniSeq sequencing machine.

Nanoparticle Characterization.

   LNP hydrodynamic diameter was measured using high-throughput DLS
   (DynaPro Plate Reader II; Wyatt). LNPs were diluted in sterile 1× PBS
   to a concentration of ∼0.06 μg/mL and analyzed. To avoid using unstable
   LNPs, and to enable sterile purification using a 0.22-μm filter, LNPs
   were included only if they met three criteria: diameter >20 nm,
   diameter <200 nm, and correlation function with one inflection point.
   Particles that met these criteria were dialyzed with 1× PBS
   (Invitrogen) and were sterile-filtered with a 0.22-μm filter.

Cell Culture.

   In vitro experiments were performed using HEK.293 cells (GenTarget)
   stably transduced with a CMV-lox-GFP-stop-lox-RFP construct cultured in
   DMEM/F-12 50/50 media (Corning) supplemented by 10% (vol/vol) FBS (VWR)
   and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin–streptomycin (VWR). Cells were seeded in a
   six-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well; 24 h later, LNPs
   were added with a total mRNA dose of 100 ng. Six hours after
   transfection, media was refreshed. DNA was isolated using 50 μL of
   QuickExtract (EpiCentre).

Endocytosis Inhibition.

   For experiments shown in Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H, cells
   were incubated with endocytosis inhibitors. Specifically, 1 h before
   incubation with pooled LNPs, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated
   endocytosis (chlorpromazine, 100 μM; Alfa Aesar), caveolae-mediated
   endocytosis (genistein, 100μM; TCI America), and macropinocytosis
   [5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) Amiloride, EIPA, 50 μM; Toronto Research
   Chemicals] were added to cells.

Animal Experiments.

   All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Georgia
   Institute of Technology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
   LSL-Tomato (007914), C57BL/6J (000664), and constitutive SpCas9
   (026179) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and used
   between 5–12 wk of age. In all experiments, we used n = 3–5 mice per
   group. Mice were injected i.v. via the lateral tail vein or
   intramuscularly into the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and
   gastrocnemius. The nanoparticle concentration was determined using
   NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). For in vivo nanoparticle screens, mice
   were administered 1.5 mg/kg for intravascular and 1 mg/kg for
   intramuscular administration. The dosing schedule for each experiment
   is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7.

Cell Isolation and Staining.

   Cells were isolated 72 h after injection with LNPs unless otherwise
   noted. Mice were perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS through the right
   atrium. Tissues were finely cut and then placed in a digestive enzyme
   solution with collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), collagenase XI
   (Sigma-Aldrich), and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C at 550 rpm
   for 45 min. The digestive enzyme for heart and spleen included
   collagenase IV (32, 37, 45). Cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm
   mesh and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were stained to identify
   specific cell populations and sorted using the BD FacsFusion and BD
   Facs Aria IIIu cell sorters in the Georgia Institute of Technology
   Cellular Analysis Core. For in vitro experiments, BD Accuri C6 and BD
   FacsFusion were used. The antibody clones used were anti-CD31 (390;
   BioLegend), anti-CD45.2 (104; BioLegend), and anti-CD102 (3C4;
   BioLegend). PE anti-mCD47 (miap301; BioLegend) was used for tdTomato
   compensation. Representative flow gates are located in SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8. PBS-injected Ai14 mice were used to gate tdTomato populations
   for i.v. administration, while contralateral limbs were used to gate
   for intramuscular experiments.

Biodistribution.

   LNPs encapsulating Cy5.5-tagged DNA barcode were administered at 0.75
   mg/kg. After 3 h, tissues were isolated without perfusion, weighed
   individually, and imaged using the Licor Odyssey CLx imaging system.
   Signal intensity was normalized to tissue weight.

Endothelial RNA interference.

   C57BL/6J mice were injected with 7C2 and 7C3 with PBS, 2 mg/kg siCTRL
   (siGFP-647) (AxoLabs), or 1 mg/kg siICAM2 (AxoLabs). In all cases,
   siRNAs were chemically modified at the 2′ position to increase
   stability and negate immunostimulation. Both siGFP and siICAM2
   sequences have been previously reported several times (32, 37, 45).
   Seventy-two hours after injection, tissues were isolated and protein
   expression was determined via flow cytometry. ICAM2 MFI in PBS-treated
   mice was normalized to 100%, and all treated groups were compared with
   this control group.

Endothelial Gene Editing.

   Mice constitutively expressing SpCas9 were injected three times with
   7C2 or 7C3 carrying 1.5 mg/kg of two chemically modified sgRNAs with
   thee nucleotides modified on the 5′ and 5′ ends (TriLink
   Biotechnologies) targeting ICAM2 (sgICAM2ab) (1:1 mass ratio).
   Separately, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg with 7C2
   and 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and sgICAM2ab at a 3:1 mass ratio. Five days after the
   last injection, tissues were isolated, and ICAM2 protein expression was
   measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells were sorted into
   QuickExtract. Next, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg
   with 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and e-sgICAM2 (AxoLabs) at a 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 mass
   ratio. Five days after the last injection, tissues were isolated, and
   ICAM2 protein expression was measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells
   were sorted into QuickExtract. Indel formation was measured by TIDE
   (https://www.deskgen.com/landing/tide.html).

Tissue Immunostaining.

   Excised organs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron
   Microscopy Systems) in PBS. Tissues were washed twice in PBS and
   cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS until the organs sank to the bottom
   of the container. Organs were then embedded in optimal cutting
   temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned (10 μm) onto
   slides. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides for 10 min in a
   pressure cooker using low-pH antigen-retrieval solution (Life
   Technologies). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
   (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) before being
   blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in
   PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated with anti-VE cadherin (BV13;
   Biolegend), diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. After three
   washes with PBS, sections were incubated at RT with Alexa Flour 647
   conjugated donkey anti-rat (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 2 h.
   After two PBS washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life
   Technologies), and coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Life
   Technologies).

Microscopy.

   Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera on a
   PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope mounted to a
   Zeiss Axiovert 200M body. Single-cell images were acquired using
   Volocity (PerkinElmer) with Z-stacks taken in 0.2-μm increments with a
   63× N.A. 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Stitched images were acquired
   using a 20× N.A. 0.8 objective with an automated XY stage (ASI)
   controlled by Volocity and set to 20% overlap. All images were linearly
   contrast enhanced.

PCR Amplification.

   All samples were amplified and prepared for sequencing using a one-step
   PCR protocol as previously described (20). More specifically, 1 μL of
   primers (5 μM for final reverse/forward, 0.5 μM for base forward) were
   added to 5 μL of Kapa HiFi 2× master mix, and 4 μL template DNA/water.
   The reaction was run for 30 cycles. When the PCR did not produce clear
   bands, the primer concentrations, DNA template input, PCR temperature,
   and number of cycles were optimized for individual samples.

Deep Sequencing.

   Illumina deep sequencing was conducted in Georgia Institute of
   Technology’s Molecular Evolution core. Runs were performed on an
   Illumina Miniseq. Primers were designed based on Nextera XT adapter
   sequences.

Data Normalization.

   Counts for each particle, per tissue, were normalized to the barcoded
   LNP mixture we injected into the mouse. This “input” DNA provided the
   DNA counts and was used to normalize DNA counts from the cells and
   tissues.

Data Analysis and Statistics.

   Sequencing results were processed using a custom Python-based tool to
   extract raw barcode counts for each tissue. These raw counts were then
   normalized with an R script prior for further analysis. Statistical
   analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 7; more specifically, one-tailed
   t test or one-way ANOVAs were used where appropriate. Data are plotted
   as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Significance

   Jawless, boneless, and virtually without fossil record, hagfish have
   long escaped systematists’ grip on their place among other fish. Yet
   their systematic resolution is critical to define vertebrates as a
   clade. Here we report an unequivocal fossil hagfish from the Cretaceous
   Mediterranean. Using this fossil to calibrate the evolutionary history
   of the group, our analysis supports hagfish and lampreys as sister
   groups, which likely diverged from one another in early Paleozoic
   times. As a result, vertebrates have a deep dichotomy, where some
   fossil jawless vertebrates sit closer to hagfish and lampreys than to
   jawed vertebrates. We showed that morphology-based analysis converged
   onto molecular inferences when characters are coded nonindependently,
   providing a case study for morphological–molecular conflicts in animal
   phylogeny.

Abstract

   Hagfish depart so much from other fishes anatomically that they were
   sometimes considered not fully vertebrate. They may represent: (i) an
   anatomically primitive outgroup of vertebrates (the morphology-based
   craniate hypothesis); or (ii) an anatomically degenerate vertebrate
   lineage sister to lampreys (the molecular-based cyclostome hypothesis).
   This systematic conundrum has become a prominent case of conflict
   between morphology- and molecular-based phylogenies. To date, the
   fossil record has offered few insights to this long-branch problem or
   the evolutionary history of hagfish in general, because unequivocal
   fossil members of the group are unknown. Here, we report an unequivocal
   fossil hagfish from the early Late Cretaceous of Lebanon. The soft
   tissue anatomy includes key attributes of living hagfish: cartilages of
   barbels, postcranial position of branchial apparatus, and chemical
   traces of slime glands. This indicates that the suite of characters
   unique to living hagfish appeared well before Cretaceous times. This
   new hagfish prompted a reevaluation of morphological characters for
   interrelationships among jawless vertebrates. By addressing
   nonindependence of characters, our phylogenetic analyses recovered
   hagfish and lampreys in a clade of cyclostomes (congruent with the
   cyclostome hypothesis) using only morphological data. This new
   phylogeny places the fossil taxon within the hagfish crown group, and
   resolved other putative fossil cyclostomes to the stem of either
   hagfish or lamprey crown groups. These results potentially resolve the
   morphological–molecular conflict at the base of the Vertebrata. Thus,
   assessment of character nonindependence may help reconcile
   morphological and molecular inferences for other major discords in
   animal phylogeny.

   Hagfish and lampreys (cyclostomes) represent the only living lineages
   of jawless vertebrates (or agnathans) (1). Cyclostomes are generally
   considered primitive morphologically with respect to jawed vertebrates
   (gnathostomes) (1, 2). However, consensus is still lacking about
   cyclostome relationships. None of the traits proposed to unite hagfish
   and lampreys sets them apart clearly from extinct lineages of jawless
   vertebrates (3, 4). Furthermore, characters distribute asymmetrically.
   Hagfish have fewer traits than lampreys in common with gnathostomes,
   and are characterized by rudimentary state or absence of otherwise
   pan-vertebrate traits such as electroreceptors or taste buds (5, 6).
   Thus, resolving the cyclostome relationships holds direct implications
   for defining the vertebrate crown group, and for describing early
   character evolution in that clade. Motivated by this prospect, a number
   of analyses have set out to clarify positions of hagfish and lampreys
   with respect to gnathostomes.

   The endeavor has generated variants of four main topological schemes
   (Fig. 1 A–D). Early classifications split vertebrates between agnathans
   and gnathostomes, with cyclostomes nested within the former (Fig. 1A)
   (7). With the advent of cladistics, this dichotomy was challenged:
   hagfish fell outside the vertebrate node, rendering cyclostomes
   paraphyletic (craniate hypothesis; Fig. 1B) (8). More recent analyses
   of morphological data continue to support the paraphyly, but differ
   from the earlier analyses in placing fossil agnathans on the
   gnathostome stem (Fig. 1D) (9⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–16). Meanwhile, cyclostome
   paraphyly has been contested by molecular phylogenetics, which nearly
   unanimously favor cyclostomes as a clade (cyclostome hypothesis; Fig.
   1C) (17, 18). Thus, the controversy has been locked in a stalemate
   between the molecular inferences for cyclostome monophyly (Fig. 1C) and
   the morphologically supported cyclostome paraphyly (Fig. 1D).

   A summary of hypotheses for cyclostome relationships. The hypotheses
   differ in cyclostome monophyly or paraphyly (columns), and about
   relationships of fossil “agnathans” with respect to the cyclostome and
   gnathostome crowns (rows). Blue box = support from morphological data;
   red box = support from molecular data. Yellow box = compatible with
   both data types. (A) Noncladistic classification schemes based on
   morphological data with cyclostomes nested among agnathans. (B)
   Craniate hypothesis in early cladistic analyses based on morphological
   data, where hagfish and fossil agnathans become nested outside the
   crown vertebrate node. (C) Cyclostome hypothesis as supported by
   molecular data. Fossil agnathans are assumed on the gnathostome stem.
   (D) Craniate hypothesis in recent analyses of morphological data, where
   hagfish remain nested outside the crown vertebrate node. Fossil
   agnathans are placed on the gnathostome stem. (E) Updated cyclostome
   hypothesis supported by the analyses of morphological data presented in
   this paper. Hagfish and lampreys form a clade of cyclostomes as
   supported by the molecular inferences. However, some fossil agnathans
   are closer to the cyclostome crown than to the gnathostome crown.

   Despite the ever more complete molecular datasets, consensus has not
   been achieved. This is because (i) monophyly is an anticipated outcome
   of long-branch attraction in molecular data; and (ii) fossil taxa that
   potentially break up the long branches are only accessible via
   morphological data. Interpretations of character polarities are
   radically different between the two topologies. The
   morphology-supported paraphyly implies rudimentary state or absence of
   traits in hagfish as primitive (8). For the monophyly, molecular trees
   are agnostic about character polarities, but the rudiments and absence
   in hagfish tend to be interpreted as secondary (2, 3). An equally
   parsimonious alternative— hagfish as primitive and lampreys and
   gnathostomes as convergent—is rarely discussed (2). As such, cyclostome
   relationships provide a classic example of long-branch problems
   hindering morphological–molecular congruence.

   Although fossils are critical in reducing branch lengths, the patchy
   fossil record of cyclostomes remains a formidable challenge. For
   hagfish (myxinoids), three soft-bodied Carboniferous forms
   (Gilpichthys, Myxineidus, and Myxinikela) have each been posited as a
   stem myxinoid (19⇓–21), but myxinoid affinities for the former two have
   been questioned (9, 22, 23). Myxinikela is the sole putative myxinoid
   with any degree of cladistic support (9), but its similarities to
   living hagfish may partly be artifacts of preservation (23). As these
   Carboniferous forms are only preserved with a handful of morphological
   structures, the inferences have been based on a few myxinoid- or
   cyclostome-diagnostic characters (potential keratinous teeth in
   Gilpichthys; a longitudinally elongate nasohypophyseal system in
   Myxinikela) and the general absence of lamprey-like traits (e.g., oral
   funnel, discrete dorsal fins) (19⇓–21). Consequently, living hagfishes
   imply long ghost lineages, making it difficult to interpret the
   peculiar morphology of the group. Here, we report an unequivocal
   hagfish fossil from the Late Cretaceous of Lebanon—which reduces this
   gap in the fossil record by 100 My—and present an updated
   morphology-based phylogeny of cyclostomes. We also describe the
   exquisitely preserved soft-tissue anatomy of this new hagfish using
   trace elements mapped by synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence
   (SRS-XRF; described in Methods and SI Appendix, Part B).

Etymology.

   The generic name is derived from “Tethys” after the Tethys Sea and
   “myxinos” (Latinized Greek for “slimy fish”). The specific name is
   derived from “tapirus” (Latinized Old Tupi for tapir) and “rostrum” (a
   Latin root for snout) for the elongated tapering snout.

Horizon and Locality.

   The type specimen was collected from sublithographic limestones of
   Hâdjula Lagerstätte (Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous), 10 km east of
   Byblos, Lebanon. The locality is interpreted as an interreef basin on a
   carbonate platform (24). See SI Appendix, Part A for detailed
   information on provenance and geological settings.

Diagnosis.

   Tethymyxine tapirostrum is a myxinoid exhibiting the following unique
   combination of characters: tapering nasohypophyseal profile; tentacular
   cartilage not extending beyond nasohypophyseal aperture; prebranchial
   length nearly equal to branchial length; 8 pairs of branchial pouches;
   133 slime glands on one side; and caudal fin not expanded into a round
   lobe.

Description and Comparisons.

   In visible light, BHI 6445 (Fig. 2) is preserved in full-body outline
   with soft tissues (body length = 313 mm). The trunk lies on its left
   side, whereas the head was twisted counterclockwise to expose the
   ventral side. The preserved tissues are marked by greater abundance of
   P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn relative to the surrounding matrix (Fig. 2C and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These tissues are inferred to be (i) composed of
   collagenous extracellular matrix (e.g., chondrocranium); (ii) enclosed
   by a highly vascularized epithelial sheet (e.g., branchial pouches,
   livers); or (iii) secreted keratin (e.g., infillings of slime glands,
   tooth-like apparatus). The original outline of the body is clearly
   demarcated from the matrix in most elements mapped by SRS-XRF (Fig. 2C
   and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Al, P, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and As are
   markedly more abundant in the preserved tissues than in the matrix,
   whereas the reverse is true for Si, Ca, and Hg. The preservation of
   structures and imprints is partly obscured by glue and paint, but the
   fossilized tissues can be distinguished from artifacts. Optically, the
   structural preservation is distinguished by surface topography under
   the artifacts. In SRS-XRF, the artifacts are clearly differentiated
   from the fossil and matrix based on distributions of S, Ti, V, and Fe.
   In particular, X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals differential
   distributions of sulfur species in this specimen (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S4). Sulfate is the dominant species in all residues; organic sulfur is
   present in both the fossil and matrix, but virtually absent in the glue
   (SI Appendix, Part B). This result highlights the utility of SRS-XRF in
   identifying curatorial artifacts in fossil specimens.

   The preservation of decay-prone soft tissues such as branchial pouches
   and slime (Fig. 2) suggests that BHI 6445 was rapidly buried (25).
   Although the mode of preservation is similar to that of the Early
   Cretaceous freshwater lamprey Mesomyzon from the Jehol Group of China,
   internal structures of BHI 6445 are not obscured by the preserved
   integument and muscles as in specimens of Mesomyzon (26) (for detailed
   discussion, see SI Appendix, Part A).

   The overall characteristics clearly reject nonmyxinoid hypotheses for
   the identity of BHI 6445. The absence of a mineralized skeleton, paired
   fins, and jaws rules out anguilliform gnathostomes like the coeval eel
   Luenchelys (27). BHI 6445 is not a lamprey either, because it does not
   have an oral sucker, tectal cartilages, branchial basket, dorsal fins,
   and other skeletal and proportional features of lampreys that would
   have been present given the state of preservation (25). Instead, BHI
   6445 has characters diagnostic of myxinoids, including an elongate
   nasohypophyseal portion of the chondrocranium, posteriorly placed
   branchial pouches, and slime glands.

   Tethymyxine has a small head relative to its body size. The
   prebranchial length of BHI 6445 is shorter than that in living
   hagfishes, relative to the total body length (13% versus 20–30%) (28).
   As a consequence, the first branchial pouch sits more anteriorly than
   in living hagfish species, leaving a relatively short space for the
   lingual apparatus to occupy. The snout tapers toward the
   nasohypophyseal aperture (nostril). The nasohypophyseal barbels are
   preserved with the sigmoidal tentacular cartilage on the left side of
   BHI 6445. The barbels sit behind the aperture as in living Rubicundus
   (29) (Fig. 3 B and C), but the specimen differs from it in lacking a
   protruded nasohypophyseal tube. The tentacular cartilage is fused
   posteriorly with the lateral element of the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Both the left and right parts of the keratinous tooth
   plates are preserved in association with the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Although several cusps can be identified by the
   distributions of Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Hg (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), precise
   cusp number and shape cannot be determined. Unlike the preservation of
   comb-like tooth plates in Gilpichthys from Mazon Creek (20), the plates
   may have been pyrolysated in BHI 6445 as seen in the scales of
   actinopterygians from the same locality (27). Presumably the missing
   counterpart of BHI 6445 has the rest of preserved chondrocranial
   elements.

   showing cyclostome relationships. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   inferences converged onto each other in placing Tethymyxine within the
   hagfish crown group and supporting cyclostome monophyly. The precise
   topology is from the maximum parsimony analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
   Node ages represent median of 95% HPD distribution in a Bayesian
   molecular clock analysis of mitogenomic sequences (16S and COI) under
   fossilized birth–death model (see SI Appendix, Fig. S9 for a fully
   calibrated maximum clade credibility tree with node intervals). The
   crown group of cyclostomes is united by at least two morphological
   characters (shown on each stem): keratinous tooth plates (yellow) and
   periocular position of trunk muscles (red). At Top Right, the
   nasohypophyseal profiles are compared in ventral view among three
   selected crown-group hagfishes (B: Tethymyxine tapirostrum; C,
   Rubicundus eos; D, Eptatretus stoutii; the latter two based on ref.
   29). To show morphological divergence among the three major crown
   groups of living vertebrates (E, myxinoids; F, petromyzontiforms; G,
   gnathostomes), each is accompanied by a chondrocranium in left lateral
   view (green: neural crest-derived nasohypophyseal skeleton; red:

   Tethymyxine has eight pairs of branchial pouches. This number is
   greater than in Rubicundus spp. (n = 5) and most other living hagfishes
   (n = 4∼7), equal to some species of Eptatretus and Nemamyxyne, and
   smaller than in some species of Eptatretus (n = 14 in E. polytrema)
   (28). A structure immediately behind the branchial series is
   topographically and morphologically consistent with a heart, which has
   Fe in higher abundance than in the surrounding tissues (Fig. 2 D and
   E). The intestine extends between the anterior and posterior liver
   lobes. These visceral tissues have different textures and colors that
   allow clear delineation under natural light (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
   However, the element mapping by SRS-XRF shows similar compositions
   among these tissues. P, S, and Cl appear to have greater abundances in
   the branchial pouches than in the intestine, and Ca seems to be the
   reverse (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

   A characteristic unique to hagfish, slime glands are preserved in an
   uninterrupted series of infillings that extends nearly the entire
   length of the body on the ventral side. The infillings are
   distinguished from other tissues by surface profile, high Ca, P, and S
   abundances, and higher levels of Cl, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Hg
   relative to the matrix (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and
   Table S1). The chemical mapping is consistent with the fact that a
   major component of hagfish slime is tightly coiled, mucin-coated
   α-keratin threads (30)—pyrolysates of which are characterized by
   calcium phosphatic content (31). The number of the slime glands (n =
   133 on the right) is greater than in most living hagfishes (n =
   70∼110), but close to that of R. eos (n = 128∼130) (28). The end of the
   tail is obscured by paint, but it is possible to outline the body by
   relatively high concentrations of Cu, P, S, and Fe (contained in paint,
   but higher in preserved tissues) and relatively low concentrations of
   Ca (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 and Table S1). The
   notochord is difficult to identify optically (as it is generally in
   fossils of soft-bodied vertebrates), but can be delineated with the
   high P and S concentrations along the dorsal midline (SI Appendix,
   Figs. S3 and S4 B and C). The tail tapers rather than expanding into a
   round lobe.

Phylogenetics.

   We generated a morphological dataset to test the relationships of
   Tethymyxine and cyclostomes. Tethymyxine has myxinoid apomorphies not
   identified in other fossil taxa. These traits include the posteriorly
   placed branchial series and slime glands, which are absent, missing, or
   ambiguous in Myxinikela and other putative fossil cyclostomes (9). To
   code these unequivocal and potential myxinoids in a phylogenetic
   dataset, we reevaluated morphological characters that are
   nonindependent, and enhanced contingency coding to reduce implicit
   weighting (32). For example, attributes of a mineralized skeleton such
   as bones and scales are not simply absent in the soft-bodied myxinoids.
   Those characters are inapplicable in this lineage. Applying no
   character values to attributes of biomineralization in myxinoids
   removes additive weight of lacking mineralization in every coded
   skeletal element. This contingency coding eliminated, on average, 70%
   of character information from nonvertebrate outgroups and 32% from
   cyclostomes, which would otherwise be available to coding (SI Appendix,
   Parts B–D and Fig. S5 for comparative analysis).

   Searches of this dataset, using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   methods, resolved Tethymyxine within the myxinoid crown group, sister
   to species of the living genus Rubicundus (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6–S8). These two genera with an elongate snout, indented
   barbels, and a large number of slime glands (>100) (Fig. 3 B and C)
   were nested outside the clade of more conventional living myxinoids
   (Eptatretus, Myxine, and Neomyxine) (Fig. 3D). Myxinikela was resolved
   as a stem myxinoid, whereas other Carboniferous forms (Gilpichthys,
   Hardistiella, Mayomyzon, and Myxineidus) and Priscomyzon were found
   along the stem of lampreys. Under maximum parsimony, the crown group of
   cyclostomes is united by two unambiguous character changes: keratinous
   tooth plates and migration of postotic myomeres to position of eyes
   (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S3). Euconodonts, Pipiscius, and
   anaspids fell into the cyclostome stem. Together, these lineages
   comprised the total group of cyclostomes. Controversial Cambrian forms
   (Haikouella, Haikouichthys, Metaspriggina, and Myllokunmingia) were
   resolved in the vertebrate stem.

   Given the topology obtained in the maximum parsimony analysis, and
   using the fossil-calibrated dataset of mitogenomic sequences, tip-dated
   Bayesian estimates of divergence placed the crown cyclostome node from
   the earliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) to Early Silurian (Wenlockian)
   times [95% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 536.31–428.44 Mya]
   with median near the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary (485.57 Mya) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S9). Both the myxinoid and petromyzontiform crowns were
   estimated to have their origins in Mesozoic times, with the myxinoid
   estimates straddling the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary (95% HPD:
   183.95–103.30 Mya; median: 138.59 Mya) and with the petromyzontiform
   estimates within the Jurassic times (95% HPD: 194.84–163.14 Mya;
   median: 169.82 Mya).

Discussion

   Tethymyxine is significant as being the sole fossil of the crown group
   Myxinoidea. It therefore provides a crucial calibration point for the
   evolution of the myxinoid clade as well as the distinctive morphology
   of the group. In our dataset, the myxinoid topologies were robust to
   altered character coding schemes (assuming taphonomic artifacts) or
   different taxonomic combinations (SI Appendix, Part C and Fig. S8).
   Multiple traits of the myxinoid crown in Tethymyxine are lacking in the
   Carboniferous stem myxinoid Myxinikela. In Myxinikela, the branchial
   apparatus sits well within the cranial domain, and the liver appears to
   be a single lobe. Given its state of preservation, α-keratin in the
   slime glands would have been preserved if present in Myxinikela. Thus,
   these crown myxinoid traits were likely acquired along the remaining
   200–250 My ghost lineage (Fig. 3A).

   Our analyses reveal cyclostomes as a clade using morphological data.
   Both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses converged on this result
   with the same clade membership (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). The
   dataset performed consistently with theoretical predictions (33).
   Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences generated trees that are
   largely congruent with each other. The maximum parsimony trees are
   better resolved (more precise) than the Bayesian trees. Importantly,
   cyclostome monophyly based on morphology corroborates the topology
   consistently supported by molecular data (17, 18). The
   fossil-calibrated mitogenomic molecular clock (SI Appendix, Fig. S9)
   also produced divergence estimates for cyclostome crown clades that are
   largely congruent with the previous molecular clock analysis of nuclear
   genes (34). For the cyclostome crown, our divergence estimates
   (536.31–428.44 Mya) agree well with the previous estimates (480–430
   Mya). Calibrated with Tethymyxine (100.5–93.9 Mya), the myxinoid crown
   is now pushed to an older interval (183.95–103.30 Mya) than in the
   previous analysis (90–40 Mya). The petromyzontiform crown is estimated
   shallower (194.84–163.14 Mya) than in the analysis of nuclear genes
   (280–220 Mya), but the split between the southern and northern
   hemispheric clades is constrained to before the separation and breakup
   of Gondwana in both analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (34).

   This morphological–molecular congruence is a significant update of the
   cyclostome hypothesis (Fig. 1 C and E). One principal advance is
   phylogenetic resolution of fossil jawless vertebrates under cyclostome
   monophyly. These fossil forms include (i) putative stem taxa of
   cyclostome lineages (e.g., Myxinikela), and (ii) lineages that have
   been placed on the gnathostome stem under cyclostome paraphyly (e.g.,
   anaspids and euconodonts). Molecular datasets contain no information
   from the fossils, but previous schemes of the cyclostome hypothesis
   assumed the taxa within cyclostomes and the taxa on the gnathostome
   stem without including them all in a single cladistic test (18). The
   stem cyclostome status of anaspids and euconodonts has never been
   supported quantitatively in previous analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6 and S8). Furthermore, our Bayesian analysis (i) did not
   resolve the polytomy of several other lineages with cyclostome and
   gnathostome total clades; and (ii) supported euconodonts as stem
   myxinoids (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These results are reminiscent of
   early classification schemes of cyclostomes (Fig. 1 A and B) and
   precladistic attempts to classify conodonts, but have the basis in
   different characters.

   Our morphological dataset has a long list of characters that support
   cyclostome monophyly and stem cyclostome status of anaspids and
   euconodonts (SI Appendix, Table S3). The crown has two unambiguous
   synapomorphies in keratinous tooth plates and periocular position of
   trunk myomeres (Fig. 3A). The characters posited previously as
   cyclostome synapomorphies (e.g., pulley-like feeding apparatus) (4) are
   either not preserved in fossils [thus optimized to the crown cyclostome
   node only under delayed transformation (DELTRAN)] or symplesiomorphic
   to cyclostomes. In comparison, keratin is decay-resistant relative to
   other soft tissues (25), and myomeric positions can be determined using
   a number of osteological correlates, such as postbranchial wall in
   osteostracans (10). As for euconodonts, their position in the
   cyclostome stem is supported by the lack of anterior extension of the
   midline fin and the presence of denticulate elements within the buccal
   cavity (SI Appendix, Table S3). Recent attempts to associate conodonts
   with cyclostomes (or myxinoids) were based on the inferred presence of
   a pulley-like feeding apparatus (35) or the alleged homology of
   conodont elements with the keratinous tooth plates in living
   cyclostomes (36, 37). Both of these characters were coded as ambiguous
   in euconodonts in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Nevertheless, the
   Bayesian inferences supported the stem-myxinoid position. For
   parsimony, the cyclostome crown collapsed after coding these ambiguous
   characters for conodonts as seen in living cyclostomes (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8C).

   The morphological support for cyclostome monophyly emerged after
   enhancement of contingency coding method. Nearly all cyclostome
   synapomorphies in our dataset were included in previous morphological
   datasets in various definitions and coding schemes, and would have been
   optimized as cyclostome synapomorphies if the topology were constrained
   (SI Appendix, Table S4). These datasets suggest a number of other
   characters as potentially synapomorphic to cyclostomes under the same
   topological constraint. In our dataset, most of those additional
   characters are symplesiomorphic to cyclostomes (denoted with “§,” SI
   Appendix, Table S4) optimized in opposite character polarity (**), or
   parsimony-uninformative and not included (‡)—all consequences of
   assigning nonapplicable scores within those characters (SI Appendix,
   Parts D and E). Recoding nonapplicable scores to discrete character
   states resurrected paraphyletic cyclostomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).

   Our phylogeny implies hagfish morphology as specialized, not primitive.
   In myxinoids, trait absence or underdeveloped condition has been
   difficult to interpret—whether the absence (e.g., electroreceptors or
   extrinsic eye musculature) represents an ancestral or secondary
   condition, or whether the underdeveloped traits (e.g., vertebrae) are
   rudimentary or vestigial. Hagfish nested within cyclostomes suggest
   that these are derived states. Indeed, a large number of reversal
   events are optimized between the total and crown myxinoid nodes under
   both accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) and DELTRAN (SI Appendix,
   Table S3). Regarding those listed traits, hagfish appear to have lost
   them secondarily, in line with the narrative of the cyclostome
   hypothesis (5, 38). These character changes are parallel with
   acquisitions of the traits unique to hagfish, such as slime glands (SI
   Appendix, Table S3). Even cyclostomes on the whole appear to be rather
   specialized than primitive. The last common ancestor of all living
   vertebrates has often been posited as a soft-bodied
   hagfish/lamprey-like form (1). However, the stem cyclostome status of
   anaspids and euconodonts in the new phylogeny implies that the
   potential to mineralize skeletal matrix predated the cyclostome crown.
   This scenario is consistent with observations that modern hagfish and
   lampreys deposit calcium phosphates to line their inner ears (39), or
   that lamprey cartilages spontaneously calcify in vitro (40).

Conclusions

   An assessment of nonindependence among morphological characters may
   lead to unexpected congruence when a phylogenetic dispute is locked in
   a stalemate between internally consistent morphological and molecular
   inferences. Our phylogenetic analysis of cyclostomes provides one such
   case study. In this phylogeny of cyclosotmes, the new fossil hagfish
   Tethymyxine represents an important calibration point not just for the
   divergence of the myxinoid crown, but also for many morphological
   traits (e.g., slime glands) that set hagfish apart from all other
   vertebrates. The morphologically supported Cyclostomi implies some of
   the characters conventionally considered primitive in hagfish (e.g.,
   the absence of extraocular muscles, electroreceptors, or taste buds) as
   specialized. This view is consistent with the developmental features of
   hagfish interpreted as vestigial and derived (e.g., axial skeleton)
   (38, 41). Between two living cyclostome lineages, lampreys may serve as
   a better outgroup to gnathostomes, but a full extent of their utility
   as an outgroup remains unknown until evolutionary origins of the
   peculiar life history (distinct larval phase with dramatic
   metamorphosis) are resolved (42, 43).

Methods

   SRS-XRF was performed at beam line 6–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron
   Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
   SRS-XRF is a noninvasive technique that can spatially resolve chemical
   element composition in large samples in short time frames (44). For the
   new phylogeny, three lines of analyses were performed: (i) maximum
   parsimony analyses; (ii) nonclock Bayesian analyses; and (iii) clock
   analyses. The morphological dataset was the same for all of the
   analyses and included 52 taxa (SI Appendix, Table S2) and 168
   characters (SI Appendix, Part E). For the parsimony analyses, heuristic
   search was used with no topological constraint. For the non-clock-based
   Bayesian analyses, each analysis was run for 5 million generations with
   2 runs of 4 chains, without topological constraint, and sampling every
   5,000 generations. Finally, we generated a dataset with 16S and COI
   sequences for extant taxa and with fossil calibrations. This dataset
   was subjected to a Bayesian analysis under the fossilized birth–death
   model, given topology obtained from the parsimony analysis. This
   analysis provided divergence estimates shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S9.
   For full description, see SI Appendix, Parts B–E. Original data for
   SRS-XRF and phylogenetic analyses are placed in a permanent depository
   (45).

Significance

   The Pólya–Jensen criterion for the Riemann hypothesis asserts that RH
   is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of certain Jensen polynomials for
   all degrees d≥1 and all shifts n. For each degree d≥1, we confirm this
   criterion for all sufficiently large shifts n. This represents a
   theoretical advance in the field. The method of proof is rooted in the
   newly discovered phenomenon that these polynomials are nicely
   approximated by Hermite polynomials. Furthermore, it is shown that this
   method applies to a large class of related problems.

Abstract

   In 1927, Pólya proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)
   at its point of symmetry. This hyperbolicity has been proved for
   degrees d≤3. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the central
   derivatives ζ(2n)(1/2) that is accurate to all orders, which allows us
   to prove the hyperbolicity of all but finitely many of the Jensen
   polynomials of each degree. Moreover, we establish hyperbolicity for
   all d≤8. These results follow from a general theorem which models such
   polynomials by Hermite polynomials. In the case of the Riemann zeta
   function, this proves the Gaussian unitary ensemble random matrix model
   prediction in derivative aspect. The general theorem also allows us to
   prove a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang on the partition function.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

   Expanding on notes of Jensen, Pólya (1) proved that the Riemann
   hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of the Jensen
   polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) at its point of
   symmetry. More precisely, he showed that the RH is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of all Jensen polynomials associated with the sequence of
   Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} defined
   by−1+4z2 Λ12+z=∑n=0∞γ(n)n!⋅z2n,[1]where Λ(s)=π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s)=Λ(1−s),
   where we say that a polynomial with real coefficients is hyperbolic if
   all of its zeros are real, and where the Jensen polynomial of degree d
   and shift n of an arbitrary sequence {α(0),α(1),α(2),…} of real numbers
   is the polynomialJαd,n(X)≔∑j=0ddjα(n+j)Xj.[2]Thus, the RH is equivalent
   to the hyperbolicity of the polynomials Jγd,n(X) for all nonnegative
   integers d and n (1⇓–3). Since this condition is preserved under
   differentiation, to prove RH, it would be enough to show hyperbolicity
   for the Jγd,0(X).* Due to the difficulty of proving RH, research has
   focused on establishing hyperbolicity for all shifts n for small d.
   Previous to this paper, hyperbolicity was known for d≤3 by work^† of
   Csordas et al. (5) and Dimitrov and Lucas (3).

   Asymptotics for the γ(n) were obtained from Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov
   (7). We improve on their results by obtaining an arbitrary precision
   asymptotic formula^‡(Theorem 9), a result that is of independent
   interest. We will use this strengthened result to prove the following
   theorem for all degrees d.

Theorem 1.

   If d≥1, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for all sufficiently large n.

   An effective proof of Theorem 1 for small d gives the following
   theorem.

Theorem 2.

   If 1≤d≤8, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for every n≥0.

   Theorem 1 follows from a general phenomenon that Jensen polynomials for
   a wide class of sequences α can be modeled by the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), which we define (in a somewhat nonstandard normalization) as the
   orthogonal polynomials for the measure μ(X)=e−X2/4 or more explicitly
   by the generating
   function∑d=0∞Hd(X) tdd! = e−t2+Xt = 1 +X t + (X2−2) t22! + (X3−6X) t33!
    + ⋯ .[3]More precisely, we will prove the following general theorem
   describing the limiting behavior of Jensen polynomials of sequences
   with appropriate growth.

Theorem 3.

   Let {α(n)}, {A(n)}, and {δ(n)} be three sequences of positive real
   numbers with δ(n) tending to zero and
   satisfyinglogα(n+j)α(n)=A(n)j−δ(n)2j2+oδ(n)d as n→∞,[4]for some integer
   d≥1 and all 0≤j≤d. Then, we
   havelimn→∞δ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n)) = Hd(X),[5]uniformly for
   X in any compact subset of R.

   Since the Hermite polynomials have distinct roots, and since this
   property of a polynomial with real coefficients is invariant under
   small deformation, we immediately deduce the following corollary.

Corollary 4.

   The Jensen polynomials Jαd,n(X) for a sequence α:N→R satisfying the
   conditions in Theorem 3 are hyperbolic for all but finitely many values
   n.

   Theorem 1 is a special case of this corollary. Namely, we shall use
   Theorem 9 to prove that the Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} satisfy the
   required growth conditions in Theorem 3 for every d≥2.

   Theorem 3 in the case of the Riemann zeta function is the derivative
   aspect Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) random matrix model prediction
   for the zeros of Jensen polynomials. To make this precise, recall that
   Dyson (8), Montgomery (9), and Odlyzko (10) conjecture that the
   nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are distributed like the
   eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices. These eigenvalues satisfy
   Wigner’s Semicircular Law, as do the roots of the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), when suitably normalized, as d→+∞ (see chapter 3 of ref. 11).
   The roots of Jγd,0(X), as d→+∞, approximate the zeros of Λ12+z (see
   ref. 1 or lemma 2.2 of ref. 12), and so GUE predicts that these roots
   also obey the Semicircular Law. Since the derivatives of Λ12+z are also
   predicted to satisfy GUE, it is natural to consider the limiting
   behavior of Jγd,n(X) as n→+∞. The work here proves that these
   derivative aspect limits are the Hermite polynomials Hd(X), which, as
   mentioned above, satisfy GUE in degree aspect.

   Returning to the general case of sequences with suitable growth
   conditions, Theorem 3 has applications in combinatorics where the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials determines the log-concavity of
   enumerative statistics. For example, see the classic theorem by
   Heilmann and Leib (13), along with works by Chudnovsky and Seymour
   (14), Haglund (15), Haglund et al. (16), Stanley (17), and Wagner (18),
   to name a few. Theorem 3 represents a criterion for establishing the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials in enumerative combinatorics. The theorem
   reduces the problem to determining whether suitable asymptotics hold.
   Here, we were motivated by a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang
   concerning the Jensen polynomials Jpd,n(X), where p(n) is the partition
   function. Nicolas (19) and Desalvo and Pak (20) proved that Jp2,n(X) is
   hyperbolic for n≥25, and, more recently, Chen et al. proved (21) that
   Jp3,n(X) is hyperbolic for n≥94, inspiring them to state as a
   conjecture the following result.

Theorem 5 (Chen–Jia–Wang Conjecture).

   For every integer d≥1, there exists an integer N(d) such that Jpd,n(X)
   is hyperbolic for n≥N(d).

   Table 1 gives the conjectured minimal value for N(d) for d=2j with
   1≤j≤5. More precisely, for each d≤32 it gives the smallest integer such
   that Jpd,n(X) is hyperbolic for N(d) ≤ n ≤ 50,000.

   Conjectured minimal values of N(d)

Remark 6:

   Larson and Wagner (22) have made the proof of Theorem 5 effective by a
   brute-force implementation of Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of
   ref. 3). They showed that the values in the table are correct for d=4
   and d=5 and that N(d)≤(3d)24d(50d)3d2 in general. The true values are
   presumably much smaller and are probably of only polynomial growth, the
   numbers N(d) in the table being approximately of size 10 d2⁡log⁡d.

   Theorem 5 suggests a natural generalization. As is well known, the
   numbers p(n) are the Fourier coefficients of a modular form,
   namely,1η(τ) = ∑n=0∞ p(n) qn−124 (I(τ)>0, q=e2πiτ),[6]where
   η(τ)=q1/24∏(1−qn) is the Dedekind eta-function. Theorem 5 is then an
   example of a more general theorem about the Jensen polynomials of the
   Fourier coefficients of an arbitrary weakly holomorphic modular form,
   which, for the purposes of this work, will mean a modular form
   (possibly of fractional weight and with multiplier system) with real
   Fourier coefficients on the full modular group SL2(Z) that is
   holomorphic apart from a pole of (possibly fractional) positive order
   at infinity. If f is such a form, we denote its Fourier expansion by^§
   f(τ) = ∑n∈−m+Z≥0af(n) qn (m∈Q>0, af(−m) ≠ 0).[7]Then, we will prove the
   following theorem, which includes Theorem 5.

Theorem 7.

   If f is a weakly holomorphic modular form as above, then for any fixed
   d≥1, the Jensen polynomials Jafd,n(X) are hyperbolic for all
   sufficiently large n.

   Our results are proved by showing that each of the sequences of
   interest to us [the partition function, the Fourier coefficients of
   weakly holomorphic modular forms, and the Taylor coefficients at s=12
   of 4s(1−s)Λ(s)] satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3, which we prove
   in Section 2. Actually, in Section 2, we prove a more general result
   (Theorem 8) that gives the limits of suitably normalized Jensen
   polynomials for an even bigger class of sequences having suitable
   asymptotic properties (but without necessarily the corollary about
   hyperbolicity). Theorem 7 giving the hyperbolicity for coefficients of
   modular forms (and hence also for the partition function) is proved in
   Section 3. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 9, which gives an asymptotic
   formula to all orders for the Taylor coefficients of Λ(s) at s=12, and
   in Section 5, we prove Theorems 1 and 2 for the Riemann zeta function
   by using these asymptotics to verify that the hypotheses of Theorem 3
   are fulfilled by the numbers γ(n). We conclude in Section 6 with some
   numerical examples.

2. Proof of Theorem 3

   We deduce Theorem 3 from the following more general result.

Theorem 8.

   Suppose that {E(n)} and {δ(n)} are positive real sequences with δ(n)
   tending to 0, and that F(t)=∑i=0∞citi is a formal power series with
   complex coefficients. For a fixed d≥1, suppose that there are real
   sequences {C0(n)},…,{Cd(n)}, with limn→+∞Ci(n)=ci for 0≤i≤d, such that
   for 0≤j≤d, we
   haveα(n+j)α(n) E(n)−j = ∑i=0d Ci(n) δ(n)iji + oδ(n)d as n→+∞.[8]Then,
   the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds with  exp(A(n))  replaced by E(n) and
   Hd(X) replaced by HF,d(X), where the polynomials HF,m(X)∈C[x] are now
   defined either by the generating function F(−t) eXt=∑HF,m(X) tm/m! or
   in closed form by HF,m(X) ≔ m! ∑k=0m(−1)m−kcm−k Xk/k! .

Proof of Theorems 8 and 3.

   After replacing exp(A(n)) by E(n), the polynomial appearing on the
   left-hand side of [5]
   becomesδ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1E(n) = ∑k=0ddk δ(n)k−d ∑j=kd (−1)j−k d
   −kj−k α(n+j)α(n)E(n)j Xk.Since 0≤j≤d, and since the error term in [8]
   is o(δ(n)d), we may reorder summation and find that the limiting value
   as n→+∞ of the quantity in square brackets
   satisfieslimn→+∞∑i=0dCi(n) δ(n)k−d+i ∑j=kd(−1)j−k d−kj−k ji = (−1)d−k(d
   −k)! cd−k,because the inner sum, which is the (d−k)th difference of the
   polynomial j↦ji evaluated at j=0, vanishes for i<d−k and equals (d−k)!
   for i=d−k. Theorem 8 follows, and Theorem 3 is just the special case
   E(n)=eA(n) and F(t)=e−t2. □

3. Proof of Theorem 7

   Assume that f is a modular form of (possibly fractional) weight k on
   SL2(Z) (possibly with multiplier system) and with a pole of (possibly
   fractional) order m>0 at infinity and write its Fourier expansion at
   infinity as in [7]. It is standard, either by the circle method of
   Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher or by using Poincaré series (for example,
   see ref. 23), that the Fourier coefficients of f have the asymptotic
   formaf(n)=Af nk−12 Ik−1(4πmn)+OnC e2πmn,[9]as n→∞ for some nonzero
   constants Af [an explicit multiple of af(−m)] and C, where Iκ(x)
   denotes the usual I-Bessel function. In view of the expansion of Bessel
   functions at infinity, this implies that af(n) has an asymptotic
   expansion to all orders in 1/n of the
   formaf(n) ∼ e4πmn n2k−34 expc0 + c1n + c2n2 + ⋯,for some constants
   c0, c1, …  depending on f [and in fact only on m and k if we normalize
   the leading coefficient af(−m) of f to be equal to 1]. This gives an
   asymptotic
   expansionlogaf(n+j)af(n) ∼ 4πm ∑i=1∞1/2ijini−12 + 2k−34∑i=1∞(−1)i−1jii 
   ni + ∑i,k≥1ck−kijini+k,[10]valid to all orders in n, and it follows
   that the sequence {af(n)} satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with
   A(n)=2πm/n+O(1/n) and δ(n)=(π/2)1/2m1/4n−3/4+O(n−5/4). Theorem 7 then
   follows from the corollary to Theorem 3.

4. Asymptotics for Λ(n)(12)

   Previous work of Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov (7) offer asymptotics^¶
   for the derivatives Λ(n)12. Here, we follow a slightly different
   approach and obtain effective asymptotics, a result which is of
   independent interest. To describe our asymptotic expansion, we first
   give a formula for these derivatives in terms of an auxiliary function,
   whose asymptotic expansion we shall then determine.

   Following Riemann (cf. chapter 8 of ref. 25), we
   haveΛ(s)=∫0∞ts2−1 θ0(t) dt=1s(s−1)+∫1∞ts2+t1−s2 θ0(t) dtt,where
   θ0(t)=∑k=1∞e−πk2t=12(t−1/2−1)+t−1/2θ0(1/t). It follows
   thatΛ(n)12=− 2n+2 n!+F(n)2n−1,[11]for n>0 (both are of course zero for
   n odd), where F(n) is defined for any real n≥0
   byF(n)=∫1∞(log⁡t)n t−3/4 θ0(t) dt.[12]In particular, if n is a positive
   integer, then the Taylor coefficients γ(n) defined in [1]
   satisfyγ(n)=n!(2n)!⋅82n2Λ(2n−2)12−Λ(2n)12=n!(2n)!⋅ 322n2F(2n−2)−F(2n)22
   n−1.[13]

Theorem 9.

   If n>0, then the function F(n) defined by [12] is given to all orders
   in n by the asymptotic
   expansionF(n) ∼ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n+b2n2+⋯ (n→∞),wher
   e L=L(n)≈lognlog⁡n is the unique positive solution of the equation
   n=L(πeL+34) and each coefficient bk belongs to Q(L), the first value
   being b1=2L4+9L3+16L2+6L+224 (L+1)3.

Example 10:

   Here, we illustrate Theorem 9. The two-term
   approximationF(n) ≈ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n=:F^(n),is
   sufficiently strong for the proof of Theorem 1. In particular, Theorem
   9 and [13] implyγ^(n)≔n!(2n)!26−2n2n2F^(2n−2)=γ(n)1+O1n2−ε.[14]Here are
   some approximations γ^(n) obtained from this expression by numerically
   computing L using its defining equation above. Table 2 illustrates the
   high precision of this formula.

   Table 2.

   Comparison of γ(n) and γ^(n)

Proof of Theorem 9:

   We approximate the integrand in [12] by f(t)=(log⁡t)nt−3/4e−πt (from
   now on, we consider n as fixed and omit it from the notations). We have
   tddtlog⁡f(t)=nlog⁡t−πt−34, so f(t) assumes its unique maximum at t=a,
   where a=eL is the solution in (1,∞) ofn=πa+34log⁡a.We can then apply
   the usual saddle point method. The Taylor expansion of f(t) around t=a
   is given
   byf(1+λ)af(a)=1+log(1+λ)log⁡an(1+λ)−3/4e−πλa=e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯,where
   C=(ε+ε2)n−34 (here we have set ε=1log⁡a=L−1) and the Ai (i≥3) are
   polynomials of degree ⌊i/3⌋ in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. This
   expansion is found by expanding log(f((1+λ)a))−log(f(a)) in λ. The
   linear term vanishes by the choice of a, the quadratic term is −Cλ2/2,
   and the coefficients of the higher powers of λ are all linear
   expressions in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. Exponentiating this
   expansion gives the claimed expression for f((1+λ)a)/f(a), where the
   dominant term of each Ai is governed primarily by the exponential of
   the cubic term of the logarithmic expansion. The first few Ai
   areA3=ε3+ε22+ε33 n−14, A4=−ε4+11ε224+ε32+ε44 n+316,A5=ε5+5ε212+7ε312+ε4
   2+ε55 n − 320,A6=ε218+ε36+17ε472+ε56+ε618 n2 − ε4+91ε2180+17ε324+17ε424
   +ε52+ε66 n+532.Plugging in t=(1+λ)a immediately gives the asymptotic
   expansion∫1∞f(t) dt=a f(a) ∫−1+1/a∞e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯ dλ=a f(a) 2πC 1
   +3A4C2+15A6C3+⋯+(2i−1)!!A2iCi+⋯.(Here, only the part of the integral
   with Cλ2<B⁡log⁡n, where B is any function of n going to infinity as n
   does, contributes.) This equality and the expression in Theorem 9 are
   interpreted as asymptotic expansions. Although these series themselves
   may not converge for a fixed n, we may truncate the resulting
   approximation at O(n−A) for some A>0, and as n→+∞, this approximation
   becomes true to the specified precision. Substituting into this
   expansion the formulas for C and Ai in terms of n, we obtain the
   statement of the theorem with F(n) replaced by the integral over f(t),
   with only A2i (i≤3k) contributing to bk. But then the same asymptotic
   formula holds also for F(n), since the ratio f(t)/θ0(t)=1+e−3πt+⋯  is
   equal to 1+O(n−K) for any K>0 for t near a. □

5. Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

A. Proof of Theorem 1

   For each d≥1, we use Theorem 3 with sequences {A(n)} and {δ(n)} for
   whichlogγ(n+j)γ(n)=A(n)j−j2δ(n)2+∑i=3dgi(n)ji+oδ(n)d,[15]for all 0≤j≤d,
   where gi(n)=oδ(n)i. Stirling’s formula, [13], and [14]
   giveγ(n)=en−2nn+12(1+112n)Ln^2n^−3n^n^+12(1+112n^)2πK⋅expL4−n^L+341+b1(
   n^)n^1+O1n2−ε,[16]where n^≔2n−2, L≔L(n^), and
   K≔K(n^)≔L(n^)−1+L(n^)−2n^−3/4. The L(n^) are values of a nonvanishing
   holomorphic function for R(n)>1, and so for |j|<n−1, we have the Taylor
   expansionL(j;n)≔L(n^+2j)L(n^)=1+∑m≥1ℓm(n)jmm!.If J=λ(n−1) with −1<λ<1,
   then the asymptotic L(n)≈log(nlog⁡n)
   implieslimn→+∞L(J,n)=limn→+∞Ln^(λ+1)L(n^)=1.In particular, we have
   ℓ1(n)=2K⋅L2 and ℓ2(n)=−8(n^−3/4L)(1+L/2)K3⋅L5 and ℓm(n)=o1(n−1)m. By a
   similar argument applied
   toK(j;n)≔K(n^+2j)K(n^)=1+∑m≥1km(n)jmm! and B(j;n)≔1+b1(n^+2j)n^+2j1+b1(
   n^)n^=1+∑m≥1βm(n)jmm!,we find that βm(n)=o1(n−1)m+1,
   k1(n)=2(L+1)K⋅L2−2n^(L+2)K2L4, and km(n)=o1(n−1)m for m≥2.

   Let R(j;n) be the approximation for γ(n+j)/γ(n) obtained from [16]. We
   then expand log⁡R(j;n)=:∑m≥1gm(n)jm, with the idea that we will choose
   A(n)∼g1(n) and δ(n)∼−g2(n). To this end, if J=λ(n−1) for −1<λ<1, then a
   calculation reveals
   that−(1+λ)log(1+λ)=limn→+∞log⁡R(J;n)−J⁡lognL24n^2−Jn−1.[17]Therefore,
   gm(n)=O(n−1)1−m, and algebraic manipulations
   giveg1(n)=lognL24n^2+n^ℓ1(n)L+1L−2L+ℓ1(n)⋅L4−k1(n)2+O1n2−ε,g2(n)=−1n^+4
   ℓ1(n)+n^ℓ2(n)L+12L−n^ℓ1(n)2L+22L+O1n2−ε.Using the formulas for
   ℓ1(n), ℓ2(n), and k1(n) above, we
   defineδ(n)≔1n^−2L2⋅K and A(n)≔lognL24n^2+L−1L2⋅K+n^(L+2)L4⋅K2.[18]The
   bounds for the gm(n) and the asymptotics above imply the o(1) error
   term in [15], and also that for sufficiently large n we have 0<δ(n)→0.
   Therefore, Theorem 3 applies, and its corollary gives Theorem 1.

B. Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 2

   Let A(n) and δ(n) be as in [18]. If we
   letJ^γd,n(X)≔δ(n)−dγ(n)⋅Jγd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n))=∑k=0dβkd,nXk,then
   Theorem 1 implies that limn→+∞J^γd,n(X)=Hd(X) =: ∑k=0dhkXk. We have
   confirmed the hyperbolicity of the J^γd,n(X) for n≤106 and 4≤d≤8 using
   Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of ref. 3).

   Using this criterion, we also chose vectors εd≔(εd(d),εd(d−1),…,εd(0))
   of positive numbers and signs sd,sd−1,…,s0∈{±1} for which J^γd,n(X) is
   hyperbolic if 0≤sk(βkd,n−hk)<εd(k) for all k. To make use of these
   inequalities, for positive integers n and 1≤j≤8, define real numbers
   C(n,j) byγ(n+j)γ(n)eA(n)j⋅eδ(n)2j2=1+C(n,j)n3/2.[19]Using an effective
   form of [16], it can be shown^∥ that 0<C(n,j)<14.25 for all n≥7 and
   1≤j≤8. Finally, we determined numbers Mεd for which the required
   inequalities hold for n≥Mεd. The proof follows from the fact that we
   found suitable choices for which Mεd<106.

Example 11:

   We illustrate the case of d=4 using ε4≔(0.041,1.384,0.813,7.313,0.804).
   For n≥100 the odd degree coefficients
   satisfy0<β34,n<28 δ(n) and −145.70δ(n)<β14,n<0,while the even degree
   coefficients
   satisfy1−16.05 δ(n)2<β44,n<1, −12<β24,n<−12+16.20 δ(n), 12−16.01 δ(n)<β
   04,n<12.It turns out that Mε4≔104<106.

6. Examples

   For convenience, we let the J^αd,n(X) denote the polynomials which
   converge to Hd(X) in [5]. We now illustrate Theorem 7 with [6], where
   m=1/24 and k=−1/2. Using [10], we may choose A(n)=2π24n−1−2424n−1 and
   δ(n)=12π(24n−1)3/2−288(24n−1)2. Although the one-term approximations of
   [10] given at the end of Section 3 also satisfy Theorem 3, the two-term
   approximations converge more quickly and better illustrate the result.
   With these data, we observe in Table 3 indeed that the degree 2 and 3
   partition Jensen polynomials are modeled by H2(X)=X2−2 and H3(X)=X3−6X.

Significance

   Whether the dry-season length will increase is a central question in
   determining the fate of the rainforests over Amazonia and the future
   global atmospheric CO[2] concentration. We show observationally that
   the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased
   significantly since 1979. We do not know what has caused this change,
   although it resembles the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The
   global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report seem to substantially
   underestimate the variability of the dry-season length. Such a bias
   implies that the future change of the dry-season length, and hence the
   risk of rainforest die-back, may be underestimated by the projections
   of these models.

Abstract

   We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over
   southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending
   dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire
   season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and
   an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter
   (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring
   (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the
   variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they
   show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported
   in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of
   inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate
   models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly
   underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling
   processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL
   may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report
   models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the
   DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate
   of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the
   2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The
   large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused
   effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern
   Amazonia.

     * rainforests
     * climate model projection

   Fifteen percent of global photosynthesis occurs in the Amazon
   rainforest (1), where 25% of plant species are found (2). This
   rainforest ecosystem normally removes C from the atmosphere but
   released more than 1 Pg of C to the atmosphere in the 2005 drought (3).
   Consequently, even a partial loss of these forests would substantially
   increase global atmospheric CO[2] (4, 5) and reduce biodiversity. The
   dry-season length (DSL) is among the most important climate limitations
   for sustaining rainforests (6⇓⇓–9), especially in southern Amazonia,
   where rainforests are exposed to relatively long dry seasons and
   vulnerable to increasing conversion of native forests to cultivated
   crops (10⇓–12). The extreme droughts in 2005 and 2010 had strong
   impacts on the rainforest and its C cycle (3, 13, 14). These unusual
   events, along with possible increase of drought severity and DSL during
   the past few decades (e.g., refs. 15 and 16) heighten the urgency of
   understanding what causes these dry anomalies and whether they will
   continue into the future. Contrary to the observed drying, some global
   climate models that previously projected strong drying over Amazonia
   now project much weaker drying by the end of the 21st century as these
   models evolve (17). Do these observed events represent the extremes of
   natural climate variability, or do climate projections underestimate
   potential future changes? This study explores one aspect of these
   questions by focusing on the change of DSL.

Evidence from Observations

   Rain-gauge data from Amazonia are sparse and generally inadequate for
   assessing a trend in rainfall amounts. However, the dry-season end
   (DSE) over southern Amazonia is marked by a relatively rapid increase
   of rainfall on the order of 4–5 mm/d over areas of thousands of square
   kilometers during austral spring, and vice versa for the dry-season
   arrival (DSA) during austral fall (March–May) (18, 19). Hence, the
   timing of the DSA and DSE should be more clearly detectable by the
   rain-gauge network than the change in rainfall amount.

   The DSL and DSE are derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center’s improved 1° gridded
   historical daily precipitation analysis over the Brazilian and Bolivian
   Amazon for the period of January 1978 to December 2007 (referred to as
   the Silva data; ref. 20) and the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center’s 1°
   gridded daily precipitation data over the Brazilian and other northern
   Amazonian countries for the period of January 1940 to December 2011
   (referred to as the recently updated SA24 data; ref. 21). These two
   regional daily rainfall datasets are based on ∼300–450 rain gauges that
   have been present throughout Amazonia (20, 21) for most of the time
   since 1979, more than those included in the global daily rainfall data
   (22). Both datasets show patterns of temporal variability, including
   their trends, similar to that obtained from the Global Precipitation
   Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly rainfall data and the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite for the periods they
   overlap, although these regional rain gauge-based datasets show lower
   rainfall amounts compared with the satellite-based GPCP and TRMM (Fig.
   S1). The Silva dataset (20) has fewer rain gauges over the northeastern
   part of our southern Amazonian domain (5°–15°S, 50°–70°W), whereas the
   SA24 dataset (21) does not include rain gauges over the Bolivian
   Amazon, in the southwestern part of this domain. To mitigate such
   differences in the areas covered by rain gauges, we average these two
   rainfall datasets over each map cell for the period of 1979–2007 when
   they overlap and use SA24 for the period of 2008–2011 to form a merged
   daily rainfall dataset, referred to as the P[M] data. For the period of
   January 1979–December 2011, daily rain rates of the P[M] data are first
   spatially averaged over the southern Amazonian domain and then
   temporally averaged over a 5-d period (pentad) to reduce synoptic noise
   in estimating the DSA and DSE dates. The observed DSE is determined by
   the first date when the pentad mean rain rate changes from below to
   above the climatological annual mean rain rate of the same rainfall
   dataset during six out of eight pentads, and vice versa for the DSA
   (19). This definition captures the rapid transition from a lower to
   higher rainfall regime associated with the DSE, and vice versa for the
   DSA. The DSE and DSA are not influenced by any bias of rainfall amount,
   as long as the temporal patterns of the rainfall variation are not
   affected. Similar definitions have been widely used in the literature
   (18, 19, 23). For analysis of models, we modify our criterion to five
   out of eight pentads to best match the modeled DSE and DSA with
   observations.

   The trends are computed using a least square fit. The confidence
   intervals and significance are determined based on the effective sample
   size and a t test, following Santer et al. (24). The trend significance
   is further tested by the right-tailed (positive) Vogelsang trend test,
   a more conservative test for strongly auto-correlated and nonstationary
   time series (25).

   Fig. 1 shows the temporal variations of the DSL, DSE, and the mean
   rainfall during the dry-to-wet transition in austral spring season
   derived from the P[M] dataset. The strong delay of the DSE in 2004 and
   2005 is consistent with previous reports on the 2005 Amazonian drought
   (26, 27). The 2010 drought was mainly caused by strong rainfall
   reduction in early and middle 2010, followed by a rapid increase of
   rainfall at the end of October (16) (Fig. S2). Hence, the DSE in 2010
   was not delayed. As shown in Table 1, the DSL has increased at a rate
   of 1.3 ± 0.5 pentad or about 6.5 ± 2.5 d per decade for uncertainties
   of P < 5% (24). This increase is mainly caused by a delay of the DSE at
   a rate of 0.9 ± 0.4 pentads or 4.5 ± 2.0 d per decade (P < 5%), as also
   evident in a decrease of rainfall by 0.19 ± 0.04 mm/d per decade (P <
   5%) during austral spring. The more stringent Vogelsang test (25) still
   shows that these trends are significantly positive, but with
   uncertainty P < 10%. This delay of the DSE in recent decades is
   consistent with that inferred from a monthly rainfall dataset (16), the
   significant trends of decreasing rainfall at two long-term rain gauge
   stations located within our southern Amazonia domain (28), and also a
   decrease of convective cloudiness during austral spring detected by
   satellites (29). No significant changes of the DSA and rain rate are
   detected (Fig. S3).

   (A) Annual time series of the DSL (red line) and DSE (blue line) dates
   derived from the P[M] daily rainfall data over the southern Amazonian
   domain show a decrease of DSL due to a delay of DSE. The unit is pentad
   (5 d). On the left axis, the 55th pentad corresponds to September 2–7
   of the calendar date and the 70th pentad corresponds to December 10–15.
   (B) Time series of austral spring seasonal rainfall over southern
   Amazonia derived from the P[M] and GPCP datasets show decrease of
   rainfall consistent with the delay of DSE shown in (A). The linear
   trend is determined by a least-square fitting. Trends are significant
   at P < 5% based on Santer et al. (24).

   The linear trends, confident interval and significance of the DSL and
   DSE for the periods 1979–2011 and 1979–2005

   The main fire season over southern Amazonia spans the period of
   August–October, during the transition from the dry to the wet season. A
   delayed DSE would prolong the fire season, leading to an increase of
   fire counts during October and November. Thus, the latter measured by
   satellite can provide an independent verification of the former. Fig. 2
   shows that a delay of the DSE is correlated with fire counts in the
   prolonged fire season (the correlation coefficient for the de-trended
   data is R = 0.83, P < 0.01, based on the method of ref. 30). Similarly,
   the correlation coefficient for the de-trended DSL and fire counts is
   0.88, P < 0.01. This relationship is further supported by an increase
   of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI, ref. 31), as determined
   from two independent atmospheric reanalysis products, the European
   Center for Medium Range Forecast Reanalysis (ERA)-Interim (32) and the
   National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses (33). A
   high FFDI value represents a favorable meteorological condition for
   fire. These consistent changes between three physically related but
   independently obtained variables lend additional support to the
   observed delay of the DSE.

   The DSE (unit is pentad) versus FFDI (green squares, units are
   nondimensional) and fire count (red circles, unit is number of pixels)
   in October and November for the period of 2000–2011 suggest prolonged
   fire season with delayed DSE. The 50th pentad corresponds to September
   10–15 and the 70th pentad corresponds to December 10–15. The fire
   counts are derived from the moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer fire-count data. FFDI is first derived from the
   ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis, respectively, and then averaged to
   obtain its values shown in the figure.

   What could cause this delay of the DSE over southern Amazonia? Previous
   studies have established that stronger convective inhibition energy
   (CIN) and/or a poleward displacement of the subtropical jet over South
   America (SJ[SA]) in austral winter are important contributors to an
   anomalously late DSE in austral spring (19, 34, 35). The former
   increases the work required to lift air near the surface to the level
   of free convection, above which the rising air becomes buoyant. The
   latter blocks cold-front incursions from the extratropics that would
   trigger rainfall over a large area and result in DSE (35). The
   influence of these preconditions on the DSE can be altered by random
   variations of the atmospheric circulation and oceanic circulations in
   austral spring. Such influences should be reduced by averaging over
   time, leading to more clear relationships between the SJ[SA], CIN, and
   DSE on a decadal scale than on an interannual scale. Fig. 3 shows that
   the delay of the DSE tends to occur when the SJ[SA] is displaced
   poleward and CIN is relatively large. Likewise, an earlier DSE tends to
   occur when the SJ[SA] is displaced equatorward and CIN is relatively
   low. Strong CIN combined with equatorward displacement of SJ[SA] or low
   CIN with poleward SJ[SA] do not seem to cause delay of the DSE,
   presumably because they compensate each other’s effects on the DSE. On
   a decadal scale, CIN increased in the 1990s relative to the 1980s (P <
   5%, ref. 36). In the 2000s, CIN increased further from its values in
   the 1980s and 1990s, and SJ[SA] becomes significantly more poleward. On
   an interannual scale, these connections between the SJ[SA], CIN, and
   DSE variations are less obvious, presumably owing to the influence on
   the DSE of random interannual variations of the tropical sea surface
   temperatures (SSTAs) and the Southern Annular Mode of the atmosphere in
   austral spring.

   Fig. 3.

   DSE date as a function of the latitudinal location of the SJ[SA] and
   CIN in austral winter over southern Amazonia for the period of
   1979–2011 suggests a preference of poleward SJ[SA] and strong CIN by
   the delayed DSE. CIN and SJ[SA] are first calculated using the inputs
   from ERA-Interim (ERAI) and NCEP reanalysis, respectively, then
   averaged to obtain the values shown in this figure. The triangle,
   square, and diamond symbols denote decadal means for the 1980s, 1990s,
   and 2000s. The error bars on these symbols represent the SEs with
   uncertainties of P < 5% (36).

   What has caused the increase of CIN and poleward displacement of the
   SJ[SA]? Most previous studies have linked change of rainfall over
   southern Amazonia to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), changes of
   meridional SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic ocean associated with
   the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO, 26, 27, 37) and that of
   SJ[SA] to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (35, 37). Because the
   periods of available rainfall data are too short to obtain significant
   correlations of these variables on a decadal scale, we evaluate the
   relationship between CIN, SJ[SA], and the SSTAs indices using their
   unfiltered de-trended time series for austral winter. Because the
   results are dominated by the interannual variations, the correlation
   coefficients between AMO and CIN may be weakened by strong interference
   from ENSO compared with those that might be obtained on a decadal scale
   from a longer record. The result indicates that CIN is marginally
   correlated with the PDO index (P = 8%, 30), whereas SJ[SA] is not
   correlated with any of the ENSO, PDO, or AMO indices (Table S1). The
   lack of any robust correlation is consistent with the facts that (i)
   the SSTAs associated with ENSO, PDO, and AMO are generally weaker in
   austral winter and so are their influences on atmospheric circulation
   compared with austral summer or fall (38⇓–40) and (ii) CIN is
   influenced by soil moisture anomalies, vegetation root depth, and lower
   troposphere temperature. Hence, any relationship with SSTAs is likely
   to be complex and nonlinear.

   Could the decadal phase change of PDO and AMO qualitatively explain the
   change of CIN and SJ[SA]? The PDO has been decreasing since the 1990s
   and became overall negative during 2000s. Such a change would not
   explain a poleward shift of SJ[SA] (38) and an increase of CIN over
   southern Amazonia. AMO has shown a positive trend since 1979. However,
   the correlation between AMO and CIN is insignificant. Thus, natural
   interannual and decadal oceanic variability cannot be used to explain
   the changes of CIN and SJ[SA] during the last few decades.

   Could greenhouse effect-forced changes explain the increase of CIN and
   poleward shift of SJ[SA]? Previous studies have established that the
   observed decreasing atmospheric temperature lapse rate and increasing
   surface temperature over the tropics during the past several decades
   are consistent with the “fingerprint” of the greenhouse effect (41).
   Over Amazonia, surface relative humidity has been decreasing owing to
   an increase of surface temperature over the past few decades (42).
   These changes could increase CIN, especially during winter (the dry
   season), when the surface air humidity cannot increase proportionally
   with temperature.

   The poleward shift of SJ[SA] can be contributed by both a globally
   poleward shift of the southern hemisphere subtropical jets (SJ[SH]) and
   by the atmospheric planetary wave response to warm SSTAs over the
   central Pacific that is distinctively different from those induced by
   the ENSO and PDO (39, 43). In austral winter, the former is attributed
   to having been forced by the increase of greenhouse gases (43, 44),
   whereas the trend of the latter is attributed to having been forced by
   the warming of the central Pacific and Indian oceans in turn forced by
   greenhouse gases (39). The depletion of Antarctic ozone contributes
   importantly to the poleward shift of SJ[SH] in austral summer and fall,
   but not in the winter season. It peaks in the middle stratosphere
   during austral spring (45) and its influence on atmospheric circulation
   propagates downward to the upper troposphere to influence the SJ[SH]
   during austral summer. However, after the ozone hole recovers in
   austral fall, its effect becomes negligible for the austral winter
   (45). Hence, the observed changes of CIN and SJ[SA] seem to be broadly
   consistent with those expected from forcing by greenhouse warming, and
   not a consequence of the ozone hole.

   Land use can reduce land surface latent fluxes, and biomass burning
   aerosols can stabilize the atmospheric temperature stratification and
   weaken the dry-to-wet-season transition (46⇓⇓–49). Both could
   contribute to the delay of the DSE. However, long-term rain gauges and
   satellite observations show more clear decrease of rainfall and high
   clouds over the southwestern and northeastern parts of southern
   Amazonia where land use and fire are less prevalent than they are over
   the “Fire Arch” in southeastern Amazonia (28, 29). Furthermore, the DSE
   did not change before or after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption (Fig.
   1). Thus, what influence biomass burning aerosols and land use have on
   the observed delay of the DSE remains unclear beyond the observation
   that they do not seem to be the dominant cause.

Comparison with Climate Models

   Attributing the changes of DSE, CIN, and SJ[SA] to anthropogenic
   climate change and projecting their future changes require creditable
   climate models. Hence, we evaluate the 50 simulations provided by eight
   global climate models presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) based on the
   availability of their daily outputs of rainfall and other needed
   climate variables. These models are identified along with relevant
   information in Datasets and Methods and Table S2. The changes from the
   historical simulations of the global climate models that were presented
   in the IPCC AR5 are expected to be a result of random natural climate
   variability and appropriate anthropogenic and external forcing. If
   these models were perfect and the numbers of simulations were
   sufficient to generate a full spectrum of climate variability, one or
   more of these simulations would have captured the observed changes.
   Thus, the discrepancies between the models and observations should be
   caused either by undersampling of the possible changes owing to
   insufficient numbers of simulations or model errors, or both. Because
   the IPCC AR5 historical simulations end in 2005, we compare the
   observed changes for the period of 1979–2005 to the modeled 27-y
   changes in Fig. 4.

   Fig. 4.

   Distributions of the nonoverlapped 27-y trends of the DSE generated by
   the natural variability simulations (blue), historical simulations
   (red), and projections of future changes under the RCP8.5 scenario
   (green), respectively, suggest that the modeled DSE changes, including
   the projected future change, are significantly weaker than that which
   are observed during 1979–2005. The top 5% of the modeled trend samples
   are marked by blue, red, and green vertical dashed lines for the
   natural variability, historical simulations, and RCP8.5 scenario,
   respectively. The observed 27-y trend and confidence interval with
   uncertainties of P < 5% are marked by the black circle and horizontal
   bar in the upper right corner and are derived from the P[M] daily
   rainfall data following method of Santer et al. (24).

   The trend distribution of the simulations of natural variability is
   generated by 158 samples that represent nonoverlapped 27-y changes from
   a total of 4,266 y of simulation by multiple climate models. These
   simulations represent climate variability of the DSE changes for up to
   a few thousand years return period, and thus should adequately
   represent the range of the DSE natural variability for the time scale
   relevant to this study. The historical simulations by the eight climate
   models provide 40 samples of nonoverlapped 27-y changes for the period
   from the mid-19th century to 2005 and the climate projections under the
   Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario (RCP8.5) (50) provide
   38 samples of the nonoverlapped 27-y changes for the period from 2006
   up to 2299. Their ranges of the probability distributions are
   comparable to those represented by 158 samples of the natural
   variability simulations, despite their smaller number of samples. Thus,
   the differences between the statistical distribution of modeled changes
   and those observed should be mainly due to the models’ uncertainty,
   instead of due to under sampling of the climate variability.

   Fig. 4 shows that all of the changes of the DSE during 27-y periods
   modeled by the natural climate variability, the historical simulations,
   and the RCP8.5 future scenario are significantly smaller than those
   observed, although the occurrences of delayed DSE trends increase with
   anthropogenic climate change. For example, the historical simulations,
   with realistic anthropogenic forcing, show an increased frequency of
   delayed trends of the DSE compared with those of the natural
   variability scenario, and more so for the RCP8.5 future scenario.
   However, these simulations do not produce any trends that are
   comparable to the large observed trend. The RCP8.5 scenario assumes
   that by 2100 the global anthropogenic radiative forcing would reach 8.5
   Wm^−2 and that the atmospheric CO[2] concentration would become ∼1,360
   ppm. However, the projected DSE changes are still significantly smaller
   than the observed DSE delay during the past 27-y period (with the
   uncertainty of P < 5%, Fig. 4). Because the change of the DSE dominates
   that of the DSL, the simulated and projected DSL changes are also
   significantly smaller than those observed (Fig. S4).

   Why is there such a large discrepancy between modeled and observed
   changes of the DSE? Either the observed change of DSE during 1979–2005
   represents an extremely large swing from natural variability with a
   return period greater than 4,000 y or the climate models underestimate
   the natural and forced climatic variability of the DSE. To explore the
   possibility of the latter, we show in Fig. 5 that no model could
   reproduce the observed relationship between the changes of DSE, SJ[SA],
   and CIN in any of their historical simulations. The majority of the
   simulations show much weaker changes of SJ[SA] and CIN. These biases
   are consistent with the underestimation of SJ[SH] variability reported
   in the literature (44) and the overestimation of the influences of the
   Pacific and Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zones on Amazonia
   dry-season rainfall (51). The latter would undermine land-surface
   feedback and reduce the sensitivity of the CIN to land-surface warming
   and drying. Thus, the comparisons between historical simulations and
   observations suggest that the climate models evaluated in this study
   probably underestimate the sensitivity of the DSE, SJ[SA], and CIN to
   climate variability and anthropogenic change and that they could in
   turn underestimate potential future changes of the DSE and DSL over
   southern Amazonia (Fig. 4 and Figs. S4 and S5).

   eight IPCC AR5 models (circles) is different from that which is
   observed (red square). The character in the center of each circle
   indicates the model’s name shown in Table S2. The ensemble mean of the

Implications

   This study suggests that the IPCC AR5 models may underestimate the
   variability of the DSE (Fig. 4) and DSL (Fig. S4) over southern
   Amazonia and their sensitivity to the natural variability and
   anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. These biases could lead to
   an underestimate of the potential future climatic drying over southern
   Amazonia. However, one cannot simply extrapolate the observed changes
   to the future. Hence, we do not know how the DSL and DSE will change in
   the future without knowing what has caused their past changes. However,
   a risk of a future larger increase of DSL and delay of DSE does seem to
   be nonzero, as implied by its connection to the apparent influence of
   greenhouse-forced climate change on the CIN and SJ[SA]. Although its
   risk is highly uncertain, such a future increase of the DSL would have
   strong impacts on southern Amazonia were it to occur. For example, if
   we assume that the DSL were to increase at half of the rates we
   observed during 1979–2011, the DSL would be about 1 ± 1/3 mo longer by
   2090 than that in the 2000s. Consequently, the long DSL and fire season
   during the 2004–2005 drought would become the new norm (Fig. 2). Given
   the observed slow recovery of the rainforests after the 2005 drought
   (14), these changes could greatly increase the danger of a transition
   from a rainforest to a savanna regime over southern Amazonia (10, 12,
   52), especially with the longer DSL coupled to the higher surface
   temperatures and more fragmented forests expected in the future (11,
   12, 53), and even accounting for the increase of dry season resilience
   of the rainforest in an elevated CO[2] environment (17). Given such
   potential impacts on the global and regional C cycle and biodiversity,
   the large uncertainty in determining future changes of the DSL and DSE
   shown by this study highlights the importance and urgency of better
   monitoring and understanding the changes of the dry season over
   southern Amazonia. In addition to the impact of global climate forcing,
   the roles that regional biomass burning and land use play in the DSL
   over southern Amazonia also need to be clarified.

Datasets and Methods

   The CIN, SJ[SA], and FFDI are all derived from the ERA-Interim and the
   NCEP reanalyses. CIN in Fig. 3 is computed from 6-h temperature,
   humidity, and geopotential height profiles. In Fig. 5, a CIN index (54)
   is used because the models do not provide the instantaneous temperature
   and humidity profiles needed for computing CIN. The latitude of the
   SJ[SA] is determined by the equatorward latitudinal location of the 28
   m⋅s^−1 monthly zonal wind contour at 200 hPa between 30°and 90°W. This
   index most consistently captures the latitudinal variation of the
   SJ[SA]associated with tropical meridional circulation changes in the
   two reanalysis products, although the use of other similar zonal wind
   indices does not change the variations of the SJ[SA]. The variation of
   SJ[SA] based on this index is consistent with those determined by the
   zero stream function in latitudinal-height space and the 250 W⋅m^−2
   Outgoing Longwave Radiation Contour (55) used in the literature to
   describe changes of global subtropical jets. The FFDI (31) is computed
   as Embedded Image Embedded Image Embedded Image Embedded Image where T
   is the daily maximum temperature (°C), H is the daily minimum relative
   humidity (%), W is the daily mean wind speed at 10 m (km/h), N is the
   number of days since the last rain, R is the total rainfall (mm) in the
   most recent 24 h with rain, and I is the total rainfall (mm) needed to
   restore the soil moisture content to 200 mm. These inputs are provided
   by the 6-h outputs from the ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis. Fire count
   is obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on
   board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aqua
   satellite (56) (ftp://fire:burnt@fuoco.geog.umd.edu/).

   The AMO index is obtained from
   www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/AMO/. The PDO index is obtained
   from http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest. The Niño3 and Niño4
   indices are obtained from
   www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/climateindices/list/.

   Eight of the climate models that were part of the IPCC AR5 are used in
   this study based on availability of the daily outputs of precipitation
   and other needed climate variables. These models are the National
   Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version
   4 (CCSM4), the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model
   Version 3 (GFDL-CM3), the Earth System Model (GFDL-ESM2M), the NASA
   Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)-E2-H and GISS-E2-R models,
   the United Kingdom Met Office Hadley Center (HadGEM2-CC and HadGEM2-ES)
   models, and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-ESM-LR)
   model. All of the model output and observational datasets are remapped
   to the 2.5° latitude and longitude grids when they are compared with
   each other in Figs. 4 and 5. A brief summary of model resolutions,
   available ensemble simulations and sources of the models are provided
   in Table S2.

Significance

   The strong focus on species extinctions, a critical aspect of the
   contemporary pulse of biological extinction, leads to a common
   misimpression that Earth’s biota is not immediately threatened, just
   slowly entering an episode of major biodiversity loss. This view
   overlooks the current trends of population declines and extinctions.
   Using a sample of 27,600 terrestrial vertebrate species, and a more
   detailed analysis of 177 mammal species, we show the extremely high
   degree of population decay in vertebrates, even in common “species of
   low concern.” Dwindling population sizes and range shrinkages amount to
   a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem
   services essential to civilization. This “biological annihilation”
   underlines the seriousness for humanity of Earth’s ongoing sixth mass
   extinction event.

Abstract

   The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a
   quantitative viewpoint, that Earth’s sixth mass extinction is more
   severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions.
   Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population
   extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on
   analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of
   population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of
   27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting
   the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species.
   We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is
   extremely high—even in “species of low concern.” In our sample,
   comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32% (8,851/27,600)
   are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and
   range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have
   lost 30% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40% of the
   species have experienced severe population declines (>80% range
   shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions
   Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and
   extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on
   ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We
   describe this as a “biological annihilation” to highlight the current
   magnitude of Earth’s ongoing sixth major extinction event.

   The loss of biological diversity is one of the most severe human-caused
   global environmental problems. Hundreds of species and myriad
   populations are being driven to extinction every year (1⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–8). From
   the perspective of geological time, Earth’s richest biota ever is
   already well into a sixth mass extinction episode (9⇓⇓⇓⇓–14). Mass
   extinction episodes detected in the fossil record have been measured in
   terms of rates of global extinctions of species or higher taxa (e.g.,
   ref. 9). For example, conservatively almost 200 species of vertebrates
   have gone extinct in the last 100 y. These represent the loss of about
   2 species per year. Few realize, however, that if subjected to the
   estimated “background” or “normal” extinction rate prevailing in the
   last 2 million years, the 200 vertebrate species losses would have
   taken not a century, but up to 10,000 y to disappear, depending on the
   animal group analyzed (11). Considering the marine realm, specifically,
   only 15 animal species have been recorded as globally extinct (15),
   likely an underestimate, given the difficulty of accurately recording
   marine extinctions. Regarding global extinction of invertebrates,
   available information is limited and largely focused on threat level.
   For example, it is estimated that 42% of 3,623 terrestrial invertebrate
   species, and 25% of 1,306 species of marine invertebrates assessed on
   the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are
   classified as threatened with extinction (16). However, from the
   perspective of a human lifetime it is difficult to appreciate the
   current magnitude of species extinctions. A rate of two vertebrate
   species extinctions per year does not generate enough public concern,
   especially because many of those species were obscure and had limited
   ranges, such as the Catarina pupfish (Megupsilon aporus, extinct in
   2014), a tiny fish from Mexico, or the Christmas Island pipistrelle
   (Pipistrellus murrayi, extinct in 2009), a bat that vanished from its
   namesake volcanic remnant.

   Species extinctions are obviously very important in the long run,
   because such losses are irreversible and may have profound effects
   ranging from the depletion of Earth’s inspirational and esthetic
   resources to deterioration of ecosystem function and services (e.g.,
   refs. 17⇓⇓–20). The strong focus among scientists on species
   extinctions, however, conveys a common impression that Earth’s biota is
   not dramatically threatened, or is just slowly entering an episode of
   major biodiversity loss that need not generate deep concern now (e.g.,
   ref. 21, but see also refs. 9, 11, 22). Thus, there might be sufficient
   time to address the decay of biodiversity later, or to develop
   technologies for “deextinction”—the possibility of the latter being an
   especially dangerous misimpression (see ref. 23). Specifically, this
   approach has led to the neglect of two critical aspects of the present
   extinction episode: (i) the disappearance of populations, which
   essentially always precedes species extinctions, and (ii) the rapid
   decrease in numbers of individuals within some of the remaining
   populations. A detailed analysis of the loss of individuals and
   populations makes the problem much clearer and more worrisome, and
   highlights a whole set of parameters that are increasingly critical in
   considering the Anthropocene’s biological extinction crisis.

   In the last few decades, habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive
   organisms, pollution, toxification, and more recently climate
   disruption, as well as the interactions among these factors, have led
   to the catastrophic declines in both the numbers and sizes of
   populations of both common and rare vertebrate species (24⇓⇓⇓–28). For
   example, several species of mammals that were relatively safe one or
   two decades ago are now endangered. In 2016, there were only 7,000
   cheetahs in existence (29) and less than 5,000 Borneo and Sumatran
   orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and P. abelli, respectively) (28).
   Populations of African lion (Panthera leo) dropped 43% since 1993 (30),
   pangolin (Manis spp.) populations have been decimated (31), and
   populations of giraffes dropped from around 115,000 individuals thought
   to be conspecific in 1985, to around 97,000 representing what is now
   recognized to be four species (Giraffa giraffa, G. tippelskirchi, G.
   reticulata, and G. camelopardalis) in 2015 (32).

   An important antecedent to our work (25) used the number of genetic
   populations per unit area and then estimated potential loss on the
   basis of deforestation estimates and the species–area relationship
   (SAR). Given the recognized limitations of the use of SAR to estimate
   extinctions, our work provides an approach based on reduction of
   species range as a proxy of population extirpation. The most recent
   Living Planet Index (LPI) has estimated that wildlife abundance on the
   planet decreased by as much as 58% between 1970 and 2012 (4). The
   present study is different from LPI and other related publications in
   several ways, including that here we use all decreasing species of
   vertebrates according to IUCN, mapping and comparing absolute and
   relative numbers of species, and focusing on population losses.
   Previous estimates seem validated by the data we present here on the
   loss of local populations and the severe decrease in the population
   size of many others (see also refs. 3, 4, 6⇓–8, 26). Here we examine
   the magnitude of losses of populations of land vertebrate species on a
   global system of 10,000-km^2 quadrats (Methods). Species vary from
   common to rare, so that our analysis, which includes all land
   vertebrate species (amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals) deemed as
   “decreasing” by IUCN, provides a better estimate of population losses
   than using exclusively IUCN data on species at risk. Obviously, common
   species decreasing are not ordinarily classified as species at risk.
   IUCN criteria provide quantitative thresholds for population size,
   trend, and range size, to determine decreasing species (28, 33). We
   also evaluate shrinking ranges and population declines for 177 species
   of mammals for which data are available on geographic range shrinkage
   from ∼1900 to 2015. We specifically focus on local extinctions by
   addressing the following questions: (i) What are the numbers and
   geographic distributions of decreasing terrestrial vertebrate species
   (i.e., experiencing population losses)? (ii) What are the vertebrate
   groups and geographic regions that have the highest numbers and
   proportions of decreasing species? (iii) What is the scale of local
   population declines in mammals—a proxy for other vertebrates? By
   addressing these questions, we conclude that anthropogenic population
   extinctions amount to a massive erosion of the greatest biological
   diversity in the history of Earth and that population losses and
   declines are especially important, because it is populations of
   organisms that primarily supply the ecosystem services so critical to
   humanity at local and regional levels.

Results

Patterns of Variation in Population Loss Among Vertebrates.

   Considering all land vertebrates, our spatially explicit analyses
   indicate a massive pulse of population losses, with a global epidemic
   of species declines. Those analyses support the view that the decay of
   vertebrate animal life is widespread geographically, crosses
   phylogenetic lineages, and involves species ranging in abundance from
   common to rare (Figs. 1–4). The losses, however, are not uniform: some
   regions exhibit higher concentrations of species with local population
   extinctions than others, including a strong latitudinal signal
   corresponding to an intertropical peak (i.e., roughly between the
   Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) of number of decreasing species,
   particularly strong in mammals and birds, which largely drive the
   overall land vertebrate pattern (Fig. 3, Center). Notably, some parts
   of the planet harbor low absolute numbers of vertebrate species
   undergoing decline (Figs. 2 and 3), such as those areas of low species
   richness located in hypercold (northernmost locations, particularly of
   the Western Hemisphere) and hyperarid (Saharan Africa and Central Asia)
   regions. However, it is instructive to examine their corresponding
   proportional numbers, an aspect we discuss in detail in another section
   below.

   Decreasing land vertebrates, as exemplified with these four species,

   conservation status, current geographic range, and abundance are from
   IUCN (28). Barn swallow image courtesy of Daniel Garza Galindo

   the proportion of decreasing species per quadrat shows a strong
   high-latitude and Saharan Africa signal. In addition, there are several
   centers of population decline in both absolute and relative terms
   (Borneo, for example).

   Latitudinal distribution of species richness (Left), decreasing species

   latitude are similar in all vertebrates, although there are more
   species per quadrat in birds and mammals and, as expected, a scarcity
   of reptiles and amphibians at high latitudes. The patterns of number of
   species with decreasing populations indicate that regions with high
   species richness also have high numbers of decreasing species, but the
   percentage of decreasing species in relation to species richness shows
   contrasting patterns between mammals and birds compared with reptiles
   and amphibians. In mammals and birds, the percentage of decreasing
   species is relatively similar in regions with low and high species
   richness. In contrast, there are proportionally more decreasing species
   of reptiles and amphibians in regions with low species richness.

   The percentage of decreasing species classified by IUCN as “endangered”
   (including “critically endangered,” “endangered,” “vulnerable,” and
   “near-threatened”) or “low concern” (including “low concern” and
   “data-deficient”) in terrestrial vertebrates. This figure emphasizes
   that even species that have not yet been classified as endangered
   (roughly 30% in the case of all vertebrates) are declining. This
   situation is exacerbated in the case of birds, for which close to 55%
   of the decreasing species are still classified as “low concern.”

   The number of decreasing species of all land vertebrates in each of the
   10,000-km^2 quadrats over Earth’s land surface ranges from a few to
   more than 365 (Fig. 2). As expected, large concentrations of decreasing
   vertebrate species occur in species-rich areas of moist tropical
   forests adjacent to mountainous regions, such as the Andes–Amazon
   region, the Congo basin-adjacent eastern African highlands, and the
   Himalayas–south Asian jungle belt. The distribution of the number of
   decreasing species considering vertebrate classes separately reveals
   notable differences. First, the maximum number of decreasing species in
   a 10,000-km^2 quadrat varies from a high value of 296 decreasing birds
   per quadrat, to a low maximum of 60 decreasing reptiles in a quadrat.
   Second, mammals and birds have relatively similar distribution patterns
   of decreasing species, except that birds have more decreasing species
   in the temperate zones. Third, mammals and birds have patterns of
   decreasing species quite distinct from those of reptiles and amphibians
   (Figs. 2 and 3), given that the latter are rarer in the northern and
   southern temperate and subpolar regions (both are essentially absent
   from the Arctic and are missing from the Antarctic). Fourth, reptiles
   and amphibians clearly differ from each other in regions where
   decreasing species are concentrated. For example, there are more
   decreasing reptiles in the Eurasian and African continents, and more
   decreasing amphibians in the Americas.

   There is also great variation in the total population size and
   geographic ranges among individual species. Although there is no
   accurate information on population size for most taxa, whatever is
   available indicates that the total population size in species with
   decreasing populations varies from fewer than 100 individuals in
   critically endangered species such as the Hainan black-crested gibbon
   (Nomascus hainanus), to many millions of individuals in decreasing
   common species such as the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Similarly,
   the smallest ranges (i.e., <1 km^2) are seen in species such as the
   Carrizal seedeater (Amaurospiza carrizalensis) from Venezuela and
   Herrera’s false coral snake (Lampropeltis herrerae) from Mexico, both
   denizens of tiny islands. The largest ranges are hundreds of thousands
   of square kilometers, as in the bush dog (Speothos venaticus) from
   South America and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) from Eurasia.
   The sum of the 10,000-km^2 quadrats representing the current ranges of
   the 8,851 decreasing vertebrate species is 1,350,876 quadrats. A highly
   conservative estimate would indicate a similar number of local
   populations facing extinction. This is, of course, a very rough
   estimate of the total number of populations, as the number of
   populations of a decreasing species in each quadrat largely depends,
   aside from suitable habitat distribution within the quadrat, on animal
   body mass and trophic position (e.g., ref. 34). The assumption of one
   population per 10,000 km^2 might seem very conservative, as this area
   could accommodate many populations of small animals (e.g., 0.1-kg
   rodents), most of which could have been extirpated. However, 10,000
   km^2 may not be sufficient for, or can barely accommodate a viable
   population of large carnivores (say a 330-kg Siberian tiger; ref. 34).
   Nonetheless, our results provide evidence of the extremely large
   numbers of vertebrate populations facing extinction, compared with the
   number of species.

Proportion of Vertebrate Species Decreasing.

   The proportion of decreasing vertebrates shows that there are areas
   across the planet with high concentrations of decreasing species in all
   vertebrates and regions with high proportions of decreasing species of
   a particular group (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). For example, in mammals, the
   highest percentage of decreasing species is concentrated in tropical
   regions, mostly in the Neotropics and Southeast Asia, whereas in
   reptiles, the proportional decline concentrates almost exclusively in
   Madagascar. Decreasing amphibians are prominent in Mexico, Central
   America, the northern Andes, and Brazil’s Atlantic forest in the
   Americas; West Africa and Madagascar in Africa; and India and Southeast
   Asia, including Indonesia and Philippines in Asia–Southeast Asia.
   Finally, decreasing species of birds are found over large regions of
   all continents (Fig. 2).

   Fig. 5.

   The percentage of species of land mammals from five major
   continents/subcontinents and the entire globe undergoing different
   degrees (in percentage) of decline in the period ∼1900–2015.
   Considering the sampled species globally, 56% of them have lost more
   than 60% of their range, a pattern that is generally consistent in
   Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe, whereas in South America and North
   America, 35–40% of the species have experienced range contractions of
   only 20% or less. (See text for details.)

   Roughly a third (8,851/27,600) of all land vertebrate species examined
   are experiencing declines and local population losses of a considerable
   magnitude (Figs. 2–4). Such proportion of decreasing species varies,
   depending on the taxonomic group, from 30% or more in the case of
   mammals, birds, and reptiles, to 15% in the case of amphibians.
   Furthermore, of the decreasing species, many are now considered
   endangered (Fig. 4). Beyond that, roughly 30% of all decreasing species
   are still sufficiently common that they are considered of “low concern”
   by IUCN, rather than “endangered.” That so many common species are
   decreasing is a strong sign of the seriousness of the overall
   contemporary biological extinction episode.

   In our 10,000-km^2 quadrats, the proportion of decreasing species
   ranges from less than 10% to more than 50% (Fig. 2). The geographic
   distributions of absolute (i.e., number) and relative (i.e.,
   percentage) of decreasing species is contrasting. Whereas tropical
   regions have larger numbers of decreasing species, as expected, given
   their higher species richness, their corresponding proportions are
   relatively low. In contrast, temperate regions tend to have similar or
   higher proportions of decreasing species, a trend dramatically
   prominent in the case of reptiles.

Local Population Extinctions in Mammals.

   Our most detailed data allow comparison of historic and present
   geographic range of a sample of 177 mammal species (Figs. 5 and 6).
   Most of the 177 mammal species we sampled have lost more than 40% of
   their geographic ranges in historic times, and almost half have lost
   more than 80% of their ranges in the period ∼1900–2015. At the
   continental and subcontinental level, some patterns become evident
   (Fig. 5). The predominant category of range contraction is ≥80% in
   Africa (56% of the sampled mammal species), Asia (75% of the species),
   Australia (60% of the species), and Europe (40% of the species). In the
   Americas, range contractions are less marked but still considerable:
   22% of the species in North America and 17% of the species in South
   America have experienced range contractions of at least 80%.
   Nevertheless, 50% of the species in North America and 28% of the
   species in South America have experienced a range contraction of 41% or
   more.

   Fig. 6.

   Percentage of local population extinction in 177 species of mammals in
   1° × 1° quadrats, as an indication of the severity of the mass
   extinction crises. The maps were generated by comparing historic and
   current geographic ranges (49) (SI Appendix, SI Methods). Note that
   large regions in all continents have lost 50% or more of the
   populations of the evaluated mammals. Because of the small sample size,
   biased to large mammal species, this figure can only be used to
   visualize likely trends in population losses.

   The comparison of the 1900–2015 geographic ranges showed that the 177
   species of mammals have disappeared from 58,000 grid cells. On the
   assumption that on average each of the 10,000-km^2 occupied quadrats
   held a single population of the species found within it, this implies
   that roughly 58,000 populations of the 177 mammals we examined have
   gone extinct. Consider the following emblematic cases: The lion
   (Panthera leo) was historically distributed over most of Africa,
   southern Europe, and the Middle East, all the way to northwestern India
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). It is now confined to scattered populations in
   sub-Saharan Africa and a remnant population in the Gir forest of India.
   The vast majority of lion populations are gone. In its African
   stronghold, it historically occupied roughly two thousand 10,000-km^2
   cells, and now it is reduced to some 600 cells. Other species, such as
   the mountain lion (Puma concolor), are known to be doing better. The
   mountain lion has lost some of its local populations in North America,
   but has not suffered such disastrous losses as its Old World relative,
   adapting relatively well to human-dominated landscapes, and it is still
   found across 85% of its historic range.

   Clearly, the extinction of mammal populations, although varying from
   species to species, has been a global phenomenon (Fig. 6). Strikingly,
   the predominant color code in the mammalian map is that of 70% or more
   of population losses, with the exception of some areas of South America
   and high latitudes of North America. Particularly hard hit have been
   the mammals of south and southeast Asia, where all of the large-bodied
   species of mammals analyzed have lost more than 80% of their geographic
   ranges. The Cape and Sahara regions in Africa, central Australia, the
   eastern United States, and the Atlantic forest in South America have
   also suffered severely from population extinctions.

Discussion

   It has recently been shown, using conservative estimates of current and
   background species extinction rates, that Earth is now in a period of
   mass global species extinction for vertebrate animals (11). But the
   true extent of this mass extinction has been underestimated, because of
   the emphasis on species extinction. This underestimate largely traces
   to overlooking the accelerating extinction of populations. Whereas
   scientists have known for a long time that several relatively
   well-studied species have undergone major contraction of their ranges,
   experienced considerable population decreases, and suffered many
   population extinctions, the global extent of population shrinkage and
   extirpation has previously not been recognized and quantified.

   In addition, some studies document that invertebrates and plants are
   suffering massive losses of populations and species (35⇓⇓–38). Here we
   extend investigation of mass extinction to terrestrial vertebrate
   population decreases and losses, and give estimates of the number of
   their species with decreasing populations. The accuracy of the
   estimates is strongly dependent on an unknown parameter, namely, the
   actual average area occupied by a vertebrate population (e.g., refs.
   35, 39⇓–41). However, even if a population would, on average, occupy an
   area five times larger than what we have used here (i.e., 50,000 km^2)
   there would still be hundreds of thousands of populations that have
   suffered extinction in the past few centuries. On the other hand, most
   vertebrates (∼70%) are small species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and
   amphibians. If, on average, they have one population every 10 km^2 then
   vertebrates would have suffered more than a billion population
   extinctions.

   Our results show that population extinction in land vertebrates is
   geographically omnipresent, but with notable prominence in tropical,
   species-rich regions. It is interesting, however, that when population
   extinctions are evaluated as the percentage of total species richness,
   temperate regions, with their typical low species diversity, show
   higher proportions of population loss.

   There are some illustrative qualitative examples of population
   decreases and their consequences within terrestrial and marine
   vertebrates, but ours is an attempt at a quantitative evaluation of
   global trends in population extinctions. Recent reviews indicate that
   species extinctions, population decreases, and range contraction
   (implying population extinctions) among terrestrial invertebrates and
   plants are as severe as among vertebrates (e.g., refs. 35⇓⇓–38). For
   example, long-term monitoring of insect populations in the United
   Kingdom shows that 30–60% of species per taxonomic order have
   contracting ranges (36). The situation in plants has been less
   evaluated; thus it is difficult to compare them with animals, but there
   is little reason to believe that the extinction situation in plants is
   dramatically different (37). Furthermore, research shows that the loss
   of animal populations indirectly leads to changes in plant communities
   (20, 37, 39), frequently causing the reduction of local species
   richness and dominance of a few plant taxa that either experience
   “ecological release” in response to decreasing herbivore pressures (42,
   43), and/or experience population reductions due to the decline of
   animals responsible for pollination or dispersal (e.g., refs. 2−3, 20).
   The status of biodiversity among microorganisms is too poorly known to
   permit us to make any comparison and generalizations about the current
   pulse of extinctions, although some recent research has unraveled
   feedbacks between local large herbivore defaunation and mycorrhizal
   richness (44, 45). Given what we know about genetic population
   differentiation, it is expected that the range contractions and
   declines we document here imply a considerable loss of intraspecific
   genetic diversity (23) but this is, clearly, an aspect that warrants
   further investigation.

   In sum, by losing populations (and species) of vertebrates, we are
   losing intricate ecological networks involving animals, plants, and
   microorganisms (e.g., refs. 2, 8, 18, 45, 46). We are also losing pools
   of genetic information that may prove vital to species’ evolutionary
   adjustment and survival in a rapidly changing global environment. This
   suggests that, even if there was not ample sign that the crisis extends
   far beyond that group of animals, today’s planetary defaunation of
   vertebrates will itself promote cascading catastrophic effects on
   ecosystems, worsening the annihilation of nature (2, 3, 46). Thus,
   while the biosphere is undergoing mass species extinction (11), it is
   also being ravaged by a much more serious and rapid wave of population
   declines and extinctions. In combination, these assaults are causing a
   vast reduction of the fauna and flora of our planet. The resulting
   biological annihilation obviously will also have serious ecological,
   economic, and social consequences (46). Humanity will eventually pay a
   very high price for the decimation of the only assemblage of life that
   we know of in the universe.

Conclusion

   Population extinctions today are orders of magnitude more frequent than
   species extinctions. Population extinctions, however, are a prelude to
   species extinctions, so Earth’s sixth mass extinction episode has
   proceeded further than most assume. The massive loss of populations is
   already damaging the services ecosystems provide to civilization. When
   considering this frightening assault on the foundations of human
   civilization, one must never forget that Earth’s capacity to support
   life, including human life, has been shaped by life itself (47). When
   public mention is made of the extinction crisis, it usually focuses on
   a few animal species (hundreds out of millions) known to have gone
   extinct, and projecting many more extinctions in the future. But a
   glance at our maps presents a much more realistic picture: they suggest
   that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once
   shared Earth with us are already gone, as are billions of populations.
   Furthermore, our analysis is conservative, given the increasing
   trajectories of the drivers of extinction and their synergistic
   effects. Future losses easily may amount to a further rapid defaunation
   of the globe and comparable losses in the diversity of plants (36),
   including the local (and eventually global) defaunation-driven
   coextinction of plants (3, 20). The likelihood of this rapid
   defaunation lies in the proximate causes of population extinctions:
   habitat conversion, climate disruption, overexploitation, toxification,
   species invasions, disease, and (potentially) large-scale nuclear
   war—all tied to one another in complex patterns and usually reinforcing
   each other’s impacts. Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the
   ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction,
   namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and
   overconsumption, especially by the rich. These drivers, all of which
   trace to the fiction that perpetual growth can occur on a finite
   planet, are themselves increasing rapidly. Thus, we emphasize that the
   sixth mass extinction is already here and the window for effective
   action is very short, probably two or three decades at most (11, 48).
   All signs point to ever more powerful assaults on biodiversity in the
   next two decades, painting a dismal picture of the future of life,
   including human life.

Methods

   For full methods, please see SI Appendix. We determined the number of
   decreasing vertebrate species using the IUCN (28) Red List of
   Threatened Species. In the IUCN, species are classified as decreasing,
   stable, or increasing (see also ref. 33). Either range contraction
   (population extinction) or reduction in numbers in extant populations
   determines whether a species is decreasing. We used the IUCN maps of
   terrestrial vertebrates (i.e., mammals, birds, reptiles, and
   amphibians) to create the global maps of number of species (richness)
   and of decreasing species, and percentage of decreasing species in
   relation to total species richness. The distribution of all of the
   species was superimposed in a 22,000 grid of 10,000-km^2 quadrats
   covering the continental lands. For the grid, a Lambert azimuthal
   equal-area projection was used (see ref. 49 for details of the
   projection methods). In our analyses a critical issue is how grid
   squares and populations correspond. This is a very difficult problem
   that varies with definitions of species. (In this paper, we stick with
   the classic biological definition of species.) The number of
   populations also varies from species to species; for example, a highly
   phylopatric species would have more populations per square than a very
   vagile species, and species with different mating systems would have
   different estimates of numbers of Mendelian populations, and these
   would not be the same as estimates of number of demographic units (50).
   For the purposes of understanding the annihilation, these differences
   are not critical. For example, if we have lost 90% of the lion’s
   geographic range, whether this amounts to 10,000 demographic units or
   4,000 Mendelian populations is trivial in the present context. It would
   be extremely useful if we had much more information on population
   structure for all vertebrates, but this is a major, pending agenda.

   The population extinction analysis was conducted on 177 mammalian
   species occurring on five continents. Specifically, we analyzed 54
   species in Africa, 14 in Asia, 57 in Australia, 15 in Europe, and 35 in
   America. The historical distribution was gathered from specialized
   literature (see details in ref. 26) and the current distribution from
   IUCN (28). Historic and current ranges were digitized as geographic
   information system polygons and elaborated in ArcGis 10.1 (51). For
   each species, we calculated the area of the historical and present
   distribution (in square kilometers) to estimate the percentage of lost
   area and the percentage of area where the species are extant. A caveat
   of these estimates regards how representative the sample of 177 species
   is. We recognize a bias in that the data include a large number of
   medium- and large-sized species, for which the best information is
   available. However, given that such medium and large species are the
   most seriously threatened by the predominant proximate drivers of
   defaunation (2, 3), the likely bias against small-sized species should
   not affect our overall interpretation of results.

Abstract

   Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental
   impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for
   crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of
   alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita
   demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all
   crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita
   real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110% increase
   in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show
   that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how
   global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural
   intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing
   (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of
   land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO[2]-C equivalent
   greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y^−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y^−1 by
   then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate
   intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations,
   adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these
   croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast
   land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1
   Gt y^−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y^−1. Efficient management
   practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high
   yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great
   importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal
   environmental impacts.

   Global demand for agricultural crops is increasing, and may continue to
   do so for decades, propelled by a 2.3 billion person increase in global
   population and greater per capita incomes anticipated through
   midcentury (1). Both land clearing and more intensive use of existing
   croplands could contribute to the increased crop production needed to
   meet such demand, but the environmental impacts and tradeoffs of these
   alternative paths of agricultural expansion are unclear (1, 2).
   Agriculture already has major global environmental impacts: land
   clearing and habitat fragmentation threaten biodiversity (3), about
   one-quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from land
   clearing, crop production, and fertilization (4), and fertilizer can
   harm marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems (5). Understanding
   the future environmental impacts of global crop production and how to
   achieve greater yields with lower impacts requires quantitative
   assessments of future crop demand and how different production
   practices affect yields and environmental variables.

   Here, we forecast 2050 global crop demand and then quantitatively
   evaluate the global impacts on land clearing, nitrogen fertilizer use,
   and GHG release of alternative approaches by which this global crop
   demand might be achieved. To do these analyses, we compiled annual
   agricultural and population data for 1961–2007 obtained from the
   FAOSTAT database (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
   Nations; http://faostat.fao.org/) and other sources (SI Materials and
   Methods) for each of 100 large nations that comprised 91% of the 2006
   global population (Table S1). We then calculated net national demand
   for crop calories and crop protein for each nation for each year based
   on national annual yields, production, imports, and exports of 275
   major crops (those crops used as human foods or livestock and fish
   feeds) (Table S2). The resultant per capita demand for calories or
   protein from all food or feed crops combined (SI Materials and Methods)
   encompasses annual human crop consumption, crop use for livestock and
   fish production, and all losses (waste and spoilage during food and
   crop production, storage, transport, and manufacturing). To determine
   long-term global trends and better control for economic differences
   among nations, nations were aggregated into seven economic groups
   ranging from highest (Group A) to lowest (Group G) national average per
   capita real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) (Table
   S1).

Results and Discussion

Global Crop Demand.

   Analyses reveal a simple and temporally consistent global relationship
   between per capita GDP and per capita demand for crop calories or
   protein. Across all years, per capita crop use was similarly dependent
   on per capita GDP both within and among the seven economic groups (Fig.
   1). The magnitude of this dependence is surprisingly large. In 2000,
   for example, per capita use of calories and protein by the richest
   nations (Group A) were 256% and 430% greater, respectively, than use by
   the poorest nations (Groups F and G). These large differences in crop
   demand partially result from greater dietary meat consumption at higher
   income (6, 7) and the low efficiency with which some types of livestock
   convert crop calories and protein into edible foods (8).

   Annual dependence of per capita demand for (A) crop calories and (B)
   protein on per capita real GDP for each of economic Groups A–G (SI
   Materials and Methods). Each color of points shows the trajectory for a
   particular economic group (one point per year for each group). Curves
   are fitted to the square root of per capita GDP.

   We suggest that the observed relationships between per capita crop use
   and per capita real GDP (Fig. 1) provide a means of forecasting future
   crop demand. Specifically, using the fitted curves in Fig. 1, we
   forecasted per capita crop caloric and protein demand for 2050 for each
   economic group by its estimated 2050 per capita GDP (Fig. 2 B and C)
   (Table S3). The GDP estimate (SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S1)
   assumes that per capita real GDP would grow at ∼2.5% per year globally,
   with rates for developing nations being greater than developed nations
   (Fig. 2A). Using United Nations (UN) projections of 2050 population (9)
   (Fig. S2), we next calculated the total 2050 demand for crop calories
   or crop protein for each economic group and then summed these values to
   estimate 2050 global crop demand (SI Materials and Methods).

   (A) Per capita GDP, (B) per capita demand for crop calories, and (C)
   per capita demand for crop protein in 2005 (black) and mean projected
   2050 increases (white; percent increases above bars).

   These analyses forecast that global demand for crop calories would
   increase by 100% ± 11% and global demand for crop protein would
   increase by 110% ± 7% (mean ± SE) from 2005 to 2050 (Table S3). This
   projected doubling is lower than the 176% (caloric) and 238% (protein)
   increases in global crop use that would occur if per capita demands of
   all nations in 2050 reached the 2005 levels of Group A nations.

   Any projection of future global crop production entails many elements
   of uncertainty and of necessity emphasizes some potentially causative
   factors over others. Our forecast of a 100–110% increase in global crop
   production by 2050 is larger than the 70% increase that has been
   projected for this same period (10). Although our projection methods
   and the methods of the earlier study differ in many ways, the different
   forecasts may occur because of our use of quantitative global trends in
   per capita crop demand that emphasize income-dependent dietary choices
   (Fig. 1) vs. their use of expert opinion of national and regional
   demand trends (10).

Quantification of Yield, Input, and Climate Relationships.

   The environmental impacts of doubling global crop production will
   depend on how increased production is achieved (11, 12). Production
   could be increased by agricultural extensification (that is, clearing
   additional land for crop production) or intensification (that is,
   achieving higher yields through increased inputs, improved agronomic
   practices, improved crop varieties, and other innovations). Here, we
   quantify the global impacts on land clearing, GHG emissions, and
   nitrogen fertilization of alternative pathways of agricultural
   development that meet the 2050 global crop production that we forecast.
   In particular, we evaluate the combinations of current or improved
   agricultural technologies, enhancements to soil fertility, and land
   clearing that could meet our projected 2050 global caloric demand and
   what their environmental impacts would be. For brevity, results for
   protein are not presented here but are similar. Because of data
   availability, we use past N fertilization rates as quantitative
   measures of soil fertility enhancement, but we emphasize that soil
   fertility can also be enhanced by legumes, cover crops, and other means
   and that yields could increase with less N fertilizer than in the past
   if N use efficiency increases (1, 2, 13).

   We used multiple regressions to quantify how nation to nation and year
   to year differences in caloric yields have been related to N
   fertilization intensity (N ha^−1) and other variables that are thought
   to impact yields (SI Materials and Methods). We found that caloric
   yields were simultaneously related to N fertilization intensity,
   precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil pH, elevation, time
   (year), and economic group (Table S4). A simpler regression that
   included just N fertilization intensity, precipitation, economic group,
   and time gave similar results (Table S4). Two otherwise similar
   regressions used just 2005 data (Table S5).

   These four regressions show that ∼80% of national-level variation in
   caloric yields was statistically explained by a few underlying
   variables. We use these fitted relationships to quantify scenarios,
   exploring the potential effects of changes in these variables on
   caloric yields and the environment. We do so with the caveat that the
   fitted relationships need not be indicative of causation, while noting
   that fits are consistent with other analyses of controls of yields (12,
   14, 15).

   After controlling for N fertilization intensity, climate, soil, and
   elevation in these regressions, we will, for brevity, refer to the
   residual yield differences ascribed to economic groups as mainly
   reflecting technological and infrastructure disparities among the
   economic groups, and we will refer to the residual yield differences
   that are ascribed to time (year) as mainly reflecting technological
   improvements from 1965 to 2005.

Alternative Pathways of Agricultural Expansion.

   These regressions can estimate the dependence of global yields on N use
   (soil fertility enhancement) if future technological advances were to
   continue along observed temporal trends to 2050 (technology
   improvement), if underyielding nations were to overcome technological
   disparities by adapting and then adopting the high-yielding
   technologies of Group A nations (technology transfer), or if both
   technology improvement and technology transfer were to occur. In
   particular, we used our regression results to quantify curves defining
   the dependence of global caloric yields on global N use for four cases
   that all meet our projected 2050 crop caloric demand forecast (Fig. 3A
   and SI Materials and Methods). For all cases, we assumed that the
   currently large disparities among nations in agricultural intensities
   (measured here as N ha^−1) were eliminated by 2050. We call this
   equalization of N use strategic N utilization, because it provides a
   larger increase in global crop production per unit of N than would
   occur from greater N use in nations already applying N at high rates.

   trajectories along which agriculture might develop by 2050. Tonnes
   CO[2]e in (C) and (F) represents the equivalent tonnes of C that would
   have been emitted had all GHG emissions in our analyses been in the
   form of CO[2]. All abscissas are global annual N use in 2050 calculated
   as the sum across all economic groups of N use intensity (N ha^−1)
   times total cropland area (ha) needed to meet projected 2050 caloric
   demand. To derive the curves shown, current N use intensities of
   lower-yielding nations were strategically increased to equal global
   mean intensity, which was set at 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, or 160 kg ha^−1
   to calculate the 12 points shown for each curve (SI Materials and
   Methods). The four curves shown in each graph (magenta, current
   technology; blue, improvement only; orange, technology adaptation and
   transfer only; green, improvement and technology transfer) are
   regression-based estimates of yields (A and D) and associated land
   clearing (B and E) needed to meet 2050 global caloric demand and
   resultant GHG emissions (C and F). Land clearing = (cropland needed to
   meet 2050 crop demand) − (2005 cropland).

   The current technology curve in Fig. 3 retains each economic group's
   N-dependent yield at its 2005 relationship and thus assumes no
   technological improvements or transfer from 2005 to 2050. This curve
   provides a potential lower bound for 2050 yields. It is defined by six
   data points calculated from each of the two regressions that used just
   2005 data (Table S5). These two regressions, which differ in the number
   of variables included, give results so similar to each other as to be
   almost indistinguishable in Fig. 3 A–C.

   A potential upper bound is provided by the technology improvement and
   transfer curve for which complete technology transfer is assumed to
   allow all nations to achieve (by 2050) the technological improvements
   and soil- and climate-adjusted yields projected for Group A nations by
   2050. The two regressions on which it is based also gave highly similar
   predictions (Fig. 3 A–C and Table S4).

   Two intermediate curves, each defined by two regressions, provide
   benchmarks within the region defined by the upper and lower bounds. The
   technology improvement curve assumes that yields continue to increase
   until 2050 along the 1965–2005 time trajectory (Table S4) but that all
   nations otherwise retain the technology of their economic group. The
   technology transfer curve has each nation, based on its climate and
   soils, achieve (in 2050) the climate- and soil-adjusted N-dependent
   yield of Group A nations in 2005 (Table S5). All four curves in Fig. 3
   explore what might occur should lower-yielding nations achieve, by
   2050, significant soil fertility enhancements (here quantified by
   increased N use but potentially achievable by other means).

   Any point in the shaded region of Fig. 3A represents different
   combinations of technology improvement and technology transfer that,
   for the given global N use or its equivalent soil fertility
   enhancement, would meet global caloric demand in 2050. The increased
   global yields that could result from various degrees of technology
   improvement, technology transfer, or N use would meet 2050 crop demand
   with less cropland clearing (1, 2) (Fig. 3B). For instance, if global N
   use were held at 200 Mt, achieving the technology transfer and
   improvement benchmark by 2050 would decrease land clearing by ∼1.2
   billion ha compared with current yields (Fig. 3B).

   Land clearing, soil cultivation, and N fertilizer manufacturing and use
   all emit GHG. We quantified global emissions from these sources for
   each curve using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier
   1 methods (16, 17) (SI Materials and Methods and Tables S6 and S7).
   Although estimates of N[2]O emissions that result from N fertilizer are
   variable (18), such variability is small compared with the other
   sources of emissions that we quantified. Our analyses found that, when
   increased global N is focused on croplands of underyielding nations,
   projected global 2050 net GHG emissions are reduced, as shown by the
   negative slopes for each of the four curves of Fig. 3C. Reduced GHG
   emissions occurred because increased N use decreased land clearing. The
   resultant reduction in GHG emissions from lower land clearing was
   approximately three times the emissions increase from the N fertilizer.

Environmental Impacts of Meeting Increased Crop Demand.

   These relationships among global N use, yield, land clearing, and GHG
   emissions allow exploration of the environmental impacts of different
   pathways of global agricultural development. Four hypothetical pathways
   that start on the current technology curve at the 2005 global average N
   use intensity of 94 kg ha^−1 (Fig. 3 D–F) illustrate that our forecast
   of 2050 global crop demand may be met in ways that have markedly
   different environmental impacts. First, consider a pathway that mimics
   past trends (black arrows), with poorer, lower-yielding nations
   increasing crop production mainly through land clearing and richer,
   higher-yielding nations doing so mainly by yield increases from
   intensification and yield improvement. The environmental impacts of
   this past trend trajectory would, as illustrated, increase global land
   clearing to a total of ∼1 billion ha by 2050, global agricultural GHG
   emissions to ∼3 Gt y^−1 of CO[2]-carbon equivalents, and global N use
   to ∼250 Mt y^−1. These increases would have major environmental impacts
   through resultant species extinctions, loss of ecosystem services,
   elevated atmospheric GHG levels, and water pollution (3–5, 19).

   Greater global investments in technology improvement and technology
   adaptation and transfer could markedly reduce these impacts, as
   illustrated by the other three trajectories, all of which attain the
   technology improvement and technology adaptation and transfer frontier
   by 2050. For instance, the N-minimizing trajectory shown (brown arrows)
   (Fig. 3 D–F) could retain global N use at its current 100 Mt y^−1, have
   land clearing of ∼0.5 billion ha, and have GHG emissions of 1.6 Gt
   y^−1. Alternatively, a current N-intensity trajectory (yellow arrows),
   with global N intensity staying at 94 kg ha^−1 until 2050, would move
   global values to N use of ∼125 Mt, land clearing of ∼0.4 billion ha,
   and GHG emissions of ∼1.4 Gt y^−1 in 2050.

   A land sparing trajectory (white arrows) would minimize both land
   clearing and GHG emissions. It could meet our 2050 projected global
   crop demand while clearing only ∼0.2 billion ha land globally and
   producing global GHG emissions of just ∼1 Gt y^−1. Global N use would
   be ∼225 Mt y^−1. This analysis suggests that a land sparing trajectory
   of agricultural development might be the best option for minimizing
   biodiversity loss and GHG emissions, but it comes with the
   environmental cost associated with greater global N use.

   However, a variety of practices can greatly decrease this environmental
   cost by increasing the efficiency of agricultural nitrogen utilization
   (1, 11–13, 20, 21). For instance, recent field trials of an integrated
   soil–crop management system in China achieved a 90% increase in maize
   yields with no increase in N use (13). Because N inputs in excess of
   plant uptake increase nitrate loading into surface and ground waters
   and contribute to marine anoxic zones (20, 22), greater development and
   adoption of agronomic practices that increase nutrient efficiency (23,
   24) could further decrease environmental impacts of increased yields
   (25–27).

Conclusions

   Trajectories of global agricultural development that are directed to
   greater achievement of the technology improvement and technology
   transfer frontier would meet 2050 crop demand with much lower
   environmental impacts than trajectories that were continuations of past
   trends (19). This difference occurs because strategic intensification
   that elevates yields of existing croplands of underyielding nations can
   meet the majority of 2050 global crop demand, and in so doing can
   greatly reduce land clearing and GHG emissions.

   Current yield differences among nations are large. In 2005, for
   example, caloric yields for Group A nations were 308% greater than for
   Groups F and G, 138% greater than for Group E, and 37% greater than for
   Groups B, C, and D. Our analyses, which incorporate the effects of
   climate and soils on yields, suggest that agricultural intensification
   through technology adaptation and transfer and enhancement of soil
   fertility in poorer nations would greatly reduce these yield gaps (14),
   provide a more equitable global food supply, and greatly decrease the
   GHG emissions and species extinctions that otherwise would have
   resulted from land clearing (4). Our analyses explore the implications
   of the 100% increase from 2005 to 2050 in global crop production that
   we forecast. If global crop demand were lower (10), less land clearing
   and/or N use would be needed, and environmental impacts would be
   smaller.

   Our evaluations of the environmental benefits of alternative pathways
   of global agricultural development are not meant to imply that they
   might be similarly attainable or feasible. Global yields will likely be
   impacted by climate change (15). Yield increases in richer nations may
   be more difficult than in the past if some major crops are approaching
   yield ceilings (21, 28). Yield increases in poorer nations will require
   significant investments in innovative adaptation of technologies to new
   soil types, climates, and pests (29, 30) as well as new infrastructure
   (2). However, yields have been increased in some nations in which they
   were long stagnant, such as Malawi and Zimbabwe (31, 32). In Zimbabwe,
   for instance, field trials on >1,200 farms showed that technology
   transfer (farmer education) and intensification (N fertilizer use at
   ∼13% of use by Group A nations) increased maize yields 40%, giving
   market value returns ∼400% greater than the cost of fertilization (32).

   Global food demand is growing rapidly, much of the world's current
   cropland has yields well below their potential, and the current global
   trajectory of agricultural expansion has serious long-term implications
   for the environment. The environmental impacts of escalating crop
   demand will depend on the trajectory along which global agriculture
   develops. The preservation of global biodiversity and the minimization
   of the GHG impacts of agriculture may well hinge on this trajectory. A
   trajectory that adapts and transfers technologies to underyielding
   nations, enhances their soil fertility, employs more efficient nutrient
   use worldwide, and minimizes land clearing provides a promising path to
   more environmentally sustainable agricultural intensification and more
   equitable global food supplies.

Materials and Methods

   Detailed descriptions of our data sources and analyses can be found in
   the SI Materials and Methods. These include data on political,
   economic, agricultural, and climatic variables; analyzed nations,
   economic aggregates, and global estimates; crop demand; projections of
   per capita GDP; yield regressions; four 2050 yield curves and land
   cleared curves in (Fig. 3); calculation and projections of GHG
   emissions from land use conversion; and estimation of GHG emissions
   from N fertilizer manufacture and application.

Significance

   Humans alter the water cycle by constructing dams and through water
   withdrawals. Climate change is expected to additionally affect water
   supply and demand. Here, model analyses of climate change and direct
   human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented. The results
   indicate that the impact of man-made reservoirs and water withdrawals
   on the long-term global terrestrial water balance is small. However, in
   some river basins, impacts of human interventions are significant. In
   parts of Asia and the United States, the effects of human interventions
   exceed the impacts expected for moderate levels of global warming. This
   study also identifies areas where irrigation water is currently scarce,
   and where increases in irrigation water scarcity are projected.

Abstract

   Humans directly change the dynamics of the water cycle through dams
   constructed for water storage, and through water withdrawals for
   industrial, agricultural, or domestic purposes. Climate change is
   expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses
   of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water
   cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven
   global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate
   projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human
   interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological
   cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global
   warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for
   climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human
   impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in
   the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even
   exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2
   K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water
   consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean
   temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts
   of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in
   the future.

Abstract

   Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity
   in many countries today. Expected future population changes will, in
   many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available
   water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be
   affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature,
   and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global
   hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the
   latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative
   Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about
   climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change
   is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity
   considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a
   global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2.7 °C above
   preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15% of the
   global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will
   increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity
   (<500 m^3 per capita per year) by another 40% (according to some
   models, more than 100%) compared with the effect of population growth
   alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase
   is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very
   severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the
   study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates,
   with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread.
   GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by
   declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved
   water resource projections through hydrological model development.
