Nature’s Make or Break Potential for Climate Change

Study shows we’ve been underestimating nature’s role in tackling climate
change

Key Takeaways

     * Research by The Nature Conservancy and 15 other institutions,
       published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
       demonstrates that nature-based solutions provide up to 37 percent
       of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global
       temperature increases under 2 degrees celsius-30 percent more than
       previously estimated.
     * Additionally, using only cost-effective solutions, nature's
       mitigation potential is estimated at 11.3 billion tons in 2030—the
       equivalent of stopping burning oil globally.
     * Many natural climate solutions offer additional benefits, such as
       water filtration, flood buffering, improved soil health, protection
       of habitat and enhanced climate resilience.

   Though his business card says Director of Forest Carbon Science at The
   Nature Conservancy, Bronson Griscom introduces himself as an ecological
   accountant. Griscom radiates an optimism somewhat rare in seasoned
   environmentalists, especially when he discusses the “carbon economy” of
   nature: the everyday role that trees, grasslands and coastal habitats
   play in the carbon cycle. Griscom can measure the carbon impact of
   logging in old growth forests, or how well different forest ecosystems
   work as sinks for absorbing and storing carbon from the atmosphere. He
   helps link our economy with the economy of the biosphere.

   In recent decades, forest use—Griscom’s area of expertise—has been
   widely studied for its climate impacts. Forest loss accounts for 8 to
   10 percent of carbon emissions globally; tropical rainforests like the
   Amazon have become almost synonymous with land conservation, largely
   because they work as massive carbon sinks and are home to many of the
   world’s indigenous people and endangered species.

   But other global ecosystems and managed lands—from farmlands and
   peatlands to seagrass and tidal marshes—have garnered less attention
   from climate regulators, both as a source of emissions and a potential
   mitigation solution. In fact, until recently no one had ever integrated
   the raw data on all the carbon that all ecosystems were already
   sequestering, and what the potential was for increasing carbon storage
   among all these habitats together, as Griscom and his team studied.

   Read the “Natural Climate Solutions” study in the Proceedings of the
   National Academy of the Sciences.

   “I thought we would review a few papers and take an average to answer
   the question,” he says. “We were shocked to find that important gaps
   remained in answering the question: how much can lands contribute to
   solving climate change? So we took it upon ourselves to convene a large
   group of scientists across 15 research institutions to take a
   comprehensive look at this question.”

   Answering that question became the highest priority for Bronson’s team,
   and the foundation for what has become the most comprehensive study on
   the role that nature can play in keeping global temperature increases
   to 2°C or below. They found that, with the right management, nature can
   play a bigger role than we realized.

   What are NCS? Unlocking nature's potential for climate change
   mitigation

Natural climate solutions offer up to 37% of the mitigation needed between
now and 2030 to keep global temperature rise below 2°C.

   Tapping Nature’s Full Potential

   Published on October 16 in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of
   the Sciences, the paper offers a comprehensive roadmap for reducing
   carbon emissions through nature. The study is the culmination of a
   partnership between the Conservancy and the Doris Duke Charitable
   Foundation that brought together more than two-dozen leading natural
   scientists and economists from fifteen research, educational and
   private institutions around the world.

   The land-use sector is currently responsible for a quarter of
   greenhouse gas emissions. But this new study shows that this could
   change—and with concerted global action on land use over the next
   decade, nature can be a significant part of the climate solution.

   stabilizing warming below 2 degrees celsius.

   The analysis found that the total biophysical potential for natural
   climate solutions while still taking account of food production needs
   is as much as 23.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per
   year—approximately 30 percent more than previous, less comprehensive
   estimates.

   In addition, the study’s economic analyses show that half of these
   natural climate solutions (11.3 billion tons CO2e) offer cost-effective
   mitigation opportunities, because they cost less than the future
   impacts of climate change, expected to cost society more than $100 per
   ton of CO2 in the atmosphere. These cost-effective NCS mitigation
   options offer up to 37 percent of mitigation needed between now and
   2030 to keep global temperature rise below 2°C —the widely recognized
   target of the Paris Climate Agreement.

   Pathways to Natural Climate Solutions

   To synthesize the research, Griscom and his team developed a framework
   to distill the world’s “natural climate solutions”—the proven ways of
   storing and reducing carbon emissions in forests, grasslands (including
   agricultural and rangelands) and wetlands—into a taxonomy of 20
   specific pathways that account for the full climate potential of
   nature.

   Mitigation Potential The natural climate solutions pathways and their
   greenhouse gas mitigation potential

   In addition to covering three biomes, the pathways also look at
   different practices across a variety of economic scenarios that
   mitigate climate change, including the implementation of low-cost
   opportunities only ($10 per tonne CO2e or less).

   Another striking aspect of these pathways is the additional benefits
   they provide. Most nature climate solutions—if effectively
   implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, improved soil
   health, protection of biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate
   resilience.

   “The approach is synergistic,” says Justin Adams, managing director for
   Global Lands at the Nature Conservancy. “We can hit multiple targets of
   the UN Sustainable Development Goals if we get this right.”

   There is, however, a catch: The world must act soon.

   Mobilizing Climate Action

   Assuming current business-as-usual trajectories, increased emissions
   entering the atmosphere, coupled with continued environmental
   degradation, will lessen the impact that nature can have. If natural
   climate solutions are mobilized over the next 10 to 15 years, they
   could provide 37 percent of the needed mitigation for global climate
   targets. But if action is delayed until after 2030, that number drops
   to 33 percent, and drops again to only 22 percent after 2050.

   forests. © Nick Hall

   Over the past two years, the world experienced unprecedented global
   climate momentum. In September 2015, international leaders adopted the
   UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to fight poverty,
   promote sustainability and address climate change. Shortly after,
   nearly 200 countries came together in Paris to adopt the world’s
   largest ever international climate treaty.

   And despite recent setbacks, including the United States announcing its
   intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, many countries have
   moved forward implementing voluntary measures to limit emissions. And
   while natural climate solutions are part of many countries’ pledges,
   there remains a gap between promised action and realized climate
   progress.

Natural climate solutions are available now, are cost effective and greatly
benefit communities.

   Justin Adams

   As they are currently written, the Paris Agreement pledges still fall
   short, likely keeping warming around 4°C. Every five years,
   international representatives and negotiators will meet to ramp up
   ambition, but the current timeline for countries to end their reliance
   on fossil fuels while still maintaining development and economic growth
   does not align with what is needed to achieve climate stability.
   Barring a technological miracle, the world likely needs more time than
   it realistically has to move to full economic decarbonization.

   “There’s a growing recognition that to get to below 2°C, we need to
   actively drawdown carbon from the atmosphere,” Adams says. “And while
   there’s lots of interest and investment in new technology solutions to
   capture and store carbon, this is new, experimental technology. Trees
   and other plants, meanwhile have already perfected this process over
   hundreds of millions of years of evolution—we’re unlikely to see a
   better carbon capture and storage technology than that which nature
   provides.”

   This makes the findings from the 20 pathways particularly important:
   they provide a scalable near-term option that, combined with fossil
   fuel emission reductions, can put the planet on a 2° path by 2030. If
   world leaders hold off on concurrently investing in nature now,
   emerging technology will have to play an exponentially larger role in
   reducing emissions later on. “That’s a gamble on the future that can be
   prevented today,” Adams says.

   “The rapid deployment of clean energy technologies currently being
   witnessed is truly inspiring, and we absolutely must press forward with
   the deployment of renewables, electric cars, energy efficiency and
   other methods for fossil fuel reduction,” Adams adds. “But we also need
   to see a similar level of investment in natural solutions, which are
   available now, are cost effective and greatly benefit communities.”

   Investing Where It Counts

   To understand some of the challenges to implementing natural climate
   solutions, consider the case of Indonesia. The country holds the
   world’s third largest tropical rainforest, but it has also experienced
   some of the fastest forest loss in tropical countries, primarily due to
   increased palm oil and forestry activities. The destruction of tropical
   forest ecosystems accounts for almost 50 percent of Indonesia's
   emissions, contributing to Indonesia’s position as the world’s tenth
   top emitter of greenhouse gasses.

   At the same time, “development is a required process for Indonesia,”
   says Wahjudi Wardojo, The Nature Conservancy’s senior advisor for
   terrestrial policy in Indonesia. Any conservation efforts in Indonesia
   need to balance economic growth with sustainable development.

   Wardojo is not alone in this situation—change agents working across
   widely different constituencies, ecosystems and governments face
   similar obstacles in implementing natural climate solutions. To
   convince land managers in both the public and private sector, they need
   more and better economic data that communicates the financial
   opportunities in deploying natural climate solutions.

   It’s this universal need for strong science and economic data that
   Adams, Griscom and the study’s co-authors hope to support. The research
   and findings in “Natural Climate Solutions” can be used as a starting
   point to guide cost-effective implementation of the 20 natural pathways
   around the world.

   Land-based climate solutions appear in more than 75 percent of
   individual country commitments to the Paris Agreement, yet renewable
   energy, energy efficiency and clean transport together receive nearly
   30 times the amount of public mitigation investment that land-based
   solutions receive. Of the funding that is set aside for natural climate
   solutions, the vast majority tends to focus on tropical forest
   protection in developing countries.

   Globally, forest pathways offer about half of the lowest-cost climate
   opportunities, while grassland and agriculture pathways account for a
   quarter, and wetlands nearly a fifth. But depending on a country’s
   geography and economy, any of these pathways could be significant for
   reducing emissions.

   “The important thing is for people to realize that this isn’t pie in
   the sky. Natural climate solutions are real techniques that have
   climate value,” says Bill Schlesinger, former president of the Cary
   Institute of Ecosystem Studies. “The guts of the paper are the economic
   graphs which tell us under different economic scenarios what is
   realistically possible.”

Biodiversity loss in the wetlands and rainforests, nutrient-rich soil issues
for farmers, indigenous people’s forest rights ... it’s all connected.

   Bronson Griscom


   A United Path Toward Climate Stability

   Building the coalitions needed to implement these solutions, even the
   most cost-effective ones, is easier said than done, especially if we’re
   to take action in the next decade. But one striking aspect of this new
   study is its demonstration that sectors often viewed as part of the
   problem—in particular forestry and agriculture—have a huge opportunity
   to step up and work as partners to transform working lands from carbon
   emitters to carbon sinks.

   Restoration could store the equivalent of 200 million tons of carbon
   dioxide equivalent each year. © Peter Mous/TNC
   × Cardinal fish in mangroves of Komodo National Park in Indonesia.

   Around the world and in a variety of ecosystems, efforts such as these
   are already seeing wide-scale success. In Indonesia, for example,
   advances in reduced-impact logging techniques are helping to mitigate
   carbon emissions even as the timber industry continues to support
   economic growth. From farmers in Northern Africa fighting
   desertification by planting trees to New Guinean fishing communities
   planting mangroves to attract fish and store carbon, there are
   thousands more on-the-ground projects setting the foundation for what
   is possible.

   If actions are taken now, nature can be an ally for sustainable
   development, economic growth and a low-carbon future—a future, as Adams
   puts it, where people and nature can thrive together.

Case Studies

   NCS in Action
   View

   This symbiotic approach to conservation and climate work is
   increasingly resonating with international leaders and unexpected
   partners in the climate community. And while the world is still a long
   way from the level of private sector investment and government action
   needed for natural climate solutions to reach transformational scale,
   there’s an air of excitement surrounding those who work in this space.

   “It’s incredible that to solve this relatively new problem—that seems
   bigger and uglier than anything we’ve ever tackled—we can also help
   solve other environmental challenges,” Bronson says. “Biodiversity loss
   in the wetlands and rainforests, nutrient-rich soil issues for farmers,
   issues surrounding indigenous people’s forest rights, and so on. Cue
   the 'Lion King' song—it’s all connected.”

   Griscom’s positivity is contagious, but current climate projections
   provide a sobering reminder that even committed global climate actions
   are not yet enough to avoid the catastrophic effects of a warming
   planet. If the world does not keep global temperatures from rising
   above 2°C, the World Bank warns of “extreme heat-waves, declining
   global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and
   life-threatening sea level rise," the effects of which will hit hardest
   in the world’s poorest regions, as is already being seen.

   We can not hit the 2°C or below target through reforms in the energy,
   industrial and transportation sectors alone, Griscom says—preventing
   further loss of nature and investing in natural climate solutions are
   essential to climate stability. The good news is these opportunities
   are both abundant and come a broad array of other benefits. This is
   climate’s make or break moment, and, as Griscom puts it, “nature is the
   sleeping giant.”
