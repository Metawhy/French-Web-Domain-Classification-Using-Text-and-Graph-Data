Tracking Corporate Commitments to Deforestation-free Supply Chains, 2017


    By Stephen Donofrio, Jonathan Leonard, Philip Rothrock

   View Publication

   Supply Change draws from already available data to track companies,
   their commitments, and their progress towards these commitments over
   time to support stakeholders’ decision-making and, ultimately, to drive
   transformational change. In addition to providing an update on the
   state of corporate commitments as companies continue to establish and
   pursue their pledges to deforestation-free supply chains, this report
   features the first year-on-year comparison of commitments compiled
   by Supply Change. It explores key business trends and developments,
   investigates the extent to which companies report progress and also the
   extent to which commitments are “dormant,” highlights which supporting
   organizations and initiatives have helped companies along the way, and
   compares companies with commitments compare to companies without
   commitments.
