Overview

   Tyrex is a research project team, affiliated with CNRS LIG, Inria, UGA,
   and Grenoble INP.

   We work on the foundations of the next generation of data analytics and
   data-centric programming systems. These systems extend ideas from
   programming languages, artificial intelligence, data management
   systems, and theory. Data-intensive applications are increasingly more
   demanding in sophisticated algorithms to represent, store, query,
   process, analyse and interpret data. We build and study data-centric
   programming methods and systems at the core of artificial intelligence
   applications. Challenges include the robust and efficient processing of
   large amounts of structured, heterogeneous, and distributed data.

   On the data-intensive application side, our current focus is on
   building efficient and scalable analytics systems. Our technical
   contributions particularly focus on the optimization, compilation, and
   synthesis of information extraction and analytics code, in particular
   with large amounts of data.

   On the theoretical side, we develop the foundations of data-centric
   systems and analytics engines with a particular focus on the analysis
   and typing of data manipulations. We focus in particular on the
   foundations of programming with distributed data collections. We also
   study the algebraic and logical foundations of query languages, for
   their analysis and their evaluation.
