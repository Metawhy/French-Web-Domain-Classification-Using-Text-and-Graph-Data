Beauty Warriors

   May, 9, 2017Posted in Blog, photography


   The series “Beauty Warriors” is a collection of photographs featuring
   strange and unusual-looking beauty products. All the products were
   bought on popular shopping sites, and most items were made from plastic
   and are cheap. These products promise instant cures to almost all
   beauty problems; they fight “problem zones” and promise to cure
   problems without surgical intervention.

   Each photograph is carefully planned and prepared, the clothing was
   found in the charity shops.

   During the sessions, we discussed beauty routines and secrets and of
   course, we had so much fun with trying out the beauty gadgets.

   To be successful, you must be perfect and look perfect—these are our
   society’s rules, which we all follow without even realizing how
   ridiculous the standards are. We often forget about the importance of
   inner beauty.

   The project is ongoing, as I just can’t stop buying these wonderful
   pieces!

   I am very lucky for having such lovely models who allowed to take
   pictures of them! Thank you so much!

   The project received LensCulture Portrait 2017 award and was nominated
   for Henry Nannen 2019 Award in Germany.

Now you can support the project here Crowdfunder.co.uk

   Ebay purchase history.
