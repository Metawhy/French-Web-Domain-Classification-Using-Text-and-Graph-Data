What

   The Cozinha do Vapor (Steam Kitchen!) was conceived by Jessica
   Bergstein-Collay and Mattia Paco Rizzi. Starting from an essential
   element for the working of Casa do Vapor – The Kitchen – they imparted
   in it both material and intangible dimensions.
   They took part in the construction of the kitchen and completed it by
   building a wood fire oven. Moreover, they created a local network
   against waste by establishing a partnership with some local retailers
   at Caparica (The Local Market and the Novo Rumo Supermarket) to do a
   weekly collection of wasted food.
   The food collected is used to cook community meals at Cozinha do Vapor
   that became a new meeting spot where people gather to share stories,
   recipes and cooking skills, while the fresh fish sizzles on the
   barbecue.

Who

When
