   Inria research team (équipe-projet), in partnership with LRI-HCC (CNRS
   & Université Paris-Sud).

   Keywords: Human-Computer Interaction; Interaction techniques for large
   datasets; Web of Data; Wall displays; Gesture-based interaction;
   Multi-user interaction.

   In an increasing number of domains, computer users are faced with large
   datasets, that are often interlinked and organized according to
   elaborate structures thanks to new data models such as those that are
   arising with the development of, e.g., the Web of Data. Rather than
   seeing the inherent complexity of those data models as a hindrance, we
   aim at leveraging it to design new interactive systems that can better
   assist users in their data understanding and processing tasks.

   These Data-centric Interactive Systems aim at providing users with the
   right information at the right time, presenting it in the most
   meaningful manner, and letting users efficiently manipulate, edit and
   share these data with others. This entails minimizing the effort
   required to retrieve and relate data from relevant sources; displaying
   data using presentation techniques that match the data's
   characteristics and the users' tasks; and providing users with means of
   interacting with the data that effectively support their train of
   thought.
