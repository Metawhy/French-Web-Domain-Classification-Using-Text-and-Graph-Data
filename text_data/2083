   ATTENTION ALL DIGITAL ARTISTS

There is a website called Humble Bundle. Right now, Corel Painter, normally a
multi-hundred dollar program, is on sale for 25$. It comes in a bundle, so it
comes with multiple other things, brushes, and other programs that compliment
Painter. The money goes to charity, and it seems like you can choose how much
of it goes there!

Idk what else to say, I'm just like,,,, excited and wanting to share the
hype. Btw, here's the link so you can see for yourself.

   We have Sam’s insulin for the next month, but I’ve still got to pay my
   phone bill, buy food and start paying off the $650 I owe my doctor so I
   can get back on my meds so I can find a new job. I literally can’t do
   this, Sam barely makes enough to keep the rent paid, let alone
   everything else by themselves.

   I’m sorry I keep asking for help, I just really don’t know what I’m
   going to do, the accident kinda plunged my life into a real bad spiral.

Choosing Fonts for Your Manga or Webcomic (Part 1)

   [avatar_958d4ceded95_64.pnj]
   karmiya

   Fonts are one of those funny things. A lot of people never even notice
   them- unless they’re bad. They’re one of those silent glues holding a
   work of fiction together, noticeable only ever by their failings.

   The world of fonts is really confusing, and it took me ages to get my
   bearings and figure out how I wanted to go forward with typesetting my
   manga. So I wanted to give other artists a bit of a leg up by sharing
   some of what I’ve learnt. I’m going to focus primarily on font choices
   for manga here, but this information should hopefully be applicable to
   any type of comic!

   Fonts in Manga

   Starting with manga! At some point, when deciding what type of font to
   use in English translated manga, one type won out. I don’t know why,
   because I think it’s pretty ill-suited to most manga, but it’s
   basically the same type of font you see in a lot of Western comic books
   and newspaper comic strips. It looks like this:
   image

   I personally don’t think these fonts are that suited to a lot of manga.
    It works great for shounen- you want reading to be as easy and quick
   as possible so that you aren’t distracted from fast-paced fight scenes.
   But it’s not well-suited to shoujo, or to more introspective manga
   aimed at adult readers, either. It’s become a lazy choice for manga
   typsetting, the easy default regardless of whether it suits a series or
   not. They get the job done and they’re wonderful fonts, don’t get me
   wrong. But I don’t think they add anything to the manga they’re used in
   a lot of the time, and my personal opinion is that your font choices
   should do just that.

   Back in the 90s Tokyopop did try a few different options. Cardcaptor
   Sakura and Magic Knight Rayearth both used Times New Roman (yes,
   seriously, they were that cheap) in its original run. Not the most
   exciting choice, perhaps, but on the other hand it does lend a nice
   novel-like feel to the typesetting.
   image

   The one where I really think they hit gold was Sailor Moon. (Yes, I
   know, what a shock, I love something about SM). The font they used for
   it probably ALSO came for free on their programmes back then (it’s
   called Formal 436 and can still be bought today), but its delicate
   curves were particularly well-suited to a shoujo manga with fantasy and
   magical girl themes.
   image

   The other main font they used was…wait, it has a ton of names. Cascade,
   Cassia, Formal 471… This leads into a different discussion about what a
   nightmare font licensing is, so let’s leave that alone for now! Anyway,
   it’s an absolutely beautiful font with elements of brush painting,
   woodcut, and calligraphy. It’s very, very uniquely suited to a shoujo
   series.
   image

   All in all, these font choices were great for a feminine series with
   fantasy and scifi elements. It seems like Tokyopop really pulled out
   all the stops for their flagship license, and it shows. These pages are
   really dynamic and fun to read, and I think the fonts definitely
   contribute to it.

   In Japanese manga, switching between different Japanese scripts can
   lend a lot of flavour to the text.
   image

   At the top is a hand-drawn word with a bubbly appearance. Then Mina
   says ‘ii otoko’ in katakana just to make it stand out from the rest of
   the text. The ‘V’ in Sailor V is written in English, which stands out
   better than only spelling out the Japanese pronunciation of ‘bui’. Then
   ‘The End’ is written in English. So it all stands out!

   English doesn’t have multiple alphabets (thank goodness!). So we can
   instead create this effect by mixing up our font choices. More on that
   later!

   Lettering in Western Comics

   This is not a subject which I’m particularly familiar with, I’ll admit
   right away. But I still thought it was important to touch on it. A lot
   of Western comics actually don’t use fonts- they’re hand lettered! In
   general a lot of Western comics published in the more traditional model
   are collaborative efforts. You’ll see separate credits for writers,
   pencils, inks, colours, lettering… A different person handles each
   task.

   I’m only familiar with a couple of hand-lettered comics, including Bee
   and Puppycat and Fionna and Cake, which have really adorable lettering
   which combines elements of a cute girly handwritten appearance with a
   more script like appearance. And without the limitations of a digital
   font, all sorts of creative things can be done with them. The font can
   basically just go anywhere you want it to.
   image image

   You can see that in some cases the speech bubble is curved, and the
   letters curve with it! Doing that sort of thing with a digital font is
   an absolute nightmare, and much easier with hand-lettering. And it
   looks so cute and dynamic on the page!

   And of course, the standard font used in English translated manga today
   is based on the lettering styles used in both newspaper comic strips
   and superhero comics.
   image

   Its primary purpose is to be easy to read- very useful in particular
   for newspaper strips which were printed in small sizes and on cheap
   paper.

   Creatively, hand-lettering offers you a lot of freedom and the ability
   to make some really artistic choices. But it’s also not very practical
   for single artists. It’s a totally different skill to drawing- I’m sure
   I’m not the only artist out there who has ‘doctor’s handwriting’ and
   couldn’t letter a comic to save her life! And not only do I not have
   the resources to hire someone to letter my manga for me- I don’t want
   to. I like making every page 100% by myself and having full creative
   control. So whether this approach works for you may depend both on your
   skills (if you’re already into, say, calligraphy, you might be able to
   letter your comic yourself!) and your preferences regarding
   collaborative work.

   -

   This is some of the stuff to keep in mind stylistically, but before we
   continue with adding fonts to comics, there’s a lot of fuss to go
   through when actually finding fonts which you can safely use! Font
   licensing is a total mess, to be frank. I’ll be going over that in part
   two, along with covering the main types of fonts out there and where to
   find fonts to use in your comics!

   Please join me then! If you want to make sure you see when I post it,
   please consider following me!

   Part Two (coming soon!)
