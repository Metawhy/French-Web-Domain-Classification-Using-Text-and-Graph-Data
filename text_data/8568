Welcome to The California Wine Club

   Since 1990, it's been our wine club's mission to help artisan wineries
   share their small-batch wines with wine enthusiasts everywhere. At The
   California Wine Club we happen to think these wines simply taste better
   than the mass-produced wines that dominate store shelves.

   We visit the wineries, meet the families and winemakers behind the
   wines and then invite them to share their favorite wines with our wine
   club members.  Every wine featured in our five monthly wine clubs comes
   from a real-working winery and is proudly backed by our wine club's
   Love It Guarantee.

   If quality and service matter to you, and you've been searching for a
   wine of the month club to try out, we invite you to give us a try and
   get to know the artisan wineries we feature.

   We also have gift options for all of our wine club levels. Our wine
   club gifts are perfect for all kinds of special occasions: weddings,
   holidays, birthdays, and corporate gifts for clients.

   Cheers and thank you for supporting our small family business!

The Most Loved Wine Club!
