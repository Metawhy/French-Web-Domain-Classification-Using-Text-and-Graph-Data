Privacy Notice

TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY POLICY

   With this privacy policy we, PubNative GmbH, Greifswalder Str. 212,
   10405 Berlin (hereinafter „PubNative“ or “we”) would like to inform you
   about the processing of personal data when using our mobile advertising
   optimization technology (“PubNative`s Technology”). PubNative’s
   Technology is integrated into mobile apps to provide personalized ad
   experiences. The providers of the respective apps (“Publishers”) are
   responsible for the integration in the first place. Please therefore
   also note their individual privacy policies.

   To access the privacy policy governing our Website, please click here.
    1. Provider of PubNative’s Technology

   PubNative’s Technology is provided by

   PubNative GmbH

   Greifswalder Str. 212

   10405 Berlin.

   Should you have any questions or suggestions regarding data protection,
   please do not hesitate to contact us. You are welcome to direct your
   data protection concerns to our data protection officer by sending an
   email to datenschutz@PubNative.net. Our full contact details are
   available here.
    2. Personal Data processing in connection with PubNative’s Technology

   2.1 Data we receive.

   First of all, we do not know who you (as a user) are. PubNative neither
   processes the names nor the addresses or e-mail addresses or similar
   information of users. That said, we only process data provided by the
   Publishers, including user information about the interaction with apps,
   which is recorded, stored and evaluated using temporary identifiers,
   which PubNative is unable to decode (so-called pseudonyms). The
   Publishers determine the purposes and means on how we process users’
   data. We have established several technical and legal measures to
   safeguard that the Publisher’s users have given their consent for our
   processing.

   Data we receive from Publishers differ. We typically receive:
     * mobile identifiers such as the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA),
       Google Advertising ID
     * device information (device model, platform, operating system
       version, browser details).

   However, from time to time the Publishers may also provide data to us,
   which typically relates to the behavior of users inside the Publisher’s
   apps and may include:
     * user interactions within an app (e.g. in-app purchases,
       registration)
     * user information such as age, gender, interests.

   2.2  Purposes of data processing.

   We process the data received from Publishers on behalf of the
   Publishers so that they can market ad space for targeted in-app
   advertising and targeting campaigns. When serving personalized mobile
   advertising, this gives advertisers the opportunity to target users who
   are actually interested in their products, offers and content.

   Our processing activities include the following:
     * Serving ads to the users
     * Serving ads to the users taking into account their approximate
       location when permitted by the user’s device
     * Serving ads to the users taking into account their age, gender,
       keywords or interests when provided by the user in the host mobile
       app on the user’s device. Race, religion, politics, sex life, or
       health are unavailable targeting criterions in PubNative’s
       Technology
     * Aggregating reports for publishers, advertisers and internal
       systems on how many ad requests PubNative received, how many ads
       were displayed and clicked
     * Limiting and control number of ads same users see
     * Limiting and control number of ads of particular campaign users see
     * Detecting fraud by running models to identify invalid events
       (requests, impressions, clicks)
     * Analyzing internally aggregated reports in order to improve
       PubNative product offerings.

   We are unable to combine the data we receive in a way that would enable
   us to personally identify users and we do not combine the data with any
   third-party data that would enable us to do so.

   2.3  Data recipients.

   PubNative only discloses data to other parties if this is necessary for
   the implementation of campaigns or other purposes listed in this
   privacy notice, or if another legal basis for the disclosure of data
   exists. The collection and processing of usage data by the mobile app
   Publishers are controlled by and the exclusive responsibility of the
   respective Publishers. PubNative processes these data for and on behalf
   of the Publishers in the first place.

   In the context of the serving of ads, data are exchanged between
   PubNative and partner advertisers on the bid request level (to get an
   ad) or in aggregated form for reporting and fraud analysis. This might
   include the following information on the bid request level:
     * device information (device model, platform, operating system
       version, browser details)
     * targeting information (county, city, hyperlocation when allowed to
       be collected)
     * user information (such as device ID, hashed device ID, age, gender
       and interests, when allowed to be collected).

   If PubNative uses its own external service providers (e.g. data
   centers), the service providers may only use the data to fulfill their
   task. All service providers have been carefully selected and
   commissioned. They are bound by the instructions of PubNative and are
   regularly checked. In cases where data is processed in countries
   outside the European Union, appropriate safeguards are always in place
   to protect data subjects.

   2.4  Retention period.

   The collected data are stored for as long as the usage data and data
   about interactions with ads and installations of new apps are required
   for the described purposes. After that, the data are deleted or
   completely anonymized. We will further delete personal data immediately
   when the Publisher informs us that the user has withdrawn consent. We
   will, however, retain and use information as long as necessary to
   comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
   agreements.

   2.5  Basis for the processing.

   The data processing described in this privacy policy serves to market
   ad space for targeted in-app advertising and targeting campaigns and
   implement ad campaigns for the customers of PubNative. As such, data
   are only processed on the basis of users’ consent as part of customer
   instructions. Insofar as data from PubNative are processed for purposes
   of billing, abuse monitoring or fraud prevention, error correction and
   for optimizing PubNative’s Technology, this is done on the basis of
   PubNative’s legitimate interests. The legal basis in this respect is
   Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The interests of users are protected by the
   exclusively pseudonymous processing and the opt-out option described
   below.
    3. Users’ rights

   Users have the right to access information about the processing of
   their personal data by PubNative. In this regard, PubNative will
   explain the data processing to you as the user and provide you with an
   overview of the data stored about you. However, since PubNative
   processes data on behalf of customers (Publishers), users should
   contact the relevant Publisher directly. Whenever needed and upon
   request, we will assist the Publisher. If data stored by PubNative is
   incorrect or no longer up to date, you have the right to have this data
   corrected. You may also demand that your data be erased. Should the
   erasure not be possible in exceptional cases due to other legal
   regulations, the data will be blocked so that it is only available for
   that legal purpose. You may also have the processing of your personal
   data restricted, if for example, you have doubts as to the accuracy of
   the data. You also have the right to data portability, which means that
   on request PubNative will send you a digital copy of the personal data
   you have provided. You also have the right to object to data
   processing, insofar as this is based on legitimate interests pursuant
   to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. In particular, you can object to the processing
   of your data for advertising purposes at any time. The opt-out function
   described below can be used for this purpose at any time. You also have
   the right to complain to the data protection supervisory authority
   responsible for PubNative (Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and
   Freedom of Information, Friedrichstr. 219, 10969 Berlin) or to your
   competent authority. You are also free to contact your local data
   protection authority, which will then forward your request to the
   competent authority.
    4. Opt-out

   If you no longer wish to receive targeted in-app advertising that is
   deployed based on PubNative’s Technology, you may do so through the
   device-level advertising preference setting available in the settings
   menus of your iOS and/or Android devices.

   Android Users (version 2.3 and above)

   To use the “opt-out of interest-based advertising” option, follow the
   instructions provided by Google here: Google Play Help.

   iOS users (version 6 and above)

   To use the “Limit Ad-Tracking” option, follow the instructions provided
   by Apple here: Apple Support Center

   Please note that these are device settings and will disable
   interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for us. We have
   decided to offer this way of opting-out, as we estimate users will
   either want to receive interest-based advertising or no interest-based
   advertising at all. The above-described way is most efficient to
   achieve that goal.

   You may also request deleting your data or opt-out of targeted in-app
   advertising via e-mail to support@pubnative.net.
    5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

   We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any
   time in accordance with the currently applicable data protection
   regulations. This website always contains the latest version of the
   Technology Privacy Policy

   Updated: July 2018
