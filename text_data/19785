     * Happy October, people! I’ve been amazed at how many of you have
       tried and loved this Vanilla Chai Cake recipe already 😱🙌🏽 makes my
       day every time! The flavor for this beauty comes from a homemade
       chai spice mix (cinnamon, allspice, ginger, cardamom, cloves) +
       steeping a chai tea bag in the whole milk before adding it at the
       end ☕️✨I topped it with some crushed @traderjoes Speculoos cookies
       to take it a step beyond 🙌🏽 it’s the perfect cake for this cozy
       Fall weather 🍂🍁 click the link in my bio for the full recipe +
       decorating tips!
     * Another favorite tea cake recipe: this matcha layer cake with
       raspberry buttercream filling + a vanilla-matcha buttercream ombré
       finish 🍵 🙌🏽 made for my friends at @teabar last year with their
       amazing organic Culinary Matcha (the best ever)✨this cake is so
       tasty, aromatic, and perfect for any green tea lover 💕 I love the
       color and flavor of this matcha powder so much that I mixed some of
       it into melted white chocolate to make those geometric shapes on
       top! 🍵🥳 click the link in my bio for the full recipe (even includes
       a tutorial for the white chocolate geometric shapes) 👏🏽
     * I’ve been wanting to make a Chai Cake recipe for what seems like
       forever and I finally did it, y’all 🙌🏽😍 layers of fluffy, moist
       Vanilla Chai Cake that’s infused with chai tea + spiced with a
       homemade Chai Spice Mix (cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves,
       allspice) ✨☕️ I added some of the Chai Spice Mix to the vanilla
       buttercream and oh my!👏🏽 it tastes like an Autumnal dreamscape and
       I’m obsessed with the little flecks of spices in the buttercream
       (zoom to see 😍). Click the link in my bio for the full recipe +
       decorating tips 🍁🍂✨and PS that cute mug in the background was made
       by my friend @margaretandbeau who just opened up the cutest
       ceramics/art shop in Portland (@cupboardgoods)! If you’re local, go
       have a look 😍
     * The cozy color palette on this shag cake is fully inspired by
       Autumn 🍁 I used @americolor Maroon, Dusty Rose, Terracotta, and
       Wedgewood for these shades, all piped with @wiltoncakes tip 233
       👩🏽‍🎨🎨 the texture is unreal! You’ll find the full tutorial by
       heading to @thecakeblog or clicking the link in my bio 🎉
     * Happy (official!) first day of Fall🍁🍂so thrilled for this cozy
       season and I’m excited to share some NEW Autumnal recipes starting
       this week 🙌🏽 in the meantime, this beautiful Salted Caramel Apple
       Cake recipe is linked in my bio + is one of my all-time Fall faves:
       layers of apple spice cake and salted caramel buttercream, topped
       with a dripping salted caramel apple 🍎🤩 it’s SO tasty and will make
       your kitchen smell amaaazing 🎉
     * Created this Autumn-inspired shag cake for @thecakeblog and I’m
       swooning over the colors and texture🍁😍 I had the strongest urge to
       run my hands through that shaggy buttercream when it was all
       finished 😂 this technique is so easy and works in endless color
       schemes 🙌🏽✨ click the link in my bio for the full tutorial!
