About

   Slideshow of founders and startups at Y Combinator.

Y Combinator created a new model for funding early stage startups.

   Twice a year we invest a small amount of money ($150k) in a large
   number of startups.

   The startups move to Silicon Valley for 3 months, during which we work
   intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape
   and refine their pitch to investors. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day,
   when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected,
   invite-only audience.

   But YC doesn't end on Demo Day. We and the YC alumni network continue
   to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond.

   Marc Andreessen

     "Y Combinator is the best program for creating top-end entrepreneurs
     that has ever existed."
     Marc Andreessen, General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz

   Patrick Collison

     "I doubt that Stripe would have worked without YC. It's that simple.
     Acquiring early customers, figuring out who to hire, closing deals
     with banks, raising money -- YC's partners were closely involved and
     crucially helpful."
     Patrick Collison, Founder, Stripe (YC S09)

   Julia Hartz

     "I've been fortunate to engage with the YC community at past events
     over the last few years, and always walk away impressed with the
     passion and caliber of talent that YC brings together."
     Julia Hartz, Co-Founder & CEO, Eventbrite
