AGROFORESTRY AND REFORESTATION

FORESTS, AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE


   STATE OF THE FOREST

   Halting deforestation is a global challenge largely due to
   unsustainable agricultural practices that degrade natural ecosystems.

   Since the beginning of the 20th century, the world’s forests lost about
   20% of their coverage. Ninety percent of deforestation is the result of
   agriculture, with 60% due to the extension of agro-industrial intensive
   farming (soya, palm oil, corn…), and the remaining 30% caused by
   small-scale and subsistence farmers. Close to 20% of all carbon
   emissions result from deforestation and forest degradation.

   Climate change will increasingly affect agricultural conditions and
   there is an urgent need to make farming practices evolve to adapt to
   climate change. In 2007, experts at the FAO (Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations) stated that agro-ecology was the
   most reliable way to guarantee food security in our future. They based
   their findings on tangible data, collected in developing countries
   where industrial agronomy has already showed signs of reaching its
   limits with: catastrophic erosion, increased climatic instability,
   desertification.

AGROFORESTRY: THE ART OF INTEGRATION

   Agroforestry is the smart integration of trees into farming systems.
   Unlike full-sun fields, vulnerable and contributing to ecosystems
   degradation, agrofrestry is a way to preserve productive ecosystems and
   adapt to climate change. The trees provide multiple services for
   improved quality and long-term sustainability of the production.

   Different agroforestry models with trees integrated in the perimeter of
   fields, intercropped, or at landscape level will deliver a mix a
   various ecosystem services for the farmers.

CARBON FORESTRY PROJECTS

   carbon_projects carbon_projects

   We envision carbon projects as a way to foster socio-economic
   development while enhancing and preserving the environment. This is the
   spirit of the Kyoto protocol. It is important to keep it in mind the
   development aspect of the carbon market. It is a key component and
   fundamental criteria. While the carbon market is often perceived as
   simply a financial market, or perceived at best only as an
   environmental initiative to fight climate change, it is actually a way
   to fight climate change by bringing additional funds from rich
   countries (listed in the “appendix 1” of the UN) to poorer countries
   (in appendix 2 of the UN).

   Forestry projects are fully in line with this vision of solidarity
   especially in how PUR Projet operates. Reforestation projects help
   small and disadvantaged populations to plant trees and reforest their
   parcels where they previously could not afford it, or did not have the
   capacity to implement. They benefit in terms of natural resources
   preservation, soil enrichment, increased and diversified incomes.

MULTIPLE BENEFITS FROM AGROFORESTRY

   Land conservation with agroforestry is a powerful tool to restore
   degraded ecosystems and improve farmers’ livelihood. Together with
   trees, multifunctional agroforestry systems acting as natural
   ecosystems allow a progressive self-enrichment of the system. It is
   well adapted to small areas and local farmers.

   The System of Rice Internsification (SRI) has received the Olam Prize
   for Innovation in Food Security at the 3rd Global Science Conference on
   Climate Smart Agriculture in Montpellier, France. Using climate-smart
   methodology, the SRI is a game-changer. This low impact micro-farming
   enables the increase of yields by 20-50% whilst reducing farmers’
   costs. Knowing that the livelihood of over a billion people depends
   upon rice production, this practice of agroecology is an outstanding
   innovation that we experiment with farmers in Thailand

RICE DUCKING


   Rice ducking is a system of rice production invented by a Japanese
   farmer: Takao Furuno. By releasing ducks into rice paddies, Furuno has
   achieved a higher rice yield with much less labor and financial outlay,
   while at the same time maintaining environmentally sustainable
   agriculture. Advantages are that the ducks eat weeds (which means weeds
   do not need to be removed by hand), they also eat insects, the ducks'
   droppings provide nourishment for the growing rice. and the ducks,
   while moving among the plants, are constantly paddling the water and
   thus prevent too much settling, such as sediments, at the bottom of the
   paddies. The ducks also eat golden snails, which are a serious threat
   to rice. And the final advantage is that ducks provide an acceptable
   level of stress so that the plants can grow stronger and healthier. For
   ducks, rice paddies are excellent environments because they provide
   both water and food as well as a hiding place from predators. And
   finally, people will eat the ducks as a complementary source of
   protein.

   PUR Projet has been implementing this experiment since 2014 as part of
   Dhamma Raksa project with the support of Louis Dreyfus Foundation.

   Permaculture aims at creating systems that are ecologically-sound and
   economically viable, which provide for their own needs, do not exploit
   or pollute, and are therefore sustainable in the long term.
   Permaculture uses the inherent qualities of plants and animals combined
   with the natural characteristics of landscapes and structures to
   produce a life-supporting system for city and country, using the
   smallest practical area.

   The term permaculture was first coined by Australians David Holmgren,
   then a graduate student, and his professor, Bill Mollison, in 1978. The
   word permaculture originally referred to "permanent agriculture",but
   was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was
   understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable
   system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka’s natural farming philosophy.

   PUR Projet supports the development of permaculture in all projects,
   and agroforestry is a common rule in permaculture. In France, PUR
   Projet participated in the launch of the Bourdaisière micro-farm on 1.3
   ha. The project is led by Maxime Rostolan, with the objective to create
   a sustainable human ecosystem, "recreating a habitat by observing and
   adjusting human or agricultural ecosystems." The experimentation on
   this test-plot is documented and shared to promote permaculture
   practices.
