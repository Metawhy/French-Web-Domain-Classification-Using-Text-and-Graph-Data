"Across many of our brands, we've started to rely on Klaviyo as one of the
most important tools to help us organize, understand, and take action on our
customer information in the most effective way."

   Connie Kim,

   Vice President, Strategy & New Business Development

20,000+

businesses of all sizes rely on Klaviyo to help them grow.

Listen, analyze, and act on your customer data

   Building relationships online is no different than in-person. You need
   to listen to customers, process and understand what they’re saying
   (directly and indirectly), and act on that insight—in real-time. Most
   software complicates and extends this process, never delivering what
   you really need. With Klaviyo, you can have an idea in the morning and
   deliver by the afternoon.
