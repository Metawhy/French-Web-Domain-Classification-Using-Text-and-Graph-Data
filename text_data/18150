CoqHoTT in a nutshell

   CoqHoTT stands for Coq for Homotopy Type Theory. The goal of this
   project is to go further in the correspondence between proofs and
   programs which has allowed in the last 20 years the development of
   useful proof assistants, such as Coq. Those assistants have shown their
   efficiency to prove correctness of important pieces of software but
   their democratization suffers from a major drawback, the mismatch
   between equality in mathematics and in type theory (which is the theory
   at the heart of Coq). Thus, significant Coq developments have only been
   done by virtuosos playing with advanced concepts of computer science
   and mathematics. Recently, an extension of type theory with homotopical
   concepts has been proposed by Fields medal Vladimir Voevodsky, which
   allows for the first time to get the right notion of equality in
   theorem provers. The main goal of the CoqHoTT project is to provide a
   new generation of proof assistants based on this fascinating connection
   between homotopy theory and type theory. The impact of the CoqHoTT
   project may be very strong as it will promote Coq as a major proof
   assistant, for both computer scientists and mathematicians, as it
   should become an essential tool for program certification and
   formalization of mathematics.

Research Topics

     * Define an internalization of Homotopy Type Theory in Coq.
       As witnessed by the outcome of a whole year of work of leading
       mathematicians and computer scientists of the field (during The
       Univalent Foundations Program at the Institute for Advanced Study
       in Princeton [1]), developing a direct complete treatment of
       homotopy type theory is a very complex task that is far from being
       accomplished. This is mainly because it raises a lot of coherence
       issues coming from the use of infinitely many dimensions. We are
       confident that defining an interpretation of homotopy type theory
       inside type theory is the key to successfully interpret it. The
       main challenge is to internalize the definition of the infinite
       structure involved in homotopy type theory. There are various
       recent current works on the subject on which we plan to base our
       investigations. The original model of Voevodsky is based on Kan
       simplicial sets but suffers from decidability issues (mainly due to
       degeneracy maps) which does not make it a good candidate for
       mechanization [2]. The infinite structure could be described using
       an operadic approach to ∞-groupoids. Indeed, although the usual
       enriched inductive construction of strict n-categories is known to
       be broken in the weak setting, Trimble [3] has recently proposed to
       use specific operads to parametrize the weakly associative
       composition in the higher-dimensional structures and recover an
       inductive definition of weak n-categories. Cheng and Leinster [4]
       have recently propose a co-inductive construction of weak
       ∞-categories based on Trimble’s approach and on the notion of
       terminal coalgebras. Another line of work, initiated by Coquand’s
       team, aims to look at more computational notion of ∞-groupoids, for
       instance by studying cubical sets [5]. Finally, Altenkirch has
       proposed to construct ∞-groupoids in a more syntactic way [6], by
       generating the structure without higher-dimensional coherences and
       getting back coherences using an “all diagrams commute” approach.
       It is not clear what is the best description to be used but this
       question is currently a highly discussed topic among homotopy type
       theorists.

     * Define and implement a general notion of higher inductive types.
       The goal here is to give a meaning to the newly introduced notion
       of higher inductive types (HIT). Those objects are at the heart of
       the formalization of homotopy theory inside a proof assistant.
       Giving them a computational meaning will allow mathematicians not
       only to formalize and prove theorems in homotopy theory, but also
       to use type theory to compute the homotopy groups of complex
       objects. Indeed, homotopy theorists now face a computational blow
       up in their work on the classification of topological spaces. This
       blow up is commonly believed to require the use of a computer to
       assist mathematicians. But the notion of HIT as also consequences
       in computer science as it provides a new type former that provides
       constructors together with (relevant) equalities. For instance,
       version control systems can be modeled with a HIT where committing
       and reverting correspond to applying equalities of this HIT [2].
       Even if HITs have already been introduced in [1,3], their complete
       and precise definition is the subject of ongoing research [4].
       Indeed, for the moment, existing HITs have been encoded using
       defined-by-hand axioms to represent elimination rules. This
       prevents HITs to be defined by non-expert users and also demands to
       check consistency for each HIT by finding a model in which it can
       be defined. This situation is clearly not satisfactory but is
       justified by the fact that developing a general theory for HITs is
       a very complex task. Using a compilation phase approach, new
       investigations of the theory will be directly testable by defining
       a translation into traditional type theory. We believe that this
       approach will help converging to a satisfactory definition more
       quickly.

     * Extend homotopy type theory with new logical/computational
       principles.
       The goal here is to reuse well-known model transformations [3] to
       enhance HoTT with new logical principles. The challenge is to give
       a meaning, through separate compilation phases, to axioms often
       used in mathematics, such as the law of excluded middle or the
       axiom of dependent choice. As adding new logical principles may
       have a computational cost and may weaken the extraction mechanism,
       our plan is to extend HoTT modularly, letting the user choose with
       which extension to work. Thus, this challenge consists in achieving
       a high level of modularity in the logical principle governing the
       type theory of the proof assistant. We have already proven [1] that
       the forcing transformation (which corresponds to the presheaf
       construction) enables to enhance the logic of Coq with new
       constructors such as general unrestricted inductive types (not to
       be confused with higher inductive types). We plan to apply this
       technique to other constructions that require the univalence axiom
       to be correct and in particular to the sheaf construction. This
       will allow for instance to implement in type theory the so-called
       Gödel translation from classical logic to intuitionistic logic,
       giving this way a computational meaning to the law of excluded
       middle. The structure underlying homotopy type theory is that of
       ∞-topos recently studied by Jacob Lurie [2]. The main theoretical
       challenge of this work package will be to make concrete the forcing
       transformation and the sheaf construction in the setting of
       ∞-topoi. Indeed, while pre-sheaves and sheaves have already been
       defined in this setting, the definitions are very abstract and a
       huge work need to be done to make them sufficiently effective to be
       implemented using the language of homotopy type theory. For
       instance, an effective construction of sheaves requires to
       reformulate sheaves for ∞-topoi using the notion of Lawvere-Tierney
       topology [3]. One of the main issue will be the definition of the
       associated sheaf functor in that setting.
