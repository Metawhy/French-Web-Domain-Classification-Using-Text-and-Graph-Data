The best mattress for back pain and more

   3/9/2018

   0 Commentaires

   Okay. So, there are a lot of ways that we can answer the question,
   “What is the best mattress for back pain?” but we will start with the
   most simple answer. And you may think that this answer is a cop-out,
   but be assured that it is the most important thing to remember if you
   are buying a mattress to help back pain. Here it is:
   The best mattress for back pain is the one that makes your back feel
   better
   Our sincerest apologies if this is not the answer you were looking for.
   Maybe we can explain.
   Mattress comforts vary so much that it is hard to pinpoint an exact
   mattress that will help with back pain. The reason that they vary is
   because we are all so different. Even if I had a person walk into the
   store that had the exact same build as me, and if we had similar back
   pains, we might not sleep the same. So we might not like the same
   mattress.
   Preference is the real key when you are in the market for a new
   mattress. That’s why we tell people to make sure to really try out the
   bed! Don’t be persuaded by cost. Both high costs and low costs. Just
   because it has a high price tag does not mean that it will be the best
   mattress for you. And if you are persuaded by a low cost, then it is
   likely that you are sacrificing your comfort for your wallet.
   Now that that is out of the way, let’s give you some general advice
   about mattresses will be best for back pain.
   Memory Foam
   When anyone comes into our store wondering which mattress will help
   most with their back pain we immediately walk over to the memory foam
   section. This is because memory foam mattresses are generally the best
   mattresses for people with back pains.
   Here are some reasons why:
   Memory foam mattresses conform to your body. Logically, a mattress that
   conforms to your body would be better than a mattress that your body
   has to conform to. This keeps your spine in its proper alignment,
   relieving back pain caused from poor alignment during sleep.

   Memory foam reduces stress on hips and shoulders.

   It also allows for better circulation throughout the body. Back, hip,
   shoulder, knee (or just any of your major pressure points) get cradled
   and protected by memory foam
   Any pain caused by poor alignment or too much pressure during sleep
   will subside by using memory foam mattresses.
   A little example for you. Just last year, I hurt my ankle playing
   basketball. Because of the pain and discomfort in my ankle, I wasn’t
   able to sleep in my normal position. When I woke up the first morning
   after hurting my ankle, I couldn’t tell which hurt more, my ankle or my
   back. Sleeping funny had thrown my back out of line. Memory foam
   mattresses relieve all kinds of pressure related pain in the body.
   We have even more information about memory foam and why we recommend
   it. You can see it, if you so wish. Other non-memory foam mattresses
   that are best for back pain
   Memory foam is best for back pains for the reasons explained above. But
   the truth is that memory foam is not for everyone. I do not know the
   full reasons why, but some people simply do not like the feel of memory
   foam. They don’t like the cradle/support feeling.
   So, if you fall into the I-do-not-love-memory-foam category then there
   are still options for you and your poor back.
   Here are the key principles, and then we can talk about the products.
   Support You need to have a mattress that provides you with the proper
   support. In most cases, this means that you need more of a firm
   mattress. This does not mean that it can’t have an element of softness,
   it just means that it needs to be supportive.

   With that said, we can tell you that the best foams are those with high
   resiliency. They need to push back on you to give you support. The best
   foam that we have found for this is latex foam. It is super supportive
   and last for a very long time without wearing down. The downside is
   that latex is more expensive than other foams.
   All foam mattresses are also something to consider when thinking about
   your back. After we have shown the customer the memory foam beds, and
   they don’t care for them, we walk them over to our all-foam mattress.
   It has 11 inches of high resiliency foam for the base (very supportive)
   and 3 inches of latex to top it off (supportive, long lasting, and
   comfortable).
