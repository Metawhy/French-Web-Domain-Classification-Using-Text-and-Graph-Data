   TECHSPEC® Off-Axis Parabolic (OAP) Mirrors with Alignment Through Holes
   are designed with two through holes, one that aligns with the focal
   point of beams focused off the parabolic surface and the second
   parallel to beams collimated by the surface. The hole placements allow
   for two beams to hit a target or sample simultaneously, which is a
   technique used to take pump-probe measurements. These OAPs feature
   aluminum substrates and are diamond turned with a surface roughness of
   <50Å RMS that minimizes scatter. TECHSPEC Off-Axis Parabolic Mirrors
   with Alignment Through Holes are available coated with protected gold,
   protected aluminum, or UV enhanced aluminum for integration into
   applications requiring high reflectance from the ultraviolet (UV) to
   the infrared (IR).

   Note: Please contact us for custom options if your application requires
   a standard OAP Mirror with a through hole.

Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors for Dispersion Compensation

   Watch to learn how the TECHSPEC® Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors
   from Edmund Optics® compensate for dispersion and compress pulse
   duration in ultrafast laser systems. Pulse compression is critical in
   ultrafast applications including medical lasers, micromachining, and
   nonlinear imaging. These mirrors enable shorter output pulses by
   compensating for group delay dispersion (GDD) as well as third- and
   higher-order dispersion. Highly-Dispersive Mirrors can be used instead
   of grating or prism pulse compressors to create more compact,
   alignment-insensitive systems. You can view the TECHSPEC®
   Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors at
   www.edmundoptics.com/highly-dispersive-mirrors and our full range of
   ultrafast optical components at
   https://www.edmundoptics.com/c/ultrafast-optics/1224/.

   (BUTTON) Video Transcript
   Hi, my name is Tony Karam and I am the Laser Optics Product Line
   Manager for Ultrafast Optics at Edmund Optics. Highly-Dispersive
   Ultrafast Mirrors are designed to be used with lasers that have pico-,
   femto-, or atto-second pulse durations. These types of lasers are
   called ultrafast Lasers. Because of their extreme pulse duration, these
   ultrafast lasers ablate tissues and other materials with higher
   precision than previously used technology, like nanosecond lasers. As
   such, ultrafast lasers are used in medical applications to make
   procedures like corrective eye surgery safer by reducing the risk of
   infection and reducing patient recovery time. Ultrafast lasers are also
   used for advanced material processing and to micromachine small
   features with higher accuracy and efficiency than other types of
   lasers. In addition to the biomedical and material processing
   industries, Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors are also used in a wide
   variety of other applications such as 3D printing of medical devices,
   nonlinear imaging, and spectroscopy. The broad energy bandwidth of
   ultrashort pulses is due to the uncertainty principle that arises from
   the inherent wave properties of photons, where the precision of
   time-energy is limited by the Fourier transform. As they travel,
   ultrafast pulses temporally distort. Hence, compression and
   dispersion-compensation are required when working with ultrafast
   lasers. Fortunately, Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors can correct
   this dispersion with mirror coatings that feature large negative group
   delay dispersions and low loss over large bandwidths. Large group delay
   dispersion is achieved by combining and optimizing the effects from two
   simpler mirror coating technologies known as chirped mirrors and
   Gires-Tournois Interferometer mirrors. Traditional chirped mirrors
   achieve negative group delay dispersion by using the
   wavelength-dependent relation to penetration depth. However, this
   technology introduces wavelength-dependent GDD oscillations as well,
   similar to Fabry-Perot resonators and is only able to achieve limited
   negative GDD. Gires-Tournois Interferometer mirrors achieve
   angle-dependent negative group delay dispersion based on resonant
   cavity structures. However, this technology is only usable for a very
   narrow bandwidth and introduces third and higher order dispersion.
   Optimizing these two technologies allows for coatings with larger group
   delay dispersion values to be achieved, with lower losses and over a
   broader bandwidth, than traditional chirped mirrors or GTI mirrors,
   without increasing the thickness of multilayer coatings. For more
   information on Highly-Dispersive Ultrafast Mirrors and the applications
   in which they are used, visit
   www.edmundoptics.com/highly-dispersive-mirrors.
