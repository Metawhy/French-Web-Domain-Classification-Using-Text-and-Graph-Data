Company Overview

   Lycos, Inc. is a survivor. Established in 1995, we were originally a
   search engine — before most people even knew what a "search engine"
   was. Times change, and Lycos, Inc. has changed with them, evolving from
   a single search engine into a focused network of community and social
   sites that include Tripod.com, Angelfire.com, and of course, Lycos.com.

   How has Lycos, Inc. managed to survive so many market changes while
   others have perished? The key to our longevity is diversity; we have
   integrated and fostered different brands, sources of revenue, and
   meaningful online communities for over 15 years.

   Bringing people together to interact, have fun, and experience the best
   the web has to offer is in our DNA. It's who we are, and it's something
   we're happy to offer now, and forever.
