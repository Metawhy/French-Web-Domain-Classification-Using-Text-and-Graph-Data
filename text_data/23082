Fact Sheet

   Gaia is an ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our
   Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process revealing the composition,
   formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Gaia will provide unprecedented
   positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed
   to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion
   stars in our Galaxy and throughout the Local Group. This amounts to
   about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population.

Gaia untangles the starry strings of the Milky Way

   28 August 2019

   Rather than leaving home young, as expected, stellar 'siblings' prefer
   to stick together in long-lasting, string-like groups, finds a new
   study of data from ESA's Gaia spacecraft.

Astronomers spy Europa blocking distant star – thanks to Gaia

   25 July 2019On 31 March 2017, Jupiter's moon Europa passed in front of
   a background star – a rare event that was captured for the first time
   by ground-based telescopes thanks to data provided by ESA's Gaia
   spacecraft.

Gaia starts mapping our galaxy’s bar

   16 July 2019The first direct measurement of the bar-shaped collection
   of stars at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy has been made by
   combining data from ESA’s Gaia mission with complementary observations
   from ground- and space-based telescopes.

Gaia's biggest operation since launch

   15 July 2019On Tuesday 16 July, teams at ESA's mission control will
   perform an 'orbit change manoeuvre' on the Gaia space observatory – the
   biggest operation since the spacecraft was launched in 2013.

Observing Gaia from Earth to improve its star maps

   2 May 2019While ESA's Gaia mission has been surveying more than one
   billion stars from space, astronomers have been regularly monitoring
   the satellite's position in the sky with telescopes across the world,
   including the European Southern Observatory in Chile, to further refine
   Gaia's orbit and ultimately improve the accuracy of its stellar census.

Hubble & Gaia accurately weigh the Milky Way [heic1905]

   7 March 2019In a striking example of multi-mission astronomy,
   measurements from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the ESA Gaia
   mission have been combined to improve the estimate of the mass of our
   home galaxy the Milky Way: 1.5 trillion solar masses.

Shedding light on white dwarfs – the future of stars like our Sun

   17 May 2019ESA's Gaia mission has been busy mapping our Milky Way
   galaxy since 2014, and just over one year ago released its second batch
   of data on more than one billion stars. Since then, astronomers have
   been exploring this catalogue to reveal a huge amount of new
   information about the cosmos. One type of object that has seen an
   abundance of new...

Rethinking everything we thought we knew about star clusters

   26 February 2019ESA's Gaia satellite is on a mission: to map and
   characterise more than one billion of the stars in the Milky Way. Many
   of these stars reside in complex, eye-catching clusters scattered
   throughout our Galaxy and, by studying these stellar groupings, Gaia is
   revealing much about the formation and evolution of stars in our cosmic
   home and...
