AIMS & SCOPE

   SEA, previously known as WEA (Workshop on Experimental Algorithms), is
   an international forum for researchers in the area of design, analysis,
   and experimental evaluation and engineering of algorithms, as well as
   in various aspects of computational optimization and its applications.
   The preceding symposia were held in Riga, Monte Verita, Rio de Janeiro,
   Santorini, Menorca Island, Rome, Cape Cod, Dortmund, Ischia Island, and
   Crete.

   The main theme of the symposium is the role of experimentation and of
   algorithm engineering techniques in the design and evaluation of
   algorithms and data structures. Submissions should present significant
   contributions supported by experimental evaluation, methodological
   issues in the design and interpretation of experiments, the use of
   (meta-)heuristics, or application-driven case studies that deepen the
   understanding of a problem's complexity.

PROCEEDINGS

   The SEA 2012 proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in the
   Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, Volume 7276.

SPECIAL ISSUE

   Selected papers from SEA 2012 will be considered for a special issue of
   the ACM Journal on Experimental Algorithmics.

VENUE

   SEA 2012 will take place at the LaBRI, Bordeaux, France.

   Bordeaux is located in the South West of France, in a region famous for
   its red wines and its gastronomy. The city centre of Bordeaux is
   classified at the Unesco World Heritage. The Atlantic Ocean is at about
   60 km westwards and there are good train connections to seaside towns
   such as Arcachon.
