Cool! Your Animated PNG images will also be optimized

   We are very happy that Chrome also supports APNG!

What does TinyPNG do?

   TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size
   of your PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in
   the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is
   nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!

Why should I use TinyPNG?

   PNG is useful because it’s the only widely supported format that can
   store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but
   the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your
   apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster.

Can anyone tell the difference?

   Excellent question! Let me give you a side by side comparison. Below
   are two photos of my cousin. The left image is saved as 24-bit PNG
   directly from Adobe Photoshop. On the right is the same image processed
   by TinyPNG. Spot any difference?

   Original file Original transparent PNG
   File size 57 KBvs Compressed transparent PNG file Shrunk transparent
   PNG
   File size 15 KB

How does it work?

   Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
   file, similar colors in your image are combined. This technique is
   called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG
   files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All
   unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result better PNG files with
   100% support for transparency. Have your cake and eat it too!

   In the above image the file size is reduced by more than 70%. I have
   excellent eyesight but can’t spot the difference either! Use the
   optimized image to save bandwidth and loading time and your website
   visitors will thank you.

Is it supported everywhere?

   Excellent question! The files produced by TinyPNG are displayed
   perfectly on all modern browsers including mobile devices. Still need
   to support Internet Explorer 6? It normally ignores PNG transparency
   and displays a solid background color. With TinyPNG the background
   becomes transparent again. Binary transparency without any workarounds!

Is it safe to use animated PNG?

   Excellent question! Chrome, Firefox and Safari all support APNG. Only
   Microsoft Edge does not support the format yet. If you have an Edge
   browser you can vote up APNG support on the Microsoft Developer
   Feedback site.

   Apple added animated stickers to iMessage with the release of iOS 10.
   If you want to create and compress stickers under 500 KB take a look at
   the iMessage Panda sticker example on Github.

What about Photoshop?

   Excellent question! Only Photoshop CC 2015, 2017 and 2018 can save
   images as indexed PNG files with alpha transparency. With other
   versions it is impossible and Photoshop CS5 cannot even display them
   properly.

   You can use Save for Web to export your images as 24-bit transparent
   PNG files and upload them to TinyPNG. We’ll convert them to tiny
   indexed PNG files. You can also install the TinyPNG Photoshop plugin.
   It allows you to scale, preview and save compressed PNG and JPEG images
   straight from Photoshop.

Why did you create TinyPNG?

   Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images, but were frustrated
   with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our own
   websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression. In 2014
   we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added
   support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free
   for everyone and we like to keep it that way! If you like TinyPNG
   please contribute by making a donation.
