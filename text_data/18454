   It‚Äôs a boy! Guests were treated to a giraffic birth this weekend.
   This is Harriet‚Äôs 5th calf, and the first offspring for sire, Fred.
   Given the recent news about the US considering listing giraffes as
   Endangered, each birth is a boost of hope for the species. Stick your
   neck out and join our virtual giraffe research team. YOU can make a
   difference from your mobile device or computer:

   Whale what do we have here? Scientists used to think hippos were
   closely related to pigs and other ungulates, but as genetic research
   advanced they discovered that hippos are much more closely related to
   cetaceans‚Äîwhales, porpoises, and dolphins. In fact, cetaceans are
   hippos‚Äô closest living relatives. Learn more about ü¶õs

   Penny is one pretty kitty, and basking in her beauty is a rare
   privilege. Snow leopards are rarely seen in the wild, as they live high
   in the mountains of Central Asia. Although the cats freely cross the
   international boundaries of 12 countries, their secretive behavior and
   remote habitat among the highest mountains in the world add to their
   mystery. Because of their shy behavior and uncanny, almost mystical
   ability to disappear among the rocks, snow leopards have entered the
   folklore of local peoples in many countries and have been described as
   shape-changing mountain spirits.
