   The Inevitable

Current Passions

Year 2019

   My title is Senior Maverick for Wired, a magazine I helped co-found 25
   years ago. I do one article for Wired per year. My most recent article
   is a cover story about augmented reality called Mirrorworld. It
   describes what I believe will be what happens after the web and smart
   phones. My other published writings are listed here, in chronological
   order.

   This is the 25th anniversary of my first book, Out of Control. It is
   about decentralized systems, emergent order, cryptocurrency,
   evolutionary design, robots and AI  — 25 years ago! Despite two decades
   of fast moving technology, it still reads like news. So in celebration
   of its 25 years, I have been tweeting one insight per day from the
   book. I tweet several times a week about other things
   under @kevin2kelly. On Facebook, I am the laughing Kevin Kelly.

   About three years ago I started a weekly newsletter, called Recomendo.
   Together with Mark Frauenfelder, of Boing Boing fame, and Claudia
   Dawson, our webmaster and my assistant, we give 6 very short
   recommendations each week. We briefly share in one page the great stuff
   we are watching, listening to, reading, cool tools we are enjoying, or
   great destinations we recommend. Recomendo now has 25,000 subscribers.
   Last Christmas we rounded up our best recommendations and produced a
   book — a physical book — with 500 plus suggestions. It is available on
   Amazon for less than $10. It was such a hit we also made a PDF version
   which you can download.

   I’m trying to finish visiting all the countries in Asia in order to
   document their disappearing traditions. From these I am compiling a
   photo book about the disappearing cultures of Asia, called Vanishing
   Asia. To be published a few years from now.

   Six years ago I published my first fiction, The Silver Cord. I worked
   on it for 11 years! At 464 oversized pages, this huge book was
   fan-funded, the result of a successful Kickstarter-funded campaign. It
   is now available on Amazon. The Silver Cord contains two volumes of an
   epic story about angels and robots and a girl hero who must save the
   humans in between. The craftsmanship of the printing, including a
   6-page fold out, is stunning. It has to be seen to be believed.
