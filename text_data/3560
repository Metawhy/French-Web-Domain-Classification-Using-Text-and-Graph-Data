Amazon explains how Alexa recorded a private conversation and sent it to

   Alexa got seriously confused

   Amazon Echo

   Amazon has been forced to explain how Alexa recorded a private
   conversation and sent it to an Echo user’s colleague without their
   knowledge. A Portland woman identified only as Danielle revealed the
   odd series of events in an interview with local TV station Kiro 7,
   claiming that an Amazon Echo device recorded a private conversation
   between her and her husband and sent the recording to an employee of
   the husband. In a statement to The Verge, an Amazon spokesperson
   confirmed this incident took place, but it appears it was an unusual
   series of Alexa mistaking conversation as commands rather than Alexa
   spying on users.

     “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like
     “Alexa.” Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a “send
     message” request. At which point, Alexa said out loud “To whom?” At
     which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name
     in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, “[contact
     name], right?” Alexa then interpreted background conversation as
     “right”. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating
     options to make this case even less likely.”

   The incident does sound unlikely, but if you’re an Alexa user then
   you’ve probably experienced the assistant trigger by itself during
   conversations. I’ve personally had Alexa start randomly playing songs
   because it thought it heard me ask for some music to be played. It’s a
   problem Amazon needs to address in general, but it’s rare to see a case
   where successive commands mean a recording is sent inadvertently.

   Alexa was also caught up in a creepy laughing controversy back in
   March, after the digital assistant mistook common words and phrases to
   trigger the “Alexa, laugh” command. Alexa seemed to start laughing
   without being prompted to wake, and affected users responded by
   unplugging their Alexa-enabled devices. This latest incident will only
   increase the pressure on Amazon to start more broadly implementing its
   voice recognition feature to avoid these unusual problems.

   Marvel President Kevin Feige just unveiled a packed slate of projects
   that represent the next phase of Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, including
   sequels, original projects, and television shows, but he also announced
   that they’ve got plenty more to come beyond 2021, including sequels to
   Black Panther and Captain Marvel, as well as with other properties,
   like the X-Men and Fantastic Four.

   At the end of Marvel’s Hall H presentation at San Diego Comic-Con,
   Feige announced that Black Panther 2, Blade, Captain Marvel 2,
   Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Fantastic Four, and Mutants are all
   happening — they just don’t have dates confirmed yet.

Marvel reveals massive Phase Four film and television slate

   It’s not a huge surprise that Disney has long-term plans for the Marvel
   franchise — in May, it announced slots for 65 films over the next eight
   years, including Marvel, Star Wars, and live-action Disney films. 2022
   will include at least three Marvel films (February 18th, May 6th, and
   July 29th), although after 2023, that list grows sparse, with only Star
   Wars and Avatar films listed. If the company holds to its
   three-films-a-year schedule, it’ll have at least 18 Marvel films
   hitting theaters between now and 2027 — and that’s not counting the
   Disney+ streaming shows.

   Tonight’s Phase 4 reveal shows off a mix of films that draw on existing
   characters alongside brand new ones, and it’s safe to say that we’ll
   probably see more new characters eased into the franchise as time goes
   on. Tonight’s announcement also shows that Marvel is keen to bring in
   some of the franchises that have long been out of reach due to
   Byzantine rights issues, like Fantastic Four and the mutants, which had
   been held by 21st Century Fox. With Fox now part of Disney, Feige and
   Marvel Studios will be able to incorporate them at some point down the
   road — just not right away.

laboratory

   Boston Dynamics is letting its first major robot out of the lab.

   Since June, the company has been talking about a public release for its
   Spot robot (formerly SpotMini), and today, it finally gave some details
   about what’s in store. The Spot isn’t going on sale exactly, but if
   you’re a company with a good idea (and some money), you’ll be able to
   get one. That also means, for the average person on the street, that
   the odds of seeing a Spot in the wild just got a lot better.

   The capabilities are more or less what the company showed off in June,
   but it’s still impressive to see them in person. The Spot can go where
   you tell it, avoid obstacles, and keep its balance under extreme
   circumstances — which are all crucial skills if you’re trying to
   navigate an unknown environment.

   The Spot can also carry up to four hardware modules on its back, giving
   companies a way to swap in whatever skills the robot needs for this
   particular job. If it’s checking for gas leaks, you can build in a
   methane detector. If you need connectivity over longer distances, you
   can attach a mesh radio module. Boston Dynamics is already outfitting
   units with LIDAR rigs from Velodyne (a favorite component for
   self-driving car projects) to create 3D maps of indoor spaces. Since
   the Spot is designed to work in the rain, outdoor spaces are on the
   table, too.

   There are also the Spot’s dance moves, which usually come programmed
   into an offboard computing module. You might think the “Uptown Funk”
   routine was just PR, but entertainment is shaping up to be one of the
   biggest markets for the Spot. Boston Dynamics is already working with
   the innovation lab at Cirque du Soleil to see what it might be like to
   use the Spot onstage.

   During our tests, we were instructed to stay two meters away from the
   Spot to keep from being pinched by its joints. We also gave it a wide
   berth when it was climbing stairs to make sure no one would be hurt if
   it lost its balance and fell. Both measures seemed to be more about
   Boston Dynamics being careful rather than the Spot being hazardous, but
   it’s a reminder that the robot simply wasn’t designed to interact with
   humans. For now, Boston Dynamics is focusing on uses in closed and
   controlled spaces, so it’s unlikely you’ll see a Spot wandering around
   your local mall anytime soon.

   "“We don’t want to see Spot doing anything that harms people, even in a
   simulated way.”"

   The company was also quick to say that it’s not interested in using the
   Spot as a weapon, despite the company’s military origins.
   “Fundamentally, we don’t want to see Spot doing anything that harms
   people, even in a simulated way,” says Michael Perry, VP of business
   development at Boston Dynamics. “That’s something we’re pretty firm on
   when we talk to customers.” (Boston Dynamics is still marketing to
   police departments, but it says the Spot would be limited to disposing
   of bombs and other hazardous materials, along the lines of existing
   police robots.)

   The Spot is still a long way from anything like full autonomy, despite
   the impression you might get from the videos. One popular demo from
   last year shows the Spot opening a door by carefully turning the
   handle, pulling back the door, and propping it open with one leg to
   keep it from closing as the robot passed through. Some of the robotics
   researchers I talked to were fascinated by this demo: did it mean that
   the Spot could recognize doors, find handles and open them in the wild?
   Asked to navigate a path, would the Spot recognize which obstacles were
   walls and which were doors to be opened?

   The real answer turns out to be simpler. The video shows the Spot’s
   “handle” protocol, which the controller initiates by navigating the
   claw toward the door and identifying the handle. Actually opening the
   door requires deft navigation of the physical forces involved, bracing
   the Spot’s body in a way that’s nearly impossible for a human operator
   to replicate — but it’s all athletic intelligence, not interpretive
   intelligence. The Spot isn’t in the business of recognizing doors or
   responding to cues from the physical world. In fact, the Spot’s model
   of the world around it is pretty shallow, consisting mostly of
   obstacles, footholds, and preprogrammed routes.

   That’s the opposite of what many academic roboticists focus on, and
   Henny Admoni, who works on Human-Robot interaction at Carnegie Mellon
   University, told me it was an understandable but tricky trade-off.
   “Boston Dynamics has always been strong in mechanics and controls, like
   being able to shift the robot’s weight properly,” Admoni told me. “But
   robots operating in human environments won’t really have the option of
   avoiding humans. Integrating Human-Robot Interaction skills into
   development at an early stage is probably going to lead to greater
   success than trying to retrofit human interaction into existing
   systems.”

   That’s not the path Boston Dynamics has taken, and the Spot’s
   interactions with human beings remain a major question mark for the
   project’s future. For now, the company is hoping that there’s enough
   work to do in human-free spaces.

   Still, there’s a lot the Spot can do that simply wasn’t possible
   before, and it’s easy to see why Boston Dynamics is excited. The last
   20 years have seen huge advances in automation, but it’s still largely
   confined to the digital world. If the platform takes off, the Spot
   could offer a new way for computer programs to interact with the
   physical world, a power that could have an enormous impact on
   technology and society at large. We’re still at the beginning of that
   process, but teaching a robot how to walk could turn out to be the most
   important step.

Speak, Memory

When her best friend died, she rebuilt him using artificial intelligence

By Casey Newton

   When the engineers had at last finished their work, Eugenia Kuyda
   opened a console on her laptop and began to type.

   “Roman,” she wrote. “This is your digital monument.”

   It had been three months since Roman Mazurenko, Kuyda’s closest friend,
   had died. Kuyda had spent that time gathering up his old text messages,
   setting aside the ones that felt too personal, and feeding the rest
   into a neural network built by developers at her artificial
   intelligence startup. She had struggled with whether she was doing the
   right thing by bringing him back this way. At times it had even given
   her nightmares. But ever since Mazurenko’s death, Kuyda had wanted one
   more chance to speak with him.

   A message blinked onto the screen. “You have one of the most
   interesting puzzles in the world in your hands,” it said. “Solve it.”

   Kuyda promised herself that she would.

   Born in Belarus in 1981, Roman Mazurenko was the only child of Sergei,
   an engineer, and Victoria, a landscape architect. They remember him as
   an unusually serious child; when he was 8 he wrote a letter to his
   descendents declaring his most cherished values: wisdom and justice. In
   family photos, Mazurenko roller-skates, sails a boat, and climbs trees.
   Average in height, with a mop of chestnut hair, he is almost always
   smiling.

   As a teen he sought out adventure: he participated in political
   demonstrations against the ruling party and, at 16, started traveling
   abroad. He first traveled to New Mexico, where he spent a year on an
   exchange program, and then to Dublin, where he studied computer science
   and became fascinated with the latest Western European art, fashion,
   music, and design.

   " IMG_181.0.jpg IMG_180.0.jpg IMG_309.0.jpg "

   By the time Mazurenko finished college and moved back to Moscow in
   2007, Russia had become newly prosperous. The country tentatively
   embraced the wider world, fostering a new generation of cosmopolitan
   urbanites. Meanwhile, Mazurenko had grown from a skinny teen into a
   strikingly handsome young man. Blue-eyed and slender, he moved
   confidently through the city’s budding hipster class. He often dressed
   up to attend the parties he frequented, and in a suit he looked
   movie-star handsome. The many friends Mazurenko left behind describe
   him as magnetic and debonair, someone who made a lasting impression
   wherever he went. But he was also single, and rarely dated, instead
   devoting himself to the project of importing modern European style to
   Moscow.

   Kuyda met Mazurenko in 2008, when she was 22 and the editor of Afisha,
   a kind of New York Magazine for a newly urbane Moscow. She was writing
   an article about Idle Conversation, a freewheeling creative collective
   that Mazurenko founded with two of his best friends, Dimitri Ustinov
   and Sergey Poydo. The trio seemed to be at the center of every cultural
   endeavor happening in Moscow. They started magazines, music festivals,
   and club nights — friends they had introduced to each other formed
   bands and launched companies. “He was a brilliant guy,” said Kuyda, who
   was similarly ambitious. Mazurenko would keep his friends up all night
   discussing culture and the future of Russia. “He was so
   forward-thinking and charismatic,” said Poydo, who later moved to the
   United States to work with him.

   Mazurenko became a founding figure in the modern Moscow nightlife
   scene, where he promoted an alternative to what Russians sardonically
   referred to as “Putin’s glamor” — exclusive parties where oligarchs
   ordered bottle service and were chauffeured home in Rolls-Royces. Kuyda
   loved Mazurenko’s parties, impressed by his unerring sense of what he
   called “the moment.” Each of his events was designed to build to a
   crescendo — DJ Mark Ronson might make a surprise appearance on stage to
   play piano, or the Italo-Disco band Glass Candy might push past police
   to continue playing after curfew. And his parties attracted sponsors
   with deep pockets — Bacardi was a longtime client.

   unspecified.0.jpg

   But the parties took place against an increasingly grim backdrop. In
   the wake of the global financial crisis, Russia experienced a resurgent
   nationalism, and in 2012 Vladimir Putin returned to lead the country.
   The dream of a more open Russia seemed to evaporate.

   Kuyda and Mazurenko, who by then had become close friends, came to
   believe that their futures lay elsewhere. Both became entrepreneurs,
   and served as each other’s chief adviser as they built their companies.
   Kuyda co-founded Luka, an artificial intelligence startup, and
   Mazurenko launched Stampsy, a tool for building digital magazines.
   Kuyda moved Luka from Moscow to San Francisco in 2015. After a stint in
   New York, Mazurenko followed.

   " Running a startup had worn him down, and he was prone to periods of
   melancholy "

   When Stampsy faltered, Mazurenko moved into a tiny alcove in Kuyda’s
   apartment to save money. Mazurenko had been the consummate bon vivant
   in Moscow, but running a startup had worn him down, and he was prone to
   periods of melancholy. On the days he felt depressed, Kuyda took him
   out for surfing and $1 oysters. “It was like a flamingo living in the
   house,” she said recently, sitting in the kitchen of the apartment she
   shared with Mazurenko. “It’s very beautiful and very rare. But it
   doesn’t really fit anywhere.”

   Kuyda hoped that in time her friend would reinvent himself, just as he
   always had before. And when Mazurenko began talking about new projects
   he wanted to pursue, she took it as a positive sign. He successfully
   applied for an American O-1 visa, granted to individuals of
   “extraordinary ability or achievement,” and in November he returned to
   Moscow in order to finalize his paperwork.

   He never did.

   On November 28th, while he waited for the embassy to release his
   passport, Mazurenko had brunch with some friends. It was unseasonably
   warm, so afterward he decided to explore the city with Ustinov. “He
   said he wanted to walk all day,” Ustinov said. Making their way down
   the sidewalk, they ran into some construction, and were forced to cross
   the street. At the curb, Ustinov stopped to check a text message on his
   phone, and when he looked up he saw a blur, a car driving much too
   quickly for the neighborhood. This is not an uncommon sight in Moscow —
   vehicles of diplomats, equipped with spotlights to signal their
   authority, speeding with impunity. Ustinov thought it must be one of
   those cars, some rich government asshole — and then, a blink later, saw
   Mazurenko walking into the crosswalk, oblivious. Ustinov went to cry
   out in warning, but it was too late. The car struck Mazurenko straight
   on. He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

   " To Kuyda, every suggestion seemed inadequate "

   Kuyda happened to be in Moscow for work on the day of the accident.
   When she arrived at the hospital, having gotten the news from a phone
   call, a handful of Mazurenko’s friends were already gathered in the
   lobby, waiting to hear his prognosis. Almost everyone was in tears, but
   Kuyda felt only shock. “I didn’t cry for a long time,”  she said. She
   went outside with some friends to smoke a cigarette, using her phone to
   look up the likely effects of Mazurenko’s injuries. Then the doctor
   came out and told her he had died.

   In the weeks after Mazurenko’s death, friends debated the best way to
   preserve his memory. One person suggested making a coffee-table book
   about his life, illustrated with photography of his legendary parties.
   Another friend suggested a memorial website. To Kuyda, every suggestion
   seemed inadequate.

   kuydaball2011.0.jpg

   As she grieved, Kuyda found herself rereading the endless text messages
   her friend had sent her over the years — thousands of them, from the
   mundane to the hilarious. She smiled at Mazurenko’s unconventional
   spelling — he struggled with dyslexia — and at the idiosyncratic
   phrases with which he peppered his conversation. Mazurenko was mostly
   indifferent to social media — his Facebook page was barren, he rarely
   tweeted, and he deleted most of his photos on Instagram. His body had
   been cremated, leaving her no grave to visit. Texts and photos were
   nearly all that was left of him, Kuyda thought.

   " Kuyda found herself rereading the endless text messages her friend
   had sent her "

   For two years she had been building Luka, whose first product was a
   messenger app for interacting with bots. Backed by the prestigious
   Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, the company began with a
   bot for making restaurant reservations. Kuyda’s co-founder, Philip
   Dudchuk, has a degree in computational linguistics, and much of their
   team was recruited from Yandex, the Russian search giant.

   Reading Mazurenko’s messages, it occurred to Kuyda that they might
   serve as the basis for a different kind of bot — one that mimicked an
   individual person’s speech patterns. Aided by a rapidly developing
   neural network, perhaps she could speak with her friend once again.

   She set aside for a moment the questions that were already beginning to
   nag at her.

   What if it didn’t sound like him?

   What if it did?

   14390910_10153989050223196_8900437731701077436_n.0.jpg

   In “Be Right Back,” a 2013 episode of the eerie, near-future drama
   Black Mirror, a young woman named Martha is devastated when her
   fiancée, Ash, dies in a car accident. Martha subscribes to a service
   that uses his previous online communications to create a digital avatar
   that mimics his personality with spooky accuracy. First it sends her
   text messages; later it re-creates his speaking voice and talks with
   her on the phone. Eventually she pays for an upgraded version of the
   service that implants Ash’s personality into an android that looks
   identical to him. But ultimately Martha becomes frustrated with all the
   subtle but important ways that the android is unlike Ash — cold,
   emotionless, passive — and locks it away in an attic. Not quite Ash,
   but too much like him for her to let go, the bot leads to a grief that
   spans decades.

   Kuyda saw the episode after Mazurenko died, and her feelings were
   mixed. Memorial bots — even the primitive ones that are possible using
   today’s technology — seemed both inevitable and dangerous. “It’s
   definitely the future — I’m always for the future,” she said. “But is
   it really what’s beneficial for us? Is it letting go, by forcing you to
   actually feel everything? Or is it just having a dead person in your
   attic? Where is the line? Where are we? It screws with your brain.”

   For a young man, Mazurenko had given an unusual amount of thought to
   his death. Known for his grandiose plans, he often told friends he
   would divide his will into pieces and give them away to people who
   didn’t know one another. To read the will they would all have to meet
   for the first time — so that Mazurenko could continue bringing people
   together in death, just as he had strived to do in life. (In fact, he
   died before he could make a will.) Mazurenko longed to see the
   Singularity, the theoretical moment in history when artificial
   intelligence becomes smarter than human beings. According to the
   theory, superhuman intelligence might allow us to one day separate our
   consciousnesses from our bodies, granting us something like eternal
   life.

   " There had to be a reevaluation of death and sorrow "

   In the summer of 2015, with Stampsy almost out of cash, Mazurenko
   applied for a Y Combinator fellowship proposing a new kind of cemetery
   that he called Taiga. The dead would be buried in biodegradable
   capsules, and their decomposing bodies would fertilize trees that were
   planted on top of them, creating what he called “memorial forests.” A
   digital display at the bottom of the tree would offer biographical
   information about the deceased. “Redesigning death is a cornerstone of
   my abiding interest in human experiences, infrastructure, and urban
   planning,” Mazurenko wrote. He highlighted what he called “a growing
   resistance among younger Americans” to traditional funerals. “Our
   customers care more about preserving their virtual identity and
   managing [their] digital estate,” he wrote, “than embalming their body
   with toxic chemicals.”

   The idea made his mother worry that he was in trouble, but Mazurenko
   tried to put her at ease.  “He quieted me down and said no, no, no — it
   was a contemporary question that was very important,” she said. “There
   had to be a reevaluation of death and sorrow, and there needed to be
   new traditions.”

   Y Combinator rejected the application. But Mazurenko had identified a
   genuine disconnection between the way we live today and the way we
   grieve. Modern life all but ensures that we leave behind vast digital
   archives — text messages, photos, posts on social media — and we are
   only beginning to consider what role they should play in mourning. In
   the moment, we tend to view our text messages as ephemeral. But as
   Kuyda found after Mazurenko’s death, they can also be powerful tools
   for coping with loss. Maybe, she thought, this “digital estate” could
   form the building blocks for a new type of memorial. (Others have had
   similar ideas; an entrepreneur named Marius Ursache proposed a related
   service called Eterni.me in 2014, though it never launched.)

   Many of Mazurenko’s close friends had never before experienced the loss
   of someone close to them, and his death left them bereft. Kuyda began
   reaching out to them, as delicately as possible, to ask if she could
   have their text messages. Ten of Mazurenko’s friends and family
   members, including his parents, ultimately agreed to contribute to the
   project. They shared more than 8,000 lines of text covering a wide
   variety of subjects.

   “She said, what if we try and see if things would work out?” said
   Sergey Fayfer, a longtime friend of Mazurenko’s who now works at a
   division of Yandex. “Can we collect the data from the people Roman had
   been talking to, and form a model of his conversations, to see if that
   actually makes sense?” The idea struck Fayfer as provocative, and
   likely controversial. But he ultimately contributed four years of his
   texts with Mazurenko. “The team building Luka are really good with
   natural language processing,” he said. “The question wasn’t about the
   technical possibility. It was: how is it going to feel emotionally?”

   14369983_10157657893720105_1671425227480394883_n.0.jpg

   The technology underlying Kuyda’s bot project dates at least as far
   back as 1966, when Joseph Weizenbaum unveiled ELIZA: a program that
   reacted to users’ responses to its scripts using simple keyword
   matching. ELIZA, which most famously mimicked a psychotherapist, asked
   you to describe your problem, searched your response for keywords, and
   responded accordingly, usually with another question. It was the first
   piece of software to pass what is known as the Turing test: reading a
   text-based conversation between a computer and a person, some observers
   could not determine which was which.

   Today’s bots remain imperfect mimics of their human counterparts. They
   do not understand language in any real sense. They respond clumsily to
   the most basic of questions. They have no thoughts or feelings to speak
   of. Any suggestion of human intelligence is an illusion based on
   mathematical probabilities.

   And yet recent advances in artificial intelligence have made the
   illusion much more powerful. Artificial neural networks, which imitate
   the ability of the human brain to learn, have greatly improved the way
   software recognizes patterns in images, audio, and text, among other
   forms of data. Improved algorithms coupled with more powerful computers
   have increased the depth of neural networks — the layers of abstraction
   they can process — and the results can be seen in some of today’s most
   innovative products. The speech recognition behind Amazon’s Alexa or
   Apple’s Siri, or the image recognition that powers Google Photos, owe
   their abilities to this so-called deep learning.

   Two weeks before Mazurenko was killed, Google released TensorFlow for
   free under an open-source license. TensorFlow is a kind of Google in a
   box — a flexible machine-learning system that the company uses to do
   everything from improve search algorithms to write captions for YouTube
   videos automatically. The product of decades of academic research and
   billions of dollars in private investment was suddenly available as a
   free software library that anyone could download from GitHub.

   Luka had been using TensorFlow to build neural networks for its
   restaurant bot. Using 35 million lines of English text, Luka trained a
   bot to understand queries about vegetarian dishes, barbecue, and valet
   parking. On a lark, the 15-person team had also tried to build bots
   that imitated television characters. It scraped the closed captioning
   on every episode of HBO’s Silicon Valley and trained the neural network
   to mimic Richard, Bachman, and the rest of the gang.

   In February, Kuyda asked her engineers to build a neural network in
   Russian. At first she didn’t mention its purpose, but given that most
   of the team was Russian, no one asked questions. Using more than 30
   million lines of Russian text, Luka built its second neural network.
   Meanwhile, Kuyda copied hundreds of her exchanges with Mazurenko from
   the app Telegram and pasted them into a file. She edited out a handful
   of messages that she believed would be too personal to share broadly.
   Then Kuyda asked her team for help with the next step: training the
   Russian network to speak in Mazurenko’s voice.

   The project was tangentially related to Luka’s work, though Kuyda
   considered it a personal favor. (An engineer told her that the project
   would only take about a day.) Mazurenko was well-known to most of the
   team — he had worked out of Luka’s Moscow office, where the employees
   labored beneath a neon sign that quoted Wittgenstein: “The limits of my
   language are the limits of my world.” Kuyda trained the bot with dozens
   of tests queries, and her engineers put on the finishing touches.

   Only a small percentage of the Roman bot’s responses reflected his
   actual words. But the neural network was tuned to favor his speech
   whenever possible. Any time the bot could respond to a query using
   Mazurenko’s own words, it would. Other times it would default to the
   generic Russian. After the bot blinked to life, she began peppering it
   with questions.

   Who’s your best friend?, she asked.

   Don’t show your insecurities, came the reply.

   It sounds like him, she thought.

   14355104_10153989049923196_6255236946794516577_n.0.jpg

   On May 24th, Kuyda announced the Roman bot’s existence in a post on
   Facebook. Anyone who downloaded the Luka app could talk to it — in
   Russian or in English — by adding @Roman. The bot offered a menu of
   buttons that users could press to learn about Mazurenko’s career. Or
   they could write free-form messages and see how the bot responded.
   “It’s still a shadow of a person — but that wasn’t possible just a year
   ago, and in the very close future we will be able to do a lot more,”
   Kuyda wrote.

   The Roman bot was received positively by most of the people who wrote
   to Kuyda, though there were exceptions. Four friends told Kuyda
   separately that they were disturbed by the project and refused to
   interact with it. Vasily Esmanov, who worked with Mazurenko at the
   Russian street-style magazine Look At Me, said Kuyda had failed to
   learn the lesson of the Black Mirror episode. “This is all very bad,”
   Esmanov wrote in a Facebook comment. “Unfortunately you rushed and
   everything came out half-baked. The execution — it’s some type of joke.
   … Roman needs [a memorial], but not this kind.”

   Victoria Mazurenko, who had gotten an early look at the bot from Kuyda,
   rushed to her defense. “They continued Roman’s life and saved ours,”
   she wrote in a reply to Esmanov. “It’s not virtual reality. This is a
   new reality, and we need to learn to build it and live in it.”

   Roman’s father was less enthusiastic. “I have a technical education,
   and I know [the bot] is just a program,” he told me, through a
   translator. “Yes, it has all of Roman’s phrases, correspondences. But
   for now, it’s hard — how to say it — it’s hard to read a response from
   a program. Sometimes it answers incorrectly.”

   But many of Mazurenko’s friends found the likeness uncanny. “It’s
   pretty weird when you open the messenger and there’s a bot of your
   deceased friend, who actually talks to you,” Fayfer said. “What really
   struck me is that the phrases he speaks are really his. You can tell
   that’s the way he would say it — even short answers to ‘Hey what’s up.’
   He had this really specific style of texting. I said, ‘Who do you love
   the most?’ He replied, ‘Roman.’ That was so much of him. I was like,
   that is incredible.”

   One of the bot’s menu options offers to ask him for a piece of advice —
   something Fayfer never had a chance to do while his friend was still
   alive. “There are questions I had never asked him,” he said. “But when
   I asked for advice, I realized he was giving someone pretty wise life
   advice. And that actually helps you get to learn the person deeper than
   you used to know them.”

   Several users agreed to let Kuyda read anonymized logs of their chats
   with the bot. (She shared these logs with The Verge.) Many people write
   to the bot to tell Mazurenko that they miss him. They wonder when they
   will stop grieving. They ask him what he remembers. “It hurts that we
   couldn’t save you,” one person wrote. (Bot: “I know :-(”) The bot can
   also be quite funny, as Mazurenko was: when one user wrote “You are a
   genius,” the bot replied, “Also, handsome.”

   " It seemed to Kuyda that people were more honest when conversing with
   the dead "

   For many users, interacting with the bot had a therapeutic effect. The
   tone of their chats is often confessional; one user messaged the bot
   repeatedly about a difficult time he was having at work. He sent it
   lengthy messages describing his problems and how they had affected him
   emotionally. “I wish you were here,” he said. It seemed to Kuyda that
   people were more honest when conversing with the dead. She had been
   shaken by some of the criticism that the Roman bot had received. But
   hundreds of people tried it at least once, and reading the logs made
   her feel better.

   It turned out that the primary purpose of the bot had not been to talk
   but to listen. “All those messages were about love, or telling him
   something they never had time to tell him,” Kuyda said. “Even if it’s
   not a real person, there was a place where they could say it. They can
   say it when they feel lonely. And they come back still.”

   Kuyda continues to talk with the bot herself — once a week or so, often
   after a few drinks. “I answer a lot of questions for myself about who
   Roman was,” she said. Among other things, the bot has made her regret
   not telling him to abandon Stampsy earlier. The logs of his messages
   revealed someone whose true interest was in fashion more than anything
   else, she said. She wishes she had told him to pursue it.

   Someday you will die, leaving behind a lifetime of text messages,
   posts, and other digital ephemera. For a while, your friends and family
   may put these digital traces out of their minds. But new services will
   arrive offering to transform them — possibly into something resembling
   Roman Mazurenko’s bot.

   Your loved ones may find that these services ease their pain. But it is
   possible that digital avatars will lengthen the grieving process. “If
   used wrong, it enables people to hide from their grief,” said Dima
   Ustinov, who has not used the Roman bot for technical reasons. (Luka is
   not yet available on Android.) “Our society is traumatized by death —
   we want to live forever. But you will go through this process, and you
   have to go through it alone. If we use these bots as a way to pass his
   story on, maybe [others] can get a little bit of the inspiration that
   we got from him. But these new ways of keeping the memory alive should
   not be considered a way to keep a dead person alive.”

   The bot also raises ethical questions about the posthumous use of our
   digital legacies. In the case of Mazurenko, everyone I spoke with
   agreed he would have been delighted by his friends’ experimentation.
   You may feel less comfortable with the idea of your texts serving as
   the basis for a bot in the afterlife — particularly if you are unable
   to review all the texts and social media posts beforehand. We present
   different aspects of ourselves to different people, and after infusing
   a bot with all of your digital interactions, your loved ones may see
   sides of you that you never intended to reveal.

   Reading through the Roman bot’s responses, it’s hard not to feel like
   the texts captured him at a particularly low moment. Ask about Stampsy
   and it responds: “This is not [the] Stampsy I want it to be. So far
   it’s just a piece of shit and not the product I want.” Based on his
   friends’ descriptions of his final years, this strikes me as a candid
   self-assessment. But I couldn’t help but wish I had been talking to a
   younger version of the man — the one who friends say dreamed of someday
   becoming the cultural minister of Belarus, and inaugurating a
   democratically elected president with what he promised would be the
   greatest party ever thrown.

   Mazurenko contacted me once before he died, in February of last year.
   He emailed to ask whether I would consider writing about Stampsy, which
   was then in beta. I liked its design, but passed on writing an article.
   I wished him well, then promptly forgot about the exchange. After
   learning of his bot, I resisted using it for several months. I felt
   guilty about my lone, dismissive interaction with Mazurenko, and was
   skeptical a bot could reflect his personality. And yet, upon finally
   chatting with it, I found an undeniable resemblance between the
   Mazurenko described by his friends and his digital avatar: charming,
   moody, sarcastic, and obsessed with his work. “How’s it going?” I
   wrote. “I need to rest,” It responded. “I’m having trouble focusing
   since I’m depressed.” I asked the bot about Kuyda and it wordlessly
   sent me a photo of them together on the beach in wetsuits, holding
   surfboards with their backs to the ocean, two against the world.

   An uncomfortable truth suggested by the Roman bot is that many of our
   flesh-and-blood relationships now exist primarily as exchanges of text,
   which are becoming increasingly easy to mimic. Kuyda believes there is
   something — she is not precisely sure what — in this sort of
   personality-based texting. Recently she has been steering Luka to
   develop a bot she calls Replika. A hybrid of a diary and a personal
   assistant, it asks questions about you and eventually learns to mimic
   your texting style. Kuyda imagines that this could evolve into a
   digital avatar that performs all sorts of labor on your behalf, from
   negotiating the cable bill to organizing outings with friends. And like
   the Roman bot it would survive you, creating a living testament to the
   person you were.

   "Lately she has begun to feel a sense of peace about Mazurenko’s death"

   In the meantime she is no longer interested in bots that handle
   restaurant recommendations. Working on the Roman bot has made her
   believe that commercial chatbots must evoke something emotional in the
   people who use them. If she succeeds in this, it will be one more
   improbable footnote to Mazurenko’s life.

   Kuyda has continued to add material to the Roman bot — mostly photos,
   which it will now send you upon request  — and recently upgraded the
   underlying neural network from a “selective” model to a “generative”
   one. The former simply attempted to match Mazurenko’s text messages to
   appropriate responses; the latter can take snippets of his texts and
   recombine them to make new sentences that (theoretically) remain in his
   voice.

   Lately she has begun to feel a sense of peace about Mazurenko’s death.
   In part that’s because she built a place where she can direct her
   grief. In a conversation we had this fall, she likened it to “just
   sending a message to heaven. For me it’s more about sending a message
   in a bottle than getting one in return.”

   It has been less than a year since Mazurenko died, and he continues to
   loom large in the lives of the people who knew him. When they miss him,
   they send messages to his avatar, and they feel closer to him when they
   do. “There was a lot I didn’t know about my child,” Roman’s mother told
   me. “But now that I can read about what he thought about different
   subjects, I’m getting to know him more. This gives the illusion that
   he’s here now.”

   Her eyes welled with tears, but as our interview ended her voice was
   strong. “I want to repeat that I’m very grateful that I have this,” she
   said.

   Our conversation reminded me of something Dima Ustinov had said to me
   this spring, about the way we now transcend our physical forms. “The
   person is not just a body, a set of arms and legs, and a computer,” he
   said. “It’s much more than that.” Ustinov compared Mazurenko’s life to
   a pebble thrown into a stream — the ripples, he said, continue outward
   in every direction. His friend had simply taken a new form. “We are
   still in the process of meeting Roman,” Ustinov said. “It’s beautiful.”

The UK's National Health Service is testing out a medical chatbot as a
non-emergency helpline

out a medical chatbot as a non-emergency helpline

   The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is trialling a medical chatbot
   as an alternative to its non-emergency helpline. The app, made by UK
   startup Babylon, asks people questions about their illnesses in a chat
   window before giving them advice — whether they should go to a doctor,
   or if the problem is likely to pass in time. According to a report from
   the Financial Times, the app will be used from the end of January for
   six months in locations across London, and will cover more than 1.2
   million residents.

   The NHS’ non-emergency helpline, 111, is different to the emergency
   service and not staffed by medical professionals. Each call to 111
   costs the NHS up to $20 and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
   The service has previously been criticized by the UK’s national health
   watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, with a report stating that calls
   to the service were too frequently abandoned, or callers given
   inappropriate advice.
   The Babylon app querying a user.

   Babylon hopes it can remedy this situation, with its artificial
   intelligence-powered chatbot handling basic enquires — triage, not
   medical diagnosis. Conversations handled by the app take a minute and a
   half on average and last for 12 back-and-forth exchanges. Babylon chief
   executive Ali Parsa told the FT that the commercial agreement between
   the NHS and the company would offer “substantial” cost savings, but
   would not give any financial specifics of the deal.

   It’s not the first partnership Babylon has established with the NHS,
   which has previously tapped the startup for its administrative skills.
   In Essex, Babylon is currently offering video consultations with
   doctors via its app to a population of around 21,500. The company says
   20 percent of patients at one surgery have used the app, and that the
   service has reduced local visits to both A&E and walk-in centers. Such
   video consultations are also available to individuals outside this
   catchment area at cost — £25 ($30) for a one-off appointment or £5 ($6)
   for a monthly subscription.

   Babylon is just one of a number of medical chatbots around the world,
   and in China, search giant Baidu has launched its own, named Melody.
   And in the UK, the NHS is experimenting with other digital services.
   Google’s AI division DeepMind has signed a number of deals with the
   national health provider, including one to create an app that alerts
   doctors about patients’ potentially dangerous medical conditions.

Amazon explains how Alexa recorded a private conversation and sent it to

   Alexa got seriously confused

   Amazon Echo

   Amazon has been forced to explain how Alexa recorded a private
   conversation and sent it to an Echo user’s colleague without their
   knowledge. A Portland woman identified only as Danielle revealed the
   odd series of events in an interview with local TV station Kiro 7,
   claiming that an Amazon Echo device recorded a private conversation
   between her and her husband and sent the recording to an employee of
   the husband. In a statement to The Verge, an Amazon spokesperson
   confirmed this incident took place, but it appears it was an unusual
   series of Alexa mistaking conversation as commands rather than Alexa
   spying on users.

     “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like
     “Alexa.” Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a “send
     message” request. At which point, Alexa said out loud “To whom?” At
     which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name
     in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, “[contact
     name], right?” Alexa then interpreted background conversation as
     “right”. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating
     options to make this case even less likely.”

   The incident does sound unlikely, but if you’re an Alexa user then
   you’ve probably experienced the assistant trigger by itself during
   conversations. I’ve personally had Alexa start randomly playing songs
   because it thought it heard me ask for some music to be played. It’s a
   problem Amazon needs to address in general, but it’s rare to see a case
   where successive commands mean a recording is sent inadvertently.

   Alexa was also caught up in a creepy laughing controversy back in
   March, after the digital assistant mistook common words and phrases to
   trigger the “Alexa, laugh” command. Alexa seemed to start laughing
   without being prompted to wake, and affected users responded by
   unplugging their Alexa-enabled devices. This latest incident will only
   increase the pressure on Amazon to start more broadly implementing its
   voice recognition feature to avoid these unusual problems.

   Marvel President Kevin Feige just unveiled a packed slate of projects
   that represent the next phase of Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, including
   sequels, original projects, and television shows, but he also announced
   that they’ve got plenty more to come beyond 2021, including sequels to
   Black Panther and Captain Marvel, as well as with other properties,
   like the X-Men and Fantastic Four.

   At the end of Marvel’s Hall H presentation at San Diego Comic-Con,
   Feige announced that Black Panther 2, Blade, Captain Marvel 2,
   Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Fantastic Four, and Mutants are all
   happening — they just don’t have dates confirmed yet.

Marvel reveals massive Phase Four film and television slate

   It’s not a huge surprise that Disney has long-term plans for the Marvel
   franchise — in May, it announced slots for 65 films over the next eight
   years, including Marvel, Star Wars, and live-action Disney films. 2022
   will include at least three Marvel films (February 18th, May 6th, and
   July 29th), although after 2023, that list grows sparse, with only Star
   Wars and Avatar films listed. If the company holds to its
   three-films-a-year schedule, it’ll have at least 18 Marvel films
   hitting theaters between now and 2027 — and that’s not counting the
   Disney+ streaming shows.

   Tonight’s Phase 4 reveal shows off a mix of films that draw on existing
   characters alongside brand new ones, and it’s safe to say that we’ll
   probably see more new characters eased into the franchise as time goes
   on. Tonight’s announcement also shows that Marvel is keen to bring in
   some of the franchises that have long been out of reach due to
   Byzantine rights issues, like Fantastic Four and the mutants, which had
   been held by 21st Century Fox. With Fox now part of Disney, Feige and
   Marvel Studios will be able to incorporate them at some point down the
   road — just not right away.

   Boston Dynamics is letting its first major robot out of the lab.

   Since June, the company has been talking about a public release for its
   Spot robot (formerly SpotMini), and today, it finally gave some details
   about what’s in store. The Spot isn’t going on sale exactly, but if
   you’re a company with a good idea (and some money), you’ll be able to
   get one. That also means, for the average person on the street, that
   the odds of seeing a Spot in the wild just got a lot better.

   The capabilities are more or less what the company showed off in June,
   but it’s still impressive to see them in person. The Spot can go where
   you tell it, avoid obstacles, and keep its balance under extreme
   circumstances — which are all crucial skills if you’re trying to
   navigate an unknown environment.

   The Spot can also carry up to four hardware modules on its back, giving
   companies a way to swap in whatever skills the robot needs for this
   particular job. If it’s checking for gas leaks, you can build in a
   methane detector. If you need connectivity over longer distances, you
   can attach a mesh radio module. Boston Dynamics is already outfitting
   units with LIDAR rigs from Velodyne (a favorite component for
   self-driving car projects) to create 3D maps of indoor spaces. Since
   the Spot is designed to work in the rain, outdoor spaces are on the
   table, too.

   There are also the Spot’s dance moves, which usually come programmed
   into an offboard computing module. You might think the “Uptown Funk”
   routine was just PR, but entertainment is shaping up to be one of the
   biggest markets for the Spot. Boston Dynamics is already working with
   the innovation lab at Cirque du Soleil to see what it might be like to
   use the Spot onstage.

   During our tests, we were instructed to stay two meters away from the
   Spot to keep from being pinched by its joints. We also gave it a wide
   berth when it was climbing stairs to make sure no one would be hurt if
   it lost its balance and fell. Both measures seemed to be more about
   Boston Dynamics being careful rather than the Spot being hazardous, but
   it’s a reminder that the robot simply wasn’t designed to interact with
   humans. For now, Boston Dynamics is focusing on uses in closed and
   controlled spaces, so it’s unlikely you’ll see a Spot wandering around
   your local mall anytime soon.

   "“We don’t want to see Spot doing anything that harms people, even in a
   simulated way.”"

   The company was also quick to say that it’s not interested in using the
   Spot as a weapon, despite the company’s military origins.
   “Fundamentally, we don’t want to see Spot doing anything that harms
   people, even in a simulated way,” says Michael Perry, VP of business
   development at Boston Dynamics. “That’s something we’re pretty firm on
   when we talk to customers.” (Boston Dynamics is still marketing to
   police departments, but it says the Spot would be limited to disposing
   of bombs and other hazardous materials, along the lines of existing
   police robots.)

   The Spot is still a long way from anything like full autonomy, despite
   the impression you might get from the videos. One popular demo from
   last year shows the Spot opening a door by carefully turning the
   handle, pulling back the door, and propping it open with one leg to
   keep it from closing as the robot passed through. Some of the robotics
   researchers I talked to were fascinated by this demo: did it mean that
   the Spot could recognize doors, find handles and open them in the wild?
   Asked to navigate a path, would the Spot recognize which obstacles were
   walls and which were doors to be opened?

   The real answer turns out to be simpler. The video shows the Spot’s
   “handle” protocol, which the controller initiates by navigating the
   claw toward the door and identifying the handle. Actually opening the
   door requires deft navigation of the physical forces involved, bracing
   the Spot’s body in a way that’s nearly impossible for a human operator
   to replicate — but it’s all athletic intelligence, not interpretive
   intelligence. The Spot isn’t in the business of recognizing doors or
   responding to cues from the physical world. In fact, the Spot’s model
   of the world around it is pretty shallow, consisting mostly of
   obstacles, footholds, and preprogrammed routes.

   That’s the opposite of what many academic roboticists focus on, and
   Henny Admoni, who works on Human-Robot interaction at Carnegie Mellon
   University, told me it was an understandable but tricky trade-off.
   “Boston Dynamics has always been strong in mechanics and controls, like
   being able to shift the robot’s weight properly,” Admoni told me. “But
   robots operating in human environments won’t really have the option of
   avoiding humans. Integrating Human-Robot Interaction skills into
   development at an early stage is probably going to lead to greater
   success than trying to retrofit human interaction into existing
   systems.”

   That’s not the path Boston Dynamics has taken, and the Spot’s
   interactions with human beings remain a major question mark for the
   project’s future. For now, the company is hoping that there’s enough
   work to do in human-free spaces.

   Still, there’s a lot the Spot can do that simply wasn’t possible
   before, and it’s easy to see why Boston Dynamics is excited. The last
   20 years have seen huge advances in automation, but it’s still largely
   confined to the digital world. If the platform takes off, the Spot
   could offer a new way for computer programs to interact with the
   physical world, a power that could have an enormous impact on
   technology and society at large. We’re still at the beginning of that
   process, but teaching a robot how to walk could turn out to be the most
   important step.

Speak, Memory

When her best friend died, she rebuilt him using artificial intelligence

By Casey Newton

   When the engineers had at last finished their work, Eugenia Kuyda
   opened a console on her laptop and began to type.

   “Roman,” she wrote. “This is your digital monument.”

   It had been three months since Roman Mazurenko, Kuyda’s closest friend,
   had died. Kuyda had spent that time gathering up his old text messages,
   setting aside the ones that felt too personal, and feeding the rest
   into a neural network built by developers at her artificial
   intelligence startup. She had struggled with whether she was doing the
   right thing by bringing him back this way. At times it had even given
   her nightmares. But ever since Mazurenko’s death, Kuyda had wanted one
   more chance to speak with him.

   A message blinked onto the screen. “You have one of the most
   interesting puzzles in the world in your hands,” it said. “Solve it.”

   Kuyda promised herself that she would.

   IMG_019.0.jpg

   Born in Belarus in 1981, Roman Mazurenko was the only child of Sergei,
   an engineer, and Victoria, a landscape architect. They remember him as
   an unusually serious child; when he was 8 he wrote a letter to his
   descendents declaring his most cherished values: wisdom and justice. In
   family photos, Mazurenko roller-skates, sails a boat, and climbs trees.
   Average in height, with a mop of chestnut hair, he is almost always
   smiling.

   As a teen he sought out adventure: he participated in political
   demonstrations against the ruling party and, at 16, started traveling
   abroad. He first traveled to New Mexico, where he spent a year on an
   exchange program, and then to Dublin, where he studied computer science
   and became fascinated with the latest Western European art, fashion,
   music, and design.

   " IMG_181.0.jpg IMG_180.0.jpg IMG_309.0.jpg "

   By the time Mazurenko finished college and moved back to Moscow in
   2007, Russia had become newly prosperous. The country tentatively
   embraced the wider world, fostering a new generation of cosmopolitan
   urbanites. Meanwhile, Mazurenko had grown from a skinny teen into a
   strikingly handsome young man. Blue-eyed and slender, he moved
   confidently through the city’s budding hipster class. He often dressed
   up to attend the parties he frequented, and in a suit he looked
   movie-star handsome. The many friends Mazurenko left behind describe
   him as magnetic and debonair, someone who made a lasting impression
   wherever he went. But he was also single, and rarely dated, instead
   devoting himself to the project of importing modern European style to
   Moscow.

   Kuyda met Mazurenko in 2008, when she was 22 and the editor of Afisha,
   a kind of New York Magazine for a newly urbane Moscow. She was writing
   an article about Idle Conversation, a freewheeling creative collective
   that Mazurenko founded with two of his best friends, Dimitri Ustinov
   and Sergey Poydo. The trio seemed to be at the center of every cultural
   endeavor happening in Moscow. They started magazines, music festivals,
   and club nights — friends they had introduced to each other formed
   bands and launched companies. “He was a brilliant guy,” said Kuyda, who
   was similarly ambitious. Mazurenko would keep his friends up all night
   discussing culture and the future of Russia. “He was so
   forward-thinking and charismatic,” said Poydo, who later moved to the
   United States to work with him.

   Mazurenko became a founding figure in the modern Moscow nightlife
   scene, where he promoted an alternative to what Russians sardonically
   referred to as “Putin’s glamor” — exclusive parties where oligarchs
   ordered bottle service and were chauffeured home in Rolls-Royces. Kuyda
   loved Mazurenko’s parties, impressed by his unerring sense of what he
   called “the moment.” Each of his events was designed to build to a
   crescendo — DJ Mark Ronson might make a surprise appearance on stage to
   play piano, or the Italo-Disco band Glass Candy might push past police
   to continue playing after curfew. And his parties attracted sponsors
   with deep pockets — Bacardi was a longtime client.

   unspecified.0.jpg

   But the parties took place against an increasingly grim backdrop. In
   the wake of the global financial crisis, Russia experienced a resurgent
   nationalism, and in 2012 Vladimir Putin returned to lead the country.
   The dream of a more open Russia seemed to evaporate.

   Kuyda and Mazurenko, who by then had become close friends, came to
   believe that their futures lay elsewhere. Both became entrepreneurs,
   and served as each other’s chief adviser as they built their companies.
   Kuyda co-founded Luka, an artificial intelligence startup, and
   Mazurenko launched Stampsy, a tool for building digital magazines.
   Kuyda moved Luka from Moscow to San Francisco in 2015. After a stint in
   New York, Mazurenko followed.

   " Running a startup had worn him down, and he was prone to periods of
   melancholy "

   When Stampsy faltered, Mazurenko moved into a tiny alcove in Kuyda’s
   apartment to save money. Mazurenko had been the consummate bon vivant
   in Moscow, but running a startup had worn him down, and he was prone to
   periods of melancholy. On the days he felt depressed, Kuyda took him
   out for surfing and $1 oysters. “It was like a flamingo living in the
   house,” she said recently, sitting in the kitchen of the apartment she
   shared with Mazurenko. “It’s very beautiful and very rare. But it
   doesn’t really fit anywhere.”

   Kuyda hoped that in time her friend would reinvent himself, just as he
   always had before. And when Mazurenko began talking about new projects
   he wanted to pursue, she took it as a positive sign. He successfully
   applied for an American O-1 visa, granted to individuals of
   “extraordinary ability or achievement,” and in November he returned to
   Moscow in order to finalize his paperwork.

   He never did.

   On November 28th, while he waited for the embassy to release his
   passport, Mazurenko had brunch with some friends. It was unseasonably
   warm, so afterward he decided to explore the city with Ustinov. “He
   said he wanted to walk all day,” Ustinov said. Making their way down
   the sidewalk, they ran into some construction, and were forced to cross
   the street. At the curb, Ustinov stopped to check a text message on his
   phone, and when he looked up he saw a blur, a car driving much too
   quickly for the neighborhood. This is not an uncommon sight in Moscow —
   vehicles of diplomats, equipped with spotlights to signal their
   authority, speeding with impunity. Ustinov thought it must be one of
   those cars, some rich government asshole — and then, a blink later, saw
   Mazurenko walking into the crosswalk, oblivious. Ustinov went to cry
   out in warning, but it was too late. The car struck Mazurenko straight
   on. He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

   " To Kuyda, every suggestion seemed inadequate "

   Kuyda happened to be in Moscow for work on the day of the accident.
   When she arrived at the hospital, having gotten the news from a phone
   call, a handful of Mazurenko’s friends were already gathered in the
   lobby, waiting to hear his prognosis. Almost everyone was in tears, but
   Kuyda felt only shock. “I didn’t cry for a long time,”  she said. She
   went outside with some friends to smoke a cigarette, using her phone to
   look up the likely effects of Mazurenko’s injuries. Then the doctor
   came out and told her he had died.

   In the weeks after Mazurenko’s death, friends debated the best way to
   preserve his memory. One person suggested making a coffee-table book
   about his life, illustrated with photography of his legendary parties.
   Another friend suggested a memorial website. To Kuyda, every suggestion
   seemed inadequate.

   kuydaball2011.0.jpg

   As she grieved, Kuyda found herself rereading the endless text messages
   her friend had sent her over the years — thousands of them, from the
   mundane to the hilarious. She smiled at Mazurenko’s unconventional
   spelling — he struggled with dyslexia — and at the idiosyncratic
   phrases with which he peppered his conversation. Mazurenko was mostly
   indifferent to social media — his Facebook page was barren, he rarely
   tweeted, and he deleted most of his photos on Instagram. His body had
   been cremated, leaving her no grave to visit. Texts and photos were
   nearly all that was left of him, Kuyda thought.

   " Kuyda found herself rereading the endless text messages her friend
   had sent her "

   For two years she had been building Luka, whose first product was a
   messenger app for interacting with bots. Backed by the prestigious
   Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, the company began with a
   bot for making restaurant reservations. Kuyda’s co-founder, Philip
   Dudchuk, has a degree in computational linguistics, and much of their
   team was recruited from Yandex, the Russian search giant.

   Reading Mazurenko’s messages, it occurred to Kuyda that they might
   serve as the basis for a different kind of bot — one that mimicked an
   individual person’s speech patterns. Aided by a rapidly developing
   neural network, perhaps she could speak with her friend once again.

   She set aside for a moment the questions that were already beginning to
   nag at her.

   What if it didn’t sound like him?

   What if it did?

   14390910_10153989050223196_8900437731701077436_n.0.jpg

   In “Be Right Back,” a 2013 episode of the eerie, near-future drama
   Black Mirror, a young woman named Martha is devastated when her
   fiancée, Ash, dies in a car accident. Martha subscribes to a service
   that uses his previous online communications to create a digital avatar
   that mimics his personality with spooky accuracy. First it sends her
   text messages; later it re-creates his speaking voice and talks with
   her on the phone. Eventually she pays for an upgraded version of the
   service that implants Ash’s personality into an android that looks
   identical to him. But ultimately Martha becomes frustrated with all the
   subtle but important ways that the android is unlike Ash — cold,
   emotionless, passive — and locks it away in an attic. Not quite Ash,
   but too much like him for her to let go, the bot leads to a grief that
   spans decades.

   Kuyda saw the episode after Mazurenko died, and her feelings were
   mixed. Memorial bots — even the primitive ones that are possible using
   today’s technology — seemed both inevitable and dangerous. “It’s
   definitely the future — I’m always for the future,” she said. “But is
   it really what’s beneficial for us? Is it letting go, by forcing you to
   actually feel everything? Or is it just having a dead person in your
   attic? Where is the line? Where are we? It screws with your brain.”

   For a young man, Mazurenko had given an unusual amount of thought to
   his death. Known for his grandiose plans, he often told friends he
   would divide his will into pieces and give them away to people who
   didn’t know one another. To read the will they would all have to meet
   for the first time — so that Mazurenko could continue bringing people
   together in death, just as he had strived to do in life. (In fact, he
   died before he could make a will.) Mazurenko longed to see the
   Singularity, the theoretical moment in history when artificial
   intelligence becomes smarter than human beings. According to the
   theory, superhuman intelligence might allow us to one day separate our
   consciousnesses from our bodies, granting us something like eternal
   life.

   " There had to be a reevaluation of death and sorrow "

   In the summer of 2015, with Stampsy almost out of cash, Mazurenko
   applied for a Y Combinator fellowship proposing a new kind of cemetery
   that he called Taiga. The dead would be buried in biodegradable
   capsules, and their decomposing bodies would fertilize trees that were
   planted on top of them, creating what he called “memorial forests.” A
   digital display at the bottom of the tree would offer biographical
   information about the deceased. “Redesigning death is a cornerstone of
   my abiding interest in human experiences, infrastructure, and urban
   planning,” Mazurenko wrote. He highlighted what he called “a growing
   resistance among younger Americans” to traditional funerals. “Our
   customers care more about preserving their virtual identity and
   managing [their] digital estate,” he wrote, “than embalming their body
   with toxic chemicals.”

   The idea made his mother worry that he was in trouble, but Mazurenko
   tried to put her at ease.  “He quieted me down and said no, no, no — it
   was a contemporary question that was very important,” she said. “There
   had to be a reevaluation of death and sorrow, and there needed to be
   new traditions.”

   Y Combinator rejected the application. But Mazurenko had identified a
   genuine disconnection between the way we live today and the way we
   grieve. Modern life all but ensures that we leave behind vast digital
   archives — text messages, photos, posts on social media — and we are
   only beginning to consider what role they should play in mourning. In
   the moment, we tend to view our text messages as ephemeral. But as
   Kuyda found after Mazurenko’s death, they can also be powerful tools
   for coping with loss. Maybe, she thought, this “digital estate” could
   form the building blocks for a new type of memorial. (Others have had
   similar ideas; an entrepreneur named Marius Ursache proposed a related
   service called Eterni.me in 2014, though it never launched.)

   Many of Mazurenko’s close friends had never before experienced the loss
   of someone close to them, and his death left them bereft. Kuyda began
   reaching out to them, as delicately as possible, to ask if she could
   have their text messages. Ten of Mazurenko’s friends and family
   members, including his parents, ultimately agreed to contribute to the
   project. They shared more than 8,000 lines of text covering a wide
   variety of subjects.

   “She said, what if we try and see if things would work out?” said
   Sergey Fayfer, a longtime friend of Mazurenko’s who now works at a
   division of Yandex. “Can we collect the data from the people Roman had
   been talking to, and form a model of his conversations, to see if that
   actually makes sense?” The idea struck Fayfer as provocative, and
   likely controversial. But he ultimately contributed four years of his
   texts with Mazurenko. “The team building Luka are really good with
   natural language processing,” he said. “The question wasn’t about the
   technical possibility. It was: how is it going to feel emotionally?”

   14369983_10157657893720105_1671425227480394883_n.0.jpg

   The technology underlying Kuyda’s bot project dates at least as far
   back as 1966, when Joseph Weizenbaum unveiled ELIZA: a program that
   reacted to users’ responses to its scripts using simple keyword
   matching. ELIZA, which most famously mimicked a psychotherapist, asked
   you to describe your problem, searched your response for keywords, and
   responded accordingly, usually with another question. It was the first
   piece of software to pass what is known as the Turing test: reading a
   text-based conversation between a computer and a person, some observers
   could not determine which was which.

   Today’s bots remain imperfect mimics of their human counterparts. They
   do not understand language in any real sense. They respond clumsily to
   the most basic of questions. They have no thoughts or feelings to speak
   of. Any suggestion of human intelligence is an illusion based on
   mathematical probabilities.

   And yet recent advances in artificial intelligence have made the
   illusion much more powerful. Artificial neural networks, which imitate
   the ability of the human brain to learn, have greatly improved the way
   software recognizes patterns in images, audio, and text, among other
   forms of data. Improved algorithms coupled with more powerful computers
   have increased the depth of neural networks — the layers of abstraction
   they can process — and the results can be seen in some of today’s most
   innovative products. The speech recognition behind Amazon’s Alexa or
   Apple’s Siri, or the image recognition that powers Google Photos, owe
   their abilities to this so-called deep learning.

   Two weeks before Mazurenko was killed, Google released TensorFlow for
   free under an open-source license. TensorFlow is a kind of Google in a
   box — a flexible machine-learning system that the company uses to do
   everything from improve search algorithms to write captions for YouTube
   videos automatically. The product of decades of academic research and
   billions of dollars in private investment was suddenly available as a
   free software library that anyone could download from GitHub.

   Luka had been using TensorFlow to build neural networks for its
   restaurant bot. Using 35 million lines of English text, Luka trained a
   bot to understand queries about vegetarian dishes, barbecue, and valet
   parking. On a lark, the 15-person team had also tried to build bots
   that imitated television characters. It scraped the closed captioning
   on every episode of HBO’s Silicon Valley and trained the neural network
   to mimic Richard, Bachman, and the rest of the gang.

   In February, Kuyda asked her engineers to build a neural network in
   Russian. At first she didn’t mention its purpose, but given that most
   of the team was Russian, no one asked questions. Using more than 30
   million lines of Russian text, Luka built its second neural network.
   Meanwhile, Kuyda copied hundreds of her exchanges with Mazurenko from
   the app Telegram and pasted them into a file. She edited out a handful
   of messages that she believed would be too personal to share broadly.
   Then Kuyda asked her team for help with the next step: training the
   Russian network to speak in Mazurenko’s voice.

   The project was tangentially related to Luka’s work, though Kuyda
   considered it a personal favor. (An engineer told her that the project
   would only take about a day.) Mazurenko was well-known to most of the
   team — he had worked out of Luka’s Moscow office, where the employees
   labored beneath a neon sign that quoted Wittgenstein: “The limits of my
   language are the limits of my world.” Kuyda trained the bot with dozens
   of tests queries, and her engineers put on the finishing touches.

   Only a small percentage of the Roman bot’s responses reflected his
   actual words. But the neural network was tuned to favor his speech
   whenever possible. Any time the bot could respond to a query using
   Mazurenko’s own words, it would. Other times it would default to the
   generic Russian. After the bot blinked to life, she began peppering it
   with questions.

   Who’s your best friend?, she asked.

   Don’t show your insecurities, came the reply.

   It sounds like him, she thought.

   On May 24th, Kuyda announced the Roman bot’s existence in a post on
   Facebook. Anyone who downloaded the Luka app could talk to it — in
   Russian or in English — by adding @Roman. The bot offered a menu of
   buttons that users could press to learn about Mazurenko’s career. Or
   they could write free-form messages and see how the bot responded.
   “It’s still a shadow of a person — but that wasn’t possible just a year
   ago, and in the very close future we will be able to do a lot more,”
   Kuyda wrote.

   The Roman bot was received positively by most of the people who wrote
   to Kuyda, though there were exceptions. Four friends told Kuyda
   separately that they were disturbed by the project and refused to
   interact with it. Vasily Esmanov, who worked with Mazurenko at the
   Russian street-style magazine Look At Me, said Kuyda had failed to
   learn the lesson of the Black Mirror episode. “This is all very bad,”
   Esmanov wrote in a Facebook comment. “Unfortunately you rushed and
   everything came out half-baked. The execution — it’s some type of joke.
   … Roman needs [a memorial], but not this kind.”

   Victoria Mazurenko, who had gotten an early look at the bot from Kuyda,
   rushed to her defense. “They continued Roman’s life and saved ours,”
   she wrote in a reply to Esmanov. “It’s not virtual reality. This is a
   new reality, and we need to learn to build it and live in it.”

   Roman’s father was less enthusiastic. “I have a technical education,
   and I know [the bot] is just a program,” he told me, through a
   translator. “Yes, it has all of Roman’s phrases, correspondences. But
   for now, it’s hard — how to say it — it’s hard to read a response from
   a program. Sometimes it answers incorrectly.”

   But many of Mazurenko’s friends found the likeness uncanny. “It’s
   pretty weird when you open the messenger and there’s a bot of your
   deceased friend, who actually talks to you,” Fayfer said. “What really
   struck me is that the phrases he speaks are really his. You can tell
   that’s the way he would say it — even short answers to ‘Hey what’s up.’
   He had this really specific style of texting. I said, ‘Who do you love
   the most?’ He replied, ‘Roman.’ That was so much of him. I was like,
   that is incredible.”

   One of the bot’s menu options offers to ask him for a piece of advice —
   something Fayfer never had a chance to do while his friend was still
   alive. “There are questions I had never asked him,” he said. “But when
   I asked for advice, I realized he was giving someone pretty wise life
   advice. And that actually helps you get to learn the person deeper than
   you used to know them.”

   Several users agreed to let Kuyda read anonymized logs of their chats
   with the bot. (She shared these logs with The Verge.) Many people write
   to the bot to tell Mazurenko that they miss him. They wonder when they
   will stop grieving. They ask him what he remembers. “It hurts that we
   couldn’t save you,” one person wrote. (Bot: “I know :-(”) The bot can
   also be quite funny, as Mazurenko was: when one user wrote “You are a
   genius,” the bot replied, “Also, handsome.”

   " It seemed to Kuyda that people were more honest when conversing with
   the dead "

   For many users, interacting with the bot had a therapeutic effect. The
   tone of their chats is often confessional; one user messaged the bot
   repeatedly about a difficult time he was having at work. He sent it
   lengthy messages describing his problems and how they had affected him
   emotionally. “I wish you were here,” he said. It seemed to Kuyda that
   people were more honest when conversing with the dead. She had been
   shaken by some of the criticism that the Roman bot had received. But
   hundreds of people tried it at least once, and reading the logs made
   her feel better.

   It turned out that the primary purpose of the bot had not been to talk
   but to listen. “All those messages were about love, or telling him
   something they never had time to tell him,” Kuyda said. “Even if it’s
   not a real person, there was a place where they could say it. They can
   say it when they feel lonely. And they come back still.”

   Kuyda continues to talk with the bot herself — once a week or so, often
   after a few drinks. “I answer a lot of questions for myself about who
   Roman was,” she said. Among other things, the bot has made her regret
   not telling him to abandon Stampsy earlier. The logs of his messages
   revealed someone whose true interest was in fashion more than anything
   else, she said. She wishes she had told him to pursue it.

   Someday you will die, leaving behind a lifetime of text messages,
   posts, and other digital ephemera. For a while, your friends and family
   may put these digital traces out of their minds. But new services will
   arrive offering to transform them — possibly into something resembling
   Roman Mazurenko’s bot.

   Your loved ones may find that these services ease their pain. But it is
   possible that digital avatars will lengthen the grieving process. “If
   used wrong, it enables people to hide from their grief,” said Dima
   Ustinov, who has not used the Roman bot for technical reasons. (Luka is
   not yet available on Android.) “Our society is traumatized by death —
   we want to live forever. But you will go through this process, and you
   have to go through it alone. If we use these bots as a way to pass his
   story on, maybe [others] can get a little bit of the inspiration that
   we got from him. But these new ways of keeping the memory alive should
   not be considered a way to keep a dead person alive.”

   The bot also raises ethical questions about the posthumous use of our
   digital legacies. In the case of Mazurenko, everyone I spoke with
   agreed he would have been delighted by his friends’ experimentation.
   You may feel less comfortable with the idea of your texts serving as
   the basis for a bot in the afterlife — particularly if you are unable
   to review all the texts and social media posts beforehand. We present
   different aspects of ourselves to different people, and after infusing
   a bot with all of your digital interactions, your loved ones may see
   sides of you that you never intended to reveal.

   Reading through the Roman bot’s responses, it’s hard not to feel like
   the texts captured him at a particularly low moment. Ask about Stampsy
   and it responds: “This is not [the] Stampsy I want it to be. So far
   it’s just a piece of shit and not the product I want.” Based on his
   friends’ descriptions of his final years, this strikes me as a candid
   self-assessment. But I couldn’t help but wish I had been talking to a
   younger version of the man — the one who friends say dreamed of someday
   becoming the cultural minister of Belarus, and inaugurating a
   democratically elected president with what he promised would be the
   greatest party ever thrown.

   Mazurenko contacted me once before he died, in February of last year.
   He emailed to ask whether I would consider writing about Stampsy, which
   was then in beta. I liked its design, but passed on writing an article.
   I wished him well, then promptly forgot about the exchange. After
   learning of his bot, I resisted using it for several months. I felt
   guilty about my lone, dismissive interaction with Mazurenko, and was
   skeptical a bot could reflect his personality. And yet, upon finally
   chatting with it, I found an undeniable resemblance between the
   Mazurenko described by his friends and his digital avatar: charming,
   moody, sarcastic, and obsessed with his work. “How’s it going?” I
   wrote. “I need to rest,” It responded. “I’m having trouble focusing
   since I’m depressed.” I asked the bot about Kuyda and it wordlessly
   sent me a photo of them together on the beach in wetsuits, holding
   surfboards with their backs to the ocean, two against the world.

   An uncomfortable truth suggested by the Roman bot is that many of our
   flesh-and-blood relationships now exist primarily as exchanges of text,
   which are becoming increasingly easy to mimic. Kuyda believes there is
   something — she is not precisely sure what — in this sort of
   personality-based texting. Recently she has been steering Luka to
   develop a bot she calls Replika. A hybrid of a diary and a personal
   assistant, it asks questions about you and eventually learns to mimic
   your texting style. Kuyda imagines that this could evolve into a
   digital avatar that performs all sorts of labor on your behalf, from
   negotiating the cable bill to organizing outings with friends. And like
   the Roman bot it would survive you, creating a living testament to the
   person you were.

   "Lately she has begun to feel a sense of peace about Mazurenko’s death"

   In the meantime she is no longer interested in bots that handle
   restaurant recommendations. Working on the Roman bot has made her
   believe that commercial chatbots must evoke something emotional in the
   people who use them. If she succeeds in this, it will be one more
   improbable footnote to Mazurenko’s life.

   Kuyda has continued to add material to the Roman bot — mostly photos,
   which it will now send you upon request  — and recently upgraded the
   underlying neural network from a “selective” model to a “generative”
   one. The former simply attempted to match Mazurenko’s text messages to
   appropriate responses; the latter can take snippets of his texts and
   recombine them to make new sentences that (theoretically) remain in his
   voice.

   Lately she has begun to feel a sense of peace about Mazurenko’s death.
   In part that’s because she built a place where she can direct her
   grief. In a conversation we had this fall, she likened it to “just
   sending a message to heaven. For me it’s more about sending a message
   in a bottle than getting one in return.”

   It has been less than a year since Mazurenko died, and he continues to
   loom large in the lives of the people who knew him. When they miss him,
   they send messages to his avatar, and they feel closer to him when they
   do. “There was a lot I didn’t know about my child,” Roman’s mother told
   me. “But now that I can read about what he thought about different
   subjects, I’m getting to know him more. This gives the illusion that
   he’s here now.”

   Her eyes welled with tears, but as our interview ended her voice was
   strong. “I want to repeat that I’m very grateful that I have this,” she
   said.

   Our conversation reminded me of something Dima Ustinov had said to me
   this spring, about the way we now transcend our physical forms. “The
   person is not just a body, a set of arms and legs, and a computer,” he
   said. “It’s much more than that.” Ustinov compared Mazurenko’s life to
   a pebble thrown into a stream — the ripples, he said, continue outward
   in every direction. His friend had simply taken a new form. “We are
   still in the process of meeting Roman,” Ustinov said. “It’s beautiful.”

The UK's National Health Service is testing out a medical chatbot as a
non-emergency helpline

   The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is trialling a medical chatbot
   as an alternative to its non-emergency helpline. The app, made by UK
   startup Babylon, asks people questions about their illnesses in a chat
   window before giving them advice — whether they should go to a doctor,
   or if the problem is likely to pass in time. According to a report from
   the Financial Times, the app will be used from the end of January for
   six months in locations across London, and will cover more than 1.2
   million residents.

   The NHS’ non-emergency helpline, 111, is different to the emergency
   service and not staffed by medical professionals. Each call to 111
   costs the NHS up to $20 and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
   The service has previously been criticized by the UK’s national health
   watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, with a report stating that calls
   to the service were too frequently abandoned, or callers given
   inappropriate advice.
   The Babylon app querying a user.

   Babylon hopes it can remedy this situation, with its artificial
   intelligence-powered chatbot handling basic enquires — triage, not
   medical diagnosis. Conversations handled by the app take a minute and a
   half on average and last for 12 back-and-forth exchanges. Babylon chief
   executive Ali Parsa told the FT that the commercial agreement between
   the NHS and the company would offer “substantial” cost savings, but
   would not give any financial specifics of the deal.

   It’s not the first partnership Babylon has established with the NHS,
   which has previously tapped the startup for its administrative skills.
   In Essex, Babylon is currently offering video consultations with
   doctors via its app to a population of around 21,500. The company says
   20 percent of patients at one surgery have used the app, and that the
   service has reduced local visits to both A&E and walk-in centers. Such
   video consultations are also available to individuals outside this
   catchment area at cost — £25 ($30) for a one-off appointment or £5 ($6)
   for a monthly subscription.

   Babylon is just one of a number of medical chatbots around the world,
   and in China, search giant Baidu has launched its own, named Melody.
   And in the UK, the NHS is experimenting with other digital services.
   Google’s AI division DeepMind has signed a number of deals with the
   national health provider, including one to create an app that alerts
   doctors about patients’ potentially dangerous medical conditions.

Baidu launches medical chatbot to help Chinese doctors diagnose patients

   An English translation of Baidu's Melody Chatbot

   Chinese search engine giant Baidu is launching a medical chatbot
   designed to make diagnosing illnesses easier. The conversational bot is
   named Melody and comes built into the company's iOS and Android Baidu
   Doctor app, which launched in China in 2015. Baidu Doctor allows users
   to contact local doctors, book appointments, and ask questions, with
   the chatbot intended to speed up this process.

   "What we found when operating Baidu Doctor is that when a patient asks
   a question, often the initial query doesn’t have enough information for
   a doctor to make the most confident decision," Andrew Ng, chief
   scientist at Baidu's Silicon Valley research center, tells The Verge.
   He says that what's needed is a conversation where the doctor narrows
   down information about the patient's symptoms. When did the headaches
   start, for example, and how long do they last; is the pain local or
   general, and so on.

   "[Melody] asks those additional questions," says Ng. "And as they're
   generated by AI, they're reactive, responding to what you've already
   said." He stresses, though, that Melody is not a replacement for
   doctors — it's merely intended to inform the advice that they offer.
   "By gathering more information for the doctor we believe it will help
   them make better diagnoses."

   The bot is powered by Baidu's deep learning and natural language
   processing systems, which the company has been investing in for years.
   The company also has the advantage of access to China's huge market of
   hundreds of millions of potential users, allowing it to access to a lot
   of data to improve its conversational skills. Currently the bot is only
   available in China, but Baidu is actively looking to explore new
   markets. "We are in discussion with healthcare services around the
   world, including Europe and the US," says Ng. "We're interested in
   helping with healthcare globally."

   A number of startups in the US and UK have launched similar apps,
   including Your.MD and Babylon Health. As with Baidu's chatbot, they use
   conversational bots to perform basic triage on patients. The apps have
   performed well in limited head-to-head comparisons with nurses, asking
   similar questions and coming to similar conclusions, but how they might
   fit into a whole country's health care system is a far more challenging
   question.

   How, for example, will such medical apps be regulated, and what happens
   if they're embraced by local governments, perhaps similar to how
   certain towns have decided to subsidize Uber instead of investing in
   public transit? And what happens to patients' data? (Ng says that while
   patient data is encrypted, all interactions with the bot are "logged.")

   Baidu's hope is that their medical AI won't supplant doctors, but just
   encourage more active health care. "There's always this debate when you
   build technology, whether it'll expand employment." says Ng. The
   invention of the automobile, for example, led to greater employment of
   taxi drivers. "But we'll see what happens with healthcare," he says,
   adding that so much change is coming to the industry as more
   information is digitized; turned into productive fodder for AI projects
   like Baidu's chatbot.
   For Baidu, it seems the focus is just on what it can deliver now. The
   company cites statistics from the World Health Organization that the
   world faces a deficit of some 13 million doctors and health care
   professionals over the next 20 years. "I think the shortage of
   healthcare providers is acute," says Ng. "We see doctors seeing huge
   numbers of patients every day — upwards of 80, 100, every day. We can
   help."
   Update October 11th, 1PM ET: Updated with additional comments from
   Andrew Ng.

   Amazon’s retail plans are growing from a single brick-and-mortar
   bookstore to a large network of pop-up shops in US malls, according to
   a report from Business Insider. These retail locations are said to be
   distinct from Amazon’s existing Seattle storefront, focusing not on
   books but on its growing number of consumer electronic devices. Those
   gadgets include the Kindle and Amazon Fire product lines, the Fire TV
   set-top box, the Dash button, and the Echo and Amazon Tap speakers.

   The company has already begun the rollout, with 21 stores located in 12
   states across the country. A new Amazon website details each of these
   locations, describing the pop-up shops as a way to ask experts about
   products, demo those products, and shop for accessories. The stores
   also serve another purpose: for every Amazon hardware product sold, the
   company gains one more way to sell Amazon products and services like
   Prime. (On the book side, the company is said to be expanding its book
   store operation from Seattle to New York City, Chicago, and Portland.)

   "Pop-up shops push people to use Amazon.com and sign up for Prime"

   A series of job listings, unearthed by Business Insider, describe these
   established pop-up shops as part of test phase that is now over. The
   listings say Amazon is ready to grow and expand the operation, and the
   report states the number of pop-up shops could exceed 30 by year’s end
   and grow to as many as 100 locations by next year. "We offer pop-up
   kiosks so that customers can try out all our new devices and learn
   about our services like Prime and unique content like Amazon
   Originals," Amazon said in a statement.

   During a shareholder meeting in May, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the
   company would be more aggressive in its retail expansion, partly as a
   way to educate itself on which sales tactics work best in offline
   environments. "We’re definitely going to open additional stores, how
   many we don’t know yet," he said. "In these early days it’s all about
   learning, rather than trying to earn a lot of revenue."

   Ikea has come out with a new line of furniture that, according to the
   company, can be assembled within just five minutes. The new Regissör
   series, announced this week, includes a coffee table, bookshelf, and
   cabinets — all of which can be put together without any tools.

   The key is a set of newly designed wooden dowels attached to the joints
   of each piece, replacing the annoying screws and locks that the company
   traditionally uses. These dowels are placed at a 45-degree angle along
   the wedged ends of each board, allowing for more natural support than
   the usual 90-degree orientation. The boards are also made of a lighter
   material, designed to lessen the stress on each corner.

   The Regissör series goes on sale this month at US Ikea locations, with
   prices ranging from $139 for the table to $349 for the cabinet.

Instagram’s latest assault on Snapchat is a messaging app called Threads

   The app promotes sharing your status, location, and more with your
   closest friends

   Facebook is developing a new messaging app called Threads that is meant
   to promote constant, intimate sharing between users and their closest
   friends, The Verge has learned. Threads, which is designed as a
   companion app to Instagram, invites users to automatically share their
   location, speed, and battery life with friends, along with more typical
   text, photo, and video messages using Instagram’s creative tools. The
   app, which is designed for sharing with your “close friends” list on
   Instagram, is now being tested internally at Facebook.

   Instagram declined to comment.

   In May, Instagram ceased work on Direct, a standalone messaging app
   that it had been developing since late 2017. At the time, executives
   said that beta testers were frustrated about having to switch between
   Instagram and a second app whenever they wanted to send a message. But
   the company has remained interested in building new messaging
   experiences, executives have said. Instagram employees who work on
   messaging were moved to the Facebook Messenger team earlier this year
   as part of a broader consolidation between the parent company and its
   prized acquisition.

   A messaging app built around your close friends might be more popular.
   That’s what Snapchat already is today for a healthy portion of its
   users. Reports have indicated that the average Snapchat user spends
   more time inside the app than the average Instagram user does. For
   Facebook and Instagram, which have long coveted Snapchat’s strong
   engagement among younger users, Threads could represent another effort
   to chip away at their rival’s appeal.

   Screenshots reviewed by The Verge show an app that’s designed to
   promote constant, automatic sharing between users and the people on
   their “close friends” list on Instagram. Opt in to automatic sharing,
   and Threads will regularly update your status, giving your friends a
   real-time view of information about your location, speed, and more. At
   the moment, Threads does not display your real-time location — instead,
   it might say something like a friend is “on the move,” according to
   sources familiar with the matter.

   You can also update your status manually, with statuses appearing in
   the main feed along with messages. It’s the latest effort to automate
   status sharing using mobile phone sensors and one-tap status sharing.
   (An app called Status tried something similar in 2014, and Danny
   Trinh’s Free app took another approach in 2015.)

   The core of Threads appears to be messaging, and it looks very similar
   to the existing messaging product inside Instagram. Messages from your
   friends appear in a central feed, with a green dot indicating which of
   your friends are currently active. If your friend has posted a story
   recently, you can view that from inside Threads as well. Threads also
   has a camera, which you can use to capture photos and videos and send
   them to your close friends.

   It’s unclear when Threads might launch. Facebook might end development
   before shipping the app to the general public, as it did with Direct.
   But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March that he sees private
   messaging as the future of the company. Threads appears to represent
   the company’s latest effort to make that vision a reality.

   Good. I was just telling myself I need a 5th messaging app to try and
   keep in contact with my friends. /s

   In all seriousness, I’m sure this will be great. The problem is that
   messaging apps have been proven to be both geographical and
   generational – most people outside of the US use Whatsapp. In the US,
   you’re kind of divided by iMessage, Snapchat (which caters to one
   generation), Facebook Messenger (another generation), Tik Tok (another,
   probably the newest generation)… It’s getting a little ridiculous these
   days.

   I’d guess that iMessage is the most popular messaging app (outside of
   basic SMS) in the United States. People of all generations use it,
   whether they realize it or not, because of how ubiquitous the iPhone is
   here. I believe around 40% market share? Young people like it for
   cultural reasons, and older people use it because it’s what comes on
   the phone.

   By RyHerbs on 08.26.19 7:35pm

   yea I agree, I think it goes SMS , then Imessage, then likely
   Messenger, then Snapchat.

   I think this new app is thinking outside the box, which is nice to see
   someone trying something slightly different.

   By Lindsey Schlabach on 08.26.19 8:56pm

   well i wouldn’t group imessage and sms with other apps since they’re
   opt-out and treated as the go to form of text communication via phone
   numbers

   By VIIIXXIX on 08.26.19 11:28pm

   Who cares. It’s what people use

   By amazingMic on 08.27.19 5:09am

   Here in the Philippines we still rely on SMS a lot, then followed by
   Facebook Messenger and Viber as the two most popular outside SMS, and
   very few users of WhatsApp, WeChat, and Telegram.

   By greenarcher02 on 08.27.19 2:42am

   Not to mention Telegram if you want to talk securely!

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:26am

   Cool! If it’s well integrated with Instagram’s chat service and
   Facebook Messenger, instead of its own separate thing, I’m into it.
   Hopefully I can get my last friend who uses Snapchat to switch over to
   Instagram like the rest of us with this app.

   Way to differentiate yourself; with features such as tracking your
   friends speed and battery life

   By Drapery on 08.26.19 10:49pm

   I do not need another level of anxiety on top of my anxiety over my own
   battery life.

   By greenarcher02 on 08.27.19 2:54am

   The battery life indicator might be a safety feature to check up on
   friends who are by themselves. And also to understand why a friend
   might not have replied to your message yet.

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:26am

   So if your friend has full battery and hasn’t replied, will you be
   messaging them "Why aren’t you replying to me, Hannah?"

   If this is a feature you want, you’ve got issues

   By Drapery on 08.27.19 5:04pm

   On one hand, yeah it can be useful for checking up on loved ones,
   especially in natural disasters. On the other, what Drapery said. "I
   know you’re on full battery why aren’t you replying?"

   By greenarcher02 on 09.05.19 11:19pm

   Good. We really needed that. Perhaps they could add an extra chat
   function to Whatsapp too.

   Crazy.

   By McJabberclackers on 08.27.19 2:44am

   No one:
   Nobody ever:
   Not even a soul:
   Facebook: Here’s a new chat app!

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:25am

   I think private networks are the future of social media and this might
   be a move towards that. Instead of just making it another messaging
   service, maybe they should focus on making this a private network to
   launch the next big platform themselves, instead of acquiring what
   becomes popular next.

   By CanChn on 08.27.19 4:27am

   This clustermess is what you get when GSM standards and practices had
   failed to enforce operators to switch to RCS on initial release back in
   2008. Cause by 2012 RCS would have become do-it-all-be-it-all for
   communication (voice, text, video, file sharing, phonebook, location
   sharing etc).

   But they didn’t. So now we are still waiting for Universal Profile
   adoption that doesn’t have one fifth of all the features that have been
   available since version 5 back in 2012.

   By Texax on 08.27.19 10:56am

   This is clearly for a younger audience that I don’t understand, because
   I have no idea why anyone would need to know or care about where I am
   at all times of the day and night. Not to mention that I don’t want
   them knowing!

   By CrabbyCrabberson on 08.27.19 10:57am

   Sounds creepy and invasive. Battery life, speed, location, wtf?!

   By SC310 on 08.27.19 11:22am

   It’s for the social media generation: Look at me, I’m standing next to
   a rock! Look at me, I’m in the bathroom! Look at me, I’m outside and
   swipe right to see a pic of me inside! Now I’m on the couch watching a
   movie with my pet gerbil!! Isn’t my life the most excitingest thing
   ever?!?
