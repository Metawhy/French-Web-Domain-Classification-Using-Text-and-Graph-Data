Born Pretty Store stamping polish #10 – orange

   Hi everyone!

   A while ago I had a few Born Pretty Store points to use up and one of
   the products I decided to get with them was an orange stamping polish.
   I really enjoy having stamping polishes in a range of colours, there
   are so many nail art opportunities! Today I decided to show you how the
   orange stamping polish (#10) performs over a dark and a light base.

   I tried it first over a dark base. I really like orange and blue
   together, so I decided to go with a dark purplish blue base and then
   stamp using the vibrant orange.

   To get this look, I started with a base of Blush Lacquers Fireflies
   Under an Indigo Sky. I then stamped using the Born Pretty Store orange
   stamping polish and plate BeautyBigBang XL-16.

   A simple but pretty look! I was very happy with how well the orange
   showed up over the darker base. Next, I tried it over a light base:

   I decided to channel a little bit of Autumn spirit in this nail art,
   using an image that looks like a tree. The white base and the bare tree
   are wintery, but I think the orange colour of the stamping pulls it
   back to Autumn just enough!

   To get this look, I started with a base of KBShimmer Up to Snow Good. I
   then stamped using Born Pretty’s orange stamping polish and plate
   BeautyBigBang XL-011.

   As you can see, it stamps beautifully! I also really like this stamping
   image, I need to use it again in a more riverine interpretation!

   If you’d like to get your hands on a bottle of this stamping polish,
   it’s available here, along with a variety of other colours!

   Painted Fingertips | Blue and green drip marble

   Hi everyone!

   It’s been a while since I’ve shared a drip marble – too long! This is
   such a fun and beautiful style of nail art. I can never get enough –
   each drip marble is so unique and if you use a good mix of polishes,
   it’ll be gorgeous.

Have a Nice Day Nails

   Painted Fingertips | Have a Nice Day - Bon Jovi album nail art

   Hi everyone!

   I am so excited to finally share this nail art with you! Back in April,
   the Digital Dozen had an ‘albums’ theme and I started doing a couple of
   nail art looks for the theme. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to take part
   in posting for that week, but I saved up the nail art I had done until
   I had a chance to post it. This look was inspired by Bon Jovi’s album
   Have a Nice Day and it is just such a fun nail art look!

   Painted Fingertips | Purple Christmas in July nail art

   Hi everyone!

   Today I have my final (late) Christmassy look for the Digital Dozen’s
   Christmas in July theme to share with you! Like my first look for the
   week, when I used pink and blue instead of red and green, I decided to
   use less Christmassy colours, but stick with seasonal imagery. I love
   purple, so I used multiple shades of purple for this look!

   Hi everyone!

   It looks like I was a bit ambitious thinking that I could handle a full
   week of posts for Digital Dozen after my long blog hiatus! I’m a bit
   late with my last couple of posts, but I’m glad I’m finally managing to
   share this nail art with you.
