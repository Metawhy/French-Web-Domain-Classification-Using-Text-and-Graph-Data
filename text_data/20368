Summer Projects

   I have been fascinated by the whimsical mystery of the fairy folk since
   I was a little girl. I remember looking for them while playing outside
   and making up tiny little fairy houses using sticks, leaves and flowers
   I would collect in my own backyard. This project is a fun activity to
   do with your…

   The weather was nice for a few days in April, uncharacteristically, and
   began the countdown to the Pacific Northwest Summer. Ahhh; the handful
   of blissful weeks that makes you fall in love with the trees again, and
   wipes the memory of the last 8 gray months. Safety Husband and I have
   been trying to be…

   Stitching up felt veggies has become my newest obsession. They’re easy
   to make, and so much fun to watch kids play with! Yesterday, I shared
   PART 1 of this tutorial where we made a garden planter box, tomatoes,
   strawberries and faux plants for them to ‘grow’ on. Today we’ll be
   making… you guessed it! More…

   Plant the seeds of joyful gardening and teach your child how to tend to
   their very own felt vegetable garden! This is a great project that can
   be turned into the ultimate garden playtime complete with a garden
   planter box, plants, and ‘pickable’ fruits and veggies. Also, don’t
   forget the play watering can! My twin…

   I’ve recently taken up the study of herbalism and have begun to create
   my own Materia Medica in the form of an artist’s book. I plan to spend
   time with each herb, watching it grow in my garden and harvesting,
   experimenting with different uses, and even learning its history and
   folk lore. Lately I’ve been…

   Whenever Rachel and I get together there is always a lot of making. We
   hang out, paint, draw, and then we party (ie: DIY TIMES). In
   anticipation for this visit, we made lists of possible crafts, and
   “Paper Marbling” appeared on both lists. Done! We’d seem several
   methods, but we had almost all the supplies to…

   I can’t remember where exactly I first discovered Four Thieves vinegar,
   but I was intrigued by its use in history and it’s legendary story.
   Myth has it that a group of thieves during the European outbreak of the
   black plague set out to rob the dead and the sick in Marseille. When
   they were caught,…

   Herb gardening has become one of my favorite hobbies and this year I’m
   growing over 25 different types of herbs! There’s nothing better than a
   backyard garden full of fragrant edible plants. Now that it’s harvest
   season I’ve been researching ways to use them. I mainly use fresh herbs
   in cooking. Last year I made…

   This article was originally posted last year over at Punk Projects. But
   because art journaling is so near to my heart, I thought I’d share it
   here on Adventures-In-Making too! I’ve been art journaling ever since I
   first discovered this book by Sabrina Ward Harrison in high school. It
   was the first time I’d ever…

   Safety Husband has been making hard apple cider for me for a couple of
   years now. He’s super crafty in his own way, and loves to dissect
   projects down to their base elements, starting with the most basic
   method and backtracking till he has done every step he can. He put
   together a very simple recipe…
