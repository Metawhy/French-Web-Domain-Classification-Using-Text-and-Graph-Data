   seguintes com Qype e Zoopla respectivamente, mas mantiveram contato e
   finalmente criaram o plano para a Adzuna em 2010 (no verso de um
   envelope num pub no centro de Londres). O site foi lançado em Abril de
   2011.

     "Zuna" significa "fartura" em várias línguas Africanas. Nós queremos

   particular applicant or site for participation in the Partner Program.

   Your obligations:
     * To ensure that your website(s) at all times comply with Adzuna's
       policies and all applicable laws, including all applicable
       requirements of the GDPR.
     * To ensure that Adzuna's job listings or any other content
       syndicated to you only appears on the agreed website(s).
     * To display the job listings on your website, app or emails to your
       users.

   Payment

   Publisher shall receive payment related to the number of clicks
   generated and revenue earned by Adzuna, on production of a suitable

   clicks: clicks from bots or foreign IPs, clicks on expired adverts,
   duplicate clicks from the same IP on the same advert. If the amount
