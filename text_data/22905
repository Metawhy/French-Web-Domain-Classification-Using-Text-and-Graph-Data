   With millions of Americans unable to find employment, working wives

   In 1930, the United States needed a miracle. Months before, the stock
   market had crashed, and the economy had begun to tank with it. As the
   Great Depression pummeled millions of American workers, Frances
   Perkins, New York’s Commissioner of Labor, warned that New York faced a
   particular threat from a surprising group: Married women with jobs.

   “The woman ‘pin-money worker’ who competes with the necessity worker is
   a menace to society, a selfish, shortsighted creature, who ought to be
   ashamed of herself,” Perkins said. “Until we have every woman in this
   community earning a living wage...I am not willing to encourage those
   who are under no economic necessities to compete with their charm and
   education, their superior advantages, against the working girl who has
   only her two hands.”

   Within two years, Perkins would go on to become Secretary of Labor in
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s cabinet. And though she is known as
   one of the architects of the New Deal, her attitudes toward working
   women were shared by many who embraced FDR’s seemingly liberal economic
   policies of relief for unemployed workers.

   Perkins wasn’t the only one who was suspicious of married women in the
   workplace. The 1930s would see a spike in policies and laws that
   discriminated against, even forbade, women to work when they were
   married. During the Great Depression, discrimination against their
   employment even became law.

   “Nine states had marriage [work ban] laws prior to the Depression,”
   writes historian historian Megan McDonald Way, “and by 1940, 26 states
   restricted married women’s employment in state government jobs.” As
   women around the country struggled to make ends meet during the
   nation’s deepest economic crisis, they became an easy scapegoat for
   people looking for someone to blame.

   By the time Perkins made her speech, the debate over working women—and
   whether women should work once they married—had been raging for
   decades. Arguments about married women’s work often centered on the
   idea of “pin money.” Originally coined to refer to the small amounts of
   money women spent on fancy items, it had become shorthand for all
   women’s work by the 20th century.

   “The revised idea of pin money,” writes Janice Traflet, “increasingly
   served as a justification for paying women (including working-class
   women) lower wages than men.” Women’s work, and their expenditures,
   were cast as inconsequential and foolish, Traflet writes, yet in
   competition with the ability of men to earn money to support their
   families.

   Family support became more important than ever after the Stock Market
   Crash of 1929. Shortly after Perkins delivered her speech in 1930, U.S.
   unemployment hit a rate of 25 percent nationally—and the question of
   whether married women should hold jobs became even more controversial.

   In fact, businesses had been banning married women from work since at
   least the 1880s. Marriage bars were designed not only to reserve
   employment opportunities for men, but to ensure that unmarried women
   without families to support were kept in the lowest paying, least
   prestigious positions. Single women most commonly held clerical and
   teaching jobs, both of which had come to be seen as “women’s work” by
   the 1930s. (Black women were subject to fewer marriage bars, but had
   little access to the jobs available to white, middle-class women at the
   time.)

   In today’s era of relatively strong workplace discrimination laws, the
   prevalence of marriage bars can seem astonishing. As Way notes,
   marriage bars were common throughout the insurance, publishing, and
   banking industries, and imposed with abandon by private firms in other
   white-collar professions. The laws and policies reflected common
   misconceptions about working women. It was assumed that women might
   work outside the home before marriage, but that they would want to
   return to the home sphere once they wed. Those middle-class married
   women who did seek employment during the Depression were often met with
   hostility.

   The arguments against married women working were personal. In
   Wisconsin, for example, lawmakers passed a resolution in 1935 stating
   that when married women with working husbands got jobs, they became the
   “calling card for disintegration of family life.” The committee added
   that "The large number of husbands and wives working for the state
   raises a serious moral question, as this committee feels that the
   practice of birth control is encouraged, and the selfishness that
   arises from the income of employment of husband and wife bids fair to
   break down civilization and a healthy atmosphere.”

   In 1932, the federal government even got involved in marriage bars.
   Section 213 of the Economy Act of 1932 included a section that required
   the government to fire one member of each married couple working in
   government. Since women’s jobs inevitably paid less than men’s, they
   largely paid the price.

   In order to prevent women from going by other names to sidestep losing
   their jobs, the federal government also began requiring women with
   federal jobs to use their husbands’ names in 1933. Some women even went
   as far as marrying men without federal jobs without telling anyone so
   that they wouldn’t be fired when their coworkers learned of their
   wedding. Though women’s groups and individual women who were banned
   from federal service rigorously protested the rule, it would stay in
   place for the rest of the Great Depression.

   Ironically, married women managed to make inroads into the labor market
   despite the discrimination they faced during the Great Depression. As
   historian Winifred D. Wandersee Bolin notes, the number of married
   women workers grew between 1920 and 1940. “The gains of the 1930s were
   not nearly as dramatic as those of earlier decades,” she wrote. “What
   is significant is that they were made at a time of great economic
   stagnation—at a time when women were under a great deal of public
   pressure to leave the labor market in order to avoid competing with men
   for the short supply of jobs.”

   Section 213 stayed in force for five years until it was repealed after
   intensive lobbying by women’s groups in 1937. The repeal represented a
   victory for its opponents. But the damage was already done: As the New
   York Times reported at the time, only 154 out of about 1,600 government
   workers who lost their jobs—most women—got their jobs back. And
   anti-woman attitudes persisted through the end of the Depression.

   In 1936, only 15 percent of respondents to a poll in Fortune Magazine
   asking “Do you believe that women should have a full-time job outside
   the home?” answered yes. “Simply fire the women who shouldn’t be
   working anyway, and hire the men,” wrote journalist Norman Cousins in
   1939. “Presto! No unemployment. No relief rolls. No depression.” His
   facetious words reflected how controversial working women were even
   after Section 213’s repeal.

   The idea of white, middle-class married women working didn’t really
   become socially acceptable until the 1940s, when World War II opened up
   a large number of essential war jobs for women. State bars and policies
   against married and working women were repealed around that time due to
   a shortage of male labor as men went to war. Women’s work threatened
   men who had long held economic power—until the nation’s power was
   threatened by absent men.
