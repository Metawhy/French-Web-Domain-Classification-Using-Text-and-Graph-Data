   Prior to coming to Johns Hopkins, Jessica was an Assistant Professor of
   Nutrition in the Institute of Human Nutrition and Department of
   Pediatrics as well as an Adjunct Associate Professor at the School of
   International Public Affairs at Columbia University in New York. She
   also served as the Senior Advisor of Nutrition Policy at the Center on
   Globalization and Sustainable Development. Before joining Columbia
   University, Jessica was the Evaluation and Monitoring Officer for the
   REACH Interagency partnership at the UN World Food Programme in Rome
   Italy. From 2010-11, Jessica was a Senior Scientist at Bioversity
   International, a Consultative Group on International Agricultural
   Research (CGIAR) center, in Rome Italy, where she led their Nutrition
   and Biodiversity program. From 2007-2010, she served as the Nutrition
   Director at the Center for Global Health and Economic Development at
   the Earth Institute, and the Nutrition Regional Advisor for East and
   Southern Africa at the Millennium Development Goal Centre at the World
   Agroforestry Centre in Kenya. Prior to joining the Earth Institute, she
   was a Program Officer for the Medical Research Program focusing on
   global health initiatives at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

   Jessica has worked as an advisor, consultant, researcher and reviewer
   for various organizations and governments including DFAT, the Global
   Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), the International Food Policy
   Research Institute (IFPRI), PATH, the Scaling Up Nutrition movement
   (SUN), the UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN), USAID, the UN
   World Food Programme (WFP), the World Bank, and the World Health
   Organization (WHO).

   With fifteen plus years of research and program experience working
   in the field in sub-Saharan Africa, South and East Asia, her area of
   expertise focuses on the multi-sectoral and system approaches to ensure
   better nutrition and diets concentrated in three areas: (1) on the
   linkages between agriculture, the environment and climate, and health
   to improve food systems and environments, diversity and quality of
   diets and nutrition outcomes (2) the importance of regaining food
   security and agriculture-based livelihoods in post-conflict regions
   through better governance and food policy and, (3) the emerging area
   of equitable, ethical, and sustainable diets and food systems. She was
   the first laureate of the Carasso Foundation’s Sustainable Diets Prize
   in 2012 for her research on sustainable food and diets for long-term
   human health.

   Jessica has a PhD in Nutrition from the University of Arizona and
   completed a Stephen I. Morse postdoctoral fellowship in Immunology in
   the Department of Molecular Medicine at Columbia University.

   The U.S. accounts for five percent of the world's population but
   consumes almost 70 percent of the total global opioid supply, creating
   an epidemic. How did we get here? In this personal talk, Berman
   Institute Research Scholar Travis Rieder recounts the often-hidden
   struggle of opioid withdrawal and reveals how doctors who prescribe
   (and overprescribe) opioids aren't equipped to eventually get people
   off the meds.

   requires balancing competing priorities, and his talk highlighted the
   ethical challenges of care delivery while offering a vision of what is
   possible by moving beyond charity and re-imagining community.
