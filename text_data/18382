                                 Who Are We?

   The Marine Optics and Remote Sensing Lab is an interdisciplinary group
   studying the interaction of solar energy with the ocean.

   Our main research activities focus on the propagation of solar energy
   in the atmosphere and ocean, and include its interaction with oceanic
   constituents and its influence on primary production.
