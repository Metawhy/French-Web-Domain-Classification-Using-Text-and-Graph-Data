   Fun place
   Written by UTILITY PORTER (Former Employee) from Paris (75) on
   September 27, 2016
   Good place to work. Overall. But if you are stedy extra you will not
   survive with only 1 day of work.
   Coworkers are very helpful but management micromanage everybody to a
   point that supervisors continuously check the employes at the dinning
   room for time.
   Pros
   Free food
   Cons
   No full time opportunity available
