Summary

   I'm a conservation biologist with a focus on the marine environment and
   island biology. Particular interests include seabirds, marine debris,
   invasive species, and globally threatened or extinct species. I make
   use of a variety of field-, lab-, and collections-based techniques,
   including stable isotopes, ICP-MS, demographic modelling, and analysis
   of population trends. I am always interested in hearing from
   prospective students or post-doctoral fellows based in the UK, or
   elsewhere, who wish to join the research group. There are a number of
   options, depending on the career stage and location of prospective lab
   members. I strongly encourage women, queer, indigenous, and other
   minority group scholars to get in touch. I support flexible working
   hours and locations. I am always interested in hearing from prospective
   students or post-doctoral fellows who have research interests in
   (marine) ornithology, conservation, islands, and pollution topics.
   Students or researchers in other fields, including the arts,
   humanities, and social sciences, are also welcome to contact me about
   potential projects around the history of the collections, particular
   collectors or ornithological figures, sustainability of plastic use, or
   other topics. For more information, see

Ocean plastic is changing the blood chemistry of seabirds

   The amount of plastic in the world's oceans is growing at an
   exponential rate.

   How this is impacting wildlife is of great concern to scientists, with
   new research suggesting that it may be having long-term health impacts
   on seabirds.

   The tropical idyll of Lord Howe Island, located 600 kilometres off the
   eastern coast of Australia, is home to a few hundred people but tens of
   thousands of seabirds.

   Despite their isolation, the birds that nest on the island are some of
   the most plastic contaminated birds in the world. Rather than feeding
   their chicks the usual diet of fish, adult flesh-footed shearwaters
   have been providing their young with shards of plastic, including
   bottle tops, pieces of Lego and biro lids.

   In some years between 80 and 90% of all chicks studied have at least
   one piece of plastic in their stomach. In one extreme case 274 pieces,
   weighing 64 grams, were found in a single bird.

   In these situations, it is almost certain that the chicks will die as
   they simply cannot get enough nutrients to survive. But what is
   happening to the other chicks that are not necessarily eating enough
   plastic to directly kill them, but still ingest small pieces, is still
   not known.

   Dr Alex Bond, the Senior Curator in Charge of Birds at the Museum, has
   been studying this population of shearwaters for almost a decade.

   'Most of the work looking at the effects of ocean plastic on wildlife
   is around aspects that involve mortality. For instance, a dead bird
   washes up and it's got plastic in it, or a whale strands and it's got
   heaps of carrier bags in it,' explains Alex.

   'But what we noticed on Lord Howe was that a lot of the seabirds we
   encountered alive also had plastic in them, and we wanted to try and
   better understand what sublethal effects that plastic ingestion might
   be having.'

A preference for plastic

   Flesh-footed shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) are a medium-sized seabird
   native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, named after their pale,
   pinkish feet. The birds breed in southern Australia and northern New
   Zealand, including on Lord Howe Island.

   Breeding in their thousands, the adults go out to hunt for fish and
   squid at night, returning to their burrows to feed the waiting chicks.
   In recent years, however, it has become apparent that on Lord Howe it
   is not only fish that the adults are providing their young with.

   For some reason, the adult shearwaters are also eating plastic.

   plastic in them, from biro lids to LEGO pieces © Alex Bond

   'The birds are mistaking it for food, but why is that?,' asks Alex. 'If
   you give corn and plastic to a two-day-old chicken it can readily
   distinguish food from non-food, so why are these shearwaters going out
   and bringing back things like bottle caps and Tetra Pak lids?

   'Ultimately we don't know.'

   What Alex and his colleagues do know is that this plastic is having
   detrimental impacts on the health of the chicks. Birds with just a
   single piece of plastic in them weigh less than those without.

   More worryingly, it also seems to making chicks' wings grow more
   slowly.

   'This can have some pretty significant consequences for a bird that has
   to fly unaided to the Sea of Japan when they leave the island,' says
   Alex.

Bloody chemistry

   In a new study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, Alex
   and his colleagues at the University of Tasmania and the Lord Howe
   Island Museum have been looking at other sublethal effects (those
   effects that are harmful but not fatal) that ingesting plastics might
   be having on these birds, including what was going on with their blood
   chemistry.

   'What was interesting was that for certain blood chemistry values we
   did find some significant effects,' explains Alex. 'For example, birds
   with plastic had higher cholesterol, they had lower dissolved calcium
   and they also tended to have more uric acid and more amylase in their
   blood.

   'We assumed that there would be some sort of sublethal effects. But for
   some of the aspects like cholesterol, we didn't think that it would
   just be the presence of plastic that would cause higher cholesterol
   compared to birds with less plastic. Just a single piece is enough.'

   understand the sublethal effect that small amounts have on the birds ©
   Alex Bond

   These are very early days, so what this actually means for the birds
   and their health is still not fully understood.

   Alex continues, 'We know that in humans high levels of cholesterol are
   bad and cause circulatory problems, but the challenge with birds is
   that no one has really thought to look at this. No one really cares
   what the cholesterol levels of a shearwater are, or what is considered
   normal and what is of concern.'

   How exactly the presence of plastic is causing these changes in the
   shearwater chicks is also unknown.

   It could be that the plastic itself is somehow directly impacting the
   birds but, as Alex explains, it could also be the bacteria and other
   microorganisms that are growing on the surface of the plastics as they
   float around the oceans.

   Put simply, it is too early to know the mechanisms behind both how it
   is impacting the birds and whether this is leading to problems for the
   birds further down the line.

An uncertain future

   Even though flesh-footed shearwaters are only considered near
   threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature,
   the future of these birds is not looking great.

   Bird Life International estimates that their populations have declined
   by up to 29% over the last three generations, a downward trend that is
   continuing.

   plastic we can help alleviate some of the problems © Mike Prince /

   One of the major concerns for the species is their accidental by-catch
   in the fishing industry, as well as rats and mice on the islands on
   which they nest and the development of coastal sites.

   The addition of plastics into this mix could, however, have more
   insidious impacts decades down the line.

   'You have to wonder how long this species can keep this up,' says Alex.
   'Plastic in the ocean is increasing exponentially and that is not an
   exaggeration, so it is not a problem that is going to get better any
   time soon. So what does that mean for the flesh-footed shearwater in
   five, ten, or twenty years’ time?

   'Plastic that is already in the ocean floats around for decades, and
   we've now had 70 years of industrial-level plastic production, so a lot
   of it is already in the world's oceans.

   'Reducing the amount of plastic that gets into the ocean is the only
   way that it is going to be sorted.'

Summary

   I'm a conservation biologist with a focus on the marine environment and
   island biology. Particular interests include seabirds, marine debris,
   invasive species, and globally threatened or extinct species. I make
   use of a variety of field-, lab-, and collections-based techniques,
   including stable isotopes, ICP-MS, demographic modelling, and analysis
   of population trends. I am always interested in hearing from
   prospective students or post-doctoral fellows based in the UK, or
   elsewhere, who wish to join the research group. There are a number of
   options, depending on the career stage and location of prospective lab
   members. I strongly encourage women, queer, indigenous, and other
   minority group scholars to get in touch. I support flexible working
   hours and locations. I am always interested in hearing from prospective
   students or post-doctoral fellows who have research interests in
   (marine) ornithology, conservation, islands, and pollution topics.
   Students or researchers in other fields, including the arts,
   humanities, and social sciences, are also welcome to contact me about
   potential projects around the history of the collections, particular
   collectors or ornithological figures, sustainability of plastic use, or
   other topics. For more information, see

Ocean plastic is changing the blood chemistry of seabirds

   By Josh Davis

   The amount of plastic in the world's oceans is growing at an
   exponential rate.

   How this is impacting wildlife is of great concern to scientists, with
   new research suggesting that it may be having long-term health impacts
   on seabirds.

   The tropical idyll of Lord Howe Island, located 600 kilometres off the
   eastern coast of Australia, is home to a few hundred people but tens of
   thousands of seabirds.

   Despite their isolation, the birds that nest on the island are some of
   the most plastic contaminated birds in the world. Rather than feeding
   their chicks the usual diet of fish, adult flesh-footed shearwaters
   have been providing their young with shards of plastic, including
   bottle tops, pieces of Lego and biro lids.

   In some years between 80 and 90% of all chicks studied have at least
   one piece of plastic in their stomach. In one extreme case 274 pieces,
   weighing 64 grams, were found in a single bird.

   In these situations, it is almost certain that the chicks will die as
   they simply cannot get enough nutrients to survive. But what is
   happening to the other chicks that are not necessarily eating enough
   plastic to directly kill them, but still ingest small pieces, is still
   not known.

   Dr Alex Bond, the Senior Curator in Charge of Birds at the Museum, has
   been studying this population of shearwaters for almost a decade.

   Bond

   'Most of the work looking at the effects of ocean plastic on wildlife
   is around aspects that involve mortality. For instance, a dead bird
   washes up and it's got plastic in it, or a whale strands and it's got
   heaps of carrier bags in it,' explains Alex.

   'But what we noticed on Lord Howe was that a lot of the seabirds we
   encountered alive also had plastic in them, and we wanted to try and
   better understand what sublethal effects that plastic ingestion might
   be having.'

A preference for plastic

   Flesh-footed shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) are a medium-sized seabird
   native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, named after their pale,
   pinkish feet. The birds breed in southern Australia and northern New
   Zealand, including on Lord Howe Island.

   Breeding in their thousands, the adults go out to hunt for fish and
   squid at night, returning to their burrows to feed the waiting chicks.
   In recent years, however, it has become apparent that on Lord Howe it
   is not only fish that the adults are providing their young with.

   For some reason, the adult shearwaters are also eating plastic.

   plastic in them, from biro lids to LEGO pieces © Alex Bond

   'The birds are mistaking it for food, but why is that?,' asks Alex. 'If
   you give corn and plastic to a two-day-old chicken it can readily
   distinguish food from non-food, so why are these shearwaters going out
   and bringing back things like bottle caps and Tetra Pak lids?

   'Ultimately we don't know.'

   What Alex and his colleagues do know is that this plastic is having
   detrimental impacts on the health of the chicks. Birds with just a
   single piece of plastic in them weigh less than those without.

   More worryingly, it also seems to making chicks' wings grow more
   slowly.

   'This can have some pretty significant consequences for a bird that has
   to fly unaided to the Sea of Japan when they leave the island,' says
   Alex.

Bloody chemistry

   In a new study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, Alex
   and his colleagues at the University of Tasmania and the Lord Howe
   Island Museum have been looking at other sublethal effects (those
   effects that are harmful but not fatal) that ingesting plastics might
   be having on these birds, including what was going on with their blood
   chemistry.

   'What was interesting was that for certain blood chemistry values we
   did find some significant effects,' explains Alex. 'For example, birds
   with plastic had higher cholesterol, they had lower dissolved calcium
   and they also tended to have more uric acid and more amylase in their
   blood.

   'We assumed that there would be some sort of sublethal effects. But for
   some of the aspects like cholesterol, we didn't think that it would
   just be the presence of plastic that would cause higher cholesterol
   compared to birds with less plastic. Just a single piece is enough.'

   While some birds consume so much plastic they die, Alex is trying to
   understand the sublethal effect that small amounts have on the birds ©
   Alex Bond

   These are very early days, so what this actually means for the birds
   and their health is still not fully understood.

   Alex continues, 'We know that in humans high levels of cholesterol are
   bad and cause circulatory problems, but the challenge with birds is
   that no one has really thought to look at this. No one really cares
   what the cholesterol levels of a shearwater are, or what is considered
   normal and what is of concern.'

   How exactly the presence of plastic is causing these changes in the
   shearwater chicks is also unknown.

   It could be that the plastic itself is somehow directly impacting the
   birds but, as Alex explains, it could also be the bacteria and other
   microorganisms that are growing on the surface of the plastics as they
   float around the oceans.

   Put simply, it is too early to know the mechanisms behind both how it
   is impacting the birds and whether this is leading to problems for the
   birds further down the line.

An uncertain future

   Even though flesh-footed shearwaters are only considered near
   threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature,
   the future of these birds is not looking great.

   Bird Life International estimates that their populations have declined
   by up to 29% over the last three generations, a downward trend that is
   continuing.

   plastic we can help alleviate some of the problems © Mike Prince /

   One of the major concerns for the species is their accidental by-catch
   in the fishing industry, as well as rats and mice on the islands on
   which they nest and the development of coastal sites.

   The addition of plastics into this mix could, however, have more
   insidious impacts decades down the line.

   'You have to wonder how long this species can keep this up,' says Alex.
   'Plastic in the ocean is increasing exponentially and that is not an
   exaggeration, so it is not a problem that is going to get better any
   time soon. So what does that mean for the flesh-footed shearwater in
   five, ten, or twenty years’ time?

   'Plastic that is already in the ocean floats around for decades, and
   we've now had 70 years of industrial-level plastic production, so a lot
   of it is already in the world's oceans.

   'Reducing the amount of plastic that gets into the ocean is the only
   way that it is going to be sorted.'
