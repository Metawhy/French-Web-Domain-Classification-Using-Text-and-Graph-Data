     RAMPS 1.4 5x Stepper motor driver mount shield for Arduino (3D)

RAMPS 1.4 5x Stepper motor driver mount shield for Arduino (3D)

   Reference ASHRAMPS14
   €15.00
   Tax included

   RepRap Arduino Mega Pololu Shield, or RAMPS for short. It is designed
   to fit the entire electronics needed for a RepRap in one small package
   for low cost. RAMPS interfaces an Arduino Mega with the powerful
   Arduino MEGA platform and has plenty room for expansion. The modular
   design includes plug in stepper drivers and extruder control
   electronics on an Arduino MEGA shield for easy service, part
   replacement, upgrade-ability and expansion. Additionally, a number of
   Arduino expansion boards can be added to the system as long as the main
   RAMPS board is kept to the top of the stack.

   Version 1.4 uses surface mount capacitors and resistors to further
   cover edge issue cases. As of version 1.3 in order to fit more stuff
   RAMPS is no longer designed for easy circuit home etching. If you want
   to etch your own PCB either get version 1.25 or Generation 7
   Electronics. Version 1.25 and earlier are "1.5 layer" designed boards
   (i.e. it's double sided board, but one of layers can easily be replaced
   with wire-jumpers) that is printable on your RepRap with the etch
   resist pen method, or home fabbed with toner transfer.

Features

     * It has provisions for the cartesian robot and extruder.
     * Expandable to control other accessories.
     * 3 mosfets for heater / fan outputs and 3 thermistor circuits.
     * Fused at 5A for additional safety and component protection
     * Heated bed control with additional 11A fuse
     * Fits 5 motor driver boards (you can find two types on the right)
     * Motor driver boards are on pin header sockets so they can be
       replaced easily or removed for use in future designs.
     * I2C and SPI pins left available for future expansion.
     * All the Mosfets are hooked into PWM pins for versatility.
     * Servo style connectors are used to connect to the endstops, motors,
       and leds. These connectors are gold plated, rated for 3A, very
       compact, and globally available.
     * USB type B receptacle
     * SD Card add on availabl
     * LEDs indicate when heater outputs on
     * Option to connect 2 motors to Z for Prusa Mendel


Voltage and current notes

   Standard RAMPS has a 5A PTC fuse that runs the Arduino Mega, the
   stepper motor drivers, and the D10 and D9 outputs. This PTC fuse is
   rated for a max of 30V, however other components on the board are rated
   for lower voltages, so care should be taken when using any voltage
   >12V.

   Standard RAMPS has a 11A PTC fuse that runs the D8 output. This PTC
   fuse is rated for a max of 16V.

   RAMPS was developed with 12V systems in mind, but it is possible to run
   it at 24V with various precautions. Most RAMPS boards will happily run
   at 13.8V or slightly higher with no modification. It is not recommended
   to exceed 15V for a standard setup, especially if you've bought your
   board from a cheaper supplier who may have used lower spec components
   than are recommended.

   Notes:
     * Some variants of RAMPS have real fuses in place of the PTC fuses
       (eg: GRRF RAMPS). The max current limits will of course be
       different.
     * Many PSU's overestimate their max current capability. The max
       current you require will depend on all your components and the
       voltage you run them at. For a standard RAMPS board, running a
       machine with a heated bed, your PSU should generate 12V at >16A
       (20+A is better, as some PSU's overestimate their capabilities).

   Rated maximum output: ± 3A, peak 3.5A.
   Working voltage DC 10V-35V. Recommended to use a switching power supply
   of DC24V.

   Logic voltage from 3V to 12V (raspberry pi, arduinos, parallel ports,
   etc).

   Using the Toshiba TB6560AHQ new original chip with low voltage
   shutdown, overheating stop and over current protection circuit to
   ensure optimal performance.
   For two-phase within 42,57 stepping 3A / four-phase / of line four /
   six-wire stepper motor, and is not suitable for more than 3A stepper
   motor. Automatic half current function.
   6N137 high-speed optical coupling, guarantee high speed without losing

EasyDriver allegro stepper motor driver

   MDREASYDRIVER
   €6.00
   The EasyDriver is a simple to use stepper motor driver, compatible with
   anything that can output a digital 0 to 5V pulse. EasyDriver requires a
   7V to 30V supply to power the motor and can power any voltage of
   stepper motor. Connect a 4-wire stepper motor and a microcontroller and
   you've got precision motor control! EasyDriver drives bi-polar motors,
   and...

   Out-of-Stock
   €7.50
   Tax included

   This product is a carrier board or breakout board for TI’s DRV8825
   stepper motor driver; we therefore recommend careful reading of the
   DRV8825 datasheet (1MB pdf) before using this product. This stepper
   motor driver lets you control one bipolar stepper motor at up to 2.2 A
   output current per coil (see the Power Dissipation Considerations
   section below for more information). Here are some of the driver’s key

     * Description
     * Product Details
     * Reviews

   Features:
     * Suitable for 8.2V~45V (between VMOT and GND for motor), and less
       than 2.2A (2A for A4988) steppers
     * Simple step and direction control interface
     * Six different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step,
       1/8-step, 1/16-step, and 1/32-step (1/16 max for A4988)
     * Adjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output
       with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your
       stepper motor’s rated voltage to achieve higher step rates
     * Intelligent chopping control that automatically selects the correct
       current decay mode (fast decay or slow decay)
     * 45 V maximum supply voltage
     * Built-in regulator (no external logic voltage supply needed)
     * Can interface directly with 3.3 V and 5 V systems
     * Over-temperature thermal shutdown, over-current shutdown, and
       under-voltage lockout
     * Short-to-ground and shorted-load protection
     * 4-layer, 2 oz copper PCB for improved heat dissipation
     * Exposed solderable ground pad below the driver IC on the bottom of
       the PCB
     * Module size, pinout, and interface match those of our A4988 stepper
       motor driver carriers in most respects.

   This product ships with all surface-mount components—including the
   DRV8825 driver IC—installed as shown in the product picture.

     A4988 stepper motor driver with heat sink (widely used for 3d
   printers and reprap)

A4988 stepper motor driver with heat sink (widely used for 3d printers and
reprap)

   Reference MDRA4988
   €7.50
   Tax included

   The A4988 stepper motor driver carrier is a breakout board for
   Allegro’s A4988 microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver. The driver
   features adjustable current limiting, overcurrent and overtemperature
   protection, and five different microstep resolutions (down to
   1/16-step). It operates from 8 – 35 V and can deliver up to
   approximately 1 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (it
   is rated for 2 A per coil with sufficient additional cooling).

     * Description
     * Product Details
     * Reviews

   This product is a carrier board or breakout board for Allegro’s A4988
   DMOS Microstepping Driver with Translator and Overcurrent Protection;
   we therefore recommend careful reading of the A4988 datasheet (380k
   pdf) before using this product. This stepper motor driver lets you
   control one bipolar stepper motor at up to 2 A output current per coil
   (see the Power Dissipation Considerations section below for more
   information). Here are some of the driver’s key features:
     * Simple step and direction control interface
     * Five different step resolutions: full-step, half-step,
       quarter-step, eighth-step, and sixteenth-step
     * Adjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output
       with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your
       stepper motor’s rated voltage to achieve higher step rates
     * Intelligent chopping control that automatically selects the correct
       current decay mode (fast decay or slow decay)
     * Over-temperature thermal shutdown, under-voltage lockout, and
       crossover-current protection
     * Short-to-ground and shorted-load protection

   This product ships with all surface-mount components—including the
   A4988 driver IC—installed as shown in the product picture.
