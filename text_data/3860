   Future, 21 Savage and fellow Atlanta rapper Big Bank Black gave back to
   their community in the funnest way possible ... AND helped everyone
   stay cool in the process.

   The rappers rented out the entire water park at Six Flags White Water
   in the ATL Wednesday, and seemingly invited everyone from their Zone 6
   neighborhood to get some relief from the summer heat at an epic "hood
   day."

   Gotta Catch 'Em All Launch Gallery goldinauctions.com

   Somebody caught 'em all ... and paid some serious coin for it!!!

   TMZ Sports has learned a complete set of Pokemon cards just fetched
   $107,010 at auction ... and it's the most cash someone has EVER plopped
   down for the famous card game!!!

   The 103 pieces are ridiculously rare ... they're all in perfect, Gem
   Mint 10 condition -- and, yes, the most coveted Pokemon card in the
   world, the 1st edition Charizard, is included.

   The holographic Alakazam, Blastoise and Chansey cards are also in the
   set -- which was sold at Goldin Auctions over the weekend -- and
   they're all in unbelievable shape considering they were made in 1999.

   In fact, we're told for some of these cards ... there are less than 50
   (!!!) in these conditions in the world!!

   Better get on the phone with Mom and check that childhood collection
   ASAP!!!

   TMZ/Getty

   Heidi Klum is a married woman, and has been for several months now ...
   TMZ has learned.

   Heidi and Tom Kaulitz essentially pulled off a secret marriage the same
   way Justin and Hailey Bieber did, but looks like they were way better
   at keeping it under wraps.

   According to a public document, the German rocker and supermodel
   obtained a marriage certificate, and sources familiar tell us they said
   their "I dos" way back in February of this year.

   [61714bcc2d014ce38bebfc1135fbd75b_md.jpg] Backgrid

   They were seen out on February 22 on what we thought was just a dinner
   date at Mr. Chow -- but now we know they were quietly celebrating
   becoming Mr. and Mrs. just a few hours earlier.

   BTW, that's a significant date for the couple -- Heidi's said they
   first met on Feb. 22, 2018.

   You'll recall ... Heidi said yes when Tom, guitarist for the band Tokio
   Hotel, popped the question back in December -- she posted a grinning
   pic of them and flaunted her engagement ring.

   [3157437f7ccc43bbbcfe8d4fd8f9e00f_md.jpg]

   This is Heidi's third marriage -- after Seal and Ric Pipino -- and
   Tom's second. He doesn't have any kids ... of course Heidi has 4 from
   her previous marriages. Welcome to stepfatherhood, Tom.

   Mazel tov!

   Bella Hadid is turning heads at breakneck speeds in Paris ... which
   tends to happen when her ass is literally hanging out on a catwalk.

   The model strutted down the runway Wednesday at Paris Fashion Week in a
   cropped blazer and sheer bodysuit -- with the most eye-catching part
   being her black briefs and butt cutouts.

   Fair to say fans of the Mugler Womenswear Spring/Summer 2020 line got
   an eyeful.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   Another cool feature in Bella's outfit ... butt-length chains that
   dangled from her hair bun. You'd think Bella's sultry outfit couldn't
   possibly be upstaged ... but you'd be dead wrong.

   Give it up for this guy who stormed down the runway in knee-high boots,
   looking like he was about to ready to open a can of whoop ass.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   20-year-old German model Leon Dame's runway stomp was so fierce he
   easily became the talk of the night ... with this video going viral.
   Derek Zoolander would be proud.

   BTW, the kid's a big deal in the modeling world -- having crushed
   runways for Gucci and Burberry, among others. Get out the way!!!

   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and his longtime girlfriend, reality TV
   star Sandra Lee, are calling it quits.

   The Governor and Sandra released a joint statement Wednesday announcing
   their split, saying, "Over the recent past, we have realized that our
   lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship
   has turned into a deep friendship."

   They continued, "We will always be family and are fully supportive of
   each other and dedicated to the girls. Our personal lives remain
   personal and there will be no further comment."

   Rumors they'd ended things were swirling earlier this year after the
   couple put their luxurious colonial mansion on the market, but Sandra
   denied a breakup at the time ... saying they just didn't need that much
   space anymore.

   Sandra and Cuomo first got together in 2005 -- 1 year before he won the
   office of New York Attorney General, and 5 years before he was elected
   Governor. Of course, her role as a de facto First Lady of New York
   wasn't just standing by her man.

   Besides her role as a de facto First Lady of the Empire State ...
   Sandra is a major personality on the Food Network and a best-selling
   author.

   They had no children together, but the Governor has 3 daughters from a
   previous marriage.

   George Clooney's just sittin' around on his ass -- alongside Brie
   Larson -- and getting paid for it ... good work if you can get it!

   The movie stars were riding through the streets of Madrid Wednesday --
   Clooney on a beautiful white donkey, and Larson on what looks like a
   white horse, of course. Although it could be a mule. Forgive us ...
   we're no equine experts.

   [b24bd15503e9437982f6f56107a9fa17_md.jpg] Mega

   Either way, they seemed to vibe well with the animals, and at one
   point, George even shared a moment with a chicken that wandered onto
   set. The actors were shooting a new ad for Nespresso. George has been
   its main spokesman since 2006.

   Over the years actors like Matt Damon, John Malkovich, Danny DeVito and
   Natalie Dormer have joined him for the spots ... and now you can add
   Captain Marvel to that list.

   Y'know what they say -- work hard, bray hard.

   If you thought Taraji P. Henson's movie, "What Men Want," was a new
   take on "What Women Want," think again -- a screenwriter says it's
   really a rip-off of his script, and now he's suing Paramount.

   Joe Carlini says he wrote a screenplay entitled "What the F Is He
   Thinking?" back in 2015, and shopped it around Hollywood -- but Joe
   admits he struck out. No one bit.

   In his lawsuit, Joe says he had meetings with reps for big-time
   production companies, including Weinstein, Montage and Bloom. He even
   spoke to several actors about starring in his movie. Yes, he dropped
   some names in the docs ... James Franco, Chris Pratt, Nick Swardson and
   King Bach.

   Still, it never took flight. Cut to 2 years later ... when, according
   to the docs, the film's producers get Taraji on board for their film.
   When it came out in 2019, Joe says it was painfully obvious, to him
   anyway, they'd jacked his script.

   Among the similarities he saw: both main characters wish they could
   understand men better ... both fall and hit their heads after partying
   ... and both wake up in the hospital and discover they can hear men's
   thoughts.

   Joe says both characters even lose the power to hear men's thoughts the
   same way -- another bump on the noggin. In his suit, Joe says they also
   ripped off his idea to have sports stars make cameos. "What Men Want"
   had Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill and Lisa Leslie. Joe says he was in
   talks to land NFL stars Terrell Owens and Cordarrelle Patterson for his
   movie.

   He's suing Paramount, BET, producer Will Packer and most of the flick's
   screenwriters for copyright infringement. Carlini points out 'WMW'
   grossed more than $72 million, and now he wants a slice of that pie.

   We've reached out to Paramount ... no word back yet.

   Porn star Bridget Powers wasted little time going on the attack when
   she caught her boyfriend with another woman -- she immediately woke him
   with a butter knife to the calf!!!

   According to the police report -- obtained by TMZ -- Bridget showed up
   to her BF Jesse's place in the wee hours of the morning and found him
   asleep with another woman. She told cops she screamed at them, grabbed
   a knife ... and stabbed Jesse in the leg.

   The other woman says she was awoken by Bridget knocking at the bedroom
   door before she busted in screaming ... "You sl*t, I knew you didn't
   love me," at Jesse.

   The woman claims she saw Bridget stab him in the leg, and when she
   tried to restrain Bridget ... she tried to stab her too but missed.
   According to the report, the other woman -- who's 5'8" -- picked up the
   porn star and threw her out of Jesse's home.

   Jesse told cops he woke up when Bridget stabbed him in the right calf,
   but he didn't really know what was happening because he was still half
   asleep.

   Cops later found a butter knife covered in blood on the kitchen floor.

   UNDER ATTACK TMZ.com

   As we reported ... the police were called because Bridget continued
   screaming at Jesse and the other woman from outside the apartment, then
   threw a large object through his front window. The report says the
   object was a barbecue grill -- and neighbors captured the grill toss on
   video.

   THE ARGUMENT TMZ.com

   There's also audio of Bridget going off on Jesse after the alleged
   stabbing, in which she drops countless vulgar insults before
   threatening ... "I will f**k you up."

   According to the police report ... Jesse told officers Bridget does not
   live with him, but they've been having sex the past 2 years.

   Bridget was booked on felony charges of domestic battery with the use
   of a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon and burglary while in
   possession of a deadly weapon. We're told prosecutors have yet to file
   charges.

Antonio Brown's Agent WR Not Retired from NFL ... 'Few Teams Interested'

   Antonio Brown is NOT done with the NFL -- despite what he said on
   social media ... this according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, who says
   he's been in talks with multiple teams.

   "I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in
   him and want to know about his future and what's going on with the
   NFL," Rosenhaus said on Warren Sapp's '99 Problems' podcast.

   "Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue
   his Hall of Fame career."

   Rosenhaus did not mention any of the interested teams by name.

   Of course, Brown swore off the NFL on Sunday morning ... just days
   after he was cut by the New England Patriots.

   "Will not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals
   do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them
   accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2
   months will see if they pay up!"

   Brown was upset at the likelihood the Patriots will not be paying him
   most of his $9 million guaranteed signing bonus. The team reportedly
   cut bait with Brown over menacing text messages he sent to a woman
   accusing him of sexual misconduct.

   The team believes they fired Brown for cause and therefore shouldn't be
   on the hook for the money. AB was reportedly set to collect a huge
   chunk of the money if he just lasted another week with the Pats.

   The issue now ... the NFL is investigating Brown over the alleged text
   messages and other issues surrounding the superstar WR, including
   allegations of violent rape.

   Multiple NFL teams now view Brown as toxic and could be scared away
   from signing him due to a possible league discipline stemming from the
   investigation. In fact, Redskins legend Joe Theismann just warned his
   former team to STAY AWAY from AB at all costs.

   Stay AWAY FROM AB TMZSports.com

   Brown says he's going back to school at his alma mater, University of
   Central Michigan -- but Rosenhaus says it's not an indicator that
   Antonio is giving up on football.

   "I know there's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that
   means he's not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college
   courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something
   that I would recommend to every client ... I wouldn't read too much
   into that."

   11:57 AM PT -- Kayla tells TMZ ... Henry's graft surgery is underway.
   She says doctors decided to move up the surgery from Thursday morning
   because they feared Henry could develop further infections due to his
   burns.

   "Gypsy Sisters" star Kayla Williams' 1-year-old grandson is on a
   ventilator in the hospital after a scalding hot bath left his skin
   covered in second-degree burns.

   Kayla tells TMZ ... the terrifying incident went down Sunday morning at
   her home in West Virginia when her grandchild, Henry, was given a bath
   by his 7-year-old stepsister. Kayla says Henry's stepsister put him in
   the tub after letting hot water run without turning on any cold water,
   and the results were horrendous.

   According to Kayla, Henry's stepsister quickly realized what she did
   and turned on the cold water, but it sent Henry into shock ... plus he
   was badly burned.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... police and paramedics responded to
   a 911 call at the home for a burn patient. Kayla says Henry was
   airlifted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland, where he's currently
   receiving treatment for his burns.

   Our law enforcement sources also say police are investigating the
   incident and working with prosecutors to determine if any charges will
   be filed, or if it was just an accident.

   Kayla says Henry is heavily sedated and on a ventilator, and he's set
   to undergo graft surgery on his foot. But, the good news is Kayla says
   Henry is expected to pull through.

   11:01 AM PT -- Kylie says she's too sick to travel overseas for the
   Balmain show at Paris Fashion Week.

   [f58e73e9280e45d8849fcb6f57cb11bc_md.jpg]

   She was set to launch her makeup collab with Olivier Rousteing, but
   unfortunately, she says her team will have to carry on without her ...
   but promises it will be an epic event.

   We're told Kris is already in Paris to oversee Kylie's Balmain
   partnership. Kris has been speaking to Kylie regularly and we're told
   she'll be flying home on Saturday to be with her.

   Kylie Jenner is suffering, and has been for several days, with an
   intense illness that required her to check into a hospital this week
   ... TMZ has learned.

   Sources familiar with the situation tell us Kylie was admitted to an
   L.A.-area hospital. One source described it as severe flu-like symptoms
   -- which included nausea and dizziness.

   [5f66f0dc8f8d49bba200bffaa4c5b72a_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told Kylie was supposed to present at the Emmys on Sunday night
   ... along with her sisters, Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner, but
   she was way too sick to make the appearance.

   As for Kylie's parents -- Kris Jenner is out of the country for work
   right now, but one source said Caitlyn Jenner's been at the hospital
   checking in on their daughter.

   We're told Kylie's getting top-notch treatment right now, but it's
   unclear what her prognosis is at this point.

   What's PC Casting? TMZ.com

   Boy George says he doesn't care if the actor who plays him in a
   forthcoming biopic is of the same sexual orientation as him or not --
   just so long as they nail the part.

   The Culture Club frontman was at Rock & Reilly's Irish Pub Tuesday
   night in WeHo, where he tackled the issue of PC casting head-on while
   talking to paps. He told one photog that casting a gay man was NOT at
   the forefront of his mind as the movie ramps up.

   BG notes they haven't cast the starring role yet, and while it's
   undecided if they'll look for an actor who is gay ... he says it's no
   biggie in his eyes.

   George goes on to make a point about equality, and it's not exactly
   what you might be used to hearing. Considering all the calls lately for
   actors to be authentic to the subjects they're playing -- in gender
   identity, ethnicity or race -- he has an interesting take.

   Boy George seems to be following ScarJo's lead, who spoke out against
   PC casting after bowing out of a film about a transgender person. The
   issue was also raised recently with Taron Egerton -- who is not gay --
   being cast as Elton John in "Rocketman."

   As far as where our boy, George, lands ... count him among the
   less-than-outraged.

   HEADED TO COURT TMZ.com

   8:38 AM PT -- June and Geno just walked outta court after facing the
   judge. Their plea hearing was set for Thursday. Sounds like we know
   what plea they'll enter ... based on what Geno shouted after exiting
   the courthouse. June, BTW, was still not in a mood to talk with anyone.

   DECLARING 'VICTORY' TMZ.com

   Mama June is finally facing the judge in her crack cocaine possession
   case in Alabama, and she made one hell of an entrance with her bf, Geno
   Doak.

   They were in no mood to talk when they marched into the Macon County
   Courthouse Wednesday morning for their arraignment on felony drug
   possession. Geno stepped out of their SUV fired up -- yelling, "What's
   up pussies? F**king queers?!!"

   Meanwhile, June was bundled up under a hood as Geno offered a hearty,
   "F**k off!" to our photog.

   [afb58331d4dc5b3b931b327588869179_md.jpg] Macon County Sheriff

   You'll recall ... the couple was busted back in March ... which, as it
   turns out, was the start of a major downhill slide for June. Since
   then, her family's held a failed intervention, trying to convince her
   to enter rehab for drug addiction and to leave Geno.

   [bf3d828683d2407fafec5bc0e95afca3_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   June refused to do either and, as a result, Honey Boo Boo is now living
   with her sister. Geno and June also sold their home -- which they left
   in a total shambles -- to begin traveling around the country in an RV.

   Interestingly, a camera crew for WE tv -- which airs June's reality
   show -- were rolling as she and Geno arrived for court.

   [4bd39de1ff4242478e03744479c13c84_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   As we reported, producers are on the fence about whether to continue
   airing the show with June's life going off the rails.

   For now, at least, it seems they're still documenting her fall.

NFL's Kyle Long Cracks Dong Jokes After Being Exposed In Bears Locker Room

   Breaking News

   Kyle Long ain't shying away from the fact that thousands of people just
   saw his junk ... in fact, the Bears offensive lineman is actually
   joking about the whole ordeal!!!

   After Chicago beat up the Washington Redskins on Monday night, Long's
   penis was accidentally exposed while teammate Tarik Cohen live streamed
   from the locker room on Instagram. Oops!!!

   Cohen took down the vid just minutes after realizing he accidentally
   exposed Long's man junk, but the damage had already been done -- Long
   was trending on social media.

   But, Kyle is taking the whole incident in stride ... he appeared on
   Barstool Sports' "Pardon My Take" -- and he and the 'PMT' guys slyly
   and hilariously joked about it.

   IFRAME:
   https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6J14rhcNSq8wbjUzmaEpV6

   Some of the highlights from Long ...

   "The D was out in numbers."

   "You would think with my large stature there'd be more, like, jumbo
   packages."

   "I had heard about a cold front coming in, and I guess I just wasn't
   prepared for it, man. Because it hit me hard right at the end of the
   game."

   The funniest joke, though??? The 'PMT' guys asked which NFL pass rusher
   is tougher to block, Bradley CHUBB or Fletcher COX ...

   "Both are tough guys. Tough matchups," Long said. "But, I'd say with
   Chubb being so far outside and Cox being right there in the middle,
   you've got to deal with Fletcher more."

   HILARIOUS!!!

   Props to Kyle for rolling with the punches ... and maybe next time wait
   'til everyone's dressed to go live, Tarik???

   Another man has been arrested in connection with Mac Miller's fatal
   overdose.

   36-year-old Lake Havasu City resident Ryan Reavis is in custody ...
   this after the FBI and DEA targeted him over Mac's death. The law
   enforcement agencies obtained a search warrant for Reavis' home, and
   what they found led to his arrest.

   According to investigators, drugs were found -- including
   prescription-only pills and marijuana. Cops say they also confiscated
   firearms, including a 9mm pistol and two shotguns, a homemade firearm
   suppressor and an arsenal of ammo.

   [d89cb6684706489a895471262c858102_md.jpg]

   Perhaps most important ... police found a physician's prescription pad.

   Reavis was arrested and booked on fraud, drug and gun charges on
   $50,000 bail.

   You'll recall ... Mac's alleged dealer, Cameron James Pettit, was
   arrested a few weeks ago for allegedly supplying Mac with deadly
   counterfeit oxy pills ... which cops say led to his death.

   [7d2dfe5cb8f64bab9e9086bb320c4bf9_md.jpg]

   In the charging docs, prosecutors said Pettit worked with two women,
   who police say also played a role in supplying Mac with drugs 2 days
   before he died.

   GOTTA DO THE TIME TMZ.com

   The Game is calling out Tekashi69 ... calling the kid's snitching
   something a fake ass gangster -- and not a real Blood -- would ever do.

   We got Game Tuesday in downtown L.A. at MedMen ... and the rapper
   unloaded on Tekashi for singing like a bird on the witness stand. Game
   confesses he actually feels sad for the kid ... because he got himself
   into a mess after claiming to be something he's really not.

   Plain and simple ... Game says Tekashi shoulda kept his mouth shut.

   [ffdc02e8a010459fb18ab32c5a78e51d_md.jpg] Elizabeth Williams

   As we reported ... Tekashi did A LOT of snitching last week, first on
   his former fellow gang members and then over a couple of high-profile
   shootings. Game, no stranger to beefing with Tekashi, also assesses
   whether 69's career will survive the rat game.

   Game, who has a weed line with MedMen dubbed "Trees by Game," also has
   an easy Tekashi Halloween costume suggestion ... actually, no costume
   required.

   TRUMP BETRAYED US! TMZ.com

   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes the case for impeaching Donald Trump
   has been mounting for awhile, but with the latest developments ...
   kicking his ass out of office is a no-brainer.

   The Congresswoman was out on Capitol Hill Tuesday after word got out
   that Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry of the
   President, and she broke down for us why the case against POTUS is so
   serious this time around.

   AOC says Trump abused his power and used foreign relations to try to
   influence the upcoming election -- a clear violation of the law -- and
   even admitted to it. In fact, a transcript of the call between Trump
   and the Ukranian President was just released, and Trump clearly asks
   the President to lean on the Ukranian Attorney General for dirt.

   She calls his actions a betrayal of the American people, and suggests
   no matter how hard the Prez tries ... there's no talking his way out of
   this one.

   (BUTTON) Play video content [1fc8d26b72e15558bd509517a1a43cc7_md.jpg]

   THIS WILL BACKFIRE TMZ.com

   It probably won't be as simple as that ... as a quick chat with Rudy
   Giuliani shows. We spoke to Trump's lawyer as well, and his take on
   impeachment is much more optimistic for 45 ... and the GOP as a whole.

   Giuliani tells us the real abuse of power is on the Democrats' side,
   and he thinks the inquiry is only going to help Trump get reelected. He
   also insists POTUS did nothing wrong, and a transcript of his call with
   the president of Ukraine will prove it.

   So, Rudy and AOC clearly disagree here, and we have a feeling they
   probably don't see eye to eye on Trump's Nobel Peace Prize chances
   either.

   There has been a very secret play by the U.S. Attorney to get more
   parents to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal, and what's
   especially interesting is that prosecutors are putting the squeeze on
   people who haven't even been charged with a crime.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, parents who hired ringleader Rick
   Singer received grand jury subpoenas recently for various documents
   that could lead to an indictment. Lawyers for the parents got in touch
   with the U.S. Attorney, who threatened to indict the parents in a
   similar fashion to Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and dozens of
   others.

   [85543df777ee450f9b06e59ddbbbfda6_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told the lawyers and prosecutors are either in the process of
   negotiating a guilty plea or have already negotiated it, even before
   any criminal charges are filed. We're told the U.S. Attorney will file
   criminal complaints and the parents will immediately plead guilty.

   It's unclear how many parents have folded under the pressure, but at
   least several have.

   And, other sources tell TMZ, a number of new indictments are coming
   down the pipeline and some involve USC. Our sources say scores of
   parents -- scores and scores -- have already lawyered up fearing
   they'll be indicted.

   Jason really loves him some pizza ... and evidently the crust too. He
   had some fun with the paps too ... bringing out an employee with him
   and pimping the joint. Sure, he flipped the bird to photogs, but in a

   Somebody caught 'em all ... and paid some serious coin for it!!!

   TMZ Sports has learned a complete set of Pokemon cards just fetched
   $107,010 at auction ... and it's the most cash someone has EVER plopped
   down for the famous card game!!!

   The 103 pieces are ridiculously rare ... they're all in perfect, Gem
   Mint 10 condition -- and, yes, the most coveted Pokemon card in the
   world, the 1st edition Charizard, is included.

   The holographic Alakazam, Blastoise and Chansey cards are also in the
   set -- which was sold at Goldin Auctions over the weekend -- and
   they're all in unbelievable shape considering they were made in 1999.

   In fact, we're told for some of these cards ... there are less than 50
   (!!!) in these conditions in the world!!

   Better get on the phone with Mom and check that childhood collection
   ASAP!!!

   TMZ/Getty

   Heidi Klum is a married woman, and has been for several months now ...
   TMZ has learned.

   Heidi and Tom Kaulitz essentially pulled off a secret marriage the same
   way Justin and Hailey Bieber did, but looks like they were way better
   at keeping it under wraps.

   According to a public document, the German rocker and supermodel
   obtained a marriage certificate, and sources familiar tell us they said
   their "I dos" way back in February of this year.

   [61714bcc2d014ce38bebfc1135fbd75b_md.jpg] Backgrid

   They were seen out on February 22 on what we thought was just a dinner
   date at Mr. Chow -- but now we know they were quietly celebrating
   becoming Mr. and Mrs. just a few hours earlier.

   BTW, that's a significant date for the couple -- Heidi's said they
   first met on Feb. 22, 2018.

   You'll recall ... Heidi said yes when Tom, guitarist for the band Tokio
   Hotel, popped the question back in December -- she posted a grinning
   pic of them and flaunted her engagement ring.

   [3157437f7ccc43bbbcfe8d4fd8f9e00f_md.jpg]

   This is Heidi's third marriage -- after Seal and Ric Pipino -- and
   Tom's second. He doesn't have any kids ... of course Heidi has 4 from
   her previous marriages. Welcome to stepfatherhood, Tom.

   Mazel tov!

   Bella Hadid is turning heads at breakneck speeds in Paris ... which
   tends to happen when her ass is literally hanging out on a catwalk.

   The model strutted down the runway Wednesday at Paris Fashion Week in a
   cropped blazer and sheer bodysuit -- with the most eye-catching part
   being her black briefs and butt cutouts.

   Fair to say fans of the Mugler Womenswear Spring/Summer 2020 line got
   an eyeful.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   Another cool feature in Bella's outfit ... butt-length chains that
   dangled from her hair bun. You'd think Bella's sultry outfit couldn't
   possibly be upstaged ... but you'd be dead wrong.

   Give it up for this guy who stormed down the runway in knee-high boots,
   looking like he was about to ready to open a can of whoop ass.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   20-year-old German model Leon Dame's runway stomp was so fierce he
   easily became the talk of the night ... with this video going viral.
   Derek Zoolander would be proud.

   BTW, the kid's a big deal in the modeling world -- having crushed
   runways for Gucci and Burberry, among others. Get out the way!!!

   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and his longtime girlfriend, reality TV
   star Sandra Lee, are calling it quits.

   The Governor and Sandra released a joint statement Wednesday announcing
   their split, saying, "Over the recent past, we have realized that our
   lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship
   has turned into a deep friendship."

   They continued, "We will always be family and are fully supportive of
   each other and dedicated to the girls. Our personal lives remain
   personal and there will be no further comment."

   Rumors they'd ended things were swirling earlier this year after the
   couple put their luxurious colonial mansion on the market, but Sandra
   denied a breakup at the time ... saying they just didn't need that much
   space anymore.

   Sandra and Cuomo first got together in 2005 -- 1 year before he won the
   office of New York Attorney General, and 5 years before he was elected
   Governor. Of course, her role as a de facto First Lady of New York
   wasn't just standing by her man.

   Besides her role as a de facto First Lady of the Empire State ...
   Sandra is a major personality on the Food Network and a best-selling
   author.

   They had no children together, but the Governor has 3 daughters from a
   previous marriage.

   George Clooney's just sittin' around on his ass -- alongside Brie
   Larson -- and getting paid for it ... good work if you can get it!

   The movie stars were riding through the streets of Madrid Wednesday --
   Clooney on a beautiful white donkey, and Larson on what looks like a
   white horse, of course. Although it could be a mule. Forgive us ...
   we're no equine experts.

   [b24bd15503e9437982f6f56107a9fa17_md.jpg] Mega

   Either way, they seemed to vibe well with the animals, and at one
   point, George even shared a moment with a chicken that wandered onto
   set. The actors were shooting a new ad for Nespresso. George has been
   its main spokesman since 2006.

   Over the years actors like Matt Damon, John Malkovich, Danny DeVito and
   Natalie Dormer have joined him for the spots ... and now you can add
   Captain Marvel to that list.

   Y'know what they say -- work hard, bray hard.

   If you thought Taraji P. Henson's movie, "What Men Want," was a new
   take on "What Women Want," think again -- a screenwriter says it's
   really a rip-off of his script, and now he's suing Paramount.

   Joe Carlini says he wrote a screenplay entitled "What the F Is He
   Thinking?" back in 2015, and shopped it around Hollywood -- but Joe
   admits he struck out. No one bit.

   In his lawsuit, Joe says he had meetings with reps for big-time
   production companies, including Weinstein, Montage and Bloom. He even
   spoke to several actors about starring in his movie. Yes, he dropped
   some names in the docs ... James Franco, Chris Pratt, Nick Swardson and
   King Bach.

   Still, it never took flight. Cut to 2 years later ... when, according
   to the docs, the film's producers get Taraji on board for their film.
   When it came out in 2019, Joe says it was painfully obvious, to him
   anyway, they'd jacked his script.

   Among the similarities he saw: both main characters wish they could
   understand men better ... both fall and hit their heads after partying
   ... and both wake up in the hospital and discover they can hear men's
   thoughts.

   Joe says both characters even lose the power to hear men's thoughts the
   same way -- another bump on the noggin. In his suit, Joe says they also
   ripped off his idea to have sports stars make cameos. "What Men Want"
   had Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill and Lisa Leslie. Joe says he was in
   talks to land NFL stars Terrell Owens and Cordarrelle Patterson for his
   movie.

   He's suing Paramount, BET, producer Will Packer and most of the flick's
   screenwriters for copyright infringement. Carlini points out 'WMW'
   grossed more than $72 million, and now he wants a slice of that pie.

   We've reached out to Paramount ... no word back yet.

   Porn star Bridget Powers wasted little time going on the attack when
   she caught her boyfriend with another woman -- she immediately woke him
   with a butter knife to the calf!!!

   According to the police report -- obtained by TMZ -- Bridget showed up
   to her BF Jesse's place in the wee hours of the morning and found him
   asleep with another woman. She told cops she screamed at them, grabbed
   a knife ... and stabbed Jesse in the leg.

   The other woman says she was awoken by Bridget knocking at the bedroom
   door before she busted in screaming ... "You sl*t, I knew you didn't
   love me," at Jesse.

   The woman claims she saw Bridget stab him in the leg, and when she
   tried to restrain Bridget ... she tried to stab her too but missed.
   According to the report, the other woman -- who's 5'8" -- picked up the
   porn star and threw her out of Jesse's home.

   Jesse told cops he woke up when Bridget stabbed him in the right calf,
   but he didn't really know what was happening because he was still half
   asleep.

   Cops later found a butter knife covered in blood on the kitchen floor.

   UNDER ATTACK TMZ.com

   As we reported ... the police were called because Bridget continued
   screaming at Jesse and the other woman from outside the apartment, then
   threw a large object through his front window. The report says the
   object was a barbecue grill -- and neighbors captured the grill toss on
   video.

   THE ARGUMENT TMZ.com

   There's also audio of Bridget going off on Jesse after the alleged
   stabbing, in which she drops countless vulgar insults before
   threatening ... "I will f**k you up."

   According to the police report ... Jesse told officers Bridget does not
   live with him, but they've been having sex the past 2 years.

   Bridget was booked on felony charges of domestic battery with the use
   of a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon and burglary while in
   possession of a deadly weapon. We're told prosecutors have yet to file
   charges.

Antonio Brown's Agent WR Not Retired from NFL ... 'Few Teams Interested'

   Antonio Brown is NOT done with the NFL -- despite what he said on
   social media ... this according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, who says
   he's been in talks with multiple teams.

   "I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in
   him and want to know about his future and what's going on with the
   NFL," Rosenhaus said on Warren Sapp's '99 Problems' podcast.

   "Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue
   his Hall of Fame career."

   Rosenhaus did not mention any of the interested teams by name.

   Of course, Brown swore off the NFL on Sunday morning ... just days
   after he was cut by the New England Patriots.

   "Will not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals
   do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them
   accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2
   months will see if they pay up!"

   Brown was upset at the likelihood the Patriots will not be paying him
   most of his $9 million guaranteed signing bonus. The team reportedly
   cut bait with Brown over menacing text messages he sent to a woman
   accusing him of sexual misconduct.

   The team believes they fired Brown for cause and therefore shouldn't be
   on the hook for the money. AB was reportedly set to collect a huge
   chunk of the money if he just lasted another week with the Pats.

   The issue now ... the NFL is investigating Brown over the alleged text
   messages and other issues surrounding the superstar WR, including
   allegations of violent rape.

   Multiple NFL teams now view Brown as toxic and could be scared away
   from signing him due to a possible league discipline stemming from the
   investigation. In fact, Redskins legend Joe Theismann just warned his
   former team to STAY AWAY from AB at all costs.

   Stay AWAY FROM AB TMZSports.com

   Brown says he's going back to school at his alma mater, University of
   Central Michigan -- but Rosenhaus says it's not an indicator that
   Antonio is giving up on football.

   "I know there's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that
   means he's not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college
   courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something
   that I would recommend to every client ... I wouldn't read too much
   into that."

   11:57 AM PT -- Kayla tells TMZ ... Henry's graft surgery is underway.
   She says doctors decided to move up the surgery from Thursday morning
   because they feared Henry could develop further infections due to his
   burns.

   "Gypsy Sisters" star Kayla Williams' 1-year-old grandson is on a
   ventilator in the hospital after a scalding hot bath left his skin
   covered in second-degree burns.

   Kayla tells TMZ ... the terrifying incident went down Sunday morning at
   her home in West Virginia when her grandchild, Henry, was given a bath
   by his 7-year-old stepsister. Kayla says Henry's stepsister put him in
   the tub after letting hot water run without turning on any cold water,
   and the results were horrendous.

   [cfdcd1c40eac4a4f8928b06507b1cfe0_md.jpg]

   According to Kayla, Henry's stepsister quickly realized what she did
   and turned on the cold water, but it sent Henry into shock ... plus he
   was badly burned.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... police and paramedics responded to
   a 911 call at the home for a burn patient. Kayla says Henry was
   airlifted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland, where he's currently
   receiving treatment for his burns.

   Our law enforcement sources also say police are investigating the
   incident and working with prosecutors to determine if any charges will
   be filed, or if it was just an accident.

   Kayla says Henry is heavily sedated and on a ventilator, and he's set
   to undergo graft surgery on his foot. But, the good news is Kayla says
   Henry is expected to pull through.

   She was set to launch her makeup collab with Olivier Rousteing, but
   unfortunately, she says her team will have to carry on without her ...
   but promises it will be an epic event.

   We're told Kris is already in Paris to oversee Kylie's Balmain
   partnership. Kris has been speaking to Kylie regularly and we're told
   she'll be flying home on Saturday to be with her.

   Kylie Jenner is suffering, and has been for several days, with an
   intense illness that required her to check into a hospital this week
   ... TMZ has learned.

   Sources familiar with the situation tell us Kylie was admitted to an
   L.A.-area hospital. One source described it as severe flu-like symptoms
   -- which included nausea and dizziness.

   [5f66f0dc8f8d49bba200bffaa4c5b72a_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told Kylie was supposed to present at the Emmys on Sunday night
   ... along with her sisters, Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner, but
   she was way too sick to make the appearance.

   As for Kylie's parents -- Kris Jenner is out of the country for work
   right now, but one source said Caitlyn Jenner's been at the hospital
   checking in on their daughter.

   We're told Kylie's getting top-notch treatment right now, but it's
   unclear what her prognosis is at this point.

   What's PC Casting? TMZ.com

   Boy George says he doesn't care if the actor who plays him in a
   forthcoming biopic is of the same sexual orientation as him or not --
   just so long as they nail the part.

   The Culture Club frontman was at Rock & Reilly's Irish Pub Tuesday
   night in WeHo, where he tackled the issue of PC casting head-on while
   talking to paps. He told one photog that casting a gay man was NOT at
   the forefront of his mind as the movie ramps up.

   BG notes they haven't cast the starring role yet, and while it's
   undecided if they'll look for an actor who is gay ... he says it's no
   biggie in his eyes.

   George goes on to make a point about equality, and it's not exactly
   what you might be used to hearing. Considering all the calls lately for
   actors to be authentic to the subjects they're playing -- in gender
   identity, ethnicity or race -- he has an interesting take.

   Boy George seems to be following ScarJo's lead, who spoke out against
   PC casting after bowing out of a film about a transgender person. The
   issue was also raised recently with Taron Egerton -- who is not gay --
   being cast as Elton John in "Rocketman."

   As far as where our boy, George, lands ... count him among the
   less-than-outraged.

   HEADED TO COURT TMZ.com

   8:38 AM PT -- June and Geno just walked outta court after facing the
   judge. Their plea hearing was set for Thursday. Sounds like we know
   what plea they'll enter ... based on what Geno shouted after exiting
   the courthouse. June, BTW, was still not in a mood to talk with anyone.

   DECLARING 'VICTORY' TMZ.com

   Mama June is finally facing the judge in her crack cocaine possession
   case in Alabama, and she made one hell of an entrance with her bf, Geno
   Doak.

   They were in no mood to talk when they marched into the Macon County
   Courthouse Wednesday morning for their arraignment on felony drug
   possession. Geno stepped out of their SUV fired up -- yelling, "What's
   up pussies? F**king queers?!!"

   Meanwhile, June was bundled up under a hood as Geno offered a hearty,
   "F**k off!" to our photog.

   [afb58331d4dc5b3b931b327588869179_md.jpg] Macon County Sheriff

   You'll recall ... the couple was busted back in March ... which, as it
   turns out, was the start of a major downhill slide for June. Since
   then, her family's held a failed intervention, trying to convince her
   to enter rehab for drug addiction and to leave Geno.

   [bf3d828683d2407fafec5bc0e95afca3_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   June refused to do either and, as a result, Honey Boo Boo is now living
   with her sister. Geno and June also sold their home -- which they left
   in a total shambles -- to begin traveling around the country in an RV.

   Interestingly, a camera crew for WE tv -- which airs June's reality
   show -- were rolling as she and Geno arrived for court.

   [4bd39de1ff4242478e03744479c13c84_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   As we reported, producers are on the fence about whether to continue
   airing the show with June's life going off the rails.

   For now, at least, it seems they're still documenting her fall.

   Kyle Long ain't shying away from the fact that thousands of people just
   saw his junk ... in fact, the Bears offensive lineman is actually
   joking about the whole ordeal!!!

   After Chicago beat up the Washington Redskins on Monday night, Long's
   penis was accidentally exposed while teammate Tarik Cohen live streamed
   from the locker room on Instagram. Oops!!!

   Cohen took down the vid just minutes after realizing he accidentally
   exposed Long's man junk, but the damage had already been done -- Long
   was trending on social media.

   But, Kyle is taking the whole incident in stride ... he appeared on
   Barstool Sports' "Pardon My Take" -- and he and the 'PMT' guys slyly
   and hilariously joked about it.

   IFRAME:
   https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6J14rhcNSq8wbjUzmaEpV6

   Some of the highlights from Long ...

   "The D was out in numbers."

   "You would think with my large stature there'd be more, like, jumbo
   packages."

   "I had heard about a cold front coming in, and I guess I just wasn't
   prepared for it, man. Because it hit me hard right at the end of the
   game."

   The funniest joke, though??? The 'PMT' guys asked which NFL pass rusher
   is tougher to block, Bradley CHUBB or Fletcher COX ...

   "Both are tough guys. Tough matchups," Long said. "But, I'd say with
   Chubb being so far outside and Cox being right there in the middle,
   you've got to deal with Fletcher more."

   HILARIOUS!!!

   Props to Kyle for rolling with the punches ... and maybe next time wait
   'til everyone's dressed to go live, Tarik???

   Another man has been arrested in connection with Mac Miller's fatal
   overdose.

   36-year-old Lake Havasu City resident Ryan Reavis is in custody ...
   this after the FBI and DEA targeted him over Mac's death. The law
   enforcement agencies obtained a search warrant for Reavis' home, and
   what they found led to his arrest.

   According to investigators, drugs were found -- including
   prescription-only pills and marijuana. Cops say they also confiscated
   firearms, including a 9mm pistol and two shotguns, a homemade firearm
   suppressor and an arsenal of ammo.

   [d89cb6684706489a895471262c858102_md.jpg]

   Perhaps most important ... police found a physician's prescription pad.

   Reavis was arrested and booked on fraud, drug and gun charges on
   $50,000 bail.

   You'll recall ... Mac's alleged dealer, Cameron James Pettit, was
   arrested a few weeks ago for allegedly supplying Mac with deadly
   counterfeit oxy pills ... which cops say led to his death.

   [7d2dfe5cb8f64bab9e9086bb320c4bf9_md.jpg]

   In the charging docs, prosecutors said Pettit worked with two women,
   who police say also played a role in supplying Mac with drugs 2 days
   before he died.

   The Game is calling out Tekashi69 ... calling the kid's snitching
   something a fake ass gangster -- and not a real Blood -- would ever do.

   We got Game Tuesday in downtown L.A. at MedMen ... and the rapper
   unloaded on Tekashi for singing like a bird on the witness stand. Game
   confesses he actually feels sad for the kid ... because he got himself
   into a mess after claiming to be something he's really not.

   Plain and simple ... Game says Tekashi shoulda kept his mouth shut.

   [ffdc02e8a010459fb18ab32c5a78e51d_md.jpg] Elizabeth Williams

   As we reported ... Tekashi did A LOT of snitching last week, first on
   his former fellow gang members and then over a couple of high-profile
   shootings. Game, no stranger to beefing with Tekashi, also assesses
   whether 69's career will survive the rat game.

   Game, who has a weed line with MedMen dubbed "Trees by Game," also has
   an easy Tekashi Halloween costume suggestion ... actually, no costume
   required.

   TRUMP BETRAYED US! TMZ.com

   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes the case for impeaching Donald Trump
   has been mounting for awhile, but with the latest developments ...
   kicking his ass out of office is a no-brainer.

   The Congresswoman was out on Capitol Hill Tuesday after word got out
   that Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry of the
   President, and she broke down for us why the case against POTUS is so
   serious this time around.

   AOC says Trump abused his power and used foreign relations to try to
   influence the upcoming election -- a clear violation of the law -- and
   even admitted to it. In fact, a transcript of the call between Trump
   and the Ukranian President was just released, and Trump clearly asks
   the President to lean on the Ukranian Attorney General for dirt.

   She calls his actions a betrayal of the American people, and suggests
   no matter how hard the Prez tries ... there's no talking his way out of
   this one.

   (BUTTON) Play video content [1fc8d26b72e15558bd509517a1a43cc7_md.jpg]

   THIS WILL BACKFIRE TMZ.com

   It probably won't be as simple as that ... as a quick chat with Rudy
   Giuliani shows. We spoke to Trump's lawyer as well, and his take on
   impeachment is much more optimistic for 45 ... and the GOP as a whole.

   Giuliani tells us the real abuse of power is on the Democrats' side,
   and he thinks the inquiry is only going to help Trump get reelected. He
   also insists POTUS did nothing wrong, and a transcript of his call with
   the president of Ukraine will prove it.

   So, Rudy and AOC clearly disagree here, and we have a feeling they
   probably don't see eye to eye on Trump's Nobel Peace Prize chances
   either.

   There has been a very secret play by the U.S. Attorney to get more
   parents to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal, and what's
   especially interesting is that prosecutors are putting the squeeze on
   people who haven't even been charged with a crime.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, parents who hired ringleader Rick
   Singer received grand jury subpoenas recently for various documents
   that could lead to an indictment. Lawyers for the parents got in touch
   with the U.S. Attorney, who threatened to indict the parents in a
   similar fashion to Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and dozens of
   others.

   [85543df777ee450f9b06e59ddbbbfda6_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told the lawyers and prosecutors are either in the process of
   negotiating a guilty plea or have already negotiated it, even before
   any criminal charges are filed. We're told the U.S. Attorney will file
   criminal complaints and the parents will immediately plead guilty.

   It's unclear how many parents have folded under the pressure, but at
   least several have.

   And, other sources tell TMZ, a number of new indictments are coming
   down the pipeline and some involve USC. Our sources say scores of
   parents -- scores and scores -- have already lawyered up fearing
   they'll be indicted.

   Bella Hadid is turning heads at breakneck speeds in Paris ... which
   tends to happen when her ass is literally hanging out on a catwalk.

   The model strutted down the runway Wednesday at Paris Fashion Week in a
   cropped blazer and sheer bodysuit -- with the most eye-catching part
   being her black briefs and butt cutouts.

   Fair to say fans of the Mugler Womenswear Spring/Summer 2020 line got
   an eyeful.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   Another cool feature in Bella's outfit ... butt-length chains that
   dangled from her hair bun. You'd think Bella's sultry outfit couldn't
   possibly be upstaged ... but you'd be dead wrong.

   Give it up for this guy who stormed down the runway in knee-high boots,
   looking like he was about to ready to open a can of whoop ass.

   Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

   20-year-old German model Leon Dame's runway stomp was so fierce he
   easily became the talk of the night ... with this video going viral.
   Derek Zoolander would be proud.

   BTW, the kid's a big deal in the modeling world -- having crushed
   runways for Gucci and Burberry, among others. Get out the way!!!

   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and his longtime girlfriend, reality TV
   star Sandra Lee, are calling it quits.

   The Governor and Sandra released a joint statement Wednesday announcing
   their split, saying, "Over the recent past, we have realized that our
   lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship
   has turned into a deep friendship."

   They continued, "We will always be family and are fully supportive of
   each other and dedicated to the girls. Our personal lives remain
   personal and there will be no further comment."

   Rumors they'd ended things were swirling earlier this year after the
   couple put their luxurious colonial mansion on the market, but Sandra
   denied a breakup at the time ... saying they just didn't need that much
   space anymore.

   Sandra and Cuomo first got together in 2005 -- 1 year before he won the
   office of New York Attorney General, and 5 years before he was elected
   Governor. Of course, her role as a de facto First Lady of New York
   wasn't just standing by her man.

   Besides her role as a de facto First Lady of the Empire State ...
   Sandra is a major personality on the Food Network and a best-selling
   author.

   They had no children together, but the Governor has 3 daughters from a

   George Clooney's just sittin' around on his ass -- alongside Brie
   Larson -- and getting paid for it ... good work if you can get it!

   The movie stars were riding through the streets of Madrid Wednesday --
   Clooney on a beautiful white donkey, and Larson on what looks like a
   white horse, of course. Although it could be a mule. Forgive us ...
   we're no equine experts.

   Either way, they seemed to vibe well with the animals, and at one
   point, George even shared a moment with a chicken that wandered onto
   set. The actors were shooting a new ad for Nespresso. George has been
   its main spokesman since 2006.

   Over the years actors like Matt Damon, John Malkovich, Danny DeVito and
   Natalie Dormer have joined him for the spots ... and now you can add
   Captain Marvel to that list.

   Y'know what they say -- work hard, bray hard.

   If you thought Taraji P. Henson's movie, "What Men Want," was a new
   take on "What Women Want," think again -- a screenwriter says it's
   really a rip-off of his script, and now he's suing Paramount.

   Joe Carlini says he wrote a screenplay entitled "What the F Is He
   Thinking?" back in 2015, and shopped it around Hollywood -- but Joe
   admits he struck out. No one bit.

   In his lawsuit, Joe says he had meetings with reps for big-time
   production companies, including Weinstein, Montage and Bloom. He even
   spoke to several actors about starring in his movie. Yes, he dropped
   some names in the docs ... James Franco, Chris Pratt, Nick Swardson and
   King Bach.

   Still, it never took flight. Cut to 2 years later ... when, according
   to the docs, the film's producers get Taraji on board for their film.
   When it came out in 2019, Joe says it was painfully obvious, to him
   anyway, they'd jacked his script.

   Among the similarities he saw: both main characters wish they could
   understand men better ... both fall and hit their heads after partying
   ... and both wake up in the hospital and discover they can hear men's
   thoughts.

   Joe says both characters even lose the power to hear men's thoughts the
   same way -- another bump on the noggin. In his suit, Joe says they also
   ripped off his idea to have sports stars make cameos. "What Men Want"
   had Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill and Lisa Leslie. Joe says he was in
   talks to land NFL stars Terrell Owens and Cordarrelle Patterson for his
   movie.

   He's suing Paramount, BET, producer Will Packer and most of the flick's
   screenwriters for copyright infringement. Carlini points out 'WMW'
   grossed more than $72 million, and now he wants a slice of that pie.

   We've reached out to Paramount ... no word back yet.

   Porn star Bridget Powers wasted little time going on the attack when
   she caught her boyfriend with another woman -- she immediately woke him
   with a butter knife to the calf!!!

   According to the police report -- obtained by TMZ -- Bridget showed up
   to her BF Jesse's place in the wee hours of the morning and found him
   asleep with another woman. She told cops she screamed at them, grabbed
   a knife ... and stabbed Jesse in the leg.

   The other woman says she was awoken by Bridget knocking at the bedroom
   door before she busted in screaming ... "You sl*t, I knew you didn't
   love me," at Jesse.

   The woman claims she saw Bridget stab him in the leg, and when she
   tried to restrain Bridget ... she tried to stab her too but missed.
   According to the report, the other woman -- who's 5'8" -- picked up the
   porn star and threw her out of Jesse's home.

   Jesse told cops he woke up when Bridget stabbed him in the right calf,
   but he didn't really know what was happening because he was still half
   asleep.

   Cops later found a butter knife covered in blood on the kitchen floor.

   UNDER ATTACK TMZ.com

   As we reported ... the police were called because Bridget continued
   screaming at Jesse and the other woman from outside the apartment, then
   threw a large object through his front window. The report says the
   object was a barbecue grill -- and neighbors captured the grill toss on
   video.

   THE ARGUMENT TMZ.com

   There's also audio of Bridget going off on Jesse after the alleged
   stabbing, in which she drops countless vulgar insults before
   threatening ... "I will f**k you up."

   According to the police report ... Jesse told officers Bridget does not
   live with him, but they've been having sex the past 2 years.

   Bridget was booked on felony charges of domestic battery with the use
   of a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon and burglary while in
   possession of a deadly weapon. We're told prosecutors have yet to file
   charges.

Antonio Brown's Agent WR Not Retired from NFL ... 'Few Teams Interested'

   Antonio Brown is NOT done with the NFL -- despite what he said on
   social media ... this according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, who says
   he's been in talks with multiple teams.

   "I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in
   him and want to know about his future and what's going on with the
   NFL," Rosenhaus said on Warren Sapp's '99 Problems' podcast.

   "Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue
   his Hall of Fame career."

   Rosenhaus did not mention any of the interested teams by name.

   Of course, Brown swore off the NFL on Sunday morning ... just days
   after he was cut by the New England Patriots.

   "Will not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals
   do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them
   accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2
   months will see if they pay up!"

   Brown was upset at the likelihood the Patriots will not be paying him
   most of his $9 million guaranteed signing bonus. The team reportedly
   cut bait with Brown over menacing text messages he sent to a woman
   accusing him of sexual misconduct.

   The team believes they fired Brown for cause and therefore shouldn't be
   on the hook for the money. AB was reportedly set to collect a huge
   chunk of the money if he just lasted another week with the Pats.

   The issue now ... the NFL is investigating Brown over the alleged text
   messages and other issues surrounding the superstar WR, including
   allegations of violent rape.

   Multiple NFL teams now view Brown as toxic and could be scared away
   from signing him due to a possible league discipline stemming from the
   investigation. In fact, Redskins legend Joe Theismann just warned his
   former team to STAY AWAY from AB at all costs.

   Stay AWAY FROM AB TMZSports.com

   Brown says he's going back to school at his alma mater, University of
   Central Michigan -- but Rosenhaus says it's not an indicator that
   Antonio is giving up on football.

   "I know there's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not that
   means he's not going to proceed with the NFL but taking online college
   courses to get your degree or your post-graduate degree is something
   that I would recommend to every client ... I wouldn't read too much
   into that."

   11:57 AM PT -- Kayla tells TMZ ... Henry's graft surgery is underway.
   She says doctors decided to move up the surgery from Thursday morning
   because they feared Henry could develop further infections due to his
   burns.

   "Gypsy Sisters" star Kayla Williams' 1-year-old grandson is on a
   ventilator in the hospital after a scalding hot bath left his skin
   covered in second-degree burns.

   Kayla tells TMZ ... the terrifying incident went down Sunday morning at
   her home in West Virginia when her grandchild, Henry, was given a bath
   by his 7-year-old stepsister. Kayla says Henry's stepsister put him in
   the tub after letting hot water run without turning on any cold water,
   and the results were horrendous.

   [cfdcd1c40eac4a4f8928b06507b1cfe0_md.jpg]

   According to Kayla, Henry's stepsister quickly realized what she did
   and turned on the cold water, but it sent Henry into shock ... plus he
   was badly burned.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... police and paramedics responded to
   a 911 call at the home for a burn patient. Kayla says Henry was
   airlifted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland, where he's currently
   receiving treatment for his burns.

   Our law enforcement sources also say police are investigating the
   incident and working with prosecutors to determine if any charges will
   be filed, or if it was just an accident.

   Kayla says Henry is heavily sedated and on a ventilator, and he's set
   to undergo graft surgery on his foot. But, the good news is Kayla says
   Henry is expected to pull through.

   11:01 AM PT -- Kylie says she's too sick to travel overseas for the
   Balmain show at Paris Fashion Week.

   [f58e73e9280e45d8849fcb6f57cb11bc_md.jpg]

   She was set to launch her makeup collab with Olivier Rousteing, but
   unfortunately, she says her team will have to carry on without her ...
   but promises it will be an epic event.

   We're told Kris is already in Paris to oversee Kylie's Balmain
   partnership. Kris has been speaking to Kylie regularly and we're told
   she'll be flying home on Saturday to be with her.

   Kylie Jenner is suffering, and has been for several days, with an
   intense illness that required her to check into a hospital this week
   ... TMZ has learned.

   Sources familiar with the situation tell us Kylie was admitted to an
   L.A.-area hospital. One source described it as severe flu-like symptoms
   -- which included nausea and dizziness.

   [5f66f0dc8f8d49bba200bffaa4c5b72a_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told Kylie was supposed to present at the Emmys on Sunday night
   ... along with her sisters, Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner, but
   she was way too sick to make the appearance.

   As for Kylie's parents -- Kris Jenner is out of the country for work
   right now, but one source said Caitlyn Jenner's been at the hospital
   checking in on their daughter.

   We're told Kylie's getting top-notch treatment right now, but it's
   unclear what her prognosis is at this point.

   What's PC Casting? TMZ.com

   Boy George says he doesn't care if the actor who plays him in a
   forthcoming biopic is of the same sexual orientation as him or not --
   just so long as they nail the part.

   The Culture Club frontman was at Rock & Reilly's Irish Pub Tuesday
   night in WeHo, where he tackled the issue of PC casting head-on while
   talking to paps. He told one photog that casting a gay man was NOT at
   the forefront of his mind as the movie ramps up.

   BG notes they haven't cast the starring role yet, and while it's
   undecided if they'll look for an actor who is gay ... he says it's no
   biggie in his eyes.

   George goes on to make a point about equality, and it's not exactly
   what you might be used to hearing. Considering all the calls lately for
   actors to be authentic to the subjects they're playing -- in gender
   identity, ethnicity or race -- he has an interesting take.

   Boy George seems to be following ScarJo's lead, who spoke out against
   PC casting after bowing out of a film about a transgender person. The
   issue was also raised recently with Taron Egerton -- who is not gay --
   being cast as Elton John in "Rocketman."

   As far as where our boy, George, lands ... count him among the
   less-than-outraged.

   8:38 AM PT -- June and Geno just walked outta court after facing the

   DECLARING 'VICTORY' TMZ.com

   Mama June is finally facing the judge in her crack cocaine possession
   case in Alabama, and she made one hell of an entrance with her bf, Geno
   Doak.

   They were in no mood to talk when they marched into the Macon County
   Courthouse Wednesday morning for their arraignment on felony drug
   possession. Geno stepped out of their SUV fired up -- yelling, "What's
   up pussies? F**king queers?!!"

   Meanwhile, June was bundled up under a hood as Geno offered a hearty,
   "F**k off!" to our photog.

   [afb58331d4dc5b3b931b327588869179_md.jpg] Macon County Sheriff

   You'll recall ... the couple was busted back in March ... which, as it
   turns out, was the start of a major downhill slide for June. Since
   then, her family's held a failed intervention, trying to convince her
   to enter rehab for drug addiction and to leave Geno.

   [bf3d828683d2407fafec5bc0e95afca3_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   June refused to do either and, as a result, Honey Boo Boo is now living
   with her sister. Geno and June also sold their home -- which they left
   in a total shambles -- to begin traveling around the country in an RV.

   Interestingly, a camera crew for WE tv -- which airs June's reality
   show -- were rolling as she and Geno arrived for court.

   [4bd39de1ff4242478e03744479c13c84_md.jpg] TMZ.com

   As we reported, producers are on the fence about whether to continue
   airing the show with June's life going off the rails.

   For now, at least, it seems they're still documenting her fall.

   Breaking News

   Kyle Long ain't shying away from the fact that thousands of people just
   saw his junk ... in fact, the Bears offensive lineman is actually
   joking about the whole ordeal!!!

   After Chicago beat up the Washington Redskins on Monday night, Long's
   penis was accidentally exposed while teammate Tarik Cohen live streamed
   from the locker room on Instagram. Oops!!!

   Cohen took down the vid just minutes after realizing he accidentally
   exposed Long's man junk, but the damage had already been done -- Long
   was trending on social media.

   But, Kyle is taking the whole incident in stride ... he appeared on
   Barstool Sports' "Pardon My Take" -- and he and the 'PMT' guys slyly
   and hilariously joked about it.

   IFRAME:
   https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6J14rhcNSq8wbjUzmaEpV6

   Some of the highlights from Long ...

   "The D was out in numbers."

   "You would think with my large stature there'd be more, like, jumbo
   packages."

   "I had heard about a cold front coming in, and I guess I just wasn't
   prepared for it, man. Because it hit me hard right at the end of the
   game."

   The funniest joke, though??? The 'PMT' guys asked which NFL pass rusher
   is tougher to block, Bradley CHUBB or Fletcher COX ...

   "Both are tough guys. Tough matchups," Long said. "But, I'd say with
   Chubb being so far outside and Cox being right there in the middle,
   you've got to deal with Fletcher more."

   HILARIOUS!!!

   Props to Kyle for rolling with the punches ... and maybe next time wait
   'til everyone's dressed to go live, Tarik???

   Another man has been arrested in connection with Mac Miller's fatal
   overdose.

   36-year-old Lake Havasu City resident Ryan Reavis is in custody ...
   this after the FBI and DEA targeted him over Mac's death. The law
   enforcement agencies obtained a search warrant for Reavis' home, and
   what they found led to his arrest.

   According to investigators, drugs were found -- including
   prescription-only pills and marijuana. Cops say they also confiscated
   firearms, including a 9mm pistol and two shotguns, a homemade firearm
   suppressor and an arsenal of ammo.

   [d89cb6684706489a895471262c858102_md.jpg]

   Perhaps most important ... police found a physician's prescription pad.

   Reavis was arrested and booked on fraud, drug and gun charges on
   $50,000 bail.

   You'll recall ... Mac's alleged dealer, Cameron James Pettit, was
   arrested a few weeks ago for allegedly supplying Mac with deadly
   counterfeit oxy pills ... which cops say led to his death.

   [7d2dfe5cb8f64bab9e9086bb320c4bf9_md.jpg]

   In the charging docs, prosecutors said Pettit worked with two women,
   who police say also played a role in supplying Mac with drugs 2 days
   before he died.

   GOTTA DO THE TIME TMZ.com

   The Game is calling out Tekashi69 ... calling the kid's snitching
   something a fake ass gangster -- and not a real Blood -- would ever do.

   We got Game Tuesday in downtown L.A. at MedMen ... and the rapper
   unloaded on Tekashi for singing like a bird on the witness stand. Game
   confesses he actually feels sad for the kid ... because he got himself
   into a mess after claiming to be something he's really not.

   Plain and simple ... Game says Tekashi shoulda kept his mouth shut.

   [ffdc02e8a010459fb18ab32c5a78e51d_md.jpg] Elizabeth Williams

   As we reported ... Tekashi did A LOT of snitching last week, first on
   his former fellow gang members and then over a couple of high-profile
   shootings. Game, no stranger to beefing with Tekashi, also assesses
   whether 69's career will survive the rat game.

   Game, who has a weed line with MedMen dubbed "Trees by Game," also has
   an easy Tekashi Halloween costume suggestion ... actually, no costume
   required.

   TRUMP BETRAYED US! TMZ.com

   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes the case for impeaching Donald Trump
   has been mounting for awhile, but with the latest developments ...
   kicking his ass out of office is a no-brainer.

   The Congresswoman was out on Capitol Hill Tuesday after word got out
   that Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry of the
   President, and she broke down for us why the case against POTUS is so
   serious this time around.

   AOC says Trump abused his power and used foreign relations to try to
   influence the upcoming election -- a clear violation of the law -- and
   even admitted to it. In fact, a transcript of the call between Trump
   and the Ukranian President was just released, and Trump clearly asks
   the President to lean on the Ukranian Attorney General for dirt.

   She calls his actions a betrayal of the American people, and suggests
   no matter how hard the Prez tries ... there's no talking his way out of
   this one.

   THIS WILL BACKFIRE TMZ.com

   It probably won't be as simple as that ... as a quick chat with Rudy
   Giuliani shows. We spoke to Trump's lawyer as well, and his take on
   impeachment is much more optimistic for 45 ... and the GOP as a whole.

   Giuliani tells us the real abuse of power is on the Democrats' side,
   and he thinks the inquiry is only going to help Trump get reelected. He
   also insists POTUS did nothing wrong, and a transcript of his call with
   the president of Ukraine will prove it.

   So, Rudy and AOC clearly disagree here, and we have a feeling they
   probably don't see eye to eye on Trump's Nobel Peace Prize chances
   either.

College Admissions Scandal Parents Agree to Plead Guilty ... Even Before
Charges are Filed

   Exclusive

   There has been a very secret play by the U.S. Attorney to get more
   parents to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal, and what's
   especially interesting is that prosecutors are putting the squeeze on
   people who haven't even been charged with a crime.

   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, parents who hired ringleader Rick
   Singer received grand jury subpoenas recently for various documents
   that could lead to an indictment. Lawyers for the parents got in touch
   with the U.S. Attorney, who threatened to indict the parents in a
   similar fashion to Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and dozens of
   others.

   [85543df777ee450f9b06e59ddbbbfda6_md.jpg] Getty

   We're told the lawyers and prosecutors are either in the process of
   negotiating a guilty plea or have already negotiated it, even before
   any criminal charges are filed. We're told the U.S. Attorney will file
   criminal complaints and the parents will immediately plead guilty.

   It's unclear how many parents have folded under the pressure, but at
   least several have.

   And, other sources tell TMZ, a number of new indictments are coming
   down the pipeline and some involve USC. Our sources say scores of
   parents -- scores and scores -- have already lawyered up fearing
   they'll be indicted.

   PIZZ-AMORE! BACKGRID

   Jason Momoa's got a lesson on Dad Bod 101 ... eat, and eat a lot!!!

   "Aquaman" had one helluva lunch Tuesday afternoon hitting up a couple
   of joints in WeHo. Jason first hit up a sushi spot, which begs the
   question ... is that considered cannibalism? Anyway, he later hit up
   Joe's Pizza for a few slices.

   Jason really loves him some pizza ... and evidently the crust too. He
   had some fun with the paps too ... bringing out an employee with him
   and pimping the joint. Sure, he flipped the bird to photogs, but in a
   playful way ... and they all ate it up.

   Dad bod or not ... Momoa always leaves ya wanting for mo'a.
