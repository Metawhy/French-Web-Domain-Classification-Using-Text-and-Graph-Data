   [character-mo.png]

                                     Mo

                           Genuine and fun-loving

   If you are down to chill while also working to promote the brand of
   your crew, you’ve got a friend in Mo. He never takes himself too
   seriously, but will always step up for his friends and what he really
   believes in.
   [character-hart.png]

                                    Hart

                     A loyal friend & chill to the bone

   While her words are few, Hart always knows exactly what to say. New to
   Dance Central, Hart is guarded, but open to finding the right crew.
   Beneath her many layers, Hart is empathetic and kind. She would never
   turn down anyone looking for fun and friendship.
   [character-emilia.png]

                                   Emilia

                        Sporty, fun, never backs down

   The best friend you’ll ever have. She’s always up for a challenge and
   will be by your side every step of the way. If you need a pep talk or
   some pointers, look no further. Together, you are unstoppable.
   [character-aubrey.png]

                                 Miss Aubrey

                      Observant & Devastatingly Honest

   If you always want to be in the know, Aubrey’s your best friend. Take
   her advice, and you will make it into any social circle you wish. Don’t
   take it, and you’ll probably be in social exile for like, forever.
   [character-oblio.png]

                                    Oblio

                            Mysterious & Fervent.

   Oblio wants to express himself through his art, but struggles to be
   understood. A creature of the night that brings enlightenment to the
   darkest of corners. Caged in his past but working to take flight… like
   a bird. A bird of the night.
