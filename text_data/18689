Meet Angelica

   Angelica Duncan is a Cheerleader of Women for ladies who are
   Kingdom-focused and purpose-driven, by their calling in business and
   leadership.

   Through her invitingly-witty blog posts, TV show, and on-demand
   classes, she’s here to encourage, equip, and empower you to build a
   spirit-filled business you love and lead with Kingdom purpose.

   When she’s not helping ladies to strategize their next move, lead with
   grace, and build strong families, she’s baking up sweets in her kitchen
   (Pinterest is her muse), dancing the night away, birthing her next
   brain-child, cheering on the Lakers, and indulging in something
   dripping with chocolate. Welcome to the Alabaster Box of
   ShepreLeadership!
