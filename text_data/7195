Plain-English Privacy Policy

   Welcome to Zapier! Here on the left you'll find our plain-english
   privacy policy and the corresponding legal policy on the right.

   We last updated this policy on January 22, 2018.

   Onward!

Legal Privacy Policy

   Date of Last Revision: January 22, 2018

   Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Zapier, Inc. ( "Zapier", "we",
   "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Zapier and has been
   created to provide information about our company and its content and
   data linking platform and related services (together with the Site, the
   "Service(s)") to our Service visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy
   Policy sets forth Zapier's policy with respect to information including
   personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information
   that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.

   PrivacyTrust Privacy Shield Certification: Click to Verify

Third-Party Service Integration

   To use Zapier, we need to store credentials for third-party services
   (Gmail, Basecamp, etc). We store credentials encrypted in our database.
   They are only used to access data you tell us to. We log certain
   non-identifiable information to provide support and fix problems.

   Our Service allows you to integrate and create commands for various
   online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). In order to take
   advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for
   or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites
   of their respective providers. When you enable linking between or log
   in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect
   relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that
   Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that
   Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials"). We store your Login
   Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.

   When you enable the Service to link content and data between
   Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with
   access to certain information that you may have provided to the
   Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such
   information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules you
   set to govern the linking. However, please remember that the manner in
   which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is
   governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Zapier shall
   have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other
   actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the
   Service.

   We may retain certain personally non-identifiable information related
   to the data or content linked between Third-Party Services (for
   example, date sent, link configuration, names of the Third-Party
   Services), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described
   below in the "Non-Identifiable Data" section.

Third-Party Payment Processor

   We use a third party payment processor, Stripe, for all payments.
   Zapier does not store credit card details and instead relies on Stripe
   for this.

   We use a third party payment processor to process payments made to us.
   In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain
   any personally identifiable information or any financial information
   such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided
   directly to our third party processor, Stripe, whose use of your
   personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be
   viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.

Information We Collect

   We ask for certain information like your name, email address, timezone,
   and account credentials to use Zapier. We use this information to run
   Zapier and other things mentioned in this Privacy policy (like logging
   and analytics).

   For your convenience, we use cookies so you don't have to log in every
   time you visit our website.

   When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal
   Data and other information from you, as further described below:
   Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect
   Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information,
   such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our
   surveys, register for access to the Zapier Services or use certain
   Zapier Services. Wherever Zapier collects Personal Data we make an
   effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. You can choose at any
   time to opt out by contacting support at contact@zapier.com, you can
   also contact us to opt out of your information being used for purposes
   other than it was originally collected.

   By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to
   our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide
   Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such
   Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the
   offices and servers of Zapier and the authorized third parties referred
   to herein located in the United States. The Personal Information that
   you provide can be accessed at any time through your account or you can
   contact our customer support at contact@zapier.com if you need help
   accessing your account.
   Cookies: In operating the Services, we may use a technology called
   "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that
   hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services.
   Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and
   help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our
   Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the
   Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more
   than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use
   cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission.
   On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar.
   Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
   notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn
   cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they
   allow you to take advantage of some of the Services's features.
   Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and
   serve the users of the Zapier Services, Zapier often conducts research
   on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the
   Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may
   be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Zapier may share
   this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.
   This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Zapier may
   also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
   services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
   third parties for other lawful purposes.

   We will keep any information that you provide to us until such time as
   you delete your account with the Zapier Service.

Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information

   Zapier won't sell or rent your personal information to a third party.
   Primarily, we use personal data to run Zapier. We may use personal data
   to provide you with predictions about other services you might be
   interested in on Zapier. If we intend to use your personal data in a
   way we have not mentioned, we will let you know when we collect that
   information.

   Sometimes we aggregate user data anonymously to understand our customer
   base better.

   Zapier will not sell or rent to any third party any of the personal
   information or data that you provide to us. Zapier uses the Personal
   Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
   Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use
   the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was
   provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the
   Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your
   problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access
   to the Zapier Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you
   with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
   Zapier and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Zapier Related
   Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally
   non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us
   improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better
   understand our users and to improve the Zapier Services. Zapier and its
   affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to
   tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do
   so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting
   you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at
   any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish
   to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as
   indicated below.

   If Zapier intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not
   consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such
   anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is
   collected.

Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information

   We don't sell your personal data. If we work with partners or
   contractors, they may have limited access to your personal data but
   only so much to do their job.

   If we sell the company, personal data may be included in the transfer.

   You can visit the Services without providing any Personal Data. If you
   choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use
   certain Zapier Services.

   Zapier is not in the business of selling your information. We consider
   this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There
   are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
   Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set
   forth below:
   Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
   businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
   reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part
   of the transferred assets. In cases of onward transfer of personal
   information to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals
   received pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, Zapier
   remains liable. Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data
   with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy
   Policy. Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Zapier, like
   many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain
   business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing
   information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we
   employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only
   provide them with the information that they need to perform their
   specific function. Legal Requirements: Zapier may disclose your
   Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
   that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation,
   (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Zapier, (iii) act in
   urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the
   Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

EU-U.S. & Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield

   Zapier is EU-U.S. & Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield compliant.

   Zapier complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department
   of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
   information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the
   United States. Zapier has certified to the Department of Commerce that
   it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. Zapier is subject to the
   investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission
   (FTC). If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy
   policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles
   shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to
   view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

   In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Zapier commits to
   resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal
   information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints
   regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Zapier at:
   contact@zapier.com.

   Zapier has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield
   complaints to PrivacyTrust, an alternative dispute resolution provider
   located in the United Kingdom. If you do not receive timely
   acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed
   your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact Communications
   House, 26 York Street, London, W1U 6PZ for more information or to file
   a complaint. The services of Communications House are provided at no
   cost to you.

   Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss
   individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding
   arbitration mechanism.

   In cases of onward transfer of personal information to third parties of
   data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-U.S. and
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, Zapier remains liable.

Exclusions

   This privacy policy only applies to private information we collect. If
   you post information in a public place, like our support forums, this
   is public information and can be shared and reproduced. Similarly, if
   you join a Zapier team account, certain of your personal information
   may be available to the team account holder and other team members.

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by
   Zapier other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This
   Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you
   provide to Zapier through the Services or through any other means. This
   includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas
   of the Services, such as bulletin boards (collectively, "Public
   Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing
   products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited
   Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be
   non-confidential and Zapier shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose,
   and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without
   limitation or attribution.

   If you are invited to join a Zapier team account, and you accept the
   invitation, you are agreeing that certain of your information will be
   shared with the team account holder and other team members. In
   particular, the team account holder will have access to your name,
   email address, avatar (if any) and task usage, and other team members
   will have access to your name, email address and avatar (if any). Any
   information you share via a team account, including Zaps you create or
   Third-Party Services you link to, will be available to all team members
   of the team account you have joined. You are solely responsible for any
   information you share via a team account, which is posted at your own
   risk.

Children

   You must be 13 years old to use Zapier.

   Zapier does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the
   age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any
   Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal
   guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
   enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to
   provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you
   have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
   Personal Data to Zapier through the Services, please contact us, and we
   will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

Links to Other Web Sites

   We link to a lot of third-party websites. Our privacy policy only
   governs our own website.

   This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may
   contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Zapier
   (the "Third-Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described
   here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. The links from the Services
   do not imply that Zapier endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party
   Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on
   their privacy policies.

Security

   We take many steps to ensure your private information and account
   credentials are safe, including encryption and requiring two-factor
   authentication for our staff. To this end, if you find a security
   problem, contact us and we will fix it immediately. Keep in mind,
   emails and communications with us are not encrypted.

   Zapier takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via
   the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission
   is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or
   from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special
   care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep
   this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Zapier via the
   Internet.

Changes to Zapier's Privacy Policy

   If anything changes, we will let you know at least 14 days ahead of
   time via this website or an email.

   The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a
   result, at times it may be necessary for Zapier to make changes to this
   Privacy Policy. Zapier reserves the right to update or modify this
   Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. If we do this, we
   will post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will
   indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last
   revised. We will also notify you, either through the Service user
   interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means.
   Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you
   provide any Personal Data. Any such changes will become effective no
   earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that
   changes addressing new functions of the Service or changes made for
   legal reasons will be effective immediately. This Privacy Policy was
   last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the
   Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes
   your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
