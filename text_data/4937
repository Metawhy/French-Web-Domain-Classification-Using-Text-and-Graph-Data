New Meta-Analysis of Hundreds of Studies: Nature Boosts Children’s Learning
in Eight Ways

   nature boosts children learning

   A large metastudy of hundreds of scientific studies has found what most
   parents and teachers already know — nature has a powerfully positive
   impact on children’s learning and on their emotional health.

   “Report after report – from independent observers as well as
   participants themselves – indicate shifts in perseverance, problem
   solving, critical thinking, leadership, teamwork, and resilience,” the
   authors wrote.  “The evidence here is particularly strong, including
   experimental evidence; evidence across a wide range of samples and
   instructional approaches; outcomes such as standardized test scores and
   graduation rates; and evidence for specific explanatory mechanisms and
   active ingredients.”

   The meta-analysis (a study that combined the results of many other
   studies) was published last month in the journal Frontiers in
   Psychology.  After combining all of the findings, the researchers found
   that nature helps children learn in eight different ways.

   The eight key ways that nature helps children learn were:

Nature Rejuvenates Kids and Helps Them Focus

   Studies showed that whether it was students going on field trips,
   Swedish preschoolers, children in Chicago public housing, or 5 to
   18-year-olds with ADHD, nature had a rejuvenating effect on attention.
   These findings were confirmed not just by parent and teacher ratings,
   but by neurocognitive tests.

Nature Relieves Stress

   The studies showed that even seeing nature out the classroom window had
   a positive effect on kids, lowering their heart rates and leading to
   kids who reported lower stress levels.  Better yet were the kids who
   were able to learn in a forest setting once a week.  Those kids had
   lower cortisol (stress hormone) levels even beyond what could be
   attributed to the physical activity of being outdoors.

Contact With Nature Boosts Self-Discipline

   Studies from Spain to inner city Chicago showed that kids who spent
   time in nature had better impulse control, including kids with ADHD and
   learning disabilities.  Contact with animals such as horses was found
   to also have a positive effect.

Student Motivation, Enjoyment, and Engagement Are Better in Natural Settings

   Many of the studies found that students and teachers reported
   strikingly high levels of student engagement and motivation, not just
   in nature activities that kids had chosen to take part in but also in
   mandatory school activities in nature.  The researchers noted that
   learning in and around nature was associated with intrinsic motivation
   and not just extrinsic motivation (meaning kids were motivated to do
   things themselves and not doing them because they were forced to),
   which is important in keeping kids engaged and interested in learning.

   “The positivity of learning in nature seem to ripple outward, as seen
   in learners’ engagement in subsequent, indoor lessons, ratings of
   course curriculum, materials, and resources and interest in school in
   general, as well as lower levels of chronic absenteeism,” the authors
   wrote.

   The researchers also found that “learning in nature may improve
   motivation most in those students who are least motivated in
   traditional classrooms.”

Time Outdoors Is Tied to Higher Levels of Physical Activity and Fitness

   Children’s time outdoors was linked to cardiorespiratory fitness, the
   type of fitness most clearly associated with better academic
   performances.  Studies also showed that kids who had access to nature
   stayed more active, even into adulthood.

Natural Settings Provide Calmer, Quieter, Safer Contexts for Learning

   The researchers found that both formal and informal learning improved
   in nature.  When they were learning in a natural setting, kids were
   less likely to engage in disruptive behaviors like pushing each other
   or talking out of turn.  “Further, in greener learning environments,
   students who previously experienced difficulties in traditional
   classrooms are better able to remove themselves from conflicts and
   demonstrate better self-control,” the authors noted.

Natural Settings Foster Friendlier, More Cooperative Relations

   Many of the studies showed that natural settings helped kids make
   friends and feel more trusting.  The researchers theorized that the
   kids were able to engage more with each other, and that they had a
   better spirit of cooperation not just with each other but with their
   teachers.  In addition, they reported that “learning in greener
   settings has been consistently tied to the bridging of both
   socio-cultural differences and interpersonal barriers (e.g.,
   personality conflicts) that can interfere with group functioning in the
   classroom.”

Natural Settings Encourages “Loose Parts” Play, Independence and Healthier
Forms of Play

   The benefits of “loose parts” play (play involving small objects that
   kids can use to play and create in open-ended ways) are extended into
   nature, where kids have access to sticks, rocks, water, dirt and other
   natural materials.  Studies have shown that teachers and principals
   found that kids who engaged in loose parts play in nature had more
   physically active, social and creative play, which were likely to lead
   to improvements in social, emotional and academic development.

   Some of the most interesting studies included:
     * One study of over 3,000 students found that kids who took part in a
       classroom garden learned more than those on the wait list.  The
       more garden time they had, the more they learned.
     * Several studies showed that having nature around schools led to
       better standardized test scores, even in schools with high poverty
       levels.
     * Many studies showed that time in “wilderness” led to kids
       developing better leadership skills, resilience, self-confidence,
       cooperation, perseverance, critical thinking and more.
     * Greener everyday environments seemed to buffer kids from stress and
       give them better coping skills.

   The authors noted that even small doses of nature helped kids, like
   being able to see nature out their classroom windows.  Obviously, the
   more time they spent in nature, the better, though.  They wrote:

     “Even small exposures to nature are beneficial. If you’re indoors,
     having a view of your yard as opposed to facing the wall, that makes
     a difference. At the same time, more is better. That’s one of the
     things that gives us more confidence that we’re seeing a real
     cause-and-effect relationship,” Kuo says. “The bigger the dose of
     nature we give a person, the bigger the effect we see in them.”

   Looking for some inspiration to get your kids outside?  I’ve been
   publishing a free nature-based monthly magazine for kids and their
   grown ups this year — Wild Kids Magazine.  You and your kiddos can read
   it online or print it out. It’s a nonprofit project (just as this blog
   always has been), just to try to do my little bit to spread good stuff
   in the world.

   wild kids collage

   Want to help convince your school to incorporate more nature in its
   learning?  These organizations may be able to help.

   Natural Start Alliance works to connect parents, teachers, day care
   providers and others who teach kids “with the tools they need to create
   great educational experiences that help young children explore the
   natural world, understand their environment, and build lifelong skills
   that will help keep them active and engaged in their communities.”

   The Children & Nature Network encourages and supports the people and
   organizations working to reconnect every child in every community with
   nature. The network provides a critical link between researchers,
   individuals, educators and organizations dedicated to children’s health
   and well-being. C&NN also provides resources for sharing information,
   strategic initiatives and success stories.

   I’ve also created a list of my favorite nature-based books for families
   (and those I can’t wait to read) on Goodreads, from The Wild Weather
   Book to How to Grow a School Garden.  Please add your favorites!

   “Must we always teach our children with books? Let them look at the
   stars and the mountains above. Let them look at the waters and the
   trees and flowers on Earth. Then they will begin to think, and to think
   is the beginning of a real education.”

   –David Polis

   Here’s to more nature goodness for all of us.

Oodles of Nutcracker Kids’ Crafts!

   nutcracker-kids-crafts

   Miss Fiona and her daddy have a tradition this time of year of watching
   The Nutcracker and reading picture books about nutcrackers.  Daryl also
   has a collection of nutcrackers that the kids love to play with.

   Last week, Fiona asked me if she could spend her money on a nutcracker
   for daddy.  The nutcracker in question was overpriced and badly made,
   so I offered to help her make him a nutcracker instead.  She loved the
   idea and I was on the hunt for some fun and easy nutcracker crafts.

Here are the best that I found, in case your kiddos would like to make some
nutcrackers of their own.

   Sophie World has this easy printable nutcracker that kids color and
   then glue to a toilet paper tube.  Add embellishments like buttons,
   feathers, pompoms and even a toothpick sword if you like.  It’s a bit
   tricky to find the PDF — click on “stats” to find it.

   Nutcracker-toilet tube roll

   Learn Create Love has a printable nutcracker that kids can color and
   then cut out and assemble.

   nutcracker printable

   Playground Park Bench has a rather elaborate Nutcracker and mouse
   battle tic tac toe game made of clothespins that you can make with the
   kids.  I’m not sure we need to buy all the parts and do it that fancy,
   but I’m thinking we could use some clothespins and craft supplies
   around the house to make our own kid versions.

   Schooling a Monkey shows how to make cute little craft stick nutcracker
   characters.

   Nutcracker-Craft-popsicle-stick

   Crafty Morning uses popsicle sticks, paper and clothespins to make some
   very cute kid-made nutcrackers.

   nutcracker-christmas-craft-for-kids

   Glued to My Crafts has a sweet paper plate nutcracker for kids to
   craft.

   Fireflies and Mudpies shows how to make a toy soldier ornament with
   craft sticks and paint.

   And I am in love with these darling nutcracker portraits shared on
   smArt Class.

   She also shared this video to show kids how to draw their own
   nutcrackers.

   Deviant Art’s CyberDrone has a printable nutcracker cube kids can have
   fun assembling, too.

   Lastly, Mom Junction has an assortment of Nutcracker themed coloring
   pages to print out for the kids to color.

10 Ways to Make Today Magical

Happy Monday!

   It’s been too long since I’ve popped in and I’m once again resolving to
   find a way to do so more regularly.

   So let’s start by getting back to some ways to make the day more
   magical.  🙂

Here are 10 ways to make a little magic this week…

   1. Go on a nature scavenger hunt.  I have a free fall nature scavenger
   hunt printable page here that you can use, or you can make up your own.

   October nature find

   2.  Make a leaf crown!  All you need are some pretty leaves (nothing
   else!) and about five minutes to make a gorgeous leaf crown.  Here’s a
   short video showing how to do it.

   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   3.  Teach your child how to make a favorite recipe.  Even little kids
   can learn to make simple things like sandwiches, and big kids love to
   learn how to cook fancier dishes.

   4.  Go see a free presentation.  Local libraries, museums, schools and
   other community centers tend to sponsor all kinds of free talks on
   everything from butterflies to meteor showers to prohibition.  See if
   you can find some upcoming talks that your kids would be interested in
   and go learn something new together.

   5.  Make up some homemade instant hot cocoa mix.  I shared our basic
   recipe in the Instagram post below. You can adapt the formula to make
   it vegan, sugar free or otherwise meet your dietary needs and
   preferences (chime in if you have a favorite paleo version!).  Adjust
   the proportions until you find the proper ratio for your tastes and
   then you have your own personal hot cocoa mix that the kids can mix up
   when they want to warm up with something sweet.

   View this post on Instagram

   Instant hot cocoa mix — powdered milk (dairy or non), cocoa and sugar
   (powdered or regular). Use proportions you like (I do about 2 parts
   milk, 1 part cocoa, 1 1/2 parts sugar) and shake to mix. Add about 2
   heaping TBS to a mug of boiling water, or to taste. Add mini
   marshmallows if you like.

   6.  Help your child start a collection.  Kids love to collect things —
   any things!  Some of our kids’ favorite collections over the years have
   been rocks, artist trading cards, bugs and bottle caps (Jack’s favorite
   collection).  You can even collect non-physical things, like types of
   clouds you’ve spotted (check out The Cloud Collector’s Handbook for a
   great book for doing that!).

   bottle caps

   7.  Have some fun with photo apps.  We created this fun picture of Alex
   with the free Photo Labs app.  Or just open up Snapchat and take some
   fun selfies together.  Print out and frame your favorite, if you like.

   8.  Leaf a message.  Use pretty leaves to write sweet or silly messages
   outside and see who will wander onto them!

   9.  Make some marbleized fall leaves.  Even if you don’t have fall
   leaves where you live (or not right now), you can make some gorgeous
   ones with your kiddos.  Apartment Therapy tells you how to use shaving
   cream, acrylic paint and watercolor paper to make these pretty leaves.

   marbelized leaves

   10. Have an early morning picnic and watch the sunrise together.  Get
   up a little early and grab something simple like muffins and a thermos
   of hot tea and go sit and watch the sunrise together.  You can watch
   from the back yard, your balcony, the roof of your apartment, a local
   park, or even pulled over in the car in a pretty area on your way to
   work and school.  Take some time to just talk and soak in the beauty.

   And with that, my pretties, I’m off to find some food for a hungry
   little girl and try to wrestle my house in order.

   Have a magical week!

Shrunken Apple Heads!

   Here’s a fun little science and nature craft just in time for
   Halloween.  The kids and I made shrunken apple heads this month and
   it’s been great fun watching them change over time.

   shrunken apple heads

   All you need are some apples (we used imperfect ones off a generous
   neighbor’s tree), salt and lemon juice.

   First peel your apples.  You can leave a little on the top and bottom
   like a little hat and scarf.

   Then give your child some carving tools (a chopstick, grapefruit spoon
   or pen knife all work well, depending on your child’s age and skill
   level with tools).  You can trace your design first with a pen or
   pencil, if you like.

   Carve out a face, making sure to make each feature large since they
   will shrink up and collapse somewhat.

   shrunken apple head

   Then mix up some salt and lemon juice and apply it all over, especially
   in the parts you’ve carved out.  This will prevent mold and also
   protect them from getting too brown.  If you like, you can talk to the
   kids about how salt has been used for thousands of years to preserve
   foods and other things, and how acids like lemon juice slow oxidation
   (browning caused by a chemical reaction when substances react with
   oxygen).

   preserving shrunken apple head

   Now just put your apple heads somewhere to dry.  Choose a location
   where you can watch them and keep up with how they change.

   Have fun!

Make a Daisy Chain or Flower Crown!

   Do you know how to make a daisy chain or flower crown?  It’s incredibly
   easy and so fun!

   There are several classic ways to make a flower crown:  the slit stem,
   braided, and woven.  Here are the simple instructions to do all three.

Method #1 — Split stem

   dandelion-crown
    1. Trim flower stems to about 4 inches. Use a fingernail to make a
       small slit in the bottom half of each stem.
    2. Thread one stem through the slit in the next, creating a chain.
       Continue, adding flowers to reach desired length. To form a circle
       or crown, make a second slit in the stem of the first flower, and
       slip the last flower through it.

   If you like visuals, here’s a quick video that shows the split stem
   method of making a daisy chain.

   https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8hu4fBdrCo?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

Method #2 — Braided

   This method makes a more tightly knit flower crown or daisy chain, and
   is a bit more durable.  Simply braid three stems together for about an
   inch, and then add in more flowers to the braid.

   how to make daisy chain crowns

   Creative Green Living has a lovely step-by-step tutorial with lots of
   photos.


Method #3 — Woven

   daisy chain

   This is another easy way to make a flower crown.  Simply wrap one stem
   around the flower of the next, pull both stems to the side, and add
   another.  Wrap that stem around the first two, pull all three stems to
   the side, and continue.  As stems end, they will be woven into the line
   well enough to stay put.  To finish, wrap the last flower around the
   first flower and the end of the chain, forming a circle.

   And here’s a short video that shows the woven method of making a flower
   crown.

   Our Annalee (Rhiannon Lee, known these days as Rhia) also made a simple
   rose crown years ago and shared the instructions here on Magical
   Childhood.

10 Ways to Make Today Magical

   Happy Monday!  I can’t wait to get back to yapping with you all again
   (if anybody is still out there!).

   I’m sorry to be gone so long this time.  Life has only gotten busier
   since I started Magical Childhood nearly 18 years ago in 2000 (and
   later this blog instead of the emailed newsletter, in 2009).  Back
   then, I had a baby girl and a toddler, who are now both officially
   grown ups  — Rhiannon (Annalee) is now 18 and Victoria is 20 years
   old!  Luckily, I still have little ones too.  Fiona is now 6, Alex just
   turned 11 and Jack just turned 15.  My hands are full but my heart is
   happy, and I love having all different ages of kiddos to play with
   now.  🙂

   I’ll start updating you all with some of the happenings here in our
   family, but in the meantime how about an old fashioned list of ways to
   make the day magical?

Here are 10 ways to make some magic this week!

   1.  Make mud art!  Find a good place to dig in the dirt and provide
   some water, spoons, platters and pretties to decorate with (dried
   flower petals, dried beans, dragon tears, beads, etc.).  Let the kids
   mix up mud and make whatever designs they like and leave them to dry.
   Take pictures and then just rinse and reuse the special stuff later.

   mud art

   2.  Drape some blankets over a clothesline, tree, tent poles or other
   props in the back yard and make some impromptu forts.  Stock the
   insides with some fun books, games, snacks, a flashlight, whatever, and
   see what fun the kids dream up to have in their new fun space.

   pirate

   3.  Use clean sand castle molds to an make ice cream castle.  Decorate
   wildly and eat!

   4.  Teach the kids how to play marbles.  This is such a simple way to
   have fun at any age.  Here are the instructions if you’ve forgotten (or
   never learned!).

   marbles

   5.  Put birthday candles in each child’s dinner tonight.  It doesn’t
   matter if dinner is sandwiches and it’s 9 months from their birthdays,
   kids just love blowing out candles and feeling special. Relight them
   and do it again and again!

   6.  Make paper boats and sail them in puddles or the kiddie pool.

   7. Make some fairy wands.  This is a simple craft we’ve been doing for
   years.  Simply attach some colorful ribbons to sticks and you’re good
   to go.

   ribbonwands

   8.  Have a bubble relay outside.  Players blow or carry their bubbles
   from person to person and start over if they pop.  Alternately, blow a
   bubble and see if you can work as a team to blow it across a finish
   line.

   9.  Go for a walk in the rain with your child.  Umbrellas optional.

   puddlesboots

   10. Have a family “3” challenge. See if each of you can do three sweet
   things today for each other family member today.  They can be tiny
   little things, just something to show you love them, things that you
   know will make them happy.  Make your teenager’s favorite dish for
   supper.  Leave the dishes and go read a story to your toddler.  Give
   extra monkey hugs (in our family, we dip kids upside down and holler
   “monkey hug!” and swing them back up again and again), and so on.

   Have a magical week!
