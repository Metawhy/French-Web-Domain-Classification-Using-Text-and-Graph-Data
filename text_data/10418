Fifth Grade Metal Repousse

   metal2


   Fifth Grade created these mixed media projects using metal tooling foil
   and metallic markers on black paper for the mat.  Students had to use
   components of composition and good design in the planning stages.
   Metal repousse and chasing  is a metalworking technique in which the
   metal is  shaped by using tools from the top and reverse side to create
   a design in low relief. The students were encouraged to create a lot of
   texture in their piece.

Picasso’s Three Musicians (minus two)

   Picasso

   By Wylie Mc Bride

   Inspired by Picasso’s Three Musicians, First graders created collages
   using construction paper scraps and some hand painted papers.  Students
   focused on shapes and creating a face with free form shapes.  They
   loved making a music stand and drawing the music on it too.

   Students chose a variety of musical instruments.  We had guitars,
   flutes, horns and many other instruments.

   mitten

   Kindergarten has been working on using pattern in an artwork and
   learning warm and cool colors.  The result?  Warm colored mittens
   covered in a zentangle-ish pattern and backgrounds painted in cool
   colors, using plastic wrap to create an icy texture.

   Enjoy these paintings by Hallie and Zach.

Summer Fun: Liquid Sidewalk Chalk

   Posted on June 22, 2012 by Wilder Paint Splatters

   Try this fun recipe from Smashed Peas and Carrots:

   http://smashedpeasandcarrots.blogspot.com/2009/09/liquid-sidewalk-chalk
   .html
   Liquid Sidewalk Chalk
   1 cup water
   1 cup cornstarch
   food coloring (any colors you desire!!)
   Mix the water and cornstarch together until combined. I then separate
   the mixture into cupcake tins or those smaller plastic cups you find in
   the paper products aisle of Target or Wal-Mart. Then, get our your food
   coloring and add a few drops to each tin or cup and mix well. As a side
   note, for all of you that only have the basic red, yellow, and blue on
   hand, you can mix ’em up for some more color choices:
   yellow + red = orange
   red + blue = purple
   blue + yellow = green
   ****and don’t forget just the basic white you already made!****

CD Weavings

   Posted on April 11, 2012 by Wilder Paint Splatters
   5


   Just a quick photo of our fourth grade weavings.  I had been given (and
   kept!) many old CD’s.  This was the perfect lesson for them.  I used a
   lesson based on one from sallgood’s Make It… a Wonderful Life blog.
   She has a wonderful tutorial.  Here is our version.

   Students who finished early learned to sew beads onto the weaving to
   give it more textural interest.

   Enjoy these weavings from Mila, Zoe and my demo.
