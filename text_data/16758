2. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY

   2.1 We place advertisements on websites operated by our client
   publishers (i.e. through our Network). Our products include Vibrant
   In-Text Ads, Vibrant In-Image Ads and Vibrant Display Ads. For more
   information about our products, click here. Other than serving
   advertisements as referred to above, we do not modify, control or
   influence any content on our client publishers’ websites.

   2.2 Our technology is designed primarily to facilitate the delivery of
   contextual advertising. For example, we may place advertisements
   triggered from highlighted keywords within the text of web content on a
   client publisher’s website so that when you move your mouse over a word
   or phrase of interest, a relevant advertisement will appear (for
   example, an advertisement for cars which appears when you move your
   mouse over the word ‘car’ while reading an automotive news article).

   2.3 We may collect information about a visitor’s interactions with the
   advertising we place on the Network, which we may use to provide more
   relevant advertisements aligned with your current interests. This
   process is called “Interest Matching”, and examples of how we may carry
   out Interest Matching are set out below:

   2.3.1 One example is that, if you interact with one of our
   advertisements (for example, by hovering your mouse over one of the
   keywords we have underscored), we may use information about your
   interaction using cookies and other technologies (please see our Cookie
   Statement for more details) and draw inferences from your visit in
   order to provide you with an advertisement that is more relevant,
   interesting, and useful for you.

   2.3.2 As another example, we may use our technology to identify a
   visitor’s interests by gathering web viewing data (e.g. web pages
   visited, browser type, referring URL, Internet service provider, a
   computer’s or device’s operating system, and date and time of visits)
   using cookies and other technologies (please see our Cookie
   Statement for more details).

   2.3.3 We may also engage in behavioural retargeting that allows us and
   some of our advertising partners to display advertising to you when you
   are on a website in our Network, based on your browsing patterns and
   interactions with a website (which may or may not be part of our
   Network). For example, if you have visited the website of an online
   retailer, you may see ads on websites in our Network from that same
   retailer displaying the products that you were viewing on the
   retailer’s website.

   2.3.4 In the case of all the examples above, the information collected
   and used does not include such personally identifiable information as
   your name, street address, e-mail address or telephone number.

   2.4 Aggregate and non-personally identifiable web viewing and computer
   data is also collected and used for other purposes including
   advertisement delivery and reporting, measuring the effectiveness of a
   campaign, optimizing a campaign, and for operational purposes. We may
   also combine web viewing data with information (e.g. demographic data)
   provided by other entities to help make our advertiser clients’
   advertising more relevant.

   2.5 If you’d like to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect your
   information for Interest Matching advertising as described in section
   2.3 of this Privacy Policy, please see our Cookie Statement. When you
   opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out
   cookie tells us not to collect your information to tailor our online
   advertisement campaigns. However, we may continue to collect certain
   data for basic ad serving and other purposes such as counting the
   number of times a keyword has been clicked.

   2.6 Our legal bases for collecting and using this personal data are as
   follows: (a) consent – we will not place cookies on your browser if you
   do not give us consent to do so. You will continue to receive
   advertising through our technology but such advertising will be only
   contextual which means that it is being placed where you can see it
   based only on the words or images on the page of the website you are
   viewing. (b) legitimate interests including our interests in providing,
   improving, and customizing our technology for our clients and customers
   and providing you with relevant advertising and content, unless those
   interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights
   requiring protection of personal information.

   2.7 We process data primarily in the European Economic Area. However,
   we are a global company and occasionally will transfer data outside the
   EEA. In such instances, the data is pseudo-anonymised so that no data
   can be tied back to any user.

   In addition, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the
   European Commission and may rely on the European Commission’s decisions
   about the adequacy of safeguards in certain countries, as applicable,
   including for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and
   other countries. You can contact us to request a copy of our Standard
   Contractual Clauses.

   3.1.2 to a third party or successor entity in connection with a
   corporate merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of
   Vibrant’s assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.

   3.1.3 if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal
   information in order to comply with any legal obligation and/or in
   order to enforce or apply any other agreements between you and Vibrant;
   or

   3.1.4 to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users.

   3.2 In addition to the information that we collect, a number of third
   parties may collect certain data when you visit websites using our
   technology. These third parties include:

   3.2.1 our website publisher clients that operate websites that use our
   technology, who may use their own cookies and other technologies to
   collect information about the content of the sites that you visit and
   the advertising that appears on those sites; and

   3.2.2 our advertiser clients that use our services to service
   advertising content, who may use cookies and other technologies within
   their advertising content to collect information about your use of the
   relevant websites and advertising

   particular, the use of the Ad Choices icon. In support of the EDAA and
   to provide consumers with enhanced transparency, we display the Ad
   Choices Icon advertisements delivered across our network to help
   consumers understand how their data is being used and provides choices
   for consumers who want more control. The Ad Choices icon is customarily
   displayed within the frame of our advertisement. The Ad Choices icon
   provides information (and links to other information) on online ads,
   who may be collecting and using online data, and how you can exercise
   choice with respect to those companies participating in the EDAA
   program. Vibrant Media also (1) is a member of the Internet Advertising
