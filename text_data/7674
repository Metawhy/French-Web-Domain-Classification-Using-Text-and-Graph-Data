   Fourteen thousand people think Keanu Reeves might be depressed. And
   with reason  the man hasn't had a hit movie in years, and his entire
   acting career can be summed up in one word: Whoa. So when a paparazzi
   photo surfaced on the Internet featuring an unshaven, mopey Reeves
   eating a sandwich on a park bench, fans started to worry. Was he sad?
   Lonely? Bored? Was something actually wrong, or was he just tired? The
   Internet, as tends to happen, became very concerned.

   Did I say concerned? I meant obsessed. The park-bench photo spread
   everywhere: on gossip sites, on message boards  it even got its own
   Tumblr blog. People left more than 200,000 comments on the website
   Reddit.com. Web illustrators Photoshopped Reeves into other sad
   settings: next to Forrest Gump, surrounded by cats, on the Lost island,
   in a Lady Gaga video, even next to Stalin and Churchill. Nothing they
   did seemed to make the actor happy. But maybe this will: Tuesday, June
   15, is Cheer Up Keanu Day.
   (See "Keanu Reeves: The Man Who Isn't There.")

   "I'm sure he's doing fine," says Daniel Murphy, 21, who created the
   Cheer Up Keanu Facebook page to advertise the new holiday. "I don't
   really think he's that sad; I just think his work is underappreciated."
   Murphy and some of the 14,000-plus people who joined the Facebook group
   believe that Reeves' acting is overlooked because of his airhead-surfer
   stereotype. "His depiction of Hamlet was probably one of the best
   American versions, but everyone still thinks of him as Ted," Murphy
   says, referring to Reeves' role in the 1989 movie Bill & Ted's
   Excellent Adventure. That film grossed $40 million at the box office
   and includes one of the best nuggets of stoner philosophy ever uttered:
   "Be excellent to each other."
   (See the top 10 disappointing box-office blockbusters.)

   But unlike other celebrity-related Internet fads  Chuck Norris facts,
   Lesbians Who Look Like Justin Bieber, Rickrolling  Cheer Up Keanu Day
   seems to be based on sincerity and affection. "At first I thought this
   was a joke," writes Marlon McAllister on the Facebook page, "but then I
   did some research, and he's actually a really supremely nice person ...
   let's show Keanu some love!" Fans have offered to give money to cancer
   research, donate bone marrow or organize charity walks in the actor's
   name (Reeves' sister has been diagnosed with leukemia, hence the
   interest in cancer charities).

   This is the most surprising aspect of the meme. While the Internet is
   most commonly used to mock celebrities, Cheer Up Keanu-ites just want
   to show the star how much they care. On message-board discussions of
   the park-bench photo, there is almost no mention of Reeves' good looks
   or failed Matrix sequels. Even his role in the cult classic Point Break
   is largely ignored. Instead, people fret over Reeves' strained
   relationship with his father and the fact that in 2001 his girlfriend
   died in a car accident. They swap stories about him  Reeves offered a
   ride to a hitchhiker! He bought Harleys for a movie's special-effects
   crew! He treated strangers to breakfast!  that, even if only
   half-true, demonstrate some sort of untapped fondness for an actor of
   otherwise negligible importance. "[His personality] has made me love
   his movies," writes an anonymous commenter on Reddit.com. "I don't care
   how great they are. I love to see him because he makes me happy." In
   other words, it's pretty hard to hate on Reeves.
   (See pictures of Facebook's headquarters.)

   And while Reeves seems to be experiencing a mini-version of what Betty
   White did during the Facebook campaign to get her on Saturday Night
   Live, fans may find him less accepting of the attention  his
   representatives do not want the actor associated with Cheer Up Keanu
   Day. They declined to let the star be interviewed and issued a
   statement saying simply (and somewhat humorlessly), "Keanu Reeves would
   like to thank all of his fans for their concerns regarding his
   happiness and wants to assure everyone that all is well. This situation
   is a result of a misinterpretation of a paparazzi shot."

   "He was just eating a sandwich. Of course he isn't depressed," says
   Murphy. "Cheer Up Keanu Day isn't really about that. We just wanted to
   show him that we cared." And that is pretty excellent.

   Reloaded.

   Underground aquifers, dozens of miles deep and hundreds of miles wide,
   are the Earth's second-largest reserve of fresh water, after ice caps
   and glaciers. Filled over billions of years, they are today being
   drained at two to four times their natural recharge rate. In this
   photo, a team of recreational spelunkers drop into the 160-foot deep
   Neversink Pit in Alabama, which local cavers have bought to preserve
   for future generations.
