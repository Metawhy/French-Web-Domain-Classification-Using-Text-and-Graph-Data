Privacy Policy

   Adello is committed to protecting user privacy. We comply with all
   applicable data protection legislations including the European Data
   Protection Regulations (GDPR), and take a proactive stance by applying
   those in all our markets around the world. The following Privacy Policy
   provides information about Adello and our mobile advertising platform
   AdCTRL, explains who we are, how we collect, share and use information,
   and how users can exercise their privacy rights. The Privacy Policy
   applies to information that we collect through our website
   www.adello.com (“Website”), or process in the course of providing our
   products and services through our Mobile Advertising Platform AdCTRL
   (“AdCTRL”).

   What does Adello do?

   Adello operates AdCTRL, a transparent and neutral mobile advertising
   platform which is based on Adello’s artificial intelligence technology
   and facilitates the creation and execution of mobile advertising
   campaigns on advertising spaces of numerous publications which are
   partly represented by intermediaries (eg. Ad Exchanges), and sold by
   Adello. Adello uses AdCTRL for real-time large-scale data processing.
   This ensures that advertisers and their intermediaries (eg. media
   agencies) are enabled to place ads based on predicted interests,
   affinities and local context, and measure the effectiveness of their
   campaigns. Our aim is to reduce the number of ads that aren’t
   beneficial or of interest to users. AdCTRL is not a data provider, nor
   a media agency nor an ad network. AdCTRL is not built on cookies. The
   platform is operated in the EU and has been developed with user privacy
   at the core of its design from day one. It is subject to GDPR and
   applicable national data protection laws.

   What information do we collect and why?

   As a general rule, we aim not to collect any information which would
   put us into the position of being able to identify an individual. We
   may deviate from this rule only where we have the users consent, where
   we need the information to provide our contractual obligation to them
   or where we have a legitimate interest to do so. The information that
   we collect when a user visits the website, or when we show an ad to a
   user fall into the following categories:

   a) Information that we collect on the Website
   At the user’s discretion, they can provide us with information, and
   some information is automatically provided by the user’s internet
   browser when they visit the Website. These types of information and our
   respective processing purposes are as follows:
                        Types of information                       Why we use it
   Name

   E-mail address

   Company name

   Position

   Phone number

   Country
     * If a user subscribes to our newsletter by providing us with an
       e-mail address, or would like to download material from our
       website, we use the contact information to provide them with the
       requested services.
     * If a user is already a client of Adello, we will use their e-mail
       address, name and business information to maintain their account
       and let them use the products and services offered by Adello.

   Browser type and version

   Operating system

   Referrer URL

   Adello URL’s that are accessed

   Date and time of the access

   IP address (anonymized)

   Cookies
     * Log file data are automatically provided by internet browsers.
     * Collecting this information enables us to better understand the
       users who come to our website, where they come from, and what
       content on our website is of interest to them. We use this
       information for our internal analytics purposes, retargeting
       campaigns, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns and to
       improve the quality and relevance of our website to our visitors.

   If we require personal information not described above, the user will
   be asked for their consent, and the reasons will be made clear to them
   at the point where the information is collected.

   We are using the analysis tool Matomo (Piwik) for anonymized analysis
   of website usage. This is necessary to keep improving our content and
   usability. The collected data is anonymized (i.e. IP Addresses are
   masked) and stored in the EU on our own servers and is not shared with
   any third-party nor sent outside of the EU.

   You can select to opt-out on this page and tracking through our tool
   will be disabled. We respect the “Do-not-Track” setting of your
   browser.

   b) Information that we process through AdCTRL

   The information processed by AdCTRL is usually submitted by the
   publishers or their intermediaries (eg. Ad Exchanges) via application
   programming interfaces (“API”). AdCTRL uses this information to place
   ads on behalf of advertisers which’s product or service is advertised.
   The information consists of pseudonymous data, which is associated by
   Mobile Advertising IDs and IP Addresses to users’ mobile devices. The
   data does not allow Adello to identify individuals.

   The collection and use of the information is governed by the privacy
   policy and legal terms of the publisher who offers the advertising
   space. However, as far as we are technically able to do so, we inform
   users directly at the point where information is collected.
   Types of information Why we use it
   Mobile Advertising ID

   Location Data

   IP Address (anonymized)

   Pixel Tags (Web Beacons)

   Statistical IDs

   Audience Data Segments
   Adello uses this information for online marketing purposes via AdCTRL.
    In detail, we use the information to
     * enable advertisers to customize ads to a particular location and
       users’ location behavior,
     * predict users’ interests and preferences for interest-based
       advertising
     * determine how users respond to certain ads,
     * report aggregated statistics regarding, for example, the
       effectiveness of mobile advertising campaigns and
     * provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance AdCTRL.

   GDPR: Legal basis for processing

   Our legal basis for collecting and processing the information described
   above will depend on the information concerned and the specific context
   in which we collect and process it. In accordance with the European
   GDPR, we collect and process personal information from users only where
   we have their consent (Art. 6 para 1 lit. a) GDPR), where we need the
   information to provide our contractual obligation to them (Art. 6 para
   1 lit. b) GDPR) or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.

   If a user wishes to learn more about specific legal ground(s) we rely
   on to process their information for any particular purpose (including
   any legitimate interests we have to process information), they may
   contact us using the details provided below under “Contact Us.”
   However, by way of example, we rely on our legitimate interests to
   process information for direct marketing purposes and for fraud
   prevention and detection, provided these interests are not overridden
   by a users’ data protection interests or fundamental rights and
   freedoms (Art. 6 para 1 lit. f) GDPR).

   Who do we share user information with?
   Only in the following cases we may disclose personal information to
   third parties:
     * We may, on behalf of our clients and partners, collect information
       from users. This may occur, for example, if someone actively and
       willingly submits information in response to an ad that we provide
       on behalf of an advertising client who will be declared. Such
       information may consist of Personal Identifiable Information (PII),
       non-PII, or both. In such situations, we collect the information
       and provide it to our client, and it will be subject to that
       client’s privacy practices.
     * To our subsidiaries and third-party service providers who provide
       data processing services to us and support us in providing our
       services (for example, to support the delivery of, provide
       functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our website),
       or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are
       described in this Privacy Policy or notified to the user when we
       collect their personal information,
     * To any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government
       agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is
       necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to
       exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect
       the users vital interests or those of any other person,
     * To a potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in connection
       with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of
       our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use the
       users personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this
       Privacy Notice;

   Links to Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Content

   The Website may contain links to other websites, such as sites
   providing news coverage of the company, to partner sites for case
   studies, and to industry association sites of which Adello is a member.
   Adello is not responsible for the privacy notices or practices of these
   third-party websites. Via AdCTRL we provide ads that link to
   third-party sites, third-party apps, or other third-party content. This
   Privacy Policy does not extend to Third-Party Content, or any services
   offered on Third-Party Content.

   Children´s Privacy

   Adello does not knowingly collect any personal information from
   children under age of sixteen (16). If you believe your child has
   provided Adello with personal information, such as by registering at
   the Website, and you would like to have the data removed, please
   contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us”
   heading below.

   Security and International Data Transfer

   Adello utilizes hashing, encryption and de-identification techniques to
   help ensure that the data is safeguarded at all times. Adello enforces
   generally accepted industry security standards on AdCTRL to protect the
   information both during transmission and once it is received. Our
   servers are located in the European Union, the United States of
   America, and in Hong Kong. If a user is located in the EEA, we have
   taken appropriate safeguards to comply with EEA data transfer
   restrictions such as implementing a legal mechanism to lawfully
   transfer their personal information between the EEA and non-EEA
   countries, such as the United States. Where applicable, we implemented
   the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC”) for
   transfers of personal information with our affiliate as well as our
   clients and partners, to protect personal information they process from
   the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Users
   can obtain a copy of the SCC by contacting us using the contact details
   provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.

   How long do we keep user information?

   We retain personal information we collect from users as long as we have
   an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide
   users with a service they have requested or to comply with applicable
   legal, tax or accounting requirements).

   Information that is transferred to us by third parties will be deleted
   after a maximum period of 13 months or earlier. Summarized data is kept
   indefinitely. Summarized data is aggregated statistical data used for
   financial reporting purposes.

   User data protection rights

   Users have the following data protection rights:
     * If a user wishes to opt out from ad tracking in general or from
       AdCTRL in particular they may refer to our opt-out instructions
     * If a user wishes to access, correct, update or request deletion of
       their personal information collected on the Website, or withdraw
       their consent they can do so at any time by contacting us using the
       contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
       Withdrawing their consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
       processing we conducted prior to their withdrawal, nor will it
       affect processing of their personal information conducted in
       reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
     * In addition, if a user is subject to the European Data Protection
       Regulation, they can object to processing of their personal
       information, ask us to restrict processing of their personal
       information or request portability of their personal information.
       Again, they can exercise these rights by contacting us using the
       contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
     * Users have the right to opt-out from our marketing communications
       at any time. They can exercise this right by clicking on the
       “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send
       them. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal
       marketing or telemarketing), users can contact us using the contact
       details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
     * Users have the right to complain to a data protection authority
       about our collection and use of their personal information. For
       more information, they can contact their local data protection
       authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the
       European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European
       countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.) We
       respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to
       exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable
       data protection laws.
