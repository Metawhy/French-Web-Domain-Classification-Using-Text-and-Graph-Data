About Us

   Founded in 2011, the PDR is an online journal and not-for-profit
   project dedicated to the exploration of curious and compelling works
   from the history of art, literature, and ideas.

   As our name suggests, the focus is on works which have now fallen into
   the public domain, that vast commons of out-of-copyright material that
   everyone is free to enjoy, share, and build upon without restriction.
