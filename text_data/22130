Calendar of Events for 2019

   If you live in or near Ann Arbor, Michigan, the best way to see David
   Zinn’s street art is to go outside in nice weather and look down. Even
   if you don’t find one of his drawings, you’ll get some fresh air . . .
   and maybe discover some spare change. However, in case you […]

Underfoot on the Streets of Ann Arbor, 2017

   October 19, 2017 by dszinn@me.com

   2017 has been a busy year on the sidewalk, especially the sidewalks
   hither and yon. That being the case, spontaneous neighborhood creatures
   on the streets of Ann Arbor have been harder to find than usual . . .
   but we managed to collect a few for you here. Enjoy!

Street Art 2016

   January 18, 2017 by dszinn@me.com

   2016 was a great year for drawing on the sidewalk, as this overstuffed
   gallery page will attest. I might separate these out into different
   locations and purposes (e.g. Ann Arbor Summer Festival, stuff I drew in
   Ohio, etc.), especially if people complain that this is too hard to
   browse. In the meantime, enjoy the underfoot […]

   encouragement from all over the world, this full-color, full-size
   book of David Zinn street art is finally available for purchase! The
   concept began as an Indiegogo campaign in December 2014, formulated by
   arts promoter Carolyn Bishop and facilitated by promotional support
   from VideoVision 360. After many […]

   Michigan is, unfortunately, a place where al fresco chalk art is an
   impractical medium for several months of the year. Luckily, Ann Arbor
   is home to a handful of dining establishments with chalk-friendly
   tabletops, and the proprietors are willing to indulge the impatient
   scribblings of a sidewalk artist waiting for snow-free pavement to
   return.  All of […]

Round at Both Ends with a Slug in the Middle

   In September 2013, I was invited to visit four elementary schools in
   Centerville, Ohio as part of their Masterworks program. Driscoll,
   Stingley, Cline and John Hole Elementary all took part, generously
   offering up prominent walls and sidewalks as breakthrough locations for
   Sluggo and his friends.  These photos are courtesy of Saralinda
   Blanning and other volunteers […]

   David Zinn has been creating original artwork in and around Ann Arbor,
   Michigan since 1987. For more than twenty years, he freelanced for a
   wide variety of commercial clients while simultaneously sneaking
   “pointless” art into the world at large. His professional commissions
   included theatrical posters, business logos, educational cartoons,
   landfill murals, environmental superheroes, corporate allegories and
   hand-painted dump trucks, and his less practical creations involved bar
   coasters, restaurant placemats, cake icing, and snow. Now, thanks to
   the temptations of a box of sidewalk chalk on an unusually sunny day,
   Mr. Zinn is known all over the world for the art he creates under his
   feet.

   David’s temporary street drawings are composed entirely of chalk,
   charcoal and found objects, and are always improvised on location
   through a process known as “pareidolic anamorphosis” or “anamorphic
   pareidolia.” Most of his creatures appear on sidewalks in Michigan, but
   many have surfaced as far away as subway platforms in Manhattan,
   village squares in Sweden and street corners in Taiwan. He has achieved
   global notoriety through sharing on the pages of Facebook, Instagram,
   Huffington Post, Graffiti Art Magazine, Bored Panda, Central China
   Television, Street Art Utopia, and Archie McPhee’s Endless Geyser of
   Awesome. His most frequent characters are Sluggo (a bright green
   monster with stalk eyes and irreverent habits) and Philomena (a
   phlegmatic flying pig), but the diversity of Mr. Zinn’s menagerie seems
   to be limited only by the size of the sidewalk and the spirit of the
   day.
