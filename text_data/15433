description

   Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic
   science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore,
   filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and
   action.
   In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited
   by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose.
   Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading
   screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated
   universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players
   have seen before - and perhaps never will again.
   Embark on an epic voyage
   At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you
   on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But,
   facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death
   comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over
   how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.
   Find your own destiny
   Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter,
   preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for
   their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and
   weaponry.
   Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them
   for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge
   rewards.
   Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover
   places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your
   engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in
   toxic environments that would kill the unwary.
   Share your journey
   The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between
   stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the
   police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy,
   and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that
   spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as
   well as your own...

   The Destruction and Violence VS Justice:

   Are you a mastermind of destruction and violence or the man securing
   the safety of the population and the force of justice? Tom Clancy's
   Rainbow Six Siege will transport players in the center of dangerous
   close-quarters conflicts, set between a team of hostage takers and team
   committed in freeing that hostage. Created by the famous Ubisoft
   Montreal studio, Rainbow Six Siege is the latest tactical
   first-person-shooter in the series that will be release on next
   generation consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, as well as on
   Microsoft Windows.

   The Innovation of the Game’s Environment:

   Experience the full multiplayer focus and destructible environments of
   the game that will unleash the aggression, unpredictability and
   tactical thinking of the players. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
   features a technological innovation that will give an exciting way of
   interacting in a game environment. The environment of the game
   corresponds authentically, distinctively and dynamically in any action
   made by the player.

   Strategy and the Ability to Adapt:

   The game, based on the reality of counter terrorist operatives across
   the world, is a tactical 5-v-5 multiplayer shooter with a team of
   terrorist and the armed forces of Rainbow Six team. The terrorist will
   hide the hostage and strategically plan the transformation of their
   environments into a fortress by fortifying the walls, barricading the
   windows, deploying shields and mines, and more! The team of Rainbow Six
   will tactically assault and breach the enemy’s position by blowing up
   walls and windows to create access points and shooting holes in things
   to create lines of sight. Each team will have a way of reconnaissance,
   a CCTV camera for the terrorist and camera drones for Rainbow Six team.
   Being able to see the approaching enemy will give the players the
   chance to adapt their plan and rearrange their map based on what the
   other team is doing.

   A classic reborn! Casual, turn-based strategy in a land of fantastical

   turn-based strategy classic, Mecho Wars. Fully remastered in high
   definition, it features new hand painted art, new visual effects, an
   expanded single-player campaign and six previously unreleased

   Features an easy to learn turn-based combat system, balancing air, sea
   and land units. Further, customize your play with perks unlocked by

   before that happens. After that, your world is your imagination. Turn
   your hours into minutes with Minecraft! To experience split-screen
   functionality a high-definition television is required.

description

   Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic
   science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore,
   filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and
   action.
   In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited
   by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose.
   Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading
   screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated
   universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players
   have seen before - and perhaps never will again.
   Embark on an epic voyage
   At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you
   on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But,
   facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death
   comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over
   how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.
   Find your own destiny
   Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter,
   preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for
   their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and
   weaponry.
   Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them
   for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge
   rewards.
   Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover
   places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your
   engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in
   toxic environments that would kill the unwary.
   Share your journey
   The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between
   stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the
   police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy,
   and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that
   spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as
   well as your own...

   The Destruction and Violence VS Justice:

   Are you a mastermind of destruction and violence or the man securing
   the safety of the population and the force of justice? Tom Clancy's
   Rainbow Six Siege will transport players in the center of dangerous
   close-quarters conflicts, set between a team of hostage takers and team
   committed in freeing that hostage. Created by the famous Ubisoft
   Montreal studio, Rainbow Six Siege is the latest tactical
   first-person-shooter in the series that will be release on next
   generation consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, as well as on
   Microsoft Windows.

   The Innovation of the Game’s Environment:

   Experience the full multiplayer focus and destructible environments of
   the game that will unleash the aggression, unpredictability and
   tactical thinking of the players. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
   features a technological innovation that will give an exciting way of
   interacting in a game environment. The environment of the game
   corresponds authentically, distinctively and dynamically in any action
   made by the player.

   Strategy and the Ability to Adapt:

   The game, based on the reality of counter terrorist operatives across
   the world, is a tactical 5-v-5 multiplayer shooter with a team of
   terrorist and the armed forces of Rainbow Six team. The terrorist will
   hide the hostage and strategically plan the transformation of their
   environments into a fortress by fortifying the walls, barricading the
   windows, deploying shields and mines, and more! The team of Rainbow Six
   will tactically assault and breach the enemy’s position by blowing up
   walls and windows to create access points and shooting holes in things
   to create lines of sight. Each team will have a way of reconnaissance,
   a CCTV camera for the terrorist and camera drones for Rainbow Six team.
   Being able to see the approaching enemy will give the players the
   chance to adapt their plan and rearrange their map based on what the
   other team is doing.
