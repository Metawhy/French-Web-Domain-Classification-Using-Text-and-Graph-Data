Introduction

   Welcome to the website of the European Agency for Special Needs and
   inclusive Education. We are an independent organisation with over 30
   member countries throughout Europe. We work with the ministries of
   education in our member countries to ensure more inclusive education
   systems for all learners. For further information about the Agency and
   its work, please visit the About us section. We also offer Easy to Read
   information.

Accessibility Policy

   The Agency has the vision of becoming a role model of accessibility and
   inclusive practice. Providing a fully accessible experience of the
   Agency and all its activities is the main goal of the Agency’s
   accessibility policy.

   Read more about this on the Accessibility Policy page.

Contact us

   We hope you find the information on this page useful. We see
   accessibility as an on-going process, so if there are ways we might
   improve the overall access, please
   email accessibility@european-agency.org and put ‘Website accessibility’
   in the subject line. We welcome your suggestions for improving our
   website’s accessibility.
     __________________________________________________________________

Website accessibility

   Accessibility is a priority for the Agency. We aim to make our website
   accessible to all users. We do so by providing information in different
   formats for different user needs. For example, we offer an
   accessibility tool, which appears on the right-hand side of every page.

   image of the Agency website accessibility panel
   Accessibility tool

   We want to give control to you, our website’s users, and let you decide
   how to use the website. Hopefully our website accessibility options
   make the information flexible, so you can adapt it to suit your needs.

   We have taken various steps to ensure our website is accessible. These
   include:
     * engaging a web development company to design our website in
       compliance with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Web Content
       Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG);
     * carrying out surveys of our website users and tailoring the website
       to their needs;
     * external user testing with assistive technology users, with
       participants testing the site design and logic during development.

   Our website complies with or exceeds the WCAG 2.0 standards and, where
   possible, complies with WCAG 2.1.

Our accessibility tool

   You can change the way this website looks by clicking the accessibility
   tool on the right of the screen.

Our publications

   We have publications available in different formats, including PDF,
   Word and EPUB3 (electronic book format). We aim to make our
   publications as accessible as possible. However, some of our earlier
   publications, which were created with older software, may not comply
   with all accessibility standards. If you find that any of our
   publications is not accessible or if you require information in another
   format, please email accessibility@european-agency.org and put
   ‘Publications accessibility’ in the subject line.

Our use of images

   All content images on this website include an image caption and
   alternative text that describes what the image represents. Assistive
   technologies, such as screen readers, will detect and read this text.

Visual design

   Our website uses cascading style sheets (CSS) for visual layout. If
   your browser or browsing device does not support CSS, the content of
   each page will still be readable.

Breadcrumb trail

   Our website uses a breadcrumb trail on all pages. A breadcrumb trail is
   a navigation scheme that shows the location of the current page within
   the website’s structure. It shows the user where they are within the
   website and gives them a path back to where they started. It appears at
   the top left of the text and consists of text links separated by the
   ‘greater than’ (>) symbol.

   For example, the screenshot below shows the breadcrumb trail on the
   ‘Data tables and background information’ webpage. It indicates that the
   user is currently on that webpage, which is within the ‘Data’ section
   of the website. In turn, the ‘Data’ section is within ‘Home’. The user
   can access ‘Data’ or ‘Home’ by clicking on the respective link.

Filters

   Some sections of our website use filters to help you find what you’re
   looking for. This is the case for ‘Projects’, ‘News’ and ‘Publications’
   (the latter is within ‘Resources’).

   For example, you can filter ‘Publications’ by Theme, Type, Country,
   Language and Year. You can use just one or several of these categories.
   To do so, click on a category. A number of options will appear. Select
   the ones you are interested in (they will appear highlighted) and click
   ‘Apply’. Any materials tagged with those options will appear. Click
   ‘Reset’ to clear your selections.
