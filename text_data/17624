   1 film set, 7 People, 3 days, 4oz of trash, and 1 grocery bag worth of
   recycling. Isn't that amazing!? ‚Å† ‚Å† To say I'm proud would be an
   understatement! ‚Å† ‚Å† If you know anything about film sets, then you know
   single-use items are ubiquitous. When you're a big enough deal you can
   make requests in your rider like "Blue m&ms in my dressing room." ‚Å† ‚Å† I
   definitely don't classify as big deal, but I did make one request. ‚Å† ‚Å†
   I asked that everyone bring a reusable thermos to avoid single-use
   coffee cups, I feel like that's a fair request, don't you? ‚Å† ‚Å† Well,
   @skillshare went above and BEYOND. They decided to try their very first
   zero-waste shoot!‚Å† ‚Å† They got snacks from the local bulk store,
   growlers of kombucha, coffee, tea, tiffins full of bagels, and vegan
   lunches every afternoon. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å† ‚Å† I'm so freaking elated! I really hope
   this isn't @skillshare's last zero waste shoot or mine either. üòâ‚Å† ‚Å†
   Super excited for the class to go live!!! Which will probably be
   beginning of next year, but can we all just appreciate Nala running
   point on camera 2? She's hoping to make her big brraky as cutest camera
   operator ever. ‚ù§Ô∏è #GoingZeroWaste‚Å† .‚Å† .‚Å† .‚Å† .‚Å† .‚Å† .‚Å† ‚Å†#ecofriendly

   Yesterday was about the past, but today's about the moment everything
   changed... ‚Å† October is national breast cancer awareness month. I don't
   talk about this often because it's a hard story for me to tell. ‚Å† I
   remember sitting in the breast cancer ward as a junior in college and
   feeling wayyy too young to be there. ‚Å† ‚Å† I felt out of place. My world
   was upside down, and everything felt wrong. ‚Å† ‚Å† The tumors were benign,
   but the experience inspired me to look deeper. What was I eating? What
   was in my beauty products? My cleaning products? Plastic??? ‚Å† ‚Å† I had
   so many questions that spurred me into living a more natural lifestyle
   that eventually cured my chronic pain, simplified my life, altered my
   career path, and has introduced me to some of the most amazing and
   caring people in the world.‚Å† ‚Å† 2010 - 2013 were the hardest most
   transformational years of my life. I was completely broke, in and out
   of the hospital for constant monitoring. ‚Å† ‚Å† I was a working
   professional actor out of school when my house burned down, and I lost
   almost everything. ‚Å† ‚Å† Three months after I met my now-husband, he
   asked me to run away with him to California. I thought, what do I have
   to lose? ‚Å† ‚Å† And, that's where I finally pieced it all together. ‚Å† The
   changes I was making for my personal health weren't only better for me,
   they were better for the planet.‚Å† ‚Å† It was so inspiring to read your
   stories yesterday. It was so encouraging knowing that many of you
   didn't grow up in an eco-conscious household. ‚Å† ‚Å† I'm so curious to
   know what inspired you to change? What flipped the switch for you? What
   inspired you to take that first step? To learn more? ‚Å† #goingzerowaste‚Å†

   I üëè am üëè not üëè perfect. Just a friendly reminder, in case you forgot.
   This past weekend, I was reminded of jussst how wasteful I used to
   be... ‚Å† ‚Å† And, TBH, I feel insanely guilty. ‚Å† - I was the average
   American throwing out 4.4lbs of trash a day‚Å† - I constantly grabbed
   plastic water bottles‚Å† - I didn‚Äôt recycle‚Å† - I used tons of straws and
   styrofoam cups‚Å† - There are several times I remember littering‚Å† - I
   used to throw things away simply because it was more convenient to buy
   a new item later ‚Å† - My closet was out of control, I was addicted to
   buying all the new trends ‚Å† - I‚Äôm on the record, in highschool,
   defending anti-environmental legislation and denying climate change‚Å† ‚Å†
   There it is - my dirty laundry. I was so incredibly disconnected from
   everything. I didn‚Äôt understand the problems. ‚Å† ‚Å† If you wanna know why
   I harp so much on being kind to yourself, others, and ditching the idea
   of perfection? It‚Äôs because if you met me back then, you‚Äôd have written
   me off as a lost cause. ‚Å† ‚Å† I share this because as embarrassed as I
   am, it‚Äôs living proof that things and people change. ‚Å† ‚Å† Now, I'm
   dedicated to raising awareness around the issues even down to serving
   my local government in an advisory capacity - complete with my trusty
   reusable water bottle. üòâ‚Å† ‚Å† There‚Äôs hope. Even for THAT person (I know
   you‚Äôre thinking about someone) it just takes time, patience, and most
   importantly compassion.‚Å† ‚Å† Did you grow up super eco-conscious? Or did
   you grow up more like me? ‚Å† #GoingZeroWaste . . . . . . . #zerowaste

   I canceled my trip to New York this September...‚Å† ‚Å† It‚Äôs no secret that
   flying less is a great way to reduce your impact on the environment. I
   don‚Äôt travel very often. ‚Å† ‚Å† Sometimes I feel like the only millennial
   in the world who‚Äôs not interested in that nomad lifestyle.‚Å† ‚Å† I just
   love being at home, anyone else? ‚Å† So, I decided to try a staycation
   instead! I feel like the term staycation can have a negative
   context....‚Å† ‚Å† I think we should reclaim the term and make it sexy! ‚Å† ‚Å†
   Instead of going to NYC, I stayed nearby, packed a bag full of my
   favorite and most versatile @icebreakernz pieces, and explored my own
   city. ‚Å† ‚Å† From finally walking the Golden Gate Bridge, traversing ALL
   of Golden Gate Park and trying to find the best vegan ice-cream in the
   bay. ‚Å† ‚Å† @icebreakernz is the perfect suitcase companion, especially
   for moody SF weather. Their natural fibers are wrinkle-resistant,
   anti-bacterial, anti-microbial and rockstar for temperature regulation
   so you can mix and match their pieces and re-wear them over and over
   again without washing! ‚Å† ‚Å† I wrote a full blog post about my perfect
   3-Day Staycation around the Bay Area, (link in profile) and would LOVE
   to encourage you to switch a far-away vacation to one a little closer
   to home. What do you think!? Are you up for the challenge??? ‚Å†

   #vortexswim #thegreatpacificgarbagepatch‚Å† I canceled my trip to New
   York this September...‚Å† ‚Å† It‚Äôs no secret that flying less is a great
   way to reduce your impact on the environment. I don‚Äôt travel very
   often. ‚Å† ‚Å† Sometimes I feel like the only millennial in the world who‚Äôs
   not interested in that nomad lifestyle.‚Å† ‚Å† I just love being at home,
   anyone else? ‚Å† So, I decided to try a staycation instead! I feel like
   the term staycation can have a negative context....‚Å† ‚Å† I think we
   should reclaim the term and make it sexy! ‚Å† ‚Å† Instead of going to NYC,
   I stayed nearby, packed a bag full of my favorite and most versatile
   @icebreakernz pieces, and explored my own city. ‚Å† ‚Å† From finally
   walking the Golden Gate Bridge, traversing ALL of Golden Gate Park and
   trying to find the best vegan ice-cream in the bay. ‚Å† ‚Å† @icebreakernz
   is the perfect suitcase companion, especially for moody SF weather.
   Their natural fibers are wrinkle-resistant, anti-bacterial,
   anti-microbial and rockstar for temperature regulation so you can mix
   and match their pieces and re-wear them over and over again without
   washing! ‚Å† ‚Å† I wrote a full blog post about my perfect 3-Day Staycation
   around the Bay Area, (link in profile) and would LOVE to encourage you
   to switch a far-away vacation to one a little closer to home. What do
   you think!? Are you up for the challenge??? ‚Å† #GoingZeroWaste

   1 film set, 7 People, 3 days, 4oz of trash, and 1 grocery bag worth of
   recycling. Isn't that amazing!? ‚Å† ‚Å† To say I'm proud would be an
   understatement! ‚Å† ‚Å† If you know anything about film sets, then you know
   single-use items are ubiquitous. When you're a big enough deal you can
   make requests in your rider like "Blue m&ms in my dressing room." ‚Å† ‚Å† I
   definitely don't classify as big deal, but I did make one request. ‚Å† ‚Å†
   I asked that everyone bring a reusable thermos to avoid single-use
   coffee cups, I feel like that's a fair request, don't you? ‚Å† ‚Å† Well,
   @skillshare went above and BEYOND. They decided to try their very first
   zero-waste shoot!‚Å† ‚Å† They got snacks from the local bulk store,
   growlers of kombucha, coffee, tea, tiffins full of bagels, and vegan
   lunches every afternoon. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å† ‚Å† I'm so freaking elated! I really hope
   this isn't @skillshare's last zero waste shoot or mine either. üòâ‚Å† ‚Å†
   Super excited for the class to go live!!! Which will probably be
   beginning of next year, but can we all just appreciate Nala running
   point on camera 2? She's hoping to make her big brraky as cutest camera

   Yesterday was about the past, but today's about the moment everything
   changed... ‚Å† October is national breast cancer awareness month. I don't
   talk about this often because it's a hard story for me to tell. ‚Å† I
   remember sitting in the breast cancer ward as a junior in college and
   feeling wayyy too young to be there. ‚Å† ‚Å† I felt out of place. My world
   was upside down, and everything felt wrong. ‚Å† ‚Å† The tumors were benign,
   but the experience inspired me to look deeper. What was I eating? What
   was in my beauty products? My cleaning products? Plastic??? ‚Å† ‚Å† I had
   so many questions that spurred me into living a more natural lifestyle
   that eventually cured my chronic pain, simplified my life, altered my
   career path, and has introduced me to some of the most amazing and
   caring people in the world.‚Å† ‚Å† 2010 - 2013 were the hardest most
   transformational years of my life. I was completely broke, in and out
   of the hospital for constant monitoring. ‚Å† ‚Å† I was a working
   professional actor out of school when my house burned down, and I lost
   almost everything. ‚Å† ‚Å† Three months after I met my now-husband, he
   asked me to run away with him to California. I thought, what do I have
   to lose? ‚Å† ‚Å† And, that's where I finally pieced it all together. ‚Å† The
   changes I was making for my personal health weren't only better for me,
   they were better for the planet.‚Å† ‚Å† It was so inspiring to read your
   stories yesterday. It was so encouraging knowing that many of you
   didn't grow up in an eco-conscious household. ‚Å† ‚Å† I'm so curious to
   know what inspired you to change? What flipped the switch for you? What
   inspired you to take that first step? To learn more? ‚Å† #goingzerowaste‚Å†

   I üëè am üëè not üëè perfect. Just a friendly reminder, in case you forgot.
   This past weekend, I was reminded of jussst how wasteful I used to
   be... ‚Å† ‚Å† And, TBH, I feel insanely guilty. ‚Å† - I was the average
   American throwing out 4.4lbs of trash a day‚Å† - I constantly grabbed
   plastic water bottles‚Å† - I didn‚Äôt recycle‚Å† - I used tons of straws and
   styrofoam cups‚Å† - There are several times I remember littering‚Å† - I
   used to throw things away simply because it was more convenient to buy
   a new item later ‚Å† - My closet was out of control, I was addicted to
   buying all the new trends ‚Å† - I‚Äôm on the record, in highschool,
   defending anti-environmental legislation and denying climate change‚Å† ‚Å†
   There it is - my dirty laundry. I was so incredibly disconnected from
   everything. I didn‚Äôt understand the problems. ‚Å† ‚Å† If you wanna know why
   I harp so much on being kind to yourself, others, and ditching the idea
   of perfection? It‚Äôs because if you met me back then, you‚Äôd have written
   me off as a lost cause. ‚Å† ‚Å† I share this because as embarrassed as I
   am, it‚Äôs living proof that things and people change. ‚Å† ‚Å† Now, I'm
   dedicated to raising awareness around the issues even down to serving
   my local government in an advisory capacity - complete with my trusty
   reusable water bottle. üòâ‚Å† ‚Å† There‚Äôs hope. Even for THAT person (I know
   you‚Äôre thinking about someone) it just takes time, patience, and most
   importantly compassion.‚Å† ‚Å† Did you grow up super eco-conscious? Or did
   you grow up more like me? ‚Å† #GoingZeroWaste . . . . . . . #zerowaste

   am, it‚Äôs living proof that things and people change. ‚Å† ‚Å† Now, I'm
   dedicated to raising awareness around the issues even down to serving
   my local government in an advisory capacity - complete with my trusty
   reusable water bottle. üòâ‚Å† ‚Å† There‚Äôs hope. Even for THAT person (I know
   you‚Äôre thinking about someone) it just takes time, patience, and most
   importantly compassion.‚Å† ‚Å† Did you grow up super eco-conscious? Or did
   you grow up more like me? ‚Å† #GoingZeroWaste . . . . . . . #zerowaste

   I canceled my trip to New York this September...‚Å† ‚Å† It‚Äôs no secret that
   flying less is a great way to reduce your impact on the environment. I
   don‚Äôt travel very often. ‚Å† ‚Å† Sometimes I feel like the only millennial
   in the world who‚Äôs not interested in that nomad lifestyle.‚Å† ‚Å† I just
   love being at home, anyone else? ‚Å† So, I decided to try a staycation
   instead! I feel like the term staycation can have a negative
   context....‚Å† ‚Å† I think we should reclaim the term and make it sexy! ‚Å† ‚Å†
   Instead of going to NYC, I stayed nearby, packed a bag full of my
   favorite and most versatile @icebreakernz pieces, and explored my own
   city. ‚Å† ‚Å† From finally walking the Golden Gate Bridge, traversing ALL
   of Golden Gate Park and trying to find the best vegan ice-cream in the
   bay. ‚Å† ‚Å† @icebreakernz is the perfect suitcase companion, especially
   for moody SF weather. Their natural fibers are wrinkle-resistant,
   anti-bacterial, anti-microbial and rockstar for temperature regulation
   so you can mix and match their pieces and re-wear them over and over
   again without washing! ‚Å† ‚Å† I wrote a full blog post about my perfect
   3-Day Staycation around the Bay Area, (link in profile) and would LOVE
   to encourage you to switch a far-away vacation to one a little closer
   to home. What do you think!? Are you up for the challenge??? ‚Å†
