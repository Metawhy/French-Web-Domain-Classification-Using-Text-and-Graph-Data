   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Grill itself yourself is fun and tasty in Prague

   This restaurant presents many options. You can grill beef, chicken,
   fish or calamari at your table or allow the kitchen staff to do it for

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   From memory, the ticket counter in the foyer appeared to be well
   stocked but since we're heathens, I didn't take a lot of interest in
   buying any souvenirs However, we were struck by how accessible the
   paintings and artefacts were in the Museum e.g you were allowed to get
   up close and personal to many 700 years old paintings and wooden
   effigies with no restrictions other than an attendant standing at the
   end of the room with his only warning being 'No fllash photography' So
   perhaps you could take many natural light photos for souvenirs (e.g. I
   took several photos of the boards describing the history of ST. Agnes)

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Hell! Please, help me with some information: as a group, we can visit
   the Jewish quarter without a ticket, just walking through, but, if we
   want to go inside the buildings we will pay for e ticket, if necessary?

   An interesting building but the tour was very limited

   We took the guided tour, which is the only way to view the Baroque
   Library Hall, Meridian Hall and the Astronomical Tower, a tiny portion

   Worst tour!!

   understand the reasoning but for the price, we should have been told

   Yes, the library is fascinating, but you can‚Äôt go in or take any photos

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   We loved the location, outside to the Klaster-garden. The menu was not

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Grill itself yourself is fun and tasty in Prague

   This restaurant presents many options. You can grill beef, chicken,
   fish or calamari at your table or allow the kitchen staff to do it for

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   She espoused the Poor Clares who took vows of poverty and care for
   those in need.The silence of some of the open spaces and the chapels is
   soothing and the art displays magnificent.

   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   From memory, the ticket counter in the foyer appeared to be well
   stocked but since we're heathens, I didn't take a lot of interest in
   buying any souvenirs However, we were struck by how accessible the
   paintings and artefacts were in the Museum e.g you were allowed to get
   up close and personal to many 700 years old paintings and wooden
   effigies with no restrictions other than an attendant standing at the
   end of the room with his only warning being 'No fllash photography' So
   perhaps you could take many natural light photos for souvenirs (e.g. I
   took several photos of the boards describing the history of ST. Agnes)

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Hell! Please, help me with some information: as a group, we can visit
   the Jewish quarter without a ticket, just walking through, but, if we
   want to go inside the buildings we will pay for e ticket, if necessary?

   An interesting building but the tour was very limited

   We took the guided tour, which is the only way to view the Baroque

   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the

   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Star√© Mƒõsto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Black Star Restaurant: Don‚Äôt Bother
   "We stumbled into this restaurant by chance, and what a huge mistake it
   was. The exterior is quite inviting with a chalkboard advertising some
   special Italian dishes on the menu. There was only one table occupied,
   which is always a bad sign on a Saturday evening. Since it was not even
   7pm we thought the restaurant would fill up (but it never did). The
   service was ok but the food was downright horrible. My wife and I
   ordered the seafood pasta along with a bottle of sparking water and
   white wine. The seafood wasn‚Äôt very fresh and the pasta had absolutely
   no taste despite adding salt and a dash of chilli flakes to it. The
   meal wasn‚Äôt very expensive but it wasn‚Äôt cheap either. Needless to say
   we left our plates unfinished, paid up and left. I had no idea the
   restaurant was part of a hotel. But if the food is any indication of
   what the hotel might be like, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying
   here either!‚Ä¶"

   review of restaurant only
   "Ate here last week and I must say we were the only eating for a long
   time. The food was distinctly average and the prices a complete rip
   off. We had 2 sea bass and a couple of glasses of wine for ¬£70. The
   waiter then had the cheek to add a service charge of ¬£7 to the bill. We
   ate in many other restaurants during our stay, none of which charged us
   a 10% service charge. This restaurant looks very quaint but to do not
   be fooled by this. The prices are vastly inflated and the quality
   average. Plus the service charge just makes the whole experience taste
   really sour. STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT.‚Ä¶"

   Excellent restaurant
   "Found this gem by accident. Don't know if they've changed management
   since the previous horrible ratings but we enjoyed our meals and
   deserts. The place was packed (Saturday night) and they had to turn
   away a number of hopeful customers."

   Black Star Restaurant - A No No
   "Wished we had seen the previous reviews, nothing has changed. Walked
   past the restaurant on our first night the ladies thought it looked
   cute and quaint with little tables outside and twinkling lights and
   thought it would be a nice place to have an evening meal at, the guys
   agreed and we went and booked a table for the Saturday night. Arrived
   at said time and they said we weren't booked in but it wasn't full so
   we got our table (a choice on a Saturday evening should have been a
   warning!! But after a hectic day sight seeing which included a few bars
   so our senses may have been weakened). Basically the meal was ok, wine
   expensive and not very good, the waiter to be fair was attentive and
   friendly, but this may be because the place wasn't very busy. We asked
   for the bill and paid by debit card, Got a real shock when we got home
   and checked the bank statement and noticed service charge (which wasn't
   on the receipt nor was it explained on the night ). Turned out to be a
   very expensive but in reality, really poor value, which is a shame
   because the location and the building is superb. Have to say far better
   restaurants in the area.‚Ä¶"

   Very Good Italian Food
   "My wife and I always eat the local cuisine. Why travel if you don‚Äôt
   sample the foods of the culture. However, we were getting tired of the
   same thing and found an Italian restaurant for out last meal before
   departing the city (it also had local dishes). It was only a five
   minute walk from the Charles Bridge into the Old City. The food was
   outstanding‚Äîone of the best pieces of lasagna I have had anywhere. My
   wife‚Äôs pasta dish was also superb. Unlike many locals we met, the
   owner, a young man, was very friendly and outgoing. It was a very good
   meal with an entertaining discussion with the proprietor. Highly
   recommend the place.‚Ä¶"

   Perfect location
   "I choose this hotel due to the good reviews and location. We were on a
   family holiday for 4 nights. Some of the reviews have said can be loud
   in the street outside but we did not find this to be a problem and in
   fact enjoyed people watching from our first floor room. Our lovely
   comfortable room had windows on three sides. The view of the old
   cobbled streets was great. The bathroom was a good size with a walk in
   shower and beautifully clean. The breakfasts were very good with a nice
   choice of fruits, pastries and also a hot option cooked to order. The
   staff on reception were very helpful with restaurant recommendations
   explaining that we could buy tram tickets on board with a contactless
   credit card and arranging an early morning car to the airport and had a
   packed breakfast ready to take with us. The location is excellent. The
   Charles bridge is a minutes walk straight from the hotel. We were able
   to go first thing in the morning and also last thing at night when the
   crowds are gone. Everything else was a pleasant stroll away. We were
   able to recharge after a busy morning sightseeing before heading out
   again in the afternoon. It is a very old building but beautifully
   preserved. There is a small lift but being on the first floor we did
   not need it. Overall a friendly small hotel in an excellent location.

   25th anniversary trip to Prague
   "We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the beautiful hotel Aurus
   in the beautiful city of Prague. The staff had very kindy left us a
   bottle of bubbly, chocolates and a lovely little card for our
   anniversary - very thoughtful. We had a suite on floor 2 (room B) which
   was huge and comfortable and very atmospheric with a stunning ceiling
   of painted wooden beams and windows on all sides (it was fun looking
   out at all the people taking photos of the building). Breakfast was
   super - plenty of choice of fresh fruit, breads, yoghurt, cold meats
   etc and a cooked option too. All staff were very pleasant and helpful.
   Excellent location too - after hours of pounding the streets
   sightseeing and getting caught in some heavy downpours, it was great to
   just be able to pop into your room for a rest and a warm-through. So in
   conclusion I would thoroughy recommend the Hotel Aurus to anyone
   visiting Prague who wants a comfortable, welcoming, centrally located
   place to stay. ‚Ä¶"

   Prague's hidden Gem
   "Best hotel in Prague. A converted 1600's hotel with eight spacious
   modernized rooms. The hotel keeps it's old world charm with woodwork
   and furnishings. The bathrooms are completely modernized with walk-in
   showers, double sinks, bidet. Huge closets, super clean rooms, can't
   say enough positive about the hotel. The staff is wonderful and very
   helpful. The rooms are air conditioned, there is an elevator and a
   wonderful full breakfast is served every morning. We have traveled
   quite a bit and stayed in many hotels but this one is by far my
   favorite and the staff is by far the best. Located right in the Old
   Town, it doesn't get more convenient. I would highly recommend Hotel
   Aurus.‚Ä¶"

   Mixed feelings
   "The location is very central which is positive if you want to walk
   around old town. And it is also negative, because it gets very noisy
   during the night when drunk crowds are walking around screaming. The
   room was supposed to be a double or twin room. We expected to have 2
   normal beds. Instead one of us had to sleep on a foldable bed. The
   personnel is friendly not not very experienced. Next time I might chose
   a different hotel.‚Ä¶"

   My husband and me are really excited to travel to Pragur for our
   honeymoon. I was wondering if you have any rooms with balcony. Since we
   are travelling in summer it might get hot do you have aircondition
   rooms or rooms that have windows that can be opened as I get breathing
   problems in closed space. also the room rates are not available on
   TripAdvisor can you please help us with that.

   (BUTTON) Google TranslationDear Madam, thank you for your interest in
   accommodation at our hotel Aurus. I am sorry but we don¬¥t have any
   rooms with balcony but all of our rooms are equipped with aircondition.
   All of our rooms have also the windows but if you are lighter sleeper i
   don¬¥t recommend to sleep with open windows. Best Regards, Martina

   Hi, Can you please comment whether the hotel has elevator/s? Do all
   rooms have elevator access? Would you be able to guarantee booking a
   room for 5th and 6th October that has elevator access? My parents are
   not comfortable walking up the steps. Thanks!

   The building of the Hotel Clementin inherently belongs to Prague
   history, where the first mention dates back to 1360. Rarity is the
   minimum width of the house (3.28 m), making it the narrowest preserved
   house in Prague. Take the advantage of the ideal hotel location on the
   medieval Royal route, connecting the most beautiful places in Prague -
   Old Town Square, Charles Bridge and Prague Castle for many centuries.
   In the heart of the Old Town.

   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Loved this hotel
   "We spent the weekend at the Hotel Clementin. The receptionist Jitka
   could not have been any more helpful and set the scene for a fabulous
   two night stay. The rooms are really luxurious and comfortable. The
   hotel is set in an ideal location very near to many of the local
   attractions, shops, bars and restaurants etc. Even though it is central
   there was no noise late at night. The breakfast was simple but
   delicious, with a good range of pastries, breads, youghurts, fresh
   orange, cheeses and a selection of hot options including omelettes on
   order. We had dinner at Wine o'Clock which is just around the corner
   and that was also very different and worth a visit. We will definitely
   return to the Clementin next visit to Prague.‚Ä¶"

   Excellent Hotel!
   "My partner and I visited Prague recently and stayed in this hotel for
   4 nights. We simply can't say enough good things about it. The hotel is
   small, but the location is excellent and close to everything you'd want
   to see and do. It also had a delicous breakfast each morning and some
   nice cafes and restaurants close by. Additionally, the service received
   by the staff, in particular Romana, was outstanding. She provided some
   great suggestions, knew the city well and made us feel like her
   personal guests. We would definitely recommend this hotel and can't
   thank Romana enough for making our trip to Prague amazing.‚Ä¶"

   Superb Stay - Everything considered, nothing missed
   "Fantastic hotel, enjoyed every bit of the stay. Great location right
   in the middle of the old town with bars and restaurants right at the
   foot of the door. Staff were terrific and very attentive. All the small
   touches were spot on. Breakfast very tasty with a broad selection -
   including complimentary Prosecco! Would absolutely stay here again! ‚Ä¶"

   Is there an elevator/lift?
   Answer from AVEHotels
   Feb 2019 |
   (BUTTON) Google TranslationDear Sirs, thank you for your enquiry! Yes,
   there is a small elevator (as Dorit S correctly mentioned, thank you!).
   But to reach some of the rooms you have to use one flight of stairs as
   well. 7-19:00 my colleagues will gladly help you with the luggage
   though. The building is a part of UNESCO¬¥s protected heritage, so
   alterning the building¬¥s structure by installing certain equipment is
   unfortunately not allowed to us. I hope that I was able to answer your
   question, should you have more, please do not hesitate to contact us
   again anytime! Wishing you a pleasant journey to our marvelous city,
   E.Aljanabi, QC Manager

   Hi in the room we were in last December there was a double and one

   there is a lift in the hotel. However some rooms are located in

   Star√© Mƒõsto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Good location
   "This hotel is perfectly located in the old town, with close access to
   the Charles bridge and a 20 minute stroll to Venceslas Square. There
   are lots of good restaurants in a short distance, even the usual Irish
   bar on the corner (which serves nice food) and an authentic Czech
   restaurant almost opposite (Hada). That said, our room was large and
   comfortable, though a little musty and the curtains didn't fit, which
   is a real drawback! Breakfast was ok, not helped by the indifferent
   server who liked to double-dip into the scrambled eggs as he patrolled.
   The staff were polite but formal - they were functional without being
   friendly. This is a place to sleep and no more, never a 4 star hotel.‚Ä¶"

   Brilliant location, and affordable. No complaints
   "Large bedroom and bathroom. Huge, old building, but in good condition
   and kept very clean. Good wifi in room. Buffet breakfast in the
   basement was fine - and the staff kept all the dishes well stocked.
   Good choices ‚Äì limited hot food, but cereals, fruits, bread, cheese,
   fruit juice, teas/coffee. Very close to Charles Bridge and good

   Hello, We are wondering if the carpets have been changed or cleaned
   lately. Also, curious if there have been any renovations done recently.
   thank you

   .24 bongs at midnight total nightmare. Can you hear the bells in the

   In don't think so. I didn't hear the bells as i think the liliova is
   far enough away from there

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It‚Äôs no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Kri≈æovnick√Ω
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.
