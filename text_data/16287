Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   tellows provides a platform where those who receive frequent spam and
   scam phonecalls can share their knowledge on a particular caller by
   commenting on the phone number's profile. Profiles are generated
   automatically if a number is being searched for the first time. We
   categorise calls by type (debt collection, sweepstakes, etc.) and give
   the number in question a tellows score, which indicates whether a
   number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping you to decide whether or
   not to take the call. This risk rating is generated by a complex
   algorithm that incorporates data such as user ratings and search
   statistics. Want to find out more about how the tellows score works?
   The bulk of the information on the site comes from user reviews and our
   database is constantly expanding and becoming more detailed thanks to
   information from you, our online community. By providing information on
   a number, you can help innumerable other people to anticipate and avoid
   a malicious call.

       The number 02038687678 has been rated with the score 8
       Caller (in a thick Indian / Asian accent) asked by name for a
       previous user of my number. When I said I wasn't that person and
       enquired as to who he was, he got very abusive and terminated the
       call. Almost certainly a scam of some sorts.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   tellows provides a platform where those who receive frequent spam and
   scam phonecalls can share their knowledge on a particular caller by
   commenting on the phone number's profile. Profiles are generated
   automatically if a number is being searched for the first time. We
   categorise calls by type (debt collection, sweepstakes, etc.) and give
   the number in question a tellows score, which indicates whether a
   number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping you to decide whether or
   not to take the call. This risk rating is generated by a complex
   algorithm that incorporates data such as user ratings and search
   statistics. Want to find out more about how the tellows score works?
   The bulk of the information on the site comes from user reviews and our
   database is constantly expanding and becoming more detailed thanks to
   information from you, our online community. By providing information on
   a number, you can help innumerable other people to anticipate and avoid
   a malicious call.
