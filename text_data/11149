   Why is the same word used both for "going quickly" and "not eating?"

   ETYMOLOGY and SPELLING
   Modern English inherits a layered language: Anglo-Saxon/Scandinavian +
   Norman French + Paris French + Latin + Greek. But it is aware of this,
   and has been for centuries, and has built the awareness into its
   spelling. In Samuel Johnson's introduction to his 1755 "Dictionary" he
   says that where a spelling was unsettled, he based his decision on
   pronunciation and etymology, and he gives the edge to etymology: [M]any
   words have likewise been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance,
   as the pronunciation of the vulgar has been weakly followed; and some
   still continue to be variously written, as authors differ in their care
   or skill: of these it was proper to enquire the true orthography, which
   I have always considered as depending on their derivation, and have
   therefore referred them to their original languages. In that test of
   origins, by Johnson and others in his day, modern spelling is forged.
   Mortgage is spelled with a -t- because death is in it. The -c- in
   Arctic touches Arcturus. Johnson's notion of the language was literary,
   not popular. Universal literacy and public education were beyond his
   ken. When Johnson published the second edition of his dictionary in
   1768 he boasted not that it contained all the new words that had come
   into the language since 1755, as a modern dictionary would, but that it
   had more of the words of Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. Nor are all
   words which are not found in the vocabulary, to be lamented as
   omissions. Of the laborious and mercantile part of the people, the
   diction is in a great measure casual and mutable; many of their terms
   are formed for some temporary or local convenience, and though current
   at certain times and places, are in others utterly unknown. This
   fugitive cant, which is always in a state of increase or decay, cannot
   be regarded as any part of the durable materials of a language, and
   therefore must be suffered to perish with other things unworthy of
   preservation. In other words, no slang, no jargon; that was vulgar
   English -- "fugitive cant." The authors might speak it in taverns, but
   they did not dip their pens to it. Johnson doesn't say popular language
   doesn't matter, or that only his words ought to be used by everyone. He
   says these low words are not permanent things. They are the stuff of a
   language, not the brains of it. Johnson is not writing his dictionary
   to dictate what words the lovesick swineherd may and may not use to woo
   the silly shepherdess; he's not telling the prodigal son how to write
   his remorseful letter to dad. But he's showing them how to put power in
   their syllables, if they want it. *** Writing in English shrivels up
   after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Latin and French are the language of
   government, religion, and literature. There seems to be no standard
   spelling in early Middle English, which is probably the age when
   English spelling most closely follows pronunciation. When English
   emerges again wholesale in writing in the 1300s, it begins to acquire a
   standard spelling. This is largely based on two institutions where a
   great many of the people writing the manuscripts -- whether literature
   or government papers -- worked. They were the elite class of
   professional writers who helped shape modern English. Guildhall was the
   London city hall, the seat of the municipal government. There a team of
   clerks and scribes, probably a couple dozen at a time, worked for the
   mayor and aldermen of the city and the sheriffs. The clerks also worked
   ad hoc for the London livery companies. And in their down-time when the
   city courts were inactive, at Christmas or over the summers, they were
   copying out, freelance, prized editions of Chaucer for wealthy
   customers. Probably more important to English were the clerks of the
   Chancery -- the royal government in Westminster (outside the walls of
   London and safe from its mobs in 1400, but well within the built-up
   city today). "Chancery Standard" was, from the early 1400s, the
   official written language of the English government. In the 1400s, the
   Chancery was almost the entire national bureaucracy (except the
   Exchequer). The royal chancellor had a staff of skilled assistants. By
   1400 it is estimated the chancery was composed of 120 clerks. Each of
   the 12 major clerks had his own house where minor clerks and candidates
   for clerkship lived, along with aspirants to the Inns of Court, who
   there learned the mysteries of writs and pleas and other formal
   procedures of administration. Correct use of the standard language was
   essential. These professional scribes of the Chancery Office wrote
   almost all the royal government's legal documents, which circulated
   throughout England. Their primary concern would have been to maintain a
   comprehensible official idiom for communication through the kingdom.
   This hardly need have anything to do with pronunciation. The Chancery
   Standard that emerged from the 1300s was, as such things tend to be,
   backward-looking and conservative. Though phonetic spellings for words
   like high and though were in use from the 1300s, Chancery scribes kept
   the old spellings, no longer reflecting the pronunciation. In the 1400s
   the Chancery scribes made choices between the options in front of them.
   Some of the options were rooted in England's dialects: egg or ey? shoes
   or shoen? They went with egg and shoes, and we've followed them ever
   since. To say they had etymology in mind doesn't just mean they looked
   to the past. It means they had a mind to the familial relationship of
   the forms, not just to the sound of the words. So in the 1300s you
   would have had kingez with a -z as the plural of king, but the Chancery
   scribes would make it -s; all the "s" plurals became -s, even if they
   sound like -z. William Caxton, the first English printer (working in
   the last quarter of the 1400s), churned out hundreds of books and
   helped set the spelling standard. He published chivalric romances,
   classical works, Aesop's Fables, the Reynard the Fox stories, English
   and Roman histories, and poetry by Chaucer and his contemporaries.
   These were the books that appealed to the English upper classes in the
   late 1400s. Caxton printed almost nothing by contemporary authors. That
   had an effect on the spelling. Chaucer (dead a century by then) was so
   important and so well-known that Caxton didn't modernize his spellings,
   even though the kn- and -gh- in knight no longer were pronounced. The
   general tendencies that Caxton began, or rather continued from the
   Chancery and the Guildhall, were continued by his successors. The idea
   of "writing" in the minds of all these clerks and scribes is not the
   internet or public education of everyone’s children. Neither is it
   textual representation of speech. They were solving the practical
   problem of how to send documents that could be understood across the
   King's realm in 1421. And ever since then, reformers have been trying
   to "fix" English spelling, to make dogs have a -z and cats have an -s.
   And then you lose the notational quality of what the plural affix is.
   Forget spelling reform based on pronunciation. Whose pronunciation
   should we choose? Modern sensibilities would disdain as prescriptivist
   any standard of spelling, however logical or practical, that ignores
   everyone else's individuality or anyone's group identity. What you'd
   end up with if you shifted English writing to a purely phonetic basis
   is, at best, a set of 20 or 30 mutually incomprehensible writing
   systems -- one each for London (probably actually 5 or more just for
   London), Jamaica, Edmonton, Singapore, Perth, New Delhi, New Orleans,
   Lagos, etc., etc. At worst, every individual would have his or her own
   ever-shifting standard of spelling. Come to think of it, that's
   Twitter. *** In the 1500s, after English has ousted French as the
   language of literature and governance in England, the scribes and
   scholars begin to deliberately change it. English writers begin to pull
   their Latin words directly from ancient Roman secular writers rather
   than Medieval Church Latin or French. And the writers and scholars look
   at the older words which came up into English through vernacular French
   from Vulgar Latin, and they recognize the slop and scars. In the 1500s
   and after, knowledge of etymology becomes a driver of English spelling.
   The writers in the language begin to rinse the French from their words.
   Chaucer's pilgrims came together by chance, or as he put it, by
   aventure. By the 1500s this word has become adventure through awareness
   of Latin and that it is a compound in ad. And so Middle English amonish
   becomes admonish. Aminister, administer. Avance changes to advance. The
   restored forms then changed the pronunciations. But sometimes they
   don't, and they leave a spelling dissonance, as in indict, which before
   1600 or so used to be spelled endite and still is pronounced that way.
   They restored -d- in adjudge and the -b- in debt, doubt, and subtle,
   though none is pronounced. Victuals was respelled along the Latin model
   in the 1500s, but it is still vulgarly "vittles." The restored
   classical –h- has changed the pronunciation of authentic, horizon,
   Hebrew, hypocrisy, hectic, and homily. But in stomach, asthma, school,
   chronicle, chameleon, character, rhyme, and rhythm, it has not. The -l-
   was restored (and generally sounded) in fault, vault, assault,
   culpable, and cauldron. The -g- came back in impregnable and
   cognizance. The -p- in corpse. The -n- was restored in convent (its
   doublet, coven, hasn't changed, probably because it had taken on a
   specialized, non-classical sense). Sometimes the effort to be
   classically correct went too far. Admiral had been amiral, which was
   right, the word was from Arabic and is the same as emir. But presumed
   Latin added an excrescent -d- to it. As the pronunciation followed the
   change, the etymological error did not create a spelling trap. It does,
   however, in scythe, an Old English word, which was falsely derived from
   Latin scindere "to cut," and so a -c- was added. A faulty etymology of
   a Germanic word as a Latin one also put the -s- in island, presuming it
   was based on isle. Even worse, the mistake contaminated the unrelated
   word aisle (of a church); it comes from a Latin word for "wing," but by
   the late Middle Ages it had become confused with the isle that means
   “island,” and it partook of the excrescent -s-. Sometimes they just
   bungled it: Anthem was Middle English anteme; the -h- is an attempt at
   Greek, but the Greek word was antiphona. Comptroller is a bungled
   etymologizing of controller as though it came from Latin computare (the
   verb behind computer). Author and authority acquired the -h- by
   confusion with authentic, but author and authority are from Latin, not
   Greek, and they never had a -th-. Not all of it has stuck: Conceit,
   deceit, and receipt all are from Latin capere; the -p- sometimes was
   restored in all of them, but it has stuck only in the last.

Online Etymology Dictionary

   This is a map of the wheel-ruts of modern English. Etymologies are not
   definitions; they're explanations of what our words meant and how they
   sounded 600 or 2,000 years ago.

   The dates beside a word indicate the earliest year for which there is a
   surviving written record of that word (in English, unless otherwise
   indicated). This should be taken as approximate, especially before
   about 1700, since a word may have been used in conversation for
   hundreds of years before it turns up in a manuscript that has had the
   good fortune to survive the centuries.

   The basic sources of this work are Weekley's "An Etymological
   Dictionary of Modern English," Klein's "A Comprehensive Etymological
   Dictionary of the English Language," "Oxford English Dictionary"
   (second edition), "Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology," Holthausen's
   "Etymologisches Wörterbuch der Englischen Sprache," and Kipfer and
   Chapman's "Dictionary of American Slang."A full list of print sources
   used in this compilation can be found here.

   Since this dictionary went up, it has benefited from the suggestions of
   dozens of people I have never met, from around the world. Tremendous
   thanks and appreciation to all of you.
