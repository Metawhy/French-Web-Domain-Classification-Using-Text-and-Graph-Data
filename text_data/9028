Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Overview

     * Program Overview
     * EDSP Approach
     * Public Participation

Program Overview

   [INS: T :INS] he Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP)[INS: uses
   a  :INS] two tiered approach to screen pesticides, chemicals, and
   environmental contaminants for their potential effect on estrogen,
   androgen and thyroid hormone systems.[INS: The EDSP is outlined in two
   Federal Register Notices published in 1998. :INS]

   The EDSP is mandated to use validated methods for the screening and
   testing chemicals to identify potential endocrine disruptors, determine
   adverse effects, dose-response, assess risk and ultimately manage risk
   under current laws. These methods or assays allow EPA to identify and
   characterize the endocrine activity (specifically, estrogen, androgen
   and thyroid) of pesticides, commercial chemicals, and environmental
   contaminants.

Program History

   In the 1990's, some scientists proposed that certain chemicals might be
   disrupting the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife. A variety of
   chemicals have been found to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals
   in laboratory studies, and compelling evidence shows that endocrine
   systems of certain fish and wildlife have been affected by chemical
   contaminants, resulting in developmental and reproductive problems.

   Based on this and other evidence, Congress passed the Food Quality
   Protection Act (FQPA), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
   Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments
   in 1996. FQPA requires that EPA screen pesticide chemicals for their
   potential to produce effects similar to those produced by the female
   hormones (estrogen) in humans and gives EPA the authority to screen
   certain other chemicals and to include other endocrine effects.

   In October 1996, under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee
   Act (FACA), EPA chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the
   Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC)
   -- to advise EPA on establishing a program to carry out Congress's
   directives. The EDSTAC committee members were charged with developing
   consensus-based recommendations for a scientifically defensible
   screening program that would provide EPA the necessary information to
   make regulatory decisions about the endocrine effects of
   chemicals. Over the course of two years, EDSTAC members thoroughly
   reviewed and discussed scientific information and sought the opinion of
   other experts and members of the public. EDSTAC's Final Report was
   presented to EPA in September 1998.

   milestones.

EDSP Approach

Related Links

     * EDSP in the 21st Century
     * How EPA uses information from the screening program

   The EDSP uses a tiered approach for screening chemicals. Under the
   tiered approach:
     * Tier 1 screening data is used to identify substances that have the
       potential to interact with the endocrine system. Chemicals that go
       through Tier 1 screening and are found to exhibit the potential to
       interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid hormone systems
       will proceed to Tier 2 for testing.
     * Tier 2 testing data identifies any adverse endocrine-related
       effects caused by the substance, and establish a quantitative
       relationship between the dose and that adverse effect. The results
       of Tier 2 testing will be combined with other hazard information
       and exposure assessment on a given chemical resulting in the risk
       assessment. Risk assessments are used to inform risk mitigation
       measures, as necessary, and regulatory decisions concerning
       chemicals.

   As the EDSP screening and testing requirements mature into routine
   evaluations, the Agency intends to utilize the pesticide registration
   review process as the framework for managing its responsibilities
   regarding the endocrine screening of pesticides, and intends to
   eventually incorporate these requirements routinely into the pesticide
   registration review process.

   While EPA has discretionary authority to issue, at any time, testing
   orders requiring manufacturers to conduct Tier 1 assays, the Agency
   plans to assess the performance of the Tier 1 battery based on the test
   data received for the initial list (List 1) of chemicals before
   beginning to routinely issue orders to test additional chemicals. If
   EDSP data exist at the time of a pesticide’s registration review, the
   Agency will consider the data when it makes its Federal Insecticide,
   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (3)(c)(5) finding under
   registration review.

   Key components of the EDSP include:
    1. Assay Validation
    2. Chemical Selection/Prioritization
    3. Policies and Procedures
    4. Use of High Throughput Screening and Computational Models

Public Participation

   EPA has involved the public, stakeholders, and has coordinated with
   international organizations in implementing EDSP. In October 1996,
   under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), EPA
   chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the Endocrine Disruptor
   Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC) -- to advise EPA on
   establishing a program to carry out Congress's directives.

   After EDSTAC completed its work and disbanded in 1998, EPA organized a
   Standardization and Validation Task Force (SVTF) consisting of
   representation from a broad range of sectors, including federal
   agencies, agrichemical companies, commodity chemical companies, and
   environmental and public health organizations to coordinate and conduct
   the scientific and technical work necessary to validate the screens and
   tests recommended by the EDSTAC.

   In 2001, SVTF was replaced by the Endocrine Disruptor Methods
   Validation Subcommittee (EDMVS), a subcommittee of an Advisory Council
   (NACEPT) established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. As a
   charter member and co-chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee
   on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), EPA followed the
   interagency validation framework in the development and refinement of
   assays to reduce animal use, refine procedures involving animals to
   make them less stressful, and replace animals where scientifically
   appropriate.

   In addition to the ICCVAM approach to assay validation in the United
   States, EPA considered the European approach by the European Center for
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), as well as the
   international approach by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) since some screening assays involved a
   collaborative validation effort with OECD.

   In 2004, the Endocrine Disruptor Methods Validation Advisory Committee
   (EDMVAC) was formed to replace EDMVS. The EDMVAC continued to function
   like EDMVS by providing advice and recommendations to EPA on scientific
   and technical aspects of the Tier 1 screens and Tier 2 assays being
   considered for the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

   In 2007, the EDMVAC was disbanded, and the functions of this advisory
   committee were taken over by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
   Rodenticide Act Science Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP). The Panel provides
   scientific advice, information, and recommendations to the EPA
   Administrator on pesticides and pesticide related issues as to the
   impact on health and the environment of regulatory actions. The FIFRA
   SAP will continue to evaluate relevant scientific issues, protocols,
   data, and interpretations of the data for the assays during
   the validation process.

   EPA estimated that in 2015 in the United States, more food reached
   landfills and combustion facilities than any other single material in
   our everyday trash, at 22 percent of the amount landfilled and at 22
   percent of the amount combusted with energy recovery. Reducing food
   waste will help the United States address climate change, as 20 percent
   of total U.S. methane emissions come from landfills. By keeping
   wholesome and nutritious food in our communities and out of our
   landfills, we can help address the 42 million Americans that live in
   food insecure households.

U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal

   On September 16, 2015, in alignment with Target 12.3 of the UN
   Sustainable Development Goals, Exit the United States Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) and EPA announced the first ever domestic goal to
   reduce food loss and waste by half by the year 2030. By taking action
   on the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal (2030 FLW reduction
   goal), the United States can help feed the hungry, save money for
   families and businesses and protect the environment. Led by USDA and
   EPA, the federal government is seeking to work with communities,
   organizations and businesses along with our partners in state, tribal
   and local government to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent over
   the next 15 years.

     __________________________________________________________________

Measuring the Success of the Goal

   To measure and describe progress against the goal, the following two
   different, but equally important, baselines were chosen for the 2030
   FLW reduction goal:
     * For food waste in the United States, EPA’s “Advancing Sustainable
       Materials Management: Facts and Figures” provides an estimate of
       the amount of food going to landfills and combustion with energy
       recovery from residences, commercial establishments (e.g. grocery
       stores and restaurants), and institutional sources (e.g. school
       cafeterias). Preconsumer food generated during the manufacturing
       and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste
       estimates. Using the available data, 2010 was selected as a
       baseline at 218.9 pounds of food waste per person sent to landfills
       and combustion with energy recovery. The 2030 FLW reduction goal
       aims to reduce food waste going to landfills and combustion with
       energy recovery by 50 percent to 109.4 pounds per person.
     * For food loss in the United States, USDA’s Economic Research
       Service has estimated the amount of available food supply that went
       uneaten at the retail and consumer levels. In the baseline year of
       2010, food loss was 31 percent of the food supply, equaling 133
       billion pounds and an estimated value of $161.6 billion. The 2030
       FLW reduction goal aims to cut food loss at the retail and consumer
       level in half, by approximately 66 billion pounds.

   Over the next 15 years, we hope to see 50 percent reductions in both
   baseline measurements.

How Does EPA Plan to Take Action on the Goal?

   Working with USDA and partners in the states and tribes, EPA plans to
   secure action on the 2030 FLW reduction goal by working with leaders in
   the food system (e.g., private, government, nonprofit, academia, faith)
   to promote action and bring more successful interventions and tools to
   advance the sustainable management of food.

   EPA launched a Call to Action by Stakeholders page, which identifies
   current opportunities and challenges in reducing food loss and waste in
   the United States. EPA will continue to help facilitate discussion by
   co-hosting summits where leaders in various sectors can exchange ideas
   and identify needed actions, provide leadership and technical
   assistance, conduct outreach and share information, develop new tools,
   and celebrate the successes of stakeholders.

What is Sustainable Management of Food?

   Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach that seeks to
   reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life
   cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing,
   sales, and consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final
   disposal. EPA works to promote innovation and highlight the value and
   efficient management of food as a resource. Through the sustainable
   management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money,
   provide a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to
   eat, and conserve resources for future generations. Building on the
   familiar concept of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," this approach shifts the
   view on environmental protection and more fully recognizes the impacts
   of the food we waste.

What is Wasted Food and Where Does it Come From?

   The term “wasted food” describes food that was not used for its
   intended purpose and is managed in a variety of ways, such as donation
   to feed people, creation of animal feed, composting, anaerobic
   digestion, or sending to landfills or combustion facilities. Examples
   include unsold food from retail stores; plate waste, uneaten prepared
   food, or kitchen trimmings from restaurants, cafeterias, and
   households; or by-products from food and beverage processing
   facilities. EPA uses the overarching term “wasted food” instead of
   “food waste” for food that was not used for its intended purpose
   because it conveys that a valuable resource is being wasted, whereas
   “food waste” implies that the food no longer has value and needs to be
   managed as waste.
     * Excess food refers to food that is recovered and donated to feed
       people.
     * Food waste refers to food such as plate waste (i.e., food that has
       been served but not eaten), spoiled food, or peels and rinds
       considered inedible that is sent to feed animals, to be composted
       or anaerobically digested, or to be landfilled or combusted with
       energy recovery.
     * Food loss refers to unused product from the agricultural sector,
       such as unharvested crops.

   EPA encourages anyone managing wasted food to reference the Food
   Recovery Hierarchy. When the higher levels of the hierarchy are no
   longer feasible, then the food waste left over should be put to
   beneficial use such as composted or sent to be broken down through
   anaerobic digestion. Additional resources on wasted food can be found
   at Further with Food: Center for Food Loss and Waste Solutions.Exit

     __________________________________________________________________

Why is Sustainable Management of Food Important?

   Wasted food is a growing problem in our modern society and an untapped
   opportunity. In 2015 alone, more than 39 million tons of food waste was
   generated, with only 5.3 percent diverted from landfills and
   incinerators for composting. EPA estimates that more food reaches
   landfills and incinerators than any other single material in our
   everyday trash, constituting 22 percent of discarded municipal solid
   waste. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   estimates that in 2010, 31 percent or 133 billion pounds of the 430
   billion pounds of food produced was not available for human consumption
   at the retail and consumer levels (i.e., one-third of the food
   available was not eaten).^1

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   estimated in 2011 that approximately one-third of all food produced for
   human consumption worldwide is lost or wasted.^2 Taking simple steps in
   your everyday life can make a difference in addressing this issue.
   Reducing wasted food is a triple win; it's good for the economy, for
   communities, and for the environment.

Saving Money

   When we waste food, we’re not just creating a problem, we’re also
   missing an opportunity to save businesses and consumers money:
     * Pay Less for Trash Pickup – Organizations might pay less for trash
       pickup by keeping wasted food out of the garbage. Some haulers
       lower fees if wasted food is separated from the trash and sent to a
       compost facility instead of the landfill.
     * Receive Tax Benefits by Donating – If you donate healthy, safe, and
       edible food to hungry people, your organization can claim tax
       benefits. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act protects food donors
       from legal liability.
     * Waste Less and Spend Less – If you or your organization can find
       ways to prevent waste in the first place, you can spend less by
       buying only the food you will use. Preventing wasted food can also
       reduce energy and labor costs associated with throwing away good
       food.

   Top of Page

Helping People

   Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can
   help you make a difference in your community:
     * Feed People, Not Landfills – Instead of feeding landfills, we
       should be feeding people in our communities. You can donate a
       variety of foods to many different types of organizations. Contact
       Feeding America Exit or your local food rescue organizations for
       information about where you can donate and what types of food your
       local organization is able to accept.
     * Feed Children – In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
       National School Lunch Program provided nutritionally balanced,
       low-cost or free lunches to more than 31 million children each
       school day.^4 By redirecting food that would otherwise be wasted to
       homes and schools, we can help feed our country’s children.
     * Create Job Opportunities – Recovering and recycling wasted food
       through donation, salvaging, processing, industrial reuse, and
       composting strengthens infrastructure and creates jobs. Food
       recycling in these sectors employs more than 36,000 people,
       supporting local economies and promoting innovation.^5
     * Feed the World – According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
       of the United Nations, from 2012 to 2014 there were about 805
       million hungry people on earth. They predict that by eliminating
       food loss and wasted food we would have enough food to feed all the
       chronically undernourished. They also expect that we wouldn’t have
       to increase food production or put additional pressure on our
       natural resources to do so.^3

Conserving Resources

   Reducing wasted food does great things for the environment:
     * Reduce Methane from Landfills – When food goes to the landfill,
       it’s similar to tying food in a plastic bag. The nutrients in the
       food never return to the soil. The wasted food rots and produces
       methane gas.
     * Save Resources – Wasted food wastes the water, gasoline, energy,
       labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers used to make the food.
       When we throw food in the trash, we’re throwing away much more than
       food.
     * ​Return Nutrients to the Soil – If you can’t prevent, reduce or
       donate wasted food, you can compost. By sending food scraps to a
       composting facility instead of to a landfill or composting at home,
       you’re helping make healthy soils. Adding compost to gardens,
       highway construction sites, and poor soils makes great things
       happen. Properly composted organics (wasted food and yard waste)
       improve soil health and structure, improve water retention, support
       more native plants, and reduce the need for fertilizers and
       pesticides.

Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Overview

     * Program Overview
     * EDSP Approach
     * Public Participation

Program Overview

   [INS: T :INS] he Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP)[INS: uses
   a  :INS] two tiered approach to screen pesticides, chemicals, and
   environmental contaminants for their potential effect on estrogen,
   androgen and thyroid hormone systems.[INS: The EDSP is outlined in two
   Federal Register Notices published in 1998. :INS]

   The EDSP is mandated to use validated methods for the screening and
   testing chemicals to identify potential endocrine disruptors, determine
   adverse effects, dose-response, assess risk and ultimately manage risk
   under current laws. These methods or assays allow EPA to identify and
   characterize the endocrine activity (specifically, estrogen, androgen
   and thyroid) of pesticides, commercial chemicals, and environmental
   contaminants.

Program History

   In the 1990's, some scientists proposed that certain chemicals might be
   disrupting the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife. A variety of
   chemicals have been found to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals
   in laboratory studies, and compelling evidence shows that endocrine
   systems of certain fish and wildlife have been affected by chemical
   contaminants, resulting in developmental and reproductive problems.

   Based on this and other evidence, Congress passed the Food Quality
   Protection Act (FQPA), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
   Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments
   in 1996. FQPA requires that EPA screen pesticide chemicals for their
   potential to produce effects similar to those produced by the female
   hormones (estrogen) in humans and gives EPA the authority to screen
   certain other chemicals and to include other endocrine effects.

   In October 1996, under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee
   Act (FACA), EPA chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the
   Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC)
   -- to advise EPA on establishing a program to carry out Congress's
   directives. The EDSTAC committee members were charged with developing
   consensus-based recommendations for a scientifically defensible
   screening program that would provide EPA the necessary information to
   make regulatory decisions about the endocrine effects of
   chemicals. Over the course of two years, EDSTAC members thoroughly
   reviewed and discussed scientific information and sought the opinion of
   other experts and members of the public. EDSTAC's Final Report was
   presented to EPA in September 1998.

   View the interactive EDSP timeline for an overview of program
   milestones.

EDSP Approach

Related Links

     * EDSP in the 21st Century
     * How EPA uses information from the screening program

   The EDSP uses a tiered approach for screening chemicals. Under the
   tiered approach:
     * Tier 1 screening data is used to identify substances that have the
       potential to interact with the endocrine system. Chemicals that go
       through Tier 1 screening and are found to exhibit the potential to
       interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid hormone systems
       will proceed to Tier 2 for testing.
     * Tier 2 testing data identifies any adverse endocrine-related
       effects caused by the substance, and establish a quantitative
       relationship between the dose and that adverse effect. The results
       of Tier 2 testing will be combined with other hazard information
       and exposure assessment on a given chemical resulting in the risk
       assessment. Risk assessments are used to inform risk mitigation
       measures, as necessary, and regulatory decisions concerning
       chemicals.

   As the EDSP screening and testing requirements mature into routine
   evaluations, the Agency intends to utilize the pesticide registration
   review process as the framework for managing its responsibilities
   regarding the endocrine screening of pesticides, and intends to
   eventually incorporate these requirements routinely into the pesticide
   registration review process.

   While EPA has discretionary authority to issue, at any time, testing
   orders requiring manufacturers to conduct Tier 1 assays, the Agency
   plans to assess the performance of the Tier 1 battery based on the test
   data received for the initial list (List 1) of chemicals before
   beginning to routinely issue orders to test additional chemicals. If
   EDSP data exist at the time of a pesticide’s registration review, the
   Agency will consider the data when it makes its Federal Insecticide,
   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (3)(c)(5) finding under
   registration review.

   Key components of the EDSP include:
    1. Assay Validation
    2. Chemical Selection/Prioritization
    3. Policies and Procedures
    4. Use of High Throughput Screening and Computational Models

Public Participation

   EPA has involved the public, stakeholders, and has coordinated with
   international organizations in implementing EDSP. In October 1996,
   under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), EPA
   chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the Endocrine Disruptor
   Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC) -- to advise EPA on
   establishing a program to carry out Congress's directives.

   After EDSTAC completed its work and disbanded in 1998, EPA organized a
   Standardization and Validation Task Force (SVTF) consisting of
   representation from a broad range of sectors, including federal
   agencies, agrichemical companies, commodity chemical companies, and
   environmental and public health organizations to coordinate and conduct
   the scientific and technical work necessary to validate the screens and
   tests recommended by the EDSTAC.

   In 2001, SVTF was replaced by the Endocrine Disruptor Methods
   Validation Subcommittee (EDMVS), a subcommittee of an Advisory Council
   (NACEPT) established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. As a
   charter member and co-chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee
   on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), EPA followed the
   interagency validation framework in the development and refinement of
   assays to reduce animal use, refine procedures involving animals to
   make them less stressful, and replace animals where scientifically
   appropriate.

   In addition to the ICCVAM approach to assay validation in the United
   States, EPA considered the European approach by the European Center for
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), as well as the
   international approach by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) since some screening assays involved a
   collaborative validation effort with OECD.

   In 2004, the Endocrine Disruptor Methods Validation Advisory Committee
   (EDMVAC) was formed to replace EDMVS. The EDMVAC continued to function
   like EDMVS by providing advice and recommendations to EPA on scientific
   and technical aspects of the Tier 1 screens and Tier 2 assays being
   considered for the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

   In 2007, the EDMVAC was disbanded, and the functions of this advisory
   committee were taken over by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
   Rodenticide Act Science Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP). The Panel provides
   scientific advice, information, and recommendations to the EPA
   Administrator on pesticides and pesticide related issues as to the
   impact on health and the environment of regulatory actions. The FIFRA
   SAP will continue to evaluate relevant scientific issues, protocols,
   data, and interpretations of the data for the assays during
   the validation process.

   EPA estimated that in 2015 in the United States, more food reached
   landfills and combustion facilities than any other single material in
   our everyday trash, at 22 percent of the amount landfilled and at 22
   percent of the amount combusted with energy recovery. Reducing food
   waste will help the United States address climate change, as 20 percent
   of total U.S. methane emissions come from landfills. By keeping
   wholesome and nutritious food in our communities and out of our
   landfills, we can help address the 42 million Americans that live in
   food insecure households.

U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal

   On September 16, 2015, in alignment with Target 12.3 of the UN
   Sustainable Development Goals, Exit the United States Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) and EPA announced the first ever domestic goal to
   reduce food loss and waste by half by the year 2030. By taking action
   on the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal (2030 FLW reduction
   goal), the United States can help feed the hungry, save money for
   families and businesses and protect the environment. Led by USDA and
   EPA, the federal government is seeking to work with communities,
   organizations and businesses along with our partners in state, tribal
   and local government to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent over
   the next 15 years.

     __________________________________________________________________

Measuring the Success of the Goal

   To measure and describe progress against the goal, the following two
   different, but equally important, baselines were chosen for the 2030
   FLW reduction goal:
     * For food waste in the United States, EPA’s “Advancing Sustainable
       Materials Management: Facts and Figures” provides an estimate of
       the amount of food going to landfills and combustion with energy
       recovery from residences, commercial establishments (e.g. grocery
       stores and restaurants), and institutional sources (e.g. school
       cafeterias). Preconsumer food generated during the manufacturing
       and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste
       estimates. Using the available data, 2010 was selected as a
       baseline at 218.9 pounds of food waste per person sent to landfills
       and combustion with energy recovery. The 2030 FLW reduction goal
       aims to reduce food waste going to landfills and combustion with
       energy recovery by 50 percent to 109.4 pounds per person.
     * For food loss in the United States, USDA’s Economic Research
       Service has estimated the amount of available food supply that went
       uneaten at the retail and consumer levels. In the baseline year of
       2010, food loss was 31 percent of the food supply, equaling 133
       billion pounds and an estimated value of $161.6 billion. The 2030
       FLW reduction goal aims to cut food loss at the retail and consumer
       level in half, by approximately 66 billion pounds.

   Over the next 15 years, we hope to see 50 percent reductions in both
   baseline measurements.

How Does EPA Plan to Take Action on the Goal?

   Working with USDA and partners in the states and tribes, EPA plans to
   secure action on the 2030 FLW reduction goal by working with leaders in
   the food system (e.g., private, government, nonprofit, academia, faith)
   to promote action and bring more successful interventions and tools to
   advance the sustainable management of food.

   EPA launched a Call to Action by Stakeholders page, which identifies
   current opportunities and challenges in reducing food loss and waste in
   the United States. EPA will continue to help facilitate discussion by
   co-hosting summits where leaders in various sectors can exchange ideas
   and identify needed actions, provide leadership and technical
   assistance, conduct outreach and share information, develop new tools,
   and celebrate the successes of stakeholders.

What is Sustainable Management of Food?

   Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach that seeks to
   reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life
   cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing,
   sales, and consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final
   disposal. EPA works to promote innovation and highlight the value and
   efficient management of food as a resource. Through the sustainable
   management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money,
   provide a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to
   eat, and conserve resources for future generations. Building on the
   familiar concept of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," this approach shifts the
   view on environmental protection and more fully recognizes the impacts
   of the food we waste.

What is Wasted Food and Where Does it Come From?

   The term “wasted food” describes food that was not used for its
   intended purpose and is managed in a variety of ways, such as donation
   to feed people, creation of animal feed, composting, anaerobic
   digestion, or sending to landfills or combustion facilities. Examples
   include unsold food from retail stores; plate waste, uneaten prepared
   food, or kitchen trimmings from restaurants, cafeterias, and
   households; or by-products from food and beverage processing
   facilities. EPA uses the overarching term “wasted food” instead of
   “food waste” for food that was not used for its intended purpose
   because it conveys that a valuable resource is being wasted, whereas
   “food waste” implies that the food no longer has value and needs to be
   managed as waste.
     * Excess food refers to food that is recovered and donated to feed
       people.
     * Food waste refers to food such as plate waste (i.e., food that has
       been served but not eaten), spoiled food, or peels and rinds
       considered inedible that is sent to feed animals, to be composted
       or anaerobically digested, or to be landfilled or combusted with
       energy recovery.
     * Food loss refers to unused product from the agricultural sector,
       such as unharvested crops.

   EPA encourages anyone managing wasted food to reference the Food
   Recovery Hierarchy. When the higher levels of the hierarchy are no
   longer feasible, then the food waste left over should be put to
   beneficial use such as composted or sent to be broken down through
   anaerobic digestion. Additional resources on wasted food can be found
   at Further with Food: Center for Food Loss and Waste Solutions.Exit

Why is Sustainable Management of Food Important?

   Wasted food is a growing problem in our modern society and an untapped
   opportunity. In 2015 alone, more than 39 million tons of food waste was
   generated, with only 5.3 percent diverted from landfills and
   incinerators for composting. EPA estimates that more food reaches
   landfills and incinerators than any other single material in our
   everyday trash, constituting 22 percent of discarded municipal solid
   waste. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   estimates that in 2010, 31 percent or 133 billion pounds of the 430
   billion pounds of food produced was not available for human consumption
   at the retail and consumer levels (i.e., one-third of the food
   available was not eaten).^1

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   estimated in 2011 that approximately one-third of all food produced for
   human consumption worldwide is lost or wasted.^2 Taking simple steps in
   your everyday life can make a difference in addressing this issue.
   Reducing wasted food is a triple win; it's good for the economy, for
   communities, and for the environment.

Saving Money

   When we waste food, we’re not just creating a problem, we’re also
   missing an opportunity to save businesses and consumers money:
     * Pay Less for Trash Pickup – Organizations might pay less for trash
       pickup by keeping wasted food out of the garbage. Some haulers
       lower fees if wasted food is separated from the trash and sent to a
       compost facility instead of the landfill.
     * Receive Tax Benefits by Donating – If you donate healthy, safe, and
       edible food to hungry people, your organization can claim tax
       benefits. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act protects food donors
       from legal liability.
     * Waste Less and Spend Less – If you or your organization can find
       ways to prevent waste in the first place, you can spend less by
       buying only the food you will use. Preventing wasted food can also
       reduce energy and labor costs associated with throwing away good
       food.

   Top of Page

Helping People

   Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can
   help you make a difference in your community:
     * Feed People, Not Landfills – Instead of feeding landfills, we
       should be feeding people in our communities. You can donate a
       variety of foods to many different types of organizations. Contact
       Feeding America Exit or your local food rescue organizations for
       information about where you can donate and what types of food your
       local organization is able to accept.
     * Feed Children – In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
       National School Lunch Program provided nutritionally balanced,
       low-cost or free lunches to more than 31 million children each
       school day.^4 By redirecting food that would otherwise be wasted to
       homes and schools, we can help feed our country’s children.
     * Create Job Opportunities – Recovering and recycling wasted food
       through donation, salvaging, processing, industrial reuse, and
       composting strengthens infrastructure and creates jobs. Food
       recycling in these sectors employs more than 36,000 people,
       supporting local economies and promoting innovation.^5
     * Feed the World – According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
       of the United Nations, from 2012 to 2014 there were about 805
       million hungry people on earth. They predict that by eliminating
       food loss and wasted food we would have enough food to feed all the
       chronically undernourished. They also expect that we wouldn’t have
       to increase food production or put additional pressure on our
       natural resources to do so.^3

Conserving Resources

   Reducing wasted food does great things for the environment:
     * Reduce Methane from Landfills – When food goes to the landfill,
       it’s similar to tying food in a plastic bag. The nutrients in the
       food never return to the soil. The wasted food rots and produces
       methane gas.
     * Save Resources – Wasted food wastes the water, gasoline, energy,
       labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers used to make the food.
       When we throw food in the trash, we’re throwing away much more than
       food.
     * ​Return Nutrients to the Soil – If you can’t prevent, reduce or
       donate wasted food, you can compost. By sending food scraps to a
       composting facility instead of to a landfill or composting at home,
       you’re helping make healthy soils. Adding compost to gardens,
       highway construction sites, and poor soils makes great things
       happen. Properly composted organics (wasted food and yard waste)
       improve soil health and structure, improve water retention, support
       more native plants, and reduce the need for fertilizers and
       pesticides.

   2017. 28 percent is from electricity, 29 percent is from
   transportation, 22 percent is from industry, 12 percent is from
   commercial and residential, and 9 percent is from agriculture. Total
   Emissions in 2017 = 6,457 Million Metric Tons of CO[2] equivalent.
   Percentages may not add up to 100% due to independent rounding.

   emissions, not included in total above. All emission estimates from the
   Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.
   Larger image to save or printGreenhouse gases trap heat and make the
   planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the
   increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150
   years.^1 The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human
   activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for
   electricity, heat, and transportation.

   EPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing the Inventory of U.S.
   Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. This annual report estimates the
   total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with
   human activities across the United States.

   The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States
   are:
     * Transportation (28.9 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) –
       The transportation sector generates the largest share of greenhouse
       gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation
       primarily come from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks,
       ships, trains, and planes. Over 90 percent of the fuel used for
       transportation is petroleum based, which includes primarily
       gasoline and diesel.^2
     * Electricity production (27.5 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas
       emissions) – Electricity production generates the second largest
       share of greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 62.9 percent of
       our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and
       natural gas.^3
     * Industry (22.2 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) –
       Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning
       fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from
       certain chemical reactions necessary to produce goods from raw
       materials.
     * Commercial and Residential (11.6 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas
       emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and homes
       arise primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of
       certain products that contain greenhouse gases, and the handling of
       waste.
     * Agriculture (9.0 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) –
       Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such
       as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.
     * Land Use and Forestry (offset of 11.1 percent of 2017 greenhouse
       gas emissions) – Land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO[2] from
       the atmosphere) or a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the
       United States, since 1990, managed forests and other lands have
       absorbed more CO[2] from the atmosphere than they emit.

Emissions and Trends

   Since 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 1.3
   percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes
   in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2017, U.S.
   greenhouse gas emissions decreased compared to 2016 levels. The
   decrease in CO[2] emissions from fossil fuel combustion was a result of
   multiple factors, including a continued shift from coal to natural gas,
   increased use of renewables in the electric power sector, and milder
   weather that contributed to less overall electricity use.

   Line graph showing total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions for 1990 to
   2017. Total emissions increased from about 6,400 million metric tons of
   carbon dioxide equivalents in 1990 to over 7,000 million in 1998, and
   decreased to around 6,500 million in 2017. All emission estimates from
   the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.

Electricity Sector Emissions

   Pie chart of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by economic sector in
   2017. 28 percent is from electricity, 29 percent is from
   transportation, 22 percent is from industry, 12 percent is from
   commercial and residential, and 9 percent is from agriculture. Total
   Emissions in 2017 = 6,457 Million Metric Tons of CO[2] equivalent.
   Percentages may not add up to 100% due to independent rounding.

   sink and offsets approximately 11 percent of these greenhouse gas
   emissions, not included in total above. All emission estimates from the
   Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.
   Larger image to save or printThe Electricity sector involves the
   generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Carbon
   dioxide (CO[2]) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions
   from the sector, but smaller amounts of methane (CH[4]) and nitrous
   oxide (N[2]O) are also emitted. These gases are released during the
   combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to
   produce electricity. Less than 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions
   from the sector come from sulfur hexafluoride (SF[6]), an insulating
   chemical used in electricity transmission and distribution equipment.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Electricity Sector by Fuel Source

   Coal combustion is more carbon intensive than burning natural gas or
   petroleum for electricity. Although coal use accounted for about 67.9
   percent of CO[2] emissions from the sector, it represented only 31.2
   percent of the electricity generated in the United States in 2017.
   Natural gas use accounted for 31.2 percent of electricity generation in
   2017, and petroleum use accounted for less than one percent. The
   remaining generation in 2017 came from non-fossil fuel sources,
   including nuclear (21.0 percent) and renewable energy sources (16.2
   percent), which include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind, and solar.^1
   Most of these non-fossil sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind,
   and solar, are non-emitting.

Emissions and Trends

   In 2017, the electricity sector was the second largest source of U.S.
   greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 27.5 percent of the U.S.
   total. Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity have decreased by
   about 5.2 percent since 1990 due to a shift in generation to lower- and
   non-emitting sources of electricity generation and an increase in
   end-use energy efficiency.

   Line graph of greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector for
   1990 to 2017. Emissions started around 1,800 million metric tons of
   carbon dioxide equivalents in 1990, peaked at nearly 2,500 million in
   2007, and fell to about 1,775 million in 2017. All emission estimates
   from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks:
   1990–2017.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Electricity End-Use

   Pie chart showing total U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector with
   Electricity Distributed. 31 percent is from Residential and Commercial,
   30 percent is from industry, 29 percent is from transportation, and 10
   percent is from agriculture. All emission estimates from the Inventory
   of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.
   Larger image to save or printElectricity is used by other sectors—in
   homes, businesses, and factories. Therefore, it is possible to
   attribute the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation to
   the sectors that use the electricity. Looking at greenhouse gas
   emissions by end-use sector can help us understand energy demand across
   sectors and changes in energy use over time.

   When emissions from electricity are allocated to energy end-use
   sectors, industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S.
   greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and
   residential buildings also increase substantially when emissions from
   electricity end-use are included, due to the relatively large share of
   electricity use (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning;
   lighting; and appliances) in these sectors.

Reducing Emissions from Electricity

   There are a variety of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
   associated with electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.
   The table below categorizes these opportunities and provides examples.
   For a more comprehensive list, see Chapter 7 of the Contribution of
   Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.^2

   CAPTION: Example Reduction Opportunities for the Electricity Sector

   Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples
   Increased Efficiency of Fossil-fired Power Plants and Fuel Switching
   Increasing the efficiency of existing fossil fuel-fired power plants by
   using advanced technologies; substituting less carbon-intensive fuels;
   shifting generation from higher-emitting to lower-emitting power
   plants.
     * Converting a coal-fired boiler to use of natural gas, or co-firing
       natural gas.
     * Converting a single-cycle gas turbine into a combined-cycle
       turbine.
     * Shifting dispatch of electric generators to lower-emitting units or
       power plants.

   Renewable Energy Using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuel
   to generate electricity. Increasing the share of total electricity
   generated from wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal sources, as well as
   certain biofuel sources, through the addition of new renewable energy
   generating capacity.
   Increased End-Use Energy Efficiency Reducing electricity use and peak
   demand by increasing efficiency and conservation in homes, businesses,
   and industry. EPA's ENERGY STAR® partners removed over 290 million
   metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2017 alone, and helped Americans
   save over $30 billion in energy costs, approximately 370 billion kWh of
   electricity.
   Nuclear Energy Generating electricity from nuclear energy rather than
   the combustion of fossil fuels. Extending the life of existing nuclear
   plants and building new nuclear generating capacity.
   Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Capturing CO[2] as a byproduct
   of fossil fuel combustion before it enters the atmosphere, transporting
   the CO[2], injecting the CO[2] deep underground at a carefully selected
   and suitable subsurface geologic formation where it is securely stored.
   Capturing CO[2] from the stacks of a coal-fired power plant and then
   transferring the CO[2] via pipeline, injecting the CO[2] deep
   underground at a carefully selected and suitable nearby abandoned oil
   field where it is securely stored . Learn more about CCS.

   Larger image to save or printThe Transportation sector includes the
   movement of people and goods by cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes,
   and other vehicles. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from
   transportation are carbon dioxide (CO[2]) emissions resulting from the
   combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal
   combustion engines. The largest sources of transportation-related
   greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars and light-duty trucks,
   including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans. These
   sources account for over half of the emissions from the transportation
   sector. The remaining greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation
   sector come from other modes of transportation, including freight
   trucks, commercial aircraft, ships, boats, and trains, as well as
   pipelines and lubricants.

   Relatively small amounts of methane (CH[4]) and nitrous oxide (N[2]O)
   are emitted during fuel combustion. In addition, a small amount of
   hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions are included in the Transportation
   sector. These emissions result from the use of mobile air conditioners
   and refrigerated transport.

   In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation accounted for
   about 28.9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it
   the largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of
   the overall trend, from 1990 to 2017, total transportation emissions
   have increased due, in large part, to increased demand for travel. The
   number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by light-duty motor vehicles
   (passenger cars and light-duty trucks) increased by 45.9 percent from
   1990 to 2017, as a result of a confluence of factors including
   population growth, economic growth, urban sprawl, and periods of low
   fuel prices. Between 1990 and 2004, average fuel economy among new
   vehicles sold annually declined, as sales of light-duty trucks
   increased. Starting in 2005, average new vehicle fuel economy began to
   increase while light-duty VMT grew only modestly for much of the
   period. Average new vehicle fuel economy has improved almost every year
   since 2005, and the truck share is about 45 percent of new vehicles in
   model year 2016.

   fell to about 1,870 million in 2017. Emissions involved in the
   consumption of electricity for transportation activities are included
   above, but not shown separately (as was done for other sectors). These
   indirect emissions are negligible, accounting for less than 1 percent

   Larger image to save or printThe Industry sector produces the goods and
   raw materials we use every day. The greenhouse gases emitted during
   industrial production are split into two categories: direct emissions
   that are produced at the facility, and indirect emissions that occur
   off site, but are associated with the facility's use of electricity.

   Direct emissions are produced by burning fuel for power or heat,
   through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or
   equipment. Most direct emissions come from the consumption of fossil
   fuels for energy. A smaller amount of direct emissions, roughly one
   third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use
   of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make
   plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals,
   iron and steel, and cement.

   Indirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant
   to make electricity, which is then used by an industrial facility to
   power industrial buildings and machinery.

   More information about facility-level emissions from large industrial
   sources is available through EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program's
   data publication tool. National-level information about emissions from

Emissions and Trends

   In 2017, direct industrial greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 22.2
   percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the third
   largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, after the
   Transportation and Electricity sectors. Including both direct emissions
   and indirect emissions associated with electricity use, industry's
   share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 was 29.7 percent,
   making it the largest contributor of greenhouse gases of any sector.
   Greenhouse gas emissions from industry have declined by 11.8 percent
   since 1990.

   Line graph of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from
   industry for 1990 to 2017. There are three lines - for total emissions,
   direct emissions, and indirect emissions from electricity. All three
   lines generally trend downwards. All emission estimates from the
   Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.

Reducing Emissions from Industry

   There are a wide variety of industrial activities that cause greenhouse
   gas emissions, and many opportunities to reduce them. The table shown
   below provides some examples of opportunities for industry to reduce
   emissions. For a more comprehensive list, see Chapter 10 of the
   Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.^1Exit

   CAPTION: Examples of Reduction Opportunities for the Industry Sector

   Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples
   Energy Efficiency Upgrading to more efficient industrial technology.
   EPA's ENERGY STAR® program helps industries become more
   energy-efficient. Identifying the ways that manufacturers can use less
   energy to light and heat factories or to run equipment.
   Fuel Switching Switching to fuels that result in less CO[2] emissions
   but the same amount of energy, when combusted. Using natural gas
   instead of coal to run machinery.
   Recycling Producing industrial products from materials that are
   recycled or renewable, rather than producing new products from raw
   materials. Using scrap steel and scrap aluminum as opposed to smelting
   new aluminum or forging new steel.
   Training and Awareness Making companies and workers aware of the steps
   to reduce or prevent emissions leaks from equipment. EPA has a variety
   of voluntary programs that provide resources for training and other
   steps for reducing emissions. EPA supports programs for the aluminum,
   semiconductor, and magnesium industries. Instituting handling policies
   and procedures for perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
   and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) that reduce occurrences of accidental
   releases and leaks from containers and equipment.

   2017. 28 percent is from electricity, 29 percent is from
   transportation, 22 percent is from industry, 12 percent is from
   commercial and residential, and 9 percent is from agriculture. Total
   Emissions in 2017 = 6,457 Million Metric Tons of CO[2] equivalent.

   emissions, not included in total above. All emission estimates from the
   Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.
   Larger image to save or printThe residential and commercial sectors
   include all homes and commercial businesses (excluding agricultural and
   industrial activities). Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come
   from direct emissions including fossil fuel combustion for heating and
   cooking needs, management of waste and wastewater, and leaks from
   refrigerants in homes and businesses as well as indirect emissions that
   occur offsite but are associated with use of electricity consumed by
   homes and businesses.

   Direct emissions are produced from residential and commercial
   activities in a variety of ways:
     * Combustion of natural gas and petroleum products for heating and
       cooking needs emits carbon dioxide (CO[2]), methane (CH[4]), and
       nitrous oxide (N[2]O). Emissions from natural gas consumption
       represent 89.0 percent of the direct fossil fuel CO[2] emissions
       from the residential and commercial sectors. Coal consumption is a
       minor component of energy use in both of these sectors.
     * Organic waste sent to landfills emits CH[4].
     * Wastewater treatment plants emit CH[4] and N[2]O.
     * Fluorinated gases (mainly hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) used in air
       conditioning and refrigeration systems can be released during
       servicing or from leaking equipment.

   Indirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant
   to make electricity, which is then used in residential and commercial
   activities such as lighting and for appliances.

   More national-level information about emissions from the residential
   and commercial sectors can be found in the U.S. Inventory's Energy and
   Trends chapters.

Emissions and Trends

   In 2017, direct greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses
   accounted for 11.6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
   Greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses vary from year to
   year based on short-term fluctuations in energy consumption caused
   primarily by weather conditions. Total residential and commercial
   greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 have increased by 3.4 percent since
   1990. Greenhouse gas emissions from on-site direct emissions in homes
   and businesses have decreased by 3.2 percent since 1990. Additionally,
   indirect emissions from electricity use by homes and businesses have
   increased by 7.8 percent since 1990, due to increasing electricity
   consumption for lighting, heating, air conditioning, and appliances.

   Line graph of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from homes
   and businesses for 1990 to 2017. There are three lines - for total
   emissions, direct emissions, and indirect emissions from electricity.
   Total and indirect emissions trend upwards through 2007, after which
   they trend downwards; direct emissions stay roughly constant. All

   Commercial Sector

   Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples
   Homes and Commercial Buildings Reducing energy use through energy
   efficiency. Homes and commercial buildings use large amounts of energy
   for heating, cooling, lighting, and other functions. "Green building"
   techniques and retrofits can allow new and existing buildings to use
   less energy to accomplish the same functions, leading to fewer
   greenhouse gas emissions. Techniques to improve building energy
   efficiency include better insulation; more energy-efficient heating,
   cooling, ventilation, and refrigeration systems; efficient fluorescent
   lighting; passive heating and lighting to take advantage of sunlight;
   and the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and electronics. Learn
   more about ENERGY STAR®.
   Wastewater Treatment Making water and wastewater systems more
   energy-efficient. Drinking water and wastewater systems account for
   approximately 2 percent of energy use in the United States. By
   incorporating energy efficiency practices into their water and
   wastewater plant, municipalities and utilities can save 15 to 30
   percent in energy use. Learn more about Energy Efficiency for Water and
   Wastewater Utilities.
   Waste Management Reducing solid waste sent to landfills. Capturing and
   using methane produced in current landfills. Landfill gas is the
   natural byproduct of the decomposition of solid waste in landfills. It
   primarily consists of CO[2] and CH[4]. Well established, low-cost
   methods to reduce greenhouse gases from consumer waste exist, including
   recycling programs, waste reduction programs, and landfill methane
   capture programs.
     * Learn about EPA's waste reduction and resource conservation
       efforts.
     * Learn about EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program, which promotes
       the recovery and use of landfill gas.

   Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Reducing leakage from air
   conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Using refrigerants with lower
   global warming potentials. Commonly used refrigerants in homes and
   businesses include ozone-depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)
   refrigerants, often HCFC-22, and blends consisting entirely or
   primarily of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), both of which are potent
   greenhouse gases. In recent years there have been several advancements
   in air conditioning and refrigeration technology that can help food
   retailers reduce both refrigerant charges and refrigerant emissions.

   Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2017.
   Larger image to save or printAgricultural activities — crop and
   livestock production for food — contribute to emissions in a variety of
   ways:
     * Various management practices on agricultural soils can lead to
       increased availability of nitrogen in the soil and result in
       emissions of nitrous oxide (N[2]O). Specific activities that
       contribute to N[2]O emissions from agricultural lands include the
       application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, the growth of
       nitrogen-fixing crops, the drainage of organic soil, and irrigation
       practices. Management of agricultural soils accounts for almost
       half of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.*
     * Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce methane (
       CH[4]) as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is
       called enteric fermentation, and it represents almost one third of
       the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.
     * The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes
       to CH[4] and N[2]O emissions. Different manure treatment and
       storage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are
       produced. Manure management accounts for about 14 percent of the
       total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture economic sector
       in the United States.
     * Smaller sources of agricultural emissions include CO[2] from liming
       and urea application, CH[4] from rice cultivation, and burning crop
       residues, which produces CH[4] and N[2]O.

   More national-level information about emissions from agriculture can be
   found in the agriculture chapter in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse
   Gas Emissions and Sinks.

   * Management of croplands and grasslands can also lead to emissions or
   sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO[2]). However, these emissions and
   removals are included under the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry
   sector.

Emissions and Trends

   In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture economic sector
   accounted for 9.0 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
   Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have increased by 8.8 percent
   since 1990. One driver for this increase has been the 57.1 percent
   growth in combined CH[4] and N[2]O emissions from livestock manure
   management systems, reflecting the increased use of emission-intensive
   liquid systems over this time period. Emissions from other agricultural
   sources have either remained flat or changed by a relatively small
   amount since 1990.

   CAPTION: Examples of Reduction Opportunities for the Agriculture Sector

   Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples
   Land and Crop Management Adjusting the methods for managing land and
   growing crops.
     * Fertilizing crops with the appropriate amount of nitrogen required
       for optimal crop production, since over-application of nitrogen can
       lead to higher N[2]O emissions without enhancing crop production.
     * Draining water from wetland rice soils during the growing season to
       reduce CH[4] emissions.

   Livestock Management Adjusting feeding practices and other management
   methods to reduce the amount of CH[4] resulting from enteric
   fermentation.
     * Improving pasture quality to increase animal productivity, which
       can reduce the amount of CH[4] emitted per unit of animal product.
       Also, increased productivity in livestock can be introduced through
       improved breeding practices.

   Manure Management
     * Controlling the way in which manure decomposes to reduce N[2]O and
       CH[4] emissions.
     * Capturing CH[4] from manure decomposition to produce renewable
       energy.

     * Handling manure as a solid or depositing it on pasture rather than
       storing it in a liquid-based system such as a lagoon. This would
       likely reduce CH[4] emissions but may increase N[2]O emissions.
     * Storing manure in anaerobic containment areas to maximize CH[4]
       production and then capturing the CH[4] to use as an energy
       substitute for fossil fuels.
     * For more information, see EPA's AgSTAR Program, a voluntary
       outreach and education program that promotes recovery and use of
       methane from animal manure.

Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Sector Emissions and Sequestration

   Plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO[2]) from the atmosphere as they grow,
   and they store some of this carbon as aboveground and belowground
   biomass throughout their lifetime. Soils and dead organic matter/litter
   can also store some of the carbon from these plants depending on how
   the soil is managed and other environmental conditions (e.g., climate).
   This storage of carbon in plants, dead organic matter/litter and soils
   is called biological carbon sequestration. Because biological
   sequestration takes CO[2] out of the atmosphere and stores it in these
   carbon pools, it is also called a carbon "sink."

   Emissions or sequestration of CO[2], as well as emissions of CH[4] and
   N[2]O can occur from management of lands in their current use or as
   lands are converted to other land uses. Carbon dioxide is exchanged
   between the atmosphere and the plants and soils on land, for example,
   as cropland is converted into grassland, as lands are cultivated for
   crops, or as forests grow. In addition, using biological feedstocks
   (such as energy crops or wood) for purposes such as electricity
   generation, as inputs to processes that create liquid fuels, or as
   building materials can lead to emissions or sequestration.*

   In the United States overall, since 1990, Land Use, Land-Use Change,
   and Forestry (LULUCF) activities have resulted in more removal of CO[2]
   from the atmosphere than emissions. Because of this, the LULUCF sector
   in the United States is considered a net sink, rather than a source, of
   CO[2] over this time-period. In many areas of the world, the opposite
   is true, particularly in countries where large areas of forest land are
   cleared, often for conversion to agricultural purposes or for
   settlements. In these situations, the LULUCF sector can be a net source
   of greenhouse gas emissions.
     * More national-level information about land use, land-use change,
       and forestry is available from the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and
       Forestry chapter in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
       and Sinks. More information on emissions and sequestration from
       forest land and urban trees in settlement areas, see also the USFS
       Resource Update. Exit
     * For more information about global emissions from land use and
       forestry activities, see EPA's Global Greenhouse Gas emissions page
       and the Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment
       Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Exit

   * Emissions and sequestration from carbon stocks are presented under
   the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector in the
   Inventory. Other emissions from methane (CH[4]) and nitrous oxide
   (N[2]O) are also presented in the Energy sector.

Emissions and Trends

   In 2017, the net CO[2] removed from the atmosphere from the LULUCF
   sector offset 11.1 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
   Between 1990 and 2017, total carbon sequestration in the LULUCF sector
   decreased by 11.5 percent, primarily due to a decrease in the rate of
   net carbon accumulation in forests and cropland, as well as an increase
   in CO[2] emissions from urbanization.

   Line graph of carbon emissions and removals from land use, land use
   change, and forestry for 1990 to 2017. There are three lines – for
   gross emissions, carbon sinks, and net emissions. All three lines
   generally trend upwards. *Note: The LULUCF sector is a net "sink" of
   emissions in the United States (e.g., more greenhouse gas emissions are
   sequestered than emitted from land use activities), so net greenhouse
   gas emissions from LULUCF are negative.

6,457 million metric tons of CO[2] equivalent – what does that mean?

An Explanation of Units

   A million metric tons is equal to about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1
   trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little
   more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same
   mass as 1 million small cars!

   The U.S. Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability
   with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is a little bit
   larger (about 10 percent) than a U.S. "short" ton.

   Greenhouse gas emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO[2])
   equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO[2] equivalent, its
   emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP).
   The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective
   at warming Earth than CO[2], per unit mass.

   The GWP values appearing in the Emissions Web pages reflect the values
   used in the U.S. Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC's Second
   Assessment Report (SAR). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate
   of greenhouse gas emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the U.S.
   Inventory and the IPCC's discussion on GWPs. Exit
