Dragon Fun!

   [20190816_120620.jpg]
   We are going to have so much Fun with Friends at Storytime with these
   Five Baby Dragons.  I saw these by Jessica @ Storytime in the Stacks
   and wanted a set of my own. Her rhyme is adorable! Any chance to blow
   bubbles or kisses is fine by me. I jazzed my set up by adding glitter
   glue and a tail on my dragons. We have several fun dragon books to use
   as well as my 10 dragons from a previous post  HERE.  Right now I have
   NO plans to make a Mama dragon but...I might in the future! LOL!  I'm
   sure these cuties will make return appearances in storytime. Be sure to
   check out the Flannel Friday Pinterest boards for more
   fairytale/dragon/medieval/royal inspiration!

Astronauts in Space!

   [20190624_190010.jpg]
   I love my new set of colorful astronauts! I used an adaptation of the
   song, One Elephant Went out to Play. Here's a link for the rhyme I
   used; Five Astronauts Went Up in Space.  I copied Amanda's astronaut on
   Mr. Keith's blogpost Here.  I love how they turned out!! They were
   tedious and halfway through I was tempted to stop at 5 but I'm so glad
   I did the ten. With a small group the kiddos can help put the
   astronauts on or take them off the board. They love that!  It's hard to
   tell in the pic but they have shiny glitter glue 'knobs' on their front
   panel. The red astronaut has a glitter felt face shield since I didn't
   have an alternate color to use for that.  These astronauts made
   storytime out-of-this-world Fun with Friends!

Space Friends!

   [20190806_130401%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
   We're winding down our Summer Reading space adventure but I wanted to
   share this Rhyme/Story flannelboard set.  I used some pieces I already
   had and added the rocket and made up a new story/rhyme that used them
   all!
   Here's the link for Space Friends.
   My rocket was inspired by Mr. Keith at felt-tastic Flannelboard Fun
   Time!! I had already posted about Astronaut Amy Here!  We have had so
   much Fun with Friends at Storytime this summer!

Ready for Writing!

   [5%2Bpencils%2Bpic.jpg]
   [51bj5xnZR2L._SX452_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg]
   Time for a new-for-me theme for storytime! I made a set of Five Little
   Pencils. Here's a link for the rhyme that I made up to go along with my
   pencils - Five Little Pencils.  I used a Google image as my pattern and
   added some fabric paint and glitter glue and googly eyes. The 'paper'
   is white felt with blue acrylic paint lines. I used masking tape to
   keep my lines straight and as narrow as possible. This set makes me
   smile!  We're having so much Fun with Friends at Storytime!

Airplanes Flying Away!

   Up, up and away with Five Little Airplanes! We played 'Which One Flew
   Away?' after we did the rhyme. I had one little guy that exclaimed when
   I put the airplanes on the board, "There's a honey mustard plane!"
   That's why I love doing preschool storytime. Airplanes are so much Fun
   with Friends at Storytime.

  Kisses for Valentine's Day

   [20190114_145438.jpg]
   Here's an oldie but goodie for Valentine's Day. I found this rhyme
   years ago on Story Time Secret's blog. I decided to make some smoochy
   lips and add some kissing sounds as I say the rhyme! Here's a printable
   doc of Five Little Kisses.
   Blowing kisses is a lot of Fun with Friends at Storytime!

Babies in a Stroller going for a Ride!

   [20190114_180810.jpg]
   Oh my! I just love my sweet babies riding in the giant stroller! These
   little cuties make me smile. I have a rhyme I made up to justify making
   this set and we will be using them this month at storytime.
     5 Babies in the Stroller.
   [20190106_195956.jpg]
   [bookcover.php?id=ils:415247&amp;size=medium&amp;category=&amp;format=B
   ook&amp;isn=0439546516] I have several different posts about babies
   HERE,but this is the first time having them in a stroller with
   different weather conditions! They turned out better than I had hoped
   which is always a good thing.  I used a Google image that I
   deconstructed and tweaked a little for the babies and I loosely adapted
   a stroller image to make my own pattern (free hand cut out) stroller
   with diecut circle wheels. Babies are so much Fun with Friends at
   Storytime!
