   Between love and madness lies… parenthood.

Well, Hello again!

   I think it’s been forever.

   Like if forever was a quantifiable number, it would amount to the time
   I haven’t been here. But don’t worry- I am back!

   Life happened and unfortunately blogging got pushed to the back burner
   and I’m totally ashamed of that!

   So what has happened in the past however long it’s been since there was
   a post that wasn’t a product review?

   Phew, where do I even begin!

   Gabe was (obviously) born (9/2017) and from the get go had what feels
   like a billion medical issues. Poor kid has been through the wringer!
   Dairy allergy, eczema, other food/environmental allergies but oh boy
   none of that dulled his spunk. He is 100% a wild child and definitely
   added some more laughter to the clan here.
   [img_9720.jpg?w=760&#038;h=1013]

   Cayden completed Kindergarten and is now heading into 1st grade. Landed
   his first ER visit with his first injury (luckily the could glue it and
   we were able to skate by without stitches) to start off his summer. Too
   smart for his own good and getting way too big! He is such an amazing
   kiddo and trust me, he’s going places! [img_9860.jpg?w=760]

   Danny is following in the footsteps of his Opa and is now a beekeeper!
   I must say, he’s ROCKING it! THIS is what he was made to do. His summer
   is ending with back surgery to fix some pain and numbness issues he’s
   been having consistently for a few years now. But it won’t put him down
   long and hopefully he will be able to fully enjoy life and things he
   used to love after!

   [img_8530.jpg?w=760]

   Me… I turned out quaint little secluded home into a mini-farm. 12
   chickens, 2 goats and a potbelly pig, pumpkins, blueberries,
   blackberries and elderberries. [img_9322.jpg?w=760&#038;h=1013]
   [img_9172.jpg?w=760&#038;h=1012] Soon we will be adding turkeys, meat
   pigs and hopefully a calf in the spring. Aside from BurritoBuzz, I
   snagged my dream job with Mason Bottle, and just enjoying life a day at
   a time.

   Sorry I was gone, but I promise you I am back.

Must-Haves for Weekly Game Nights

   Published on November 28, 2018November 28, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   We’ve brought you quite a few must-haves for 2018 but why stop there?!

   Cayden’s new and recent thing is “can we play a board game?”… I have
   absolutely no problem saying “absolutely” every night he asks because
   at this age, anything keeping him off of electronics is a win in my
   book.

   We’ve been circling between Pop The Pig, Build or Boom, Diggin’ Dino
   Bones and The Baby Beluga Game. The first two are pretty main stream
   games but the last two, man, if you haven’t heard about them, I’m here
   to tell you they are must-haves!

   Diggin’ Dino Bones

   Diggin’ Dino Bones is a puzzle game in which you “dig” through dirt
   cards in hopes of finding your dinosaurs pieces and you have the be the
   first to (correctly) assemble your dinosaur skeleton.
   [img_3269.jpg?w=760] [img_3270.jpg?w=760] [img_3271.jpg?w=760]
   [img_3272.jpg?w=760] [img_3273.jpg?w=760]

   The game includes:

   1 Game Board

   36 Dinosaur Cards

   8 Dirt Cards

   8 Action Cards

   Rules

   In all honesty? The board is pointless. The puzzles don’t look like the
   dinosaurs on the board and you don’t utilize the board for anything. It
   just took up space we needed on the table to build our puzzles.

   The Baby Beluga Game

   In this game, you win by working together- not competing against one
   another. [img_4868.jpg?w=760]

   If the name sounds familiar, you must be a Raffi fan! The Baby Beluga
   Game was created, cooperatively, by Raffi and fair-trade, indie game
   developer Suzanne Lyons of CooperativeGames.com. It features paintings
   by Ashley Wolff, who illustrated Raffi’s Baby Beluga book, and comes
   with a free download of the Baby Beluga song and a 32-page illustrated
   booklet.

   I LOVE that this game teaches children that you can win by working as a
   team and not necessarily outdoing and out-powering others ! The goal of
   the game is to help Baby Beluga swim free, while finding out about
   oceans and whales along the way. There may be trouble, but again- work
   WITH your friends to find the solutions and set Baby Beluga free!

Reindeer In Here

   Published on November 28, 2018 by KirstynVelez- www.BurritoBuzz.com1
   Comment

   Move over Elf on the Shelf- there is a new tradition in town! Reindeer
   In Here has replaced the late night mess making elf, the alarms in your
   phone labeled “move elf” (don’t ask me how I know these exist) and the
   “don’t touch or [it] will lose its magic”. [img_4870.jpg?w=760]

   Adam Reed released Reindeer In Here when he couldn’t find a Christmas
   tradition that fit the bill of what he was wanting. While yes, there is
   Elf on the Shelf, but like stated already above- stressful stressful
   stressful and NOT what the Reed Family wanted for their kids. So
   Reindeer In Here was born.

   It is sold as a plush and book gift set and the story is precious! The
   reindeer has antlers that are different lengths to teach children that
   different is okay! The reindeer is meant to be the first gift sent from
   Santa and unlike Elf on the Shelf, children are ENCOURAGED to take the
   reindeer with them everywhere so that it can “learn” about each child’s
   uniqueness. While Elf on the Shelf spies on children, Reindeer In Here
   encourages the children to confide in their reindeer so that Santa can
   get to know them better. The reindeer “writes” letters back to Santa
   nightly (no real letters need to be written) and children place the
   reindeer under the tree on Christmas Eve for Santa to take back to the
   North Pole with him.

   [img_4874.jpg?w=760]

   Honestly, this is the best tradition you could start and seeing as how
   Reindeer In Here has over 9 awards and has been named the 2018 Most
   Awarded Holiday Tradition Brand I’d think it’s safe to say- you won’t
   be disappointed. [img_4871.jpg?w=760] [img_4872.jpg?w=760]
   [img_4873.jpg?w=760]

   Price wise the gift set will run you $32.99 on Amazon or $29.99 in
   local retail stores. Elf on the Shelf runs $29.99 and up as well so the
   pricing is definitely comparable.

   [img_4875.jpg?w=760]

   Find yours in a local store near you and start your new family
   tradition!

Pop-Oh-Ver Playset Review

   Published on October 30, 2018October 30, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   Kids love to pretend. Playing with pretend kitchens and pretend food
   seems like its a milestone for all children. The problem is, those big
   bulky play kitchens. They never match the decor, they take up tons of
   space and they’re just overall bulky and cumbersome.  Pop-Oh-Ver is
   here to change that. Pop-Oh-Ver playsets turn any ordinary (sturdy)
   dining room chair into a kitchen (or countertop) play set. It’s pretty
   simple, pretty innovative and overall pretty much a game changer in the
   imagination world. [img_4274.jpg?w=760]

   We received the counter top, the stove top, the baking food set, the
   fruits and vegetables, the pretend food set, the pots and pans and the
   master chef set and it has kept Cayden and Gabriel busy for hours!

   Assembly was…well, not as easy as I was thinking. The box shows it in 8
   steps and while this is accurate it’s not as simple as it’s depicted.
   It took me a few tries to get it straights and on there correctly.
   [img_4275-1.jpg?w=760]

   The counter top set features a shelf for storage and a “blender”. The
   stove set features a microwave door and over door which “open and
   close” and has “knobs”. While you can’t place anything in the oven, it
   still allows for pretend play with the door. Storage is easy as the
   items fold up but I have never been able to get them back into their
   box. The food is soft and great quality and the pots and pans are food
   grade stainless steel. [img_4276.jpg?w=760]

   The play sets run $39.95 while the accessories run between $19.95-29.95
   depending on the set you purchase.

   Overall, 4 out of 5. I think the price is a little higher then I would
   be willing to pay, but the quality and concept-it’s really good.

SnoofyBee Showdown: Real vs. Fake

   Published on May 30, 2018 by KirstynVelez- www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a
   comment

   …and we’re back.

   2 years ago, Casey did our initial review of the SnoofyBee in which she
   happily gave it a 5 out of 5 stars. When SnoofyBee reached out again
   and informed us that knockoff companies are using their pictures to
   promote and market their :ahem: less than fantastic product, I agreed
   to not only (re)review the SnoofyBee, but agreed to review the knockoff
   product and again provide a true, honest review and opinion.

   This is a true knockOUT product versus knockOFF product. Let’s be real
   here, SnoofyBee was a knockout the second they launched their
   Kickstarter because it was the answer to everything a parent needed for
   diaper changes. There really is no comparison between the two.

**For the ease of the review, the REAL SnoofyBee is on the top or on the left
in the pictures**

   Packaging: SnoofyBee comes in a typical package but the product itself
   has a wrap on it with info, scannable QR code and pictures of cute
   babies. The knockoff has nothing. No instructions, no pictures that
   show you how it might work, and the zipper on the plastic bag broke so
   I couldn’t even unzip it and had to resort to just cutting it out of
   there.  1525966595084

   Barrier: So the ENTIRE point of the product is to keep your child
   occupied and keep their hands out of their dirty diaper area. Both
   products achieved this but for VERY different reasons. The SnoofyBee’s
   barrier is rigid (yet still soft and padded) and when Velcroed shut,
   stands up on its own thus keeping Gabe’s hand out of his diaper area.
   The knockoff has ZERO stability and kept Gabe’s hand out of his diaper
   area because he was too busy trying to remove the product from his face
   as it collapsed. It offered NO rigidity an it’s also not adjustable.
   The SnoofyBee has adjustable Velcro while the knockoff only offered it
   to stick together in one location.

   1525966632008

   Toy Hooks: Gabe’s favorite “busy” toy is his Nuby keys. These do not
   have a split ring as you can see. The SnoofyBee offers attached toy
   rings with a split to be able to literally put any toy on there. The
   knockoff, I would have to purchase a separate ring in order to attach
   97% of toys to it seeing as how all they offer is a completely closed D
   ring with no way to attach anything to it.

   1525966677936

   Strap: Both offer a carrying strap but the quality is drastically
   different. SnoofyBee has a thicker strap and buckle that just overall
   feels stronger and more stable.

   1525966713892

   Length and Width: While the knockoff product tops the SnoofyBee for
   overall length and width, the SnoofyBee offers more useable space since
   the barrier is attached differently. This allows for more adjustment
   when it comes to being able to grow with your child. When folded
   completely closed, the SnoofyBee is more compact and I was able to put
   it into my diaper bag with more ease.

   1525966782890 1525966860211

   Price: While the SnoofyBee comes in at $29.99 and the knockoff you can
   snag anywhere between $14.99-18.99, its a true “you get what you pay
   for” type ordeal. People are purchasing the knockoff and then
   purchasing the Snoofybee because the pictures are deceiving and the
   product people THINK they’re receiving isn’t what they ARE receiving.

   Screen Shot 2018-05-30 at 9.36.40 AM

   You can clearly see in the below image that the knockoff has utilized
   the images from SnoofyBee to try to market their own product when in
   actuality, their product doesn’t amount to or offer the same attributes
   as the SnoofyBee.
   Screen Shot 2018-05-30 at 9.32.11 AM
   Screen Shot 2018-05-29 at 10.46.58 AM
   Screen Shot 2018-05-29 at 10.46.03 AM
   Screen Shot 2018-05-29 at 10.46.28 AM

   Again, no comparison between the two.

Have you tried the SnoofyBee or the knockoff brand? What do you think?

   Until next time.

   Screen Shot 2018-05-30 at 10.13.38 AM

I received a full-sized product for the purpose of review and in
consideration for my true, honest opinion. No compensation was received in
exchange for a positive review.

Virtuoso Bear: Sonatas, Concertos and Symphonies OH MY! {Review, Discount Code
& Giveaway}

   Published on May 15, 2018May 15, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.com6 Comments

   Since G was a little tiny guy, we have always softly played classical
   music in the background during any time of sleep. It started off with a
   mixed YouTube compilation, in which I quickly noticed my favorite and
   promptly bought it on iTunes. img_3017 We now listen to Clarinet
   Concerto in A Major, K. 622 nearly every night during our bedtime
   routine and it helps Gabe wind down for the night (thank you, Mozart!)
   Which is exactly why we were super exited to review the new Virtuoso
   Bear by Vosego. They come in two styles, Ludwig and Amadeus. (You can
   snag your own with a 20% discount through Amazon using
   code 9YIMZ7P4 until 7/20!)

   So now, instead of my trusty iPhone, Gabe has his new friend, Amadeus!
   The Vosego Virtuoso Bear is a soft, snuggly, soothing friend for just
   about any aged child. Each bear, Amadeus or Ludwig, comes dressed in
   era typical clothing, with battery operated music boxes tucked inside
   their tummies. Each bear plays 40 min of sonatas, concertos and
   symphonies written by their respective composers.
   [img_2467.jpg?w=291&#038;h=389]

   Music is turned easily on and off by a battery pack nestled inside
   their tummy. The bear requires (3) AAA batteries, which are secured by
   a screw, so even if the child could figure out how to remove the
   battery/sound pack, they wouldn’t be able to get to the actual
   batteries. You can adjust/change the volume or track without having to
   remove the box! Double click to change the track and hold the button
   down to adjust the volume. I love that we don’t have to assemble and
   dismantle every time!

   The outer part of each bear is washable (you just have to remove the
   battery/sound pack) and then hand wash it. The eyes and nose are
   embroidered on (hallelujah!) so they don’t pose a choking hazard for
   little ones that the hard ones do!

   You can buy either bear on Amazon and they retail for $49.99.


   beethoven_ludwig_bear
   mozart-amadesu_bear

   They are available in Ludwig and Amadeus. You can use code 9YIMZ7P4 on
   either bear for 20% off!

   These bears are a great gift for anyone and are “aged” from 0+. They
   would make a great baby shower present for any Mom-to-Be!

Want to win your own?

Maze-O {Review & Giveaway}

   Published on April 23, 2018April 24, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.com3 Comments

   As a mom to a child with what seems to be 100,000 useless annoying
   noise making toys, I always swoon over interactive STEM toys that not
   only challenge small minds alike, but they don’t require batteries or
   electronics. I love activity type toys that keep C intrigued and
   interested.

   The Maze-O starter set was a toy fitting that bill. It is suitable for
   ages starting around 2 and when asked the best age, the CEO stated
   “young children, starting around age 2 can begin to put pieces
   together. By 3-4 years old they can be deliberate about forming
   passageways and branches that lead to dead-ends or exits. By age 5-6
   children can follow the included instruction cards to form complex
   mazes and creat their own complex mazes with tricky passageways”…and
   she’s right! While Cayden is (barely) 5, he was able to look at the
   card and follow the colored instructions on how to build the maze on
   it. He then thoroughly enjoyed driving his hot wheels cars through said
   maze and then promptly destroying it and finding another card to
   follow.

   Included in the starter set is a deck of cards with instructions for
   30+ mazes, plus 5 different types of tiles. The tiles are brightly
   colored and fit together without much effort.
   [img_2538.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300] [img_2539.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300]
   [img_2540.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300]

   The Maze-O set was a huge hit here. Cayden loves to build, loves mazes
   and this product is truthfully the best of both worlds. Price wise,
   you’re looking at just under $30 which is reasonable for such a high
   quality toy. You can find Maze-O on Amazon or in Barnes and Noble book
   stores.

   Overall, 5 out of 5.

   Now for the best part! Win your very own Maze-O Starter Set! All you
   have to do is comment below for your entry! A random winner will be
   chosen on May 5th, 2018 at 10pm CST. The giveaway is open to all US
   residents ages 18+.

Sealy Soybean Comfort 3-Sided Contour Diaper Changing Pad {Review}

   Published on April 14, 2018April 16, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   There are little things that us as parents tend to obsess over, and I
   found for me it was where I was going to change Gabe’s diaper. Cayden
   had a changing table that we [DEL: never :DEL] used so I didn’t figure
   we would get one for G. When Kolcraft reached out to review a changing
   pad, I knew I had to jump on the opportunity.

   [img_2452.jpg?w=760]

   This particular changing pad is a life saver. It has deeper, taller
   sides to help contain those wriggly babies that try to do everything
   but lay still while you’re changing their diapers and while you should
   never leave baby unattended on a changing table, high surface, etc. it
   helps give a sense of comfort.

   The quality of the pad is top notch and I noticed that there isn’t any
   absorbent stitching in the edges where baby lays which makes it more
   waterproof then the leading companies pads.

   Price wise, you’re looking at $34.99. For the quality, size and comfort
   I’d say it’s fair, but realistically your baby will be changed where
   it’s convenient and I personally would not spend nearly $40 on this.

   4 out of 5 stars. The price is a little high given how often I used it.

   Kirstyn

   I received this product at no charge from the Kolcraft Mom Matters test
   group in return for an honest review.

My Pet Onesie {Review & Giveaway}

   Published on April 5, 2018April 8, 2018 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   I think it’s pretty safe to say that everyone loves kids and everyone
   loves animals (especially puppies and kittens). If for some reason, you
   don’t then I’m sure you know someone who does, so keep reading!

   Screen Shot 2018-03-05 at 1.06.53 PM

   My Pet Onesie is a US based company, with a US made products that allow
   you to upload your pet’s picture and have it printed on a onesie or
   child’s shirt. They offer a wide array of designs and both long and
   short sleeved onesies. They have 4 color choices for onesies (even more
   colors for shirts): white, pink, gray and black.  DSC_1141

   I chose the WOW So Art onesie and used a picture of my Great Dane,
   Ryder. I was a tad bit skeptical due to the naturally small size of a
   onesie, the 4 faces that are used on the particular design I chose, and
   the fact that I used a close up picture of my 160lb dog. When I
   received the product, I was pleasantly surprised at not only the
   quality of the onesie itself but the fact that the design is actually
   screen-printed on the shirt and isn’t a vinyl like I have seen with
   other companies.

   Screen Shot 2018-04-02 at 11.25.43 AM Ease of Ordering:  No, really, it
   was that simple. So honestly, it’s pretty simple. You find the
   onesie/shirt design you want, and when applicable you choose your color
   and size, then you upload your pet’s picture and they do the rest!

   Design: I LOVE that it is screen printed and not heat transfer vinyl
   (HTV)! I feel this will make it hold up longer and last throughout the
   multiple washes that kids clothes tend to go through. I also LOVE that
   the onesie has lap shoulders to allow for easy changing.

   Sizing: I ordered a 6m for Gabriel. He is 27″ and 19lbs and it fits
   perfectly! He will have room to grow but it’s not baggy. The offer NB,
   6M, 12M, 18M and 24M in onesies and they offer sizes 2, 3, 4, 5/6 in
   their toddler shirts.  DSC_1133

   Pricing: The onesies are $24.99 and the toddler shirts are $26.99 –
   $29.99. For the quality of the product, the fact the design is printed
   onto the fabric and not HTV, and that the design is custom- this is
   pretty comparable to other items I have found in the past. I paid
   nearly $40 for Cayden’s 3rd Birthday custom shirt and I think the
   quality was inferior.

   Shipping/Packaging: Shipping is $4.95 flat rate with free shipping over
   $49! Also, for being a custom item, shipping was surprisingly quick. I
   placed my order on February 14th and it was delivered to me on February
   21. The onesie arrived in a typical solid white shipping envelope with
   the My Pet Onesie logo on the top of the label. Inside, the onesie was
   in its own plastic bag with the packing slip.

   Customer Service: I reached out to their customer service department
   for no reason in particular but honestly, just wanted to judge response
   time. I received a prompt response to all forms of communication.

   [img_2266.jpg?w=760]

   Our overall rating?  five-stars

Chameleon Kidz Blendy Pen {Review} and GIVEAWAY

   Published on December 21, 2017December 29, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.com17 Comments

   **Comment on this post for a chance to win a Jumbo Blendy Pen Set! More
   details at the bottom**

   We loves crafts, coloring, painting, and overall everything handmade.
   Who doesn’t? When given the opportunity to review Chameleon Kidz Blendy
   Pens I couldn’t resist.

   Each blendy pen, although (2) markers- one on each end, are connected
   with a Fusion Chamber, which turns each individual marker into two more
   colors. temporary 2

   Included with the kit were: 20 Blendy Pens, 10 Fusion Chambers, 10
   Color Changing Posters, 2 sheets of Stencils, and 1 Blendy Pen
   Airbrush.

   I started coloring one of the posters just to see how these pens truly
   “blended” (The poster isn’t complete, but stay tuned for an update).
   First, I was hesitant because I figured twisting the pens together and
   blending them would permanently ruin the colors, but I was wrong. The
   colors, as soon as the blended color runs out, goes

   temporary back to being the original color. It really is pretty cool.

   The Blendy Pen Airbrush is pretty cool but I found it got messy
   quickly, you put a pen into the chamber, blow in the other end, and it
   blows the ink onto the paper in a well, airbrush type fashion. You can
   use the stencils, or freestyle.

   A little over a year ago, we wrote this review about these amazing
   bracelets. Well, we’re back to let our wonderful readers know that
   absolutely nothing has changed. We still love them and we still give a
   5 out of 5! [temporary-1.jpg?w=447&#038;h=670]

   If you aren’t familiar with Sashka Co, let me fill you in:

   The bracelets are handmade, bead by bead, but artisan woman in the
   Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Sashka Co is partnered with various
   organizations that train and employ hundreds of artisans in rural
   communities. Essentially, they help the artisan women rise above
   poverty through fair trade practices and over 70% of profits go back to
   Nepal. Over 70%!

   Sashka Co still offers their Perfect Fit Guarantee, Lifetime Guarantee
   and Free Shipping on orders over $25  (under $25 is $3 flat rate) and
   they have more and more beautiful colors and sets to choose from.

   When we did the review a year ago, my youngest was 3.5 so not really
   grabby, now that we have Gabe, who is 3 months old and once he gets
   ahold of something, you have to pry his fingers off of it, I haven’t
   been able to wear any jewelry… EXCEPT my Sashka Co bracelet.
   [temporary-2.jpg?w=447&#038;h=298] The fact that they are woven with
   cotton thread and not elastic, he can yank and pull all he wants, and
   there is no fear of stretching the thread and snapping it.

   The quality is amazing, the price is amazing, and the overall mission
   and story behind these bracelets is amazing.

   Have you purchased yours yet? If not, head on over to Sashka Co. but be
   warned, you won’t buy just 1!

   Leave us a comment below to let us know just how much you love yours!

Play & Go {Product Review}

   Published on November 30, 2017November 29, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   Getting our kids to clean up there toys is always a tedious,
   argumentative task. Cayden’s new thing is “I can’t carry them all”- to
   which I typically have him use his shirt as a “pouch” and I fill it up.
   It’s cute- but it’s annoying.

   I was thrilled when offered to review the Play & Go. It’s a play mat,
   storage system that when flat acts as the play mat, and when it’s done
   being utilized, a draw string cinches the sack together and cleans
   everything up.

   temporary-31.jpg

   Cayden loves cars. He loves racing them around, driving them, making
   roads and lining them all up. What he doesn’t like is cleaning them up.

   img_9494 The Play & Go mat didn’t change that, but helped it not be
   such an argument. We received the Play & Go Roadmap print and Cayden
   loved it. He immediately went and got his cars while I flattened the
   mat out in the living room.

   Now, this thing is huge! 55″ in diameter to be exact and the material
   is high quality, thick, polycotton canvas so durability isn’t even a
   concern.

   temporary 2

   The size is great as a play mat, but isn’t small hand friendly. Cayden,
   who is 4.5, couldn’t cinch it together by himself. I had no problem
   helping him, but would love to see something easier for smaller hands.

   Overall what I don’t like, is the draw string system. There are two
   places to pull the drawstring and with a 4.5 foot diameter, it leaves a
   weird taco shaped ordeal, not the “sack” I was hoping for. I think if
   it had 4 places to pull to cinch it closed, it would be better and
   close more efficiently.  temporary

   Price wise, you’re looking around $40 for the regular sized and they do
   offer a Mini which is only $20. It is the same concept, same material,
   but only 15″ in diameter. It works great in the car for travel toys, a
   quick snack holder for park trips, or every a makeup bag. Play & Go has
   a color and design for everyone. Their Classic Collection offers 8
   solid colors, the Print Collection offers 14 fun (yet subtle) prints,
   and their Designer Collection offers 5 choices including a “Color Your
   Own”. The Mini Play & Go is only available in 2 prints- either Cherrys
   or Thunderbolts.

   You can find this versatile product on Amazon, in select speciality
   stores or you can send an email to info@hotalinginc.com where they can
   take you order and ship it direct.

   Love the concept and the size. Not a fan of the seemingly ineffective
   draw string and think it would be more effective with 4 handles instead
   of 2.

   4 out of 5 stars.

No More Digging for Straps- My Baby Carseat SideKick Review

   Published on November 27, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   We’ve all been there… you place your sweet bundle of joy peacefully
   into their car seat only to realize that they’re laying on the straps
   and you now have to dig around to not only locate them, but you have to
   physically pull them out from under your baby and try your hardest not
   to upset the volatile little one … multiply the anxiety by 1,000,000 if
   your baby is asleep and your plan is to keep them that way.  temporary
   5

   My Baby Carseat SideKick is here to solve that problem. Using something
   as simple (and extremely innovate) as a magnet, you can now easily pull
   the straps out of the way and get rid of the hassle of digging around.

   The system is simple- two magnetic strap covers, two magnetic bells and
   (two sets of) two plastic clips. That’s it! It’s really that simple.

   I’m not going to lie, I was super skeptical and so was Danny. We
   seriously thought that there was absolutely no way a magnet could
   effectively hold car seat straps out of the way. I’m pretty ashamed to
   admit how wrong we were, because truthfully, I have no idea what we
   would do without our Carseat SideKick now.

   Installation was easy, like took literally 5 seconds. The hardest part
   was figuring out what shape clip would work the best with our car seat.


   temporary 6 We have a BabyTrend 1st Debut  and tried both clips (one is
   rectangular and one is more oval shaped) and found with our car seat,
   the more oval one works the best. You simply clip it on to the handle
   on the sides, velcro the strap covers below the chest clip and you’re
   done.
   [img_9289.png?w=480&#038;h=283] Price wise, you’re looking at $22.95,
   with free shipping over $50. For the quality of the product, this price
   is spot-on and well worth its weight in gold.

   I haven’t had any troubles with the magnets detaching or coming undone
   and I’ve been able to get G in his car seat and buckle him in with no
   digging around numerous times. He even stayed asleep a few times.

   Seriously, this is a must have product for everyone who has children in
   car seats, and I can tell you that I have found my go-to baby shower
   gift for all my friends and family. They offer the product in 3 colors:
   blue arrows, pink leaves, and yellow chevron. So there is a color for
   everyone and very neutral patterns. We received the blue arrows and I
   love the pattern and color.

   5 out of 5 from me, but if I could assign a 6th star I would.

Stair Barrier {Review}

   Published on November 8, 2017November 10, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   We all have been there… those plastic, slide adjustment baby
   gates…there was always that weird in-between setting where it was
   either too loose or too tight. You end up settling for something in the
   middle and if the wind blew the wrong way, it fell over. Storage was a
   pain, taking it down and putting it back up was a pain… If you wanted
   to install it on the bottom of your stairs, you were S.O.L and
   installed at the top of the stairs isn’t the safest thing! All it takes
   is a little weight and pressure and your regular baby gate comes
   dislodged and your gate and child or pet are tumbling down the stairs.

   Cumbersome baby gates, move over- Stair Barrier is the most
   aesthetically pleasing and versatile baby gate on the market.

   temporary

   The Stair Barrier is available in a variety of different fabrics ,
   sizes, and Banister-to-Wall or Banister-to-Banister type and requires
   very little to no time to install. In short, it will easily fit pretty
   much any staircase without problem.

   To touch on the different points-

   temporary

   Fabric: The variety of fabric choices allows for you to have a gate
   that compliments pretty much every theme and design style you can
   imagine. There is also an option to personalize them so if your house
   is anything like mine, and your stairs smack you in the face when you
   walk in the front door, having a bit of personalization is a nice
   touch. Now, the personalization does take about 2 weeks longer, but you
   have the option of ordering your Barrier and having the personalized
   patch mailed separate (it Velcro’s on- pretty nifty). They also make an
   indoor/outdoor version, which would be perfect for keep pets on or off
   decks and patios!

   Sizes: The Stair Barrier comes in 2 different sizes, regular and wide.
   It’s super simple to figure out which one you need with a simple
   measurement. There is actually an option to order a custom size as
   well.

   Screen Shot 2017-11-06 at 1.21.33 PM

   Banister-to-Wall: This is what I needed as our stairs have well, a
   banister and a wall.

   The install was fairly simple and required a few screws and that was
   it. Took maybe 10 minutes total to get it installed?

   Banister-to-Banister: This one is portable and weighs only 6lbs! It
   rolls up small enough that you can virtually take it anywhere and
   everywhere!

   temporary We received a Banister-to-Wall, wide, black and tan Chevron
   print Stair Barrier with a personalized patch. Our stairs are smack dab
   right when you walk in the front door, so I figured something even more
   aesthetically pleasing then the already amazing solid colors would
   suffice. The package came quickly in a plain brown box (the patch was
   mailed seperate). Installation was simple and overall its amazing.

   Khaki-Wall-to-Banister-Open_776x

   Although our youngest is only 8 weeks and can’t climb the stairs yet,
   its extremely helpful for keeping our dogs off the stairs. Being able
   to roll the barrier out of the way when we need to walk up and down the
   stairs is extremely helpful.

   Price wise, you’re looking at anywhere between roughly $120 and $180
   (and up to $269 for a custom size) depending on the style and if you
   chose to have your item personalized. Is this high? yes. Is it worth
   it? yes.

   Shipping is FREE and they offer a 30 day satisfaction guarantee (which
   you won’t need because this product is honestly, amazing)

   5 out of 5 from me.

HearMuffs, Protection for Your Little Ones Ears

   Published on October 22, 2017October 21, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   Us as parents do everything we can to ensure our kids are well
   protected at all costs. We spend hundreds of dollars on creams,
   lotions, sunscreens, and ways to protect our sweet kids from germs.
   But, what about their precious ears?

   21557860_518036825209447_7595078522409473663_n

   Lucid Audio has brought innovation to the market with their new to the
   market HearMuffs. This headphone style ear protection allows for the
   protection from exposure to loud noises starting at the audiologist
   recommended age of “newborn”.

   HearMuffs come in 3 different styles, each equipped with the GrowBand,
   which is a adjustable, washable, soft and comfortable band that allows
   for the perfect fit. This band is adjustable from newborn until around
   4 years of age allowing the HearMuffs to grow with your child for long
   lasting hearing protection.

   The base model, HearMuffs protect young ones ears from loud noises and
   distractions. HearMuffs Soothe and Sounds offer the same protection
   with added features. Soothe offers the protection of the base model,
   but allows for parents to speak to their child without having to pull
   off the ear muff with the press of a button while Sounds offers the
   benefits of both the base model and Soothe, but also plays 4 comforting
   sounds for added help with distractions and soothing and calming
   children of all ages.

   Screen Shot 2017-10-14 at 2.14.22 PM.png

   I do have to admit that this product is pretty great. With a newborn,
   although he sleeps through just about everything, it gives me the peace
   of mind that the vacuum cleaner, or hustle and bustle of the grocery
   store won’t hurt his tiny, developing ears. G didn’t seem to mind them
   on his head, however, seemed uncomfortable trying to lay down or sleep
   with them on as they didn’t really allow for him to lay his head to the
   side.

   The option to play the sounds is awesome and the controls are fairly
   simple to operate. The ear padding is seemingly comfortable and the
   GrowBand is easy to adjust. For the amount of time they are reasonably
   used, I think the price point for the Sounds is fairly high.

   Overall, I’d give a 4 out of 5 stars. If you have a lifestyle of hustle
   and bustle where your precious one will be around loud noises
   continually or constantly, then this is definitely the product for you.
   If you are a stay at home mom, who makes 1 weekly trip to the grocery
   store, then the $70 for the top of the line HearMuffs, may be a little
   drastic, but the base model would be perfect.

   You can get $10 off your order using code HEARMUFFS10 until the end of
   October!

Wondrous INK {Product Review, Exclusive Promo Code and Giveaway}

   Published on September 3, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   We love books. We asked for books instead of cards at Cayden’s baby
   shower, we attended library story time weekly and always ended up
   checking out between 7-10 books a week and he still practically begs
   for someone to read him a story before nap time and bed time. To say he
   has his own personal library would be an understatement.

   When I ran across Wonderous INK, I was ecstatic. Wondrous INK makes
   books, personalized for each child,  using not only their name, but a
   little character that can be chosen
   20953857_1940852529525484_560971196040242750_n to look similar to the
   child. They essentially place your child into the story and utilize the
   letter’s of his/her name in super cool ways to tell them what is
   special and unique about them!

   You start by entering the child’s name, choosing the gender and the
   character and then you can preview the book.

   I was pleasantly surprised when I received the book in the mail. It is
   in a bright red sturdy box and well protected. The book itself is made
   of super sturdy, high quality, thick paper and the colors are
   phenomenal. The package itself can be addressed directly to your child,
   so the excitement starts right at the mailbox. What kid doesn’t LOVE
   getting mail?

   20914765_1940852482858822_6280209101243200337_n
   20881818_1940852499525487_4993901909275733811_n

   20915572_1940852526192151_86335705919326294_n

   To jump to the point, Cayden LOVES his book! The wording is super cool
   and the entire story line is well written. He actually learned how to
   spell his name just with a few readings.

   Inside the book, the author uses the letters of your child’s name to
   help other characters and then describes your child with a word
   starting with that letter. In our book, the letter “C” was used as a
   horseshoe to fix the cart horse’s hoof. The letter “C” also stands for
   the word “Clever”.

   Screen Shot 2017-08-19 at 9.21.26 PM

   Screen Shot 2017-08-19 at 9.21.35 PM

   The book goes on through all of the letters of the child’s name and at
   the end, is a “paper” that states all of the unique qualities.

   Screen Shot 2017-08-19 at 9.09.29 PM

   Given the quality, cleverness, and overall design, Wonderous INK
   definitely gets a 5 out of 5!

   Wondrous INK knows that you too, will love the book so they have
   offered an exclusive promo code for our BurritoBuzz followers! To
   receive 20% off your order until the end of September, use promo code:

What Da Fluff? Monthly Cloth Diaper Subscription Box {Product Review}

   Published on August 10, 2017August 8, 2017 by KirstynVelez-
   www.BurritoBuzz.comLeave a comment

   There seems to be a subscription box for darn near everything nowadays.
   I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across a monthly subscription box
   for DIAPERS! Not just any diapers though- cloth diapers. What Da Fluff
   is a family owned and operated company (which I love) who does a
   monthly subscription box (which I love) which includes cloth diapers
   and related products (which I love). For just $15/ month or $165/year,
   you will receive a package with:

   Screen Shot 2017-08-08 at 4.22.02 PM Now, this says “one male themed
   diaper” and thats only because I chose the “Boy Box”. However, you can
   chose from boy, girl, or gender neutral.

   What makes receiving the “box” even more exciting, is the packaging. It
   is so much prettier than a plain cardboard box with a label slapped on
   it.
   20771776_1935776373366433_1421971451_o

   So, what was inside?
   20747464_1935776376699766_2100956316_o.jpg
   1- Kijani Swim Diaper
   1- Reusable Cold Pack
   3- TEViVE Tea Bags
   -and-
   2- Sweet treats!




   What else I love about this whole thing? Everything is affordable -AND-
   if you fall in love with whats in your package, if available, you can
   buy the extra inventory off the website’s shop at the end of the month!

   My star rating for What Da Fluff? is definitely at a 5 out of 5! The
   subscription itself is super affordable, the diaper product is of good
   quality and affordable, the packaging is decorative and not just plain
   jane AND its a family owned and operated company!

   Don’t worry about the need to #buyallthediapers, subscribe for some
   #fluffmail and you’ll be equally as happy!

Lucky Baby 3-in-1 Baby/Toddler Safety Harness Review

   Published on August 9, 2017August 8, 2017 by DaniLeave a comment

   Screenshot_20170705-095411

   It’s so amazing when your new little baby is finally old enough to sit
   up on their own! That means you can start bringing them into stores and
   restaurants without that huge, heavy infant car seat. Such a burden
   lifted away! Like many new moms, with my first son we had a cart cover
   that we would put over the portion of the cart the baby sits in. But
   there were a few times the straps on the cart were broken or just not
   there! Now what? We, of course, never noticed this until all our stuff
   (diaper bag, purse, coupon binder, re-usable shopping bags…yeah I take
   a lot with me to the store :/) were all in the cart and ready to go. So
   we had to take out the baby, take everything out of the cart and go
   find one that had the straps intact. What a nightmare! Especially when
   my husband stopped being able to accompany us to the store, so that
   meant that I had to do all this hunting and putting together by myself
   with a baby in my arms.

   Well, needless to say like every mom out there, I learned some lessons
   and tried some new things once baby boy #2 came along! The thought
   struck me one day at the zoo while my youngest (16 months old at the
   time) was throwing his biggest fit of the day over sitting on my lap
   for lunch versus sitting in a provided highchair right next to me. The
   rest of us (me, my husband and our oldest son) were all sitting in
   chairs around the table and my husband had removed a chair in order to
   place the highchair next to me. Big mistake! Turns out our youngest
   just wanted to sit in the chair (or my lap) with the rest of us but
   like many young toddlers, he wasn’t still in the least bit! That drive
   home I looked up portable high chairs so the lunch situation would not
   happen again! Amazon.com is a great place to get baby items and was the
   first place I looked when I came across the Lucky Baby 3 -in- 1
   Baby/Toddler Safety Harness! Available in 2 colors, Swifty Black and
   Patriot (which we got) for only $26.99 on Amazon Prime, it was a deal
   we could not pass up, specially concerning that I’m going to Disneyland
   after Thanksgiving with my family this year and it is always a good
   idea to pack prepared for anything (like no highchairs presented). What
   really caught my eye was the fact that it serves 3 purposes and I have
   not meant a mom yet that does not enjoy a baby/kid items that can be
   used for multiple things!

   20170805_115324

   Walking Harness:

   This part had me confused when I read the instructions but it’s so
   easy! Hold up the leg holes into the waistband, place around your
   child’s chest and loosen the straps (if they’re still tight from using
   it as a high chair or cart strap). There is a nifty loop in the middle
   where both ends of the straps come together.


   20170805_132258

   Portable Highchair and Cart Safety Strap:

   So you have your baby place their legs in the leg holes and tighten the
   Velcro waistband (not too tight because the baby will get hurt, but
   also tight enough the waistband will not fall off). Then simply sit the
   baby on the chair/cart and unbuckle the two straps and re-buckle them
   around the chair’s/cart’s back. The only issue I have had is the buckle
   is hard to squeeze because it has that middle button you are suppose to
   press as well as the 2 side buttons. But once the straps are around the
   chair/cart, you simply pull them until they are tight enough around the
   chair/cart!

   I LOVE this product! It was well made, washable (every baby item should
   be!) and folds up nicely to fit in my purse/diaper bag/ car kit/
   whatever. We never go anywhere without it! It has become a staple in
   our diaper bag, one of those products I wish I had found sooner and a
   product I plan on gifting to my friends in the next coming months! It
   works as a walking harness for bot my 5 year old (when we are in
   crowded areas and we don’t want to lose him) and my youngest loves it,
   he stops and puts his arms up whenever we bring it out with us. We
   bring it even when we bring the stroller because baby boy is wanting
   more and more to run with his brother and dad, so this harness is
   perfect for our family! You can find the product here.

Hope For Chance {Guest Blogger}

   Published on July 17, 2017July 16, 2017 by KirstynVelez-

   Pink and Blue. You see these colors most often associated with the
   birth of a new baby. Adorable, pink, frills and bows for a sweet girl,
   blue hats and onesies for a bouncing baby boy. These colors also adorn
   the awareness ribbon for Pregnancy and Infant Loss.

   My name is Michelle Moskiewicz and I was brought into the world of
   infant loss on August 7, 2013. Chance, my sweet boy Chance was a
   wonderful, beautiful, healthy 20158299_10100673121551136_515744570_n
   baby boy who was taken by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome at two months
   and twenty-six days old. I guess it’s best to start from the beginning
   and work my way into that night and how we went about forming Hope For
   Chance, our non profit organization, that helps with families who have
   suffered from pregnancy and infant loss.

   I found out I was pregnant with Chance about one month into my first
   deployment. According to the Air Force docs, I was just a little over
   two months pregnant. So, the Marine Corps sent me home.


   Our pregnancy had a few complications, but Chance made his debut at
   thirty-seven weeks on the dot. He was a handsome chubby-cheeked boy who
   liked watching his dog and listening to “Wagon Wheel” by Old Crow
   Medicine Band (he wasn’t very fond of the Darius Rucker version). He
   was the piece of our family puzzle that my husband and I didn’t realize
   we were missing. With him, everything was as it should be. His blue
   eyes, blonde hair, and widow’s peak made him the spitting image of his
   father- which after being in active labor for sixteen hours I didn’t
   find fair, but he was perfect.
   20158261_10100673121536166_1519551753_n
   20179953_10100673121546146_160100192_n

   It was that night, no, early morning when our lives changed forever. My
   husband had woken up to go to the restroom and had stopped by Chance’s
   crib to check on him. I only remember his screaming for me to wake up
   and call 911. For the next five or twenty minutes (it felt like
   forever) I gave my little boy CPR while simultaneously praying to God
   that this was a nightmare. To this day, I can still remember the chill
   on his skin against mine. We followed the paramedics to the hospital
   and were told there was nothing that they could do, my baby was gone.
   We were able to hold him for awhile. We were able to kiss his tiny
   head, to smell his scent, to hold him in our arms. My heart and muscles
   still ache for that weight, for that smell, to look down and see him.

   20134829_10100673121541156_1834185938_n

   Almost immediately we were pushed into the Loss World. We were still
   driving home when we got a call from the hospital asking permission to
   use Chance’s heart valves. We went through an interview with the
   police, after they’d gone through our home, Chance’s things. They took
   samples of his formula, of our water, dirty diapers, his crib sheet.
   They were looking for a reason, a cause. I am so happy they did now
   that I look back. For an infant to be classified as SIDS there has to
   be no other cause of death plausible. Chance had been in his crib, on
   his back, with nothing else. They had no idea what killed my baby boy.
   20179905_10100673123542146_1794190815_n

   Immediately I began researching SIDS and getting into contact with all
   of the major researchers in the United States and joining all of the
   support groups Facebook had to offer. It was there that I read the
   story of a family who, after buying all the things a baby needed, still
   owing the hospital for birthing because insurance didn’t cover it all,
   after only having her baby girl home for three days, lost her to SIDS.
   She couldn’t afford a service, a burial, or an urn. She got her
   daughter’s ashes back in a plastic bag. I said no. I told myself I
   would never allow that to happen to another family if I could help it.
   20134865_10100673122569096_1879182236_n That is the moment that Hope
   For Chance was born in my mind. Within four months, Hope For Chance was
   a 501(c)3 non profit whose goal was to assist families who had lost a
   baby (does not have to be SIDS) with the costs of services, burials,
   and cremation. We also donate funds to research for Dr. Hannah Kinney
   at the Boston Children’s Hospital, and every year we host the Run For
   Hope, an annual 5k awareness run to bring more awareness and education
   to what SIDS is, what it isn’t, and how families can keep their babies
   safe during sleep. Hope For Chance, in our short four years has been
   able to help several families across the United States give their
   babies a sweet goodbye.

   20138064_10100673123532166_997117925_o

   While every late night phone call and e-mail from a family in need or a
   funeral home does remind me of our own loss, it also reminds me that
   though he is not here in our arms, he is alive in our hearts and in the
   hearts of everyone that knows our
   story and those we have helped. We will be remembering Chance’s fourth
   Angelversary this year in just under a month.

   I would like to thank Kirstyn for allowing me to guest post here on
   BurritoBuzz. She and I were brought together by happenstance, through
   our losses. I hope that any mothers or fathers out there who have
   suffered the loss of a child, whether miscarriage, stillbirth, infant
   loss through adult loss, know that you are not alone. One in four women
   suffer with you. We are the guardians of our children’s memories.
   Whether that memory be a positive test, an ultrasound, a first smile,
   the first day of kindergarten, or graduation. You are not alone.

   -Michelle

My First Cubby from Little Partners {Review}

   Published on February 20, 2017February 19, 2017 by Casey SehmLeave a
   comment

   d34b7eacde8e85faf23a8b18f840ae53 If you’re a new or expecting parent,
   I’m going to let you in on a little secret. SPOIL ALERT! That tiny
   squishy baby will soon be an independent almost 5 year old faster than
   you can ever imagine. Time flies (I’m not at all exaggerating) and soon
   your little angel will be a wanting to do everything for him or herself
   with zero help from mom and dad. In my case, that new found
   independence is so welcomed. I gave birth to my youngest daughter 11
   months ago (how is she almost one? *insert crying emoji) so my oldest
   wanting to do things for herself is a huge help. Whether it’s getting
   herself dressed, brushing her teeth by herself, going to the bathroom
   alone, or simply getting herself a lp_cubby_lifestyle-800x800 snack,
   it’s one less thing that I have to do. So I jumped at the opportunity
   to review My First Cubby ($159.99) from Little Partners!

   We have worked with Little Partners in the past and we love their
   products! You can check out the Tri-Side Learn & Play Art Center review
   here. I was excited to see how the Little Cubby could make our lives
   easier and help my daughter grow even more independently. First of all,
   the construction is solid. It was rather easy t cub o put together, the
   instructions are very easy to read, and it was put together rather
   quickly (my husband builds furniture for a living so he may have had an
   advantage). Once built, I noticed the amazing quality. It’s sturdy and
   looks very classy in our hallway, it’s a piece of furniture you can be
   happy to put on display. After a quick screw in the wall for the tether
   to prevent it from falling, it was ready to go!

   There are 2 sides, which is perfect for us so each kid can have their
   own side. There’s a top cubby that we use for hats. Below that is a
   section with 4 hooks on each side to hang coats and bags. On the bottom
   is a little cubby for a 2-3 pairs of shoes. My girls have so many shoes
   but I put the ones out that they were most often. I seriously love
   being able to ask my daughter to her jacket, shoes, and school bag and
   she knows to hang her stuff up when she gets home. It’s so nice! I love
   that it’s also teaching her to be responsible for her own things and
   she also knows where she can find her school bag or coat, it’s always
   in the same spot that she put it. The great thing is multiple cubbies
   can be pushed together for more children and for day cares or schools!

   I’m beyond impressed with Little Partners. The My First Cubby will
   complete any bedroom, foyer, or playroom! I give My First Cubby a 5 out
   of 5 stars, it’s been such a help in our house and while the cubby is
   available in two beautiful wood finishes, I would love to see options
   available in colors. Soon enough my youngest will be able to hang her
   coat and bag on her side, but for now, my oldest is happy to lend me a
   helping hand!

A Day In The Life Of Twins.{Guest Blogger}

   Published on February 15, 2017February 15, 2017 by AmandaLeave a
   comment

   16736705_10104229509146770_729079791_n When someone asks you to tell
   you what a day in the life having twins is like, the first word that
   comes to mind is deja vu! So, imagine everyday is groundhog day, except
   what you just did starts over 5 minutes later. Is there such thing as
   groundhog minute? As much as my twins are alike, they are completly
   different. First and foremost, my twins are fraternal twins. One boy.
   One girl.  L&N.  The love between them is something to witness. They
   love each other but are jealous of each other as well!

   1.png

   We have a rough schedule for these two.
     * They wake up (later than most children because of the schedule we
       put them on 🙂 ), eat breakfast, play for about two hours
     * take a 2 hour nap
     * get up
     * eat lunch
     * play for another hour or two
     * shorter nap, get up
     * play until dinner
     * then play until “bottle,”
     * then finally bed.

   Sounds about a normal toddler kind of day right? I’ll get into a little
   more detail for you now…

   2

   N wakes up at 5:45am, wants to cuddle, bring to bed until he is back to
   sleep then take him back to crib.

   N wakes up at 9:30-9:45am, time for breakfast.

   When we go in to get N, L is up as well and is giggling to get up and
   eat too. Pick up N, put him in his seat, go back pick up L, put her in
   her seat, make breakfast times two, cut up to their size and put on
   their trays.

   Start to make my breakfast after theirs is on their plate. Get mine in
   the toaster or blender, turn around to N telling me “more” (baby sign
   language is AMAZING). L is only a couple bite behind him.

   Pause my breakfast to make some more for them, cut it up, put on their
   trays.

   Finally finish making my breakfast to see the “more” sign. Ok, milk
   time. Make two sippys of milk, sit down to eat and drink my coffee.
   3.png

   After I finish my breakfast/coffee, I get them cleaned up and out of
   their seats to go change their diapers.

   Now it is play time. They usually let me know they are tired when they
   are playing when start laying with the blankets and rubbing their eyes.
   With one question, “Are you ready for your nap?,” we march our way back
   to their cribs, where they stand in front of theirs designated cribs
   waiting for binkie and “up.”

   Naptime is GLORIOUS! Two to three hours of work time. Whether it’s my
   small business work or getting some things done around the house. Hubs
   would say I do nothing. Don’t listen to that man! Haha! During this
   time, I get to eat a warm lunch. Some general peace and quiet. Maybe
   even shower and put normal clothes on.

   Around 3:00-3:30pm, N&L wake up. This wake up is the easiest as they
   are usually giggling and talking to each other in their room.  4.png

   So, N&L are up and it is time for lunch.  Here is where they can be
   different.  Two out of three meal times can end up with multiple meals
   being made. L has a texture thing. She might like the food, but if she
   doesn’t like the texture she won’t eat it unless you give her a fork
   and put the food on the fork for her.  N is a garbage disposal.  He
   eats almost anything and everything.  But N also has a little reflux so
   right now spaghetti is out of the question until we determine if he is
   just overeating it or if it irritates him.

   Mealtime is usually over when they start throwing the food on the
   floor. They are like cats about it! You tell them no and they will
   stare you in the eyes and just hold their hand over the edge of their
   tray then drop it on the floor.  N gets cleaned up, then L, change N’s
   diaper and then L’s. N will probably buck around this time with poop on
   his butt or L will have a dirty diaper and try to grab what’s on her
   bum before i get the wipe to it. Do they make squeegees for baby bums?
   If not someone get on that!

   L loves books, music, princess, and dollies.  N likes music, balls or
   anything he can throw, and anything he can try to take away from his
   sister. This play time usually ends up in a “fight.” N likes to throw
   his arms around, usually smacking L in the head. But don’t fear L may
   be small, but she is mighty and will knock N on his tush.

   Most days, these two will get grumpy about 5pm and it’ll be time for
   nap number two.  If not, while Mama is making dinner, they will be
   right behind me pulling out everything in any lower cabinet. The
   favorite thing to play with this week is the bag of unopened pepperoni.
   But don’t worry, when you try to get it, N will more than like run away
   with it then throw it over his head at you and L will be a doll and
   HOPEFULLY pick it up for you for you get there and put it away.

   Dinner is served. Same deal except this time L is loving the green
   beans you put on her tray and N is throwing them on the floor with
   force!  Clean up after meals is twice the fun because you have two
   trays to clean up, an entire dining room to sweep, two faces and four
   hands to wipe down plus if they had plates.

   N and L are usually a little grumpy after dinner but Mama and Daddy
   might just think that because we had been going all day with no nap
   like they got! They will play, watch some toons, dance, Change N’s
   diaper whose is again kicking his legs, knocking things off the
   changing table. Then L’s diaper who is actually being a peach reading a
   book this time. Their other favorite sign during this time of night is
   “cookie.”  I usually end up with “more cookie” instead of just
   “cookie.” I blame that on Daddy, his nickname is Cookie Monster.

   Come about 9:45-10:00pm, they are getting super grouchy.  “Babies, you
   want your baba?” Both squeal, march off to the kitchen where we make
   their bottles, and don’t leave our side until we are ready to go back
   to the living room where they climb into their spots for their last
   small “meal” of the day.

   When they are done, both will get up when you ask if they are ready for
   bed, waddle their way back to their room.  Change L’s diaper. Change
   N’s diaper. Turn the music on because N won’t sleep without it. If we
   forget, 30 minutes later, N is screaming for it.

   5

   Finally, they are in their cribs and time for relaxation. NOPE! Two
   times the toys to pick up, still need to finish putting dirty dishes in
   the dishwasher, and oops I forgot to include someone in all of this…
   BIG GIRL!!

   I didn’t forget her! Typing our day out without including her actually
   proved to be quite difficult! Ha! BG is very similar to N but she is 4
   years old and usually starts all off all of these events, not N. BG
   loves her brother and sister very much but also loves her alone time,
   too! She shares a lot and is learning what she is and isn’t allowed to
   share.  Which is great for us because instead of trying to keep those
   little food themed toys away from one toddler mouth, we have two
   mouths. Our fingers have plenty of bite marks to prove. Those 1 year
   old molars really do hurt!
   I love my twins! We were only going to have one more kid after BG. I
   always joked with my husband that we were going to be the ones in his
   family who end up having twins because they run in his family. Even two
   days before the ultrasound that told us we were having twins, I asked
   “what are you going to do if there is two in there?” He didn’t find it
   as funny as I did, even two days later.  Life wouldn’t be the same
   without those two.  I catch even try to imagine what it would be like
   without one or the other because they are both so amazing! They truly
   do make our little family complete.

Baby Dam {Product Review}

   babydam12

   Who else despises baby bath tubs? I know I couldn’t stand them when my
    toddlers were tiny. They take up so much room, I never felt like they
   were safe enough, and they were such a waste of money since you only
   use them for a few months. Thankfully my kids were close together and
   BK#2 starting sitting fairly early so the need for a baby tub/seat was
   virtually not needed. Now we just [DEL: use :DEL] way too many gallons
   of water and fill up the tub for both of them. Scratch that!  We USED
   to use too much water. That is until Baby Dam sent us their awesome
   product.

   The Baby Dam The BabyDam bathtub divider is a unique patented product
   that allows you to customize the size of your bathtub to fit your need
   and to conserve the amount of water that you fill up your tub with.

   Below: Without the BabyDam^® barrier
   (Using 100% of tub & 30 gallons of water)


   Below: With the BabyDam^® barrier
   (Using 50% of tub & 15 gallons of water)

     thebigpicture.png

   It is made with the highest quality materials that exceed the European
   and United States safety standards!  There are two different styles you
   can choose from depending on the way that your tub is made.

   If the inside width of your bath tub is between 22.5 inches & 26.5
   inches, order the BabyDam^® in US & Canada size.

   If the inside width of your bath tub is LESS THAN 22.5 inches wide,
   order the BabyDam^^® in European size.

   The tub divider makes a secure and tight seal on a CLEAN and dry tub. I
   found that if there was any soap residue left from a previous shower or
   bath that I hard a very hard time getting the divider to suction
   properly. I never had an instance that it wouldn’t stick, but it would
   let a little water through to the other side. It was easily remedied by
   following the given directions specifically!
   babydam2.jpg Notice the little bit of water on the other side of the
   dam



   It takes only a minute to install on your tub, and you can use suction
   cups to hang it on the back of your shower wall to save room. No
   storing a big bulky baby tub anymore!

   Buy yours here!  And be sure to follow them on Facebook and Instagram!

   I am beyond excited about this new product!  It is a money saver, a
   time saver, and more importantly safe!  It give me such an amazing
   peace of mind that my littles ones have much less room to slide around
   in. I cant wait for more of my friends have babies, because I know what
   I will be gifting them!

VertiPlay™ Wall Toys from Oribel {Toy Review}

   Published on February 1, 2017February 2, 2017 by Casey SehmLeave a
   comment

   It’s been over a month since Christmas and I don’t know about you, but
   I’m still feeling the overwhelming wrath of my kids’ new toys. Each
   year, I clean out and donate toys that they no longer play with to make
   room for the new stuff, but it’s still not enough. Their play room in
   the basement is littered with toys. I’ve stepped on so many little
   fullsizerender toys, at times I was positive I broke my foot. So when I
   was asked to review toy from Oribel, I was obviously hesitant. But but
   VertiPlay™ is unlike any game or toy children own, and the best part?
   They don’t add extra clutter on the floor and won’t be stepping on
   little pieces!

   VertiPlay™ Wall Toys from Oribel are fun, whimsical toys that hang on
   the wall or door, allowing for free space on the floor but offering
   tons of fun! It’s a win-win for both mom and children! No more asking
   over and over for your kids to pick up their toys! Another plus? You
   won’t mind them on your wall! They’re visually appealing and simply add
   to your child’s bedroom or playroom decor. VertiPlay™ also gets
   your little ones up and gets their blood flowing as they stand at the
   wall to play and run around.
   img_6480
   img_6477

   The designs are simple, engaging, and fun my little one loves her Busy
   Woodpecker ($19.90)! It was really easy to attach to the wall, I just
   wiped the spot clean, removed the back of the sticker, and attached it
   to the wall. Easy peasy. My little one loves tapping the the
   woodpecker’s tail (sometimes a little too much) to light up the the
   little bird’s house in the tree. The wooden windmills help with
   dexterity through fun play! There are many different designs and styles
   for a range of ages, from 9+ months to 3+ years, verti1 you can see
   them all here! The quality is superb, I would expect nothing less from
   Oribel! I adore their products. And while I haven’t removed our wall
   toy, it leaves no damage to the wall and is easy to peal off.

   VertiPlay™ gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me. The price point of each set
   is just right and my daughter really loves playing with her woodpecker
   toy. If you’re ready to shop for your own VertiPlay™ Wall Toy, you can
   head to your local Babies R Us or shop online at Amazon and
   diapers.com. I will definitely be adding a few more wall toys to our
   playroom, as my oldest is a little jealous she didn’t get one! If you
   have an older child, I think the Goofy Moose is perfect for them! Be
   sure to follow Oribel on Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram for new
   products and more, you won’t be disappointed with this fabulous
   company!

Flying Squirrel. A New Kind Of Sleep Sack by Sleeping Baby. *GIVEAWAY!*

   Published on January 30, 2017January 29, 2017 by AmandaLeave a comment

   sleepingbabyburritobuzz …notice blanket all the way at the end of his
   bed!

   Every night I sneak into our baby’s room to re-tuck him back in and
   ensure his room is warm enough. Some nights I used to even turn the
   heat up in the house just to make sure he was warm. The winter months
   are brutal here in Ohio and our little one makes it worse by NEVER
   staying covered up. I always thought sleep sacks, and ‘toddler sleeping
   bags’ were unnecessary and ridiculous looking. A cozy fuzzy blanket is
   MUCH cuter. We are well past the stage of not being allowed to have
   extra bedding in his bed, so swaddles and sacks shouldn’t be needed,
   right? WRONG. BK#2 HATES being covered. He appeases us, snuggles up
   with his lovey, lets us cover him with an adorable Aden & Anias dream
   blanket, and then the second that we walk out of his room he pushes it
   to the opposite end of his crib. Really kid?!?!

   Thus, began the search for the perfect toddler sleeping solution. I
   really wanted a way to help my baby sleep without waking, because he
   was cold, but he is much too old for traditional swaddles. I found some
   awesome sleep sacks, but the fact that they are a sack makes him pretty
   mad. He was getting used to it, but I kept on searching to find
   something to keep him warm AND happy.

   I FOUND THE BEST SOLUTION FOR ALL AGES! our-brands-zipadeezip.jpg

   Sleeping Baby has the perfect products for infants transitioning out of
   swaddles, for toddlers like mine refusing to stay covered and warm at
   night, for preschoolers needing a sleep solution for nap time at
   school, even teethers,  and necklaces for mom!

   Sleeping Baby is AMAZING COMPANY with an even better story. They truly
   have a heart for their customers and LOVE what they do! They started
   their company making something to transition their daughter out of the
   traditional swaddle and created the revolutionary Zipadee-Zip, that was
   discovered and aired on Shark Tank! I could go on and on about this
   couple, because they are truly an inspiration to all parents to follow
   your dreams and to do what is best for you and your family, but I
   really want to talk about the FLYING SQUIRREL so I encourage you to
   read all about it here! Sleeping-Baby-522x348.jpg

   WHAT IS A FLYING SQUIRREL? FS_Woodlands_Blue_Front_large.png
     * They are an extension of the Zippy because they’re the same basic
       shape, but have option openings/covers for the hands and feet.
     * The convertible hand and foot covers (like a new born onsie’s
       optional mitten flip overs )are to  to keep your little one extra
       cozy and warm without the need for socks. Seriously, ADORABLE! BK#2
       hated the mitten option on his hands, but it gave me all the feels
       remembering  the itty bitty baby onsies. I am going to keep trying
       and maybe he will indulge me and let me cover his hands!
     * It comes in sizes 2T-5T.
     * Fleece or SUPER soft cotton option. We received the cotton
       material. – I suggest the cotton for spring and the fleece for
       winter months. (I put a set of PJ’s under the cotton material,
       because it wasn’t as heavy for winter as I normally would use.)
     * At LEAST a dozen prints for each gender, and many are gender
       neutral! sleepingbabyburritobuzzzipper
       sleepingbabyburritobuzzzipper2
     * Zipper coverings! The top of the zipper is always enclosed and
       there is a layer of fabric covering the zipper on the inside to
       ensure you don’t snag your baby or their clothes.
     * They run big and look at little baggy on your child. That is how
       they are supposed to be! Don’t worry! You want your baby to be able
       to move around freely in their bed AND if gives the product more
       longevity! All parents know that baby gear lasts for no time at
       all.
     * They wash up wonderfully! They stay super soft and buttery, and the
       print doesn’t fade one bit!
     * Fairly priced at $36.95 . This might sound a little high for
       “pj’s”, but for sleepers and sleep sacks its just right and around
       the same price as SIMILAR products on the market. THERE IS NOTHING
       ELSE LIKE THIS DESIGN AVAILABLE!
