Open source software for creating private and public clouds.

   OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and
   networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a
   dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular
   enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for
   heterogeneous infrastructure.

   Hundreds of the world’s largest brands rely on OpenStack to run their
   businesses every day, reducing costs and helping them move faster.
   OpenStack has a strong ecosystem, and users seeking commercial support
   can choose from different OpenStack-powered products and services in
   the Marketplace.

OpenStack turns 8: Welcoming new users, more collaboration and new projects

   Sunny

   July 20, 2018

   We are celebrating the 8th birthday of OpenStack with the entire
   OpenStack community during July! OpenStack is an integration engine for
   diverse technologies, fostering collaboration among emerging
   communities, and the Foundation facilitates the development of many
   innovative projects in the open infrastructure space. None of it would
   be possible without the quickly growing, global community. There are
   now more than 90,000 community members across 183 countries and more
   than 670 supporting companies. We think that deserves a worldwide
   celebration!


   We’ve invited all our user groups to celebrate with us. This month,
   more than 30 OpenStack birthday parties will be thrown all over the
   world – celebrating the OpenStack community!  We encourage everyone to
   find a birthday party in your area and join your fellow community
   members to toast each other on another great year! Don’t forget to post
   and share your pictures and memories on Flickr.


   Find a local celebration in your area:

Release Cycles vs. Downstream consumers PTG Summary

   Notes can be found on the original etherpad [0]. A TC resolution is in
   review [1]
   TLDR summary:
     * No consensus on longer / shorter release cycles

     * Focus on FFU to make upgrades less painful

     * Longer stable branch maintenance time (18 months for Ocata)

     * Bootstrap the “extended maintenance” concept with common policy

     * Group most impacted by release cadence are
       packagers/distros/vendors

     * Need for finer user survey questions on upgrade models

     * Need more data and more discussion, next discussion at Vancouver
       forum

     * Release Management team tracks it between events

Pros and Cons of face-to-face Meetings

   Some contributors might not be able to attend the PTG for various
   reasons:
     * Health issues

     * Privilege issues (like not getting visa or travel permits)

     * Caretaking responsibilities (children, other family, animals,
       plants)

     * Environmental concerns

   There is a concern if this is preventing us from meeting our four opens
   [1] if people are not able to attend the events.
   The PTG sessions are not recorded, but there is a super user article on
   how teams can do this themselves [0]. At the PTG in Denver, the
   OpenStack Foundation provided bluetooth speakers for teams to help with
   remote participation.
   Consensus is this may not be trivial for everyone and it could still be
   a challenge for remote participants due to things like audio quality.
   Some people at the PTG in Dublin due to the weather had to participate
   remotely from their hotel room and felt it challenging to partipate.

Final Queens RC Deadline

   Thursday 22nd of April is the deadline for any final Queens release
   candidates. We’ll enter a quiet period for a week in preparation of
   tagging the final Queens release during the PTG week. Make sure if  you
   have patches merged to stable/queens that you propose a new RC before
   the deadline. PTLs should watch for a patch from the release management
   team tagging the final release. While not required, an acknowledgement
   on the patch would be appreciated.

   DbFixture and DbTestCase. In a patch [0], and assumption was made to
   that these should be imported from oslo_db.tests.sqlalchemy. Cinder,
   Ironic and Glance have been found with this issue [1].
   Unfortunately these were not prefixed with underscores to comply with
   naming conventions for people to recognize private code. The tests
   module was included for consumers to run those tests on their own
   packages easily.

Some New Zuul Features

   Default timeout is 30 minutes for “post-run” phase of the job. A new
   attribute “timeout” [0] can set this to something else, which could be
   useful for a job that performs a long artifact upload.
   Two new job attributes added “host-vars” and “group-vars” [1] which
   behave like “vars” but applies to a specific host or group.

PTG Bot HOWTO for Dublin

   The third PTG is an event where topics of discussion are loosely
   scheduled in tracks to maximize the attendee productivity. To keep
   track of what’s happening currently we have an event schedule page [0].
   Below are some helpful discussions in using PTG bot:

Track Leads

   Track leads will be able issue various commands [1] in irc channel
   #openstack-ptg:
     * #TRACK now <what’s being discussed>

     * example: #swift now brainstorming improvements to the ring.

     * Cross project interactions #TRACK now <what’s being discussed with
       other #TRACK>:

     * #nova now discussing #cinder interactions

     * What’s next #TRACK next <what will be discussed>:

     * #api-sig next at 2pm we’ll be discussing pagination woes

     * Clear all now and next entries for a track #TRACK clean:

     * #ironic clean

Booking Reservable Rooms

   Reservable rooms and what’s being discussed works the same with it
   showing on the event schedule page [0].
   Different set of commands:
     * Get the slot codes with the book command:

     * #TRACK book

     * #TRACK book <slot_code>

     * example: #relmgt book Coiste Bainisti-MonP2

   Any track can book additional space. These slots are 1 hour and 45
   minutes long. You can ask ttx, diablo_rojo or #openstack-infra to add a
   track that’s missing. Keep in mind various teams will be soley relying
   on this for space at the PTG.
   Additional commands can be found in the PTG bot README [1].

PTL Election Results and Conclusions

   PTL election is over and the results are in [0]! Congrats to returning
   and new PTLs!
   There were three elections that took place:
     * Kolla [1]

     * Mistral [2]

     * Quality Assurance [3]

   On the statistics side, we renewed 17 of the 64 PTLs, so around 27%.
   Our usual renewal rate is more around 35%, but we did renew more at the
   last elections (40%) so this is likely why we didn’t renew as much as
   usual this time. Much thanks to our election officials for carrying out
   this important responsibility in our community!

Election Process Tweaks

   Discussions have started with ways to improve our election process.
   Current scripts in place have become brittle that are needed for
   governance documentation building that use gerrit lookup functions.
   Election officials currently have to make changes to an exception file
   [0] when email address with foundation accounts don’t match gerrit.
   Discussed improvements include:
     * Uncouple TC and PTL election processes.

     * Make TC and PTL validation functions separate.

     * Change how-to-submit-candidacy directions to requires candidates
       email address to match their gerrit and foundation account.

   Comments, concerns and better ideas are welcome. The plan is to
   schedule time at the PTG to start hacking on some of those items so
   feedback before then would be appreciated by your election officials!

Last Chance for PTG Dublin Tickets

   PTG tickets for Dublin were sold out this week, and the Foundation
   received many requests for more tickets. Working with the venue to
   accommodate the extra capacity, every additional attendee incrementally
   increases costs to $600. It’s understood the importance of this event
   and the need to have key team members present, so the OpenStack
   Foundation has negotiated an additional 100 tickets and will partially
   subsidize to be at sold at $400 [0].

New Zuul Depends-On Syntax

   Recently introduced url-based syntax for Depends-On: footer in your
   commit message:

       Depends-On: https://review.openstack.org/535851
   Old syntax will continue to work for a while, but please begin using
   the new syntax. Zuul has grown the ability to talk to multiple backend
   systems (Gerrit, Git and plain Git so far).
   From a change in gerrit you could have:
       Depends-On:
   https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/sphinxcontrib-openapi/pull/17

   Or from a Github pull request:
       Depends-On: https://review.openstack.org/536159

Community Goals for Rocky

   So far one goal has been proposed by Kendall Nelson for migrating to
   Storyboard. It was agreed to postpone the goal until the S cycle, as it
   could take longer than six months to achieve. There is a good backlog
   of goals [0], just no champions. It’ll be bad for momentum if we have a
   cycle with no community wide goal.

PTG Post-lunch Presentations

   Feedback received from past PTG session(s) was the lack of situational
   awareness and missed opportunity for “global” communication at the
   event. In Dublin we’d used the end of the lunch break to for
   communications that could be interesting to OpenStack upstream
   developers and project team members. The idea is not to find a
   presentation for everyday, but if we find content that is generally
   useful. Interesting topics include general guidance to make the most of
   the PTG weeks (good Monday content), development tricks, code review
   etiquette, new library features you should adopt, lightning talks (good
   Friday content). We’d like to keep the slot under 20 minutes. If you
   have ideas please fill out this etherpad [0] in a few weeks.

   week in Sydney. Thank you to all who attended!

   You can catch all the action from the Keynotes here. The Summit talk
   videos are live, find them here. Superuser also covered the Summit with
   an awesome article covering 50 things you need to know.

   Next Summit

   quick. Don’t miss out and secure yours today.

   On the final day of the Sydney Summit, the Community Contributor Awards
   gave a special tip of the hat to those who might not know how much they
   are valued. Read more about the ceremony here.

   Containers delivers increased performance, faster boot time and cost
   efficiencies. Kata Containers will have its own governance, community
   and communication channels.

   HPC book update

   The Scientific Working Group has updated the Crossroads of Cloud and
   HPC: OpenStack for Scientific Research. Version 2 of the popular book
   details multiple enhancements made to OpenStack for HPC workloads over
   the past year and added several new in-depth case studies on how
   OpenStack supports radio astronomy, bioinformatics, cancer and genome
   research and more. Read or order the book at
   https://www.openstack.org/science/ to find out exactly how OpenStack
   allows researchers to spend less time managing infrastructure and more
   time on research that matters. To learn more or get involved in the
   Scientific Working Group, visit
