Researcher suggests pesticide may be linked to insect, bird declines

   Biologist Christy Morrissey is raising concerns about the new class of
   pesticide. (CBC)

   A University of Saskatchewan biologist says many wetlands across the
   Prairies are being contaminated by a relatively new pesticide that is
   threatening the ecosystem.

   Christy Morrissey says that over the past few years neonicotinoids have
   been used increasingly on crops in Western Canada and the chemical is
   making its way into wetlands, potentially having a devastating "domino
   effect" on insects and the birds that rely on them.

     The impact on biodiversity could be probably bigger than we've ever
     seen before.—​Christy Morrissey, biologist

   Morrissey is just a year and a half into a four-year study, but she's
   alarmed by what she's finding.

   "This is huge" Morrissey said. "The impact on biodiversity could be
   probably bigger than we've ever seen before if we keep going at this
   rate."

   Neonics, as they're commonly called, hit the market in the early 2000s,
   but sales have taken off over the past five years.

   They're used on a wide variety of crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat,
   oats, barley, potatoes and fruit. In Western Canada, neonics are most
   commonly found on canola. Virtually all of the 8.5 million hectares of
   canola planted in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta are now treated
   with them.

   Based on confidential data obtained from the federal government,
   Morrissey said her conservative estimate is 44 per cent of crop land in
   the Prairies was treated with neonics in the year she reviewed.

   "We're not talking about a little regional problem. We're talking about
   something that's happening over tens of millions of acres."

   Morrissey said her study is the first in Canada looking at how the
   widespread use of this chemical may be affecting wetlands across the
   Prairies.

Neonics 'contaminating' western wetlands

   Her research has found the chemical is commonly showing up in wetlands
   in concentrations at least three to four times higher than what has
   been deemed habitable for insects.

   "In some cases we have peak concentrations that are 100 times or more
   higher than those benchmarks of safe levels." Morrissey said. She and
   her fellow researchers have sampled hundreds of wetlands and have found
   that "upwards of 80 to 90 per cent of the wetlands are contaminated."

   Most alarming, she said, is that the chemical was detected in the water
   before farmers planted in the spring. Morrissey said her research shows
   neonics are persisting in the water for months and in some cases years.
   She said that is likely to be devastating to insects.

   "The longer that the chemical is in the water the longer the exposure
   time for the bugs. So they basically are being hit continuously with
   the chemical."

Insect and bird populations may be affected

   Morrissey said preliminary data suggests just what she suspected: an
   apparent decline in mosquito and midge populations, which could have
   serious ramifications for birds.

   "So birds that are flying around, they are primarily eating midges and
   mosquitos," Morrissey said. "The ducks in the ponds, they are reliant
   on the midges, for example. So we know that these insects are basically
   the food supply for a lot of wildlife."
   Neonicotinoids have been blamed for declines in bee populations.
   Morrissey said there's plenty of evidence to show bird and insect
   populations are declining, but she acknowledges it's not yet clear if
   neonicotinoids are playing any role. Morrissey said she's attempting to
   learn how all of these pieces fit together.

   "It's forensics, really, to see whether or not this one is causing the
   other. That takes a considerable amount of careful experimentation."

     We all want to have food that we consume and enjoy. But at what
     cost?—Christy Morrissey, biologist

   She said she's approaching this work with a real sense of urgency,
   because of how quickly neonics have become the pesticide of choice.

   "We all want to have food that we consume and enjoy. But at what cost?"
   Morrissey wonders. "Is that at the cost of having no more birds around?
   Of having no more butterflies? Having no bees? People are thinking
   about that now."

Former government scientist calls for neonic ban

   Morrissey isn't alone in her concerns. In March 2013, American Bird
   Conservancy published a paper citing data from Canada, California and
   the Netherlands claiming "that concentrations of several of the
   neonicotinoid insecticides are high enough to be causing impacts in
   aquatic food chains."

   The paper is titled "The Impact of the Nation's Most Widely Used
   Insecticides on Birds." It was written by Pierre Mineau, a former
   senior research scientist specializing in pesticide ecotoxicology with
   Environment Canada, and an adjunct professor at Carleton University and
   the University of Saskatchewan.

   The paper refers to Morrissey's research and other findings that led
   Mineau to conclude "it is clear that we are witnessing contamination of
   the aquatic environment at levels that will affect aquatic food chains.
   This has a potential to affect consumers of those aquatic resources, be
   they birds, fish or amphibians."

   Mineau criticizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its
   continued approval of new neonicotinoids for use in that country.

   "EPA risk assessments have greatly underestimated this risk, using
   scientifically unsound, outdated methodology that has more to do with a
   game of chance than with a rigorous scientific process."

   Mineau said concerns about neonics have now led the American Bird
   Conservancy and partners in the National Pesticide Reform coalition to
   urge the EPA to ban the use of neonics as seed treatments and do a
   thorough review of their effects on the ecosystem.

   Despite these concerns, there is not unanimity in the scientific
   community regarding the reasons behind declining bird and insect
   populations. Another study by Mineau points out that "most
   investigators have blamed farmland bird declines on some aspect of
   agricultural intensification."

   In other words, declining bird populations could be explained by farms
   that are larger and more dense than in the past, and as a result
   wildlife is losing its previous habitat.

   Other scientists blame the decline on increased predation, which they
   argue is also a consequence of changes in habitat.

Neonics more environmentally friendly, industry says

   The companies that manufacture neonicotinoids, Bayer CropScience and
   Syngenta, say their products have been rigorously tested and were found
   to be safe before they were introduced into the market.

   CropLife Canada is an industry group that speaks on behalf of those
   companies. It said there's no reason to believe that neonics persist in
   water over long periods of time.

   "The companies have done studies in Europe and in North America where
   they've applied the product consecutively for 10 years and have seen no
   accumulation, no bioaccumulation." explained CropLife Canada's Pierre
   Petelle. "And they've also seen no persistence beyond the levels that
   you would expect in a field for one year."

     The levels that would be detected under normal use won't pose a
     problem.—Pierre Petelle, CropLife Canada

   And so, while he hasn't yet seen Morrissey's data, he's quite sure,
   based on previous research, that it won't identify significant concerns
   with neonics.

   "We're confident that the levels that would be detected under normal
   use won't pose a problem. So we would love to discuss these data with
   the researchers."

   Petelle said that neonics, far from causing harm, are a welcome
   replacement to older sprayed-on pesticides that were potentially
   harmful to humans and animals.

   "This class of insecticide [neonicotiniods] had extremely low toxicity
   to humans, extremely low toxicity to other mammals as well as birds and
   fish."

   Petelle said the coated seeds make a lot of sense because they do away
   with the possibility of overspray and allow farmers to avoid multiple
   applications of pesticides throughout the growing season.

   But Morrissey said that it's still quite possible farmers are applying
   more chemical to their fields now, using these treated seeds.

   "Obviously the disadvantage from an environmental perspective is that
   every single plant is treated whether it needs it or not."
   said Morrissey. "So now you have a situation where large tracts of land
   are basically treated when they may or may not need to be treated."

Neonics embroiled in global bee controversy

   Until now, neonics have primarily raised environmental concerns because
   of their perceived effect on bees.

   In April of last year the European Union placed a two-year trial ban on
   the chemical because of complaints from beekeepers about dramatically
   declining populations, and scientific evidence that may show neonics
   are partly to blame.

     The problem here is that now you've got activist groups who've got a
     very clear anti-pesticide perspective.—Pierre Petelle,
     CropLife Canada

   CropLife Canada said the ban was a reaction to overheated rhetoric.

   "The problem here is that now you've got activist groups who've got a
   very clear anti-pesticide perspective and they don't hide that,"
   Petelle said. "And it's unfortunate."

   He said there's no unambiguous evidence to suggest that neonics are to
   blame for the decline in bee populations.

No neonic ban in Canada

   Unlike Europe, which has moved to ban neonics, the Canadian government
   said in an email to CBC "we do not feel a suspension is warranted at
   this time."

   However, Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Authority has
   publicly raised concerns about the pesticide, and its possible effect
   on bees in the corn-growing regions of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba.

   In the statement, Health Canada said its research shows "the use of
   neonicotinoid treated corn and soybean seed are affecting the
   environment due to their impact on bees and other pollinators."

   It found that about 70 per cent of dead bee samples tested positive for
   neonic residue, whereas the chemical was detected in one sample of
   unaffected bees.

   "We concluded that the majority of pollinator mortalities were a result
   of exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides" the report said.

   And so Ottawa is now publicly consulting on new proposed standards for
   safer planting practices and enhanced warning labels on soybean and
   corn seed treated with the pesticide. It is also conducting a detailed
   scientific re-evaluation of the effects of neonics on bees, which will
   be released this year.

   While not commenting directly on Morrissey's research, Health Canada
   does say that "the overall potential effects of neonicotinoid
   insecticides to Canada's ecosystem are one of the topics that will be
   examined as part of the broader re-evaluation, which is currently
   underway."

About the series

   KIM’S CONVENIENCE, the funny, heartfelt story of the Kim family and
   their downtown convenience store, returns for a third season. Appa
   (PAUL SUN-HYUNG LEE) and Umma (JEAN YOON) try to be good parents and
   good partners whether spicing up their love life, navigating the
   unfamiliar landscape of couples therapy or discovering the pitfalls of
   shants (shorts + pants). Janet (ANDREA BANG) continues to launch her
   career as a photographer, while negotiating old flames and new
   roommates. And Jung (SIMU LIU) struggles to regain his job and his
   friendship with Shannon (NICOLE POWER) while awkwardly mending fences
   with his Appa.

   The series stars Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Appa, Jean Yoon as Umma, Simu
   Liu as Jung, Andrea Bang as Janet, and Andrew Phung as Kimchee. KIM'S
   CONVENIENCE is based on the award-winning play by Ins Choi, who also
   adapted it for television. Kevin White serves as showrunner, and
   co-created the series with Choi, who both hold executive producer
   credits along with Ivan Fecan.

Pesticide 'contaminating' Prairie wetlands: scientist

   being contaminated by a relatively new pesticide that is threatening
   the ecosystem.

Researcher suggests pesticide may be linked to insect, bird declines

   Biologist Christy Morrissey is raising concerns about the new class of
   pesticide. (CBC)

   A University of Saskatchewan biologist says many wetlands across the
   Prairies are being contaminated by a relatively new pesticide that is
   threatening the ecosystem.

   Christy Morrissey says that over the past few years neonicotinoids have
   been used increasingly on crops in Western Canada and the chemical is
   making its way into wetlands, potentially having a devastating "domino
   effect" on insects and the birds that rely on them.

     The impact on biodiversity could be probably bigger than we've ever
     seen before.—​Christy Morrissey, biologist

   Morrissey is just a year and a half into a four-year study, but she's
   alarmed by what she's finding.

   "This is huge" Morrissey said. "The impact on biodiversity could be
   probably bigger than we've ever seen before if we keep going at this
   rate."

   Neonics, as they're commonly called, hit the market in the early 2000s,
   but sales have taken off over the past five years.

   They're used on a wide variety of crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat,
   oats, barley, potatoes and fruit. In Western Canada, neonics are most
   commonly found on canola. Virtually all of the 8.5 million hectares of
   canola planted in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta are now treated
   with them.

   Based on confidential data obtained from the federal government,
   Morrissey said her conservative estimate is 44 per cent of crop land in
   the Prairies was treated with neonics in the year she reviewed.

   "We're not talking about a little regional problem. We're talking about
   something that's happening over tens of millions of acres."

   Morrissey said her study is the first in Canada looking at how the
   widespread use of this chemical may be affecting wetlands across the
   Prairies.

Neonics 'contaminating' western wetlands

   Her research has found the chemical is commonly showing up in wetlands
   in concentrations at least three to four times higher than what has
   been deemed habitable for insects.

   "In some cases we have peak concentrations that are 100 times or more
   higher than those benchmarks of safe levels." Morrissey said. She and
   her fellow researchers have sampled hundreds of wetlands and have found
   that "upwards of 80 to 90 per cent of the wetlands are contaminated."

   Most alarming, she said, is that the chemical was detected in the water
   before farmers planted in the spring. Morrissey said her research shows
   neonics are persisting in the water for months and in some cases years.
   She said that is likely to be devastating to insects.

   "The longer that the chemical is in the water the longer the exposure
   time for the bugs. So they basically are being hit continuously with
   the chemical."

Insect and bird populations may be affected

   Morrissey said preliminary data suggests just what she suspected: an
   apparent decline in mosquito and midge populations, which could have
   serious ramifications for birds.

   "So birds that are flying around, they are primarily eating midges and
   mosquitos," Morrissey said. "The ducks in the ponds, they are reliant
   on the midges, for example. So we know that these insects are basically
   the food supply for a lot of wildlife."
   Neonicotinoids have been blamed for declines in bee populations.
   Morrissey said there's plenty of evidence to show bird and insect
   populations are declining, but she acknowledges it's not yet clear if
   neonicotinoids are playing any role. Morrissey said she's attempting to
   learn how all of these pieces fit together.

   "It's forensics, really, to see whether or not this one is causing the
   other. That takes a considerable amount of careful experimentation."

     We all want to have food that we consume and enjoy. But at what
     cost?—Christy Morrissey, biologist

   She said she's approaching this work with a real sense of urgency,
   because of how quickly neonics have become the pesticide of choice.

   "We all want to have food that we consume and enjoy. But at what cost?"
   Morrissey wonders. "Is that at the cost of having no more birds around?
   Of having no more butterflies? Having no bees? People are thinking
   about that now."

Former government scientist calls for neonic ban

   Morrissey isn't alone in her concerns. In March 2013, American Bird
   Conservancy published a paper citing data from Canada, California and
   the Netherlands claiming "that concentrations of several of the
   neonicotinoid insecticides are high enough to be causing impacts in
   aquatic food chains."

   The paper is titled "The Impact of the Nation's Most Widely Used
   Insecticides on Birds." It was written by Pierre Mineau, a former
   senior research scientist specializing in pesticide ecotoxicology with
   Environment Canada, and an adjunct professor at Carleton University and
   the University of Saskatchewan.

   The paper refers to Morrissey's research and other findings that led
   Mineau to conclude "it is clear that we are witnessing contamination of
   the aquatic environment at levels that will affect aquatic food chains.
   This has a potential to affect consumers of those aquatic resources, be
   they birds, fish or amphibians."

   Mineau criticizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its
   continued approval of new neonicotinoids for use in that country.

   "EPA risk assessments have greatly underestimated this risk, using
   scientifically unsound, outdated methodology that has more to do with a
   game of chance than with a rigorous scientific process."

   Mineau said concerns about neonics have now led the American Bird
   Conservancy and partners in the National Pesticide Reform coalition to
   urge the EPA to ban the use of neonics as seed treatments and do a
   thorough review of their effects on the ecosystem.

   Despite these concerns, there is not unanimity in the scientific
   community regarding the reasons behind declining bird and insect
   populations. Another study by Mineau points out that "most
   investigators have blamed farmland bird declines on some aspect of
   agricultural intensification."

   In other words, declining bird populations could be explained by farms
   that are larger and more dense than in the past, and as a result
   wildlife is losing its previous habitat.

   Other scientists blame the decline on increased predation, which they
   argue is also a consequence of changes in habitat.

Neonics more environmentally friendly, industry says

   The companies that manufacture neonicotinoids, Bayer CropScience and
   Syngenta, say their products have been rigorously tested and were found
   to be safe before they were introduced into the market.

   CropLife Canada is an industry group that speaks on behalf of those
   companies. It said there's no reason to believe that neonics persist in
   water over long periods of time.

   "The companies have done studies in Europe and in North America where
   they've applied the product consecutively for 10 years and have seen no
   accumulation, no bioaccumulation." explained CropLife Canada's Pierre
   Petelle. "And they've also seen no persistence beyond the levels that
   you would expect in a field for one year."

     The levels that would be detected under normal use won't pose a
     problem.—Pierre Petelle, CropLife Canada

   And so, while he hasn't yet seen Morrissey's data, he's quite sure,
   based on previous research, that it won't identify significant concerns
   with neonics.

   "We're confident that the levels that would be detected under normal
   use won't pose a problem. So we would love to discuss these data with
   the researchers."

   Petelle said that neonics, far from causing harm, are a welcome
   replacement to older sprayed-on pesticides that were potentially
   harmful to humans and animals.

   "This class of insecticide [neonicotiniods] had extremely low toxicity
   to humans, extremely low toxicity to other mammals as well as birds and
   fish."

   Petelle said the coated seeds make a lot of sense because they do away
   with the possibility of overspray and allow farmers to avoid multiple
   applications of pesticides throughout the growing season.

   But Morrissey said that it's still quite possible farmers are applying
   more chemical to their fields now, using these treated seeds.

   "Obviously the disadvantage from an environmental perspective is that
   every single plant is treated whether it needs it or not."
   said Morrissey. "So now you have a situation where large tracts of land
   are basically treated when they may or may not need to be treated."

Neonics embroiled in global bee controversy

   Until now, neonics have primarily raised environmental concerns because
   of their perceived effect on bees.

   In April of last year the European Union placed a two-year trial ban on
   the chemical because of complaints from beekeepers about dramatically
   declining populations, and scientific evidence that may show neonics
   are partly to blame.

     The problem here is that now you've got activist groups who've got a
     very clear anti-pesticide perspective.—Pierre Petelle,
     CropLife Canada

   CropLife Canada said the ban was a reaction to overheated rhetoric.

   "The problem here is that now you've got activist groups who've got a
   very clear anti-pesticide perspective and they don't hide that,"
   Petelle said. "And it's unfortunate."

   He said there's no unambiguous evidence to suggest that neonics are to
   blame for the decline in bee populations.

No neonic ban in Canada

   Unlike Europe, which has moved to ban neonics, the Canadian government
   said in an email to CBC "we do not feel a suspension is warranted at
   this time."

   However, Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Authority has
   publicly raised concerns about the pesticide, and its possible effect
   on bees in the corn-growing regions of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba.

   In the statement, Health Canada said its research shows "the use of
   neonicotinoid treated corn and soybean seed are affecting the
   environment due to their impact on bees and other pollinators."

   It found that about 70 per cent of dead bee samples tested positive for
   neonic residue, whereas the chemical was detected in one sample of
   unaffected bees.

   "We concluded that the majority of pollinator mortalities were a result
   of exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides" the report said.

   And so Ottawa is now publicly consulting on new proposed standards for
   safer planting practices and enhanced warning labels on soybean and
   corn seed treated with the pesticide. It is also conducting a detailed
   scientific re-evaluation of the effects of neonics on bees, which will
   be released this year.

   While not commenting directly on Morrissey's research, Health Canada
   does say that "the overall potential effects of neonicotinoid
   insecticides to Canada's ecosystem are one of the topics that will be
   examined as part of the broader re-evaluation, which is currently
   underway."

About the series

   KIM’S CONVENIENCE, the funny, heartfelt story of the Kim family and
   their downtown convenience store, returns for a third season. Appa
   (PAUL SUN-HYUNG LEE) and Umma (JEAN YOON) try to be good parents and
   good partners whether spicing up their love life, navigating the
   unfamiliar landscape of couples therapy or discovering the pitfalls of
   shants (shorts + pants). Janet (ANDREA BANG) continues to launch her
   career as a photographer, while negotiating old flames and new
   roommates. And Jung (SIMU LIU) struggles to regain his job and his
   friendship with Shannon (NICOLE POWER) while awkwardly mending fences
   with his Appa.

   The series stars Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Appa, Jean Yoon as Umma, Simu
   Liu as Jung, Andrea Bang as Janet, and Andrew Phung as Kimchee. KIM'S
   CONVENIENCE is based on the award-winning play by Ins Choi, who also
   adapted it for television. Kevin White serves as showrunner, and
   co-created the series with Choi, who both hold executive producer
   credits along with Ivan Fecan.
