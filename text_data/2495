Welcome To Elephant Valley Thailand

   We have been hard at work to build the first ever elephant sanctuary in
   Chiang Rai!

   Covering 40 acres of land we have some fantastic lush elephant habitat
   on which we look after our gorgeous elephant herd.

   This is actually the second elephant sanctuary we have built and all of
   the work we do here is modeled on the  incredible Elephant Valley
   Project, in Cambodia.

   Our homestay is now open and we are excited to welcome you to come and
   relax, unwind, watch elephants and volunteer, surrounded by the
   tranquil beauty of our property ! Check it Out

   To learn more information about what we do, please explore our website
   and if you are in or on your way to Chiang Rai then please feel free to
   book an elephant visit and come and learn about our AMAZING animals
   here at Elephant Valley Thailand!
