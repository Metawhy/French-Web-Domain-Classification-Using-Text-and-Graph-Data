Next-gen telehealth: AI, chatbots, genomics and sensors that advance
population health

   Telemedicine platforms and tools will transform virtual care by
   incorporating emerging technologies and novel uses of data.

   While the use of telemedicine systems has been expanding in recent
   years, especially as more payers have begun reimbursing for some
   telehealth services, the industry is on the verge of more widespread
   virtual care.

   But what will that ultimately look like? The next generation of tools
   will feature enhancements ranging from chatbots, machine learning and
   genomics to remote diagnostic tools and better sensors.

   Here’s a look at what to expect in the near future.

Machine learning and chatbots effective, but only in specific cases

   Both machine learning and automation are trying to solve an inherent
   issue in virtual healthcare: scalability, said Roeen Roashan, senior
   analyst of digital health at consulting firm IHS.

   “Virtual health technology is not scalable by nature, and this has in
   fact been a major limitation for more than two decades,” Roashan said.
   “In remote patient monitoring, you still need a rather significant
   workforce to support the value chain. Machine learning is making its
   way to remote patient monitoring. Companies like PhysIQ and Sentrian
   offer solutions that make better use of clinical workforce when
   monitoring patients remotely by automatically tracking whether a
   baseline for the individual patient is improving or not. This improves
   scalability by a factor of 7x or 8x.”

"Machine learning is making its way to remote patient monitoring."

   Roeen Roashan, IHS

   To truly reach scalability, certain functions of virtual healthcare
   must be decomposed and outsourced back to the patient, he added.
   Therefore, one needs automation, and systems that are led by the
   patient, but where the value is driven by, for example, chatbots, he
   said.

   “In certain cases, these chatbots create higher relative value than
   human personnel,” Roashan said. “For instance, in one study focusing on
   building mental resilience among youth, a chatbot delivered stunning
   results. Users who chatted with Wysa had a 45 percent reduction in
   depression, and medication adherence rose by 10x.”

   This is not to say that mental health is better delivered through
   chatbots but, rather, that certain aspects of care should be automated.
   These mental health patients actually preferred to speak with a bot,
   and most conversations took place between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., often
   including taboo topics, Roashan explained.

   “Chatbots can deliver value, but only in some parts of the healthcare
   value chain,” he said. “The next big step for these automated services
   is to include voice, and there are plenty of companies working with
   Alexa to do exactly this.”

AI will be transformative for healthcare

   As Roashan believes machine learning has a role to play in the next
   generation of telemedicine technology, Joel Barthelemy, founder and CEO
   of GlobalMed, a telemedicine technology vendor, added that artificial
   intelligence can dramatically improve telehealth.

   “AI will transform primary care via telemedicine,” he contended. “The
   rise of machine learning will enable ‘AI engines’ to take over much of
   the care now provided by primary care doctors. Represented by a
   human-like avatar, an AI engine will remotely lead patients through a
   sequence of questions similar to – but more comprehensive than – the
   ones that primary care physicians and nurses now ask about symptoms and
   health histories in office visits.”

"With the advent of genomic medicine, telemedicine will be used to provide
much more personalized care to people based on their genetic characteristics.
"

   Joel Barthelemy, GlobalMed

   The AI engine will tailor these questions to what it already knows
   about the patients and what their answers reveal, he added. It will not
   ask questions that other providers have already asked because the
   answers will be online in the patient’s personal health record, he
   explained.

   “The AI engine will also take advantage of video conferencing to
   inspect patients’ skin and observe their general health condition,”
   Barthelemy said. “It also will consider the results of home and mobile
   vital signs monitoring on inexpensive devices and wearable sensors. A
   ‘lab on a chip’ might even be used for instant blood tests, the results
   of which could be transmitted to the AI engine.”
   Webinar: Fall prevention: Telehealth from setup to application

   Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not allow a
   device to diagnose a patient without the input of a physician. But an
   AI engine could say there’s an 84 percent chance that a patient’s
   stomach symptoms are related to the flu and that there’s a 4 percent
   chance they are due to indigestion. A doctor could receive this report
   and decide whether or not he or she agrees, Barthelemy said.

   “An AI engine also is not allowed to prescribe drugs, and that is
   unlikely to change in the foreseeable future,” he said. “But, based on
   the experience of many thousands of similar patients with the same
   symptoms and signs, the AI engine could advise the doctor on which
   medication to prescribe or which treatment to try. As these learning
   machines become more and more accurate, doctors will agree with them
   most of the time unless they know something unique about a patient.”

   In that case, they might contact the patient and ask some more
   questions; but in most cases, patients will no longer have to see
   primary care doctors in person, he contended.

New sensors will show up in more places

   On another front, sensor technologies built into households and
   consumer electronics that can trigger consumption of as-needed medical
   services may be about to change population health forever, said Roy
   Schoenberg, MD, CEO and co-founder of American Well, a telemedicine
   technology vendor.

"This real-time loop that combines sensors, analytics and telemedicine marks
the transition from passive to proactive healthcare."

   Roy Schoenberg, MD, American Well

   “We see this with Apple’s new heart study with Stanford Medicine, where
   Apple Watch detects cardiac issues and magically prompts a telehealth
   doctor to show up on the patient’s phone to initiate a medical
   intervention within minutes,” he said. “This kind of real-time loop –
   that combines sensors, analytics and telemedicine – in my mind marks
   the transition from passive healthcare, which engages with the
   patient’s ‘chief complaint,’ to proactive healthcare, which dispatches
   live care as problems are detected.”

   The implications will extend not only to how people experience care,
   but also to the practice of medicine, healthcare cost, healthcare
   policy, and quite likely how people age and longevity, he added.

Genomics, diagnostics and remote monitoring

   Another next-generation feature of telemedicine will be genomic
   therapy, Barthelemy said.

   “Today, telemedicine is used to consult with specialists who may be
   thousands of miles away from the patient,” he said. “With the advent of
   genomic medicine, telemedicine will be used to provide much more
   personalized care to people, based on their genetic characteristics.
   This will require patients to go to nearby medical centers that are
   equipped with low-cost genomic sequencing equipment.”

   Based on a patient’s genetic makeup, and what is known about how
   patients like them respond to various therapies, a group of
   geographically scattered doctors who are being advised by AI engines
   will use telemedicine to confer and quickly decide how best to diagnose
   and treat that patient, he explained.

   And a new breed of remote telemonitoring and diagnostic tools that
   allow patients and physicians to interact in a way that closely mimics
   an in-person experience will highlight the next generation of
   telehealth, said Cory Costley, chief product officer and co-founder at
   Avizia, a telemedicine technology vendor.

   “Today, there are a handful of telehealth platforms equipped with
   state-of-the-art functionalities, such as enhanced far-end camera
   control and real-time data from connected peripherals to empower a
   remote physician to examine a patient’s physical appearance and capture
   images or sounds of the body,” Costley said.

   Five years ago, some of these diagnostic examinations weren’t possible
   at such a high level, he said.

   “Tools like these truly bridge the gap between what you can do remotely
   and what you can’t do remotely,” Costley said. “The technology is very
   timely, too, as growing physician shortages in many parts of the
   country have exacerbated healthcare access problems.”
