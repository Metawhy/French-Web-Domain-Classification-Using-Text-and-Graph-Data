Frankenstein Treat Bag - First Silhouette Cameo 4 Project

   Received my Cameo 4 today and I'm very happy with it. I was excited at
   first when I ordered it but then a little nervous when I heard about
   the software issue. I'm happy to say I had no problem setting it up,
   the Bluetooth paired, firmware updated and software version 4.3.263
   works, so I'm very pleased. I wanted to test it out quickly so I put
   together this treat bag using a couple of files from the Silhouette
   Design Store and it cut beautifully and super fast. I have a Cricut
   Maker that I do love but I rather the silhouette studio software, I
   have the business edition so I design in ssbe, save as an svg and bring
   into design space to cut, so this will save me some steps.

Christmas Tree Card - Spellbinders

   I can't believe how quickly the summer is flying by, next thing you
   know the kids will be back in school. I really haven't worked too much
   on craft projects this summer, but I did want to get at least one
   Christmas in July project accomplished. I used Spellbinder's June Small
   Die of the Month to create a Christmas tree along with some
   embellishments from the November 2018 Card Kit of the Month. There are
   so many things you can do with these dies, I think my next will be a
   try at a peacock.

Jungle Gift Set - Doodlebug Design Team Project

   Here's a cute gift set using one of my favorite collections for kid
   birthday cards, At the Zoo. It's filled with so many adorable animals,
   kids just love the cards made using this fun and wild collection.
   [dd_jungle-01_bmann.jpg]
   The toucan is definitely a favorite, I made him into a semi-shaped card
   using the cut file,(svg, silhouette). The sentiment is from the at the
   zoo 6x6 paper pad, these come in so handy for my cards.
   [dd_jungle-03_bmann.jpg]
   The box is super simple, I used one from the Silhouette Design Store
   and cut it out using at the zoo animal crackers paper, added some
   limeade twine and a sticker from the this and that sticker sheet.
