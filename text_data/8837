   News from MEMORIAM
   20th April 2019
   https://youtu.be/2olgPmHY-84
    The war rages on! Old school metal veterans MEMORIAM are set to
   unleash their third album, Requiem For Mankind, on June 21st, 2019 via
   Nuclear Blast Records. Today, the band have revealed the lyric video
   for new track 'Shell Shock'.
   The band states:
   "A new Memoriam song, a new approach, and as with all our albums a new
   sound for us to use.
   "Shell shock " is the first track we recorded for the "Requiem For
   Mankind" album. It is a bit of a
   Death Metal headbanger of a track! Subject wise it deals with the
   effects of being on the frontline
   amongst all the noise and chaos of a horrific war situation from an
   individual standpoint, and also
   that the soldier does not die from an enemy bullet!
   Sound wise it needed to sound a bit epic, we think we have achieved
   this on 'Shellshock' and
   have used this as the blueprint sound throughout the album."
   Pre-order the album here: http://nblast.de/Memoriam-RFM
   The digital single 'Shell Shock' will be available tomorrow, April
   19th, on all streaming platforms.
   The tracklist for Requiem For Mankind racks up as follows:
   01. Shell Shock
   02. Undefeated
   03. Never The Victim
   04. Austerity Kills
   05. In The Midst Of Desolation
   06. Refuse To Be Led
   07. The Veteran
   08. Requiem For Mankind
   09. Fixed Bayonets
   10. Interment
   The album's impressive artwork was created again by Dan Seagrave
   (BENEDICTION, DISMEMBER, HYPOCRISY, SUFFOCATION,...).
   The colossal songwriting and the first-class recordings have been
   immortalised through the sublime production work of Russ Russell
   (NAPALM DEATH, DIMMU BORGIR, AT THE GATES, AMORPHIS, etc.) at Parlour
   Studios, giving the record raw production values, whilst providing the
   perfect scenario to showcase the musicianship so beautifully displayed
   on the album.
   Memoriam were also pleased to announce their debut London show last
   week – which will also be the release show for their upcoming studio
   album. The gig will be taking place at The Underworld, Camden on June
   22nd this summer. Supports to be announced in due course.
   12th April 2019- Little more than one year has passed since Memoriam
   UK's album "The Silent Vigil" was released, but as we all know, there’s
   no standing still in the MEMORIAM camp. Their third studio album
   "Requiem For Mankind" will be released on June 21st, 2019.
   The album's impressive artwork was created again by master Dan
   Seagrave.
   While their debut album "For The Fallen" (2017) was heavy, depressing,
   and marked by grief, the second work "The Silent Vigil" (2018) showed a
   relentlessly aggressive side. This also applies to the third and latest
   string to their bow "Requiem For Mankind."

   The album's formidable artwork was created once again by Dan Seagrave
   (BENEDICTION, DISMEMBER, HYPOCRISY, SUFFOCATION,...).
   »The Silent Vigil« - Tracklisting:
   1. Soulless Parasite
   2. Nothing Remains
   3. From the Flames
   4. The Silent Vigil
   5. Bleed The Same
   6. As Bridges Burn
   7. The New Dark Ages
   8. No Known Grave
   9. Weaponised Fear

   MEMORIAM stated on the cover artwork:
   "Following the success of working with Dan Seagrave for our debut album
   »For The Fallen«, we decided that we had to get Dan involved for the
   next album cover.
   Initially we used Dan as we were all very impressed with the art that
   he has created for bands over the decades and Scott in particular
   wanted to have an album cover designed by Dan Seagrave, as part of the
   things he wanted to achieve with MEMORIAM.
   Dan really encapsulates the Old School Death Metal feel to the album
   covers that he creates; they are full of detail and very atmospheric.
   We gave him a brief for the »For The Fallen« debut cover and he did a
   great job.
   We briefed Dan and asked him to create an image which followed on from
   the first album; the first album features a funeral procession, the
   coffin of the fallen leader paraded across an ethereal battle scarred
   landscape.
   »The Silent Vigil« represents the next phase of the journey where the
   coffin is lying in state with the followers standing in silence almost
   like terracotta soldiers. The cover has an overall solemn feel to it,
   with the ravaged landscape in the background and burnt out wrecks of
   military hardware in the foreground.
   The tree in the centre of the album cover is symbolic of life – that
   continues on.
   We are really pleased with what Dan Seagrave has created for us once
   again and we are proud to have his artwork on our album cover.
   We already have an idea for the next album cover and we hope that
   Dan will be able to do this for us too."
   Memoriam are an Old School Death Metal band and maintain the standards
   set by previous bands that the members have played with, focusing on
   the themes of death, loss and war.

   Initially Memoriam got together to play covers of songs that had
   influenced them throughout their careers within the Death Metal scene,
   however it soon became apparent that the new songs that they created
   were of a superior standard.

   2016 proved to be a busy year for Memoriam, establishing themselves
   through the release of the Hellfire Demos

   2017 saw Memoriam release the Hellfire Demos II in January followed by
   their hugely anticipated debut album 'For The Fallen' through Nuclear
   Blast Records in March. This was followed by 20 selected shows
   throughout Europe in that year.
   In December 2017 Memoriam headed to RB studios to record the second
   album ' The silent Vigil' which is to be released through Nuclear Blast
   Records in March 2018.

   2018 will be another great year for Memoriam a true celebration of life
   through Death Metal.

   Onward into battle…The war still rages on…….

   The speed at which MEMORIAM operate and the pace they've kept up since
   their formation has kept jaws perpetually on the floor. Officially
   brought to life in March 2016, just a few weeks later their debut two
   track demo »The Hellfire Demos« was released. Even more astoundingly,
   with only these two songs under their belts the British death metal
   squad catapulted themselves into the spotlight of the international
   metal scene. The machine rolled ever forward and their first live show
   appearances were swiftly confirmed. In the meantime, MEMORIAM signed a
   deal with Nuclear Blast Records. Their first major milestone was the
   release of their debut album »For The Fallen« which has more than
   substantiated the deeper meaning of the band. The four musicians
   succeeded in doing something which most of their peers have not
   achieved in their entire careers - they've immortalised themselves
   within the history books of heavy metal.


   It's not surprising that MEMORIAM consists of veterans of the scene who
   have achieved the status of legends, at least in death metal circles.
   With frontman Karl Willets (ex-BOLT THROWER), Frank Healy (Bass,
   BENEDICTION), guitarist Scott Fairfax (live guitarist, BENEDICTION) and
   drummer Andrew Whale (ex-BOLT THROWER), the highest quality is
   guaranteed. This fact has been recognised by fans all over the world as
   well as by the press, who reverentially praised the debut. When British
   institution BOLT THROWER disbanded in early 2016, no-one dared dream
   that a super group or successor might be just around the corner, let
   alone that their consciousness might live on and inhabit a new form.
   The signature sound of these musicians lives on, and »For The
   Fallen« in its relentless style rolled down each and every
   preconception about the band's sound.


   For the musicians themselves, »For The Fallen« could be called an
   adjustment period in which they dealt with and aired their sadness and
   grievances due to their losses. As the year ticked on beyond the
   album’s release it became ever more apparent that the band was nowhere
   near taking a breather, and after several successful shows including
   Wacken Open Air, Graspop Open Air and Roadburn Festival they once again
   knuckled down to writing new material. This work has now been collected
   into eight merciless tracks in the form of a new work titled »The
   Silent Vigil«. MEMORIAM’s second album is less affected by sadness
   compared to its precursor, and their aggressiveness has increased
   manifold.

   The band has also worked intensively on the complexities of their
   sound, creating a monstrous tone that further enhances the imposing
   warfare. »The Silent Vigil« still sounds like MEMORIAM, but without
   once copying the debut. Fans need not worry; »The Silent Vigil« exudes
   their inimitable old school flair once again and has not abandoned
   their merciless groove for even one split second!
