       "Women in 3D Printing is leading the way in making a change for
       women in this sector; not only by encouraging more women to enter
       the industry but by helping to consolidate our position in this
       industry. I think with a common passion for 3D printing this group
       will be a force to reckoned with in the years to come. I am
       delighted to be a part of it and look forward to flying the flag
       here in Ireland!"

Monica Smith
       Application Development Consultant at EOS
       "One of the biggest ways we can encourage women to become involved
       with 3D Printing is by giving women role models in the industry,
       which WI3DP is doing a great job in tackling. I really appreciate
       the platform that WI3DP has created. I’m looking forward to
       starting the Munich chapter and bringing together women in our
       community!"

Christina Perla
       Co-Founder & CEO Makelab
       "As one of a few in an industry that's predominately male, the
       Wi3DP community has created a platform to and shined a light on all
       the hardworking women in this industry that I may not have
       otherwise known of and about. I'm excited to be a part of this and
       to spread the community in the NYC area."

Jennifer Shin
       Wi3DP Paris ambassador
       "Budding from a shared interest in 3D printing, the WI3DP community
       has grown into a safe space to share experiences, exchange tips,
       and be inspired in what is a predominately male industry. From
       industry experts to students studying this new tech and its even
       newer applications, to those just discovering 3D printing as a new
       found interest, WI3DP and its meetups provide a supportive and
       much-needed community for women around the world."

Marney Stapley
       Vice President North Forge Technology Exchange, VP Business
       Fabbaloo, Winnipeg Wi3DP ambassador
       "I typically am not one to single out women and I always seems to
       have been part of male-dominated industries and activities. Even in
       High School and University, I ran with the boys because they were
       the ones that I could keep up with. Today, I do see the benefits of
       our community having a diverse representation of ethnicity,
       backgrounds, and gender. Diversity is a key to market growth and
       driving innovation - especially during ideation sessions and
       solving complex problems. Diversity is key."

Tracy Hazzard
       Inc. Innovation Columnist and Host of WTFFF?! 3D Printing Podcast
       "As a woman in tech innovation, it can be very isolating without a
       shared experience. Women in 3D Printing has brought together
       amazing women from all backgrounds and experience levels, centering
       on one interest and passion – additive technology. It has helped me
       find new sources of inspiration and build a stronger diverse
       network. Wi3D is poised to become a catalyst for the industry. I
       highly recommend joining the group and taking advantage of all the
       information and events."

Sarah O'Sell
       Wi3DP Seattle ambassador
       "Women In 3D Printing is a diverse, welcoming, and highly
       supportive community of ladies seeking to explore possibilities and
       showcase the potential of a game-changing technology. With members
       of the art, fashion, architecture, design, food, robotics,
       manufacturing, and engineering fields, gatherings are a treat. I
       always look forward to reading the members showcase and have made a
       few new friends since joining!"

   Nora Toure

   Nora is a 3D Printing expert since 2010, particularly skilled at
   building strategic alliances and strong business relationships.
   Named among the 20 most influential women in Additive Manufacturing
   every year since 2015, Nora also received the Certificate of Honor in
   Manufacturing by the City of San Francisco in 2017 for her work with
   Women in 3D Printing, and was awarded Community Advocate of the year
   2018 by her peers.

   She started her career in Additive Manufacturing in 2010 by joining 3D
   Printing service leader, Sculpteo.

   Nora joined Ivaldi Group in 2018. Ivaldi Group leverages cutting-edge
   additive manufacturing solutions to provide on-site parts on demand
   services for various industries. Drawing on a breadth of additive
   manufacturing industry experience, Ivaldi Group works across a range of
   stakeholders to digitize product portfolios and improve cost, risk and
   delivery for all parties, providing a Part Replacement as a Service
   solution.
   As the VP of Strategy, Nora works closely with the CEO to build and
   implement the company's strategies in various segments: from core
   business value to customer relationship and parts production and
   delivery.

   Nora founded Women in 3D Printing in 2014 to promote women leaders in
   the Additive Manufacturing industry. She also co-initiated and
   co-organizes #3DTalk, an industry-specific and educational event series
   featuring women in the 3D Printing and related industries. #3DTalks are
   global events hosted in various cities across the USA and Europe.

   Pursuing her vision for more social inclusion, she joined 3D Africa as
   Board Advisor. 3D Africa is a youth and women economic empowerment
   program developed by the Youth for Technology Foundation (YTF), a
   nonprofit organization with years of experience combining education,
   technology, and economic development to transform economically
   challenged populations into self-sustainable communities. 3D Africa is
   part of the YTF’s Clinton Global Initiative 2016 Commitment to Action.

       "As a (female) programmer, I would have to really prove that I
       truly knew what I was talking about"

   May 25, 2016Nora Toure4 Comments

   DSC_0220 Bailey Geyer is the FDM supervisor at Stratasys Direct
   Manufacturing, a division of Stratasys. She kindly agreed to share her
   vision of the 3D printing world and her experience as a women in a
   male-dominated industry.

   Bailey, could you let us know about your background and what brought
   you into 3D printing in the first place?

   I worked as a costumed character at a theme park for about 5 years and
   then decided that I needed a “real” job. There was an administrative
   position open at the company that my dad worked for (Solid Concepts),
   so I applied and was hired. I soon realized that admin was the furthest
   thing from what I enjoyed doing and I wanted to be the person making
   the parts. I applied for a programming position but was rejected. I was
   undeterred and worked harder to show that I’d be a good fit in the
   programming department. About a year later, another position opened up
   and I applied again. Fortunately, the supervisor gave me a chance
   (after I passed his math test). I became his right hand and eventually
   got promoted to FDM Supervisor, which is my current position. Math and
   science were strong subjects for me in school, so the technical nature
   of 3D printing fits right in my comfort zone.

   What was your first experience with 3D Printing?

   In the early days of Solid Concepts, my dad had to work a lot of nights
   and weekends. He used to bring my brothers and me in to watch the SLA
   machines draw. As an 8 year old, it was really fascinating watching the
   lasers!

   As mentioned above, you are the FDM Supervisor at Stratasys Direct
   Manufacturing. Could you explain furthermore what your role in the
   company is?

   My current role is to supervise all of the Programmers and Operators of
   the SL, Polyjet and FDM departments. I also schedule the orders that
   come in for said departments. We work closely with the Project
   Engineers and help them to choose the right process for their
   customer’s projects.

   Do you have any (fun or not) story about your job to share with us?

   At the end of a Sunday night shift, I was watching the last layer of a
   SL machine draw. Suddenly, the resin started to swish side to side. I
   was racking my brain trying to figure out what could be causing it. I
   had never seen it do that before so I wasn’t sure how to fix it. Then I
   looked up at the lights in the room and they were also swaying back and
   forth. I realized that we were having an earthquake!

   As a woman working in a manufacturing world, what was/ is your biggest
   challenge?

   I think that the biggest challenge is people not taking you seriously.
   No one batted an eye when I was an admin because it’s a stereotypical
   woman position, but as a programmer, I would have to really prove that
   I truly knew what I was talking about. At least 3 different men came
   and sat on my desk to try to get what they wanted. A complete lack of
   respect! I even had a misogynist coworker tell me that my place is at
   home, and insisted that I wasn’t being a good wife and mother. These
   are some extreme things that I have personally experienced, but I see a
   little of it with my female employees, too. There is a tendency for
   engineers to challenge my female employees more than my male employees,
   even if they give the same information. Now that I am a supervisor, it
   does not happen to me. I suppose my title is enough proof now, so I
   don’t need to validate myself to anyone anymore.

   What makes the 3D printing industry particularly interesting for you?

   I love that it’s instant gratification. You can upload a file this
   morning and we can have the part ready to ship to you this afternoon!

   What do you think of the 3D printing industry today? And how would you
   like to see it evolve?

   There are so many possibilities now. There are a lot more people
   involved. I am especially interested in bio-printing. As we continue
   making safety improvements through semi- and fully-autonomous vehicles,
   bettering the food that we consume, finding cures for diseases, people
   will not be dying as quickly. As a result, there aren’t as many organs
   out there for the taking, which makes 3D printed human organs very
   appealing.

   In your opinion, how could we encourage more women to become involved
   with 3D Printing?

   Something that my dad participated in was Take Your Daughter to Work
   Day (which is now Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day). It really
   helped me to see that women were all over the company and not just in
   the clerical positions. The women that I work with come from diverse
   backgrounds and we couldn’t be more different from each other. Whether
   you’re a creator or just like helping people to actualize their vision,
   then 3D printing would be great for you.

   Bailey, it was so nice to read your post. Many years ago I was in
       Engineering and loved my job. The pressure go to me to stay home
       and raise my children. I did so for many years and now I am a
       single mom. I have such a strong desire to re-enter the engineering
       world but this time within the Additive Manufacturing world.
       Stratasys is the company I have been watching for some years now
       and would love to have a position with. I have returned to college
       and will graduate this month. Being a women I am finding it hard to
       find a job in the Engineering field again. I would be grateful if
       you would be willing to e-mail me or network with me. I am
       including my contact info below.
