   The Cases Home Sweet Fixer DIY Home Projects Big and Small Hi there!

   We are The Little Case Family: Kyle (My Partner in Grime), Luke (Our
   little man), Lila (Our baby girl) & Jessie (Up top – that’s me!) We are
   an Air Force family of full-time home DIY’ers. Our family lives in
   rough around the edge houses while we remodel, beautify & turn them
   into someone else’s happily ever after homes. Right now we live in the
   beautiful state of Washington!

   Follow along to see all of our fun & crazy do-it-yourself projects from
   start to finish. When we are not laying tile or painting walls, we are
   busy playing at the park, exploring new places or watching Netflix.

   Thanks for stopping by! We would love to see your projects as well, so
   feel free to leave comments here or hop on over to any of our social
   sites to connect!
