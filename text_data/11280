"Trollin" In to a New School Year!!

   I don't know about you, but my kids love trolls!  So, I thought how
   cute it would be to make a troll craft for the beginning of school!
   This can be used when teaching colors or just back to school.
   Here's a few ideas:
   Create a graph of your student's favorite color.  Pre-cut strips in
   several colors.  Let students choose a strip according to their
   favorite color and glue to the graph.  This is a sample graph.  Use a
   larger piece of chart paper for a larger group of students.  I mean,
   how adorable is that?

   We love to wear hats in my classroom.  Let students make troll hair for
   their favorite color.  :)
   [IMG_1790.jpg] [IMG_1791.jpg]
   So cute, right?
   [IMG_1770.jpg]
    To make the hair stand up glue a strip to the top of the hair.
   [IMG_1773.jpg]
    For the girl, I used a twist tie to gather the hair and, of course, I
   added a cute bow!
   [IMG_1774.jpg]
    Here's a sample chart for recording things that kids are excited about
   school.
   [IMG_1792.jpg]
    Everything in this post is included in the pack!  All patterns and
   words for charts and graphs.

Let this summer be a YES summer!

   [IMG_1342.JPG]
   First, let me say that this has nothing to do with kindergarten or
   education, but everything to do with being a mommy.
   I reflect a lot.  Like, I reflect on everything I do, everything I say,
   everything I may do, or may say, or could do, or could say.
   Upon reflecting, I feel like I'm always telling my kids "no".  Let me
   explain.  Should my kids be told no?  Absolutely!  I'm not talking
   about things that are concerning to their health or safety.  I'm
   talking about things that matter a lot to a child, but maybe not so
   much to an adult.  For example:
     * Kids: Can I have sprinkles on my pancakes?  Me: No, pancakes don't
       need any added sugar.
     * Kids: Can we have game night tonight?  Me: Um, I don't know...I'll
       probably be doing laundry.
     * Kids: Will you play ball with me?  Me: But, it's sooooooo hot
       outside.

   I know there are million and one blog posts and articles out there like
   this.  But, I don't want to be the mom that looks back and says, "Man,
   they grew up right before me and, I said no.  I didn't let them be
   little.  I didn't play ball with them or let them eat sprinkles on
   their pancakes for crying out loud."  I mean, who cares.
   Life can change in an instant.  I want my kids to have memories of me
   saying yes.
     * Yes, you can have a friend to sleep over.
     * Yes, you can stay up a few more minutes.
     * Yes, go ahead and drink that Mountain Dew.
     * Yes, keep playing.  A little rain won't hurt.
     * Yes, I'll hold you.

   I know every family is different and that's great.  Find things that
   fit your family's lifestyle and say yes.  Even if you don't have kids,
   say yes to your husband or wife, or grandkids, or nieces and nephews.
   Say yes to things that will impact a life, things that will make a
   memory, things that matter.
   I know I'm trying hard to think before the word no just spills out of
   my mouth.  Sure, I'll have moments...we all do right?  But, I'm writing
   this so I can reflect on what will make memories for my kids.  Trying
   not to sweat the small stuff.
   Use the good china.  Order dessert.  Spend your last dollars at the
   movies.
   Live life.  Say yes.

The NICE & NAUGHTY list!!

   You know,  every year when December hits, it's like the rules go out
   the window...sound familiar?  So, I came up with this little activity
   to help my little sweeties remember how to be peacemakers and make good
   choices in the midst of a little chaos.
   Here's how the lesson went down:
   First, I made the big Santa and had the lists and headers ready to go.
   I store the santa and use it each year. :)
   Next, I read each card aloud and I let my students tell me where each
   card fit.   Then, I taped them to the correct list.
   Last, I let my students write about something that would keep them on
   the NICE list!
   You can find the cards and headers in THIS packet HERE!

November Centers and Activities!!

   November brings a busy time of year!  I've blogged about the following
   ideas before.  There are lots of center activities and Thanksgiving
   Ideas that you could add into your classroom!
   November Craze
   I have this print and go pack that is perfect for those busy days!
   These activities will definitely keep your kiddos engaged in practicing
   important skills!  Look at all that FUN!
   [november%2Bcraze%2Bpreview.jpg]
   Don't forget about your writing station!
   There is a variety of writing that will fit all of your student's
   needs.  From list making, to labeling, to making books...it's all here!
   [november%2Bwriting%2Bpreview.jpg]
   Here's one thing that my students love to do!  I put the pieces and the
   cards in my writing center for them to work on.
   [nov%2Bwriting%2Bturkey.jpg]
   This is probably my FAVORITE turkey that we make every year.  I don't
   have a picture of ours, so this is from her class.  It's from Cara at
   The First Grade Parade!  Her ideas are always a must!
   You can grab this freebie HERE.

   Thanksgiving Centers
   Ordering numbers to 12...
   [IMG_2973.JPG]
    I love my centers that integrate math and literacy…boom!
   [IMG_2974.JPG]
    Sorting word family words...
   [IMG_2975.jpg]
    Building sight words with letter feathers…FUN!
   [IMG_2976.jpg]
    I put this on Instagram, but in case you aren't an Instagrammer…this
   is one of the funnest centers for math…they are so engaged every time
   we do it….
   [IMG_2977.JPG]
   Set the timer and hit go…stuff your turkey as fast as you can…
   Students count and record how much "stuffing" they put in their turkey
   for Thanksgiving Day
   [IMG_1132.JPG]
   [IMG_2983.JPG]
   For this game, I made up 10 headbands with feathers that had pictures
   on the feathers.  I randomly pass them out each day to 10 friends…the
   students in the group completing the activity walk around the room
   searching for the feathers that their friends are wearing on their
   head.  Then, they write the beginning sound.  Now, how fun is that…the
   whole class is involved!
   [IMG_2982.JPG]
   [IMG_2978.JPG]
   [IMG_2979.jpg]
   Beginning Sound Spin & Write
   [IMG_2984.JPG]
   Beginning and Ending Sounds…this was a little tricky for my kids right
   now, but I definitely could hear them trying...
   [IMG_2985.JPG]
   This is great for common core…each child gets a mini tub of red and
   yellow counters…Then, they complete their Gobble, Gobble Counting Book
   making combinations of different numbers on each page.  This is
   in Turkey Time Math Centers.
   [IMG_2986.JPG]
   [IMG_2987.JPG]
   [IMG_2988.JPG]
   These centers you can find in my Happy Thanksgiving Pack at my tpt
   store.
   [IMG_4194.JPG]
   [IMG_4196.JPG]
   They loved this one!  I added colored dots to match the feathers to
   make it easier for my kids to build the words.
   [IMG_4197.JPG]
   [IMG_4200.jpg]
   If you bought my unit, make sure you download the revised one...there's
   a "goof" on this one...do you see it?
   I fixed it and revised it!
   You can find the Native American Craft at the link below.
   Native American Writing and Craft Activity
   [IMG_4201.jpg]
   I always love how these turn out each year!  We've been talking about
   symmetry so we designed these cool shirts for our Native American
   friends.
   [IMG_4203.jpg]
   [IMG_4205.JPG]
   This center was a HIT!  They caught the turkey with a fishing pole and
   then bingo dotted the matching letter.
   Teacher Tip:  Instead of paper clips which always get pulled off from
   the fishing pole, just simply staple the corner of the game piece and
   it works perfect!  Easy peasy, lemon squeeze!
   You can find this in my TPT Store for FREE!
   Turkey Time Math
   Turkey Time Literacy
   Happy Thanksgiving Unit
   Hopefully you found some ideas you can use in your own classroom!
   Happy Thanksgiving!
