   Fact

   Along with $7 million, Johns Hopkins gave his Clifton estate to the
   trustees, intending that the university would eventually be located
   there, but the property was sold to the City of Baltimore in the 1880s.
   Clifton mansion still stands, and the grounds where the university
   would have been are now a public golf course.

   What is Mechanical Engineering?

   Our students and faculty operate on the cutting edge between science
   and engineering, exploring innovative applications such as robotics and
   human-machine interactions, micro- and nano-scale engineered devices
   and materials, energy and the environment, aerospace and machine
   systems, and biology and medicine.
   Why Hopkins?

   Our graduates emerge from the mechanical engineering program prepared
   to face today’s rapidly and ever-changing technological environment.
   Students work one-on-one professors who are intellectual leaders in
   their fields, giving them opportunities to engage in research in areas
   ranging from nano-scale engineering to bio-inspired robotics to
   computational engineering and space systems. Students concentrating on
   aerospace engineering are connected with industry internships. Senior
   year, student teams work in small teams to tackle specific design
   challenges presented by government, industry, and non-profits.

   Part-Time Programs

   Engineering for Professional's Mechanical Engineering part-time
   graduate program for practicing engineers broadens and strengthens
   students' understandings of traditional mechanical engineering
   fundamentals, and also introduces them to cutting edge applications and
   technologies. Courses are offered in three basic concentrations:
   mechanics, manufacturing, and controls.

   The civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome continue to delight and
   engage us with their history, literature, art, philosophy, and
   perennial relevance. Students of the Classics ground their enthusiasm
   for the ancient world in the study of the languages, thought, and
   physical remains of these amazing societies.

   The Department of Classics offers a rigorous yet flexible BA program,
   while also accommodating a variety of interests in and approaches to
   the ancient world. Classes are small and students work closely with
   their professors and instructors.

   The department offers courses in ancient Greek and Latin language and
   literature at all levels, as well as a variety of courses on the
   history, civilization, religion, art, archaeology, philosophy, and
   mythology of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Students are also
   encouraged to spend a semester or summer overseas in Italy or Greece.
