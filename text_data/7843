Kim M.D. Cuddington

   Associate Professor

   Kim M.D. Cuddington. Professor Kim Cuddington carries out research in
   theoretical and population ecology. Her mathematical models have been
   used to predict how and when species become invasive as well as
   describe the role species play as ecosystem engineers.

   Her research on the population dynamics of carp, a potentially
   devastating invasive fish poised to enter the Great Lakes, has grabbed
   international media attention. Her work also includes studies on the
   Emerald Ash Borer and the aquatic plant Spartina alterniflora, which
   alters tidal inundation in coastal regions where it grows.

Research

Ecosystem engineers

   Many important ecological relationships are non-trophic. For example,
   beavers build dams that determine the hydrology, species composition,
   and productivity of entire regions. However, almost all ecological
   theory regarding species interactions and population regulation ignores
   relations that occur via an abiotic medium. She is engaged in
   developing and parameterizing models of “ecosystem engineers” in an
   effort to establish the importance of this pervasive phenomena.

Invasive species

   The prediction of which species will become invasive, and which will
   which will go extinct is hampered by the failure to recognize the
   importance the variation of environmental conditions and ecosystem
   engineering. Positive autocorrelation in factors such as temperature
   might lead to “runs” of good or bad conditions that determine
   establishment probabilities and spread rates. Moreover, some species
   may modify environmental conditions such that their success in
   increased. For example, the aquatic plant Spartina alterniflora alters
   current flow, sedimentation rates, and ultimately the tidal inudation
   height of those coastal regions where it occurs. She develops
   predictive tools of these phenemona and test them using laboratory
   populations, and field data.

Biological control

   Spatial structure in the environment, like the branching morphology of
   plants, may alter movement, predation, reproductive rates and
   ultimately, the dynamics, of predator-prey populations. The fundamental
   mechanism which causes these alterations appears to be the anomalously
   slow rates of displacement of randomly moving individuals in spatially
   complex environments. She's testing whether this "diffusion-limitation"
   mechanism occurs in a well-controlled, yet realistic experimental
   system with biological control implications (peas-aphids-insect
   predators). The work suggests that Prof. Cuddington and her group can
   design plants that optimise the ability of beneficial predators to
   control pests.

Philosophy of ecology

   Professor Cuddington is interested in the role of metaphor and
   mathematics in shaping ideas about ecology. She also explores how
   theories change in the discipline, and what parsimony might mean in the
   context of ecological theory.
