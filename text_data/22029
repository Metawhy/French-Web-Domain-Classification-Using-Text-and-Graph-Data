The company timeline

   If you like stories about companies that started off in an attic or a
   garage, then this one is for you: Jacques, actual CEO of VSO, has been
   developing software since he was a student. At first it was just a
   hobby for him and he only developed freeware to make other user’s life
   easier. Then he met Fabrice, who was working in the same company back
   in 2003, and they decided to have a go at trying to make a living out
   of this “hobby”: Jacques on the developing side, and Fabrice on the
   business side. VSO Software was founded (why they called it VSO remains
   a secret!) and months later Blindwrite, the very first product, became
   an incontestable reference worldwide in the gaming industry. The rest,
   as they say, is history:
