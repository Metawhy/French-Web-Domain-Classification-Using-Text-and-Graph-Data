Image Gently Mission Statement Update

   The mission of the Image Gently Alliance is, through advocacy, to
   improve safe and effective imaging care of children worldwide.

Campaign Overview

   The Image Gently Campaigns and other efforts of the Image Gently
   Alliance rely on the generous donation of resources from the four
   founding organizations (Society for Pediatric Radiology, American
   College of Radiology, American Society for Radiologic Technologists,
   and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine), as well as all
   Alliance Organizations, and other supporters. The leadership of the
   Image Gently Alliance also gratefully acknowledges the value of
   industry partnerships: the sharing of time, talent and expertise
   committed to excellence in imaging of children, a foundation of the
   mission of the Alliance. These partnerships have afforded meetings and
   other Alliance activities, such as through an initial unrestricted
   educational grant from GE Healthcare made in 2007 at the inception of
   the Alliance.


   The Image Gently Alliance acknowledges all previous contributions with
   gratitude, but does not accept commercial financial donations at this
   time. However, we look forward to continued partnership in sharing
   insights and vision towards the safe imaging of children everywhere.

8/13/2019: Radiation dose to the paediatric undergoing diagnostic coronary
angiography and percutaneous intervention procedures

   Abstract
   Objectives
   This study sought to determine whether a radiation safety time-out
   reduces radiation exposure in electrophysiology procedures.
   Background
   Time-outs are integral to improving quality and safety. The authors
   hypothesized that a radiation safety time-out would reduce radiation
   exposure levels for patients and the health care team members.
   Methods
   The study was performed at the New York University Langone Health
   Electrophysiology Lab. Baseline data were collected for 6 months prior
   to the time-out. On implementation of the time-out, data were collected
   prospectively with analyses to be performed every 3 months. The primary
   endpoint was dose area product. The secondary endpoints included
   reference point dose, fluoroscopy time, use of additional shielding,
   and use of alternative imaging such as intracardiac and intravascular
   ultrasound. Read more...

8/5/2019: Radiation dose to the paediatric undergoing diagnostic coronary
angiography and percutaneous intervention procedures

   Highlights
   •Pediatric radiation dose is a critical issue and should be optimized.

   •Radiation dose benchmark guideline should be available to achieve
   ALARA.

   •Monitoring of radiation dose and awareness improvement among
   healthcare workers.

   Abstract
   Successful diagnostic and clinical outcomes in use of interventional
   cardiac imaging procedures make them strong choices in dealing with
   cardiovascular disease. Interventional procedures in developing
   countries are now growing markedly, increasing with the availability of
   equipment and trained staff. Present study in Sudan has examined
   pediatric radiation doses during Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DCA)
   and Percutaneous Intervention Procedures (PCI), identifying
   relationships leading to high values, in particular with patient
   characteristics and exposure parameters. Retrospective data analysis
   from DCA cases (n = 9) and PCI (n = 48) examined patient-based
   characteristics, exposure parameters and the Kerma Area Product (KAP).
   For DCA and PCI, the mean KAP and fluoroscopic time were Read more...

7/25/19: Simple preoperative radiation safety interventions significantly
lower radiation doses during central venous line placement in children

   Abstract
   Purpose
   The purpose of this study was to reduce radiation exposure during
   pediatric central venous line (CVL) placement by implementing a
   radiation safety process including a radiation safety briefing and a
   job-instruction model with a preradiation time-out.

7/3/19: Update: Image Gently and Nuclear Medicine at 10 Years

   Nuclear medicine offers well-established and valuable clinical
   diagnostic instrumentation and techniques in several disciplines,
   including urology, neurology, orthopedics, and oncology (1). Although
   radiation exposure from nuclear medicine studies is on par with (and
   often lower than) that of other medical imaging procedures, it is still
   prudent to limit the amount of radiation exposure to the lowest amount
   possible without reducing its diagnostic capability. This is
   particularly relevant in children because  Read more

6/28/19: Radiation exposure during paediatric emergency CT: Time we took
notice?

   Abstract
   Introduction
   Concerns exist about radiation exposure during medical imaging.
   Comprehensive computerised tomography (CT) dose standards exist for
   adults, but are incomplete for children. We investigated paediatric CT
   radiation doses at a NHS Trust in order to define the extent of the
   risk.

   Methods
   CT dose indicators (CTDI) were recorded for all scans on paediatric
   patients from January – December 2011 and benchmarked against Read more

6/4/2019 Optimizing Communication With Parents on Benefits and Radiation
Risks in Pediatric Imaging

   From JACR
   Nima Kasraie, PhD; David Jordan, PhD; Christopher Keup, MD; Sjirk
   Westra, MD

   Abstract
   Effective radiation risk communication is a core competency for
   radiology care providers and can prevent and resolve potential
   conflicts while helping achieve effective public health safeguards. The
   authors present a synopsis of the challenges to holding such dialogue
   and review published methods for strengthening and maintaining this
   discourse. Twelve strategies are discussed in this article that can
   help alleviate concerns about the iatrogenic risk associated with
   medical imaging using radiation exposure.

   Key Words
   Risk communicationperceptioncancerpediatric imagingiatrogenicparents

   Introduction
   Despite improvements in protocol optimization and scanner technology to
   reduce exposure to children, there remains public concern about
   iatrogenic effects of radiation exposure. If patients or their parents
   are fearful of radiation exposure and have concerns reinforced by
   inaccurate information, there is risk for compromised patient care as
   access or image quality is diminished through efforts to reduce
   radiation dose 1, 2, 3, 4. Worse, patients may Read more
