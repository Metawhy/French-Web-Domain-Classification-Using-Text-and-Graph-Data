     * Russell Lee - Writer Russell Lee - Writer
       Russell Lee | Writer
       Guru's services have allowed me to find more freelancing work as a
       writer than any other website. It is easy to communicate with
       clients through their message system and their SafePay feature
       ensures that all funds are secured prior to any work being done. I
       would recommend Guru to any freelancer who is looking to find new
       clients online.
     * Solace Engineers Inc. - Engineering Firm Russell Lee - Writer
       Solace Engineers Inc. | Engineering Firm
       At SOLACE Engineers, we provide engineering solutions and other
       services on various freelancing platforms. Among them all, Guru is
       the best and our first choice to invite clients outside of
       freelancing platforms. Great customer support, low fee, easy to
       understand interface and solid payment protection with the SafePay
       system make working a delight on Guru! Guru really helped our
       business flourish…
     * Isabel Austin - Writer, Editor, Proofreader Isabel Austin - Writer,
       Editor, Proofreader
       Isabel Austin | Writer, Editor, Proofreader
       Guru.com is my favorite freelance platform. I love the
       functionality, the support and the strong workflow element,
       particularly the SafePay feature which makes the transfer of funds
       so easy. I love the integration with PayPal and the ability to
       amend agreements, with all steps communicated to and actioned by
       both sides. Of all the freelance platforms I have used, Guru is by
       far my favorite.
     * Ella Rogue - Singer, Songwriter Ella Rogue - Singer, Songwriter
       Ella Rogue | Singer, Songwriter
       Guru has been so helpful in growing my business in an industry that
       is tough to get into! Not only can I apply for endless amounts of
       gigs that I feel I am a match for...but potential clients can
       invite me to apply for gigs which has brought me a lot of success.
       I love how it connects people from all over the world and gives us
       an opportunity to work together on just about any project
       imaginable. I am excited to continue growing my business here!
     * Scopic Software - Custom IT Solutions Firm Scopic Software - Custom
       IT Solutions Firm
       Scopic Software | Custom IT Solutions Firm
       Scopic Software has been on Guru since its founding in 2006. We are
       now over 200 employees and Guru is still our primary source of new
       clients. We would not be where we are today without Guru. It is
       definitely the best service marketplace out there if you are
       looking to grow a company, either as a buyer or provider.
       Guru is not only a marketplace but a place to do business. We meet
       new clients and more often than not establish long-term business
       relationships, all through Guru. The flexibility in how projects
       can be structured and the many payment options available allows us
       to work with clients in a way they feel most comfortable. We have
       been with Guru for over 10 years and hope to be here much longer.
     * Kat Jennings Kat Jennings
       Kat Jennings | CEO, TaxConnections
       As the CEO of www.taxconnections.com, I looked all over the world
       for someone I could trust to handle our servers and databases. Nix
       Solutions Ltd. has delivered support for all our servers in the
       cloud for several years now and they are amazing. As I talked to
       other service providers who wanted to charge me 10X more I was
       stunned and pleasantly surprised to discover Nix Solutions Ltd at
       their low prices. They have continuously provided outstanding
       service 24/7 which I am forever grateful. These guys do it all and
       I would advise any CEO that Nix Solutions Ltd. will exceed their
       expectations. Also, I should add we discovered Nix Solutions Ltd.
       only through Guru.com which makes me very happy with your
       organization, too. Thank you for facilitating the connection.
     * Ed Bagley Ed Bagley
       Ed Bagley | Director of Product Marketing, O.C. Tanner Company
       In our company, we do ongoing research with our target audience.
       This includes 30-45 minute phone interviews. It was difficult to
       conduct the interview, really listen, and ask good follow up
       questions while trying to capture it all in thorough hand-written
       notes. One of our writers suggested using Guru to find someone to
       transcribe these interviews...The person I hired is the one I’ve
       stuck with for nearly two years now – she is fast, accurate, and
       affordable. I’d never have found her on my own, given that I live
       in Utah and she lives in South Africa. I could never have arranged
       such an effective solution to my on-going need for transcripts
       without Guru. It’s been a life-saver.
