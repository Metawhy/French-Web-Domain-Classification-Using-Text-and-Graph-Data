       from inmates' family and friends and markets to them, unlike anyone
       else.

       MOST avenues for your county to earn money. Commissary, Video
       Visitation, Phone Integration, Inmate E-Mail and SMS, PictureMail
       plus improved employee efficiency all impact your bottom line
       revenue, productivity and morale.
    5. Performance: Our system works. We monitor our kiosks all day, every
       day and have strict guidelines set in place to maximize our
       performance. Ask about our 99.9% up-time!
