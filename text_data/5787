Harvard NLP

   Harvard NLP studies machine learning methods for processing and
   generating human language. We are interested in mathematical models of
   sequence generation, challenges of artificial intelligence grounded in
   human language, and the exploration of linguistic structure with
   statistical tools.

   Our group's research publications and open-source projects have focused
   on text summarization, neural machine translation, visualizing
   recurrent neural networks, algorithms for shrinking neural networks,
   models for entity tracking in documents, multi-modal text generation,
   grammatical error correction, and new approaches for text generation.
