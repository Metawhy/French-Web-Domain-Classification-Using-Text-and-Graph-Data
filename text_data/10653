Definitions

   Access Control
          The restriction of access to network realms. In an Apache
          context usually the restriction of access to certain URLs.
          See: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control

   Algorithm
          An unambiguous formula or set of rules for solving a problem in
          a finite number of steps. Algorithms for encryption are usually
          called Ciphers.

   APache eXtension Tool (apxs)
          A perl script that aids in compiling module sources into Dynamic
          Shared Objects (DSOs) and helps install them in the Apache Web
          server.
          See: Manual Page: apxs

   Apache Portable Runtime (APR)
          A set of libraries providing many of the basic interfaces
          between the server and the operating system. APR is developed
          parallel to the Apache HTTP Server as an independent project.
          See: Apache Portable Runtime Project

   Authentication
          The positive identification of a network entity such as a
          server, a client, or a user.
          See: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control

   Certificate
          A data record used for authenticating network entities such as a
          server or a client. A certificate contains X.509 information
          pieces about its owner (called the subject) and the signing
          Certification Authority (called the issuer), plus the owner's
          public key and the signature made by the CA. Network entities
          verify these signatures using CA certificates.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
          An unsigned certificate for submission to a Certification
          Authority, which signs it with the Private Key of their CA
          Certificate. Once the CSR is signed, it becomes a real
          certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Certification Authority (CA)
          A trusted third party whose purpose is to sign certificates for
          network entities it has authenticated using secure means. Other
          network entities can check the signature to verify that a CA has
          authenticated the bearer of a certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Cipher
          An algorithm or system for data encryption. Examples are DES,
          IDEA, RC4, etc.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Ciphertext
          The result after Plaintext is passed through a Cipher.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
          A standard definition for an interface between a web server and
          an external program that allows the external program to service
          requests. There is an Informational RFC which covers the
          specifics.
          See: Dynamic Content with CGI

   Configuration Directive
          See: Directive

   Configuration File
          A text file containing Directives that control the configuration
          of Apache.
          See: Configuration Files

   CONNECT
          An HTTP method for proxying raw data channels over HTTP. It can
          be used to encapsulate other protocols, such as the SSL
          protocol.

   Context
          An area in the configuration files where certain types of
          directives are allowed.
          See: Terms Used to Describe Apache Directives

   Digital Signature
          An encrypted text block that validates a certificate or other
          file. A Certification Authority creates a signature by
          generating a hash of the Public Key embedded in a Certificate,
          then encrypting the hash with its own Private Key. Only the CA's
          public key can decrypt the signature, verifying that the CA has
          authenticated the network entity that owns the Certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Directive
          A configuration command that controls one or more aspects of
          Apache's behavior. Directives are placed in the Configuration
          File
          See: Directive Index

   Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)
          Modules compiled separately from the Apache httpd binary that
          can be loaded on-demand.
          See: Dynamic Shared Object Support

   Environment Variable (env-variable)
          Named variables managed by the operating system shell and used
          to store information and communicate between programs. Apache
          also contains internal variables that are referred to as
          environment variables, but are stored in internal Apache
          structures, rather than in the shell environment.
          See: Environment Variables in Apache

   Export-Crippled
          Diminished in cryptographic strength (and security) in order to
          comply with the United States' Export Administration Regulations
          (EAR). Export-crippled cryptographic software is limited to a
          small key size, resulting in Ciphertext which usually can be
          decrypted by brute force.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Filter
          A process that is applied to data that is sent or received by
          the server. Input filters process data sent by the client to the
          server, while output filters process documents on the server
          before they are sent to the client. For example, the INCLUDES
          output filter processes documents for Server Side Includes.
          See: Filters

   Fully-Qualified Domain-Name (FQDN)
          The unique name of a network entity, consisting of a hostname
          and a domain name that can resolve to an IP address. For
          example, www is a hostname, example.com is a domain name, and
          www.example.com is a fully-qualified domain name.

   Handler
          An internal Apache representation of the action to be performed
          when a file is called. Generally, files have implicit handlers,
          based on the file type. Normally, all files are simply served by
          the server, but certain file types are "handled" separately. For
          example, the cgi-script handler designates files to be processed
          as CGIs.
          See: Apache's Handler Use

   Hash
          A mathematical one-way, irreversible algorithm generating a
          string with fixed-length from another string of any length.
          Different input strings will usually produce different hashes
          (depending on the hash function).

   Header
          The part of the HTTP request and response that is sent before
          the actual content, and that contains meta-information
          describing the content.

   .htaccess
          A configuration file that is placed inside the web tree and
          applies configuration directives to the directory where it is
          placed and all sub-directories. Despite its name, this file can
          hold almost any type of directive, not just access-control
          directives.
          See: Configuration Files

   httpd.conf
          The main Apache configuration file. The default location is
          /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, but it may be moved using
          run-time or compile-time configuration.
          See: Configuration Files

   HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
          The standard transmission protocol used on the World Wide Web.
          Apache implements version 1.1 of the protocol, referred to as
          HTTP/1.1 and defined by RFC 2616.

   HTTPS
          The HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secure), the standard encrypted
          communication mechanism on the World Wide Web. This is actually
          just HTTP over SSL.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Method
          In the context of HTTP, an action to perform on a resource,
          specified on the request line by the client. Some of the methods
          available in HTTP are GET, POST, and PUT.

   Message Digest
          A hash of a message, which can be used to verify that the
          contents of the message have not been altered in transit.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   MIME-type
          A way to describe the kind of document being transmitted. Its
          name comes from that fact that its format is borrowed from the
          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It consists of a major
          type and a minor type, separated by a slash. Some examples are
          text/html, image/gif, and application/octet-stream. In HTTP, the
          MIME-type is transmitted in the Content-Type header.
          See: mod_mime

   Module
          An independent part of a program. Much of Apache's functionality
          is contained in modules that you can choose to include or
          exclude. Modules that are compiled into the Apache httpd binary
          are called static modules, while modules that are stored
          separately and can be optionally loaded at run-time are called
          dynamic modules or DSOs. Modules that are included by default
          are called base modules. Many modules are available for Apache
          that are not distributed as part of the Apache HTTP Server
          tarball. These are referred to as third-party modules.
          See: Module Index

   Module Magic Number (MMN)
          Module Magic Number is a constant defined in the Apache source
          code that is associated with binary compatibility of modules. It
          is changed when internal Apache structures, function calls and
          other significant parts of API change in such a way that binary
          compatibility cannot be guaranteed any more. On MMN change, all
          third party modules have to be at least recompiled, sometimes
          even slightly changed in order to work with the new version of
          Apache.

   OpenSSL
          The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
          See http://www.openssl.org/#

   Pass Phrase
          The word or phrase that protects private key files. It prevents
          unauthorized users from encrypting them. Usually it's just the
          secret encryption/decryption key used for Ciphers.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Plaintext
          The unencrypted text.

   Private Key
          The secret key in a Public Key Cryptography system, used to
          decrypt incoming messages and sign outgoing ones.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Proxy
          An intermediate server that sits between the client and the
          origin server. It accepts requests from clients, transmits those
          requests on to the origin server, and then returns the response
          from the origin server to the client. If several clients request
          the same content, the proxy can deliver that content from its
          cache, rather than requesting it from the origin server each
          time, thereby reducing response time.
          See: mod_proxy

   Public Key
          The publicly available key in a Public Key Cryptography system,
          used to encrypt messages bound for its owner and to decrypt
          signatures made by its owner.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Public Key Cryptography
          The study and application of asymmetric encryption systems,
          which use one key for encryption and another for decryption. A
          corresponding pair of such keys constitutes a key pair. Also
          called Asymmetric Cryptography.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Regular Expression (Regex)
          A way of describing a pattern in text - for example, "all the
          words that begin with the letter A" or "every 10-digit phone
          number" or even "Every sentence with two commas in it, and no
          capital letter Q". Regular expressions are useful in Apache
          because they let you apply certain attributes against
          collections of files or resources in very flexible ways - for
          example, all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory
          could be written as "/images/.*(jpg|gif)$". In places where
          regular expressions are used to replace strings, the special
          variables $1 ... $9 contain backreferences to the grouped parts
          (in parentheses) of the matched expression. The special variable
          $0 contains a backreference to the whole matched expression. To
          write a literal dollar sign in a replacement string, it can be
          escaped with a backslash. Historically, the variable & could be
          used as alias for $0 in some places. This is no longer possible
          since version 2.3.6. Apache uses Perl Compatible Regular
          Expressions provided by the PCRE library. You can find more
          documentation about PCRE's regular expression syntax at that
          site, or at Wikipedia.

   Reverse Proxy
          A proxy server that appears to the client as if it is an origin
          server. This is useful to hide the real origin server from the
          client for security reasons, or to load balance.

   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
          A protocol created by Netscape Communications Corporation for
          general communication authentication and encryption over TCP/IP
          networks. The most popular usage is HTTPS, i.e. the HyperText
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over SSL.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Server Name Indication (SNI)
          An SSL function that allows passing the desired server hostname
          in the initial SSL handshake message, so that the web server can
          select the correct virtual host configuration to use in
          processing the SSL handshake. It was added to SSL starting with
          the TLS extensions, RFC 3546.
          See: the SSL FAQ and RFC 3546

   Server Side Includes (SSI)
          A technique for embedding processing directives inside HTML
          files.
          See: Introduction to Server Side Includes

   Session
          The context information of a communication in general.

   SSLeay
          The original SSL/TLS implementation library developed by Eric A.
          Young

   Subrequest
          Apache provides a subrequest API to modules that allows other
          filesystem or URL paths to be partially or fully evaluated by
          the server. Example consumers of this API are DirectoryIndex,
          mod_autoindex, and mod_include.

   Symmetric Cryptography
          The study and application of Ciphers that use a single secret
          key for both encryption and decryption operations.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Tarball
          A package of files gathered together using the tar utility.
          Apache distributions are stored in compressed tar archives or
          using pkzip.

   Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          The successor protocol to SSL, created by the Internet
          Engineering Task Force (IETF) for general communication
          authentication and encryption over TCP/IP networks. TLS version
          1 is nearly identical with SSL version 3.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
          The name/address of a resource on the Internet. This is the
          common informal term for what is formally called a Uniform
          Resource Identifier. URLs are usually made up of a scheme, like
          http or https, a hostname, and a path. A URL for this page might
          be http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/glossary.html.

   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
          A compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or
          physical resource. It is formally defined by RFC 2396. URIs used
          on the world-wide web are commonly referred to as URLs.

   Virtual Hosting
          Serving multiple websites using a single instance of Apache. IP
          virtual hosting differentiates between websites based on their
          IP address, while name-based virtual hosting uses only the name
          of the host and can therefore host many sites on the same IP
          address.
          See: Apache Virtual Host documentation

   X.509
          An authentication certificate scheme recommended by the
          International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) which is used for
          SSL/TLS authentication.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

Core Enhancements

   Run-time Loadable MPMs
          Multiple MPMs can now be built as loadable modules at compile
          time. The MPM of choice can be configured at run time via
          LoadModule directive.

   Event MPM
          The Event MPM is no longer experimental but is now fully
          supported.

   Asynchronous support
          Better support for asynchronous read/write for supporting MPMs
          and platforms.

   Per-module and per-directory LogLevel configuration
          The LogLevel can now be configured per module and per directory.
          New levels trace1 to trace8 have been added above the debug log
          level.

   Per-request configuration sections
          <If>, <ElseIf>, and <Else> sections can be used to set the
          configuration based on per-request criteria.

   General-purpose expression parser
          A new expression parser allows to specify complex conditions
          using a common syntax in directives like SetEnvIfExpr,
          RewriteCond, Header, <If>, and others.

   KeepAliveTimeout in milliseconds
          It is now possible to specify KeepAliveTimeout in milliseconds.

   NameVirtualHost directive
          No longer needed and is now deprecated.

   Override Configuration
          The new AllowOverrideList directive allows more fine grained
          control which directives are allowed in .htaccess files.

   Config file variables
          It is now possible to Define variables in the configuration,
          allowing a clearer representation if the same value is used at
          many places in the configuration.

   Reduced memory usage
          Despite many new features, 2.4.x tends to use less memory than
          2.2.x.

Module Enhancements

   mod_ssl
          mod_ssl can now be configured to use an OCSP server to check the
          validation status of a client certificate. The default responder
          is configurable, along with the decision on whether to prefer
          the responder designated in the client certificate itself.
          mod_ssl now also supports OCSP stapling, where the server
          pro-actively obtains an OCSP verification of its certificate and
          transmits that to the client during the handshake.
          mod_ssl can now be configured to share SSL Session data between
          servers through memcached
          EC keys are now supported in addition to RSA and DSA.
          Support for TLS-SRP (available in 2.4.4 and later).

   mod_proxy
          The ProxyPass directive is now most optimally configured within
          a Location or LocationMatch block, and offers a significant
          performance advantage over the traditional two-parameter syntax
          when present in large numbers.
          The source address used for proxy requests is now configurable.
          Support for Unix domain sockets to the backend (available in
          2.4.7 and later).

   mod_proxy_balancer
          More runtime configuration changes for BalancerMembers via
          balancer-manager
          Additional BalancerMembers can be added at runtime via
          balancer-manager
          Runtime configuration of a subset of Balancer parameters
          BalancerMembers can be set to 'Drain' so that they only respond
          to existing sticky sessions, allowing them to be taken
          gracefully offline.
          Balancer settings can be persistent after restarts.

   mod_cache
          The mod_cache CACHE filter can be optionally inserted at a given
          point in the filter chain to provide fine control over caching.
          mod_cache can now cache HEAD requests.
          Where possible, mod_cache directives can now be set per
          directory, instead of per server.
          The base URL of cached URLs can be customised, so that a cluster
          of caches can share the same endpoint URL prefix.
          mod_cache is now capable of serving stale cached data when a
          backend is unavailable (error 5xx).
          mod_cache can now insert HIT/MISS/REVALIDATE into an X-Cache
          header.

   mod_include
          Support for the 'onerror' attribute within an 'include' element,
          allowing an error document to be served on error instead of the
          default error string.

   mod_cgi, mod_include, mod_isapi, ...
          Translation of headers to environment variables is more strict
          than before to mitigate some possible cross-site-scripting
          attacks via header injection. Headers containing invalid
          characters (including underscores) are now silently dropped.
          Environment Variables in Apache has some pointers on how to work
          around broken legacy clients which require such headers. (This
          affects all modules which use these environment variables.)

   mod_authz_core Authorization Logic Containers
          Advanced authorization logic may now be specified using the
          Require directive and the related container directives, such as
          <RequireAll>.

   mod_rewrite
          mod_rewrite adds the [QSD] (Query String Discard) and [END]
          flags for RewriteRule to simplify common rewriting scenarios.
          Adds the possibility to use complex boolean expressions in
          RewriteCond.
          Allows the use of SQL queries as RewriteMap functions.

   mod_ldap, mod_authnz_ldap
          mod_authnz_ldap adds support for nested groups.
          mod_ldap adds LDAPConnectionPoolTTL, LDAPTimeout, and other
          improvements in the handling of timeouts. This is especially
          useful for setups where a stateful firewall drops idle
          connections to the LDAP server.
          mod_ldap adds LDAPLibraryDebug to log debug information provided
          by the used LDAP toolkit.

   mod_info
          mod_info can now dump the pre-parsed configuration to stdout
          during server startup.

   mod_auth_basic
          New generic mechanism to fake basic authentication (available in
          2.4.5 and later).

Program Enhancements

   fcgistarter
          New FastCGI daemon starter utility

   htcacheclean
          Current cached URLs can now be listed, with optional metadata
          included.
          Allow explicit deletion of individual cached URLs from the
          cache.
          File sizes can now be rounded up to the given block size, making
          the size limits map more closely to the real size on disk.
          Cache size can now be limited by the number of inodes, instead
          of or in addition to being limited by the size of the files on
          disk.

   rotatelogs
          May now create a link to the current log file.
          May now invoke a custom post-rotate script.

   htpasswd, htdbm
          Support for the bcrypt algorithm (available in 2.4.4 and later).

Documentation

   mod_rewrite
          The mod_rewrite documentation has been rearranged and almost
          completely rewritten, with a focus on examples and common usage,
          as well as on showing you when other solutions are more
          appropriate. The Rewrite Guide is now a top-level section with
          much more detail and better organization.

   mod_ssl
          The mod_ssl documentation has been greatly enhanced, with more
          examples at the getting started level, in addition to the
          previous focus on technical details.

   Caching Guide
          The Caching Guide has been rewritten to properly distinguish
          between the RFC2616 HTTP/1.1 caching features provided by
          mod_cache, and the generic key/value caching provided by the
          socache interface, as well as to cover specialised caching
          provided by mechanisms such as mod_file_cache.

Module Developer Changes

   Check Configuration Hook Added
          A new hook, check_config, has been added which runs between the
          pre_config and open_logs hooks. It also runs before the
          test_config hook when the -t option is passed to httpd. The
          check_config hook allows modules to review interdependent
          configuration directive values and adjust them while messages
          can still be logged to the console. The user can thus be alerted
          to misconfiguration problems before the core open_logs hook
          function redirects console output to the error log.

   Expression Parser Added
          We now have a general-purpose expression parser, whose API is
          exposed in ap_expr.h. This is adapted from the expression parser
          previously implemented in mod_ssl.

   Authorization Logic Containers
          Authorization modules now register as a provider, via
          ap_register_auth_provider(), to support advanced authorization
          logic, such as <RequireAll>.

   Small-Object Caching Interface
          The ap_socache.h header exposes a provider-based interface for
          caching small data objects, based on the previous implementation
          of the mod_ssl session cache. Providers using a shared-memory
          cyclic buffer, disk-based dbm files, and a memcache distributed
          cache are currently supported.

   Cache Status Hook Added
          The mod_cache module now includes a new cache_status hook, which
          is called when the caching decision becomes known. A default
          implementation is provided which adds an optional X-Cache and
          X-Cache-Detail header to the response.

   The developer documentation contains a detailed list of API changes.

Core Enhancements

   Authn/Authz
          The bundled authentication and authorization modules have been
          refactored. The new mod_authn_alias(already removed from
          2.3/2.4) module can greatly simplify certain authentication
          configurations. See module name changes, and the developer
          changes for more information about how these changes affects
          users and module writers.

   Caching
          mod_cache, mod_cache_disk, and mod_mem_cache(already removed
          from 2.3/2.4) have undergone a lot of changes, and are now
          considered production-quality. htcacheclean has been introduced
          to clean up mod_cache_disk setups.

   Configuration
          The default configuration layout has been simplified and
          modularised. Configuration snippets which can be used to enable
          commonly-used features are now bundled with Apache, and can be
          easily added to the main server config.

   Graceful stop
          The prefork, worker and event MPMs now allow httpd to be
          shutdown gracefully via the graceful-stop signal. The
          GracefulShutdownTimeout directive has been added to specify an
          optional timeout, after which httpd will terminate regardless of
          the status of any requests being served.

   Proxying
          The new mod_proxy_balancer module provides load balancing
          services for mod_proxy. The new mod_proxy_ajp module adds
          support for the Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3 used by Apache
          Tomcat.

   Regular Expression Library Updated
          Version 5.0 of the Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library
          (PCRE) is now included. httpd can be configured to use a system
          installation of PCRE by passing the --with-pcre flag to
          configure.

   Smart Filtering
          mod_filter introduces dynamic configuration to the output filter
          chain. It enables filters to be conditionally inserted, based on
          any Request or Response header or environment variable, and
          dispenses with the more problematic dependencies and ordering
          problems in the 2.0 architecture.

   Large File Support
          httpd is now built with support for files larger than 2GB on
          modern 32-bit Unix systems. Support for handling >2GB request
          bodies has also been added.

   Event MPM
          The event MPM uses a separate thread to handle Keep Alive
          requests and accepting connections. Keep Alive requests have
          traditionally required httpd to dedicate a worker to handle it.
          This dedicated worker could not be used again until the Keep
          Alive timeout was reached.

   SQL Database Support
          mod_dbd, together with the apr_dbd framework, brings direct SQL
          support to modules that need it. Supports connection pooling in
          threaded MPMs.

Module Enhancements

   Authn/Authz
          Modules in the aaa directory have been renamed and offer better
          support for digest authentication. For example, mod_auth is now
          split into mod_auth_basic and mod_authn_file; mod_auth_dbm is
          now called mod_authn_dbm; mod_access has been renamed
          mod_authz_host. There is also a new mod_authn_alias(already
          removed from 2.3/2.4) module for simplifying certain
          authentication configurations.

   mod_authnz_ldap
          This module is a port of the 2.0 mod_auth_ldap module to the 2.2
          Authn/Authz framework. New features include using LDAP attribute
          values and complicated search filters in the Require directive.

   mod_authz_owner
          A new module that authorizes access to files based on the owner
          of the file on the file system

   mod_version
          A new module that allows configuration blocks to be enabled
          based on the version number of the running server.

   mod_info
          Added a new ?config argument which will show the configuration
          directives as parsed by Apache, including their file name and
          line number. The module also shows the order of all request
          hooks and additional build information, similar to httpd -V.

   mod_ssl
          Added a support for RFC 2817, which allows connections to
          upgrade from clear text to TLS encryption.

   mod_imagemap
          mod_imap has been renamed to mod_imagemap to avoid user
          confusion.

   top

Program Enhancements

   httpd
          A new command line option -M has been added that lists all
          modules that are loaded based on the current configuration.
          Unlike the -l option, this list includes DSOs loaded via mod_so.

   httxt2dbm
          A new program used to generate dbm files from text input, for
          use in RewriteMap with the dbm map type.

   top

Module Developer Changes

   APR 1.0 API
          Apache 2.2 uses the APR 1.0 API. All deprecated functions and
          symbols have been removed from APR and APR-Util. For details,
          see the APR Website.

   Authn/Authz
          The bundled authentication and authorization modules have been
          renamed along the following lines:

          + mod_auth_* -> Modules that implement an HTTP authentication
            mechanism
          + mod_authn_* -> Modules that provide a backend authentication
            provider
          + mod_authz_* -> Modules that implement authorization (or
            access)
          + mod_authnz_* -> Module that implements both authentication &
            authorization

          There is a new authentication backend provider scheme which
          greatly eases the construction of new authentication backends.

   Connection Error Logging
          A new function, ap_log_cerror has been added to log errors that
          occur with the client's connection. When logged, the message
          includes the client IP address.

   Test Configuration Hook Added
          A new hook, test_config has been added to aid modules that want
          to execute special code only when the user passes -t to httpd.

   Set Threaded MPM's Stacksize
          A new directive, ThreadStackSize has been added to set the stack
          size on all threaded MPMs. This is required for some third-party
          modules on platforms with small default thread stack size.

   Protocol handling for output filters
          In the past, every filter has been responsible for ensuring that
          it generates the correct response headers where it affects them.
          Filters can now delegate common protocol management to
          mod_filter, using the ap_register_output_filter_protocol or
          ap_filter_protocol calls.

   Monitor hook added
          Monitor hook enables modules to run regular/scheduled jobs in
          the parent (root) process.

   Regular expression API changes
          The pcreposix.h header is no longer available; it is replaced by
          the new ap_regex.h header. The POSIX.2 regex.h implementation
          exposed by the old header is now available under the ap_
          namespace from ap_regex.h. Calls to regcomp, regexec and so on
          can be replaced by calls to ap_regcomp, ap_regexec.

   DBD Framework (SQL Database API)
          With Apache 1.x and 2.0, modules requiring an SQL backend had to
          take responsibility for managing it themselves. Apart from
          reinventing the wheel, this can be very inefficient, for example
          when several modules each maintain their own connections.

          Apache 2.1 and later provides the ap_dbd API for managing
          database connections (including optimised strategies for
          threaded and unthreaded MPMs), while APR 1.2 and later provides
          the apr_dbd API for interacting with the database.

          New modules SHOULD now use these APIs for all SQL database
          operations. Existing applications SHOULD be upgraded to use it
          where feasible, either transparently or as a recommended option
          to their users.

   This glossary defines some of the common terminology related to Apache
   in particular, and web serving in general. More information on each
   concept is provided in the links.
   top

Definitions

   Access Control
          The restriction of access to network realms. In an Apache
          context usually the restriction of access to certain URLs.
          See: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control

   Algorithm
          An unambiguous formula or set of rules for solving a problem in
          a finite number of steps. Algorithms for encryption are usually
          called Ciphers.

   APache eXtension Tool (apxs)
          A perl script that aids in compiling module sources into Dynamic
          Shared Objects (DSOs) and helps install them in the Apache Web
          server.
          See: Manual Page: apxs

   Apache Portable Runtime (APR)
          A set of libraries providing many of the basic interfaces
          between the server and the operating system. APR is developed
          parallel to the Apache HTTP Server as an independent project.
          See: Apache Portable Runtime Project

   Authentication
          The positive identification of a network entity such as a
          server, a client, or a user.
          See: Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control

   Certificate
          A data record used for authenticating network entities such as a
          server or a client. A certificate contains X.509 information
          pieces about its owner (called the subject) and the signing
          Certification Authority (called the issuer), plus the owner's
          public key and the signature made by the CA. Network entities
          verify these signatures using CA certificates.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
          An unsigned certificate for submission to a Certification
          Authority, which signs it with the Private Key of their CA
          Certificate. Once the CSR is signed, it becomes a real
          certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Certification Authority (CA)
          A trusted third party whose purpose is to sign certificates for
          network entities it has authenticated using secure means. Other
          network entities can check the signature to verify that a CA has
          authenticated the bearer of a certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Cipher
          An algorithm or system for data encryption. Examples are DES,
          IDEA, RC4, etc.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Ciphertext
          The result after Plaintext is passed through a Cipher.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
          A standard definition for an interface between a web server and
          an external program that allows the external program to service
          requests. There is an Informational RFC which covers the
          specifics.
          See: Dynamic Content with CGI

   Configuration Directive
          See: Directive

   Configuration File
          A text file containing Directives that control the configuration
          of Apache.
          See: Configuration Files

   CONNECT
          An HTTP method for proxying raw data channels over HTTP. It can
          be used to encapsulate other protocols, such as the SSL
          protocol.

   Context
          An area in the configuration files where certain types of
          directives are allowed.
          See: Terms Used to Describe Apache Directives

   Digital Signature
          An encrypted text block that validates a certificate or other
          file. A Certification Authority creates a signature by
          generating a hash of the Public Key embedded in a Certificate,
          then encrypting the hash with its own Private Key. Only the CA's
          public key can decrypt the signature, verifying that the CA has
          authenticated the network entity that owns the Certificate.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Directive
          A configuration command that controls one or more aspects of
          Apache's behavior. Directives are placed in the Configuration
          File
          See: Directive Index

   Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)
          Modules compiled separately from the Apache httpd binary that
          can be loaded on-demand.
          See: Dynamic Shared Object Support

   Environment Variable (env-variable)
          Named variables managed by the operating system shell and used
          to store information and communicate between programs. Apache
          also contains internal variables that are referred to as
          environment variables, but are stored in internal Apache
          structures, rather than in the shell environment.
          See: Environment Variables in Apache

   Export-Crippled
          Diminished in cryptographic strength (and security) in order to
          comply with the United States' Export Administration Regulations
          (EAR). Export-crippled cryptographic software is limited to a
          small key size, resulting in Ciphertext which usually can be
          decrypted by brute force.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Filter
          A process that is applied to data that is sent or received by
          the server. Input filters process data sent by the client to the
          server, while output filters process documents on the server
          before they are sent to the client. For example, the INCLUDES
          output filter processes documents for Server Side Includes.
          See: Filters

   Fully-Qualified Domain-Name (FQDN)
          The unique name of a network entity, consisting of a hostname
          and a domain name that can resolve to an IP address. For
          example, www is a hostname, example.com is a domain name, and
          www.example.com is a fully-qualified domain name.

   Handler
          An internal Apache representation of the action to be performed
          when a file is called. Generally, files have implicit handlers,
          based on the file type. Normally, all files are simply served by
          the server, but certain file types are "handled" separately. For
          example, the cgi-script handler designates files to be processed
          as CGIs.
          See: Apache's Handler Use

   Hash
          A mathematical one-way, irreversible algorithm generating a
          string with fixed-length from another string of any length.
          Different input strings will usually produce different hashes
          (depending on the hash function).

   Header
          The part of the HTTP request and response that is sent before
          the actual content, and that contains meta-information
          describing the content.

   .htaccess
          A configuration file that is placed inside the web tree and
          applies configuration directives to the directory where it is
          placed and all sub-directories. Despite its name, this file can
          hold almost any type of directive, not just access-control
          directives.
          See: Configuration Files

   httpd.conf
          The main Apache configuration file. The default location is
          /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, but it may be moved using
          run-time or compile-time configuration.
          See: Configuration Files

   HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
          The standard transmission protocol used on the World Wide Web.
          Apache implements version 1.1 of the protocol, referred to as
          HTTP/1.1 and defined by RFC 2616.

   HTTPS
          The HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secure), the standard encrypted
          communication mechanism on the World Wide Web. This is actually
          just HTTP over SSL.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Method
          In the context of HTTP, an action to perform on a resource,
          specified on the request line by the client. Some of the methods
          available in HTTP are GET, POST, and PUT.

   Message Digest
          A hash of a message, which can be used to verify that the
          contents of the message have not been altered in transit.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   MIME-type
          A way to describe the kind of document being transmitted. Its
          name comes from that fact that its format is borrowed from the
          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It consists of a major
          type and a minor type, separated by a slash. Some examples are
          text/html, image/gif, and application/octet-stream. In HTTP, the
          MIME-type is transmitted in the Content-Type header.
          See: mod_mime

   Module
          An independent part of a program. Much of Apache's functionality
          is contained in modules that you can choose to include or
          exclude. Modules that are compiled into the Apache httpd binary
          are called static modules, while modules that are stored
          separately and can be optionally loaded at run-time are called
          dynamic modules or DSOs. Modules that are included by default
          are called base modules. Many modules are available for Apache
          that are not distributed as part of the Apache HTTP Server
          tarball. These are referred to as third-party modules.
          See: Module Index

   Module Magic Number (MMN)
          Module Magic Number is a constant defined in the Apache source
          code that is associated with binary compatibility of modules. It
          is changed when internal Apache structures, function calls and
          other significant parts of API change in such a way that binary
          compatibility cannot be guaranteed any more. On MMN change, all
          third party modules have to be at least recompiled, sometimes
          even slightly changed in order to work with the new version of
          Apache.

   OpenSSL
          The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
          See http://www.openssl.org/#

   Pass Phrase
          The word or phrase that protects private key files. It prevents
          unauthorized users from encrypting them. Usually it's just the
          secret encryption/decryption key used for Ciphers.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Plaintext
          The unencrypted text.

   Private Key
          The secret key in a Public Key Cryptography system, used to
          decrypt incoming messages and sign outgoing ones.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Proxy
          An intermediate server that sits between the client and the
          origin server. It accepts requests from clients, transmits those
          requests on to the origin server, and then returns the response
          from the origin server to the client. If several clients request
          the same content, the proxy can deliver that content from its
          cache, rather than requesting it from the origin server each
          time, thereby reducing response time.
          See: mod_proxy

   Public Key
          The publicly available key in a Public Key Cryptography system,
          used to encrypt messages bound for its owner and to decrypt
          signatures made by its owner.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Public Key Cryptography
          The study and application of asymmetric encryption systems,
          which use one key for encryption and another for decryption. A
          corresponding pair of such keys constitutes a key pair. Also
          called Asymmetric Cryptography.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Regular Expression (Regex)
          A way of describing a pattern in text - for example, "all the
          words that begin with the letter A" or "every 10-digit phone
          number" or even "Every sentence with two commas in it, and no
          capital letter Q". Regular expressions are useful in Apache
          because they let you apply certain attributes against
          collections of files or resources in very flexible ways - for
          example, all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory
          could be written as "/images/.*(jpg|gif)$". In places where
          regular expressions are used to replace strings, the special
          variables $1 ... $9 contain backreferences to the grouped parts
          (in parentheses) of the matched expression. The special variable
          $0 contains a backreference to the whole matched expression. To
          write a literal dollar sign in a replacement string, it can be
          escaped with a backslash. Historically, the variable & could be
          used as alias for $0 in some places. This is no longer possible
          since version 2.3.6. Apache uses Perl Compatible Regular
          Expressions provided by the PCRE library. You can find more
          documentation about PCRE's regular expression syntax at that
          site, or at Wikipedia.

   Reverse Proxy
          A proxy server that appears to the client as if it is an origin
          server. This is useful to hide the real origin server from the
          client for security reasons, or to load balance.

   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
          A protocol created by Netscape Communications Corporation for
          general communication authentication and encryption over TCP/IP
          networks. The most popular usage is HTTPS, i.e. the HyperText
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over SSL.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Server Name Indication (SNI)
          An SSL function that allows passing the desired server hostname
          in the initial SSL handshake message, so that the web server can
          select the correct virtual host configuration to use in
          processing the SSL handshake. It was added to SSL starting with
          the TLS extensions, RFC 3546.
          See: the SSL FAQ and RFC 3546

   Server Side Includes (SSI)
          A technique for embedding processing directives inside HTML
          files.
          See: Introduction to Server Side Includes

   Session
          The context information of a communication in general.

   SSLeay
          The original SSL/TLS implementation library developed by Eric A.
          Young

   Subrequest
          Apache provides a subrequest API to modules that allows other
          filesystem or URL paths to be partially or fully evaluated by
          the server. Example consumers of this API are DirectoryIndex,
          mod_autoindex, and mod_include.

   Symmetric Cryptography
          The study and application of Ciphers that use a single secret
          key for both encryption and decryption operations.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Tarball
          A package of files gathered together using the tar utility.
          Apache distributions are stored in compressed tar archives or
          using pkzip.

   Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          The successor protocol to SSL, created by the Internet
          Engineering Task Force (IETF) for general communication
          authentication and encryption over TCP/IP networks. TLS version
          1 is nearly identical with SSL version 3.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

   Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
          The name/address of a resource on the Internet. This is the
          common informal term for what is formally called a Uniform
          Resource Identifier. URLs are usually made up of a scheme, like
          http or https, a hostname, and a path. A URL for this page might
          be http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/glossary.html.

   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
          A compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or
          physical resource. It is formally defined by RFC 2396. URIs used
          on the world-wide web are commonly referred to as URLs.

   Virtual Hosting
          Serving multiple websites using a single instance of Apache. IP
          virtual hosting differentiates between websites based on their
          IP address, while name-based virtual hosting uses only the name
          of the host and can therefore host many sites on the same IP
          address.
          See: Apache Virtual Host documentation

   X.509
          An authentication certificate scheme recommended by the
          International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) which is used for
          SSL/TLS authentication.
          See: SSL/TLS Encryption

Core Enhancements

   Run-time Loadable MPMs
          Multiple MPMs can now be built as loadable modules at compile
          time. The MPM of choice can be configured at run time via
          LoadModule directive.

   Event MPM
          The Event MPM is no longer experimental but is now fully
          supported.

   Asynchronous support
          Better support for asynchronous read/write for supporting MPMs
          and platforms.

   Per-module and per-directory LogLevel configuration
          The LogLevel can now be configured per module and per directory.
          New levels trace1 to trace8 have been added above the debug log
          level.

   Per-request configuration sections
          <If>, <ElseIf>, and <Else> sections can be used to set the
          configuration based on per-request criteria.

   General-purpose expression parser
          A new expression parser allows to specify complex conditions
          using a common syntax in directives like SetEnvIfExpr,
          RewriteCond, Header, <If>, and others.

   KeepAliveTimeout in milliseconds
          It is now possible to specify KeepAliveTimeout in milliseconds.

   NameVirtualHost directive
          No longer needed and is now deprecated.

   Override Configuration
          The new AllowOverrideList directive allows more fine grained
          control which directives are allowed in .htaccess files.

   Config file variables
          It is now possible to Define variables in the configuration,
          allowing a clearer representation if the same value is used at
          many places in the configuration.

   Reduced memory usage
          Despite many new features, 2.4.x tends to use less memory than
          2.2.x.

Module Enhancements

   mod_ssl
          mod_ssl can now be configured to use an OCSP server to check the
          validation status of a client certificate. The default responder
          is configurable, along with the decision on whether to prefer
          the responder designated in the client certificate itself.
          mod_ssl now also supports OCSP stapling, where the server
          pro-actively obtains an OCSP verification of its certificate and
          transmits that to the client during the handshake.
          mod_ssl can now be configured to share SSL Session data between
          servers through memcached
          EC keys are now supported in addition to RSA and DSA.
          Support for TLS-SRP (available in 2.4.4 and later).

   mod_proxy
          The ProxyPass directive is now most optimally configured within
          a Location or LocationMatch block, and offers a significant
          performance advantage over the traditional two-parameter syntax
          when present in large numbers.
          The source address used for proxy requests is now configurable.
          Support for Unix domain sockets to the backend (available in
          2.4.7 and later).

   mod_proxy_balancer
          More runtime configuration changes for BalancerMembers via
          balancer-manager
          Additional BalancerMembers can be added at runtime via
          balancer-manager
          Runtime configuration of a subset of Balancer parameters
          BalancerMembers can be set to 'Drain' so that they only respond
          to existing sticky sessions, allowing them to be taken
          gracefully offline.
          Balancer settings can be persistent after restarts.

   mod_cache
          The mod_cache CACHE filter can be optionally inserted at a given
          point in the filter chain to provide fine control over caching.
          mod_cache can now cache HEAD requests.
          Where possible, mod_cache directives can now be set per
          directory, instead of per server.
          The base URL of cached URLs can be customised, so that a cluster
          of caches can share the same endpoint URL prefix.
          mod_cache is now capable of serving stale cached data when a
          backend is unavailable (error 5xx).
          mod_cache can now insert HIT/MISS/REVALIDATE into an X-Cache
          header.

   mod_include
          Support for the 'onerror' attribute within an 'include' element,
          allowing an error document to be served on error instead of the
          default error string.

   mod_cgi, mod_include, mod_isapi, ...
          Translation of headers to environment variables is more strict
          than before to mitigate some possible cross-site-scripting
          attacks via header injection. Headers containing invalid
          characters (including underscores) are now silently dropped.
          Environment Variables in Apache has some pointers on how to work
          around broken legacy clients which require such headers. (This
          affects all modules which use these environment variables.)

   mod_authz_core Authorization Logic Containers
          Advanced authorization logic may now be specified using the
          Require directive and the related container directives, such as
          <RequireAll>.

   mod_rewrite
          mod_rewrite adds the [QSD] (Query String Discard) and [END]
          flags for RewriteRule to simplify common rewriting scenarios.
          Adds the possibility to use complex boolean expressions in
          RewriteCond.
          Allows the use of SQL queries as RewriteMap functions.

   mod_ldap, mod_authnz_ldap
          mod_authnz_ldap adds support for nested groups.
          mod_ldap adds LDAPConnectionPoolTTL, LDAPTimeout, and other
          improvements in the handling of timeouts. This is especially
          useful for setups where a stateful firewall drops idle
          connections to the LDAP server.
          mod_ldap adds LDAPLibraryDebug to log debug information provided
          by the used LDAP toolkit.

   mod_info
          mod_info can now dump the pre-parsed configuration to stdout
          during server startup.

   mod_auth_basic
          New generic mechanism to fake basic authentication (available in
          2.4.5 and later).

Program Enhancements

   fcgistarter
          New FastCGI daemon starter utility

   htcacheclean
          Current cached URLs can now be listed, with optional metadata
          included.
          Allow explicit deletion of individual cached URLs from the
          cache.
          File sizes can now be rounded up to the given block size, making
          the size limits map more closely to the real size on disk.
          Cache size can now be limited by the number of inodes, instead
          of or in addition to being limited by the size of the files on
          disk.

   rotatelogs
          May now create a link to the current log file.
          May now invoke a custom post-rotate script.

   htpasswd, htdbm
          Support for the bcrypt algorithm (available in 2.4.4 and later).

Documentation

   mod_rewrite
          The mod_rewrite documentation has been rearranged and almost
          completely rewritten, with a focus on examples and common usage,
          as well as on showing you when other solutions are more
          appropriate. The Rewrite Guide is now a top-level section with
          much more detail and better organization.

   mod_ssl
          The mod_ssl documentation has been greatly enhanced, with more
          examples at the getting started level, in addition to the
          previous focus on technical details.

   Caching Guide
          The Caching Guide has been rewritten to properly distinguish
          between the RFC2616 HTTP/1.1 caching features provided by
          mod_cache, and the generic key/value caching provided by the
          socache interface, as well as to cover specialised caching
          provided by mechanisms such as mod_file_cache.

Module Developer Changes

   Check Configuration Hook Added
          A new hook, check_config, has been added which runs between the
          pre_config and open_logs hooks. It also runs before the
          test_config hook when the -t option is passed to httpd. The
          check_config hook allows modules to review interdependent
          configuration directive values and adjust them while messages
          can still be logged to the console. The user can thus be alerted
          to misconfiguration problems before the core open_logs hook
          function redirects console output to the error log.

   Expression Parser Added
          We now have a general-purpose expression parser, whose API is
          exposed in ap_expr.h. This is adapted from the expression parser
          previously implemented in mod_ssl.

   Authorization Logic Containers
          Authorization modules now register as a provider, via
          ap_register_auth_provider(), to support advanced authorization
          logic, such as <RequireAll>.

   Small-Object Caching Interface
          The ap_socache.h header exposes a provider-based interface for
          caching small data objects, based on the previous implementation
          of the mod_ssl session cache. Providers using a shared-memory
          cyclic buffer, disk-based dbm files, and a memcache distributed
          cache are currently supported.

   Cache Status Hook Added
          The mod_cache module now includes a new cache_status hook, which
          is called when the caching decision becomes known. A default
          implementation is provided which adds an optional X-Cache and
          X-Cache-Detail header to the response.

   The developer documentation contains a detailed list of API changes.

Core Enhancements

   Authn/Authz
          The bundled authentication and authorization modules have been
          refactored. The new mod_authn_alias(already removed from
          2.3/2.4) module can greatly simplify certain authentication
          configurations. See module name changes, and the developer
          changes for more information about how these changes affects
          users and module writers.

   Caching
          mod_cache, mod_cache_disk, and mod_mem_cache(already removed
          from 2.3/2.4) have undergone a lot of changes, and are now
          considered production-quality. htcacheclean has been introduced
          to clean up mod_cache_disk setups.

   Configuration
          The default configuration layout has been simplified and
          modularised. Configuration snippets which can be used to enable
          commonly-used features are now bundled with Apache, and can be
          easily added to the main server config.

   Graceful stop
          The prefork, worker and event MPMs now allow httpd to be
          shutdown gracefully via the graceful-stop signal. The
          GracefulShutdownTimeout directive has been added to specify an
          optional timeout, after which httpd will terminate regardless of
          the status of any requests being served.

   Proxying
          The new mod_proxy_balancer module provides load balancing
          services for mod_proxy. The new mod_proxy_ajp module adds
          support for the Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3 used by Apache
          Tomcat.

   Regular Expression Library Updated
          Version 5.0 of the Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library
          (PCRE) is now included. httpd can be configured to use a system
          installation of PCRE by passing the --with-pcre flag to
          configure.

   Smart Filtering
          mod_filter introduces dynamic configuration to the output filter
          chain. It enables filters to be conditionally inserted, based on
          any Request or Response header or environment variable, and
          dispenses with the more problematic dependencies and ordering
          problems in the 2.0 architecture.

   Large File Support
          httpd is now built with support for files larger than 2GB on
          modern 32-bit Unix systems. Support for handling >2GB request
          bodies has also been added.

   Event MPM
          The event MPM uses a separate thread to handle Keep Alive
          requests and accepting connections. Keep Alive requests have
          traditionally required httpd to dedicate a worker to handle it.
          This dedicated worker could not be used again until the Keep
          Alive timeout was reached.

   SQL Database Support
          mod_dbd, together with the apr_dbd framework, brings direct SQL
          support to modules that need it. Supports connection pooling in
          threaded MPMs.

   Authn/Authz
          Modules in the aaa directory have been renamed and offer better
          support for digest authentication. For example, mod_auth is now
          split into mod_auth_basic and mod_authn_file; mod_auth_dbm is
          now called mod_authn_dbm; mod_access has been renamed
          mod_authz_host. There is also a new mod_authn_alias(already
          removed from 2.3/2.4) module for simplifying certain
          authentication configurations.

   mod_authnz_ldap
          This module is a port of the 2.0 mod_auth_ldap module to the 2.2
          Authn/Authz framework. New features include using LDAP attribute
          values and complicated search filters in the Require directive.

   mod_authz_owner
          A new module that authorizes access to files based on the owner
          of the file on the file system

   mod_version
          A new module that allows configuration blocks to be enabled
          based on the version number of the running server.

   mod_info
          Added a new ?config argument which will show the configuration
          directives as parsed by Apache, including their file name and
          line number. The module also shows the order of all request
          hooks and additional build information, similar to httpd -V.

   mod_ssl
          Added a support for RFC 2817, which allows connections to
          upgrade from clear text to TLS encryption.

   mod_imagemap
          mod_imap has been renamed to mod_imagemap to avoid user
          confusion.

Program Enhancements

   httpd
          A new command line option -M has been added that lists all
          modules that are loaded based on the current configuration.
          Unlike the -l option, this list includes DSOs loaded via mod_so.

   httxt2dbm
          A new program used to generate dbm files from text input, for
          use in RewriteMap with the dbm map type.

   top

Module Developer Changes

   APR 1.0 API
          Apache 2.2 uses the APR 1.0 API. All deprecated functions and
          symbols have been removed from APR and APR-Util. For details,
          see the APR Website.

   Authn/Authz
          The bundled authentication and authorization modules have been
          renamed along the following lines:

          + mod_auth_* -> Modules that implement an HTTP authentication
            mechanism
          + mod_authn_* -> Modules that provide a backend authentication
            provider
          + mod_authz_* -> Modules that implement authorization (or
            access)
          + mod_authnz_* -> Module that implements both authentication &
            authorization

          There is a new authentication backend provider scheme which
          greatly eases the construction of new authentication backends.

   Connection Error Logging
          A new function, ap_log_cerror has been added to log errors that
          occur with the client's connection. When logged, the message
          includes the client IP address.

   Test Configuration Hook Added
          A new hook, test_config has been added to aid modules that want
          to execute special code only when the user passes -t to httpd.

   Set Threaded MPM's Stacksize
          A new directive, ThreadStackSize has been added to set the stack
          size on all threaded MPMs. This is required for some third-party
          modules on platforms with small default thread stack size.

   Protocol handling for output filters
          In the past, every filter has been responsible for ensuring that
          it generates the correct response headers where it affects them.
          Filters can now delegate common protocol management to
          mod_filter, using the ap_register_output_filter_protocol or
          ap_filter_protocol calls.

   Monitor hook added
          Monitor hook enables modules to run regular/scheduled jobs in
          the parent (root) process.

   Regular expression API changes
          The pcreposix.h header is no longer available; it is replaced by
          the new ap_regex.h header. The POSIX.2 regex.h implementation
          exposed by the old header is now available under the ap_
          namespace from ap_regex.h. Calls to regcomp, regexec and so on
          can be replaced by calls to ap_regcomp, ap_regexec.

   DBD Framework (SQL Database API)
          With Apache 1.x and 2.0, modules requiring an SQL backend had to
          take responsibility for managing it themselves. Apart from
          reinventing the wheel, this can be very inefficient, for example
          when several modules each maintain their own connections.

          Apache 2.1 and later provides the ap_dbd API for managing
          database connections (including optimised strategies for
          threaded and unthreaded MPMs), while APR 1.2 and later provides
          the apr_dbd API for interacting with the database.

          New modules SHOULD now use these APIs for all SQL database
          operations. Existing applications SHOULD be upgraded to use it
          where feasible, either transparently or as a recommended option
          to their users.

Core Enhancements

   Unix Threading
          On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache httpd can now
          run in a hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This improves
          scalability for many, but not all configurations.

   New Build System
          The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be based on
          autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache httpd's configuration
          system more similar to that of other packages.

   Multiprotocol Support
          Apache HTTP Server now has some of the infrastructure in place
          to support serving multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written
          as an example.

   Better support for non-Unix platforms
          Apache HTTP Server 2.0 is faster and more stable on non-Unix
          platforms such as BeOS, OS/2, and Windows. With the introduction
          of platform-specific multi-processing modules (MPMs) and the
          Apache Portable Runtime (APR), these platforms are now
          implemented in their native API, avoiding the often buggy and
          poorly performing POSIX-emulation layers.

   New Apache httpd API
          The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0. Many of
          the module-ordering/-priority problems from 1.3 should be gone.
          2.0 does much of this automatically, and module ordering is now
          done per-hook to allow more flexibility. Also, new calls have
          been added that provide additional module capabilities without
          patching the core Apache HTTP Server.

   IPv6 Support
          On systems where IPv6 is supported by the underlying Apache
          Portable Runtime library, Apache httpd gets IPv6 listening
          sockets by default. Additionally, the Listen, NameVirtualHost,
          and VirtualHost directives support IPv6 numeric address strings
          (e.g., "Listen [2001:db8::1]:8080").

   Filtering
          Apache httpd modules may now be written as filters which act on
          the stream of content as it is delivered to or from the server.
          This allows, for example, the output of CGI scripts to be parsed
          for Server Side Include directives using the INCLUDES filter in
          mod_include. The module mod_ext_filter allows external programs
          to act as filters in much the same way that CGI programs can act
          as handlers.

   Multilanguage Error Responses
          Error response messages to the browser are now provided in
          several languages, using SSI documents. They may be customized
          by the administrator to achieve a consistent look and feel.

   Simplified configuration
          Many confusing directives have been simplified. The often
          confusing Port and BindAddress directives are gone; only the
          Listen directive is used for IP address binding; the ServerName
          directive specifies the server name and port number only for
          redirection and vhost recognition.

   Native Windows NT Unicode Support
          Apache httpd 2.0 on Windows NT now uses utf-8 for all filename
          encodings. These directly translate to the underlying Unicode
          file system, providing multilanguage support for all Windows
          NT-based installations, including Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
          This support does not extend to Windows 95, 98 or ME, which
          continue to use the machine's local codepage for filesystem
          access.

   Regular Expression Library Updated
          Apache httpd 2.0 includes the Perl Compatible Regular Expression
          Library (PCRE). All regular expression evaluation now uses the
          more powerful Perl 5 syntax.

Module Enhancements

   mod_ssl
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0. This module is an interface to
          the SSL/TLS encryption protocols provided by OpenSSL.

   mod_dav
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0. This module implements the HTTP
          Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) specification for
          posting and maintaining web content.

   mod_deflate
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0. This module allows supporting
          browsers to request that content be compressed before delivery,
          saving network bandwidth.

   mod_auth_ldap
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0.41. This module allows an LDAP
          database to be used to store credentials for HTTP Basic
          Authentication. A companion module, mod_ldap provides connection
          pooling and results caching.

   mod_auth_digest
          Includes additional support for session caching across processes
          using shared memory.

   mod_charset_lite
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0. This experimental module allows
          for character set translation or recoding.

   mod_file_cache
          New module in Apache httpd 2.0. This module includes the
          functionality of mod_mmap_static in Apache HTTP Server version
          1.3, plus adds further caching abilities.

   mod_headers
          This module is much more flexible in Apache httpd 2.0. It can
          now modify request headers used by mod_proxy, and it can
          conditionally set response headers.

   mod_proxy
          The proxy module has been completely rewritten to take advantage
          of the new filter infrastructure and to implement a more
          reliable, HTTP/1.1 compliant proxy. In addition, new <Proxy>
          configuration sections provide more readable (and internally
          faster) control of proxied sites; overloaded <Directory
          "proxy:..."> configuration are not supported. The module is now
          divided into specific protocol support modules including
          proxy_connect, proxy_ftp and proxy_http.

   mod_negotiation
          A new ForceLanguagePriority directive can be used to assure that
          the client receives a single document in all cases, rather than
          NOT ACCEPTABLE or MULTIPLE CHOICES responses. In addition, the
          negotiation and MultiViews algorithms have been cleaned up to
          provide more consistent results and a new form of type map that
          can include document content is provided.

   mod_autoindex
          Autoindex'ed directory listings can now be configured to use
          HTML tables for cleaner formatting, and allow finer-grained
          control of sorting, including version-sorting, and wildcard
          filtering of the directory listing.

   mod_include
          New directives allow the default start and end tags for SSI
          elements to be changed and allow for error and time format
          configuration to take place in the main configuration file
          rather than in the SSI document. Results from regular expression
          parsing and grouping (now based on Perl's regular expression
          syntax) can be retrieved using mod_include's variables $0 .. $9.

   mod_auth_dbm
          Now supports multiple types of DBM-like databases using the
          AuthDBMType directive.

   Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4

   <-

   Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4

Upgrading to 2.4 from 2.2

   Available Languages:  en  |  fr

   In order to assist folks upgrading, we maintain a document describing
   information critical to existing Apache HTTP Server users. These are
   intended to be brief notes, and you should be able to find more
   information in either the New Features document, or in the src/CHANGES
   file. Application and module developers can find a summary of API
   changes in the API updates overview.

   This document describes changes in server behavior that might require
   you to change your configuration or how you use the server in order to
   continue using 2.4 as you are currently using 2.2. To take advantage of
   new features in 2.4, see the New Features document.

   This document describes only the changes from 2.2 to 2.4. If you are
   upgrading from version 2.0, you should also consult the 2.0 to 2.2
   upgrading document.

Compile-Time Configuration Changes

   The compilation process is very similar to the one used in version 2.2.
   Your old configure command line (as found in build/config.nice in the
   installed server directory) can be used in most cases. There are some
   changes in the default settings. Some details of changes:
     * These modules have been removed: mod_authn_default,
       mod_authz_default, mod_mem_cache. If you were using mod_mem_cache
       in 2.2, look at mod_cache_disk in 2.4.
     * All load balancing implementations have been moved to individual,
       self-contained mod_proxy submodules, e.g. mod_lbmethod_bybusyness.
       You might need to build and load any of these that your
       configuration uses.
     * Platform support has been removed for BeOS, TPF, and even older
       platforms such as A/UX, Next, and Tandem. These were believed to be
       broken anyway.
     * configure: dynamic modules (DSO) are built by default
     * configure: By default, only a basic set of modules is loaded. The
       other LoadModule directives are commented out in the configuration
       file.
     * configure: the "most" module set gets built by default
     * configure: the "reallyall" module set adds developer modules to the
       "all" set

   top

Run-Time Configuration Changes

   There have been significant changes in authorization configuration, and
   other minor configuration changes, that could require changes to your
   2.2 configuration files before using them for 2.4.

Authorization

   Any configuration file that uses authorization will likely need
   changes.

   You should review the Authentication, Authorization and Access Control
   Howto, especially the section Beyond just authorization which explains
   the new mechanisms for controlling the order in which the authorization
   directives are applied.

   Directives that control how authorization modules respond when they
   don't match the authenticated user have been removed: This includes
   AuthzLDAPAuthoritative, AuthzDBDAuthoritative, AuthzDBMAuthoritative,
   AuthzGroupFileAuthoritative, AuthzUserAuthoritative, and
   AuthzOwnerAuthoritative. These directives have been replaced by the
   more expressive RequireAny, RequireNone, and RequireAll.

   If you use mod_authz_dbm, you must port your configuration to use
   Require dbm-group ... in place of Require group ....

Access control

   In 2.2, access control based on client hostname, IP address, and other
   characteristics of client requests was done using the directives Order,
   Allow, Deny, and Satisfy.

   In 2.4, such access control is done in the same way as other
   authorization checks, using the new module mod_authz_host. The old
   access control idioms should be replaced by the new authentication
   mechanisms, although for compatibility with old configurations, the new
   module mod_access_compat is provided.

Mixing old and new directives

   Mixing old directives like Order, Allow or Deny with new ones like
   Require is technically possible but discouraged. mod_access_compat was
   created to support configurations containing only old directives to
   facilitate the 2.4 upgrade. Please check the examples below to get a
   better idea about issues that might arise.

   Here are some examples of old and new ways to do the same access
   control.

   In this example, there is no authentication and all requests are
   denied.

2.2 configuration:

Order deny,allow
Deny from all

2.4 configuration:

Require all denied

   In this example, there is no authentication and all requests are
   allowed.

2.2 configuration:

Order allow,deny
Allow from all

2.4 configuration:

Require all granted

   In the following example, there is no authentication and all hosts in
   the example.org domain are allowed access; all other hosts are denied
   access.

2.2 configuration:

Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from example.org

2.4 configuration:

Require host example.org

   In the following example, mixing old and new directives leads to
   unexpected results.

Mixing old and new directives: NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

<Directory "/">
    AllowOverride None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</Directory>

<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
    Require local
</Location>

access.log - GET /server-status 403 127.0.0.1
error.log - AH01797: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/html/server
-status

   Why httpd denies access to servers-status even if the configuration
   seems to allow it? Because mod_access_compat directives take precedence
   over the mod_authz_host one in this configuration merge scenario.

   This example conversely works as expected:

Mixing old and new directives: WORKING AS EXPECTED

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

<Directory "/">
    AllowOverride None
    Require all denied
</Directory>

<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow From 127.0.0.1
</Location>

access.log - GET /server-status 200 127.0.0.1

   So even if mixing configuration is still possible, please try to avoid
   it when upgrading: either keep old directives and then migrate to the
   new ones on a later stage or just migrate everything in bulk.

   In many configurations with authentication, where the value of the
   Satisfy was the default of ALL, snippets that simply disabled
   host-based access control are omitted:

2.2 configuration:

# 2.2 config that disables host-based access control and uses only authenticatio
n
Order Deny,Allow
Allow from all
AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
Require valid-user

2.4 configuration:

# No replacement of disabling host-based access control needed
AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
Require valid-user

   In configurations where both authentication and access control were
   meaningfully combined, the access control directives should be
   migrated. This example allows requests meeting both criteria:

2.2 configuration:

Order allow,deny
Deny from all
# Satisfy ALL is the default
Satisfy ALL
Allow from 127.0.0.1
AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
Require valid-user

2.4 configuration:

AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
<RequireAll>
  Require valid-user
  Require ip 127.0.0.1
</RequireAll>

   In configurations where both authentication and access control were
   meaningfully combined, the access control directives should be
   migrated. This example allows requests meeting either criteria:

2.2 configuration:

Order allow,deny
Deny from all
Satisfy any
Allow from 127.0.0.1
AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
Require valid-user

2.4 configuration:

AuthType Basic
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /example.com/conf/users.passwd
AuthName secure
# Implicitly <RequireAny>
Require valid-user
Require ip 127.0.0.1

Other configuration changes

   Some other small adjustments may be necessary for particular
   configurations as discussed below.
     * MaxRequestsPerChild has been renamed to MaxConnectionsPerChild,
       describes more accurately what it does. The old name is still
       supported.
     * MaxClients has been renamed to MaxRequestWorkers, which describes
       more accurately what it does. For async MPMs, like event, the
       maximum number of clients is not equivalent than the number of
       worker threads. The old name is still supported.
     * The DefaultType directive no longer has any effect, other than to
       emit a warning if it's used with any value other than none. You
       need to use other configuration settings to replace it in 2.4.
     * AllowOverride now defaults to None.
     * EnableSendfile now defaults to Off.
     * FileETag now defaults to "MTime Size" (without INode).
     * mod_dav_fs: The format of the DavLockDB file has changed for
       systems with inodes. The old DavLockDB file must be deleted on
       upgrade.
     * KeepAlive only accepts values of On or Off. Previously, any value
       other than "Off" or "0" was treated as "On".
     * Directives AcceptMutex, LockFile, RewriteLock, SSLMutex,
       SSLStaplingMutex, and WatchdogMutexPath have been replaced with a
       single Mutex directive. You will need to evaluate any use of these
       removed directives in your 2.2 configuration to determine if they
       can just be deleted or will need to be replaced using Mutex.
     * mod_cache: CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers now does an exact match
       against the query string instead of a partial match. If your
       configuration was using partial strings, e.g. using sessionid to
       match /someapplication/image.gif;jsessionid=123456789, then you
       will need to change to the full string jsessionid.
     * mod_cache: The second parameter to CacheEnable only matches forward
       proxy content if it begins with the correct protocol. In 2.2 and
       earlier, a parameter of '/' matched all content.
     * mod_ldap: LDAPTrustedClientCert is now consistently a per-directory
       setting only. If you use this directive, review your configuration
       to make sure it is present in all the necessary directory contexts.
     * mod_filter: FilterProvider syntax has changed and now uses a
       boolean expression to determine if a filter is applied.
     * mod_include:
          + The #if expr element now uses the new expression parser. The
            old syntax can be restored with the new directive
            SSILegacyExprParser.
          + An SSI* config directive in directory scope no longer causes
            all other per-directory SSI* directives to be reset to their
            default values.
     * mod_charset_lite: The DebugLevel option has been removed in favour
       of per-module LogLevel configuration.
     * mod_ext_filter: The DebugLevel option has been removed in favour of
       per-module LogLevel configuration.
     * mod_proxy_scgi: The default setting for PATH_INFO has changed from
       httpd 2.2, and some web applications will no longer operate
       properly with the new PATH_INFO setting. The previous setting can
       be restored by configuring the proxy-scgi-pathinfo variable.
     * mod_ssl: CRL based revocation checking now needs to be explicitly
       configured through SSLCARevocationCheck.
     * mod_substitute: The maximum line length is now limited to 1MB.
     * mod_reqtimeout: If the module is loaded, it will now set some
       default timeouts.
     * mod_dumpio: DumpIOLogLevel is no longer supported. Data is always
       logged at LogLevel trace7.
     * On Unix platforms, piped logging commands configured using either
       ErrorLog or CustomLog were invoked using /bin/sh -c in 2.2 and
       earlier. In 2.4 and later, piped logging commands are executed
       directly. To restore the old behaviour, see the piped logging
       documentation.

Misc Changes

     * mod_autoindex: will now extract titles and display descriptions for
       .xhtml files, which were previously ignored.
     * mod_ssl: The default format of the *_DN variables has changed. The
       old format can still be used with the new LegacyDNStringFormat
       argument to SSLOptions. The SSLv2 protocol is no longer supported.
       SSLProxyCheckPeerCN and SSLProxyCheckPeerExpire now default to On,
       causing proxy requests to HTTPS hosts with bad or outdated
       certificates to fail with a 502 status code (Bad gateway)
     * htpasswd now uses MD5 hash by default on all platforms.
     * The NameVirtualHost directive no longer has any effect, other than
       to emit a warning. Any address/port combination appearing in
       multiple virtual hosts is implicitly treated as a name-based
       virtual host.
     * mod_deflate will now skip compression if it knows that the size
       overhead added by the compression is larger than the data to be
       compressed.
     * Multi-language error documents from 2.2.x may not work unless they
       are adjusted to the new syntax of mod_include's #if expr= element
       or the directive SSILegacyExprParser is enabled for the directory
       containing the error documents.
     * The functionality provided by mod_authn_alias in previous versions
       (i.e., the AuthnProviderAlias directive) has been moved into
       mod_authn_core.
     * The RewriteLog and RewriteLogLevel directives have been removed.
       This functionality is now provided by configuring the appropriate
       level of logging for the mod_rewrite module using the LogLevel
       directive. See also the mod_rewrite logging section.

Third Party Modules

   All modules must be recompiled for 2.4 before being loaded.

   Many third-party modules designed for version 2.2 will otherwise work
   unchanged with the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4. Some will require
   changes; see the API update overview.
   top

Common problems when upgrading

     * Startup errors:
          + Invalid command 'User', perhaps misspelled or defined by a
            module not included in the server configuration - load module
            mod_unixd
          + Invalid command 'Require', perhaps misspelled or defined by a
            module not included in the server configuration, or Invalid
            command 'Order', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not
            included in the server configuration - load module
            mod_access_compat, or update configuration to 2.4
            authorization directives.
          + Ignoring deprecated use of DefaultType in line NN of
            /path/to/httpd.conf - remove DefaultType and replace with
            other configuration settings.
          + Invalid command 'AddOutputFilterByType', perhaps misspelled or
            defined by a module not included in the server configuration -
            AddOutputFilterByType has moved from the core to mod_filter,
            which must be loaded.
     * Errors serving requests:
          + configuration error: couldn't check user: /path - load module
            mod_authn_core.
          + .htaccess files aren't being processed - Check for an
            appropriate AllowOverride directive; the default changed to
            None in 2.4.

       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
       been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and
       charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
       other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   This document covers compilation and installation of the Apache HTTP
   Server on Unix and Unix-like systems only. For compiling and
   installation on Windows, see Using Apache HTTP Server with Microsoft
   Windows and Compiling Apache for Microsoft Windows. For other
   platforms, see the platform documentation.

   Apache httpd uses libtool and autoconf to create a build environment
   that looks like many other Open Source projects.

   If you are upgrading from one minor version to the next (for example,
   2.4.9 to 2.4.10), please skip down to the upgrading section.

Overview for the impatient

   Installing on Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux

sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd

          Newer releases of these distros use dnf rather than yum. See the
          Fedora project's documentation for platform-specific notes.

   Installing on Ubuntu/Debian

sudo apt install apache2
sudo service apache2 start

          See Ubuntu's documentation for platform-specific notes.

   Installing from source

   Download Download the latest release from
   http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
   Extract $ gzip -d httpd-NN.tar.gz
   $ tar xvf httpd-NN.tar
   $ cd httpd-NN
   Configure $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
   Compile $ make
   Install $ make install
   Customize $ vi PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf
   Test $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start

          NN must be replaced with the current version number, and PREFIX
          must be replaced with the filesystem path under which the server
          should be installed. If PREFIX is not specified, it defaults to
          /usr/local/apache2.

          Each section of the compilation and installation process is
          described in more detail below, beginning with the requirements
          for compiling and installing Apache httpd.

   this doc.
   top

Requirements

   The following requirements exist for building Apache httpd:

   APR and APR-Util
          Make sure you have APR and APR-Util already installed on your
          system. If you don't, or prefer to not use the system-provided
          versions, download the latest versions of both APR and APR-Util
          from Apache APR, unpack them into
          /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr and
          /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr-util (be sure the directory
          names do not have version numbers; for example, the APR
          distribution must be under /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr/)
          and use ./configure's --with-included-apr option. On some
          platforms, you may have to install the corresponding -dev
          packages to allow httpd to build against your installed copy of
          APR and APR-Util.

   Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions Library (PCRE)
          This library is required but not longer bundled with httpd.
          Download the source code from http://www.pcre.org, or install a
          Port or Package. If your build system can't find the pcre-config
          script installed by the PCRE build, point to it using the
          --with-pcre parameter. On some platforms, you may have to
          install the corresponding -dev package to allow httpd to build
          against your installed copy of PCRE.

   Disk Space
          Make sure you have at least 50 MB of temporary free disk space
          available. After installation the server occupies approximately
          10 MB of disk space. The actual disk space requirements will
          vary considerably based on your chosen configuration options,
          any third-party modules, and, of course, the size of the web
          site or sites that you have on the server.

   ANSI-C Compiler and Build System
          Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C
          compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is
          recommended. If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
          vendor's compiler is ANSI compliant. In addition, your PATH must
          contain basic build tools such as make.

   Accurate time keeping
          Elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as the time of day.
          So, it's time to investigate setting some time synchronization
          facility on your system. Usually the ntpdate or xntpd programs
          are used for this purpose which are based on the Network Time
          Protocol (NTP). See the NTP homepage for more details about NTP
          software and public time servers.

   Perl 5 [OPTIONAL]
          For some of the support scripts like apxs or dbmmanage (which
          are written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required
          (versions 5.003 or newer are sufficient). If no Perl 5
          interpreter is found by the configure script, you will not be
          able to use the affected support scripts. Of course, you will
          still be able to build and use Apache httpd.

   top

Download

   The Apache HTTP Server can be downloaded from the Apache HTTP Server
   download site, which lists several mirrors. Most users of Apache on
   unix-like systems will be better off downloading and compiling a source
   version. The build process (described below) is easy, and it allows you
   to customize your server to suit your needs. In addition, binary
   releases are often not up to date with the latest source releases. If
   you do download a binary, follow the instructions in the
   INSTALL.bindist file inside the distribution.

   After downloading, it is important to verify that you have a complete
   and unmodified version of the Apache HTTP Server. This can be
   accomplished by testing the downloaded tarball against the PGP
   signature. Details on how to do this are available on the download page
   and an extended example is available describing the use of PGP.
   top

Extract

   Extracting the source from the Apache HTTP Server tarball is a simple
   matter of uncompressing, and then untarring:

   $ gzip -d httpd-NN.tar.gz
   $ tar xvf httpd-NN.tar

   This will create a new directory under the current directory containing
   the source code for the distribution. You should cd into that directory
   before proceeding with compiling the server.
   top

Configuring the source tree

   The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your
   particular platform and personal requirements. This is done using the
   script configure included in the root directory of the distribution.
   (Developers downloading an unreleased version of the Apache source tree
   will need to have autoconf and libtool installed and will need to run
   buildconf before proceeding with the next steps. This is not necessary
   for official releases.)

   To configure the source tree using all the default options, simply type
   ./configure. To change the default options, configure accepts a variety
   of variables and command line options.

   The most important option is the location --prefix where Apache is to
   be installed later, because Apache has to be configured for this
   location to work correctly. More fine-tuned control of the location of
   files is possible with additional configure options.

   Also at this point, you can specify which features you want included in
   Apache by enabling and disabling modules. Apache comes with a wide
   range of modules included by default. They will be compiled as shared
   objects (DSOs) which can be loaded or unloaded at runtime. You can also
   choose to compile modules statically by using the option
   --enable-module=static.

   Additional modules are enabled using the --enable-module option, where
   module is the name of the module with the mod_ string removed and with
   any underscore converted to a dash. Similarly, you can disable modules
   with the --disable-module option. Be careful when using these options,
   since configure cannot warn you if the module you specify does not
   exist; it will simply ignore the option.

   In addition, it is sometimes necessary to provide the configure script
   with extra information about the location of your compiler, libraries,
   or header files. This is done by passing either environment variables
   or command line options to configure. For more information, see the
   configure manual page. Or invoke configure using the --help option.

   For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a
   typical example which compiles Apache for the installation tree
   /sw/pkg/apache with a particular compiler and flags plus the two
   additional modules mod_ldap and mod_lua:

   $ CC="pgcc" CFLAGS="-O2" \
   ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
   --enable-ldap=shared \
   --enable-lua=shared

   When configure is run it will take several minutes to test for the
   availability of features on your system and build Makefiles which will
   later be used to compile the server.

   Details on all the different configure options are available on the
   configure manual page.

Build

   Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
   simply running the command:

   $ make

   Please be patient here, since a base configuration takes several
   minutes to compile and the time will vary widely depending on your
   hardware and the number of modules that you have enabled.
   top

Install

   Now it's time to install the package under the configured installation
   PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:

   $ make install

   This step will typically require root privileges, since PREFIX is
   usually a directory with restricted write permissions.

   If you are upgrading, the installation will not overwrite your
   configuration files or documents.
   top

Customize

   Next, you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the
   configuration files under PREFIX/conf/.

   $ vi PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf

   Have a look at the Apache manual under PREFIX/docs/manual/ or consult
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for the most recent version of this
   manual and a complete reference of available configuration directives.
   top

Test

   Now you can start your Apache HTTP server by immediately running:

   $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start

   You should then be able to request your first document via the URL
   http://localhost/. The web page you see is located under the
   DocumentRoot, which will usually be PREFIX/htdocs/. Then stop the
   server again by running:

   $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k stop
   top

Upgrading

   The first step in upgrading is to read the release announcement and the
   file CHANGES in the source distribution to find any changes that may
   affect your site. When changing between major releases (for example,
   from 2.0 to 2.2 or from 2.2 to 2.4), there will likely be major
   differences in the compile-time and run-time configuration that will
   require manual adjustments. All modules will also need to be upgraded
   to accommodate changes in the module API.

   Upgrading from one minor version to the next (for example, from 2.2.55
   to 2.2.57) is easier. The make install process will not overwrite any
   of your existing documents, log files, or configuration files. In
   addition, the developers make every effort to avoid incompatible
   changes in the configure options, run-time configuration, or the module
   API between minor versions. In most cases you should be able to use an
   identical configure command line, an identical configuration file, and
   all of your modules should continue to work.

   To upgrade across minor versions, start by finding the file config.nice
   in the build directory of your installed server or at the root of the
   source tree for your old install. This will contain the exact configure
   command line that you used to configure the source tree. Then to
   upgrade from one version to the next, you need only copy the
   config.nice file to the source tree of the new version, edit it to make
   any desired changes, and then run:

   $ ./config.nice
   $ make
   $ make install
   $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k graceful-stop
   $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start
   You should always test any new version in your environment before
   putting it into production. For example, you can install and run the
   new version along side the old one by using a different --prefix and a
   different port (by adjusting the Listen directive) to test for any
   incompatibilities before doing the final upgrade.

   You can pass additional arguments to config.nice, which will be
   appended to your original configure options:

   $ ./config.nice --prefix=/home/test/apache --with-port=90

Third-party packages

   A large number of third parties provide their own packaged
   distributions of the Apache HTTP Server for installation on particular
   platforms. This includes the various Linux distributions, various
   third-party Windows packages, Mac OS X, Solaris, and many more.

   Our software license not only permits, but encourages, this kind of
   redistribution. However, it does result in a situation where the
   configuration layout and defaults on your installation of the server
   may differ from what is stated in the documentation. While unfortunate,
   this situation is not likely to change any time soon.

   A description of these third-party distrubutions is maintained in the
   HTTP Server wiki, and should reflect the current state of these
   third-party distributions. However, you will need to familiarize
   yourself with your particular platform's package management and
   installation procedures.

   Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4

Starting Apache

   Available Languages:  de  |  en  |  es  |  fr  |  ja  |  ko  |  tr

   On Windows, Apache is normally run as a service. For details, see
   Running Apache as a Service.

   On Unix, the httpd program is run as a daemon that executes
   continuously in the background to handle requests. This document
   describes how to invoke httpd.

How Apache Starts

   If the Listen specified in the configuration file is default of 80 (or
   any other port below 1024), then it is necessary to have root
   privileges in order to start apache, so that it can bind to this
   privileged port. Once the server has started and performed a few
   preliminary activities such as opening its log files, it will launch
   several child processes which do the work of listening for and
   answering requests from clients. The main httpd process continues to
   run as the root user, but the child processes run as a less privileged
   user. This is controlled by the selected Multi-Processing Module.

   The recommended method of invoking the httpd executable is to use the
   apachectl control script. This script sets certain environment
   variables that are necessary for httpd to function correctly under some
   operating systems, and then invokes the httpd binary. apachectl will
   pass through any command line arguments, so any httpd options may also
   be used with apachectl. You may also directly edit the apachectl script
   by changing the HTTPD variable near the top to specify the correct
   location of the httpd binary and any command-line arguments that you
   wish to be always present.

   The first thing that httpd does when it is invoked is to locate and
   read the configuration file httpd.conf. The location of this file is
   set at compile-time, but it is possible to specify its location at run
   time using the -f command-line option as in

   /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -f /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

   If all goes well during startup, the server will detach from the
   terminal and the command prompt will return almost immediately. This
   indicates that the server is up and running. You can then use your
   browser to connect to the server and view the test page in the
   DocumentRoot directory.
   top

Errors During Start-up

   If Apache suffers a fatal problem during startup, it will write a
   message describing the problem either to the console or to the ErrorLog
   before exiting. One of the most common error messages is "Unable to
   bind to Port ...". This message is usually caused by either:
     * Trying to start the server on a privileged port when not logged in
       as the root user; or
     * Trying to start the server when there is another instance of Apache
       or some other web server already bound to the same Port.

   For further trouble-shooting instructions, consult the Apache FAQ.
   top

Starting at Boot-Time

   If you want your server to continue running after a system reboot, you
   should add a call to apachectl to your system startup files (typically
   rc.local or a file in an rc.N directory). This will start Apache as
   root. Before doing this ensure that your server is properly configured
   for security and access restrictions.

   The apachectl script is designed to act like a standard SysV init
   script; it can take the arguments start, restart, and stop and
   translate them into the appropriate signals to httpd. So you can often
   simply link apachectl into the appropriate init directory. But be sure
   to check the exact requirements of your system.

Additional Information

   Additional information about the command-line options of httpd and
   apachectl as well as other support programs included with the server is
   available on the Server and Supporting Programs page. There is also
   documentation on all the modules included with the Apache distribution
   and the directives that they provide.
