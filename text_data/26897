Technical documentation lives here

   Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building,
   versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.

Free docs hosting

   We will host your documentation for free forever. There are no tricks.
   We help tens of thousands of open source projects share their docs.

Webhooks

   Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system, whether
   that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion, we will automatically
   build your docs so your code and documentation are never out of sync.

Multiple formats

   Of course we build and host your docs for the web, but they are also
   vieweable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. No additional
   configuration is required.

Multiple versions

   We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a 1.0
   version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy as
   having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.

Read the Docs is funded by the community

   Read the Docs is a huge resource that millions of developers rely on
   for software documentation. It would not be possible without the
   support of our sponsors, advertisers, and readers like you.

   Read the Docs is community supported. It depends on users like you to
   contribute to development, support, and operations. You can learn more
   about how to contribute in our docs. Thanks so much to our wonderful
   community team who helps us run the site. Read the Docs wouldn't be
   possible without them.

   Hosting for the project is graciously provided by Microsoft Azure.
