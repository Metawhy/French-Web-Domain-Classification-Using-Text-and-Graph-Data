Shooting stars on demand: Japan start-up plans 2020 meteor shower

   A Japanese start-up developing "shooting stars on demand" says it will
   be ready to deliver the world's first artificial meteor shower in a
   spectacular show over Hiroshima in early 2020.

   ALE, based in Tokyo, is in the final stages of developing two
   micro-satellites that will release tiny balls that glow brightly as
   they enter the atmosphere, simulating a meteor shower.

   The first satellite will hitch a ride into space on a rocket being
   launched by Japan's space agency by March 2019.

   The second will be launched in mid-2019 on a private-sector rocket.

   "We are targeting the whole world, as our stockpile of shooting stars
   will be in space and can be delivered across the world," ALE chief
   executive Lena Okajima told reporters on Wednesday.

   Each satellite will be able to carry 400 tiny balls whose chemical
   formula is a closely-guarded secret.

   Ejected from the satellite, the balls will glow as they plunge through
   the atmosphere.

   The 400 balls will be enough for 20-30 events, according to the
   company, and the satellites will be able to stay in space for around
   two years.

   The company is also exploring the possibility of using satellites
   already in space that are no longer operational to create "giant"
   shooting stars, officials said.

   "We are planning to push a used satellite into the atmosphere on a
   targeted orbit to create a giant artificial shooting star," ALE chief
   engineer Ko Kamachi, adding that the idea was still in the basic
   research phase.

   ALE's two satellites will start orbiting the Earth by February 2020,
   preparing for the world's first delivery of artificial shooting stars
   in spring 2020, over the western Japan city of Hiroshima.

   The satellites can be used separately or in tandem, and will be
   programmed to eject the balls at the right location, speed and
   direction to put on a show for viewers on the ground.

   Tinkering with the ingredients in the balls should mean that it is
   possible to change the colours they glow, offering the possibility of a
   multi-coloured flotilla of shooting stars.

   Each star is expected to shine for several seconds before being
   completely burned up—well before they fall low enough to pose any
   danger to anything on Earth.

   They would glow brightly enough to be seen even over the light-polluted
   metropolis of Tokyo.

   If all goes well, and the skies are clear, the 2020 event could be
   visible to millions of people, ALE said.

   Okajima said the company chose Hiroshima for its first display because
   of its good weather, landscape and cultural assets.

   ALE is working in collaboration with scientists and engineers at
   Japanese universities as well as local government officials and
   corporate sponsors.

   It has not disclosed the price for an artificial meteor but it may not
   come so cheap, with the company spending about $20 million for the
   development, production, launch and operation of the two satellites.

   I think they should check in with Chinese and Russian missile early
   warning systems before doing anything they might come to regret.
   That said. This seems like a very expensive (and much less spectacular)
   type of fireworks. What's the point?

Fertilizer use responsible for increase in nitrous oxide in atmosphere

   by University of California - Berkeley

   University of California, Berkeley, chemists have found a smoking gun
   proving that increased fertilizer use over the past 50 years is
   responsible for a dramatic rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide, which is
   a major greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.

   Climate scientists have assumed that the cause of the increased nitrous
   oxide was nitrogen-based fertilizer, which stimulates microbes in the
   soil to convert nitrogen to nitrous oxide at a faster rate than normal.

   The new study, reported in the April issue of the journal Nature
   Geoscience, uses nitrogen isotope data to identify the unmistakable
   fingerprint of fertilizer use in archived air samples from Antarctica
   and Tasmania.

   "Our study is the first to show empirically from the data at hand alone
   that the nitrogen isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has
   changed over time is a fingerprint of fertilizer use," said study
   leader Kristie Boering, a UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and of
   earth and planetary science.

   "We are not vilifying fertilizer. We can't just stop using fertilizer,"
   she added. "But we hope this study will contribute to changes in
   fertilizer use and agricultural practices that will help to mitigate
   the release of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere."

   Since the year 1750, nitrous oxide levels have risen 20 percent  from
   below 270 parts per billion (ppb) to more than 320 ppb. After carbon
   dioxide and methane, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most potent greenhouse
   gas, trapping heat and contributing to global warming. It also destroys
   stratospheric ozone, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet
   rays.

   Not surprisingly, a steep ramp-up in atmospheric nitrous oxide
   coincided with the green revolution that increased dramatically in the
   1960s, when inexpensive, synthetic fertilizer and other developments
   boosted food production worldwide, feeding a burgeoning global
   population.

   Tracking the origin of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, however, is
   difficult because a molecule from a fertilized field looks identical to
   one from a natural forest or the ocean if you only measure total
   concentration. But a quirk of microbial metabolism affects the isotope
   ratio of the nitrogen the N2O microbes give off, producing a telltale
   fingerprint that can be detected with sensitive techniques.
   [INS: :INS]

   Archived air from Cape Grim

   Boering and her colleagues, including former UC Berkeley graduate
   students Sunyoung Park and Phillip Croteau, obtained air samples from
   Antarctic ice, called firn air, dating from 1940 to 2005, and from an
   atmospheric monitoring station at Cape Grim, Tasmania, which has
   archived air back to 1978.

   Analysis of N2O levels in the Cape Grim air samples revealed a seasonal
   cycle, which has been known before. But isotopic measurements by a very
   sensitive isotope ratio mass spectrometer also displayed a seasonal
   cycle, which had not been observed before. At Cape Grim, the isotopes
   show that the seasonal cycle is due both to the circulation of air
   returning from the stratosphere, where N2O is destroyed after an
   average lifetime of 120 years, and to seasonal changes in the ocean,
   most likely upwelling that releases more N2O at some times of year than
   at others.

   "The fact that the isotopic composition of N2O shows a coherent signal
   in space and time is exciting, because now you have a way to
   differentiate agricultural N2O from natural ocean N2O from Amazon
   forest emissions from N2O returning from the stratosphere," Boering
   said. "In addition, you also now have a way to check whether your
   international neighbors are abiding by agreements they've made to
   mitigate N2O emissions. It is a tool that, ultimately, we can use to
   verify whether N2O emissions by agriculture or biofuel production are
   in line with what they say they are."

   Changes in fertilizer use can reduce N2O emissions

   Limiting nitrous oxide emissions could be part of a first step toward
   reducing all greenhouse gases and lessening global warming, Boering
   said, especially since immediately reducing global carbon dioxide
   emissions is proving difficult from a political standpoint. In
   particular, reducing nitrous oxide emissions can initially offset more
   than its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions overall, since N2O
   traps heat at a different wavelength than CO2 and clogs a "window" that
   allows Earth to cool off independent of CO2 levels.

   "On a pound for pound basis, it is really worthwhile to figure how to
   limit our emissions of N2O and methane," she said. "Limiting N2O
   emissions can buy us a little more time in figuring out how to reduce
   CO2 emissions."

   One approach, for example, is to time fertilizer application to avoid
   rain, because wet and happy soil microbes can produce sudden bursts of
   nitrous oxide. Changes in the way fields are tilled, when they are
   fertilized and how much is used can reduce N2O production.

   Boering's studies, which involve analyzing the isotopic fingerprints of
   nitrous oxide from different sources, could help farmers determine
   which strategies are most effective. It could also help assess the
   potential negative impacts of growing crops for biofuels, since some
   feedstocks may require fertilizer that will generate N2O that offsets
   their carbon neutrality.

   "This new evidence of the budget of nitrous oxide allows us to better
   predict its future changes and therefore its impacts on climate and
   stratospheric ozone depletion - for different scenarios of fertilizer
   use in support of rising populations and increased production for
   bio-energy," said coauthor David Etheridge of the Centre for Australian
   Weather and Climate Research in Aspendale, Victoria.

   Finding the fingerprint of fertilized microbes

   Boering was able to trace the source of N2O because bacteria in a
   nitrogen rich environment, such as a freshly fertilized field, prefer
   to incorporate nitrogen-14 (14N), the most common isotope, instead of
   nitrogen-15 (15N).

   "Microbes on a spa weekend can afford to discriminate against
   nitrogen-15, so the fingerprint of N2O from a fertilized field is a
   greater proportion of nitrogen-14," Boering said. "Our study is the
   first to show empirically from the data at hand alone that the nitrogen
   isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has changed over time is a
   fingerprint of fertilizer use."

   Just as telling is the isotope ratio of the central nitrogen atom in
   the N-N-O molecule. By measuring the nitrogen isotope ratio overall,
   the isotope ratio in the central nitrogen atom, and contrasting these
   with the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 isotope ratio, which has not changed over
   the past 65 years, they were able to paint a consistent picture
   pointing at fertilizer as the major source of increased atmospheric N2O
   .

   The isotope ratios also revealed that fertilizer use has caused a shift
   in the way soil microbes produce N2O. The relative output of bacteria
   that produce N2O by nitrification grew from 13 to 23 percent worldwide,
   while the relative output of bacteria that produce N2O by
   denitrification  typically in the absence of oxygen  dropped from 87
   to 77 percent. Although the numbers themselves are uncertain, these are
   the first numerical estimates of these global trends over time, made
   possible by the unique archived air dataset of this study.

   And these fertilizer calculations don't include the conversion of Asia
   from a manure based ag technology to the current in process conversion
   to NPK based ag technology.
   Another good reason why we shouldn't be wasting food fertilizers on
   biofuel production. Some calculations suggest that a global biofuel
   industry would quadruple our use of NPK fertilizer. Not only are
   biofuels not renewable, sustainable clearly they aren't environmentally
   dependent as long as they use NPK fertilizer.

   A good fertilization program helps prevent starvation, so what's the
   big deal? Corn has to have Nitrogen or else the plants don't do well.
   Is it better to have the world starving? That is cruel and inhumane.

   Russkiycremepuff > The idea is to get the nitrogen into the plants, and
   not into run off water or back into the atmosphere. How the plant waste
   is recycled is also important as the nitrogen should be made available
   to the next generation of plants. There is nothing here about the
   oxygen isotope ratio variations in N2O.

Carbon uptake by Amazon forests matches region's emissions

   by University of Leeds

   University of Leeds

   Carbon emissions across all nine Amazon nations have been fully matched
   by carbon absorption by mature Amazon forests since the 1980s, new
   research shows.

   Study lead author Professor Oliver Phillips, from the University of
   Leeds, said: "Since 1980 roughly 430 million tonnes of carbon has been
   absorbed by pristine Amazon rainforest each year, which is almost four
   times the UK emissions for 2016.

   "For the nations of the Amazon basin as a whole this means that since
   1980 the carbon uptake has matched the entire combined emissions from
   deforestation and fossil fuels."

   Co -author Dr Roel Brienen, also from the Leeds School of Geography,
   said: "This reveals the sheer scale of the ecosystem service the Amazon
   forests are providing.

   "We've known that the Amazon rainforest forest provides a 'carbon sink'
   but until now no one had looked at those absorption figures in the
   context of national boundaries. We found that in nearly every nation
   carbon uptake has outstripped emissions from fossil fuels."

   The Amazon rainforest's carbon sink, also known as carbon
   sequestration, is the process by which the forest removes and stores
   carbon from the atmosphere.

   A study, published in Carbon Balance and Management, compared estimates
   of the Amazon rainforest carbon sink to fossil fuel emissions data from
   the nine countries where mature Amazon forests are found – Brazil,
   Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and
   Venezuela, as well as emissions from forest loss and degradation.

   the Amazon nations' carbon fluxes from 1980-2010. Credit: University of
   Leeds

   The estimates for the Amazon's carbon uptake were gathered from more
   than 300 mature forest plots across the five million square kilometres
   of remaining Amazon forest, each tracked for up to 30 years. These
   plots were monitored by more than 100 researchers in the RAINFOR
   network – a unique research network dedicated to monitoring the Amazon
   forests.

   The study showed that since 1980 in almost every Amazon nation the
   average annual carbon uptake into mature forests has been at least
   twice the size of the nation's fossil fuels emissions. The study also
   found that for all nations except Venezuela and Brazil uptake exceeded
   the combined emissions from burning fossil fuels and carbon emission
   from deforestation and forest degradation.
   [INS: :INS]

   However, this balance is on a knife edge. The study showed carbon
   emissions from all nine nations have been increasing and the gap
   between uptake by mature forests and those emissions is getting
   smaller. This is partly due to the increased rate in which Amazon trees
   are dying as recent RAINFOR research has shown.

   Professor Phillips said: "While forest replanting and regrowth also
   help counter emissions, our study suggests that the uptake from these
   'secondary forests' is significantly smaller than those of mature
   forests.

   "This shows that losses from deforestation can have overwhelming
   impacts on carbon balance and further underlines the importance of
   conservation measures to keep the Amazon rainforests intact.

   "Many of us are waking up to the challenge of the two degree climate
   change target set in the Paris Agreement. But less appreciated is the
   fact that – so far – we have been getting a free ride, with global
   forests and oceans mopping up more than half our carbon waste.

   "Every Amazon nation conserving large areas of their forests has been
   contributing globally-significant carbon sequestration. By protecting
   their forests, the countries of South America are doing the rest of us
   a big favour."

     "This shows that losses from deforestation can have overwhelming
     impacts on carbon balance and further underlines the importance of
     conservation measures to keep the Amazon rainforests intact.

   I agree, there should be a major effort to reduce, stop, and recover
   from amazon deforestation. Perhaps if we'd focus more effort onto this
   real problem and solutions rather than on fear mongering about CO2
   emissions we could actually achieve something.

Shooting stars on demand: Japan start-up plans 2020 meteor shower

   meteor Credit: CC0 Public Domain
   A Japanese start-up developing "shooting stars on demand" says it will
   be ready to deliver the world's first artificial meteor shower in a
   spectacular show over Hiroshima in early 2020.

   ALE, based in Tokyo, is in the final stages of developing two
   micro-satellites that will release tiny balls that glow brightly as
   they enter the atmosphere, simulating a meteor shower.

   The first satellite will hitch a ride into space on a rocket being
   launched by Japan's space agency by March 2019.

   The second will be launched in mid-2019 on a private-sector rocket.

   "We are targeting the whole world, as our stockpile of shooting stars
   will be in space and can be delivered across the world," ALE chief
   executive Lena Okajima told reporters on Wednesday.

   Each satellite will be able to carry 400 tiny balls whose chemical
   formula is a closely-guarded secret.

   Ejected from the satellite, the balls will glow as they plunge through
   the atmosphere.

   The 400 balls will be enough for 20-30 events, according to the
   company, and the satellites will be able to stay in space for around
   two years.

   The company is also exploring the possibility of using satellites
   already in space that are no longer operational to create "giant"
   shooting stars, officials said.

   "We are planning to push a used satellite into the atmosphere on a
   targeted orbit to create a giant artificial shooting star," ALE chief
   engineer Ko Kamachi, adding that the idea was still in the basic
   research phase.

   ALE's two satellites will start orbiting the Earth by February 2020,
   preparing for the world's first delivery of artificial shooting stars
   in spring 2020, over the western Japan city of Hiroshima.

   The satellites can be used separately or in tandem, and will be
   programmed to eject the balls at the right location, speed and
   direction to put on a show for viewers on the ground.

   Tinkering with the ingredients in the balls should mean that it is
   possible to change the colours they glow, offering the possibility of a
   multi-coloured flotilla of shooting stars.

   Each star is expected to shine for several seconds before being
   completely burned up—well before they fall low enough to pose any
   danger to anything on Earth.

   They would glow brightly enough to be seen even over the light-polluted
   metropolis of Tokyo.

   If all goes well, and the skies are clear, the 2020 event could be
   visible to millions of people, ALE said.

   Okajima said the company chose Hiroshima for its first display because
   of its good weather, landscape and cultural assets.

   ALE is working in collaboration with scientists and engineers at
   Japanese universities as well as local government officials and
   corporate sponsors.

   It has not disclosed the price for an artificial meteor but it may not
   come so cheap, with the company spending about $20 million for the
   development, production, launch and operation of the two satellites.

   I think they should check in with Chinese and Russian missile early

   That said. This seems like a very expensive (and much less spectacular)

Fertilizer use responsible for increase in nitrous oxide in atmosphere

   by University of California - Berkeley

   University of California, Berkeley, chemists have found a smoking gun
   proving that increased fertilizer use over the past 50 years is
   responsible for a dramatic rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide, which is
   a major greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.

   Climate scientists have assumed that the cause of the increased nitrous
   oxide was nitrogen-based fertilizer, which stimulates microbes in the
   soil to convert nitrogen to nitrous oxide at a faster rate than normal.

   The new study, reported in the April issue of the journal Nature
   Geoscience, uses nitrogen isotope data to identify the unmistakable
   fingerprint of fertilizer use in archived air samples from Antarctica
   and Tasmania.

   "Our study is the first to show empirically from the data at hand alone
   that the nitrogen isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has
   changed over time is a fingerprint of fertilizer use," said study
   leader Kristie Boering, a UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and of
   earth and planetary science.

   "We are not vilifying fertilizer. We can't just stop using fertilizer,"
   she added. "But we hope this study will contribute to changes in
   fertilizer use and agricultural practices that will help to mitigate
   the release of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere."

   Since the year 1750, nitrous oxide levels have risen 20 percent  from
   below 270 parts per billion (ppb) to more than 320 ppb. After carbon
   dioxide and methane, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most potent greenhouse
   gas, trapping heat and contributing to global warming. It also destroys
   stratospheric ozone, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet
   rays.

   Not surprisingly, a steep ramp-up in atmospheric nitrous oxide
   coincided with the green revolution that increased dramatically in the
   1960s, when inexpensive, synthetic fertilizer and other developments
   boosted food production worldwide, feeding a burgeoning global
   population.

   Tracking the origin of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, however, is
   difficult because a molecule from a fertilized field looks identical to
   one from a natural forest or the ocean if you only measure total
   concentration. But a quirk of microbial metabolism affects the isotope
   ratio of the nitrogen the N2O microbes give off, producing a telltale
   fingerprint that can be detected with sensitive techniques.
   [INS: :INS]

   Archived air from Cape Grim

   Boering and her colleagues, including former UC Berkeley graduate
   students Sunyoung Park and Phillip Croteau, obtained air samples from
   Antarctic ice, called firn air, dating from 1940 to 2005, and from an
   atmospheric monitoring station at Cape Grim, Tasmania, which has
   archived air back to 1978.

   Analysis of N2O levels in the Cape Grim air samples revealed a seasonal
   cycle, which has been known before. But isotopic measurements by a very
   sensitive isotope ratio mass spectrometer also displayed a seasonal
   cycle, which had not been observed before. At Cape Grim, the isotopes
   show that the seasonal cycle is due both to the circulation of air
   returning from the stratosphere, where N2O is destroyed after an
   average lifetime of 120 years, and to seasonal changes in the ocean,
   most likely upwelling that releases more N2O at some times of year than
   at others.

   "The fact that the isotopic composition of N2O shows a coherent signal
   in space and time is exciting, because now you have a way to
   differentiate agricultural N2O from natural ocean N2O from Amazon
   forest emissions from N2O returning from the stratosphere," Boering
   said. "In addition, you also now have a way to check whether your
   international neighbors are abiding by agreements they've made to
   mitigate N2O emissions. It is a tool that, ultimately, we can use to
   verify whether N2O emissions by agriculture or biofuel production are
   in line with what they say they are."

   Changes in fertilizer use can reduce N2O emissions

   Limiting nitrous oxide emissions could be part of a first step toward
   reducing all greenhouse gases and lessening global warming, Boering
   said, especially since immediately reducing global carbon dioxide
   emissions is proving difficult from a political standpoint. In
   particular, reducing nitrous oxide emissions can initially offset more
   than its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions overall, since N2O
   traps heat at a different wavelength than CO2 and clogs a "window" that
   allows Earth to cool off independent of CO2 levels.

   "On a pound for pound basis, it is really worthwhile to figure how to
   limit our emissions of N2O and methane," she said. "Limiting N2O
   emissions can buy us a little more time in figuring out how to reduce
   CO2 emissions."

   One approach, for example, is to time fertilizer application to avoid
   rain, because wet and happy soil microbes can produce sudden bursts of
   nitrous oxide. Changes in the way fields are tilled, when they are
   fertilized and how much is used can reduce N2O production.

   Boering's studies, which involve analyzing the isotopic fingerprints of
   nitrous oxide from different sources, could help farmers determine
   which strategies are most effective. It could also help assess the
   potential negative impacts of growing crops for biofuels, since some
   feedstocks may require fertilizer that will generate N2O that offsets
   their carbon neutrality.

   "This new evidence of the budget of nitrous oxide allows us to better
   predict its future changes and therefore its impacts on climate and
   stratospheric ozone depletion - for different scenarios of fertilizer
   use in support of rising populations and increased production for
   bio-energy," said coauthor David Etheridge of the Centre for Australian
   Weather and Climate Research in Aspendale, Victoria.

   Finding the fingerprint of fertilized microbes

   Boering was able to trace the source of N2O because bacteria in a
   nitrogen rich environment, such as a freshly fertilized field, prefer
   to incorporate nitrogen-14 (14N), the most common isotope, instead of
   nitrogen-15 (15N).

   "Microbes on a spa weekend can afford to discriminate against
   nitrogen-15, so the fingerprint of N2O from a fertilized field is a
   greater proportion of nitrogen-14," Boering said. "Our study is the
   first to show empirically from the data at hand alone that the nitrogen
   isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has changed over time is a
   fingerprint of fertilizer use."

   Just as telling is the isotope ratio of the central nitrogen atom in
   the N-N-O molecule. By measuring the nitrogen isotope ratio overall,
   the isotope ratio in the central nitrogen atom, and contrasting these
   with the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 isotope ratio, which has not changed over
   the past 65 years, they were able to paint a consistent picture
   pointing at fertilizer as the major source of increased atmospheric N2O
   .

   The isotope ratios also revealed that fertilizer use has caused a shift
   in the way soil microbes produce N2O. The relative output of bacteria
   that produce N2O by nitrification grew from 13 to 23 percent worldwide,
   while the relative output of bacteria that produce N2O by
   denitrification  typically in the absence of oxygen  dropped from 87
   to 77 percent. Although the numbers themselves are uncertain, these are
   the first numerical estimates of these global trends over time, made
   possible by the unique archived air dataset of this study.

   And these fertilizer calculations don't include the conversion of Asia
   from a manure based ag technology to the current in process conversion
   to NPK based ag technology.
   Another good reason why we shouldn't be wasting food fertilizers on
   biofuel production. Some calculations suggest that a global biofuel
   industry would quadruple our use of NPK fertilizer. Not only are
   biofuels not renewable, sustainable clearly they aren't environmentally
   dependent as long as they use NPK fertilizer.

   A good fertilization program helps prevent starvation, so what's the
   big deal? Corn has to have Nitrogen or else the plants don't do well.
   Is it better to have the world starving? That is cruel and inhumane.

   Russkiycremepuff > The idea is to get the nitrogen into the plants, and
   not into run off water or back into the atmosphere. How the plant waste
   is recycled is also important as the nitrogen should be made available
   to the next generation of plants. There is nothing here about the
   oxygen isotope ratio variations in N2O.

Carbon uptake by Amazon forests matches region's emissions

   by University of Leeds
   Carbon uptake by Amazon forests matches region's emissions Credit:
   University of Leeds

   Carbon emissions across all nine Amazon nations have been fully matched
   by carbon absorption by mature Amazon forests since the 1980s, new
   research shows.

   Study lead author Professor Oliver Phillips, from the University of
   Leeds, said: "Since 1980 roughly 430 million tonnes of carbon has been
   absorbed by pristine Amazon rainforest each year, which is almost four
   times the UK emissions for 2016.

   "For the nations of the Amazon basin as a whole this means that since
   1980 the carbon uptake has matched the entire combined emissions from
   deforestation and fossil fuels."

   Co -author Dr Roel Brienen, also from the Leeds School of Geography,
   said: "This reveals the sheer scale of the ecosystem service the Amazon
   forests are providing.

   "We've known that the Amazon rainforest forest provides a 'carbon sink'
   but until now no one had looked at those absorption figures in the
   context of national boundaries. We found that in nearly every nation
   carbon uptake has outstripped emissions from fossil fuels."

   The Amazon rainforest's carbon sink, also known as carbon
   sequestration, is the process by which the forest removes and stores
   carbon from the atmosphere.

   A study, published in Carbon Balance and Management, compared estimates
   of the Amazon rainforest carbon sink to fossil fuel emissions data from
   the nine countries where mature Amazon forests are found – Brazil,
   Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and
   Venezuela, as well as emissions from forest loss and degradation.

   the Amazon nations' carbon fluxes from 1980-2010. Credit: University of
   Leeds

   The estimates for the Amazon's carbon uptake were gathered from more
   than 300 mature forest plots across the five million square kilometres
   of remaining Amazon forest, each tracked for up to 30 years. These
   plots were monitored by more than 100 researchers in the RAINFOR
   network – a unique research network dedicated to monitoring the Amazon
   forests.

   The study showed that since 1980 in almost every Amazon nation the
   average annual carbon uptake into mature forests has been at least
   twice the size of the nation's fossil fuels emissions. The study also
   found that for all nations except Venezuela and Brazil uptake exceeded
   the combined emissions from burning fossil fuels and carbon emission
   from deforestation and forest degradation.
   [INS: :INS]

   However, this balance is on a knife edge. The study showed carbon
   emissions from all nine nations have been increasing and the gap
   between uptake by mature forests and those emissions is getting
   smaller. This is partly due to the increased rate in which Amazon trees
   are dying as recent RAINFOR research has shown.

   Professor Phillips said: "While forest replanting and regrowth also
   help counter emissions, our study suggests that the uptake from these
   'secondary forests' is significantly smaller than those of mature
   forests.

   "This shows that losses from deforestation can have overwhelming
   impacts on carbon balance and further underlines the importance of
   conservation measures to keep the Amazon rainforests intact.

   "Many of us are waking up to the challenge of the two degree climate
   change target set in the Paris Agreement. But less appreciated is the
   fact that – so far – we have been getting a free ride, with global
   forests and oceans mopping up more than half our carbon waste.

   "Every Amazon nation conserving large areas of their forests has been
   contributing globally-significant carbon sequestration. By protecting
   their forests, the countries of South America are doing the rest of us
   a big favour."

     "This shows that losses from deforestation can have overwhelming
     impacts on carbon balance and further underlines the importance of
     conservation measures to keep the Amazon rainforests intact.

   I agree, there should be a major effort to reduce, stop, and recover
   from amazon deforestation. Perhaps if we'd focus more effort onto this
   real problem and solutions rather than on fear mongering about CO2
   emissions we could actually achieve something.

Shooting stars on demand: Japan start-up plans 2020 meteor shower

July 19, 2018

   Would you like to receive trending story notifications on your
   smartphone?

   Credit: CC0 Public Domain A Japanese start-up developing "shooting
   stars on demand" says it will be ready to deliver the world's first
   artificial meteor shower in a spectacular show over Hiroshima in early
   2020.

   ALE, based in Tokyo, is in the final stages of developing two
   micro-satellites that will release tiny balls that glow brightly as
   they enter the atmosphere, simulating a meteor shower.

   The first satellite will hitch a ride into space on a rocket being
   launched by Japan's space agency by March 2019.

   The second will be launched in mid-2019 on a private-sector rocket.

   "We are targeting the whole world, as our stockpile of shooting stars
   will be in space and can be delivered across the world," ALE chief
   executive Lena Okajima told reporters on Wednesday.

   Each satellite will be able to carry 400 tiny balls whose chemical
   formula is a closely-guarded secret.

   Ejected from the satellite, the balls will glow as they plunge through
   the atmosphere.

   The 400 balls will be enough for 20-30 events, according to the
   company, and the satellites will be able to stay in space for around
   two years.

   The company is also exploring the possibility of using satellites
   already in space that are no longer operational to create "giant"
   shooting stars, officials said.

   "We are planning to push a used satellite into the atmosphere on a
   targeted orbit to create a giant artificial shooting star," ALE chief
   engineer Ko Kamachi, adding that the idea was still in the basic
   research phase.

   ALE's two satellites will start orbiting the Earth by February 2020,
   preparing for the world's first delivery of artificial shooting stars
   in spring 2020, over the western Japan city of Hiroshima.

   The satellites can be used separately or in tandem, and will be
   programmed to eject the balls at the right location, speed and
   direction to put on a show for viewers on the ground.

   Tinkering with the ingredients in the balls should mean that it is
   possible to change the colours they glow, offering the possibility of a
   multi-coloured flotilla of shooting stars.

   Each star is expected to shine for several seconds before being
   completely burned up—well before they fall low enough to pose any
   danger to anything on Earth.

   They would glow brightly enough to be seen even over the light-polluted
   metropolis of Tokyo.

   If all goes well, and the skies are clear, the 2020 event could be
   visible to millions of people, ALE said.

   Okajima said the company chose Hiroshima for its first display because
   of its good weather, landscape and cultural assets.

   ALE is working in collaboration with scientists and engineers at
   Japanese universities as well as local government officials and
   corporate sponsors.

   It has not disclosed the price for an artificial meteor but it may not
   come so cheap, with the company spending about $20 million for the
   development, production, launch and operation of the two satellites.

Fertilizer use responsible for increase in nitrous oxide in atmosphere

April 2, 2012
University of California - Berkeley

   Would you like to receive trending story notifications on your
   smartphone?

   University of California, Berkeley, chemists have found a smoking gun
   proving that increased fertilizer use over the past 50 years is
   responsible for a dramatic rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide, which is
   a major greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.

   Climate scientists have assumed that the cause of the increased nitrous
   oxide was nitrogen-based fertilizer, which stimulates microbes in the
   soil to convert nitrogen to nitrous oxide at a faster rate than normal.

   The new study, reported in the April issue of the journal Nature
   Geoscience, uses nitrogen isotope data to identify the unmistakable
   fingerprint of fertilizer use in archived air samples from Antarctica
   and Tasmania.

   "Our study is the first to show empirically from the data at hand alone
   that the nitrogen isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has
   changed over time is a fingerprint of fertilizer use," said study
   leader Kristie Boering, a UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and of
   earth and planetary science.

   "We are not vilifying fertilizer. We can't just stop using fertilizer,"
   she added. "But we hope this study will contribute to changes in
   fertilizer use and agricultural practices that will help to mitigate
   the release of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere."

   Since the year 1750, nitrous oxide levels have risen 20 percent  from
   below 270 parts per billion (ppb) to more than 320 ppb. After carbon
   dioxide and methane, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most potent greenhouse
   gas, trapping heat and contributing to global warming. It also destroys
   stratospheric ozone, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet
   rays.

   Not surprisingly, a steep ramp-up in atmospheric nitrous oxide
   coincided with the green revolution that increased dramatically in the
   1960s, when inexpensive, synthetic fertilizer and other developments
   boosted food production worldwide, feeding a burgeoning global
   population.

   Tracking the origin of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, however, is
   difficult because a molecule from a fertilized field looks identical to
   one from a natural forest or the ocean if you only measure total
   concentration. But a quirk of microbial metabolism affects the isotope
   ratio of the nitrogen the N2O microbes give off, producing a telltale
   fingerprint that can be detected with sensitive techniques.

   Archived air from Cape Grim

   Boering and her colleagues, including former UC Berkeley graduate
   students Sunyoung Park and Phillip Croteau, obtained air samples from
   Antarctic ice, called firn air, dating from 1940 to 2005, and from an
   atmospheric monitoring station at Cape Grim, Tasmania, which has
   archived air back to 1978.

   Analysis of N2O levels in the Cape Grim air samples revealed a seasonal
   cycle, which has been known before. But isotopic measurements by a very
   sensitive isotope ratio mass spectrometer also displayed a seasonal
   cycle, which had not been observed before. At Cape Grim, the isotopes
   show that the seasonal cycle is due both to the circulation of air
   returning from the stratosphere, where N2O is destroyed after an
   average lifetime of 120 years, and to seasonal changes in the ocean,
   most likely upwelling that releases more N2O at some times of year than
   at others.

   "The fact that the isotopic composition of N2O shows a coherent signal
   in space and time is exciting, because now you have a way to
   differentiate agricultural N2O from natural ocean N2O from Amazon
   forest emissions from N2O returning from the stratosphere," Boering
   said. "In addition, you also now have a way to check whether your
   international neighbors are abiding by agreements they've made to
   mitigate N2O emissions. It is a tool that, ultimately, we can use to
   verify whether N2O emissions by agriculture or biofuel production are
   in line with what they say they are."

   Changes in fertilizer use can reduce N2O emissions

   Limiting nitrous oxide emissions could be part of a first step toward
   reducing all greenhouse gases and lessening global warming, Boering
   said, especially since immediately reducing global carbon dioxide
   emissions is proving difficult from a political standpoint. In
   particular, reducing nitrous oxide emissions can initially offset more
   than its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions overall, since N2O
   traps heat at a different wavelength than CO2 and clogs a "window" that
   allows Earth to cool off independent of CO2 levels.

   "On a pound for pound basis, it is really worthwhile to figure how to
   limit our emissions of N2O and methane," she said. "Limiting N2O
   emissions can buy us a little more time in figuring out how to reduce
   CO2 emissions."

   One approach, for example, is to time fertilizer application to avoid
   rain, because wet and happy soil microbes can produce sudden bursts of
   nitrous oxide. Changes in the way fields are tilled, when they are
   fertilized and how much is used can reduce N2O production.

   Boering's studies, which involve analyzing the isotopic fingerprints of
   nitrous oxide from different sources, could help farmers determine
   which strategies are most effective. It could also help assess the
   potential negative impacts of growing crops for biofuels, since some
   feedstocks may require fertilizer that will generate N2O that offsets
   their carbon neutrality.

   "This new evidence of the budget of nitrous oxide allows us to better
   predict its future changes and therefore its impacts on climate and
   stratospheric ozone depletion - for different scenarios of fertilizer
   use in support of rising populations and increased production for
   bio-energy," said coauthor David Etheridge of the Centre for Australian
   Weather and Climate Research in Aspendale, Victoria.

   Finding the fingerprint of fertilized microbes

   Boering was able to trace the source of N2O because bacteria in a
   nitrogen rich environment, such as a freshly fertilized field, prefer
   to incorporate nitrogen-14 (14N), the most common isotope, instead of
   nitrogen-15 (15N).

   "Microbes on a spa weekend can afford to discriminate against
   nitrogen-15, so the fingerprint of N2O from a fertilized field is a
   greater proportion of nitrogen-14," Boering said. "Our study is the
   first to show empirically from the data at hand alone that the nitrogen
   isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has changed over time is a
   fingerprint of fertilizer use."

   Just as telling is the isotope ratio of the central nitrogen atom in
   the N-N-O molecule. By measuring the nitrogen isotope ratio overall,
   the isotope ratio in the central nitrogen atom, and contrasting these
   with the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 isotope ratio, which has not changed over
   the past 65 years, they were able to paint a consistent picture
   pointing at fertilizer as the major source of increased atmospheric N2O
   .

   The isotope ratios also revealed that fertilizer use has caused a shift
   in the way soil microbes produce N2O. The relative output of bacteria
   that produce N2O by nitrification grew from 13 to 23 percent worldwide,
   while the relative output of bacteria that produce N2O by
   denitrification  typically in the absence of oxygen  dropped from 87
   to 77 percent. Although the numbers themselves are uncertain, these are
   the first numerical estimates of these global trends over time, made
   possible by the unique archived air dataset of this study.
