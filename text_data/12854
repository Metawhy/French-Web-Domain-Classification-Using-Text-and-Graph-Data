EWG-DSS 30th Anniversary

   Apart from being the 5th EWG-DSS annual International Conference on
   Decision Support System Technology, the ICDSST 2019 has also the
   objective of celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the EURO Working Group
   of Decision Support Systems EWG-DSS, created as a product of the ESI VI
   EURO Summer Institute on DSS, in the Madeira island in May 1989. Since
   then, the research area in DSS has substantially advanced and the
   EWG-DSS has consolidated its importance among the EURO Working Groups,
   by currently being one of its most stable and active groups considering
   its research initiatives and activities.

   Since the foundation of the EWG-DSS, the number of members has
   substantially grown along the years. Now we are over 320 registered
   members coming from various nationalities. There has also been
   established quiet a few well-qualified research co-operations within
   the group members, which have generated valuable contributions to the
   DSS field in journal publications.

   Most of the participants of the original DSS EURO Summer Institute in
   Madeira in 1989 are expected to take part in the EWG-DSS 30th
   Anniversary Celebration!

   If you are one of the EWG-DSS founding members, do not wait to be
   contacted first. Get in touch for arrangements of your participation in
   the ICDSST 2019!
