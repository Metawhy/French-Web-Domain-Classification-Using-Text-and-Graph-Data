Cars Birthday Invite

   Asa has been planning his birthday party for months, literally.  Now
   we're finally getting close!  He's hooked on Cars and decided that's
   what he wanted when Safeway displayed a fantastic Cars cake.
   My little buddy's been giving me all the details over and over, "My
   friends will come over, we'll play upstairs, eat Cars cake and
   chocolate milk, or something okay??!"  So that's what we're doing!
   His ideal guest list includes his cousins in Seattle (in case they're
   reading this......).
   He helped me design his invites today. (I didn't want it to be an exact
   picture of Lightning McQueen so this is what we came up with!)

Blog Under Construction

   Sorry for the lack of posts! I'm currently working on getting
   everything switched over to a new site which will be at
   kathrynchurch.com. It's coming along, slowly, but I'm hoping to get the
   finished thing up soon!
   Thanks for your patience!

Oscar Party Inspiration

   [TwigandThistle_Oscar_Table_1-500x753.jpg]
   Twig and Thistle always comes up with such fun looking Oscar parties!
   I've been waiting for an excuse to build an oreo cake so perhaps this
   will be the year?!  We haven't seen most of the movies, but we enjoy
   watching the awards!  And oscar bingo is pretty fun!

Happy Valentine's Day

   [valentines.jpg]
   I'm afraid I didn't take a single picture of the Valentine's flowers -
   it was just too crazy!  But this ombre cake is really fun!  I wouldn't
   mind a large slice (the other cakes featured looked just as good so you
   should head over and take a look!!).
   Featured on Style Me Pretty and made by the Sweet and Saucy Shop
   Trust you all had a wonderful Valentine's Day!!
