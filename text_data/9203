   Praise for Substance Designer

   "Few Applications have transformed my workflow and creativity as much
   as Substance Designer. It’s design gives artists full control over
   their own tool-sets and automation opportunities, which only leads to
   deeper technical understanding and greater creative expression. In
   today’s production environment, it’s simply hard to imagine a workflow
   without Substance."

   - Bradford Smith, Senior Texture / Material Artist, Epic Games



   "Substance Designer changed my approach to creating materials for
   high-end VFX shots."

   – Marc Austin, Lead TD Generalist at Double Negative



   "Iteration in the early concept phase is something our designers want
   and Substance provides the flexibility to do it."

   – David Nikel, Digital Model Manager at Hyundai California Design
   Studio



   "Substance Designer is at the heart of my material workflow."

   – Scott de Woody, Firmwide Creative Media Manager, Gensler

   Polycount Greentooth Awards

   2017 Winner

   3D World

   "The issues with this release are so few and far between that it’s
