About ODEITH

   Odeith was born in 1976, in Damaia (Portugal). He held a spray can for
   the first time in the mid 1980’s. In the 90’s, when graffiti began its
   dissemination throughout Portugal and began to leave its Portuguese
   birthplace, Carcavelos, Odeith had his first contact with this
   movement. His first experiences were sketching on street walls and
   train tracks. The passion he had always shown for drawing had found a
   new purpose and began to evolve. Soon after came the opportunity to
   paint large scale murals in Damaia, Carcavelos, and in many social
   housing neighborhoods, such as Cova da Moura, 6 de Maio and Santa
   Filomena.

   Early on Odeith showed a special interest in perspective and shading.
   In an obscure style which he later called “sombre 3D”, the
   compositions, landscapes or portraits, messages or homages, stood out
   for their realism and technique.

   In 2005 Odeith was internationally recognized for his groundbreaking
   incursions in the anamorphic art field, standing out for his
   compositions created in perspective and painted on different surfaces,
   such as 90º corners or from the wall to the floor, creating an optical
   illusion 3-D effect. In 2008, he decided to close his tattoo studio
   (which he opened in 1999) and moved to London.

   Currently, back in Lisbon, Odeith has been solely focused on painting,
   having created large scale murals for major national and international
   enterprises.
