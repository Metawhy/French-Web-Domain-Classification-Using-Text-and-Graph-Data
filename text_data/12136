Give yourself all the chance to win your run and prepare to run the London
marathon, other long runs or half marathons with a sports physiotherapist &
osteopath

   Posted on 28th May 201920th June 2019 by londonhomevisitphysiotherapy

   The London Marathon is one of the most exciting races to participate
   in. With over 35,000 runners at the starting line, it can be
   exhilarating and gruelling at the same time. Most of the work you need,
   in order to complete the race, is done in the months leading up to it.
   Correct preparation is key to your success and a personal trainer can
   help you stay focused on your goal. But most importantly, a specialised
   sports physio or osteo can help you recover faster from your training,
   help you with stretching and strengthening, work on your joints and
   back to minimise the impact of long running, and help you recover
   faster from eventual injuries in order to avoid missing your training
   for too long. Whether you are a beginner or seasoned runner, our team
   can help you get the best out of yourself.

   We now spend an average of 9 hours sitting daily whether at work, home
   or in a car.

   These hours are prolonged periods of inactivity, often working on badly
   designed workstations and are linked to an increase in obesity but
   also muscular pain, back and neck issues, thrombosis and as well as
   tendinitis. Read more

   As you grow older, it is very important to try to stay active. Physical
