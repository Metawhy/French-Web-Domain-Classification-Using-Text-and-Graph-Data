Website Disclaimer

   This website and its content are developed jointly by several parties.
   It provides information to the general public, and to victims in
   particular, on ransomware. It serves as an interface between victims
   and suppliers of tools and solutions for unblocking and/or decryption
   of a victim's files. You need to know that:
     * The “No more ransom” website contains links to other websites.
       These are separate websites, developed, controlled and maintained
       by the suppliers of the ransomware unblocking or decryption tools.
       By clicking on a link and navigating on a separate website, you may
       agree to the terms and conditions of that (separate) website;
     * The inclusion of external links on this website does not imply
       endorsement of the products or services contained in them;
     * The “No more ransom” website is not used to collect your personal
       data. However, linked websites may be used for such purpose.
       Responsibility for the processing of your personal data is with the
       party to whom the website belongs. That party is also your first
       point of contact;
     * Europol – as one of the participants to the project – cannot and
       will not collect, process or store your personal data;
     * The information and advice published on this website is offered for
       general information purposes only and should not be considered as
       professional advice. It is provided “as is”, without being tailored
       to individual situations. We offer no guaranteed solution to the
       unblocking and/or decryption of your files and cannot accept any
       liability got the failing to do so;
     * All information with regard to the diagnostic software and/or
       decryption tool(s) available on the “No more ransom” website is
       supplied by the owner of the tool, who is also responsible and
       liable for the completeness, accuracy and reliability of that
       information. In case of question with regard to the tool or
       information with regard to the tool, please contact the party
       owning the tool directly;
     * Malware is a fast paced area of crime. While the “No more ransom”
       project aims to assist individuals with issues encountered, the
       decision about whether to make use of any diagnostic software or
       description tools is one taken at your own risk. Malware is
       designed to cause maximum disruption and the parties involved in
       setting up this website cannot under any circumstances accept
       liability for any loss of data or damage to property;
     * The parties take no responsibility for, and will not be liable for,
       the website being temporarily unavailable due to technical issues
       beyond our control;
     * The following names and logos belong exclusively to one of the
       parties and are protected under international law. Their
       unauthorised use is prohibited:
          + Europol name and logo
          + the EC3 name and logo
          + “de Politie” name and logo of the Dutch Police
          + McAfee Ireland Limited and Logo (McAfee)
     * This website uses cookies: Google Analytics is a simple,
       easy-to-use tool that helps website owners measure how users
       interact with website content. As a user navigates between web
       pages, Google Analytics provides website owners JavaScript tags
       (libraries) to record information about the page a user has seen,
       for example the URL of the page. The Google Analytics JavaScript
       libraries use HTTP Cookies to "remember" what a user has done on
       previous pages / interactions with the website. Google Analytics
       mainly uses first-party cookies to report on user interactions on
       Google Analytics customers’ websites. These cookies are used to
       store non-personally identifiable information. Browsers do not
       share first-party cookies across domains.
       For more information, please visit Google Analytics Privacy Policy.


   * The general advice is not to pay the ransom. By sending your money to
   cybercriminals you’ll only confirm that ransomware works,
   and there’s no guarantee you’ll get the decryption key you need in
   return.
