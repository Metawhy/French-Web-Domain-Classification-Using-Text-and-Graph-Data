Network Gaming Platform based on GGPO

   This project is a new online arcade gaming platform heavily based on
   GGPO. The goal is to enhance current features as well as add new
   community requests to improve the overall experience. It's very
   possible that new features are first created for Super Street Fighter
   II Turbo and later might be added for other games.

Game ROMs

   In order to play any game on FightCade, you will need to obtain the
   ROMs for the games you wish to play and go to "Locate ROMs folder" in
   the Settings menu to tell FightCade where you placed your game ROMs.

That's it!

   You don't need to open any ports on your router: FightCade uses a
   modern NAT traversal technique that allows to connect two players
   without having to forward ports, making the setup easier :-)

Frequently Asked Questions
     __________________________________________________________________

Is it possible to add <insert your favourite game here>?

   If the game is supported in the version of FBA bundled with FightCade
   then yes, otherwise no.

   If it is supported and you want it included in the next update, please
   send us a good savestate file for the game using a pull request or
   opening an issue to the savestates repository. Make sure the game works
   fine by playing it in the "Unsupported Games" room first.

Would you consider updating FBA to a newer version?

   Yes! Check the new Fightcade2 Beta.

   I would like to thank Tony Cannon (Ponder) and Tom Cannon (inkblot) for
   the original GGPO emulator and the innovative p2p protocol, which I
   have used as ground work for FightCade.

   FightCade wouldn't have been possible without the help from papasi, who
   did an amazing job developing pyqtggpo, the multi-platform GGPO client
   used as starting point for the FightCade client: Thanks Papasi!!!1one

   I'd also like to thank delatroy, hanasu, Kuroppi, Xgamerz and yogaboy,
   for their help beta testing FightCade in its early days, their ideas
   and support.

   Finally, a huge thanks to 3xcl4m4t10n for taking the time to redo all
   the FightCade savestates with standarized settings.
