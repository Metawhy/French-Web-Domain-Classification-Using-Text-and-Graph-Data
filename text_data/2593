Question of the day

   [IMG_20180403_172624_105.jpg]
   The question on my mind tonight is this - do people still blog?
   Seems I haven't for two years yet I just spent tonight reading past
   posts and I realized how much I miss having a canvas for my thoughts
   and creations.
   So do I blog again?  Do I share my voice?  Do I still have readers?
   I think yes!

Ornaments & Happy Mother's Day

   Just a quick check in.  I haven't been around much, like not at all.
   So, really quick
   Happy Mother's Day!
   And not just to the mom's that have kids, I wish every women out there
   that has every hugged, encouraged, uplifted or helped another human
   being a Happy Mother's Day, because really, you are mothers too.  We
   women are good at mothering when we show kindness and encouragement.
   Also, Just a reminder while I haven't done a lot of posts on here, my
   Etsy shop is still open.  We are heading into wedding season and I've
   been making a lot of these:
   [wedding_duo.jpg]
   And for my local peeps, I'm excited about this one, August can't come
   soon enough!
   [fbtemple1.jpg]
   [temple_duo.jpg]
   Front with Temple and back with name and date!
   I've also still be crafting up some bots.  Sorry for the photo, this
   was just shot with my phone.  I call him my They Might Be Giants bot as
   he has a "little bird house in his soul!"  This guy was given away as a
   gift but if you'd like a robot of your own, I do take custom orders
   through Etsy
   [birdbot.jpg]
   Hope you all have a great day!

The Love Season is Here - DIY Heart Necklaces!

   With February already here - well, I guess it's not really here, still
   a day away - I've been getting some emails and questions about my heart
   necklaces.  I normally create a new design each year and good news,
   I've got one in the works.  However, until I'm ready to share that
   tutorial, I'm re-posting some info on necklaces from years past.
   I've had a couple of emails from people finding the picture of the
   necklace on Pinterest but then couldn't find the tutorial to make it -
   to make it easier for you, I've included the link below for you.
   These necklaces can be pulled together pretty easily and without much
   expense.  Plus, you can get the kiddos involved.  My girls are getting
   too old for craft-dates with friends (I know, it's sad) but when they
   were a little younger, we invited a bunch of their friends over and we
   made these.  They were a hit!
   [heart_complete.jpg]
   Valentine Necklace Tutorial
   And, here are a few other necklaces I've made over the years.  I don't
   have tutorials but if you are visual person, you can probably figure
   them out.  You just need some Sculpey clay and jewelry supplies.
   [heart_collage.jpg]
   The Necklace in the top left corner is probably the least expensive and
   simplest to make.  Here are some visuals on how to make the heart.
   It's just a heart shaped out of clay and then carefully stamped with a
   texture pad.  And, once the heart is made, you just need to poke a hole
   in it and bake it.  Then add paint and glaze.
   [box_clayhearts.jpg]
   Here it is a little bigger and with more of the chain showing.
   [h1_1.jpg]
   And here's one more with a complete tutorial

   Enjoy!  And, Happy February!

Happiest of New Year to you!

   Well Hello there, and hello to 2016!
   It's been far too long since I've been here and just wanted to drop you
   a quick hello.  I'm still around.  Still crafting.  Just haven't been
   posting much.
   All is well, no complaints.  The new year rolled in nicely with
   memories carried over from a calm Christmas and quiet days at home.
   Just the way I like it.
   I do hope your holiday season was filled with happiness and joy as
   well.
   Because I've received some emails about the following, here are just a
   few quick things to catch you up to speed on:
   Ornaments:
   [ornaments.png]
   I know, Christmas just ended but I am still getting emails daily from
   people wanting to order.  Good news!  You can - I reopened the Etsy
   shop and you can start early in purchasing your 2016 Christmas
   ornaments.  I mean, after all, there are only 353 days til Christmas
   and you and I both know how quickly those days are going to pass.
   Plus, ordering now means you avoid the crazy rush that made me close
   the shop early in December.
   My Girls:
   [trio.jpg]
   Many of you have been reading this blog since it's beginning.  I've
   waxed and waned my way through almost 7 years of blog posts.  I admit,
   it was much easier to post when the girls were little and I didn't work
   but still, since you are still reading and some of you have asked for
   updates.  The girls are doing great!
   The twins don't look so much like twins anymore.  This past year they
   have really branched out in their own ways.  It's fun to see them
   become more individual as they work to define and create their own
   selves.  And Miss M, well, she's reached a new point in her life and
   besides the college adventure she is currently on she is looking at
   leaving the nest for good.  It's too soon to say but I am preparing
   myself both mentally and on my Pinterest boards to embrace this change
   and possible upcoming life event.
   Crafts:
   Yes, I'm still crafting. I didn't blog it but my two favorite projects
   are as follows
   [dress_trio.jpg]
   Bug was in a dinner theater for her school and needed a mid-evil
   looking dress.  Believe it of not, they are hard to find in stores in
   December so I took a dress we had on hand from Miss M's prom days and
   just did a super fast presto-chango.  Took in the sides, changed out
   the waist, added some trim and long sleeves.  Yes, you are seeing
   correctly, I used a paper towel to craft a quick pattern for the
   sleeve.  I tell you what, paper towels are good for all kinds of
   things.  And, in the end, it turned out pretty good.
   [tree%2Bduo.jpg]
   And, I also made trees for my mantle.  Just simple green felt cut into
   leave shapes for the one and then the other I just hand drew a tree
   shape and cut it out.  Next I hot glued the felt onto a Styrofoam cone.
   Nothing fancy or hard but it was fun.  I know Christmas is over but I
   might just have to make more and if I do I'll be more mindful and take
   pictures for a tutorial that I can share.
   So that's all I have to report.  Thank you so much to those of you that
   have emailed.  I'm not very good at staying on top of my inbox and I
   know I didn't reply to everyone but your emails matter and mean so
   much!  Thank You!
   Bring on 2016 and bring on the DIY projects and craft adventures!
   Smiles,
   Amy

Happiest of New Year to you!

   It's been far too long since I've been here and just wanted to drop you

Question of the day

   [IMG_20180403_172624_105.jpg]
   The question on my mind tonight is this - do people still blog?
   Seems I haven't for two years yet I just spent tonight reading past
   posts and I realized how much I miss having a canvas for my thoughts
   and creations.
   So do I blog again?  Do I share my voice?  Do I still have readers?
   I think yes!

Ornaments & Happy Mother's Day

   Just a quick check in.  I haven't been around much, like not at all.
   So, really quick
   Happy Mother's Day!
   And not just to the mom's that have kids, I wish every women out there
   that has every hugged, encouraged, uplifted or helped another human
   being a Happy Mother's Day, because really, you are mothers too.  We
   women are good at mothering when we show kindness and encouragement.
   Also, Just a reminder while I haven't done a lot of posts on here, my
   Etsy shop is still open.  We are heading into wedding season and I've
   been making a lot of these:
   [wedding_duo.jpg]
   And for my local peeps, I'm excited about this one, August can't come
   soon enough!
   [fbtemple1.jpg]
   [temple_duo.jpg]
   Front with Temple and back with name and date!
   I've also still be crafting up some bots.  Sorry for the photo, this
   was just shot with my phone.  I call him my They Might Be Giants bot as
   he has a "little bird house in his soul!"  This guy was given away as a
   gift but if you'd like a robot of your own, I do take custom orders
   through Etsy
   [birdbot.jpg]
   Hope you all have a great day!

The Love Season is Here - DIY Heart Necklaces!

   With February already here - well, I guess it's not really here, still
   a day away - I've been getting some emails and questions about my heart
   necklaces.  I normally create a new design each year and good news,
   I've got one in the works.  However, until I'm ready to share that
   tutorial, I'm re-posting some info on necklaces from years past.
   I've had a couple of emails from people finding the picture of the
   necklace on Pinterest but then couldn't find the tutorial to make it -
   to make it easier for you, I've included the link below for you.
   These necklaces can be pulled together pretty easily and without much
   expense.  Plus, you can get the kiddos involved.  My girls are getting
   too old for craft-dates with friends (I know, it's sad) but when they
   were a little younger, we invited a bunch of their friends over and we
   made these.  They were a hit!
   [heart_complete.jpg]
   Valentine Necklace Tutorial
   And, here are a few other necklaces I've made over the years.  I don't
   have tutorials but if you are visual person, you can probably figure
   them out.  You just need some Sculpey clay and jewelry supplies.
   [heart_collage.jpg]
   The Necklace in the top left corner is probably the least expensive and
   simplest to make.  Here are some visuals on how to make the heart.
   It's just a heart shaped out of clay and then carefully stamped with a
   texture pad.  And, once the heart is made, you just need to poke a hole
   in it and bake it.  Then add paint and glaze.
   [box_clayhearts.jpg]
   Here it is a little bigger and with more of the chain showing.
   [h1_1.jpg]
   And here's one more with a complete tutorial
   [duo_complete.jpg]
   Gear Heart Necklace Tutorial
   Enjoy!  And, Happy February!

Happiest of New Year to you!

   Well Hello there, and hello to 2016!
   It's been far too long since I've been here and just wanted to drop you
   a quick hello.  I'm still around.  Still crafting.  Just haven't been
   posting much.
   All is well, no complaints.  The new year rolled in nicely with
   memories carried over from a calm Christmas and quiet days at home.
   Just the way I like it.
   I do hope your holiday season was filled with happiness and joy as
   well.
   Because I've received some emails about the following, here are just a
   few quick things to catch you up to speed on:
   Ornaments:
   [ornaments.png]
   I know, Christmas just ended but I am still getting emails daily from
   people wanting to order.  Good news!  You can - I reopened the Etsy
   shop and you can start early in purchasing your 2016 Christmas
   ornaments.  I mean, after all, there are only 353 days til Christmas
   and you and I both know how quickly those days are going to pass.
   Plus, ordering now means you avoid the crazy rush that made me close
   the shop early in December.
   My Girls:
   [trio.jpg]
   Many of you have been reading this blog since it's beginning.  I've
   waxed and waned my way through almost 7 years of blog posts.  I admit,
   it was much easier to post when the girls were little and I didn't work
   but still, since you are still reading and some of you have asked for
   updates.  The girls are doing great!
   The twins don't look so much like twins anymore.  This past year they
   have really branched out in their own ways.  It's fun to see them
   become more individual as they work to define and create their own
   selves.  And Miss M, well, she's reached a new point in her life and
   besides the college adventure she is currently on she is looking at
   leaving the nest for good.  It's too soon to say but I am preparing
   myself both mentally and on my Pinterest boards to embrace this change
   and possible upcoming life event.
   Crafts:
   Yes, I'm still crafting. I didn't blog it but my two favorite projects
   are as follows
   [dress_trio.jpg]
   Bug was in a dinner theater for her school and needed a mid-evil
   looking dress.  Believe it of not, they are hard to find in stores in
   December so I took a dress we had on hand from Miss M's prom days and
   just did a super fast presto-chango.  Took in the sides, changed out
   the waist, added some trim and long sleeves.  Yes, you are seeing
   correctly, I used a paper towel to craft a quick pattern for the
   sleeve.  I tell you what, paper towels are good for all kinds of
   things.  And, in the end, it turned out pretty good.
   [tree%2Bduo.jpg]
   And, I also made trees for my mantle.  Just simple green felt cut into
   leave shapes for the one and then the other I just hand drew a tree
   shape and cut it out.  Next I hot glued the felt onto a Styrofoam cone.
   Nothing fancy or hard but it was fun.  I know Christmas is over but I
   might just have to make more and if I do I'll be more mindful and take
   pictures for a tutorial that I can share.
   So that's all I have to report.  Thank you so much to those of you that
   have emailed.  I'm not very good at staying on top of my inbox and I
   know I didn't reply to everyone but your emails matter and mean so
   much!  Thank You!
   Bring on 2016 and bring on the DIY projects and craft adventures!
   Smiles,
   Amy

Happiest of New Year to you!

   Well Hello there, and hello to 2016!
   It's been far too long since I've been here and just wanted to drop you
   a quick hello.  I'm still around.  Still crafting.  Just haven't been
   posting much.
   All is well, no complaints.  The new year rolled in nicely with
   memories carried over from a calm Christmas and quiet days at home.
   Just the way I like it.
   I do hope your holiday season was filled with happiness and joy as
   well.
   Because I've received some emails about the following, here are just a
   few quick things to catch you up to speed on:
   Ornaments:
   [ornaments.png]
   I know, Christmas just ended but I am still getting emails daily from
   people wanting to order.  Good news!  You can - I reopened the Etsy
   shop and you can start early in purchasing your 2016 Christmas
   ornaments.  I mean, after all, there are only 353 days til Christmas
   and you and I both know how quickly those days are going to pass.
   Plus, ordering now means you avoid the crazy rush that made me close
   the shop early in December.
   My Girls:
   [trio.jpg]
   Many of you have been reading this blog since it's beginning.  I've
   waxed and waned my way through almost 7 years of blog posts.  I admit,
   it was much easier to post when the girls were little and I didn't work
   but still, since you are still reading and some of you have asked for
   updates.  The girls are doing great!
   The twins don't look so much like twins anymore.  This past year they
   have really branched out in their own ways.  It's fun to see them
   become more individual as they work to define and create their own
   selves.  And Miss M, well, she's reached a new point in her life and
   besides the college adventure she is currently on she is looking at
   leaving the nest for good.  It's too soon to say but I am preparing
   myself both mentally and on my Pinterest boards to embrace this change
   and possible upcoming life event.
   Crafts:
   Yes, I'm still crafting. I didn't blog it but my two favorite projects
   are as follows
   [dress_trio.jpg]
   Bug was in a dinner theater for her school and needed a mid-evil
   looking dress.  Believe it of not, they are hard to find in stores in
   December so I took a dress we had on hand from Miss M's prom days and
   just did a super fast presto-chango.  Took in the sides, changed out
   the waist, added some trim and long sleeves.  Yes, you are seeing
   correctly, I used a paper towel to craft a quick pattern for the
   sleeve.  I tell you what, paper towels are good for all kinds of
   things.  And, in the end, it turned out pretty good.
   [tree%2Bduo.jpg]
   And, I also made trees for my mantle.  Just simple green felt cut into
   leave shapes for the one and then the other I just hand drew a tree
   shape and cut it out.  Next I hot glued the felt onto a Styrofoam cone.
   Nothing fancy or hard but it was fun.  I know Christmas is over but I
   might just have to make more and if I do I'll be more mindful and take
   pictures for a tutorial that I can share.
   So that's all I have to report.  Thank you so much to those of you that
   have emailed.  I'm not very good at staying on top of my inbox and I
   know I didn't reply to everyone but your emails matter and mean so
   much!  Thank You!
   Bring on 2016 and bring on the DIY projects and craft adventures!
   Smiles,
   Amy

Question of the day

   [IMG_20180403_172624_105.jpg]
   The question on my mind tonight is this - do people still blog?
   Seems I haven't for two years yet I just spent tonight reading past
   posts and I realized how much I miss having a canvas for my thoughts
   and creations.
   So do I blog again?  Do I share my voice?  Do I still have readers?
   I think yes!

Ornaments & Happy Mother's Day

   Just a quick check in.  I haven't been around much, like not at all.
   So, really quick
   Happy Mother's Day!
   And not just to the mom's that have kids, I wish every women out there
   that has every hugged, encouraged, uplifted or helped another human
   being a Happy Mother's Day, because really, you are mothers too.  We
   women are good at mothering when we show kindness and encouragement.
   Also, Just a reminder while I haven't done a lot of posts on here, my
   Etsy shop is still open.  We are heading into wedding season and I've
   been making a lot of these:
   [wedding_duo.jpg]
   And for my local peeps, I'm excited about this one, August can't come
   soon enough!
   [fbtemple1.jpg]
   [temple_duo.jpg]
   Front with Temple and back with name and date!
   I've also still be crafting up some bots.  Sorry for the photo, this
   was just shot with my phone.  I call him my They Might Be Giants bot as
   he has a "little bird house in his soul!"  This guy was given away as a
   gift but if you'd like a robot of your own, I do take custom orders
   through Etsy
   [birdbot.jpg]
   Hope you all have a great day!

The Love Season is Here - DIY Heart Necklaces!

   With February already here - well, I guess it's not really here, still
   a day away - I've been getting some emails and questions about my heart
   necklaces.  I normally create a new design each year and good news,
   I've got one in the works.  However, until I'm ready to share that
   tutorial, I'm re-posting some info on necklaces from years past.
   I've had a couple of emails from people finding the picture of the
   necklace on Pinterest but then couldn't find the tutorial to make it -
   to make it easier for you, I've included the link below for you.
   These necklaces can be pulled together pretty easily and without much
   expense.  Plus, you can get the kiddos involved.  My girls are getting
   too old for craft-dates with friends (I know, it's sad) but when they
   were a little younger, we invited a bunch of their friends over and we
   made these.  They were a hit!
   [heart_complete.jpg]
   Valentine Necklace Tutorial
   And, here are a few other necklaces I've made over the years.  I don't
   have tutorials but if you are visual person, you can probably figure
   them out.  You just need some Sculpey clay and jewelry supplies.
   [heart_collage.jpg]
   The Necklace in the top left corner is probably the least expensive and
   simplest to make.  Here are some visuals on how to make the heart.
   It's just a heart shaped out of clay and then carefully stamped with a
   texture pad.  And, once the heart is made, you just need to poke a hole
   in it and bake it.  Then add paint and glaze.
   [box_clayhearts.jpg]
   Here it is a little bigger and with more of the chain showing.
   [h1_1.jpg]
   And here's one more with a complete tutorial
   [duo_complete.jpg]
   Gear Heart Necklace Tutorial
   Enjoy!  And, Happy February!

Happiest of New Year to you!

   Well Hello there, and hello to 2016!
   It's been far too long since I've been here and just wanted to drop you
   a quick hello.  I'm still around.  Still crafting.  Just haven't been
   posting much.
   All is well, no complaints.  The new year rolled in nicely with
   memories carried over from a calm Christmas and quiet days at home.
   Just the way I like it.
   I do hope your holiday season was filled with happiness and joy as
   well.
   Because I've received some emails about the following, here are just a
   few quick things to catch you up to speed on:
   Ornaments:

   Bring on 2016 and bring on the DIY projects and craft adventures!
