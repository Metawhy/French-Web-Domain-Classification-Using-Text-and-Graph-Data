                                Education:
   Instructor at Marshall University 2012-2013
   Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
   2009-2012
   Ph.D. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los
   Angeles 2008

   Research Expand

   I am a vertebrate paleontologist and a functional morphologist that
   specializes in mammalian carnivores. I am interested in how we can
   examine ecology in both living species and in the fossil record using
   morphology. I am particularly interested in how climate change and the
   extinction events at the end of the Pleistocene (10,000 years ago) have
   affected the morphology and ecology of living and Pleistocene species.

   I am currently the lead investigator at Natural Trap Cave, where we are
   excavating Ice Age mammals each summer to determine the roles that
   climate change plays in both the morphology and genetics of the mammals
   found at this site. Additionally, we are using a microfaunal and pollen
   record to recreate Pleistocene climate in mid-latitude North America.

   I am also involved in several other projects related to Pleistocene
   mammals, including dire wolves and sabertooth cats of Rancho La Brea,
   and an investigation of a frozen Beringian wolf puppy from the Yukon in
   Canada.
