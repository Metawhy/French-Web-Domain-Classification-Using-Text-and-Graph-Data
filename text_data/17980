   any questions on this or how it affects you, please
   contact privacy@exponential.com.

   Exponential Interactive, Inc. (“Exponential”) is a technology-enabled
   media services company whose clients and customers (“Partners”) include
   both online advertisers (“Advertisers”) and digital content providers
   (“Digital Content Providers”). We deliver innovative products and
   services designed to:
     * enable Advertisers to better reach their target audiences; and
     * enable Digital Content Providers to support, grow and monetize
       their properties through the sale of advertisements.

   For a full description of our Services please see our website
   at www.exponential.com.

   At Exponential we believe that safe, secure and respectful practices
   regarding the use of consumer information are fundamental to our
   business success and to the growth and vitality of the Internet as a
   whole.

   Exponential is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative and
   adheres to the NAI Codes of Conduct. Exponential adheres to the
   European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles for
   Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA). Exponential is subject to the
   investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

   For more detail of Exponential’s current involvement in self-regulatory
   initiatives and other memberships, please consult our Partnerships
   page for the current status.

   This Privacy Policy is intended to provide consumers with clear and
   complete information about the consumer data we collect in connection
   with our Services and the way that data is stored and used by our
   company, our clients and partners.

   For information about our privacy practices as they relate to our
   exponential.com website, please refer to the Corporate Website section.

A Primer on Data Regulation

   As the regulations are in the process of changing, these are some
   useful things to know:
     * The General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law, taking effect
       from 25^th May 2018. It broadens the definition of personal data to
       include anything unique to an individual. It also restates the
       requirements to have a solid legal basis for processing personal
       data and being transparent to data subjects (i.e. people) about
       what processing is taking place.
     * Personal Data is therefore an EU term, including things like name,
       email address, but also unique cookie IDs and IP addresses
     * Personally-Identifiable Information (or PII) is a mainly US term,
       and includes name and email address, but does NOT include cookie
       IDs or IP address. (Note: this definition changes slightly for
       COPPA – see the separate section under Children’s Privacy below)
     * The ePrivacy Directive, as it is known, requires websites to obtain
       consent for any cookies or similar technologies that are placed on
       a user’s device.
     * There is an additional EU Regulation called the ePrivacy
       Regulation, which is expected to take effect in 2019-2020. Its
       effect is not considered in the policy below.

Information We Collect via our Services

   When you visit a site operated by one of our Partners, we collect the
   following data:
     * IP address (considered personal data under GDPR)
     * Cookie ID (considered personal data under GDPR)
     * User agent (not considered personal data, as it’s not unique to an
       individual)

   We will also log clickstream data related to the website URL, the ad
   you’ve seen, time of day, and the topics we’ve identified on the page.

   We may also combine data we have collected with behavioural topic
   information from selected third party companies, but we require those
   companies to be of good standing and comply with the same
   self-regulatory and legal practices that we do.

Our Cookie ID

   In Europe, we require Advertisers and Digital Content Providers with
   whom we work to include this cookie within their legally-required
   cookie consent mechanisms.

   Cookie Table 1

Legal Basis for Collecting the Data

   We’ve agreed with the majority of our Partners that they have a
   legitimate interest in either monetizing their site, or in building a
   relationship with their customers – and Exponential have a legitimate
   interest in assisting them in that goal. Please review the privacy
   policies of websites you visit to verify the legal basis in effect.

   We also work with Partners who may ask you for your consent to process
   data, and Exponential may be listed in the consent dialogue.

   Please send any questions on legal basis to privacy@exponential.com.

What do we do with the Data?

   By understanding what behaviours users display and which sites they
   visit and purchase on, we can try and show more relevant ads to users,
   improving the customer journey.

   We share the data with select companies to assist us in this goal. They
   fall into 3 categories:

   Type

   Data Controller or Processor?

   Companies

   Log storage, access

   Processor

   Google Cloud, AWS

   3^rd Party Data Provider

   Processor

   Oracle

   Exchange

   Processor

   Google AdX, AppNexus, Index Exchange

   We also use the data, both cookie and non-cookie, for non-targeting
   reasons such as frequency capping, fraud prevention, reporting
   statistics and billing, within the permissions of the NAI/DAA
   Principles and EDAA Framework.

Data Retention

   Our tracking cookies are programmed to expire in ninety days from the
   last time we encounter you, at which point the web browser will delete
   them automatically.

   Click stream data is stored in log files, which are retained in our
   systems for 13 months (typically 2 months for troubleshooting and a
   further 11 months in case of billing or traffic fraud queries).

Opting Out

   For those sites operating under Legitimate Interest, it is still
   possible to opt out of any tracking or data usage by visiting our own
   opt-out page at this location: http://exponential.com/privacy/opt-out/

   Or alternatively any of the schemes operated by:
     * Digital Advertising Alliance
     * Digital Advertising Alliance Canada
     * European Digital Advertising Alliance
     * Network Advertising Initiative

   These opt-out mechanisms all work by setting a cookie with the
   following value:

   Cookie Table 2

   If you don’t have cookies enabled, this and similar opt-out mechanisms
   won’t work. Opting out via cookie will prevent any further targeting,
   although where legally permitted to do so, we will still use IP address
   and user agent for the purposes of geo-targeting and frequency capping.

   For any sites employing a consent mechanism, it won’t be necessary to
   opt out.

Access to Your Data

   If you would like to review what data we may hold about you, please
   contact us at privacy@exponential.com and you will be guided through
   the process. Please note that the only personal data we retain is a
   cookie id and IP address. We do not retain accessible log information
   for more than 60 days.

EU-US Data Transfers

   Exponential complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set
   forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use,
   and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to
   the United States.  Exponential has certified to the Department of
   Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is
   any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy
   Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To
   learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
   certification, please visit privacyshield.gov.

   Exponential’s accountability for personal data it receives under the
   Privacy Shield and transfers to a third party is described in the
   Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Exponential remains
   responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third
   party agents or service providers that it engages to process the
   personal data on its behalf do so in a way that is inconsistent with
   the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Exponential proves that it is not
   responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Children’s Privacy

   Exponential is sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy. Hence, our
   services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. We don’t
   offer the targeting of advertising towards anyone under the age of 13.

   In accordance with COPPA, we do not work with websites known to us to
   be directed to children.

Healthcare Privacy

   Exponential allows advertisers to target users in certain
   health-related categories. A list of these categories may be found
   here.

Do Not Track

   At the time of writing, we do not take into account the setting of the
   Do Not Track field in browsers.

Information Security

   Exponential follows generally accepted industry standards to protect
   against unauthorized access to, destruction or disclosure of data. This
   includes undertaking physical, electronic and management activities to
   protect data integrity, access and use. Any data that is stored on our
   servers is treated as confidential and is not made generally available
   to the public.

   Our servers are protected by firewalls and are located in secure data
   facilities to further increase security. Please keep in mind, however,
   that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers no
   method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure and
   therefore we shall not be liable for any breach of security by an
   outside party.

Lawful Requests

   We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information
   you have disclosed to us in response to judicial process or court order
   or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection
   with an investigation of matters related to public safety, as permitted
   by law.

Transfer of Data upon Change of Control

   In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of
   the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset
   purchase or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all
   data that is in our possession or under our control to such acquiring
   party.

Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Our Corporate Website
or Correspondence

   You may also provide us with personally identifiable information (such
   as your name, email address, physical address or telephone number) when
   you elect to contact us about this Privacy Policy or any other
   customer-service related matter. We will only utilize such data for the
   purpose of responding to your inquiry. However, we do reserve the right
   to retain an archival record of all such correspondence.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

   We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy by posting
   an updated version on this page. The date on which the current Privacy
   Policy was posted will always be noted at the top of this page. Any
   change we make to our Privacy Policy will be made in compliance with
   applicable law.

Complaints & Correspondence

   In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Exponential commits
   to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal
   data.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our
   Privacy Shield policy should first contact Exponential
   via privacy@exponential.com or using the mailing address below.

   Exponential has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield
   complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located
   in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of
   your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to
   your satisfaction, please contact or
   visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information
   or to file a complaint.  The services of JAMS are provided at no cost
   to you. Complaining parties may also, in absence of a resolution by
   Exponential and JAMS, seek to engage in binding arbitration through the
   Privacy Shield Panel.

   Any other complaints regarding our privacy practices, or related
   questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed
   to privacy@exponential.com or mailed to:

David Lodge

Retail Engagement Director – The Media Store

“When it came to our digital marketing strategy, we needed an online video
solution to reach highly qualified audiences, ready to make a purchase,
allowing us to measure sales success. When our agency and Exponential came to
us with VDX, we jumped at the opportunity to be forward thinking in the
digital video industry and we are delighted with the ongoing sales outcomes
they deliver.”

Jeff Kahn

Sr. Manager, Digital Strategy, CDW

“Exponential remains one of PlusMedia’s preferred display partners for direct
response acquisition. Our campaigns are able to not only meet, but exceed
goals through Exponential’s precision targeting, rich media placements and
more. Further, they truly cater to the objectives of each individual client,
working strategically with our team with an absolute commitment to achieve
success. Highly recommended for any agency/advertiser looking to realize the
true potential of display media.”

Vice President, Media, PlusMedia

“Put simply, Exponential has a solid product to offer and a stellar account
management team to ensure everything goes smoothly. Whenever I have new
digital budget to spend, Exponential is the first place I look to put it. I’d
highly recommend trying them out as a partner, if you haven’t already.”
