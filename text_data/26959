Abstract

   Plastic waste pervades the global landscape. Although adverse impacts
   on both species and ecosystems have been documented, there are few
   observations of behavioral flexibility and adaptation in species,
   especially insects, to increasingly plastic‐rich environments. Here,
   two species of megachilid bee are described independently using
   different types of polyurethane and polyethylene plastics in place of
   natural materials to construct and close brood cells in nests
   containing successfully emerging brood. The plastics collected by each
   bee species resembled the natural materials usually sought; Megachile
   rotundata, which uses cut plant leaves, was found constructing brood
   cells out of cut pieces of polyethylene‐based plastic bags, and
   Megachile campanulae, which uses plant and tree resins, had brood cells
   constructed out of a polyurethane‐based exterior building sealant.
   Although perhaps incidentally collected, the novel use of plastics in
   the nests of bees could reflect ecologically adaptive traits necessary
   for survival in an increasingly human‐dominated environment.

Introduction

   Urbanization and other forms of human‐caused land use change can alter
   both the diversity and behavior of wild species (Slabbekoorn and Peet
   2003, Winfree et al. 2009). Flexibility in adapting to selective
   pressures exerted in these landscapes that are different from those
   arising in natural areas enables some species to persist over others
   (Yeh and Price 2004, Shochat et al. 2006). One trait potentially
   indicative of a successful urban species is the recognition and novel
   use of human made products to enhance foraging or nesting
   opportunities. With more novel material accumulating in the landscape
   the chance some will act as analogues to natural materials might result
   in their incidental, but successful use by animal species.

   Although not easily determined, novel uses of human made materials
   might result in an adaptive advantage, leading to more widespread use
   after multiple successful occurrences in a given population. Bowerbirds
   (Passeriformes: Ptilonorhynchidae) are one example that, in order to
   stand out during courtship, decorate nests with human‐made products of
   specific colors (Diamond 1986). Additionally, house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus) and house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) have been reported
   to use discarded nicotine‐laden cigarette butts in their nests that
   reduce ectoparasites (Suárez‐Rodríguez et al. 2012).

   One pervasive human‐made compound common in all landscapes is plastic
   waste. Plastics are made to be strong, durable, and cheap, and as such
   are discarded as trash once used but resistance to degradation causes
   their accumulation in the natural landscape (Barnes et al., 2009).
   Plastics concentrate in landfills but also disperse across large areas
   in all habitat types, persisting in some cases for decades.
   Microorganisms and fungi have been studied colonizing or consuming them
   (Mergaert and Swings 1996, Barratt et al. 2003), and both altricial
   (e.g., robins, sparrows, pigeons) and precocial (e.g., geese, swans)
   birds have been documented using plastics as materials in nest
   building. Few other examples of animals using plastics in place of
   natural nest‐building resources have been recorded and that by insects
   is almost non‐existent. One observation made over 50 years ago noted
   the stingless bee Tetragonula hockingsi Cockerell (Apidae: Meliponinae)
   collecting fresh house paint as it dried, presumably for use as nesting
   material (Medler 1966).

   The materials collected or secreted to construct brood cells and close
   a nest vary considerably by bee species. The majority of bees in the
   family Megachilidae collect materials from the landscape ranging from
   muds and small pebbles, to different plant leaves, stems, and resins
   (Michener 2007, Cane et al. 2007). One species in particular, Megachile
   (Eutricharaea) rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is
   known to bring back a plethora of different natural materials,
   including cut leaves and flower petals (Hobbs 1967, Mader et al. 2010).
   The bee is Eurasian in origin and introduced to our study region,
   arriving in North America some time in the mid‐1930s (Stephen and
   Torchio 1961, Cane 2003) and soon after managed as an alternative
   pollinator (Bohart 1972). Other megachilids, such as Megachile
   (Chelostomoides) campanulae (Robertson) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)
   collect plant resins in place of cut leaves (Krombein 1967). Unlike M.
   rotundata, this species is native to Southern Ontario (Sheffield et al.
   2011). In this paper, we describe the use of polyurethane and
   polyethylene‐based products as alternatives to natural plant‐based
   nesting materials by these two bee species. Megachile rotundata was
   discovered using pieces of polyethylene‐based plastic shopping bags and
   M. campanulae used a polyurethane‐based exterior house sealant. Both of
   these bees provision brood above ground in cavities such as holes in
   wood, or plant stems, or in pre‐excavated holes in anthropogenic
   structures such as fences, awnings, brick walls, and human‐made trap
   nests (Mader et al. 2010).

Methods

   Trap nests were set up in Toronto in 2012 for research investigating
   urban landscape factors influencing bee populations. See MacIvor et al.
   (2013) for methodological details. Cavity‐nesting bees use trap nests
   as alternatives to natural nesting locations where brood cell series
   are laid in a row, from the back of a pre‐excavated nesting hole to the
   front. These nesting galleries were opened, brood cells inspected, and
   larvae reared to adults individually in a walk‐in growth room where
   temperature (27°C) and humidity (70%) were controlled. It was during
   inspection of the nesting tubes we discovered non‐natural materials
   built into the nests of two different bee species.

   One brood cell series constructed by Megachile campanulae contained 7
   brood cells (#1–7 from back to front), two of which (#4, #5) was made
   of a whitish green material of a less‐gluey consistency than the
   natural nest material (Fig. 1). An FTIR spectroscopy analysis with a
   Bruker Hyperion 1000 infrared microscope attached to a Tensor 27 FTIR
   Spectrometer were used to examine the material and a natural resin
   reference sample. These were analyzed directly by spreading on a
   potassium chloride window then compared with other reference materials
   including polyurethane polymers. An elemental analysis was done in a
   Hitachi S‐4500 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope at 15 kv
   using a Quartz XOne x‐ray microanalysis system. The samples were
   analyzed directly, without any coating.

   from the M. campanulae natural nest resin and has similar
   characteristics to common polyurethane polymers. (iii) Energy
   dispersive x‐ray spectrum reading of the substance collected by M.
   campanulae as a nesting material substitute.

   A second cell series, constructed by Megachile rotundata, had 8 brood
   cells (#1–8 from back to front). Three of the cells were partially
   constructed with fragments of plastic bag, replacing on average 23% of
   the cut leaves in each cell. The first was cell #5 and 4 of 17 pieces
   were plastic, #6 had 3 of 15, and #7 had 4 of 16 (mean number of leaves
   in non‐plastic containing cells was 16). All pieces were of the same
   white glossy color and ‘plastic bag' consistency and thus presumably
   from the same source (Fig. 2).

Results and Discussion

   Of the two polyurethane‐based brood cells provisioned by Megachile
   campanulae, one (cell #4) was parasitized by the generalist brood
   parasite, Monodontomerus obscurus Westwood (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) (7
   individuals emerged [4 female, 3 male]), and a female M. campanulae
   emerged from the second (cell #5). This bee species is common
   throughout Toronto, occupying 13.8% of all sites in 2011 and 8.6% in
   2012 (polyurethane‐containing cells amounting to only 0.74% of all
   cells collected). The FTIR spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the
   unknown sample from the M. campanulae nest most closely resembled
   polyurethane polymers (Fig. 1). The X‐ray microanalysis further
   supported this by revealing that Calcium (Ca), Titanium (Ti), and Iron
   (Fe) were present in the material, each of these being common elements
   in polyurethane‐based sealants and caulking (3M Company 2012) (Fig.
   1C). Polyurethane‐based sealants are commonly applied to the exteriors
   of all forms of buildings. Resin providing plants and trees are also
   common in the city in forested areas, home gardens, and in municipal
   landscape design. Since natural resins were found in the nesting cell
   series both in behind and in front of the plastic material, the use of
   polyurethane‐based sealants might be incidental and not due to a lack
   of natural resin options.

   Megachile rotundata was the most common bee surveyed in trap nests in
   both sampling years. The bee occupied 18.0% of all sites in 2011 and
   19.9% of sites in 2012. Brood cells partially constructed with
   fragments of polyethylene‐based plastic bags represented 0.85% of all
   brood cells constructed. All were males and emerged successfully,
   parasite‐free. The mandibular teeth markings in the cuts along the
   plastic bag nesting fragments were noticeably coarser and less uniform
   than those made in leaves from the same brood cell (Fig. 2), suggesting
   the use of plastic bags represented an aberrant behavior. Dried juices
   and pulp created from the chewing of leaf pieces by megachilid bees
   contribute to them attaching together to form each cell (Trostle and
   Torchio 1994). This natural process was presumably lost when the
   plastic pieces were used as they did not adhere to the other leaf
   pieces that comprised the cells, and easily flaked off when inspecting
   the brood cell architecture. Furthermore, since plastic pieces were
   found in combination with leaves in brood cells, and found only near
   the end of the cell series, bee naivete does not appear to be the cause
   for the use of plastic. The fact that M. rotundata returned to
   collecting leaves to finish the brood cells after using plastic
   suggests that leaf nesting materials were not limiting. It is
   interesting to note that in both bee species, the type of plastic used
   structurally reflects the native nesting material, suggesting that
   nesting material structure is more important than chemical or other
   innate traits of the material.

   There may be some advantage in using plastic as a nesting material, as
   it might physically impede parasites infecting a recognized host.
   Stephen and Every (1970) noted that Megachile rotundata constructing
   cell series in plastic drinking straws were free of Monodontomerus
   parasitoids, which were unable to sting through the plastic wall;
   however up to 90% of brood were lost to mold because plastic inhibited
   diffusion of moisture. Certainly, polyurethane and polyethylene based
   plastics could also be a detriment to brood survival. Although this too
   was not evident in the study as all specimens survived to adulthood
   after artificial rearing in the lab, many other examples of plastics
   inhibiting essential functions including mobility, foraging, and
   respiration in other animals is documented (Barnes et al. 2009).

   Our understanding of how plastics spontaneous integrate into natural
   ecological processes will increase as more human‐made material and
   products build up in both urban and non‐urban landscapes. Even more so,
   as ecologists, naturalists, and all hobbyists having access to a camera
   and Internet can quickly disseminate unique observations, which can be
   used to both engage the public, and contribute to empirical research
   (Silvertown 2009). The extent to which human‐made products such as
   plastic become a fixed part of the landscape might act as a novel
   selective pressure further delineating urban‐adaptive and
   urban‐avoiding species and subpopulations.

Abstract

   Global loss of predators calls for increased conservation of these
   crucial ecosystem components. However, large predators can also
   threaten public safety and adversely affect economic activities,
   creating conflicts between different public interests. In the ocean,
   although many shark species are facing worldwide declines, recorded
   instances of unprovoked attacks by sharks on humans have been
   increasing, stirring public concern and generating radical policies
   such as culling. Here we show that despite increasing records of white
   shark (Carcharodon carcharias) attacks in California, the individual
   attack risk for ocean users has decreased by >91% over a 63‐year period
   (1950 to 2013). The decrease in risk could be explained by an
   undetected long‐term shark population decline and/or changes in
   behavior and spatial distribution of people and sharks, the latter
   possibly associated with the recovery of pinniped (Phocidae and
   Otariidae) populations. Promoting safer behaviors among human ocean
   users could prove orders of magnitude more effective than culling,
   while meeting the dual goal of improving public safety and conserving
   endangered marine predators.
