   To celebrate ten years since the release of The Raconteurs’ Consolers
   of the Lonely, Third Man Records is reissuing the noteworthy album as
   part of Vault Package #38. Pressed on copper foil vinyl, this is the

   from recent sessions that will ultimately result in a new Raconteurs
   album in 2019.

   This very special Vault will also include a 4″x4″ Copper and Black “R”
   Insignia embroidered patch for your rocker jean jacket and a set of
   four 2.5″ Brushed Silver stickers featuring art from Consolers of the
   Lonely.
