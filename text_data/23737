Learning Tree International Commercial Terms and Conditions

   View the GSA Terms and Conditions >>

   Learning Tree International limits the provision of its educational
   services to employees of corporations, partnerships and government
   organizations who are sponsored by their respective organizations. This
   agreement is between Learning Tree International and the employer.

GUARANTEE OF QUALITY

   Our Guarantee of Quality provides our customers with the opportunity to
   attend the course of their choice — and then pay only if 100% satisfied
   with the value of the course. If a customer sends us a written notice
   of dissatisfaction with a course within 60 days of the course start
   date, the customer will have the option of retaking the course at no
   charge, applying prepaid tuition fees against another course
   attendance, or receiving a full refund of any course tuition paid and
   cancellation of any unpaid invoices for that course. If a customer used
   a Training Passport, Training Voucher or a Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher for
   the course, we will not count the attendance against the Training
   Passport, Training Voucher or Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher used.

TERMS FOR PUBLIC COURSES

COURSE TUITION

   The course tuition is due and payable within thirty (30) days after the
   later of the invoice date or the start date of the course with the
   exception of On-Demand Courses for which tuition must be prepaid prior
   to attendance or the granting of customer access to the course. Any and
   all applicable taxes will be invoiced. In the case of Training
   Passports or Training Vouchers, the full fee for the Training Passport
   or Training Voucher Pack purchase is due within thirty (30) days after
   the later of the invoice date or the start date of the first course
   attended under that Training Passport or Training Voucher Pack
   purchase. In the case of the Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Program, payment
   for each Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher is due within thirty (30) days of the
   invoice date. The course tuition includes instruction; course
   materials; the use of software, computers and other technical hardware
   as appropriate to the course; and Learning Tree Certification
   Examinations. Learning Tree International also provides light
   refreshments during morning and afternoon breaks. The course tuition
   does not include sleeping rooms, meals, travel or any other expenses
   that may be incurred by our customer.

SUBSTITUTIONS PERMITTED

   We welcome the enrollment of a qualified substitute in an enrollee’s
   place, provided the customer notifies us in writing before the first
   day of the course (excludes PRINCE2®, ITIL®, COBIT®, MSP® and Change
   Management courses). 100% of any prepaid course tuition will be
   credited against the course tuition fee of the substitute. However, the
   substitute may not take advantage of any discount program for which he
   or she is not otherwise qualified. Training Passports are
   nontransferable and therefore are not eligible for substitution.
   Substitutions for On-Demand Courses are excluded.

ONSITE CANCELLATION POLICY

   If a customer needs to cancel or reschedule any event less than 16 days
   before the scheduled start of the event, the customer will be subject
   to a cancellation fee in the amount of 50% of the event fee. However,
   if the event is rescheduled to execute within ninety (90) days of the
   cancellation date, then a cancellation fee in the amount of 25% of the
   event fee will apply. Learning Tree will not impose any penalty if the
   customer notifies Learning Tree of the need to cancel or reschedule an
   event 16 days prior to the scheduled start date of the event. Any event
   cancelled or rescheduled that is non-standard in length, content,
   delivery method, etc., based on customer requirements and request, and
   the customer cancels the course, the customer will pay for all incurred
   customization fees, or performance costs associated with the event.

FLEXIBLE TRANSFER/CANCELLATION POLICY FOR PUBLIC COURSES

   If a customer would like to cancel or transfer their course, they must
   notify Learning Tree prior to two weeks before the start date of the
   course or within seven days of registration. If a customer transfers to
   another course prior to two weeks before the start date or within seven
   days of registration of the course in which originally enrolled, 100%
   of any prepaid course tuition will be applied toward the course tuition
   for the subsequent course. If a customer needs to cancel an enrollment
   two weeks prior to the start of the class or within seven days of
   registration, we will refund 100% of any prepaid course tuition for
   that enrollment. If a customer does need to transfer or cancel a course
   within two weeks of the start date of the course or after seven days
   from the date of registration, a fee equal to 50% of the price of the
   course will be assessed for any standard attendances. Attendances
   associated with a Learning Tree program such as (Passport, Voucher,
   etc.) will be assessed a $500 fee. Training Passports cannot be used
   after the expiration dates, and a course cancellation or transfer by
   the customer will not extend a Training Passport expiration date.

PREMIUM COURSES

   Learning Tree Premium Course is any course that includes 3rd party
   materials, exam vouchers, certifications, specialized instructors,
   special software licenses, or premium labs and course kits. A course
   could have one or all of these attributes to be considered a Premium
   Class. The cost to execute these courses are higher than our standard
   Public Courses. Learning Tree reserves the right to designate courses
   as Premium based on these or other high costs associated with executing
   these events.

ON-DEMAND COURSES

   Learning Tree On-Demand courses are self-paced learning solutions
   delivering modular training combined with hands-on practice labs that
   allows customers a greater level of flexibility based on their
   schedules, availability, and professional needs. Customers will be able
   to attend On-Demand Courses at their leisure as needed via My Learning
   Tree. Customers must prepay for On-Demand Courses prior to access being
   granted by Learning Tree. On-Demand Courses are not cancellable by the
   customer and are non-refundable.

LEARNING TREE COACHING

   Learning Tree Coaching is a program designed to “bridge the gap”
   between classroom training and the workplace. The coaching is done at
   the workplace as a one-day extension immediately following completion
   of a Learning Tree On-Site Course. The instructor helps course
   attendees put into practice the knowledge gained in the course to
   tackle real projects or assignments, as well as services to redefine
   job roles, update competencies and define additional skills gaps.

TRAINING PASSPORTS

   Training Passports (i) are nontransferable and can only be used to pay
   course tuition fees for the named holder and (ii) cannot be used to
   attend courses that are either in excess of the specified number of
   courses or which start more than 12 months after the start date of the
   first course attended under that 3-Course Training Passport, or which
   start more than 24 months after the start date of the first course
   attended under the 4-Course Training Passport. If a customer purchases
   a Training Passport and cancels prior to its expiration, we will refund
   100% of the difference between the price paid for the Training Passport
   and the sum of the standard full tuition for each of the courses the
   customer attended using that Training Passport. Learning Tree reserves
   the right to exclude certain courses from eligibility in the Passport
   Program.

TRAINING VOUCHERS PACKS

   Training Voucher Pack agreements are purchase arrangements that provide
   customers discounts that are based on the initial committed volume of
   the customer purchase. Training vouchers: (i) are transferable within
   an organization and can be used to pay for the attendance of any
   qualified course participant; (ii) cannot be used to attend courses
   that are in excess of the number of enrollments covered by that
   Training Voucher Pack purchase; (iii) cannot be used for courses that
   start later than the agreed to length of the agreement which begins at
   the start date of the first course attended under that Training Voucher
   Pack agreement; and (iv) once an agreement is executed, the training
   vouchers are not cancellable by the customer. At the end of the term of
   the Training Voucher Pack agreement, any unused or remaining value of
   the Training Voucher Pack up to 10% of the total value purchased under
   an agreement may be rolled over and available for use for an extended
   period conditional upon the customer purchasing a new Training Voucher
   Pack that is at least comparable in size to the original Training
   Voucher Pack. Learning Tree reserves the right to exclude certain
   courses from eligibility in the Voucher Program.

PAY-AS-YOU-LEARN VOUCHER PROGRAM

   Pay-As-You-Learn Vouchers are offered for Public Courses only in
   25-course packs or greater. A commitment to purchase a minimum number
   of 25 Pay-As-You-Learn Vouchers within a twelve (12) month period is
   required and must be confirmed in writing via a Purchase Order (PO) or
   equivalent. The agreement is for one (1) year renewable on an annual
   basis and the committed Pay-As-You-Learn Vouchers must be used within
   twelve (12) months from the start date of the first course attended
   under that Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Pack, otherwise pricing expires on
   the renewal date. The Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher is transferable and a
   qualified substitute will be allowed to attend in the enrollee’s place.
   This substitution can be made at any time prior to the first day of the
   course. Learning Tree reserves the right to exclude certain courses
   from eligibility in the Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Program.

BLENDED LEARNING PROGRAM

   The Blended Learning Programs provide access to a blend of training,
   support, and other 3rd party materials offered within a subscription
   period.  The subscription period and components associated with each
   program will vary based on the specific program being offered and
   selected for purchase. The agreement is on a subscription basis for
   each attendee, and purchases under the program are non-refundable.
   Once the subscription is paid in full, or a purchase order is accepted,
   the attendee can access all program components during the subscription
   period.  Designed to serve the needs of a single practitioner, the
   program and fee is not transferrable and no refund is provided for any
   program components not used during the subscription period.

PREMIUM TRAINING BUNDLE PROGRAM

   The Premium Training Bundle Program offers an additional level of
   enhanced access, including unlimited access to a multi-day course,
   additional training, support, and other 3rd party materials offered
   within a subscription period.  The subscription period and components
   associated with each program will vary based on the specific program
   being offered and selected for purchase. The agreement is on a
   subscription basis for each attendee, and purchases under the program
   are non-refundable.  Once the subscription is paid in full, or a
   purchase order is accepted, the attendee can access all program
   components during the subscription period.  Designed to serve the needs
   of a single practitioner, the program and fee is not transferrable and
   no refund is provided for any program components not used during the
   subscription period.

TERMS FOR ON-SITE COURSES

   The course tuition fee for On-Site Courses is due and payable within
   thirty (30) days after the later of the invoice date or the course
   start date. If a customer needs to cancel or reschedule any event less
   than 16 days before the scheduled start of the event, the customer will
   be subject to a cancellation fee in the amount of 50% of the event fee.
   However, if the event is rescheduled to execute within ninety (90) days
   of the cancellation date, then a cancellation fee in the amount of 25%
   of the event fee will apply. Learning Tree will not impose any penalty
   if the customer notifies Learning Tree of the need to cancel or
   reschedule an event 16 days prior to the scheduled start date of the
   event. Any event cancelled or rescheduled that is non-standard in
   length, content, delivery method, etc., based on customer requirements
   and request, and the customer cancels the course, the customer will pay
   for all incurred customization fees, or performance costs associated
   with the event.

   Conditions of the Room Rental Agreement executed prior to the start of
   the room rental.

   measures in effect at the course location.

   possible of any such change. If the customer is unable to revised
   location or date, we will credit 100% of any prepaid course tuition
   fees paid against a future course or, if requested, refund those fees.
   Changes in course locations, course dates or attend a course at the
   postponement of courses will not extend a Training Passport, Training
   Voucher Pack or Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Pack expiration date.

Quickly Implement Large
Process Changes

   Large process implementations require significant cultural changes that
   prove to be challenging for most organizations. Learning Tree advisors
   are subject matter experts and can develop a plan to accelerate the
   adoption of your implementation, and play a key role in training your
   workforce.

     "Learning Tree helped me with my SharePoint implementation. It was
     great to be able to take what I learned at course and apply it in my
     organization. And when I needed some additional assistance applying
     what I learned, my Instructor was there to help me. This service
     provided a great value for me and my organization."

     — D. Cook, SharePoint Farm Administrator/Service Desk
     Department of National Defense

     "We launched a vast staff training and certification program on the
     ITIL methodology. Certifying more than 30 employees over and
     eight-month period was extremely ambitious, but we won our gamble
     thanks to Learning Tree's dedicated team. We will most certainly
     call upon Learning Tree for any further challenges of this scale."

     — G. Criniere, Technical Director
     Getronics

     "With the help of Learning Tree's Expert Team Coaching, our
     Strategic Initiatives Team can now prepare effective business cases.
     The instructor's knowledge, professionalism and experience were on
     target, providing valuable insight and practical skills, which our
     team put to immediate and successful use."

     — C. Oakes, Strategic Initiative Manager
     Elliot Group

     "Learning Tree's courses have superior content, excellent
     instructors, and a smooth setup process. Plus, bringing Learning
     Tree to our facility reduces training costs — allowing us to provide
     more people with the training they need."

     — S. Kanastab, Training Coordinator
     Reuters

     "I can always count on Learning Tree to provide excellent course
     content with very knowledgeable instructors. My team and I have
     taken several Learning Tree courses together, which has been a huge
     benefit when we recall what we've learned.""

     — D. Gonzales, IT Specialist
     U.S. Federal Courts
