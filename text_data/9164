Enabling Optical Connectivity Everywhere

   Bandwidth-hungry multimedia and video, the Internet of Things, cloud
   services, big data – the list of things that gobble bandwidth at
   alarming rates is growing – as is the need for faster and faster ways
   to move all of this data over distances not achievable by copper-wired
   cabling. For demanding applications such as intra-data center
   interconnects, high-performance A/V interconnects and many more – fiber
   optics is the answer. Cosemi’s business model and technical proficiency
   allow us to provide the most technically capable optical solutions
   available in plug-and-play hybrid active optical cables (AOCs). Our
   high-quality, high-volume, high-performance products are connecting
   your industry with data communications and power delivery – in one
   singular active hybrid interconnect.

"Connecting" Your Industry

     * data center interconnect, pin photodiodes

Data Center Interconnect
       The use of high-speed optical interconnects into and within
       mega-scale data centers is more popular than ever before thanks to
       cloud computing and 100Gb/s becoming the standard for intra-data
       center network speeds. Cosemi’s 100G AOCs offer an excellent
       solution for rack-to-rack or within the rack for server-to-TOR
       interconnect.

     * data center interconnect, pin photodiodes

High Performance A/V Interconnect
       From 4K to 8K Ultra HD, video standards are advancing. Traditional
       copper connections can't handle the data and speed now involved in
       interconnecting players, projectors, cameras, and various display
       monitors and televisions. Cosemi’s AOC technology brings
       affordable, high-performance interconnects for all of the latest
       video standards.

Enabling Optical Connectivity Everywhere

   At Cosemi, we’re ushering in the next phase of optical interconnect
   proliferation in the form of hybrid, best-in-class active optical
   cables (AOCs). Using fiber optics, these AOCs bridge the breadth of
   popular electrical interfaces and connectors to the reality of today’s
   faster and longer interconnect requirements. Our patented hybrid AOCs
   connect servers to switches, 4K/8K displays to the source, as well as
   help complete the connection in many other applications like machine
   vision, AR/VR, and universal personal computing connectivity of the USB
   standard.

   Our knowledge of supply chain efficiency and deep technical capability
   in high-speed RF, optical packaging/coupling, and optical compound
   semiconductor design forms the foundation for all that we do. From
   industrial and commercial to B2B and consumer, Cosemi is taking optical
   connectivity beyond the traditional datacom and telecom markets.
   Cosemi’s vision to bring semiconductor packaging methodology to optical
   interconnect solutions is fundamental to driving solution economics and
   to our vision of enabling optical connectivity in all wired
   interconnects from data centers to enterprises, consumers and beyond.
