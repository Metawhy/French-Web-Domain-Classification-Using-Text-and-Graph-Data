11 Essential Marketing Strategies for Your eCommerce Business

   September 30, 2016April 5, 2019 Posted byMouseflow

   Whether your company is just starting up or has reached the point of
   maintaining a well-established customer base, it’s important to stay up
   to date with the most current marketing trends and techniques for your
   eCommerce business. Structuring and finally launching an eCommerce
   website is a milestone achievement for your brand. Therefore, it’s
   crucial to invest in an effective website structure and marketing
   strategy.

   If you’re interested in finding out the best tried-and-true methods, as
   well as the newest techniques of marketing for an eCommerce business,
   pay attention to the 11 tips below:

   11 Essential Marketing Strategies for Your eCommerce Business 11
   Essential Marketing Strategies for Your eCommerce Business

1. Produce Original Content

   The first step in setting up an eCommerce website is creating the
   content for it. Creating high-quality and original content will set you
   up for success because it will resonate with your customers in a way
   that makes them want to interact with you, purchase from you, and
   maintain a following.

   Be creative. Be original.

   Promoting original content is a great way to make a statement, strike a
   compelling idea, and make a mark on the user’s mind. There is a fine
   line between content that engages users and content that deters them.
   Why not take an extra step, put in a little effort, and create
   something that will be genuinely compelling?

2. Optimize your website layout

   After launching your e-commerce site, it’s important to test your
   website’s layout, language, and placement of conversion elements. When
   customers visit your website, you want to make sure it’s easy and
   simple to check out — that they feel naturally inclined to purchase
   your products and that it’s abundantly clear how to do so.

   You should test the language displayed on your landing and product
   pages, the language in your conversion elements, and even the strategic
   placement of icons and elements. One really nifty tool is Mouseflow — a
   free heatmap software that reveals valuable patterns in customer
   behavior on your website. One of their most popular heatmaps, the
   movement heatmap, reveals the most attractive parts of your website —
   based on visitor movement data to your website.

   With a color guide, Mouseflow will tell you where your customers spend
   the most time, and the least amount of time! If a specific area of your
   page receives more attention (in white), you should consider moving
   your conversion elements to those more attractive areas. Test it for a
   week and see how your conversions change. Mouseflow’s heatmaps can help
   improve your conversions, increase sales, and keep prospects
   interested. Mouseflow is truly one of your competitor’s best kept
   secrets — and they offer a free account, so there’s no cost to you.

3. Content Marketing

   Proper content marketing can attract more positive attention,
   interaction, and sustainable conversions in a way no other marketing
   method can. By creating and promoting original content, you are
   ensuring that your audience is receiving new information that matters
   to them on a continual basis.

   Brainstorm with your team to create a list of the different types of
   content you wish to create, such as blog posts, videos, and
   newsletters. Also, make sure you are utilizing your marketing budget by
   consulting with experts, outsourcing work when necessary, and investing
   in high-quality software, subscriptions, employees, and training for
   your team. You will also find that if you work with the right people,
   many of the things you’ve paid for in the past can be done internally.
   Create diversity within your team and listen to everyone’s ideas.

   We also suggest that you create content based on Pareto’s 80/20 rule,
   which means that your promotions should comprise of 80% informational
   content, and 20% promotional content. All of the content you publish
   should be relevant, interesting, and unique.

4. Social Media Marketing

   Social media marketing is a very powerful tool that allows you to
   communicate with your industry, customers, and market in a personal
   way. You can utilize social media to generate engagement and
   interaction, boost traffic to your website, and develop a larger base
   of customers. Utilizing different social media platforms for different
   purposes also creates a rich presence for your company that diversifies
   your abilities, efforts, and will ultimately help you cater to your
   customers’ needs in a way that grows your business over time.

   Maintaining a solid tone and personality of your company through social
   media is very important because consistency is what will create trust
   within your audience. In order to develop and maintain brand
   recognition and authority, make sure your outreach efforts are unified
   by ensuring your team is on the same page with your company’s
   communication style.

5. Email Marketing

   One of the most effective forms of reaching out to your customer base
   is through email marketing. Although you have to be very careful about
   the content within your emails and who is included in your outreach,
   the reason email marketing has been around for so long is because it
   works.

   In order to reach your audience most effectively, provide useful
   content within your emails.  Make them as personal as you can, offer
   valuable promotions, and use it as an opportunity to socialize. Open up
   about what your business is doing, any events you are attending, new
   features or products, and be transparent about your company. You want
   to relate to your customers on a level that gauges their interest and
   keeps them engaging with your emails.

   As always, make sure you are monitoring the analytics of your email
   marketing efforts. One great tool that can help you with this is
   the Google Analytics Dashboard, which is a free solution that gives you
   useful data about your email marketing efforts.

   You can also track users who entered your website from your email
   campaigns with the previously mentioned tool, Mouseflow. All you have
   to do is set a custom URL that users “visit” when entering your site,
   and their entry page will contain that unique URL. A great way of doing
   this is to append UTM variables to your URL.

   You can use Mouseflow filters or the search feature to find users whose
   sessions contained your custom URL. From here, you can save and export
   the list, perform analytics, and watch how they interacted on their
   site. You can also filter your heatmaps for this data to analyze how
   they engage with each page of your site, which elements they find most
   attractive, and more!

6. Search Engine Optimization

   One of the most important and manual methods of optimizing a successful
   eCommerce website is making sure it’s optimized for search engines.
   With today’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO) standards, it’s now more
   important than ever to make sure your website is constantly updated
   with rich and relevant content, promotes a good user experience (UX),
   and is optimized to be as error-free as possible.

   The content within your website should be rich, reliable, and provide
   information to the public that is useful and relevant to what they’re
   looking for. For example, if you have an eCommerce store selling
   camping supplies, it’s wise to provide detailed product information and
   possibly even host sections of your website that offer generous amounts
   of content that elaborates on the topics of camping, supplies, or
   related subjects. Using keywords within your content in a genuine way
   will also flag your website as a matching result in search engines when
   users are looking for something specific.

7. Pay-Per-Click Marketing

   There are three basic elements to any pay-per-click marketing campaign:
   the ad, the offer, and the landing page.

   All three must be in good harmony and synchronization if you want to
   maintain the interest of the lead. The landing page must be a
   continuation of your ad, delivering what was promised as the reward of
   clicking on the ad, in order to take the visitor through your
   conversion funnel. It must also be customized for keywords to appear
   somewhere near the top of search engine results.

   Keep the landing page free of distractions and unnecessary bells and
   whistles. Also, keep in mind that your landing page is the most
   appropriate place to boast your product benefits to the customer.

8. Optimize Your Marketing Efforts for Mobile Devices

   It is absolutely crucial to make sure your website is responsive to any
   user layout. Mobile users are starting to dominate the sea of internet
   use, and it’s important to accommodate their needs to provide a good
   user experience (UX) for everyone.

   People who visit your website do not want to be redirected to an app or
   web version of your website, they want the full-meal-deal. So, make
   sure you deliver what they are expecting and make the investment to
   enhance your website so that it’s fully responsive.

   You can also use mobile marketing techniques to target mobile users
   specifically. One of the most popular marketing trends is
   called geo-targeting, which advertises to mobile users based on their
   location. This technique enables you to reach out to customers who are
   within a specific distance of your business, and provide them with an
   incentive to stop by or make a purchase.

9. Target Wearable and VR Technology

   Targeting wearable and Virtual Reality (VR) technology is a trending
   technique that grabs users in a new and exciting way. People are still
   getting used to this technology, and are not yet overwhelmed by or
   habituated to advertisements.

   Your target audience for these mediums will be very refined, as these
   users are the part of the population that carries the latest technology
   at the palm of their hands at all times, keeps up to date with trends,
   and doesn’t mind dropping some extra cash for items they desire.
   Although creating campaigns that are designed for these technologies
   can be expensive, the right approach can be worth the initial
   investment because a filtered audience is more likely to convert.

10. Launch Stores on Multiple Platforms

   Consumers have become the power player in the eCommerce industry, which
   means your business needs to stand out in a unique way. Because of
   this, it’s more important than ever to customize your user experience
   (UX) to cater to the needs of your audience.

   Make your outreach efforts personal by taking the time to learn about
   your customers. People love it when they feel special, and if you make
   sure to add personal touches like addressing your prospects by name,
   sharing videos and pictures of your employees, and being transparent
   about your company processes and procedures, you will reap the benefits
   of a loyal customer base. All of this will add to the overall ‘face of
   the business’ and will hopefully make its way to the hearts of your
   customers.

11. Retargeting

   Customers who have already shown an interest in your website are more
   likely to make a later purchase. Retargeting is a technique that tracks
   customers who have visited your website and displays ads to them while
   they’re browsing the internet with the intent of getting them back on
   your website. When these visitors enter your website again, they are
   far more likely to make a purchase.

   To effectively manage a retargeting campaign, make sure your ads are as
   specific as possible. Was the customer looking at a specific product?
   Make sure the ads displayed to them are ads of that specific product
   and link to the page of the product. Just like with Search Engine
   Optimization (SEO) and Pay Per Click (PPC) marketing, it’s important to
   display the information the user is looking for the instant they click
   on your ad. If they click on an ad for hiking boots and are redirected
   to the home page of your camping website, they aren’t going to be
   thrilled. But, if they are directed to the exact hiking boots they were
   considering, or even had added to their cart, before leaving your
   website, they will be much more likely to continue with a purchase.

In Conclusion

   Staying current with the latest marketing trends and techniques is
   crucial for any successful eCommerce website. It’s important to deliver
   relevant, interesting and valuable content and products that truly
   suite the needs of your target market. Reach out to your customers in a
   variety of ways and make sure you are working with a team of experts
   with varying skill sets. If you listen to everyone’s ideas, you may
   find new ways of improving your current campaigns and outreach methods.
   And, as always, make sure you are monitoring your website analytics to
   examine trends, keep your website optimized, and track your results!

   With the right mix of marketing techniques, you can improve your
   conversion rate and attract sustainable business that will continue
   growing over time.

Feedback Campaigns: How to Identify Referral Sources

   June 12, 2017June 18, 2019 Posted byMouseflow

   Identifying the referral sources of your clientele (and regular
   visitors) can skyrocket the effectiveness of your product marketing
   campaigns. Who is your ideal client? Where do they come from? How are
   they referred to your product or website? How did they hear about you?
   Is it a friend telling them about you? Is it a Facebook or Twitter ad?
   Receiving this type of feedback allows your team to evaluate what’s
   working, what’s not, and make decisions to scale the proper campaigns.

   Feedback Campaigns: How to Identify Referral Sources Feedback
   Campaigns: How to Identify Referral Sources

   If you’ve never filled out a feedback campaign before, you can follow
   our simple guide here.

Example questions to ask:

   -How did you find out about *our product*?

   -If you used a search engine, what search words did you use to find us?

   -Would you tell your friends about us?

   -Is this the first time you’ve heard of *our product*?

   -Do you have any colleagues who know *our product*?

   -Which social media platform do you spend the most time on?

What to expect:

   Many Mouseflow clients run this specific genre of feedback campaign —
   and you’d be surprised to learn how open visitors are to sharing this
   information with you. As visitors begin to fill-out this feedback
   campaign, it’s important to relay this information to your sales and
   marketing teams. It’s critical to understand the browsing habits of
   your most qualified customers — and where your target customers spend
   the most time. If a specific referral source yields more qualified
   buyers, consider scaling marketing efforts in that niche environment.

SESSION REPLAY

Watch exactly how people use your site — including what frustrates them.

   Mouseflow tracks clicks, mouse movement, scrolls, forms, and more. It
   shows an anonymized recording of the activity from each visitor on your
   site - just like CCTV. Best of all, you can filter sessions to find
   ones with user frustration, errors, compatibility issues, and much
   more!

   This eliminates guesswork so you can take action sooner. And, it's
   fast, secure, mobile-friendly, and supports checkout, dynamic-content,
   or members-only pages.

HEATMAPS

Spot trends in activity that matter.

   Mouseflow provides heatmaps to anonymously summarize where people
   click/touch, move the mouse, scroll, pay attention, and are located. It
   shows key behaviors in a simple, easy-to-read format.

   This makes it easy to uncover what works - and what doesn't. And, it
   supports custom date ranges, mobile and responsive layouts, and A/B or
   split tests.
   JOIN FOR FREE

FUNNELS

Discover where visitors are leaking out.

   Mouseflow tracks activity from page-to-page on your site. It helps you
   analyze key journeys and processes (like checkout or sign up).

   Build reports to examine visitor behavior throughout a journey. You can
   also watch the sessions of visitors who drop out!
   JOIN FOR FREE

FORMS

Identify what helps or hurts conversions.

   Mouseflow monitors how visitors interact with forms. It measures
   drop-off, refills, blank submissions, errors, and more - for each
   relevant form field - and can be filtered in real time.

   This helps you uncover issues, improve usability, and increase
   conversions among different segments of visitors.
   JOIN FOR FREE

FEEDBACK

Let your visitors tell you what's wrong.

   Mouseflow makes it easy to jump into the minds of visitors. You can
   create custom, interactive surveys to target a specific audience in
   seconds.

   This provides valuable feedback when it matters most: as visitors are
   frustrated, experiencing issues, or in need of help.

   “Mouseflow is a good addition to the other analytical tools we use and
   a good alternative to similar offers. Compared to eye-tracking studies,
   Mouseflow is faster, cheaper, and much easier to apply to multiple
   analytical cases. Compared to other session replay tools, Mouseflow
   does everything we need without the feature bloat and higher costs. And
   Mouseflow’s customer support is always on time and on target.”

A Response to the Princeton Study About Session Replay Tools

   November 15, 2017June 18, 2019 Posted byMouseflow

   A few days ago, the University of Princeton published
   a study investigating the use of session replay tools. The study
   identified issues with many of our competitors’ tools and was picked up
   by several news outlets, some more prominent than others.

What It All Means

   This coverage stirred up debate and caused questions about the privacy
   implications of session replay technology. While we’re happy that the
   study directed no criticism at Mouseflow, we’d like to address some of
   the concerns anyway:

   We understand why being recorded might be worrying at first, but it’s
   important to know that we enforce contractual and technical measures to
   ensure that no personal data ends up in our hands. For us, session
   replay is a tool that can show you anonymized users’ interactions on
   your website. This is, of course, a great help in improving and
   optimizing a website.

   But, the tool is not intended to be a way to spy on individual users –
   or to save their personal data in any way. To put it simply: we don’t
   want to record personal data or have it touch our servers. We don’t use
   it and, quite frankly, our clients don’t need it. That’s why we
   explicitly prohibit our clients from recording personal data in
   our Terms of Use and require clients to take measures to prevent it
   from being tracked. We also highly recommend our clients to be
   transparent in their use of our service: telling users when and why
   they’re being recorded can help avoid these concerns in the first
   place.

   On our side, we put in a great deal of effort to minimize any personal
   data that is accidentally recorded and to line up with local privacy
   regulations. As an example, we block all German websites from recording
   keystrokes, as it goes against the German privacy laws (BDSG). We also
   ensure that we never record sensitive information like passwords,
   credit card numbers, and the like – for any users. We even go as far as
   blocking all form fields which have more than 3 digits in them. Does
   this exclude too much data? Maybe, but we’d rather err on the side of
   caution than do too little.

   Our efforts have been intensified recently due to the upcoming privacy
   legislation in Europe. The “General Data Privacy Regulation”, also
   known as GDPR, introduces a lot of changes to how personal data is
   handled. We already covered GDPR in a few blog posts, and will continue
   to keep you updated on our efforts on our GDPR and Security pages.

   To sum up: session replay and privacy aren’t polar opposites – in fact,
   when done right, the two can co-exist peacefully.

   Let us know your thoughts and contact us at support@mouseflow.com if
   you have any questions.
