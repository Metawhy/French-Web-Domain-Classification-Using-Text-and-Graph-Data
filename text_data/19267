People Can't Tell If This Fenty Model Is Real Or Fake

   Shudu is the sci-fi creation of photographer Cameron-James Wilson.

   We've become so accustomed to filters and false realities on Instagram
   that it can become difficult to tell what's even real anymore. We'd
   like to think we still have a firm grip on reality, but an Instagram
   model named Shudu has just thrown our entire universe for a loop.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Nov 20, 2017 at 10:09am PST

   Shudu is an Instagram model with flawless dark skin. Her feed is
   scattered with various editorial images accompanied by #melanin
   hashtags. She even was reposted on Fenty Beauty's Instagram account,
   wearing the lipstick shade Saw-C. Her beauty is so striking and
   unfathomably perfect that you almost don't want to believe it's real.
   The thing is, it's not‚Äîshe's 100 percent CGI.

   "Basically Shudu is my creation, she‚Äôs my art piece that I am working
   on at moment," London-based photographer Cameron-James Wilson told
   BAZAAR.com. "She is not a real model unfortunately, but she represents
   a lot of the real models of today. There‚Äôs a big kind of movement with
   dark skin models, so she represents them and is inspired by them."

   Wilson was hesitant to confirm or deny Shudu's existence when we spoke
   with him on the phone this morning. After all, half the fun of creating
   art this life-like is to make the viewer reconsider their definition of
   reality. Her intent is not to fool or trick anyone, he says, but rather
   to be a beacon of inspiring beauty and creativity.

   "I use a 3D modeling program. It‚Äôs like virtual photography, so once I
   create her, I can kind of pose her in certain ways," Wilson explained.
   "I am a photographer anyway, so it‚Äôs just a way of exploring my
   creativity when I‚Äôm not shooting." A single image, like the one seen on
   Fenty's Instagram, takes several days to create.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Aug 27, 2017 at 11:07am PDT

   Shudu's striking beauty was actually inspired by a Barbie doll, called
   Princess of South Africa. "Obviously some models like Duckie were
   definitely big inspirations for her as well," revealed the
   photographer, who has also shot models like Gigi Hadid and Devon
   Windsor. It's worth noting that Fenty Beauty, who worked with Duckie on
   the brand's launch, only reposted the image of Shudu. We reached out
   for comment about whether or not they know about the model's
   computer-generated image.

   The technology is undeniably cool, but does Wilson feel any heat for
   creating a black model versus just shooting with a real one? "As a
   photographer, I work with lots of different people all the time, real
   people that have inspired her. At the end of the day, it's a way for me
   to express my creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs not trying to replace anyone. It's only
   trying to add to the kind of movement that's out there," he clarified.
   "It's meant to be beautiful art which empowers people. It‚Äôs not trying
   to take away an opportunity from anyone or replace anyone. She‚Äôs trying
   to complement those people."

   Only a handful of people have turned his work into something negative,
   while most understand his intention, he said. "I am just a creative
   person, and to me she is what the most beautiful woman in the world
   would look like."

   Shudu isn't the only computer-generated model on Instagram. Miquela,
   known as @LilMiquela, has 560,000+ followers who follow along as she
   models new clothes, takes selfies, and sells merch.

   In an era where Facetuning and digitally-altered photos are the norm
   across social platforms, Wilson said he's simply bringing fantasy to
   reality.

   "We live in such a filtered world now, where real is becoming fake. I
   wanted to create something that is fantasy toward becoming more real,
   and bringing it completely the other way."

Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Officially Choose a Nanny for Baby Archie

   The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take on additional help as they prepare
   for a busy summer and fall tour.

   Frogmore Cottage is welcoming another new arrival. Prince Harry and
   Duchess Meghan have officially hired a nanny for baby Archie.

   Sources confirm to BAZAAR.com that the couple recently took on the
   extra pair of hands ahead of Harry‚Äôs busy summer schedule and Meghan
   planning a return to royal duties this fall.

   While the couple are hoping to keep personal details of the new staff
   member private, BAZAAR understands that the British-born female nanny
   is not permanently based at Frogmore Cottage or working weekends.

   ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless
   nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

   The additional support will come in particularly handy for the Sussexes
   when they tour Africa this October. Sources say it‚Äôs increasingly
   likely that Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will be joining them for the
   trip.

   Logistics for the overseas visit are still being ironed out, but if
   Archie joins, Prince Harry will take on a number of engagements by
   himself. Stops on the itinerary include Malawi, to focus on the
   expansion of his charity Sentebale, and Angola, where the government is
   about to provide $60 million to clear landmines from two national
   parks.

   Buckingham Palace won't release further details about the two-week trip
   until July, but engagements in Botswana and South Africa are also
   expected to be included on the schedule.

   Harry and Meghan‚Äôs new acquisition joins a long list of much-loved
   royal nannies. Norland College graduate Maria Borrallo was hired as a
   live-in member of staff by the Cambridges in 2014 and can often be
   spotted helping out during family events, including this year‚Äôs
   Trooping the Colour on June 8. Meanwhile, Prince Harry remains close to
   favorite childhood nanny Tiggy Pettifer, whom he proudly introduced to
   Meghan on a trip to Cardiff in January 2018.

   ‚ÄúFamily life could not be more perfect for [Harry and Meghan],‚Äù a close
   friend of the couple has told BAZAAR. ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they
   haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

     * Meghan Markle is launching a capsule collection of work apparel to
       benefit one of her royal patronages, the charity Smart Works, which
       provides support for unemployed women.
     * The collection will launch later this year, and one item will be
       donated for each item bought.
     * The Duchess of Sussex's collaborators on the collection include
       designer Misha Nonoo and U.K. department store Marks & Spencer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is on a roll with her fashionable projects
   this week. Days after revealing that she guest edited the September
   issue of British Vogue, Meghan has announced that she's launching a
   capsule collection of workwear to benefit her royal patronage Smart
   Works, a charity that benefits disadvantaged and unemployed women who
   are entering or returning to the workforce.

   Meghan broke the news in her British Vogue issue, according to royal
   reporter Omid Scobie. She recruited an impressive set of collaborators
   for the project: British department stores Marks & Spencer and John
   Lewis, the brand Jigsaw, and her close friend and fashion designer
   Misha Nonoo.

   The collection will launch later this year and will be sold on a
   "one-for-one basis," meaning an item is donated for each item
   purchased. "Not only does this allow us to be part of each other's
   story, it reminds us we are in it together," Meghan explained in the
   magazine.

     The collection, launching later this year, will sell on a
     one-for-one basis. ‚ÄúFor each item purchased by a customer, one is
     donated to charity,‚Äù Meghan writes in @BritishVogue. ‚ÄúNot only does
     this allow us to be part of each other‚Äôs story, it reminds us we are
     in it together.‚Äù
     ‚Äî Omid Scobie (@scobie) July 30, 2019

   The duchess became the royal patron of Smart Works in January and had a
   public engagement at the headquarters that month. During her visit, she
   helped style one woman for a job interview.

   Meghan said during her trip, "It's not just donating your clothes and
   seeing where they land, it's really being part of each other's success
   stories as women."

   Smart Works has grown quickly ever since Duchess Meghan became
   involved. In February, the organization helped 187 women in London,
   which is almost 50 percent more than it assisted in the same month last
   year. Considering the ever-persistent "Meghan effect," the phenomenon
   of an article of clothing selling out after the duchess wears it in
   public, we can only imagine the impact her upcoming collection will
   have on Smart Works.

   We've become so accustomed to filters and false realities on Instagram
   that it can become difficult to tell what's even real anymore. We'd
   like to think we still have a firm grip on reality, but an Instagram
   model named Shudu has just thrown our entire universe for a loop.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Nov 20, 2017 at 10:09am PST

   Shudu is an Instagram model with flawless dark skin. Her feed is
   scattered with various editorial images accompanied by #melanin
   hashtags. She even was reposted on Fenty Beauty's Instagram account,
   wearing the lipstick shade Saw-C. Her beauty is so striking and
   unfathomably perfect that you almost don't want to believe it's real.
   The thing is, it's not‚Äîshe's 100 percent CGI.

   "Basically Shudu is my creation, she‚Äôs my art piece that I am working
   on at moment," London-based photographer Cameron-James Wilson told
   BAZAAR.com. "She is not a real model unfortunately, but she represents
   a lot of the real models of today. There‚Äôs a big kind of movement with
   dark skin models, so she represents them and is inspired by them."

   Wilson was hesitant to confirm or deny Shudu's existence when we spoke
   with him on the phone this morning. After all, half the fun of creating
   art this life-like is to make the viewer reconsider their definition of
   reality. Her intent is not to fool or trick anyone, he says, but rather
   to be a beacon of inspiring beauty and creativity.

   "I use a 3D modeling program. It‚Äôs like virtual photography, so once I
   create her, I can kind of pose her in certain ways," Wilson explained.
   "I am a photographer anyway, so it‚Äôs just a way of exploring my
   creativity when I‚Äôm not shooting." A single image, like the one seen on
   Fenty's Instagram, takes several days to create.

   Shudu's striking beauty was actually inspired by a Barbie doll, called
   Princess of South Africa. "Obviously some models like Duckie were
   definitely big inspirations for her as well," revealed the
   photographer, who has also shot models like Gigi Hadid and Devon
   Windsor. It's worth noting that Fenty Beauty, who worked with Duckie on
   the brand's launch, only reposted the image of Shudu. We reached out
   for comment about whether or not they know about the model's
   computer-generated image.

   The technology is undeniably cool, but does Wilson feel any heat for
   creating a black model versus just shooting with a real one? "As a
   photographer, I work with lots of different people all the time, real
   people that have inspired her. At the end of the day, it's a way for me
   to express my creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs not trying to replace anyone. It's only
   trying to add to the kind of movement that's out there," he clarified.
   "It's meant to be beautiful art which empowers people. It‚Äôs not trying
   to take away an opportunity from anyone or replace anyone. She‚Äôs trying
   to complement those people."

   Only a handful of people have turned his work into something negative,
   while most understand his intention, he said. "I am just a creative
   person, and to me she is what the most beautiful woman in the world
   would look like."

   Shudu isn't the only computer-generated model on Instagram. Miquela,
   known as @LilMiquela, has 560,000+ followers who follow along as she
   models new clothes, takes selfies, and sells merch.

   In an era where Facetuning and digitally-altered photos are the norm
   across social platforms, Wilson said he's simply bringing fantasy to
   reality.

   "We live in such a filtered world now, where real is becoming fake. I
   wanted to create something that is fantasy toward becoming more real,
   and bringing it completely the other way."

Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Officially Choose a Nanny for Baby Archie

   The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take on additional help as they prepare
   for a busy summer and fall tour.

   Frogmore Cottage is welcoming another new arrival. Prince Harry and
   Duchess Meghan have officially hired a nanny for baby Archie.

   Sources confirm to BAZAAR.com that the couple recently took on the
   extra pair of hands ahead of Harry‚Äôs busy summer schedule and Meghan
   planning a return to royal duties this fall.

   While the couple are hoping to keep personal details of the new staff
   member private, BAZAAR understands that the British-born female nanny
   is not permanently based at Frogmore Cottage or working weekends.

   ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless
   nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

   The additional support will come in particularly handy for the Sussexes
   when they tour Africa this October. Sources say it‚Äôs increasingly
   likely that Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will be joining them for the
   trip.

   Logistics for the overseas visit are still being ironed out, but if
   Archie joins, Prince Harry will take on a number of engagements by
   himself. Stops on the itinerary include Malawi, to focus on the
   expansion of his charity Sentebale, and Angola, where the government is
   about to provide $60 million to clear landmines from two national
   parks.

   Buckingham Palace won't release further details about the two-week trip
   until July, but engagements in Botswana and South Africa are also
   expected to be included on the schedule.

   Harry and Meghan‚Äôs new acquisition joins a long list of much-loved
   royal nannies. Norland College graduate Maria Borrallo was hired as a
   live-in member of staff by the Cambridges in 2014 and can often be
   spotted helping out during family events, including this year‚Äôs
   Trooping the Colour on June 8. Meanwhile, Prince Harry remains close to
   favorite childhood nanny Tiggy Pettifer, whom he proudly introduced to
   Meghan on a trip to Cardiff in January 2018.

   ‚ÄúFamily life could not be more perfect for [Harry and Meghan],‚Äù a close
   friend of the couple has told BAZAAR. ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they
   haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

     * Meghan Markle is launching a capsule collection of work apparel to
       benefit one of her royal patronages, the charity Smart Works, which
       provides support for unemployed women.
     * The collection will launch later this year, and one item will be
       donated for each item bought.
     * The Duchess of Sussex's collaborators on the collection include
       designer Misha Nonoo and U.K. department store Marks & Spencer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is on a roll with her fashionable projects
   this week. Days after revealing that she guest edited the September
   issue of British Vogue, Meghan has announced that she's launching a
   capsule collection of workwear to benefit her royal patronage Smart
   Works, a charity that benefits disadvantaged and unemployed women who
   are entering or returning to the workforce.

   Meghan broke the news in her British Vogue issue, according to royal
   reporter Omid Scobie. She recruited an impressive set of collaborators
   for the project: British department stores Marks & Spencer and John
   Lewis, the brand Jigsaw, and her close friend and fashion designer
   Misha Nonoo.

   The collection will launch later this year and will be sold on a
   "one-for-one basis," meaning an item is donated for each item
   purchased. "Not only does this allow us to be part of each other's
   story, it reminds us we are in it together," Meghan explained in the
   magazine.

     The collection, launching later this year, will sell on a
     one-for-one basis. ‚ÄúFor each item purchased by a customer, one is
     donated to charity,‚Äù Meghan writes in @BritishVogue. ‚ÄúNot only does
     this allow us to be part of each other‚Äôs story, it reminds us we are
     in it together.‚Äù
     ‚Äî Omid Scobie (@scobie) July 30, 2019

   The duchess became the royal patron of Smart Works in January and had a
   public engagement at the headquarters that month. During her visit, she
   helped style one woman for a job interview.

   Meghan said during her trip, "It's not just donating your clothes and
   seeing where they land, it's really being part of each other's success
   stories as women."

   Smart Works has grown quickly ever since Duchess Meghan became
   involved. In February, the organization helped 187 women in London,
   which is almost 50 percent more than it assisted in the same month last
   year. Considering the ever-persistent "Meghan effect," the phenomenon
   of an article of clothing selling out after the duchess wears it in
   public, we can only imagine the impact her upcoming collection will
   have on Smart Works.

Kristen Stewart is looking ahead

   After being catapulted into global stardom as a teenager in The
   Twilight Saga, Kristen Stewart moved on to more challenging roles,
   winning acclaim for her performances in thought-provoking independent
   films. Now, as she returns to the mainstream with Charlie‚Äôs Angels, she
   opens up about her fluid sexuality, directorial debut and finding the
   freedom to be herself.
   By Sophie Elmhirst
   Sep 2, 2019

   Alexi Lubomirski

   In a vast downstairs ballroom in the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, I can
   hear Kristen Stewart before I see her, changing behind a patterned
   screen in a far corner. Her voice is distinctive ‚Äì that easy,
   low-rolling Californian accent, where all the words run together, and
   she sounds like nothing could surprise her.

   When she finally emerges to go and have her picture taken on a balcony
   with the Eiffel Tower rising up behind her, she is in perfect contrast
   to her delicate, gilded surroundings. Her hair is a black-blonde swipe
   across her forehead, and she‚Äôs wearing floor-length black velvet, a
   black bow at her throat, as befits her status as a Chanel ambassador.
   She walks past, a bold, swaggering walk, and smiles. "Yeah," she says,
   seeing my face. "It‚Äôs intense. It‚Äôs a lot of look."

   Soon enough, she‚Äôs back, and changed. Ripped jeans, white T-shirt, bare
   feet: her more natural state. We talk on a warm terrace, cross-legged
   on sofas. I don‚Äôt know why I expected her to be reticent or shy, but
   probably because that is how she is always assumed to be, or how she
   comes across in photographs, when her expression sometimes seems
   deadpan, reluctant to give anything away. Or perhaps it‚Äôs just how we
   all remember her from the Twilight years as the permanently tortured,
   lovesick Bella Swan. "I try to avoid the word 'awkward'," Stewart says,
   remembering that time. "I want to reclaim that word, because it‚Äôs been
   used too violently against me."

   Exclusive video: Life lessons with Kristen Stewart

   Today, Stewart is anything but awkward. She is relaxed, open, garrulous
   and expressive, arms gesticulating as she talks, her voice clear and
   confident. Take, for example, how she describes meeting Elizabeth Banks
   for the first time (Banks has directed Charlie‚Äôs Angels, which comes
   out in November, featuring Stewart as one of the leads). The pair
   happened to be at the same party at the Venice Film Festival a few
   years ago. Stewart was dancing, but a little self-conscious. "I just
   didn‚Äôt feel as solid as I do now," she says. Banks, by contrast, was
   having a ball. She came up to Stewart, told her she was a fan and asked
   if she was having a good time. "And then she said what would be the
   most annoying thing to hear from anyone else," says Stewart, "which
   was, 'You‚Äôve got to have fun with it.'" She grins at the memory. "I was
   like, 'No shit! I‚Äôm trying.'"

   This is how Stewart talks ‚Äì frank, candid, plenty of swearing. She
   seems both sure and totally unafraid of saying what she thinks. It‚Äôs as
   though something has fallen away: caution, certainly, but also a former
   antipathy towards the whole publicity game that has haunted her on a
   global scale ever since the extraordinary success of Twilight. "Every
   day I get older, life gets easier," she says, smiling broadly.

   Kristen Stewart on how Hollywood is failing women

   Stewart was only 18 when the first Twilight movie came out. As the
   child of a script supervisor (her mother) and a stage manager (her
   father), she‚Äôd spent time on sets growing up, and had been acting in
   films since she was 10 years old (her first was The Safety of Objects,
   quickly followed by Panic Room with Jodie Foster). But it was the
   Twilight franchise that made her internationally beloved. She and her
   co-star and then-boyfriend Robert Pattinson would sit in press
   conferences with an expression of traumatised horror on their faces.
   They refused to discuss their relationship, and in interviews there was
   often a sense of a wall going up, of shutters closing. Most of the
   time, Stewart looked like she wanted to run away.

   "When me and Rob were together, we did not have an example to go by,"
   she recalls. "So much was taken from us that, in trying to control one
   aspect, we were just like, 'No, we will never talk about it. Never.
   Because it‚Äôs ours.'"

   After the final Twilight film was released, Stewart‚Äôs departure from
   the mainstream was pronounced. She acted with Juliette Binoche in
   Clouds of Sils Maria, a role for which she was the first American
   actress to win a CeÃÅsar award. Her choices were varied and unexpected:
   she played a psychic in Personal Shopper and made a movie about falling
   in love in an emotionless society (Equals). Her career became, as she
   describes it, "the most random game of hopscotch". She chose to work
   with friends instead of big names and didn‚Äôt mind making what she calls
   "weird, risky mistakes".

   But now, in another twist, there‚Äôs Charlie‚Äôs Angels, her most
   mainstream movie for years. The internet lost its collective mind when
   the trailer came out ‚Äì Kristen Stewart, the ultimate cool girl, doing
   stunts, doing comedy. "I did Charlie‚Äôs [Angels] because I‚Äôm a huge fan
   of Liz Banks and I always felt she vouched for me," she explains. "I
   always felt, like, she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a freak." It was still an act
   of friendship, but one that allowed Stewart to show off her
   little-known goof ball side and exceptional fighting skills. When her
   friends watched the trailer, they told her: 'Dude, that‚Äôs you.
   Finally!'"

     "I never valued the fame thing as much as I valued the experiences I
     got to do while working"

   If the idea of Stewart as goofball seems unlikely, then be reassured:
   she can still be intense. Looking back on those early years, and the
   strange sensation of being an object of fascination in your teens,
   makes her reflective. There were plenty of aspects of her fame that she
   found daunting, but what confused her was the sense that her public
   felt they both knew her and owned her, and then were let down when she
   wasn‚Äôt who they presumed she was.

   It was as though she‚Äôd become a character, I suggest. "Totally," says
   Stewart."I‚Äôve tried to say this before, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever
   articulated it properly... but people get mad at you because you‚Äôre in
   such a grand position, so if you don‚Äôt hold that up, you don‚Äôt deserve
   it. I never valued the fame thing as much as I valued the experiences I
   got to do while working, and it perplexed me so much... Some people
   were like, 'You ungrateful asshole!' and I was like, ' Yeah,
   completely, I don‚Äôt want to be famous, I want to do my work!'"

   An ode to Kristen Stewart

   These days, Stewart has mellowed. She knows there will always be
   expectations, but she also knows that she doesn‚Äôt have to meet them.
   When she looks around at younger actors and how they handle their
   position ‚Äì the Instagram activism, the campaigning zeal, the ability to
   communicate directly and honestly with their fans ‚Äì she‚Äôs amazed. "They
   have this insane agency," she says. "And the confidence! That is
   baffling! I‚Äôm like, how are you so confident? You‚Äôre so young!"
   Sometimes, she‚Äôs sceptical: the virtue-signalling can be a little
   forced, a little on point. She names no names, obviously, but
   describes, tantalisingly, "a couple of people who are like real
   activists, really at the forefront of progress, and I‚Äôm like, 'You are
   a deplorable fraud! And all you really care about is people looking at
   you.'" As I said, she‚Äôs unafraid.

   But she‚Äôs grateful, too. It is partly thanks to the next generation,
   their openness and bravery, that she has found her voice, and no longer
   seems to care about the consequences of using it. "I used to sit in
   interviews and go, 'God, I wonder what they‚Äôre going to ask me,' but
   now ‚Äì literally ‚Äì you can ask me anything!" So I take her at her word,
   and enquire what it feels like to constantly discuss her sexuality, now
   that it seemed to have become a subject for open debate.

   "Well," she says, "I think I just wanted to enjoy my life. And that
   took precedence over protecting my life, because in protecting it, I
   was ruining it." In what way, I ask. "Like what, you can‚Äôt go outside
   with who you‚Äôre with? You can‚Äôt talk about it in an interview? I was
   informed by an old school mentality, which is ‚Äì you want to preserve
   your career and your success and your productivity, and there are
   people in the world who don‚Äôt like you, and they don‚Äôt like that you
   date girls, and they don‚Äôt like that you don‚Äôt identify as a quote
   unquote ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù, but you also don‚Äôt identify as a quote unquote
   ‚Äúheterosexual‚Äù. And people like to know stuff, so what the fuck are
   you?‚Äô

   Stewart‚Äôs realisation, which she credits the younger generation with
   giving her the confidence to stick to, was that she was not required to
   answer that question. She has no answer. She doesn‚Äôt identify as
   bisexual, she doesn‚Äôt identify as a lesbian, she doesn‚Äôt like labels.
   She‚Äôs a different person every day she wakes up and delighted by that.
   "I just think we‚Äôre all kind of getting to a place where ‚Äì I don‚Äôt
   know, evolution‚Äôs a weird thing ‚Äì we‚Äôre all becoming incredibly
   ambiguous," she explains. "And it‚Äôs this really gorgeous thing."

     "If you don‚Äôt go out holding your girlfriend‚Äôs hand in public, you
     might get a Marvel movie"

   She accepts that she has become a sort of standard-bearer for that
   ambiguity. But she doesn‚Äôt mind. If she can make the conversation about
   sexuality easier for anyone, she‚Äôs happy. She also couldn‚Äôt care less
   about the impact any of this might have on her career. In the past, she
   says, "I have fully been told, 'If you just like do yourself a favour,
   and don‚Äôt go out holding your girlfriend‚Äôs hand in public, you might
   get a Marvel movie.'" She looks almost amused at the memory. "I don‚Äôt
   want to work with people like that." Now, by contrast, people approach
   her, drawn to that undefined sexuality, wanting to make movies about
   it. Stewart shakes her head in mock despair. "Literally, life is a huge
   popularity contest."

   For the next couple of years ‚Äì whoever she happens to be dating‚Äì
   Stewart will be busier than ever. Back when she was a kid, on set with
   her parents, she told her mother she was going to be the youngest
   person ever to direct a feature film, and that she‚Äôd do it before she
   was 18. "Thankfully I did not do that," she says now. But it‚Äôs finally
   happening next year, as she approaches her 30th birthday. Just 40 pages
   into reading the memoir, The Chronology of Water, about a young swimmer
   dealing with addiction, she sent an email to its author Lidia
   Yuknavitch. "I was like, I will read your book until the day I die."
   recalls Stewart. She bought the rights, and has spent years writing the
   script, which she recently read aloud to Yuknavitch. "It was a really,
   really satisfying feast of an intimidating experience" says Stewart. "I
   like being intimidated, so that‚Äôs fine."

   The script isn‚Äôt finished ‚Äì she wants to keep it fluid, open to
   interpretation. She has a sense of how she wants to do it, but also
   understands what a responsibility it is, being in charge of a cast and
   crew. "I know how precious it is ‚ÄìI‚Äôve done it," she says. "I can‚Äôt
   wait to make sure that I don‚Äôt mess up anyone‚Äôs chance to be great."

   She can‚Äôt believe her luck: that she gets to spend hours, years,
   thinking and talking about her favourite book to make it into something
   new. And this is just the beginning, she hopes: there are half a dozen
   other projects she‚Äôs keen to make. In the meantime, she‚Äôs not going to
   stop acting. If anything, directing is just a natural extension of the
   process ‚Äì one that she hopes will make her a better actor. But there‚Äôs
   also an attraction, inevitably, for someone who has been the subject of
   a collective gaze for so long, in switching positions, going behind the
   camera. In her new state, feeling free and compulsively honest, perhaps
   it‚Äôs a more natural place to be.

   As she puts it, just before she pads back to the ballroom on her bare
   feet: "The thing that‚Äôs really igniting me is the idea of starting the
   ball rolling ‚Äì and not being the ball."

Grace Kelly's grandson Louis Ducruet married in Monaco this weekend

   And the bride wore three striking wedding looks

   Louis Ducruet, the grandson of Grace Kelly and Rainer III, Prince of
   Monaco, and the son of Princess St√©phanie of Monaco and Daniel Ducruet,
   married his longtime love, Marie Chevallier this weekend. The couple
   tied the knot during an extravagant two-day ceremony in Monaco.

   Ducruet and Chevallier's civil ceremony took place on Friday, followed
   by a relaxed reception. On Saturday, they had their traditional
   Catholic church ceremony and then hosted a party that evening.

   Naturally, the extensive celebrations required more than one bridal
   ensemble. In fact, Chevallier chose three very different looks for the
   special occasions.

   For the civil ceremony, Chevallier wore a white wide-legged jumpsuit by
   designer Rosa Clar√°, who shared pictures of the bride and the sketch on
   Instagram. The design was a silk crepe culotte jumpsuit with
   embroidered lace detail at the waist.

   Her second look was for the church wedding, for which she opted for
   something far more traditional. The bride turned to Atelier Boisanger
   for an intricate gown that took over 300 hours to create.

   Finally, the bride's most low-key look came on Saturday evening, when
   she wore a mullet-hemmed lace dress, also by Rosa Clar√°.

Downton Abbey's Allen Leech marries Jessica Blair Herman

   The two got married in California earlier this month

   EXCLUSIVE: Allen Leech shares his wedding to Jessica Blair Herman with
   HELLO! ‚ô•Ô∏è Read about the star-studded ceremony via the link in our bio
   and make sure you pick up the magazine tomorrow to see inside their
   special day üíïüíç üì∏: @corbingurkin

   A post shared by HELLO! Magazine (@hellomag) on Jan 13, 2019 at 12:33pm
   PST

   Allen Leech married Jessica Blair Herman in California on 5 January and
   has shared pictures for the first time. The Downton Abbey actor married
   actress Jessica Blair Herman on an estate in Santa Barbara with guests
   including Michelle Dockery, Dan Stevens and Rami Malek, who Leech acted
   alongside in Bohemian Rhapsody.

   When heavy rain prevented the string quartet from playing, former Glee
   stars Darren Criss and Lea Michele - who attended the wedding as guests
   - stepped in to sing.

   "Everyone rallied round, the weather only made the day more epic,"
   Allen told Hello! "Darren and Lea are such great people and great
   friends, and they said, 'Absolutely no problem' when we told them the
   situation. We grabbed a guitar and they ended up singing the music for
   our ceremony."

   The bride wore a strapless Monique Lhuillier gown with Yves Saint
   Laurent heels. "That moment of seeing Jessica, oh my God, it was
   magical. It will stay with me forever," said Allen.

   The actor will soon reprise his role as Tom Branson in the Downton
   Abbey film which is scheduled for release in September. Leech attended
   last night's Critics' Choice Awards, during which he and the cast of
   Bohemian Rhapsody presented the award for Best Supporting Actress to
   Regina Beale for If Beale Street Could Talk.
