   Every Saturday at the “Place du Mont Blanc” you can enjoy the Chamonix
   Town Saturday Market.  Shopping for local produce as well as items for
   the home and clothing, under the gaze of the fabulous mountains.  Here
   you can find all sorts of treats from local and regional producers,
   fresh fruits, seasonal vegetables, cheeses and charcuterie. Also, there
   are many craft stalls featuring artisan products, clothes and shoes.
   Like many markets, it is not just a commercial event, it gets highly
   social! The nearby bars and cafe’s bustle with activity.  This vibrant
   market square enjoys the hustle and bustle of people milling around,
   interacting with the local, friendly vendors, who are introducing their
   very own produce.  There are delicious eateries, with possibly some of
   the best crepes ever tasted! The market is divided between food produce
   and goods and garments and on a sunny morning, there is probably no
   better way to spend time getting to know this quaint French market
   town. In our experience it is best to get there early, as after 12:30
   it starts to close down.

   Chamonix Town Saturday Market

   For more info: +33 (0)4 50 53 11 13 Mairie de Chamonix Mont-Blanc.

   This large market covers the Place du Mont Blanc and sometimes runs
   along Rue Whymper as well.  Its is easy to find, but for orientation it
   is opposite the Hotel Alpina, just off the Sanglard sports roundabout,
   before the pedestrianised zone.

   It’s not far from the train station or if you are driving, there is a
   car park on the Place roundabout or free parking slightly further away
   at “Les Planards”.  To get around town with your shopping, use the free
   and easy “Le Mulet” – a free shuttle bus that takes you around and
   through the centralised streets from the South end of Les Praz to
   Chamonix Sud.

   So if you are in Chamonix on a Saturday, no trip is complete without
   visiting the market!

   are many craft stalls featuring artisan products, clothes and shoes.
   Like many markets, it is not just a commercial event, it gets highly
   social! The nearby bars and cafe’s bustle with activity.  This vibrant
   market square enjoys the hustle and bustle of people milling around,
   interacting with the local, friendly vendors, who are introducing their
   very own produce.  There are delicious eateries, with possibly some of
   the best crepes ever tasted! The market is divided between food produce
   and goods and garments and on a sunny morning, there is probably no
   better way to spend time getting to know this quaint French market
   town. In our experience it is best to get there early, as after 12:30
   it starts to close down.

   Chamonix Town Saturday Market

   For more info: +33 (0)4 50 53 11 13 Mairie de Chamonix Mont-Blanc.

   This large market covers the Place du Mont Blanc and sometimes runs
   along Rue Whymper as well.  Its is easy to find, but for orientation it
   is opposite the Hotel Alpina, just off the Sanglard sports roundabout,
   before the pedestrianised zone.

   It’s not far from the train station or if you are driving, there is a
   car park on the Place roundabout or free parking slightly further away
   at “Les Planards”.  To get around town with your shopping, use the free
   and easy “Le Mulet” – a free shuttle bus that takes you around and
   through the centralised streets from the South end of Les Praz to
   Chamonix Sud.

   So if you are in Chamonix on a Saturday, no trip is complete without
   visiting the market!
