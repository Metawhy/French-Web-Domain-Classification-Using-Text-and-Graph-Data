The Mixed Up Chameleon

   Today we read The Mixed-Up Chameleon by Eric Carle. Afterward, we made
   our very own chameleons with tongues that can catch our dinner!

"O" is for "Octopus"!

   Today we studied the letter "O" and made our own octopus! We used the
   same shape as our astronaut helmets ("A" is for the "Astronaut"), an
   blotter for the tentacles, and some glue to make it all stick. We left
   the tabs on the side so we could make our octopus swim and look 3D on
   the bulletin board!

"C" is for "Crab" (Hermit Crabs!)

   Today we read Eric Carle's Hermit Crab. After discussing the book and
   talking about the letter C and sequencing, we made ourselves into a
   hermit crab. We took special care to decorate our shell just like the
   hermit crab in the story.

"T" is for Tortoise

   After studying the letter "T" and reading the book, Clever Tortoise we
   got to make our own tortoises by stamping with bok choy! Using food
   waste to make something beautiful was a lot of fun! Bok choy prints
   make for great texture for our tortoises!

"A" is for "Astronaut"

   Today we studied the letter "A"! We talked about words that start with
   the letter "A" and then read the story about an Astronaut that traveled
   to space! Afterward, we made ourselves into Astronauts by making our
   own helmets for space!
   Our teacher came up with the shape by using our classroom clock and
   traced it! Make sure to leave tabs on the sides so that you can wear
   it!
