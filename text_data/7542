26 I/Os: 16 INPUTS & 10 OUTPUTS

   The CPU with 26 Digital and Analog I/Os can handle tons of small-scale
   applications and you can easily expand it for your medium-size
   projects, upgrading your product capabilities thanks to the Digital and
   Analog expansions that allows you to connect more sensors and other
   high-end inputs and outputs.
   Add up to 2 expansions to the CPU to get up to 46 I/OS.

   [inputs_outputs_image.jpg]

Configurable analog inputs

   The first Nano-PLC with up to 12 analog inputs that allows you to
   directly connect high-end industrial sensors and other signal as:
     * 4-20mA: for high-end industrial sensors for water treatment
     * LDR: direct connection of LDR light sensors (No converter required)
     * NTC: direct connection of NTC temperature probe (No converter
       required)
     * 0 to 10V: to control with direct voltage or potentiometers
     * VCC or Voltmeter: to monitor battery status or other power sources

   [AnalogInputs_image.jpg]

Digital inputs and configurable high-speed inputs

   4 of the 16 digital inputs can handle high-speed counting of up to 60
   KHz allowing you to connect
     * Rotary Encoders: for motor position control like in access control
       barriers, packaging machines
     * Counters and meters: for high-speed counting, water and gas flow
       metering, etc
     * Industrial Tachometer: to calculate the speed of industrial motors

   [DigitalInputs_image.jpg]

Digital outputs

   Control up to 10 different devices with the following output types:
     * 2 Relay Outputs of 6 Amps
     * 6 Relay Outputs of 8 Amps
     * 2 Static/SSR PWM Outputs for:

     * Analog actuators like valves and pumps control
     * Analog actuators via external converters from PWM to 0-10V or
       4-20mA
     * Motor speed control with AC and DC drives

   [DigitalOutputs_image.jpg]

Ethernet (modbus TCP/IP) communication

   The em4 embedded Ethernet communication allows you to create a complete
   and optimized distributed automation solution:

   Use em4 as a client to monitor and control up to 16 devices like HMIs,
   motor drives, smart sensors, power meters, logic controllers and even
   other em4s.

   Use em4 as a server to communicate with networks like SCADA or be
   controlled by HMIs and other PLCs. Either as a client or server, em4
   can fully interact with up to 7 other em4s using labeled names instead
   of IP addresses.

   Program and debug your application in the network.

   Control and monitor your application at a distance with Virtual
   Display. Learn More

   Send and receive event notifications and recorded datalogs via email.
   [Ethernet_image.jpg]

Modbus RTU communication

   Use Ethernet and Modus RTU at the same time!
   Connect with HMIs, motor drives, other controller and other devices via
   Modbus RTU while at the same time you keep everything connected to your
   Ethernet Network.

   This is possible due to Modbus RS485 Master and Slave interfaces:

Bluetooth communication

     * Get easy access to hard accessible panels by controlling and
       monitoring your em4 wirelessly and from a distance via the Crouzet
       Virtual Display.
     * Program and debug your software from a distance.
     * Download recorded datalogs to your PC, laptop and mobile devices.

Easiest to use and most intuitive software

     * Easiest and most intuitive visual programming software based on
       drag and drop function blocks (FBD).
     * Save time with the already pre-programmed application blocks like
       pump management, flow control, liquid level and many more.
     * With Crouzet Soft you can edit & program your em4 either at your
       desk with USB or remotly through Ethernet or Bluetooth, even if
       already installed in your application, no need to remove it or
       disconnect any wires.

Smart Design

   A PLC in a Logic Controller Body
     * Due to its modular shape, em4 can be also used in distribution or
       modular panels
     * You easily can use it as DIN Rail mount or convert it to Panel
       mount by sliding the screw tabs located in the back
     * You can remove the front cover of the product side to put your own
       tag for a better organized panel or even put your logo if your are
       an OEM
     * You can completely remove the label holder to see only the screen
       and control buttons on a modular panel
     * The interchangeable interfaces allows you to quickly add Bluetooth,
       Modbus RTU or USB capabilities.

   [SmartDesign_image.png]

Embedded screen & control buttons

   The screen and control buttons embedded to the CPU allow quick user
   access to parameters

   Screen:
   With the high-contrast LED screen you can choose between the black or
   whit background

   6 configurable buttons:
   Each button can be configured for a different function that allows to
   manually execute a specific action
