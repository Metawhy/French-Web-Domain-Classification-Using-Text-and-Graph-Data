One Dress | Two Ways

   October 2, 2019

   I ordered this (non-maternity) dress a few weeks ago in hopes that it
   would be a versatile piece to get me through the last two months of
   pregnancy. Since then, I've worn it several ways, including with casual
   sneakers and my new Paris Texas boots.

Weekend Notes

   September 27, 2019

   It's my birthday weekend (Saturday, the 28th - Libra season! ) and what
   I'm most looking forward to, is spending some time with close friends
   and family. I have a few dinners planned and if timing works out, we
   may even go and see Hustlers. I haven't been to the movies in ages, so
   hoping that ends up happening.

Meghan Donovan’s Perfect Day In NYC

   September 23, 2019

   For today’s installment of ‘My Perfect Day in NYC,’ I’m so excited to
   have Meghan from the Wit & Whimsy. I met Meghan, who now resides in
   Brooklyn Heights,  years ago, when Instagram wasn't even a thing and we
   solely just focused on our blogs! Till this day, Wit & Whimsy is one of
   the best blogs out there offering everything from detailed guides to
   Paris to diving into conversations like acupuncture and a wide variety
   of really honest and beautifully written, personal posts (like being
   single in your 30's and dealing with insecurities as a blogger).

Weekend Notes, Plans & Links.

   September 20, 2019

   The above photo was taken the night of the Save the Children's gala
   that I attended as a guest of Johnson & Johnson. I had such a hard time
   finding a dress that worked with my 7 month pregnant bump, but
   eventually, found one that I liked.

   that I attended as a guest of Johnson & Johnson. I had such a hard time
   finding a dress that worked with my 7 month pregnant bump, but
   eventually, found one that I liked.

   This weekend is a packed one. Tomorrow, I'm celebrating a friends big
   milestone birthday (40!) while Keith is taking Nate to a 5 year old
   birthday party. On Sunday, we're heading out to New Jersey to visit our
   friends and their newborn baby. Keith had off this past Thursday and
   Friday (today) so we're taking advantage of some solo time while Nate
   is at school. Yesterday, we went shopping, had a leisurely lunch and
   just enjoyed each others company before the baby arrives and things get
   crazy. Today, we're purging around the house and trying to get stuff
   cleaned as nesting mode has officially began.

   As always, continue reading for some great links from the week!

Every Closet Needs One: My Camel Coat Picks for 2019

   September 18, 2019

   Whenever I get asked the question "what are your closet essentials?" a
   camel coat is always on my personal must-have-list. Whether you're
   fair, dark, in between, there's a shade and a shape that can suit any
   skin and body type. The photos I've shared are coats that are
   (unfortunately) a few years old, but it just goes to show how they
   stand the test of time. While the ones I am wearing are no longer
   available, I've compiled similar options and my favorites in various
   price points.
