I am an Assistant Professor of Biology at Howard University. I have broad
interests in evolutionary and functional morphology of vertebrates. I
currently study the diversity and biomechanics of gill chambers in fishes.

I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University funded by an NSF
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to work in the Museum of
Comparative Zoology and in the Lauder Laboratory.  Prior to that, I was a
graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Willy Bemis in Department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Cornell University.  Check out
EEB's diversity recruitment event for URM undergraduates interested in
biology graduate school.
