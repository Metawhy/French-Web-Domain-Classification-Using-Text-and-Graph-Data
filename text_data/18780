   Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, which have an interesting and
   somewhat mysterious heritage, have been popular amongst the English
   nobility ever since the 1800s. Upon her arrival in 1882, Queen Victoria
   found 5,000 British residents who were already occupied planting
   gardens and building mansions. Overseas property investors will find a
   host of charming property for sale in Menton and Cap Martin which lies
   near the Italian border in the south of France. Removed from the hustle
   and bustle of the French Riviera, this area is still close enough to
   enjoy in the atmosphere of the Riviera when you’re in the mood. Classy
   and sophisticated, the neighboring towns boast fine French cuisine,
   unique historical sites and stunning Italian architecture.

   Picturesque and peaceful, suburban Menton property includes grand
   mansions with light-filled relaxation rooms and duplex apartments with
   terraces that overlook the sea. Plant orange and lemon trees in your
   garden, which will grow year-round thanks to the phenomenal weather,
   and visit the tropical Jardins Biovès one warm afternoon. Another
   must-visit spot is the Jean Cocteau Museum, along with his original
   gallery right nearby. The town hall’s event space also has frescoes by
   Cocteau that depict scenes of love and marriage, making it one of
   France’s most popular locations for weddings. Though there aren’t many
   beaches in the area, the promenade de mer has seaside restaurants,
   sunbeds and parasols.

   The coastal town of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin is located partway between
   Menton and Monaco. Quaint and romantic, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin has three
   distinct sections: the medieval village, with cobblestone streets,
   covered passageways and a 10^th century castle, sits above the coast on
   Mont Angel; the resort and town center, which is located right along
   the coast; and the peninsula of Cap Martin, where luxury villas can be
   found. Exclusive residential areas are home to prestigious Cap Martin
   property, including contemporary villas and high-end apartments.
   Features include open-plan kitchens, mezzanines with additional
   sleeping areas, lofts to be used as a game room or office, guest
   suites, high-tech automation systems, infinity pools, outbuildings,
   sunny gardens with exotic plants and balconies with views of the
   Mediterranean.
