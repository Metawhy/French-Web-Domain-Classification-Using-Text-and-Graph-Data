   32.5MP at 14 fps seems like a lot of throughput - I would have thought
   it would be a double Digic 8 or 8+ based on the performance of
   comparable cameras (i.e. M50) using the Digic 8. I wonder what that
   will mean for throughput potential of the next R bodies?

   Im hoping the M5 MkII is close too, I got the M5 recently and really
   like it but would love a couple of extra tweaks and happily eat the
   upgrade cost.

   I'll wait on the M5 or M50 updates to decide if it is worth paying
   money to replace my M50.

   So the M6II will soon be tied as Canon's fastest burst rate camera, and
   fastest in Raw burst? :sneaky:
   Certainly that's not comparing apples to apples (and a cheeky comment),
   but it does imply what could be possible in the future bodies.
   Interesting stuff

   Very interesting. Even more interesting than the 90D, mainly because I
   seem to be favoring the potential of the mirrorless.

   -5 EV AF sensitivity at f/1.4 matches the Sony A7S II sensitivity (-4EV
   @ f/2)
   I thought this one was supposed to come with a new DIGIC 8+ processor.

   As I posted a few minutes ago here
   (https://www.canonrumors.com/forum/index.php?threads/all-is-quiet-regar
   ding-the-eos-90d-and-eos-m6-mark-ii.37459/page-3#post-788146), I
   disagree.
   TL/DR: In my mind, the M6 (with the optional viewfinder) is the
   flagship.

   AF-ON button! Canon is being serious here. The combined AF/MF switch is
   an interesting addition.

   ...in a different thread, I wrote this:
   What I like about the M6 II (so far) as far as ergonomics are
   concerned:
   (1) In my hands, the ISO was too easily accidentally changed in the M6
   I. It looks like this has been changed.
   (2) In my hands, in certain specific usage patterns (i.e. dangling
   around my neck with a non-stock [much-smaller] strap...while mated to
   te 18-150 lens), the camera was able to turn itself on. There are
   threads on this at a couple of places on the 'net. It looks like this
   has been changed, too.
   (3) It looks like the focus position, when the viewfinder is attached,
   is more like the m5 in that you can move it around on the touchscreen
   with your fingers
   I will buy at least one.
   =====
   adding:
   (4) examining the video a bit more, the ergonomics, for me, are also
   improved in that exposure compensation is more like the M2 (and the S90
   and S95) than the M6. A big win, for me.

   Shut up and take my money. And a viewfinder is THE LAST THING i want to
   see on this. I buy into this camera due to its portability and stealth
   factor paired w/ the 22-2. I do NOT want this to be another bulbous
   consumer plastic blob with something as tacky as a viewfinder plopped
   on a compact low end camera. That's what my high end cameras are for.
   For me this is street stealth all the way. Besides the best viewfinder
   is often the back screen. it's like 10x bigger to start with... superb
   Canon!
   I do like the AF / MF switch. I'm an original M user since launch day
   of the original M, all the Ms after that. Huge M nerd. I hope this new
   M6II has increased sensor performance. All I really care about as I
   shoot singular stills. For action I have my XT3. Don't need the speed
   but it'll be nice to have.

   With the M6 II you must choose between viewfinder and external
   flash/accessory. I believe the M5 II might have additional differences,
   possibly a bit larger body with a full tilty-flippy display? The
   downward rotating LCD in the M5 I was not exactly convenient. If I were
   Canon, form factor/ergonomics is definitely how I'd differentiate the
   bodies.

   No mention of dual pixel AF. Maybe the sensor is sourced from Sony?
   They buy Sony sensors for Powershots so why not? No 4K crop, insane
   throughput, .. smells at least like Sony. Or Canon really developed
   something completely new and there were no rumors about it..

   No mention of IBIS, Dual Digic, Dual SD, or 4K60 per the previous
   rumor. Still a significant upgrade from my 70D.

   So what's the over/under on whether 4K is full sensor or not? I say
   not.

   Considering it's full sensor on the M6mkII, it'll likely also be full
   sensor on the 90D...? Just guessing.

   I'm betting full sensor. This screen capture shows 120 is cropped, but
   it doesn't say that for 4K (see the *2/*3):

   The M6 II has the same note in it's video. That doesn't sound like it's
   full sensor readout downscaled "4K".
   The M6 II doesn't have a note about a FOV crop for 120fps FHD. The RAW
   Burst shooting feature of the M6 II seems to be missing from the 90D
   also.

   For me the big remaining question is sensor architecture and DR. Since
   they're not touting new and improved sensor technology on these splash
   videos my guess is that it's the old sensor tech with a MP bump. Same
   DR, more or less, is the way it would seem... We'll see....
   These are very nice evolutionary upgrades, but I had hoped for kaikaku,
   not mere kaizen.

   Doesn't seem like a significant upgrade from my 80D. 4k60 no crop on
   APSC would finally out it in competition with the A6500 and GH9 not
   sure why they leave things like 4k60 and ibis out on a camera that's so
   far behind in tech today.

   This is how all new Canon cameras seem to start out these days. They
   look quite promising at first glance, but unfortunately the more you
   find out about the specific details the more your interest wanes. The
   G7X III is a perfect case in point.

   A snip from the 90D video. Does the statement "During viewfinder
   shooting (AF fixed/tracking)" mean that when looking through the
   optical viewfinder and shooting at the high rate of 10 fps the AF is
   fixed; as in you have no AF available when shooting stills at 10fps?
   Please tell me I am reading this incorrectly.

   I'd like to think that means AF fixed or tracking mode both gets 10 fps
   when using the viewfinder, which is not a new tech by any means.

   You can't do full sensor readout of a 32mp sensor and generate 4k
   frames without image processing. If they were grabbing 4k frames
   directly it would have to be from a crop. The note may therefore mean
   the opposite of what you imagine.

   I thought that too - 10FPS fixed and "normal" servo tracking, but not
   eye AF.

   You should read it as however is more restrictive / less useful to an

   And yet when people actually get to use Canon bodies, not just argue
   about spec sheets on the internet, they are almost universally
   considered great cameras and better than the sum of their parts.

   So why is the note not mentioned for FHD? The same thing you describe
   would be the case for FHD video, but there is no * in the video for
   those with that explanation.

   One mode might be 12bit instead of 14bit, like the M50 where single
   shot is 14bit, but faster modes are all 12bit.

   Different speed settings? Maybe for when you don't need 14 fps. I know
   that when my DSLR had 5+ fps (I forgot if it was the 40D or 50D), I
   always used the 3 fps setting in continuous shooting mode since the
   faster mode gave me too many pictures.

   Hope so. If it's true it's pretty nice. I also don't need and can't
   stand too high fps. But if they have 7 fps with tracking priority
   that's nice.
   On another note there's no 24fps and 60fps in full HD so the internet
   is gonna have a field day with this one.
   Edit: Yay UHS II

   Most cameras have settings for hi and low frame rates. On some you can
   customize the setting for the low frame rate. The extra frames per
   second (above high) come with a trade off, e.g. my 1D X is 12 fps, or
   14 fps with mirror lockup shooting jpg. In this case, it’s probably 7
   fps with focusing between each frame, or 14 fps with the focus locked
   at the first frame.

   After seeing this, I think it's totally fake or Canon has some
   extremely incompetent employees writing it.
   The PD-E1 is mighty powerful for an LP-E17 battery....
   Not a single mention of 24p or any other frame rate options for video.
   Lots of typos...

   Good point, but in reality the whole list is filled with errors and
   typos. As I noted above, effective pixels exceed total pixels, and
   that’s plain wrong.

   No 24fps in either 1080 or 4k? Or are there perhaps just non-US specs?
   Seems rather odd

   Good point, but in reality the whole list is filled with errors and
   typos. As I noted above, effective pixels exceed total pixels, and
   that’s plain wrong.

   Yeah, there are some errors. On the other hand, 90D spec list appears
   to be accurate.

Canon is gearing up for a big 2020 [CR2]

   By Canon Rumors | September 30, 2019 | Canon DSLR Rumors

   We’re not going to see any more major product announcements from Canon
   in 2019, outside of the official announcement of the RF 70-200mm f/2.8L
   IS USM, which we expect in the next month or two, with the availability
   of the new lens coming in December.

   We have been told that Canon has a major announcement planned on or
   around February 11, 2020, which would come ahead of CP+, which begins
   at the end of February.

   A second source said “your readers should start getting excited for
   Photokina”, which is happening in May. Unfortunately, that was all we
   were told and we’ll have to wait a bit longer to find out what is
   possibly coming.

   We expect both the high-megapixel EOS R body and EOS-1D X Mark III to
   be announced in the first half of 2020, along with a lot of new RF
   mount lenses.

   Here is a short list of unreleased Canon gear from certification
   agencies

Here is a short list of unreleased Canon gear from certification agencies

   By Canon Rumors | September 26, 2019 | Canon DSLR Rumors

   Nokishita has posted known and unreleased Canon gear, for the moment
   the list is pretty short.

   Unreleased Canon gear:
     * DS586191 (DS586192 / DS586193 / DS586194)
     * Wireless file transmitter
          + Wi-Fi (IEEE802.11a / b / g / n / ac) compatible
     * Interchangeable lenses:
          + 3450C005AA (RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM)
          + 3792C005AA (RF 85mm f/1.2L DS USM)

   Some sites are stating that the DS586191 is the EOS-1D X Mark III, it
   is not. The EOS-1D X Mark III likely won’t have internal wifi
   capabilities, therefore wouldn’t need to get wifi certification.
   Secondly, Canon DSLR product codes begin with “DSC”, not “DS”.

   We have some more information coming soon to address new gear and when
   we can expect to see the next major announcements from Canon.

Canon has released firmware version 1.3.0 for the EOS RP

   By Canon Rumors | September 26, 2019 | Canon Firmware

   Alongside the new Canon EOS R firmware, Canon has also released a major
   update for the Canon EOS RP.

    1. Enhances the auto-focus (AF) eye detection to improve face and eye
       recognition at greater distances.
    2. Improved AF performance allows the camera to focus and track
       smaller subjects.
    3. Reduces the response time between the actual AF and the AF frame to
       display the image in the viewfinder or on the LCD monitor.
    4. Corrects a phenomenon in which the main dial icon is not displayed
       when pressing the zoom in / out button while the image is playing.
    5. Corrects the PTP communication vulnerability.

   Canon Cinema EOS C300 Mark III is the next cinema camera coming [CR2]

Canon Cinema EOS C300 Mark III is the next cinema camera coming [CR2]

   By Canon Rumors | September 24, 2019 | Canon Cinema EOS Rumors

   2019 has been a quiet year for Canon’s Cinema EOS lineup, with only the
   announcement of the long-awaited Cinema EOS C500 Mark II.

   We have been told that the next cinema camera from Canon will be the
   Cinema EOS C300 Mark III. However, the information we’ve received about
   this camera contradicts what we were told previously.

   The new information says the C300 Mark III will remain a 4K Super35
   camera, but with a more modular design like we see with the C500 Mark
   II. There will be no 8K version of the camera like previously reported
   according to this source.

   Now about 8K, a separate source claims that Canon will announce some
   kind of 8K offering in 2020, but that this camera will be “built to
   order” and not a retail consumer product.

   As for a follow-up to the Cinema EOS C100 Mark II, we have been told a
   few times that there will be no direct replacement for that camera.

   Patent: Canon RF mount modular CINE camera appears in drawings

Patent: Canon RF mount modular CINE camera appears in drawings

   By Canon Rumors | September 20, 2019 | Canon Patents

   An RF mount cinema camera of some kind is likely an inevitable
   evolution in Canon’s ecosystem when such a camera will appear is
   unknown at this time. I imagine the lens lineup needs to be a bit
   bigger before we see this sort of camera come to market.

   Canon News has uncovered a patent that shows such a camera in great
   detail. The patent itself is related to reducing the size of the forced
   air cooling smaller and more efficient, therefore reducing the size of
   the camera.

   As you’ll see below, the technical drawings for this camera are quite
   detailed. It shows a very modular camera design, it looks to be about
   the size of the XC series of cameras. We believe the Cinema EOS lineup
   will be moving to more modular designs as we’ve seen in the recent EOS
   C500 Mark II.

Patent: Canon RF 70-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM and more

   By Canon Rumors | September 20, 2019 | Canon Patents

   Canon News has uncovered a patent which details the optical formulas
   for a couple of super telephoto zooms, including an RF 70-400mm
   f/4.5-5.6L IS USM, a lens we’re told will appear sometime in the first
   half of 2020.

   In the same patent, Canon also mentions an RF 70-300mm f/4-5.6, a lens
   we could see appear as a non-L telephoto zoom.

     * Focal length:   72.00mm 146.00mm 290.00mm
