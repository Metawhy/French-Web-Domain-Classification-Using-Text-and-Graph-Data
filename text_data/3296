The in|situ| Lab

   The in|situ| project was created in 2002 as part of ``Inria Futurs''
   and has spun off multiple Inria research teams, including AVIS, ILDA,
   and LOKI, before officially ending after the maximum 12-year period for
   an Inria project team. The founding in|situ| team is now the ex)situ
   team at the Inria/Universit Paris-Saclay: https://ex-situ.lri.fr

   The in|situ| project develops novel interaction techniques as well as
   new tools to develop these techniques, and new methods to control the
   design process of interactive systems. The goal is to develop situated
   interfaces, i.e. interfaces that are adapted (or adaptable) to their
   contexts of use by taking advantage of the complementary aspects of
   humans and computers.
   In the long run, the project seeks to create a new generation of
   interactive environments as an alternative to the current generation of
   desktop environments.
