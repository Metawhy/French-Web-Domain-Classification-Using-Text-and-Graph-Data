2015 VMUG Leader Summit Recap

   Posted on December 5, 2015 by Marc Crawford
   1

   1204151149

   I had the honor of attending the VMUG Leader summit on Dec 2 – 4th.
   The summit was held at VMware HQ in Palo Alto.  There were 91 local
   VMUG leaders that attended the event.  Having so many VMUG leaders in
   one location was very valuable. I want to thank VMware VMUG HQ staff
   for coordinating the event and thank VMware for hosting this awesome
   event.

   The purpose of the summit was to share ideas and learn additional
   methods to enhancing local VMUG’s.

   There was a jam packed schedule of events.  I arrived Wednesday and
   there was a reception that evening.  It gave all the leaders a great
   opportunity to hang out and meet other leaders.

   On Thurs we had a jam packed day.  To start off the General Session
   Brad Tompkins (VMUG CEO) welcomed everyone and let us know what was
   going to happen that day. He also announced that VMUG will have a
   European office starting in 2016.  Next Mariano Maluf (VMUG Board
   President) talked about what was going on with the VMUG organization.
   Last, Guido Appenzeller (CTSO for NSXBU at VMware) gave a presentation
   on NSX.

   Next we were broken up into groups and attended different breakout
   sessions.  There were four different sessions that we attended
   throughout the day :
     * Architecting Your Leadership Group for Success
     * Deep Dive into Local Group Meetings
     * Virtually Everywhere – Getting Your Group Noticed
     * Integrating into the VMUG Community

   These sessions were designed to give us the tools and information to
   better run our local VMUG’s.  These sessions also initiated a lot of
   discussion about what worked and what was not working at each leaders
   local groups.  It was great to hear other leaders share their
   experiences.

   After two of the breakouts we had lunch and then Kit Colbert (VP & CTO
   of Cloud Native Apps at VMware) gave the afternoon keynote on Software
   Defined Everything.  It was really focused around DevOps.  Kit is a
   great speaker and did a great job presenting.

   After the Keynote we attended another breakout session.  After the
   breakout session was over, local group leaders who have a UserCon
   attended a session on “Making the Most of Your VMUG UserCon.”

   Surprisingly it was raining off & on Thursday, but we were given a tour
   of the Vmware campus after the UserCon session.  The VMware campus is
   huge and very beautiful.  VMware is a very green company, so everything
   was designed with that thought in mind. 1204151205b

   The campus tour was awesome, but we had one more breakout session to
   attend.  After that breakout session we walked across the VMware campus
   for a “VMware Demo Showcase”.  VMware engineers from different product
   groups had demos setup for us to watch and ask questions.  About half
   way through the Demo Showcase we had a huge surprise.  Pat Gelsinger
   stopped by with one of his good friends Michael Dell.  Michael talked
   for a few minutes and then him and Pat had to leave.  It was a
   highlight of the day for me. IMG_20151203_181230

   The Demo Showcase was great, but it was late in the day and I was
   tired, so after we went back to the hotel, I did not stay at the
   reception for very long.  There was a lot of food and drinks.

   Friday was only scheduled for half a day.  We had a great breakfast
   that morning – lots of BACON!  The morning was kicked off with a panel
   discussion from four VMUG leaders about what they had learned from the
   summit.  I was honored to have been asked to be on the panel.
   1204150835

   Pat Gelsiner returned Friday for the last General session.  He spoke
   about different VMware topics and then answered some questions from
   different leaders.

   The last keynote for the summit was presented by  Dr Don McMillian on
   “Effective Communication in the Information Age”.  I did not realize Dr
   McMillian was a comedian.  I do not remember the last time I laughed
   that hard.  He is extremely funny and if you ever have the opportunity
   to see him you will not be disappointed. .  You can check out some of
   his work at his website – http://www.technicallyfunny.com/

   Robin Matlock (CMO at Vmware) stopped by and spoke briefly about some
   marketing initives going on at VMware and then answered a few
   questions.

   Brad Tompkins closed the summit by inspiring all the leaders to take
   what we learned and apply it to our local groups.

   Overall, I thought the VMUG Leader Summit was a huge success.  I
   learned a lot from all the sessions and I learned even more from all
   the discussions going on between different leaders.

Bitdefender Gravityzone with vShield using Ravello

   Posted on August 20, 2015 by Marc Crawford
   Reply

   Being a VMware vExpert, I decided to use the free 1,000 CPU hours per
   month to run VMware ESXi labs or VMware workloads in AWS or Google
   cloud to test out the newest version of Bitdefender Gravityzone on
   VMware vSphere 6.  If you are not a VMware vExpert Ravello still
   provides a free trial period.

   Click Here to check out more information about Bitdefender and download
   a free trial.

   The first thing I did to get started was to add the Autolab 2.6 Final
   blueprint to my library and setup and application.  You can check out
   these links on how to setup Autolab on Ravello :
     * Autolab 2.6 Final in Repo
     * Walk through video of deploying AutoLab on Ravello
     * AutoLab on LabGuides.com
     * AutoLab 2.6 on Ravello – Setup

   Once you have Autolab setup on Ravello, your blueprint will look like
   this : rav02


   I did not want my DC & VC exposed publicly, so I removed public RDP
   access and added a WIN 7 VM as a jump box.  I also added three more
   ESXi hosts to my blueprint. blueprint


   Once the NAS, DC, VC & WIN701 VM’s were built, I modified the PXE boot
   menu so I could build more than 3 ESXi hosts.  You just have the modify
   the .cfg files in the TFTP-ROOT dir on the DC. menu


   After I had all the ESXi hosts were built and added to the cluster, it
   was time to install and setup VMware vShield since I was going to be
   testing agent-less AV.  This site has good instructions on where to
   download and how to install vShield.  Once you have vShield installed
   and endpoint installed on all the hosts, vShield should look like this.
   bd06


   Now that vShield is deployed and all setup it is now time to deploy
   Bitdefender Gravityzone.  You can learn more about Bitdefender and
   download a free trial from their website.  You can download the
   installation guide and follow it to install and setup Gravityzone.
   Once you have Gravityzone installed, then you can deploy the security
   appliances to each ESXi host.  In the picture below you can see I have
   the security appliance applied on each ESXi host and they have their
   own special icon. bd05


   After vShield and Bitdefender was installed, I installed a Windows 7 VM
   on one of the ESXi hosts.  It takes a little longer to install because
   it is nested on an ESXi host that is nested on Ravello, but it works.
   After Windows 7 is installed, I installed VMware Tools.  For agent-less
   AV to work, you need to enable Guest Introspection. introspection


   Now that everything is installed, it’s time to test it out.  You can go
   to the eicar website and download the eicar.com file.  I always save
   the file as eicar.txt.  I then open it and it should be blank. bd07


   Then you can log into Gravityzone and go to the dashboard.  It should
   show that it resolved an issue on one VM. bd08


   Bitdefender is a good solution for virtualized environments.  You can
   use vShield agentless solution and deploy security appliances on each
   host or you can deploy the Bitdefender agent on each VM and have one
   security appliance that all the scanning is offloaded to.

   Ravello made all this testing a lot easier since I did not have to
   setup any hardware, but my free 1000 hours did run out faster than I
   thought.  I will need to keep a closer eye on the number of hours I use
   each day.

   vmworld 2015

   VMworld 2015 is just around the corner.  This will be my 4th year
   attending.  It is not too late to sign up. Click here to sign up.

   There are a lot of posts out there with lots of tips, so I am going to
   list a few that I have not seen list.
    1. Do not use your work email address to sign up for VMworld.  Very
       difficult to get the email address associated with your account
       changed.
    2. Do things at VMworld that you can not do after VMworld is over
    3. Have Fun.  Don’t fill your day with attending sessions.
    4. Create a separate calendar just for VMworld schedule.  I used gmail
       and it is very easy to create a separate calendar that overlays on
       top of your regular calendar.

   Below is a collection of VMworld Conference Tips posts by some great
   bloggers.  Check them out.
