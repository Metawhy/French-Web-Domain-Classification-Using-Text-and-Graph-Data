   April 26, 2017john294 Leave a Comment

Ready to Optimize Your Bond Website for Google?

   If you want the internet site for your  company to rank top in search
   engines and you’re in a large metropolitan area, you may face stiff
   competition, but there are many ways to succeed despite. You may find
   that it’s easier to rank high for search terms such as “kitchen update”
   and “room addition” than it is for “general contractor.”  Or for an
   electrician, the focus may be on “house rewire” rather than
   “electrician.” The electrician mighty has the longer term goal of
   ranking high on “electrician,” however in the meantime, he can gain
   perceptibility for his website with less strain-over keywords. The
   strategy he needs is just creating “landing pages.”

   A California Contractor Bond company based out of San Diego has done a
   fantastic job of increasing their online exposure to you contracting
   company using the methods below…

How to Create More Leads

   1. Put your goals down on paper. You did this for your marketing plan,
   right? You need to take the same approach to your marketing efforts. If
   you don’t know where you are going, how do you know when you get there?

   2. Can you be found easily? Sure, you have a contact us page, but be
   sure and include your company name and address information on each
   page.

   3. Enlist the service of the local search engine listings like Yahoo
   Local, Google Local, Bing Local, Ask City, Yelp, and City search to
   name a few.

   4. Research your keywords. Think like a consumer, better yet, get
   consumer input. Too often we as business owners get tunnel vision and
   think we know what our customers are searching for. More often than
   not, they search in a manner that is contrary to what we would have
   expected.

   5. From the research above, pick about five of your most valued
   keywords for which you want to optimize your website.

   6. Analyze the completion for your selected keywords. Find out who
   holds the rankings of the first page of Google, and see what they are
   doing effectively to gain the search engine trust and occupy the
   coveted first ten slots.

   7. Create a list of the competition so you can track your progress
   against them. Then use Yahoo’s site explore to discover and analyze
   their backlink strategy.

   8. Make sure your site is indexed. Using the site command in Google,
   enter for search site:yourdomain.com to see what pages are indexed. If
   no pages are found you need to research why Google has not indexed your
   website.

   9. Engage the use of the search engine online webmaster tools. Google
   has Analytics and Webmaster Tools, and Bing has Webmaster Central.

   10. Set up Analytics and let it run for a couple of weeks to gather
   statistics about your website traffic.

   11. Evaluate your site design. Have you checked it for compatibility
   with all the major browsers like IE, Firefox, and Safari? Double check
   your HTML for onsite factors relating to SEO.

   12. Write a guest post on a construction related website about the
   contractor bond industry.

   This list should be enough to keep you busy for a while, but
   unfortunately, it only scratches the surface. There is more information
   than you can possible imagine about how to accomplish all these tasks,
   and the opinions of the best ways are endless. With contractor business
   SEO expert things can be much easier.

Best Practices For Marketing Your Contractor Bond Business Online

   April 1, 2017john294 Leave a Comment

   Many agencies practice online marketing. There are some tips that you
   can get from these professionals, which you can apply to your business.
   Especially when a business is new and funds are not enough to hire a
   professional, it’s beneficial to know how marketing experts think and
   work to achieve their goals.

Master Your Bond Products

   This may make you go, “Of course!” But very few business owners take
   this to heart, at least those who are struggling with their sales.
   Being an expert contractor bond California provider consists of
   mastering your product not only means knowing its parts and functions.
   You also have to know how in-demand your product is or how it can
   potentially become in-demand in the market.

   Writing articles about your product compels you to research more, and
   in effect, you learn even more about it. Plus, your articles become an
   additional source of information for your customers. When written well,
   your market views you as very credible and highly knowledgeable in what
   you do. Check out this great resource or here for more info on
   contractor bonds.

Know your customers

   Once you know your product like the back of your hand, it’s time to
   know your customers. It’s not as simple as knowing their names and
   birthdays. Knowing your customer is about finding out things like their
   lifestyle, their spending habits, and purchasing power. This will
   ensure your bond resources are able to connect on a personal level with
   your clientele.

   When you get into online marketing, reaching the right customers is
   easy if you know them well. For instance, you know your market is
   gadget people, so they check e-mails and everything else online through
   their phones or tablets like their iPad.

   Having this information, you will then format your email or ads in such
   a way that it will load right on mobile devices so your customers can
   read it the way you intended them to.

Keep customers engaged

   Keeping a customer interested in your business is much trickier than
   persuading one to try you out. Through online marketing, you can
   maintain a relationship with your clients and keep them engaged to your
   business.

   Social networking sites are just one of the many tools online that can
   help your customers stay engaged. Other marketing methods like online
   videos, e-mail marketing, and article writing keep your customers
   interested, too.

   Specialize on technique – It’s good for business owners to concentrate
   and specialize on one online marketing technique first. When you have
   too many methods at once, you just have way too many results to track,
   and all other things you have to think about. Focusing on just one
   helps you become more equipped in that area. Once you’ve got that all
   set-up, working, and generating results, you can move on to another
   online marketing tool.

Picking the Right Social Media Platform to Promote Your Business

   February 4, 2017john294 Leave a Comment

   Social media is now a fact of life and it is here to stay.  There are
   multiple platforms you can use to promote brand awareness and you can’t
   afford to let this opportunity pass you by.  However with so many
   different social networks to work with, do you set up a profile on all
   of them?  No, you pick and choose the ones that will work for you.
   Social media is an investment in your time if you want it to work for
   you, too many profiles will take too much time for too little reward.

   You need to find the social networks that work for you.  Where are your
   ideal customers hanging out.  Professionals will be found on LinkedIn
   while millennials are more likely to be found on Snapchat or
   Instagram.  If you’re still not sure which platforms you should be on,
   here is a little help.

Where is Your Competition?

   You look at the websites of your competition and find out where they
   are sharing content.  What platforms is there content being shared on,
   how many followers do they have.  If they are getting a ton of shares
   on Facebook then your business needs to be there too.

Do You Know Your Market?

   You need to have a firm definition of what your ideal client is.  How
   old are they?  Where are they located?  What do they do for a living?
   Once you have the demographics down you have a head start on where to
   look.  Facebook and Twitter tend to be common to all, while
   professionals will be found on LinkedIn, and younger audiences will
   trend more towards Snapchat or Instagram.  If your business is depended
   on visuals, such as interior design, fashion or the food industry then
   Instagram and Pinterest are better choices.

   Here is a video showing you how to figure out who your ideal customer
   is.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVWjXwWlKsk

What Does Your Audience Want?

   Do they want information, trivia or games?  You may have to do some
   testing to find out what your audience wants to see online.  Determine
   what will give you the best response and engagement and give it to
   them.

Manage Your Time

   Social media can be a huge time suck if you let it, so don’t.  There
   are tools you can use like Hootsuite to help automate posting, and take
   advantage of them.  You can make posts for days or even weeks in
   advance depending on how keen you are.  Make the most of the channels
   you choose and post content regularly.  Be prepared to adapt your
   strategy and remember all of these social media channels all have
   advertising platforms that can help boost your brand.

Your Business Can’t Grow Without Online Marketing

   February 1, 2017john294 Leave a Comment

   If you run a business then you may be aware of online marketing but you
   may not understand the value of it or what it can do for your
   business.  If you marketing efforts have always been in the “offline”
   world then you’re being left behind.  The truth is your business can’t
   grow without online marketing.  Here are some of the differences and
   advantages of developing an online marketing plan.

Wider coverage

   Traditional marketing, for example the 30-second commercial, only
   reaches a certain number of people within a defined locale, while
   online marketing covers a far wider scope. This global coverage usually
   helps the business to reach more audiences, which may ultimately lead
   to better results, more relevant leads, and higher conversion rate.

Speed

   Everything happens in real-time online. You can post real-time videos
   on different platforms of things happening in your business right now.
   You can connect with people immediately in the online world, that just
   isn’t the same offline.

Audience engagement

   In traditional marketing, communication is usually one-way. The
   business is seen on TV or heard over the radio and that’s about it. As
   an advertiser, you would want to get feedback from your customers right
   away, thereby improving the quality of your ads as well as your
   products. Online marketing makes this possible quicker, cheaper, and
   faster.

Affordable costs

   The budget that you will spend on your marketing campaign is much
   smaller, this is the main advantage of the internet marketing. A
   commercial on a radio or TV will cost you a vast fortune. Each
   marketing campaign will cost some money, but online marketing costs
   much less and you can see even bigger results. The web offers options
   for marketing that are so laser targeted to your ideal customer that
   nothing else really compares.

Receive feedback

   The traffic online is huge, but you still can track your customers and
   receive the feedback about your service or products you provide. They
   can leave the questions, requests and with some additional tool you
   even can gather the statistics about your audience.  Online marketing
   is really interactive, there is a great option to receive an honest
   feedback about the promo campaign that you have.

   You will receive a full range of comments, positive and negative, but
   this gives you the knowledge to change and advertise more effectively.
   Keep in touch with your active customers who are looking for your
   certain products or offered services by knowing very well their
   demands.  Online marketing is still really in its infancy but if you
   want your business to grow then you need to embrace what it can offer
   you.
