MathJax

Beautiful math in all browsers

   A JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers.
   No more setup for readers. It just works.

Features and Benefits

High-quality typography

   MathJax™ uses CSS with web fonts or SVG, instead of bitmap images or
   Flash, so equations scale with surrounding text at all zoom levels.
   View Samples

Modular Input & Output

   MathJax is highly modular on input and output. Use MathML, TeX, and
   ASCIImath as input and produce HTML+CSS, SVG, or MathML as output.

Accessible & reusable

   MathJax works with screenreaders & provides expression zoom and
   interactive exploration. You also can copy equations into Office,
   LaTeX, wikis, and other software.

Samples

   Our homepage is configured to use MathJax's CommonHTML mode with web
   fonts to display the equations, which produces uniform layout and
   typesetting across browsers. But MathJax can also be configured to use
   HTML-CSS (for legacy browsers), SVG, and native MathML rendering when
   available in a browser. You can try the various output modes using the
   MathJax context Menu (which you access by ctrl+clicking / alt-clicking
   / right-clicking an equation) or the menu below.

   Select the rendering mode:   [CommonHTML]

The Quadratic Formula

   \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

Cauchy's Integral Formula

   \[f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz\]

Double angle formula for Cosines

   \[ \cos(θ+φ)=\cos(θ)\cos(φ)−\sin(θ)\sin(φ) \]

Gauss' Divergence Theorem

   \[ \int_D ({\nabla\cdot} F)dV=\int_{\partial D} F\cdot ndS \]

Curl of a Vector Field

   \[ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y}
   - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i} + \left(
   \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}
   \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} -
   \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k} \]

Standard Deviation

   \[\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2} \]

Definition of Christoffel Symbols

   \[(\nabla_X Y)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k = X^i \left( \frac{\partial
   Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma_{im}^k Y^m \right)\]

Live Demo

   Type text in the box below. Include some math: enter MathML as MathML
   tags, and wrap TeX in $...$ or $$...$$ delimiters (or \(...\) and
   \[...\]), and AsciiMath in `...` delimiters. The text you enter is
   actually HTML, so you can include tags if you want; but this also means
   you have to be careful how you use less-than signs, ampersands, and
   other HTML special characters within your math (surrounding them by
   spaces should be sufficient).

   When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c =
   $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$___________________

Accessibility and reuse.

Accessibility

   MathJax provides a powerful set of accessibility extensions that
   provide navigation, exploration, and voicing on the client.

   You can find more information in our introductory video on YouTube and
   our documentation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Reuse

   Using the MathJax context menu, you can access the source of any
   mathematical expression either in MathML format, or in its original
   format if that was TeX or AsciiMath.

   To access the MathJax menu, right-click on a math formula (if you are
   using Windows), or Control-click it (if you are using a Mac) or
   touble-tap and hold on a touch device. In the sub-menu “Show Math as”
   you can choose between “MathML Code” and “TeX commands” to get a pop-up
   that allows you to copy the math source into another application. Try
   it out on the equation below!
   \[ \left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V
   \right ] \Psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi \]

   You can also watch our screencast on YouTube of a MathJax equation
   being copied and pasted into a variety of applications. Note that this
   screencast is based on MathJax v1.1 so the menu structure is a little
   different in the current version.

Simple integration

   Adding MathJax to your web pages is easy to do.

   If you are using a Content Management System (like Wordpress, Moodle,
   or Drupal) to generate your web site, there may be a plugin to add
   MathJax to your site already, e.g., for Wordpress or Drupal. You may
   need to download or activate the plugin, if one is available.

   If you are using specialized authoring tools, such as LaTeX or
   Markdown, they might integrate MathJax out of the box or have plugins,
   e.g., for LaTeX, Markdown, or even epub.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you write your own HTML (directly or via a template/theme engine),
   you can include MathJax by adding this snippet to your page:
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es
5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>

   Here's a pre-populated example on jsbin you can re-use.

   Note: the configuration file tex-mml-chtml.js is a great way to test
   both TeX and MathML input options at once. You can find leaner combined
   configuration packages in our documentation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you use the snippet above, you will not need to change the version
   number in the src attribute every time the version of MathJax changes.
   If you want to always use a specific version, then use a reference like
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.0.
0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>

   Here's a pre-populated example on jsbin you can re-use.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you are a developer who wants to integrate MathJax into your
   workflow, you can download a copy or fetch it from npm or Packagist and
   configure MathJax yourself. The source code is available from npm as
   well. There are example files in the MathJax Web Examples repository.

   If you prefer to render server-side, MathJax version 3 makes that easy
   as well. There are examples in our MathJax Node Demos repository.

Browser support

   MathJax generates consistent, high-quality output on all browsers &
   platforms. Our output formats support all the major browser, including:
   IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.

   Version 2 of MathJax supported earlier versions of IE, back to IE6 in
   some output formats, so if you need to support extremely old browsers,
   you can continue to use MathJax v2.7.5 for those needs.

   You can find additional details in our documentation

The MathJax Sponsorship Program

   The MathJax project was initiated in 2009 by Design Science, the
   American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Society for Industrial and
   Applied Mathematics (SIAM) with the goal of creating a robust,
   easy-to-use, and universal solution for displaying high-quality
   mathematics online. From the beginning, MathJax was conceived as
   open-source software, on the principle that math display should be part
   of the common infrastructure of the web.

   Providing a universal solution for online math display requires a
   long-term commitment. Our users need MathJax to be reliable and easy to
   use, now and in the future. This requires a continuous and coordinated
   rapid response to browser updates and bugs, keeping up with the
   proliferation of tablets, smartphones, and ebook readers, and a
   consistent approach towards new functionality and performance
   improvements. All of this is important to the community, and requires
   dedicated time, effort, and money.

   Our founding sponsors have been very generous in providing funding;
   however, as more and more individuals and organizations are using
   MathJax and its benefit to the community is growing, its base of
   support grew via the Sponsorship Program. To ensure the long-term
   stability of MathJax, we continuously reach out to the community and
   ask organizations to contribute to the MathJax project by becoming a
   Friend, Supporter, or Partner. All MathJax sponsors share a
   demonstrated and significant interest in the dissemination of
   mathematics on the web, in particular through the MathJax project and
   its activities.

   Please feel free to contact us for any further information about the
   sponsorship program.

About us powered by NumFOCUS

   MathJax is a fiscally sponsored project under the auspices of the
   NumFOCUS Foundation, which serves as the legal and fiscal umbrella for
   the MathJax project and several dozen other open-source, scientifically
   oriented software products.

   Originally, MathJax was supported by The MathJax Consortium, a joint
   venture of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Society for
   Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) to advance mathematical and
   scientific content on the web. We are grateful for the commitment
   offered by the Consortium for over 10 years, without which MathJax
   would not exist today.

Core Goals

   The core of the MathJax project is the development of its
   state-of-the-art, open source, JavaScript platform for display of
   mathematics. Our key design goals are:
     * High-quality display of mathematics notation in all browsers.
     * No special browser setup required.
     * Support for LaTeX, MathML, and other equation markup directly in
       the HTML source.
     * An extensible, modular design with a rich API for easy integration
       into web applications.
     * Support for accessibility, copy and paste, and other rich
       functionality.
     * Interoperability with other applications and math-aware search.
     * Support for equation conversion outside a browser (e.g.,
       preprocessing on a server).

Advisory Committees

   The MathJax Steering Committee and the MathJax Technical Committee meet
   regularly to advise the MathJax team on its development goals and
   priorities. We’re grateful for the support of our committee members!

History

   MathJax grew out of the popular jsMath project, an earlier Ajax-based
   math rendering system developed by Davide Cervone in 2004. In the
   following years, there were many significant developments relevant for
   web publication of mathematics: consolidation of browser support for
   CSS 2.1, Web Font technology, adoption of math accessibility standards,
   and increasing usage of XML workflows for scientific publication.

   In 2009, the AMS, Design Science, and SIAM formed the MathJax
   Consortium to enable Cervone and others to design MathJax from the
   ground up as a next-generation platform, while still benefiting from
   the extensive real-world experience gained from jsMath. Since its
   initial release in 2010, MathJax has become the gold standard for
   mathematics on the web.

   In 2019, MathJax joined the NumFOCUS family of open-source software
   products as a fiscally sponsored project. MathJax continues to be
   supported by the founding sponsors and other partners, as it joins this
   dynamic community.

   Over the years since MathJax was first developed, new web technologies
   and paradigms emerged, and MathJax was not always easy to incoporate
   into these new approaches. In 2017, after nearly a decade of use, work
   on MathJax version 3 was begun, a complete rewrite of MathJax from the
   ground up using modern techniques. This new version integrates with
   current toolchains and frameworks, and can run equally well in a
   browser on a server, or in a stand-alone application. It should form a
   solid foundation for another decade of MathJax use, and its use of the
   Typescript language should make contributions from our user community
   easier to produce and incorporate into MathJax.

The MathJax Team

   The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge. Regular
   contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect, Omar Al-Ithawi, and
   Peter Krautzberger.
