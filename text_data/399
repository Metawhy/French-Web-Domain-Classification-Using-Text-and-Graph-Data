Brian Johnson (Legendary Singer, AC/DC)

     “I can’t believe it was 50 years ago that I first heard Paul Rodgers
     velvet voice singing “The Hunter “, it became the Anthem for every
     Pub, Working Men’s Clubs and City Halls across the UK. Paul was the
     epitome of what every Rock singer should be, he had the looks the
     moves and a soul voice that made everything swing, that’s not an art
     it’s a gift. He also wrote the coolest songs, from “All Right Now”,
     “My Brother Jake”, “Bad Company”,“Feel Like Making Love “, all still
     classics to this day. In 2017 in the theatre in Oxford, I had the
     honor of singing with Paul and Robert Plant, that’s two heroes in
     one song, I get chills when I think of it. Paul’s voice is still in
     perfect shape and you have got to see him live. I can see no better
     way of celebrating 50 years of Paul Rodgers than the live recording
     at The Royal Albert Hall. The spirit of FREE lives on in Free
     Spirit, and Paul Rodgers is the embodiment of it all. Cheers Paul
     and never stop .”
