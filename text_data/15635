Lammar WRIGHT as told by Wilmer WISE, his bandstand friend

   Lammar WRIGHT (1905-1973) was an incredibly talented trumpeter who
   played in Cab’s orchestra between 1930 and 1944. He was one of the
   Missourians when Cab grabbed the band. Wilmer WISE (born in 1936) is
   another incredibly talented trumpeter, who has been playing in many
   fields, from big bands, Broadway pits, philharmonic orchestras, to rock
   and soul studio groups. We were honored to meet and interview him in
   October 2011 about his bandstand friend, Lammar Wright with whom he
   worked between 1956 and 1967. Read the full story →

Count BASIE in Cab Calloway’s orchestra?

     That's right! For an announcement effect, admit that it is powerful.
   The Count at the Cab.  That was almost done. And from 1929!  Count
   Basie and Cab met at the time when young Calloway was the leader of the
   Alabamians. A great friendship was born between the two men...  The Hi
   de Ho Blog reveals a little more...   Read the full story →

"Folks, here's the story about..."

   Cab Calloway, his music and his musicians.

   Since 2006, The Hi De Ho Blog has been dedicated to the King of Hi De
   Ho who entertained a whole era, between the roaring Twenties until his
   death in 1994.

   Jean-François PITET, creator of this website, is also the coauthor of
   TV documentary "Cab Calloway: Sketches" and has written the script for
   the comic book "Cab Calloway" by Cabu.
