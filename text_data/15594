Determinus out now!Apr 26th, 2019

   Determinus album cover

   ”So, today is the day Determinus is finally released. The months
   between finishing an album and the release date are always long, this
   time they’ve felt even longer than in the past. It almost feels like
   we’re a new band coming out with the debut, while on the other hand it
   feels great to make a comeback, to get back to and continue with the
   journey in music that got started all those years ago.

   After we released the first single with the new line-up in January of
   ’18, we didn’t know what to expect. We were not signed, had not done
   anything in ages and all that.

   Less than 48 hrs later we were in a situation that many striving
   musicians and bands never get to; we had options in how to proceed with
   legit record companies. Personally, I took a long hard look in the
   mirror, do I still have the passion for music that making a new
   Leverage album with everything that goes with it requires? It’s easy to
   keep saying ”yeah we’ll make some new music sooner or later” and just
   leave it there. But once you sign, commit to deadlines and book the
   studio dates you’d better be ready to roll up your sleeves and get on
   with it. We talked this through with everyone in the band, and it
   became pretty damn obvious that the fire was there. We made The Devil’s
   Turn EP to get up to speed with recording, and hit the studio again in
   late September to record Determinus. We gave it absolutely everything
   we had, and we are very proud of the way Determinus came about.

   Like with everything else, it’s all about the people you get to meet,
   work with etc. And the people that support & encourage you to keep
   making music in this day and age.

   We are happy to be with one of the most established players in the
   business with Frontiers srl, and I would like to take the opportunity
   here to thank mr Mario DeRiso and Mr Serafino Perugino along with
   everyone else at Frontiers for the very seamless co-operation.

   Thanks also to Eero of Content Union Studios for baring with me through
   the process of producing and mixing. It was hectic, to say the least.

   The thank you list would go on forever, from people who did any actual
   work to families and loved ones who stood with us through the months of
   being absent or half present while focusing on the album.

   But the big thank you belongs to all you out there now listening to
   what we’ve come up with. Rock On!”
