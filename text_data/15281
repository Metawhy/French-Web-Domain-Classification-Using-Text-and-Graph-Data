Netflix increases pricing in Europe, starting in Germany

   April 11, 2019 11.27 Europe/London By Robert Briel

   Netflix has now started increasing its prices in Europe, starting in
   Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

   For the moment two out of three of its subscription variants are
   becoming more expensive in Germany, with the exception of the basic
   tier, which remains unchanged at €7.99 per month.

   The price of the medium tier, which includes HD quality and
   simultaneous usage on two devices, will rise from €10.99 to €11.99 per
   month.

   The most expensive tier, which includes Ultra-HD picture quality and
   higher-quality sound with simultaneous use on up to four devices, the
   monthly fee goes up to €15.99 from 13.99.

   New customers will pay the increased prices immediately, for existing
   users the increase takes effect next month. This is the second price
   increase in Europe since August 2015.

   Netflix justifies the price increases with the broad range of in-house
   productions for which the streaming service spends a lot of money.
   Netflix has survived previous price rounds without any loss of users.
   According to the latest figures, the service has 5.2 million users in
   Germany and a total of 139 million worldwide.

   Last month, Netflix started testing new UK pricing – read: higher
   pricing.

   Recent research from The Diffusion Group suggests Netflix’s current
   round of price increases may have significant implications.

   “The data nugget cited is solid, but it is incomplete without context,”
   wrote Michael Greeson, President of TDG, in an email to Broadband TV
   News.

   “In no way does TDG think a $1 increase in the monthly cost of Netflix
   will result in significant exodus of subscribers. That’s not what the
   data says. My interpretation is that Netflix, Amazon Prime Channels,
   and Hulu (the Big-3 SVOD aggregators) need to be careful about further
   price increases, as research suggests they are nearing a ceiling. In 12
   months, that ceiling may change—such as consumer tolerances.”
