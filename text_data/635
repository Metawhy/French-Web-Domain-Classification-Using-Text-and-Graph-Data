   Sarah’s attic is a website introducing to the Shoah History that
   addresses specifically to children from age 8 to 12 with full respect
   of their sensibility.

   This website invites them to watch and hear tales and expressions
   testifying of the diversity of Jewish cultures transmitted before,
   during and after the Second World War.

   In addition, nine personal itineraries bear witness of the daily life
   of Jews during the war, based on archive documents kept at the Mémorial
   de la Shoah in Paris.
