     * Arabella is 11 months! This sweet little almost one year old
       started taking a few steps this week! Gotta keep up with the big
       sistersüòç She‚Äôs pulling up to stand on her own, crawling up stairs,
       waving bye bye, giving high fives, LOVES bananas, knocking down
       towers, stealing her sisters toys and snacks, and snuggling her
       daddy. #ourarabellabrooke #11monthsold #alwaysbemybaby

     * I created these little counting and sorting bottles a few years ago
       for Madelynn and they are still going strong. Aubrey used mini pom
       poms to sort, count and fill each bottle with the correct number.
       You could also add in some tweezers for more of a fine motor
       challenge! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Find all of the details for this activity and

     * Last year in #mpktotschool Aubrey learned all about letters with
       Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä We started the week making a
       snip and stamp coconut tree. üå¥ She was just beginning to use
       scissors, so rather than having her cut the whole tree out, I cut
       out the pieces and she made snips on the leaves to give them some
       texture. ‚úÇÔ∏è Then she used letter stamps to stamp and identify the
       letters in her name. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Find this activity and more
       #chickachickaboomboom fun here: ‚û°Ô∏èbit.ly/TSChickaBoom . Or click

     * For our #mpkbabybins Yellow theme, I filled our bin with water,
       rubber duckies, balls, pouch lids, cups, bowls and spoons. Arabella
       had a great time dumping, pouring, exploring and Aubrey even joined
       in the fun! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Find all of our Yellow Themed Activities on

     * I found this build a skeleton wall decal set that went perfectly
       with our "My Body" theme this week. üíÄ ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä They are super
       sturdy vinyl and they peel and restick easily from walls and
       windows. Aubrey loved building her own skeleton by putting all the
       bones in the right place! * ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Find this and more My Body
