Our Privacy Policy

Overview

   The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Avazu
   (referred to below "Avazu", "we", "us" and "our"). We understand how
   important it is to keep your personal information confidential, and
   discrete, especially in today's online world. The importance of your
   privacy is outlined in detail below. This Privacy Policy was created to
   inform you what information we collect when you interact with our
   customer’s (“Advertisers”) websites or apps that uses the Avazu
   Services; as well as how that information is collected and used by
   companies that display advertisements("Partners"). The potential
   customers who visit Advertisers' websites that employ our services are
   referred to as "Prospects" throughout this document. Because our
   Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, it is imperative that this
   document is read thoroughly and often.

Personal and Non-Personal Information

   Personally Related Information ("PRI") is data about you that is
   personally identifiable; this is generally described as your name,
   email address, credit card number and/or any other information that
   might be considered private. The PRI that Avazu collects from you is
   information you supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit
   card number and Avazu account login. That information is maintained by
   Avazu only so that you do not have to enter it each time you visit our
   website to login to your account.

   Non-Personally Related Information ("NPRI") data is gathered by Avazu
   and Avazu's Partners, so it can be used by Avazu for the purpose of
   online Retargeting only. NPRI data collected by Avazu for advertising
   purposes is completely anonymous, and only includes the following
   information:
     * Information about your device, such as the type and model,
       manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name,
       IP address, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), applications
       using the Avazu Services and the version of such applications, and
       identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for
       Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID, or unique device
       identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your
       device manufacturer).
     * Log information, including the app or website visited, session
       start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g.,
       WiFi, cellular), and cookie information.
     * The geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location
       data), when location services have been enabled for the mobile app
       or website that uses the Avazu Services.
     * Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the
       type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and
       whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the
       product or service advertised.
     * Information that Avazu Customers and other third parties have
       collected and shared with Avazu, such as information about activity
       in their services. This may include the content you view or
       searches you made, the language you prefer, or other non-personally
       identifying demographic or interest information, to help make the
       ads served to you more relevant.

   None of this information, under any circumstances, individually or
   grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.

Cookies

   To those unfamiliar, a cookie is used to store data on a computer's
   hard drive. In today's online world all websites and applications
   utilize cookies to one extent or another. Avazu uses it's cookies to
   provide a Re-targeting service only. A Prospect receives a cookie when
   interacting with Avazu.net and /or our customer’s (“Advertisers”) or
   Partner’s websites or apps that uses the Avazu Services; Part of
   Avazu's business requires that Avazu has no access to, or control over
   Partners’ cookies. However, requires that each Partner only collect
   NPRI information for the use of serving retargeted ads. Any Partner
   found in violation of this policy will be immediately removed.

Avazu's Guidelines for the Use of Cookies and NPRI

   Avazu's technology requires the use of cookies so we can promptly
   deliver advertisements to our Advertiser's Prospects on our Partner's
   sites or apps. This form of marketing is designated as Retargeting;
   this enhances an Advertiser's potential revenue by specifically
   re-targeting those whom are interested in the products. When a Prospect
   visits one of Avazu's Advertiser's websites, an Avazu pixel on that
   site sets an Avazu cookie on the browser of the Prospect. Therefore
   after the cookie is planted when a Prospect visits one of Avazu's
   Partners' websites; our Partner's website will identify the cookie on
   browser of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our
   Advertiser's website.

   The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser.
   In this instance, Avazu will know that the Prospect first visited our
   Advertiser's website, and then our Partner's website. This information
   is all that is used in reporting our Prospects to advertisers and
   therefore in no way can be used to specifically identify an individual.

   The NPRI data collected by Avazu in the above outlined process of
   Retargeting will be kept by Avazu's database for the period of one year
   only. After one year all data is routinely destroyed. This information
   is only used for the purpose of re-targeting and in no way is personal
   information. You may Opt-Out of Avazu's services with ease by following
   the instructions listed below.

How to Opt-Out of Avazu's Services

   Opting Out of Avazu's services is easy; however please note that by
   Opting-Out, you will not be able to take full advantage of Retargeted
   advertising or have your Avazu account login information remembered for
   you. By deleting your cookies, you will disable Avazu as well as its
   Partners ability to deliver ads. However, you must ensure you clear
   your cookies each time you interact with Avazu or one of our
   Advertiser's websites to ensure you are not receiving Retargeted
   advertisements.
