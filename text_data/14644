What is Bitcoin?

   Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, global, without a central authority,
   open to all, transparent and resistant to censorship. It can be used as
   a payment network, a store of value, and to a lesser extent as a data
   storage solution.

How does Bitcoin work?

   Bitcoin is an innovative peer-to-peer payment network and a new form of
   money. Bitcoin is decentralised and is not controlled by any company or
   government. Any user can become a “node” of the network, which means
   that he can check the validity of transactions by himself.

History of Bitcoin

   After the subprime crisis and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, which
   demonstrated the profound shortcomings of the current financial system,
   the Bitcoin whitepaper, detailing the functioning of the protocol, was
   published on October 31, 2008.

Why Bitcoin?

   Bitcoin is an alternative system that is disconnected from traditional
   financial systems. With Bitcoin, for the first time, the currency is
   not under the control of governments or banks. Using Bitcoin means
   relying on a transparent system governed by mathematical laws that can
   be verified by everyone.

What determines the price of Bitcoin?

   Like other assets, the value of Bitcoin is determined by supply and
   demand in marketplaces. But what are the factors that influence the
   analysis of the different actors and push them to put a buy or sell
   order at a given price?

What is the best Bitcoin wallet?

   The first step before choosing the Bitcoin wallet best suited to your
   needs is to understand what a wallet is. Each solution addresses
   different needs and levels of knowledge

Who controls Bitcoin?

   Bitcoin is the creation of a person or group of people hiding behind
   the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”. If Satoshi came back tomorrow, would
   he be able to control Bitcoin? Is the protocol really secure?

Can Bitcoin be hacked?

   A strong paradigm in Bitcoin is based on its supposedly absolute
   security, with its immutable and unhackable blockchain. Yet, we often
   hear about hackers in the Bitcoin world, with sometimes hundreds of
   millions of dollars stolen. What is it really like?

When is the best time to buy cryptocurrencies?

   Being profitable when trading in cryptocurrencies is often more
   difficult than expected. According to Forbes, 90% of day-traders end
   their year in the red. On the other hand, the concept dollar cost
   averaging to smooth your investment over time, by buying a little every
   month regardless of the value of the asset. This smoothes your “average
   investment cost” and reduces the impact of volatility on your
   portfolio.

Why will there ever be 21 million Bitcoins?

   An essential characteristic of the Bitcoin protocol is the strict limit
   on the number of bitcoins that can be created: it is stipulated that no
   more than 21 million bitcoins can ever be created.

What is the Lightning Network?

   The Lightning Network is a payment channel network where all hosts are
   connected peer-to-peer without any central hierarchy, forming a
   net-like structure. Each node can therefore receive, send, and relay
   transactions. These new features are a significant improvement over
   what Bitcoin already offers.
