The Confidence Code for Girls!

   It’s a paradox familiar to parents everywhere: girls are achieving like
   never before, yet they’re consumed with doubt on the inside. Girls
   worry constantly about how they look, what people think, whether to try
   out for a sports team or school play, why they aren’t getting “perfect”
   grades, and how many likes and followers they have online. For the past
   three years, as the book for women continues to thrive, the requests
   for us to speak at corporations and schools and nonprofits have been
   almost overwhelming. As we travelled the country, we’ve discovered that
   the mothers and fathers we meet are desperate for help translating the
   Confidence Code into a formula that works for girls, so that their
   daughters can be empowered, from a young age, by the power and
   satisfaction of a confident life. We heard their pleas.

Katty Kay

   Claire Shipman is a journalist, author, and public speaker. Before
   turning to writing, Claire spent fourteen years as a regular
   contributor to Good Morning America and other national broadcasts for
   ABC News. Prior to that, she served as the White House correspondent
   for NBC News. She also worked for CNN for a decade, covering the White
   House, and was posted in Moscow for five years. She’ll never forget the
   fall of the Soviet Union and watching ordinary citizens swarm city
   squares to pull down, with rope and a lot of anger, gigantic statues of
   the unpopular communist leaders. Her coverage helped CNN win a Peabody
   Award. She also received a DuPont Award and an Emmy Award for coverage
   of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student uprising. She studied Russian at
   Columbia College and earned a master’s degree from the School of
   International Affairs there. She’s now a member of Columbia’s board of
   trustees. She lives in Washington, DC, with her husband, son, daughter,
   and a pack of dogs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Katty Kay is the anchor of “BBC World News America,” based in
   Washington, D.C. She is also a frequent contributor to “Meet the Press”
   and “Morning Joe.” In addition to her work on women’s issues, Kay has
   covered the Clinton administration sex scandal, three Presidential
   elections and the wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. She was at the
   Pentagon just 20 minutes after a hijacked plane flew into the building
   on 9/11 – one of her most vivid journalistic memories is of
   interviewing soldiers still visibly shaking from the attack.

   Kay grew up all over the Middle East, where her father was posted as a
   British diplomat. She studied modern languages at Oxford and is a
   fluent French and Italian speaker with some “rusty Japanese.” Kay
   juggles her journalism with raising four children with her husband, a
   consultant.
