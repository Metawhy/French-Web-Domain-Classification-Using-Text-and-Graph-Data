   I’m making a new rule. From here on out, Monday’s and doughnuts go
   together like Lucy and Ethel. No longer will we suffer at the hand of
   an abruptly short weekend or an agonizing case of the Monday’s. We
   deserve chocolate hazelnut doughnuts to help us make it through, and
   I’m here to bring them. This past week Brett and I took the kids to the
   fair. It was approximately 347 degrees outside, but we couldn’t resist
   the allure of fried funnel cakes on a similarly hot and sticky day.
   With a bag full of cash (and hand sanitizer), we embraced the sweat and
   watched the kids have the time of their lives.I’ve decided that kids
   visiting the fair require no normal sustenance. While mom and dad are
   dehydrated and weak from lack of nourishment, the kids are soaring high
   on overstimulation. I barely got through the door before I was...

   I know, I know. It's October, and you're getting emailed an ice cream
   recipe? Unfortunately, here in Alabama, it's still 50 shades of
   uncomfortable hot outside, so in lieu of another recipe that requires
   you to fire up the oven I wanted to share a simple no-churn peanut
   butter caramel ice cream that is only 5 ingredients and can be made in
   the comfort of your air conditioned kitchen. Honestly, it sounds more
   than a little delicious to me, so grab a spoon and let's dive in.What
   did we do before no-churn ice cream? Were we all just buying ice cream
   from the store? Using one of those old school hand-churning barrel
   devices? Were we simply not eating frozen desserts at all? I don't want
   to live in a world where no-churn isn't an option, and this  peanut
   butter caramel ice cream situation is approximately 99% of the reason
   why....

   My favorite recipes are the ones that evoke memories. Nana's banana
   bread. My mom's baked spaghetti. Mimi's chicken and dumplings. The
   foods that come attached with a series of moments or a special person
   are the ones that I find most comforting. They just taste like
   home. Since this is the first recipe of the *official* fall season
   (let's be honest, I've been secretly dreaming of fall via my
   denim-filled online shopping carts and cozy coffee creamer choices for
   about a month now), I thought I'd go all out and share a super fallish
   recipe: cheddar apple pie.Apple pie, for me and likely every other
   Thanksgiving-celebrating American, is an incredibly nostalgic recipe.
   One of my first real baking experiences was spent with floury hands in
   a bowl of pie dough destined to encase a gooey apple and cinnamon
   filling. My Mimi, who makes apple and pumpkin pies every Thanksgiving,
   first let...

Almond Toffee Cake

   It's been a long time since I've posted a layer cake which is weird
   kind of since we're all about celebrations here. As the ever-wise Julia
   Child once said, "A party without a cake is just a meeting," so let's
   celebrate, shall we? I have a seriously yummy (and celebratory!) almond
   toffee cake to share with you today, and I can't wait to dive in!To be
   clear, we're not celebrating anything super specific. Earlier this week
   I received some good(ish?) news about a project I've been working on.
   It wasn't anything big,  just encouragement that I really needed. A
   friend and her family came over for dinner later that evening, and we
   decided the news was worth celebrating, not because I had reached any
   specific end goal but because I had endured long enough to see signs of
   breakthrough. Initially I thought it may be premature to ring the
   bells...

Mocha Macarons

   Mocha Macarons by Wood and spoon. Theres are coffee espresso flavored
   French macaron shells filled with a rich semisweet chocolate ganache
   scented with coffee! Learn how to make these elegant delicate fancy

   spoon. Theres are coffee espresso flavored French macaron shells filled
   with a rich semisweet chocolate ganache scented with coffee! Learn how
   to make these elegant delicate fancy cookies on thewoodandspoon.com by
   Kate Wood

   I've always thought there was something magical about macarons. The
   dainty French cookies that line bakery cases like colorful little
   soldiers have always felt fancy, like a special treat reserved for posh
   ladies with tiny dogs and big sunglasses. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm
   delusional, or maybe my inner Francophile is getting away from itself,
   but either way, I absolutely adore macarons. These mocha macarons are
   no exception.I went to France as a junior in college. With stars in my
   eyes and a mini French dictionary in my pocket, I roamed the streets in
   terribly uncomfortable shoes (because fashion, duh) doing my best to
   look like I belonged. Although I've heard many people say that they
   didn't enjoy their time in France, I found the place to be entirely
   alluring: the scent of warm butter and pastry wafting out of patisserie
   doorways; music and the twinkling of wine glasses on...

   You gotta have those back pocket recipes- the ones that come together
   easily, can find a home throughout every season, and never disappoint.
   This vanilla butter loaf is an easy peasy cake that can serve as a nest
   for all of your favorite seasonal fruits and easily doubles as dessert
   and breakfast. It's as beautiful as it is delicious, so let me tell you
   all about it.One of my favorite things about this vanilla butter loaf
   is that it's pretty much dessert disguised as a breakfast bread. You
   know those loaf cakes that are served at coffee shops? This is that
   kind of thing. It has major pound cake vibes, but its loaf shape and
   the swirl of spice through the center of the cake totally establishes
   it as a breakfast food, if you ask me. The whole thing is glazed with a
   simple powdered sugar icing that envelopes the...
