Blog: Talent Beatriz visits India office

   March 03
   Share
   This blog is about my trip to India. A trip that I always thought I was
   going to make some day, but I never would have thought to make it for
   Travix first. I was given the opportunity as part of the ‘Travix Talent
   Trail" Program, which I am currently participating in.

One day before my trip to India

   Arranging my suitcase was not an easy task, I continually kept
   thinking: "What would be a proper dress code for a business environment
   in India?" The weather app on my iPhone told me that it would be warm
   and since it is July, I knew I would be there in the middle of India’s
   rain season. I decided I should pack clothes that would be comfortable
   in warm temperatures while remaining to be formal, so avoiding some of
   my summer clothes such as skirts and shorts.

On our way to India

   I probably was the most exited girl in the entire airplane. The flight
   itself was long and I tried to pass time by sleeping a bit but I could
   not help to wake up from time to time. I simply did not notice that I
   was supposed to be tired since I only felt excited that this was going
   to be the first time that I would be in India and even my first time in
   Asia! In addition, the person that I was going with was Remko, our
   Global Head of HR. I liked that I was going to India together with him
   because I know that he is a nice person and he would be happy to do
   this business trip with me. At the same time, it also made me realize
   that I needed to manage my nervousness and excitement since I do not
   think that is very professional and he is still the Global Head of HR
   of course! :P

Upon arrival

   Once we arrived at the airport of Bangalore around 2:30 in the morning,
   I unfortunately found out that my luggage stayed behind. Since it took
   us a while before we actually received the confirmation that my luggage
   would truly not come anymore, we ended up arriving at the hotel around
   4:00am. I really hated the fact that I did not to have my personal
   stuff in India. I knew that the next day (or actually in a couple of
   hours) I would be introduced to my colleagues at our India office and I
   realized that I would not have any proper clothes. Besides that, as I
   previously said, I really gave a thought on what to pack for coming to
   India and none of that I was able to wear now. Fortunately the airline
   did decide to compensate me by providing some rupees so I would be able
   to buy some clothes meanwhile my luggage would arrive to India some
   days later. Thus, after a short sleep and a nice Indian breakfast,
   Remko and I quickly passed by some stores before going to the office.
   In there I bought some clothes and other personal things that I could
   use the following day or even the coming days..

During my stay

   Once we arrived at the office, I was being introduced to all the
   colleagues over there. It was so nice to meet all of them in person!
   Now I finally had a real face with those pictures and mail addresses
   that I was used to be seeing in internal communication and hangouts!
   The main aim of my business trip in India was to co-work with my
   colleagues there and exchange practices and experiences within HR
   processes, provide the India team with new HR updates, and finally but
   not least assist Remko in giving the “Insight Discovery” workshop to a
   group of 25 employees from the office. Being in India, made me realize
   again that cultures really modify the way people can think and react
   towards something. I am from Mexico myself and while working in the
   Netherlands I already have firsthand experience in cultural differences
   within practices and way of thinking. In India I noticed invisible
   cultural barriers as well. Simply put, culture does matter. I believe
   culture has the power to mold behavior and to make people think the way
   they do. This trip made me realize that. Since day one I opened my mind
   for new experiences. I did not only want to understand Indian culture
   but I wanted to experience it. That, I thought, would allow me to
   better work together with as a team. I can easily say that my stay in
   India felt like one breath. The days passed so fast! We started early
   in the morning and before we knew it, the working day had passed,
   UNBELIEVABLE! Our colleagues over there truly gave us a warm welcome,
   they also took care that Remko and I would feel comfortable. As Dutch
   people would say, they took care that we would feel “gezellig”. Through
   this blog I would therefore really like to thank them and let them know
   that I appreciated very much their warm welcome and useful inputs
   throughout my entire stay. My last day in India was a Saturday and two
   of our colleagues, Shashipriya and Mamatha, gave me a tour in
   Bangalore. We were able to visit a temple, a beautiful palace, a
   military memorial exhibition and a shopping street!! It was a unique
   experience! I have to mention that it was a lovely day! Very active and
   full of different impressions! During this tour Shashipriya brought
   along her two kids, Bhargav and Sannidhi, he is 9 years old and she is
   2 years old. They both rock! Thanks to all four of them I was able to
   finalize my trip in an amazing way where I got a better grasp of the
   Indian culture. But I am aware that what I saw on that day is only a
   tiny taste of India. blog_becky04

What I learned from my trip

   Going to India made me more aware and keen of culture. Culture within
   the organization affects human interaction, levels of communication,
   trust and teamwork. In order to work together as a team we need to
   understand it and embrace it but never try to change it. I will always
   think back to this trip with very positive thoughts. Warm regards,
   Beatriz Moreno

Amadeus and Travix strengthen partnership as live NDC bookings gain momentum

Press Release - May 15, 2019

   A new global distribution agreement signed by Travix and Amadeus marks
                     the next step in their partnership

   Live NDC bookings are in production in several markets through Amadeus
                                Web Services

   Amadeus and global online travel agency, Travix, today announce the
   strengthening of their long-standing partnership through an agreement
   which will see Amadeus become Travix’s global distribution partner.

   The partnership will provide Travix’s online websites and travel
   operators in over 50 markets with greater access to the unrivalled
   breadth of content offered by the Amadeus Travel Platform, enabling
   Travix to better serve its customers. Built on fully open systems, the
   Amadeus Travel Platform harnesses artificial intelligence to bring a
   greater level of personalized content into one integrated platform.

   This announcement also marks an important milestone in Amadeus’ NDC-X
   program. Travix, a driver customer of the program, and Amadeus reveal
   that live NDC bookings have been in production since November last year
   through Amadeus’ new NDC-enabled Web Services solution.

   Travix’s websites are currently offering NDC content in Austria,
   Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
   This content sits alongside traditional EDIFACT content, can be found
   through one search and is displayed in an aggregated way to allow for
   easy comparison.

   This simple, intuitive booking experience stands as a key milestone in
   the NDC-X program as Amadeus works together with multiple airline and
   travel agency partners to industrialize NDC. It is against this
   backdrop that Amadeus prepares for the global rollout of NDC-enabled
   Web Services solution in the coming months.

   John Mangelaars, CEO, Travix, said: “We are proud to be strengthening
   our relationship with Amadeus at a time when Travix continues to expand
   across Europe and internationally, and provide more value to customers
   and airlines. As a global travel company that is experiencing strong
   growth, it’s critical we have a trusted technology partner that can
   provide us with the infrastructure to stay ahead of the curve. Having
   worked with Amadeus for many years, we know the value Amadeus brings
   and we look forward to collaborating further to provide the best
   possible experience to our customers, which now includes NDC content.”

   Decius Valmorbida, President of Travel Channels, Amadeus, said: “It is
   fantastic to announce our distribution agreement and live NDC bookings
   with Travix, an innovative and invaluable partner. This is a testament
   to our longstanding partnership, the quality of our technology and the
   expertise of our people. As we continue to evolve the way travel is
   bought and sold, we’re excited to support Travix in providing more
   personalized and memorable journeys for its customers.”

   Amadeus launched its NDC-X program in February last year, bringing
   together all the NDC activities across the business – as an IT provider
   and aggregator - under one roof. Together with several leading airlines
   and travel sellers, Amadeus is entering the deployment phase of its
   NDC-enabled solutions. To drive the adoption of NDC across the
   industry, all players need to work collaboratively and ensure it works
   for all.

Blog: Talent Beatriz visits India office

   March 03
   Share
   This blog is about my trip to India. A trip that I always thought I was
   going to make some day, but I never would have thought to make it for
   Travix first. I was given the opportunity as part of the ‘Travix Talent
   Trail" Program, which I am currently participating in.

One day before my trip to India

   Arranging my suitcase was not an easy task, I continually kept
   thinking: "What would be a proper dress code for a business environment
   in India?" The weather app on my iPhone told me that it would be warm
   and since it is July, I knew I would be there in the middle of India’s
   rain season. I decided I should pack clothes that would be comfortable
   in warm temperatures while remaining to be formal, so avoiding some of
   my summer clothes such as skirts and shorts.

On our way to India

   I probably was the most exited girl in the entire airplane. The flight
   itself was long and I tried to pass time by sleeping a bit but I could
   not help to wake up from time to time. I simply did not notice that I
   was supposed to be tired since I only felt excited that this was going
   to be the first time that I would be in India and even my first time in
   Asia! In addition, the person that I was going with was Remko, our
   Global Head of HR. I liked that I was going to India together with him
   because I know that he is a nice person and he would be happy to do
   this business trip with me. At the same time, it also made me realize
   that I needed to manage my nervousness and excitement since I do not
   think that is very professional and he is still the Global Head of HR
   of course! :P

Upon arrival

   Once we arrived at the airport of Bangalore around 2:30 in the morning,
   I unfortunately found out that my luggage stayed behind. Since it took
   us a while before we actually received the confirmation that my luggage
   would truly not come anymore, we ended up arriving at the hotel around
   4:00am. I really hated the fact that I did not to have my personal
   stuff in India. I knew that the next day (or actually in a couple of
   hours) I would be introduced to my colleagues at our India office and I
   realized that I would not have any proper clothes. Besides that, as I
   previously said, I really gave a thought on what to pack for coming to
   India and none of that I was able to wear now. Fortunately the airline
   did decide to compensate me by providing some rupees so I would be able
   to buy some clothes meanwhile my luggage would arrive to India some
   days later. Thus, after a short sleep and a nice Indian breakfast,
   Remko and I quickly passed by some stores before going to the office.
   In there I bought some clothes and other personal things that I could
   use the following day or even the coming days..

During my stay

   Once we arrived at the office, I was being introduced to all the
   colleagues over there. It was so nice to meet all of them in person!
   Now I finally had a real face with those pictures and mail addresses
   that I was used to be seeing in internal communication and hangouts!
   The main aim of my business trip in India was to co-work with my
   colleagues there and exchange practices and experiences within HR
   processes, provide the India team with new HR updates, and finally but
   not least assist Remko in giving the “Insight Discovery” workshop to a
   group of 25 employees from the office. Being in India, made me realize
   again that cultures really modify the way people can think and react
   towards something. I am from Mexico myself and while working in the
   Netherlands I already have firsthand experience in cultural differences
   within practices and way of thinking. In India I noticed invisible
   cultural barriers as well. Simply put, culture does matter. I believe
   culture has the power to mold behavior and to make people think the way
   they do. This trip made me realize that. Since day one I opened my mind
   for new experiences. I did not only want to understand Indian culture
   but I wanted to experience it. That, I thought, would allow me to
   better work together with as a team. I can easily say that my stay in
   India felt like one breath. The days passed so fast! We started early
   in the morning and before we knew it, the working day had passed,
   UNBELIEVABLE! Our colleagues over there truly gave us a warm welcome,
   they also took care that Remko and I would feel comfortable. As Dutch
   people would say, they took care that we would feel “gezellig”. Through
   this blog I would therefore really like to thank them and let them know
   that I appreciated very much their warm welcome and useful inputs
   throughout my entire stay. My last day in India was a Saturday and two
   of our colleagues, Shashipriya and Mamatha, gave me a tour in
   Bangalore. We were able to visit a temple, a beautiful palace, a
   military memorial exhibition and a shopping street!! It was a unique
   experience! I have to mention that it was a lovely day! Very active and
   full of different impressions! During this tour Shashipriya brought
   along her two kids, Bhargav and Sannidhi, he is 9 years old and she is
   2 years old. They both rock! Thanks to all four of them I was able to
   finalize my trip in an amazing way where I got a better grasp of the
   Indian culture. But I am aware that what I saw on that day is only a
   tiny taste of India. blog_becky04

What I learned from my trip

   Going to India made me more aware and keen of culture. Culture within
   the organization affects human interaction, levels of communication,
   trust and teamwork. In order to work together as a team we need to
   understand it and embrace it but never try to change it. I will always
   think back to this trip with very positive thoughts. Warm regards,
   Beatriz Moreno

Amadeus and Travix strengthen partnership as live NDC bookings gain momentum

Press Release - May 15, 2019

   A new global distribution agreement signed by Travix and Amadeus marks
                     the next step in their partnership

   Live NDC bookings are in production in several markets through Amadeus
                                Web Services

   Amadeus and global online travel agency, Travix, today announce the
   strengthening of their long-standing partnership through an agreement
   which will see Amadeus become Travix’s global distribution partner.

   The partnership will provide Travix’s online websites and travel
   operators in over 50 markets with greater access to the unrivalled
   breadth of content offered by the Amadeus Travel Platform, enabling
   Travix to better serve its customers. Built on fully open systems, the
   Amadeus Travel Platform harnesses artificial intelligence to bring a
   greater level of personalized content into one integrated platform.

   This announcement also marks an important milestone in Amadeus’ NDC-X
   program. Travix, a driver customer of the program, and Amadeus reveal
   that live NDC bookings have been in production since November last year
   through Amadeus’ new NDC-enabled Web Services solution.

   Travix’s websites are currently offering NDC content in Austria,
   Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
   This content sits alongside traditional EDIFACT content, can be found
   through one search and is displayed in an aggregated way to allow for
   easy comparison.

   This simple, intuitive booking experience stands as a key milestone in
   the NDC-X program as Amadeus works together with multiple airline and
   travel agency partners to industrialize NDC. It is against this
   backdrop that Amadeus prepares for the global rollout of NDC-enabled
   Web Services solution in the coming months.

   John Mangelaars, CEO, Travix, said: “We are proud to be strengthening
   our relationship with Amadeus at a time when Travix continues to expand
   across Europe and internationally, and provide more value to customers
   and airlines. As a global travel company that is experiencing strong
   growth, it’s critical we have a trusted technology partner that can
   provide us with the infrastructure to stay ahead of the curve. Having
   worked with Amadeus for many years, we know the value Amadeus brings
   and we look forward to collaborating further to provide the best
   possible experience to our customers, which now includes NDC content.”

   Decius Valmorbida, President of Travel Channels, Amadeus, said: “It is
   fantastic to announce our distribution agreement and live NDC bookings
   with Travix, an innovative and invaluable partner. This is a testament
   to our longstanding partnership, the quality of our technology and the
   expertise of our people. As we continue to evolve the way travel is
   bought and sold, we’re excited to support Travix in providing more
   personalized and memorable journeys for its customers.”

   Amadeus launched its NDC-X program in February last year, bringing
   together all the NDC activities across the business – as an IT provider
   and aggregator - under one roof. Together with several leading airlines
   and travel sellers, Amadeus is entering the deployment phase of its
   NDC-enabled solutions. To drive the adoption of NDC across the
   industry, all players need to work collaboratively and ensure it works
   for all.
