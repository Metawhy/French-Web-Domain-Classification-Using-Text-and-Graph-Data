Is the Beyond Meat Burger Good for You?

   Rich JacobsAugust 14, 2017Articles, Nutrition38 Comments

What is the Beyond Meat Burger?

   Vegan eating seems to be more and more prevalent these days.  Most
   people go vegan for health reasons whether it is to lose weight or
   decrease inflammation and then the few who just don’t want to eat
   meat.  What’s funny is that even though vegans and vegetarians want to
   avoid meat, they still want burgers.  Go figure.  Before you judge, I
   am not against vegan or vegetarian eating.  In fact I think it could be
   helpful in reducing inflammation and healing people who are chronically
   sick.  None of us eat enough vegetables, so this style of eating would
   force more vegetables into the diet.  However, does that mean that
   processed food, even though it is vegan, is good for you?  Let’s
   continue…

   A brand called “Beyond Meat” has developed a burger that is being
   touted as tasting just like a real burger!  Although they are not
   claiming any health benefits by eating their burger, according to
   Harvard Health Publications, vegetarians believe that they are
   healthier by avoiding meat.^1 Is that necessarily true?  Can you eat
   this meatless burger without any health consequences?  Let’s breakdown
   these ingredients and see!

   Beyond Meat: The Beyond Burger ingredients: Pea Protein Isolate,
   Expeller Pressed Canola Oil, Refined Coconut Oil, Water, Yeast Extract,
   Maltodextrin, Natural Flavors, Gum Arabic, Sunflower Oil, Salt,
   Succinic Acid, Acetic Acid, Non-GMO Modified Food Starch, Cellulose
   From Bamboo, Methylcellulose, Potato Starch, Beet Juice Extract (for
   color), Ascorbic Acid (to maintain color), Annatto Extract (for color),
   Citrus Fruit Extract (to maintain quality), Vegetable Glycerin.

   OK!  Seems like a lot of effort and ingredients to get a burger versus
   beef, and I’m a believer that less is more.  Now, let’s see what the
   purpose and function is of each ingredient in regards to food.

The Ingredients: Broken Down

   Pea protein isolate: an almost complete protein that is the main source
   of protein in the product.^1

   Expeller pressed canola oil: Canola oil is extracted from rapeseed, a
   plant in the cabbage family.  Adds fat and texture.^2

   Refined coconut oil: extracted from coconuts then bleached and
   deodorized to eliminate flavor and smell.  Used for fat and texture.^3

   Water: colorless and odorless substance.  Used for moisture.

   Yeast extract: Hydrolyzed yeast containing free glutamates.  Flavor
   enhancer.

   Maltodextrin: white powder derived from corn, rice, potato starch or
   wheat.  Used as a thickener or filler.^5

   Natural flavors: The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the
   essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate,
   distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which
   contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or
   fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark,
   bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry,
   eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose
   significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.^6

   Gum Arabic: This is a complex polysaccharide (carbohydrate).  Used for
   fiber and texture.^7

   Sunflower oil: An omega-6 oil derived from sunflower seeds.  Used for
   texture and preservative.^8

   Salt: flavor enhancer and preservative.

   Succinic Acid: A colorless crystal with an acid taste.  Used in perfume
   esters. Used in food as a buffer and neutralizing agent.^9

   Acetic Acid: A product of ethanol.  Used as an antibacterial and
   counterirritant.^10 Gives products a vinegar type flavor.

   Non-GMO Modified Food Starch: Usually developed from corn.  Used as a
   stabilizer in food providing desirable texture, consistency and storage
   ability.^11

   Cellulose from Bamboo: Obtained by bleaching and chemically treating
   bamboo.  Used as a stabilizer, fiber and for texture.^12

   Methylcellulose: Derived from a plant origin.  Used to add bulk to the
   product and is not digested.^13

   Potato Starch: Derived from potatoes.  Used as a binder.^14

   Beet juice extract (for color): Derived from beets. Used as food
   coloring and sweetener.^15

   Ascorbic Acid (to maintain color): Commonly used as a preservative.  In
   this case to maintain color.^16

   Annatto Extract (for color): Extracted from annatto seed.  Used for
   color.^17

   Citrus fruit extract (to maintain quality): Extract from citrus.  Used
   as a preservative.^18

   Vegetable Glycerin: Made from vegetable oils during production of soap
   or biodiesel.  May be used as a thickener or wetting agent.^19

How Good are They for You to Consume?

   I’ve laid out the unbiased research of what the ingredients are, so now
   let’s take a look and see how healthy these ingredients are to consume.

   Pea protein isolate: This is an allergen-free protein that is lactose,
   egg and meat-free.  Often consumed by vegetarians and those with
   allergies.  Pea protein has a mostly complete amino acid profile and
   has been shown to be just as effective when compared to whey protein
   for increasing muscle mass.^1, 20

   Expeller pressed canola oil: This is an oil that is highly advertised
   as being heart healthy, and may be acceptable if non-GMO and organic.
   However, you should know this oil is highly processed and higher in
   erucic acid than most other oils.  More recent and older studies show
   that canola oil can cause heart issues, inflammation and lower vitamin
   E which is an effective antioxidant.  Despite the positive health
   claims, studies show that consuming this oil can be harmful to your
   health.^21

   Refined coconut oil: Coconut oil has recently taken some heat by the
   press and American Heart Association as a possible risk factor to heart
   disease.  Despite the minimal research and empty claims, coconut oil
   has been shown to reduce inflammation and decrease body fat.^22,23 All
   that said, refined coconut oil comes in many forms and this product
   does not specify how it is made.  Also, burgers are usually grilled at
   temperatures above 450 degrees, the point at which refined coconut oil
   burns and could become toxic.^24

   Yeast extract: Generally safe, but could cause reactions in those
   intolerant to yeast.  Depending on source, it may not be gluten free or
   free of nitrates.

   Maltodextrin: Is relatively safe depending on where it is derived.  It
   does however, spike blood sugar as it is a polysaccharide and has a
   glycemic load higher than table sugar.^26 Therefore, I would not deem
   it safe especially for those who have blood sugar management issues.

   Natural flavors: We really don’t know what is being used as a “natural
   flavor”.  Some flavors can induce food cravings and others can be
   hiding another flavor.  While there are no direct links to health
   issues, consumers really don’t know what is being used so they are best
   to be avoided.^27

   Gum Arabic: This carbohydrate is a mixture of polysaccharides,
   oligosaccharides and glycoproteins.  Gum Arabic has been shown to
   decrease body fat.^7  However, those with gut issues specifically SIBO,
   could find that this ingredient will irritate the gut because of the
   different saccharides.

   Sunflower oil: Like canola oil, this oil is high in omega-6’s which
   have been shown to be inflammatory^2,8 and consumers don’t always know
   the source of the seed used which could be a health concern.

   Salt: This could be a health concern depending on your current state of
   cardiovascular health.

   Succinic Acid: This additive is regarded as safe as long as the amount
   used in food in in accordance to the FDA.^9 Like some other additives,
   this is a chemically derived substance for consumption.

   Acetic Acid: Regarded as generally safe.

   Non-GMO Modified Food Starch: Regarded as safe.  However, the process
   in which this starch is made involves chemicals and bleaching.  So,
   this is a highly processed starch.

   Cellulose from Bamboo: This is primarily a fiber and therefore
   generally safe to eat.

   Methylcellulose: Although regarded as safe for consumption, it does act
   as a laxative and could cause digestive distress.^28

   Potato Starch: Generally safe.  Potato starch is a resistant starch and
   could be good for improving gut health through feed good bacteria.^29

   Beet juice extract (for color): While beet juice extract has potential
   health benefits,^30 beet juice extract for color is basically harmless
   and has no impact on health in this product.

   Ascorbic Acid: is a form of vitamin C and is generally safe.  Having
   too much of this ingredient could cause digestive distress.^31

   Annatto Extract: Although just a food coloring, there are some reports
   of this product causing irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and rare
   cases of anaphylaxis.^32,33 In general, I would avoid unnatural food
   coloring.

   Citrus fruit extract: As a preservative, this is nothing more than an
   antioxidant to prevent rancidity.^34 It is regarded as safe.

   Vegetable Glycerin: Generally safe although because it is a sugar
   alcohol could elicit gastric issues such as diarrhea, bloating or
   nausea.^19

Final Thoughts

   Beyond Meat has developed a vegan option for those who want to avoid
   meat in their diet.  They have released what’s called the Beyond Burger
   as a viable option.  While this product is vegan friendly, I have some
   reservations about the ingredients.  Most of the ingredients are highly
   processed and chemically treated.

   Although the FDA regards most of these ingredients as generally safe, I
   have reservations when it comes to any product containing so many
   processed ingredients.  While they are generally safe individually, we
   need to think about the combined load of the products.  What are the
   health effects when all of these processed ingredients are consumed at
   one time?  Can the body handle the processing of so many chemically
   produced ingredients?  Other than the pea protein, the top 5
   ingredients are highly refined and processed and have been shown to
   cause a negative reaction in the body according to the studies I’ve
   referenced.

   That said, I would not recommend this product as a viable alternative
   to beef burgers.  There are no issues with being a vegan or
   vegetarian.  As a practitioner, I think it can be very helpful in
   reducing inflammation and living a healthier lifestyle.  Therefore, I
   recommend adhering to that lifestyle and eating real food within the
   guidelines of the vegetarian diet.  If one day you want a burger, I
   recommend eating the real thing as it will be healthier for you than
   this chemically made food.

       I feel like this article goes out of its way to avoid the
       antibiotics one is subject to when consuming meat as well as the
       fact that these burgers are non-gmo. If the article is solely
       focused on health, you missed some points.
       And that’s saying nothing about the environmental benefits of
       non-meat burgers.

       Thank you so much for your input. I have a beef allergy and will
       occasionally eat these when nothing but a burger will satisfy my
       craving. I definitely don’t think they are healthier, but for me
       they are safer.

                 Allergies are different than intolerances. An intolerance
                 is developed over time and can usually be corrected. An
                 allergy is something you are born with or have a genetic
                 disposition.

       Just recently tried them, and I liked them. I’m not so much a vegan
       but more opposed to industrial farmed meat with all conditions the
       animals are raised in. That and the antibiotics industrial meat
       production requires to keep the animals alive long enough to
       butcher seems to make beyond Meat a fair trade off for me, tho I
       will keep eyes open for a better alternative if one comes along.

       i found the beyond meat burger to be the best burger i ever tasted,
       meat or veggie, i don’t like the look of the ingredients but then
       again one has to eat something and in the end i have no clue what
       is in real meat, just because it says beef on the label, what i am
       trying to get at is that the ground beef in a burger is the result
       of what the animal has consumed, the illnesses it has had and the
       medicines and hormones it has been fed, and the stresses of the way
       it was raised and then slaughtered

       Eat the “real thing”? Naw, I don’t eat veggie burgers because I’m
       concerned about the health benefits. I’m concerned about the mass
       slaughtering and abuse of animals, and the deforestation of
       rainforests and other natural areas for crops to feed those
       animals. Besides, I could just make a veggie burger myself, or buy
       a different brand? It’s not rocket science. Everyone knows burgers
       in general are overly processed and it’s better to make your own
       food from natural ingredients. Or at least, I hope they know.
       Everyone seems to forget how hamburger meat is made!

       Nice article Rich, thanks! I wonder what they really use as natural
       flavor: Could they use meat extract? Many “vegetable” comercial
       product (for exaple soups) contain meat extract, and I as a
       vegeterian have to carefully read the ingredients to avoid this
       deceit. But what can one do when the information is concealed by
       this label “natural flavor”?

       While eating whole, unprocessed foods is always best- everyone
       wants a treat or splurge now and then. my body can’t process meat.
       It has always made me sick.
       I agree it’s probably best not to eat these frequently, but the
       same could be said for a real burger.
       Thanks for breaking down all the ingredients and their
       risks/benefits!

       I eat grass fed beef no antibotics or hormones it’s way beef
       suppose to be eaten and actually has great benefits but only twice
       a month I eat them , if you do your research grass fed beef is
       actually healthy for you . But I’m down with trying beyond burger,
       I don’t agree with abuse or factory farming at all, but I get my
       grass fed beef from local farm which actually treats the cows good
       even when they kill them.

            With over 7.5 billion people on earth to feed, using our
            finite resources to grow crops to feed them all is the only
            sane and sustainable solution, instead of feeding it to
            livestock with pathetically little return as food. Grass fed
            cows contribute even more greenhouse gas emissions and the
            numbers just are not sustainable. And sorry, but meat in any
            form is NOT health promoting in humans and is in fact disease
            promoting for cardiovascular issues, cancer, diabetes,
            obesity, auto immunity, etc., via a myriad of mechanisms….
            IGF-1; TMAO; heterocyclic amines (HCA’s), Polycyclic Aromatic
            Hydrocarbon (PAH’s); total lack of fiber antioxidants and
            other protective nutrients; high levels of phosphorus; excess
            saturated fats; heme iron; contaminants such as e.coli,
            listeria, and campylobacter; increasing antibiotic resistance
            strains of bacteria; and whether added or not, we ingest high
            quantities of inherent hormones in animal products. The list
            goes on and on and we are far better off without it.

       It seems that the author of this post is in denial of the ethical
       reasons for not eating meat, the cruel treatment of animals,
       slaughtered in mass. No one wants to die, that includes the
       animals. There’s no humane way to kill an animal, simply not. If
       you don’t want to eat veggie burgers eat veggies in some other
       form. Eating animals is out of the question. This is a step in a
       good direction for those who crave meat flavor. I’ve been vegan for
       years and I find these flavors disgusting anyway so it’s just a
       phase, after not eating near for long time you won’t care about a
       burger.

       I just love how this article avoids mentioning one of the main
       reason people don’t want to eat meat. You say several times that
       people avoid beef burgers for health reasons, and that saying a
       beef burger would be healthier than these in the end, but I
       personally don’t want to eat meat because it’s MEAT!! I don’t eat
       other living things and I also don’t want to contribute to the
       enormous factory farming nightmare.

       REALLY good, however your information of what makes up this burger

       Thank you for the ingredients list and for breaking down the
       effects each individual ingredient can have on the body. I recently
       tried The Beyond Meat Burger for the first time and 10 minutes
       after consumption I had terrible cramping, bloating and gas leading
       me to seek out this very information. I do not see this article as
       biased for or against a vegan life style, but merely to unveil some
       of the purposefully veiled ingredients in this healthier or more
       humane option to animal protein. The thing is, I’ve never had the
       same physical reaction to let’s say Grass-Fed/Grass-Finished
       hamburger. I contribute my adverse reaction to the high amounts of
       processed ingredients, and I will no longer consume this product. I
       am a fan of vegetables and eating a largely plant based diet, but 2
       to 3 times a week I do enjoy non-processed or minimally-processed
       animal protein

       “What’s funny is that even though vegans and vegetarians want to
       avoid meat, they still want burgers. Go figure.”
       What an insensitive and inane comment. Why is it funny that we want
       to eat non-meat alternatives to foods that are familiar, foods like
       those we we grew up with? I never understood the omnivore view that
       vegans and vegetarians should be somehow forced to eat sprouts,
       bulgar and couscous and forgo guilty pleasures and comfort food
       that have always been a part of our lives. We are human just like
       you and subject to similar desires. We sometimes couldn’t be asked
       to cook a meal from scratch after a busy day, and sometimes
       convenience food helps take the edge off a long and arduous day.
       The comment also falls into the trap of generalizing vegans and
       vegetarians as health nuts. You can call yourself a vegan and eat
       only Oreo cookies or Sweet Chili Heat Doritos (both of which are
       vegan). I know a dude who weighed 375 pounds from his unhealthy
       vegetarian diet. He has since lost half his body weight through
       exercise and switching to a (mostly) whole foods diet. I’m a vegan
       and am in the midst of losing the extra 50 pounds I am carrying.
       We’re still human, we still socialize and want to fit in and not be
       the freak in the corner eating a whole pumpkin at BBQs. Of course
       we still want burgers, mac & cheese, hot dogs, pizza and all of the
       other junk foods that everyone indulges in on occasion – we just
       don’t want the hormones, we don’t want to exploit and objectify
       other living beings while eating them, we don’t want to fund the
       highly inefficient meat industry that contributes to 30% of global
       carbon emissions and pollutes our waterways, and we don’t want to
       expose ourselves to food borne illnesses (listeria, ecoli,
       botulism) and the health risks (cancer, heart disease) associated
       with meat consumption. The WHO has labeled beef as a Class 1
       carcinogen, and you believe a beef burger is still the healthier
       alternative? Really?
       Is Beyond Meat a perfect solution? Of course not; but it’s a step
       in the right direction, and consumer demand will encourage
       innovation and even healthier alternatives as time goes on. As long
       as you approach these meat alternatives with the same caution as
       you would any other fast food (stick to a whole foods, plant based
       diet most of the time and don’t fall into being a convenience food
       or junk food vegan, an easy trap to fall into). But if I had to
       choose, I would still avoid beef burgers, considering how beef is
       one of the most polluting and emissions-heavy meat you can eat.
       If you’re going to recommend a meat burger over Beyond Meat, why
       wouldn’t the author recommend a meat that has fewer carbon
       emissions, like a chicken, turkey or a salmon burger? I appreciate
       the breakdown of the ingredients, but the author seems to miss the
       point behind these meat-free burgers and doesn’t have a solid grasp
       on the serious issues surrounding beef production.

       Yeast extract is not MSG. Yeast Extract contains Glutamates, and is
       natural. MSG is synthetically produced. It’s fermented from
       glutamic acid. Glutamates are naturally occurring in many forms.
       MSG is super concentrated synthetic Glutamates. But yeast extract
       isn’t MSG, just like moonlight isn’t sunlight. It contains
       sunlight, but is a very different light. 😁

            Exactly right! Yeast extract naturally occurs glutamate, not
            added. It’s a type of amino acids that exist naturally in most
            of the organism, including human cells.
            MSG is Monosodium glutamate. It’s a product of synthesis for
            the industrial mass production.

       This is the second blog which give incorrect information about
       Yeast Extract – as the ingredient in the beyond meat burger
       ————
       Please got to the following site –
       https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/yeast-extract/
       This makes me think many bloggers don’t know about nutrition
       Is Yeast Extract a Hidden form of MSG?
       The direct answer to the question of whether yeast extract is
       actually just MSG, google notwithstanding, is a resounding no.
       I know I am going against a lot of wellness and health blogs on
       this one. But this is the reality of this much maligned and
       misunderstood food additive.
       Sorry friends, but yeast extract ISN’T MSG.
       Now, this is not to say that autolyzed yeast extract (aka
       hydrolyzed yeast) is good or bad for you. The point is that these
       are completely different things, made in completely different ways.
       Most importantly, they deliver very different forms and
       concentrations of glutamates.
       Yeast extract contains glutamates, just like the natural glutamate
       in bone broth and aged cheeses. However, it also contains other
       compounds that contribute to its unique flavor.
       MSG, on the other hand, is a highly concentrated, synthetic and
       processed form of glutamic acid. It is currently made by bacterial
       fermentation, and nothing else. The issues with the safety and side
       effects of MSG are well known including obesity and headaches among
       others (1).
       But yeast extract isn’t MSG, just like moonlight isn’t sunlight. It
       contains sunlight, but is a very different light. Whole Foods,
       while not a good authority on some topics such as canola oil, has
       an excellent article on hydrolyzed yeast (extract). It identifies
       the differences from MSG in very clear language.

       Point taken Paul. Beyond Meat could well be lying to us
       (obfuscating the truth?), by suggesting that they are using the
       more natural, less concentrated source of glutamate (yeast
       extract), rather than MSG. The highly processed MSG is certainly
       cheaper.
       Anyone from Beyond Meat care to comment?
