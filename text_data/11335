Privacy Policy

   Effective:May 25, 2018

Privacy Commitment

   We care about your privacy and want you to be informed about what we
   do. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share the
   information we receive about our clients and consumers and explains the
   options that are available to you. We’ll try to make this all as clear
   and as simple as possible, but if you have questions, you can contact
   us, and we’ll be happy to help. (See the “Contact Us” section below.)

What We Do

   We have two main product suites: (1) Quantcast Measure and (2)
   Quantcast Advertise. Our Measure products help website owners to
   understand the characteristics and demographics of the people who visit
   their sites. (Here’s an example.) Our Advertise products allow
   businesses to deliver relevant online advertising to individual
   consumers. For companies that want to advertise online, our Advertise
   products help get their ads in front of the people that are most likely
   to find them interesting. For consumers, we provide ads that are the
   most useful and relevant to their interests. And for websites, our
   Advertise products help drive advertising revenue, without which the
   free Internet we all use every day would not exist. In short, we try to
   make online advertising more efficient and pleasant for everyone. In
   order to do all this, we collect and analyze information about
   individual consumer interests.

   We also offer Quantcast Choice, a consent management tool for
   publishers and advertisers built on the IAB Europe Transparency &
   Consent Framework that helps website operators provide consumers with
   information and choices about data. From time to time, we may offer
   additional products.

   You can read more about how our services work in our FAQ.

Scope of This Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy covers all of the information that we collect or
   receive across the Internet and mobile space through our products, as
   well as information we collect or receive from visitors to our Site:
   www.quantcast.com (“Site”) and from registered users of our products.
   We may change this Policy from time to time (see Changes to the Privacy
   Policy section below).

Some Helpful Terminology

   We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our
   business or the online advertising industry. Here are some of the key
   terms that you’ll need to know to make it easier to review this Privacy
   Policy.

Cookies

   A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent
   to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies typically are used
   to store user preferences or IDs. See our FAQ for more information
   about cookies and how they work. You do not have to use cookies, but if
   you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of
   Quantcast.com or all functionality of the Services (as defined below).

Tags

   A tag is a tiny snippet of code inserted into a Partner’s website
   content that is used to collect data related to a website visit.
   Similar functionality is enabled in a Partner’s mobile app through the
   use of an SDK (Software Development Kit). When a user views a Partner’s
   site or uses a Partner’s app, our servers are notified, and we are able
   to collect information from the browser or application. See our FAQ for
   more information about our Tags and SDKs.

Log Data

   Log Data includes (1) information sent to us by browsers that encounter
   our Tags, including, for example, browser type, browser time, time of
   access, screen resolution, IP address, referring site URL, current site
   URL, and search strings; (2) information sent to us by advertising
   exchanges in the form of bid requests, which may include the
   information above as well as information like auction identifiers, for
   the purpose of soliciting bids to place online ads; and (3) information
   received from the Quantcast SDK embedded in mobile apps, which may
   include the above as well as information like device identifier,
   location information, application data and usage information, and
   unique application and installation identifiers.

Personal Information

   Personal information (also sometimes called personal data) is
   information that is associated with an individual and enables that
   individual to be singled out.  Through the use of our tags, sdks, and
   cookies, we collect personal information about you; that is,
   information that does not identify you directly (for example, NOT your
   name or email address) but that may indirectly identify your device.
   Under European privacy law, some information transmitted by Cookies and
   Tags including Log Data are considered personal information. However,
   while we make predictions about your interests based on this
   information, we don’t know who you are. For more information about the
   personal information that we collect, please visit our FAQ page.

Quantcast Partners (“Partners”)

   Our Partners include the site operators and mobile application
   developers that request that we collect information via Tags about the
   visitors to their sites (and users of their apps) through our products.
   We do not jointly control the personal information collected via our
   products with our Partners. Our Partners also include companies that we
   work with to provide the Services. For more information about our
   Partners, including what types of partners we have and what types of
   data we share with them, please visit our Partners page.

Quantcast Services (“Services”)

   This term refers broadly to the entire set of services that we provide
   through our products, including the collection of consumer information,
   the analysis of that information, the provision of that information and
   insights derived from that information to or for our Quantcast
   Partners, and the selection and placement of optimal advertisements and
   content based on that information.

Information Collection and Use

   Legal Bases for Collection and Use

   In order to deliver our Services, we use the information described in
   this Privacy Policy as necessary for our legitimate interests. These
   legitimate interests include our interests in providing, improving, and
   customizing the Services offered to our Partners and providing you with
   relevant advertising and content, unless those interests are overridden
   by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require
   protection of personal information. We may share your information (as
   described in this Privacy Policy) where necessary to pursue our
   legitimate interests and those of our Partners in serving more useful
   and relevant advertising. You have the right to object to this
   processing where we rely on legitimate interests, which is described in
   the How To Object and Opt-Out section below.

   In addition, where you have given us consent to use your information in
   certain ways, we will rely on your consent to process the information.
   You may revoke that consent at any time. Please see the How To Object
   and Opt Out section below for information as to how you may withdraw
   your consent.

Information Collected from the Quantcast Site

   When you visit Quantcast.com, our servers record and collect Log Data
   automatically sent by your browser. We use the Log Data to monitor,
   analyze, administer, and improve the Quantcast Site and our Services.
   As described below in the section Information Shared with Our Service
   Providers, we also allow some Partners to place tags on our Site.

   We require our Quantcast Partners to provide some business contact
   information as part of signing up to use our products, such as full
   name, contact email, physical address, and telephone number. We use
   this business contact information mainly to provide the Services,
   contact you about the Services, administer accounts, and address
   questions and issues you might have. We don’t use this business contact
   information to serve you advertisements.

   If you contact us by email, we keep a record of your contact
   information and correspondence for as long as necessary to deal with
   your correspondence and the issues you raised. If you provide contact
   information to us, we may use that information to contact you with
   Quantcast newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials. If you
   decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
   communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
   provided in any of the communications.

Information Collected through our Services

   When you visit a site or app operated by a Quantcast Partner, the
   Partner permits us to collect Log Data from their sites and apps
   through the use of Tags and Cookies; we also receive information
   directly from our Partners. We associate this information with a unique
   random identifier associated with your device (like a cookie id), but
   we never associate it with your name, email, address, or phone number,
   because we don’t collect that type of directly identifying information
   about consumers. We use this information from Partners, which includes
   information about some of the sites you are visiting and some of the
   apps you are using, as necessary for our legitimate interests to help
   improve the accuracy of our products and to determine what
   advertisements and content might be interesting to you.  For example,
   if you were recently searching for plane tickets to San Francisco, we
   might predict that you are interested in purchasing a nice warm
   sweater, and then show you an ad from one of our Advertising clients
   that sells sweaters. (To be more precise, we would predict that your
   device might belong to a person interested in sweaters, because we
   don’t know who you are.)

   We do not link Log Data to your name, address, email, or phone number,
   or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. We employ appropriate
   organizational and technical security safeguards to keep information
   about you secure and to make it difficult for us to associate it with
   your identity.

   When you visit a site or app that uses Quantcast Choice, including the
   Quantcast Site, we may use tags, cookies, SDKs, and plug-ins to store
   information about privacy notices that you have received and privacy
   choices that you have made. We do this pursuant to the IAB Europe
   Transparency & Consent Framework’s policies and technical
   specifications. We do not use any information collected from Quantcast
   Choice for other purposes. In other words, we do not use that
   information to inform our Measure and Advertise products outside of
   understanding the privacy notices you have received and privacy choices
   you have made.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Information Shared with Our Partners

   We share with third parties certain information, including Log Data, as
   part of providing and improving our products. For example, we disclose
   some of this data to companies involved in ad delivery or ad
   viewability. Likewise, we disclose some of this data in order to
   provide or facilitate site audience measurement, traffic analysis, or
   demographic analysis, and to enable websites to provide their
   advertisers with audience segments that are appropriate for their
   products or services. Since, as described in this Privacy Policy, we do
   not intentionally collect directly identifiable information about
   consumers (like your name or email address), we don’t (and couldn’t)
   share this type of information with Partners. To learn more about
   information that we share with our partners, please visit our Partners
   page.

Information Shared with Our Service Providers

   We use third parties and Quantcast affiliate companies to help us
   administer and improve our products. For example, these companies
   assist with hosting, data processing, database management, and
   administrative tasks on our behalf. These third parties and affiliates
   have access to information about you, including through the placement
   of Tags on our Site, to perform these tasks on our behalf. To learn
   more about service providers for consumer information, please visit our
   Partners page.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

   It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated
   through abuse of the legal system. We reserve the right to disclose
   information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
   private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i)
   to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, and valid subpoenas,
   warrants, and court orders; (ii) to protect the rights, property, and
   safety of ourselves, third parties, or the public in general; and (iii)
   to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

Information Disclosed in a Change of Ownership

   Quantcast may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its
   assets, including information we collect about you, in connection with
   a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets or in the
   event of bankruptcy. We may also make certain information available to
   a potential investor or purchaser (and their advisers) in advance of
   any such transaction completion.

Cross-Platform Associations

   We provide a cross-platform reporting service to Partners that operate
   both websites and mobile apps. To accomplish this, we rely on hashed
   (i.e., scrambled) identifiers derived from user logins to associate
   your usage across mobile and desktop platforms. This allows our Measure
   product to provide meaningful reports across platforms for a single
   Partner. We also sometimes use Log Data or other data from our Partners
   to make guesses about associations between devices or platforms.

Data Retention

   We retain data for as long as necessary to provide our Services and for
   the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we retain
   Log Data for up to 13 months. It is then permanently deleted. We may
   also retain information as is necessary to comply with our legal
   obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements.

How to Object and Opt Out

   If you prefer not to receive interest-based content and ads enabled by
   Quantcast, you can object and opt-out by clicking on the Quantcast “Opt
   Out” link here. Additionally, we are a member of the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI) and participate in the Digital Advertising
   Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program. Each of these programs
   provides an opt-out feature where consumers can choose not to receive
   targeted advertising from any NAI or DAA affiliate. These links will
   take you to the NAI opt out and the DAA opt out. If you are located in
   the European Union, you may prefer to use the EDAA opt out. If you
   choose to opt-out, we will place a cookie on your browser that
   identifies you as having opted out. Then you will not receive
   interest-based content or advertisements enabled by Quantcast and we
   will not log your pattern of website visits or other online media
   consumption. Because our opt-out is cookie-based, your browser must be
   set to accept third party cookies. If you use multiple devices or
   browsers, you’ll have to opt out on each. If you delete the opt out
   cookie, you will need to opt-out again.

   Where you have provided Quantcast with consent to use your data, you
   may revoke that consent at any time. Where you have used Quantcast
   Choice to provide your consent to Quantcast or other vendors, you may
   visit the website where you gave that consent at any time to update
   your choices.

Accessing, Changing, or Deleting Your Information

   If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct, or
   delete the information in your registration profile by logging into
   your account. If you want to delete your account, please contact us.

   If you are located in the EEA and we can properly identify you, you
   have a number of rights with regard to your personal information. For
   example, you have the right to access your information and to have
   inaccuracies in your personal information corrected. In many cases
   where we process your information, you may also have a right to
   restrict or limit the ways in which we use your information. You also
   have the right to object to the processing of your personal information
   and to have it deleted in certain circumstances. You also have a right
   to obtain a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible
   format. For these purposes, go here.

   However, as outlined above, although we make predictions about
   consumers’ interests based on the information collected in accordance
   with this Privacy Policy, we don’t know who you are. Accordingly, if we
   receive a request from you and we cannot identify you (even if you
   provide us with additional information), we may not be able to assist
   you in exercising these rights.

Data Security

   We employ administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to
   protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information that
   we hold. These measures may include encryption and employment of
   information storage security technologies to restrict access to our
   network. Please be aware that no method of transmitting information
   over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. We have
   procedures and security features in place to help keep your data secure
   once we receive it. Additionally, in some instances our Partners or
   others may provide information to us in unencrypted form.

International Transfers

   Quantcast operates a global service. Your information is transferred
   internationally between Quantcast affiliate companies and our Partners
   to countries around the world including the United States, where the
   privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. We
   use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission,
   and may rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about
   certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to
   the United States and other countries. You can contact us to request a
   copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

Our Policy Toward Children

   Quantcast does not knowingly collect data from children under 13, and
   in the EEA under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or
   her child has provided us with personal information without their
   consent, that parent or guardian should contact us. If we become aware
   that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete
   such information from our files.

Health and Sensitive Information

   Quantcast does not knowingly collect or utilize any sensitive
   health-related information, such as, for example, information related
   to past or present medical conditions or prescriptions. In the EEA,
   Quantcast does not knowingly collect or utilize any Personal
   Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
   religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic
   or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an
   individual, or data concerning an individual’s health, sex life, or
   sexual orientation.

Other Websites and Apps

   We contractually require our Partners that use Quantcast Tags and SDKs
   to ensure that their sites and apps containing Quantcast Tags and SDKs
   post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights
   of their visitors. However, the fact that we link to, receive data
   from, or partner with a particular site or app does not mean that we
   endorse it or its privacy practices. These other websites and apps have
   their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we would encourage you
   to read those terms and policies when you visit those websites and use
   those apps.

   persons residing within the United States by Quantcast Corporation,

Privacy Policy

   Effective:May 25, 2018

Privacy Commitment

   We care about your privacy and want you to be informed about what we
   do. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share the
   information we receive about our clients and consumers and explains the
   options that are available to you. We’ll try to make this all as clear
   and as simple as possible, but if you have questions, you can contact
   us, and we’ll be happy to help. (See the “Contact Us” section below.)

What We Do

   We have two main product suites: (1) Quantcast Measure and (2)
   Quantcast Advertise. Our Measure products help website owners to
   understand the characteristics and demographics of the people who visit
   their sites. (Here’s an example.) Our Advertise products allow
   businesses to deliver relevant online advertising to individual
   consumers. For companies that want to advertise online, our Advertise
   products help get their ads in front of the people that are most likely
   to find them interesting. For consumers, we provide ads that are the
   most useful and relevant to their interests. And for websites, our
   Advertise products help drive advertising revenue, without which the
   free Internet we all use every day would not exist. In short, we try to
   make online advertising more efficient and pleasant for everyone. In
   order to do all this, we collect and analyze information about
   individual consumer interests.

   We also offer Quantcast Choice, a consent management tool for
   publishers and advertisers built on the IAB Europe Transparency &
   Consent Framework that helps website operators provide consumers with
   information and choices about data. From time to time, we may offer
   additional products.

   You can read more about how our services work in our FAQ.

Scope of This Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy covers all of the information that we collect or
   receive across the Internet and mobile space through our products, as
   well as information we collect or receive from visitors to our Site:
   www.quantcast.com (“Site”) and from registered users of our products.
   We may change this Policy from time to time (see Changes to the Privacy
   Policy section below).

Some Helpful Terminology

   We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our
   business or the online advertising industry. Here are some of the key
   terms that you’ll need to know to make it easier to review this Privacy
   Policy.

Cookies

   A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent
   to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies typically are used
   to store user preferences or IDs. See our FAQ for more information
   about cookies and how they work. You do not have to use cookies, but if
   you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of
   Quantcast.com or all functionality of the Services (as defined below).

Tags

   A tag is a tiny snippet of code inserted into a Partner’s website
   content that is used to collect data related to a website visit.
   Similar functionality is enabled in a Partner’s mobile app through the
   use of an SDK (Software Development Kit). When a user views a Partner’s
   site or uses a Partner’s app, our servers are notified, and we are able
   to collect information from the browser or application. See our FAQ for
   more information about our Tags and SDKs.

Log Data

   Log Data includes (1) information sent to us by browsers that encounter
   our Tags, including, for example, browser type, browser time, time of
   access, screen resolution, IP address, referring site URL, current site
   URL, and search strings; (2) information sent to us by advertising
   exchanges in the form of bid requests, which may include the
   information above as well as information like auction identifiers, for
   the purpose of soliciting bids to place online ads; and (3) information
   received from the Quantcast SDK embedded in mobile apps, which may
   include the above as well as information like device identifier,
   location information, application data and usage information, and
   unique application and installation identifiers.

Personal Information

   Personal information (also sometimes called personal data) is
   information that is associated with an individual and enables that
   individual to be singled out.  Through the use of our tags, sdks, and
   cookies, we collect personal information about you; that is,
   information that does not identify you directly (for example, NOT your
   name or email address) but that may indirectly identify your device.
   Under European privacy law, some information transmitted by Cookies and
   Tags including Log Data are considered personal information. However,
   while we make predictions about your interests based on this
   information, we don’t know who you are. For more information about the
   personal information that we collect, please visit our FAQ page.

Quantcast Partners (“Partners”)

   Our Partners include the site operators and mobile application
   developers that request that we collect information via Tags about the
   visitors to their sites (and users of their apps) through our products.
   We do not jointly control the personal information collected via our
   products with our Partners. Our Partners also include companies that we
   work with to provide the Services. For more information about our
   Partners, including what types of partners we have and what types of
   data we share with them, please visit our Partners page.

Quantcast Services (“Services”)

   This term refers broadly to the entire set of services that we provide
   through our products, including the collection of consumer information,
   the analysis of that information, the provision of that information and
   insights derived from that information to or for our Quantcast
   Partners, and the selection and placement of optimal advertisements and
   content based on that information.

Information Collection and Use

   Legal Bases for Collection and Use

   In order to deliver our Services, we use the information described in
   this Privacy Policy as necessary for our legitimate interests. These
   legitimate interests include our interests in providing, improving, and
   customizing the Services offered to our Partners and providing you with
   relevant advertising and content, unless those interests are overridden
   by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require
   protection of personal information. We may share your information (as
   described in this Privacy Policy) where necessary to pursue our
   legitimate interests and those of our Partners in serving more useful
   and relevant advertising. You have the right to object to this
   processing where we rely on legitimate interests, which is described in
   the How To Object and Opt-Out section below.

   In addition, where you have given us consent to use your information in
   certain ways, we will rely on your consent to process the information.
   You may revoke that consent at any time. Please see the How To Object
   and Opt Out section below for information as to how you may withdraw
   your consent.

Information Collected from the Quantcast Site

   When you visit Quantcast.com, our servers record and collect Log Data
   automatically sent by your browser. We use the Log Data to monitor,
   analyze, administer, and improve the Quantcast Site and our Services.
   As described below in the section Information Shared with Our Service
   Providers, we also allow some Partners to place tags on our Site.

   We require our Quantcast Partners to provide some business contact
   information as part of signing up to use our products, such as full
   name, contact email, physical address, and telephone number. We use
   this business contact information mainly to provide the Services,
   contact you about the Services, administer accounts, and address
   questions and issues you might have. We don’t use this business contact
   information to serve you advertisements.

   If you contact us by email, we keep a record of your contact
   information and correspondence for as long as necessary to deal with
   your correspondence and the issues you raised. If you provide contact
   information to us, we may use that information to contact you with
   Quantcast newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials. If you
   decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
   communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
   provided in any of the communications.

Information Collected through our Services

   When you visit a site or app operated by a Quantcast Partner, the
   Partner permits us to collect Log Data from their sites and apps
   through the use of Tags and Cookies; we also receive information
   directly from our Partners. We associate this information with a unique
   random identifier associated with your device (like a cookie id), but
   we never associate it with your name, email, address, or phone number,
   because we don’t collect that type of directly identifying information
   about consumers. We use this information from Partners, which includes
   information about some of the sites you are visiting and some of the
   apps you are using, as necessary for our legitimate interests to help
   improve the accuracy of our products and to determine what
   advertisements and content might be interesting to you.  For example,
   if you were recently searching for plane tickets to San Francisco, we
   might predict that you are interested in purchasing a nice warm
   sweater, and then show you an ad from one of our Advertising clients
   that sells sweaters. (To be more precise, we would predict that your
   device might belong to a person interested in sweaters, because we
   don’t know who you are.)

   We do not link Log Data to your name, address, email, or phone number,
   or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. We employ appropriate
   organizational and technical security safeguards to keep information
   about you secure and to make it difficult for us to associate it with
   your identity.

   When you visit a site or app that uses Quantcast Choice, including the
   Quantcast Site, we may use tags, cookies, SDKs, and plug-ins to store
   information about privacy notices that you have received and privacy
   choices that you have made. We do this pursuant to the IAB Europe
   Transparency & Consent Framework’s policies and technical
   specifications. We do not use any information collected from Quantcast
   Choice for other purposes. In other words, we do not use that
   information to inform our Measure and Advertise products outside of
   understanding the privacy notices you have received and privacy choices
   you have made.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Information Shared with Our Partners

   We share with third parties certain information, including Log Data, as
   part of providing and improving our products. For example, we disclose
   some of this data to companies involved in ad delivery or ad
   viewability. Likewise, we disclose some of this data in order to
   provide or facilitate site audience measurement, traffic analysis, or
   demographic analysis, and to enable websites to provide their
   advertisers with audience segments that are appropriate for their
   products or services. Since, as described in this Privacy Policy, we do
   not intentionally collect directly identifiable information about
   consumers (like your name or email address), we don’t (and couldn’t)
   share this type of information with Partners. To learn more about
   information that we share with our partners, please visit our Partners
   page.

Information Shared with Our Service Providers

   We use third parties and Quantcast affiliate companies to help us
   administer and improve our products. For example, these companies
   assist with hosting, data processing, database management, and
   administrative tasks on our behalf. These third parties and affiliates
   have access to information about you, including through the placement
   of Tags on our Site, to perform these tasks on our behalf. To learn
   more about service providers for consumer information, please visit our
   Partners page.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

   It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated
   through abuse of the legal system. We reserve the right to disclose
   information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
   private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i)
   to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, and valid subpoenas,
   warrants, and court orders; (ii) to protect the rights, property, and
   safety of ourselves, third parties, or the public in general; and (iii)
   to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

Information Disclosed in a Change of Ownership

   Quantcast may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its
   assets, including information we collect about you, in connection with
   a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets or in the
   event of bankruptcy. We may also make certain information available to
   a potential investor or purchaser (and their advisers) in advance of
   any such transaction completion.

Cross-Platform Associations

   We provide a cross-platform reporting service to Partners that operate
   both websites and mobile apps. To accomplish this, we rely on hashed
   (i.e., scrambled) identifiers derived from user logins to associate
   your usage across mobile and desktop platforms. This allows our Measure
   product to provide meaningful reports across platforms for a single
   Partner. We also sometimes use Log Data or other data from our Partners
   to make guesses about associations between devices or platforms.

Data Retention

   We retain data for as long as necessary to provide our Services and for
   the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we retain
   Log Data for up to 13 months. It is then permanently deleted. We may
   also retain information as is necessary to comply with our legal
   obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements.

How to Object and Opt Out

   If you prefer not to receive interest-based content and ads enabled by
   Quantcast, you can object and opt-out by clicking on the Quantcast “Opt
   Out” link here. Additionally, we are a member of the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI) and participate in the Digital Advertising
   Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program. Each of these programs
   provides an opt-out feature where consumers can choose not to receive
   targeted advertising from any NAI or DAA affiliate. These links will
   take you to the NAI opt out and the DAA opt out. If you are located in
   the European Union, you may prefer to use the EDAA opt out. If you
   choose to opt-out, we will place a cookie on your browser that
   identifies you as having opted out. Then you will not receive
   interest-based content or advertisements enabled by Quantcast and we
   will not log your pattern of website visits or other online media
   consumption. Because our opt-out is cookie-based, your browser must be
   set to accept third party cookies. If you use multiple devices or
   browsers, you’ll have to opt out on each. If you delete the opt out
   cookie, you will need to opt-out again.

   Where you have provided Quantcast with consent to use your data, you
   may revoke that consent at any time. Where you have used Quantcast
   Choice to provide your consent to Quantcast or other vendors, you may
   visit the website where you gave that consent at any time to update
   your choices.

Accessing, Changing, or Deleting Your Information

   If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct, or
   delete the information in your registration profile by logging into
   your account. If you want to delete your account, please contact us.

   If you are located in the EEA and we can properly identify you, you
   have a number of rights with regard to your personal information. For
   example, you have the right to access your information and to have
   inaccuracies in your personal information corrected. In many cases
   where we process your information, you may also have a right to
   restrict or limit the ways in which we use your information. You also
   have the right to object to the processing of your personal information
   and to have it deleted in certain circumstances. You also have a right
   to obtain a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible
   format. For these purposes, go here.

   However, as outlined above, although we make predictions about
   consumers’ interests based on the information collected in accordance
   with this Privacy Policy, we don’t know who you are. Accordingly, if we
   receive a request from you and we cannot identify you (even if you
   provide us with additional information), we may not be able to assist
   you in exercising these rights.

Data Security

   We employ administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to
   protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information that
   we hold. These measures may include encryption and employment of
   information storage security technologies to restrict access to our
   network. Please be aware that no method of transmitting information
   over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. We have
   procedures and security features in place to help keep your data secure
   once we receive it. Additionally, in some instances our Partners or
   others may provide information to us in unencrypted form.

International Transfers

   Quantcast operates a global service. Your information is transferred
   internationally between Quantcast affiliate companies and our Partners
   to countries around the world including the United States, where the
   privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. We
   use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission,
   and may rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about
   certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to
   the United States and other countries. You can contact us to request a
   copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

Our Policy Toward Children

   Quantcast does not knowingly collect data from children under 13, and
   in the EEA under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or
   her child has provided us with personal information without their
   consent, that parent or guardian should contact us. If we become aware
   that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete
   such information from our files.

Health and Sensitive Information

   Quantcast does not knowingly collect or utilize any sensitive
   health-related information, such as, for example, information related
   to past or present medical conditions or prescriptions. In the EEA,
   Quantcast does not knowingly collect or utilize any Personal
   Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
   religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic
   or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an
   individual, or data concerning an individual’s health, sex life, or
   sexual orientation.

Other Websites and Apps

   We contractually require our Partners that use Quantcast Tags and SDKs
   to ensure that their sites and apps containing Quantcast Tags and SDKs
   post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights
   of their visitors. However, the fact that we link to, receive data
   from, or partner with a particular site or app does not mean that we
   endorse it or its privacy practices. These other websites and apps have
   their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we would encourage you
   to read those terms and policies when you visit those websites and use
   those apps.

   persons residing within the United States by Quantcast Corporation,
