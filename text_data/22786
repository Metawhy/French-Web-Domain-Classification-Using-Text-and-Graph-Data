   Jacek Sienkiewicz

   Featured post

3 new albums

   Since his debut more than two decades ago, Jacek Sienkiewicz became
   something of an institution; regarded as one of the pioneers of Polish
   electronic music scene, for years he was recognised mainly for his
   dense, emotive, soulful sound, converting vocabulary of Detroit techno
   into his absolutely singular language. Eventually, this led to
   unmistakably individual sound, but also fairly secluded position.

   His music, transmitted from his Warsaw base through different
   established channels, but primary via his own Recognition label (almost
   50 releases in 20 years), albeit retaining its dancefloor potential was
   always in some way leaning towards experiment and adventure in sound
   design, and during recent few years this direction became evident.

   In 2014 his collaborations with AtomTM, resulted with joint live record
   and solo abstract album on No. A series of performances with Max
   Loderbauer were documented by live album for Berlin Atonal, as well as
   last year’s stunning “End” CD on Recognition. Also in 2017, Jacek
   released “9702” LP and “9799” 12”, compiling a selection of his
   earliest recordings (from late 90s) – which appeared to sound
   shockingly fresh and up to date, also exemplifying outlines for further
   development and experiments. Finally, 2018 saw “123418”, a digital-only
   album containing four extended pieces – “abstract sound paintings”,
   balancing layers of heavily processed sounds with unorthodox rhythm
   patterns.

   For this year, Jacek is preparing one of his most ambitious works to
   date. Divided into three records, seemingly different, yet united by
   general concept, it’s the result of years of studio work utilising
   different ways of sound manipulation. “IMOW” (“In My Own Wave”) is a
   set of short, heterogeneous pieces utilising hardware experimentation,
   drones and voice samples, an 8-part ritual equally primeval and
   futuristic. “BTWN” (“Between”) is a “classic” ambient album, 50 minutes
   of truly beautiful music, derived solely from MIDI errors and wandering
   synth notes. Finally, “Drogi”, released with Bołt Records, is a hommage
   to Bohdan Mazurek, one of the key composers of Polish contemporary
   electronic and electro-acoustic music, for years working at the famous
   Polish radio Experimental Studio. Jacek follows his offbeat approach
   towards sound, utilising a range of sources and techniques, from his
   teenage tape recordings through hardware to modern sample editing.
   Those three records, complimenting each other, will be released in
   three different formats – vinyl LP, digital download and CD and
   carefully mastered by Atom Tm / Uwe Schmit.

“9702” by Jacek Sienkiewicz – archives – out now !

   Jacek Sienkiewicz “9702” (R-CD006) – out now
   release date : 02/06/2017

   Recognition opens up its archives and invites to a futuristic
   sentimental journey with respective stages set by the “9702”. Album
   contains a set of varied tracks recorded within five years after Warsaw
   label’s launch and its first release. Extended compositions and short
   improvised sound notes resemble eccentric propositions of such labels
   as (early) Warp or Rephlex, standing next to melancholy-saturated
   minimalistic techno and abstract collage structures which prove out to
   share many characteristics of clicks’n’cuts movement of the second half
   of the 1990’s. Usage of human voice samples is an outstanding feature
   of many of these archive materials. Entirety of mastered-anew content
   encompassing both records, contains all principal trademarks which
   distinguish Jacek Sienkiewicz’s creations and his label Recognition –
   utmost care about depth of sound sphere, experimental inclinations and
   focus on complex motoric aspect of the rhythmical base. This collection
   of music from Recognition’s first five years, surprising for its
   freshness and sheer impetus, is a must for all fans of Jacek
   Sienkiewicz and Polish electronic music of the turn of the 20th and
   21st centuries.

END by Max Loderbauer & Jacek Sienkiewicz

   Kosmos of sound phenomena is devoid of a distinct beginning and end,
   fluid and polymorphous. Stream of sound is continuous, no matter
   whether and which volatile events are registered, and which ones are
   omitted. It is a complex state which transgresses borders defined by
   source, signal and mechanism of perception. Pastoral/tropical
   soundscapes and post-brutalist compositions by Max Loderbauer and Jacek
   Sienkiewicz from their “End” CD seem to evoke those situations where
   can actually hear objects, shapes and time flow itself, a sort of
   synaesthesia which erases and obliterates beginnings and ends of
   events, processes and phenomena. Apocalyptic and contemplative spaces
   generated by this pair of seasoned sound creators explode genre
   bastions of ambient and IDM, leading into the spectral areas once
   explored by such pioneers and Popol Vuh or Ilhan Mimaroglu. Above all,
   etheric and extra-sensitive “End” marks the meeting of two incurable
   individualists, who use various tools of their trade to come up with a
   surprisingly atemporal effect, an insistent pulse of detail on an
   ever-morphing background. Without vivid commentary and recognizable
   soundbites of the present, “End” is simultaneously an interesting
   projection of hopes and anxieties of the New Age. Core of tracks
   included on the record has been produced on the occasion of Max and
   Jacek appearing as a live duo during 2015’s Berlin Atonal festival,
   which resulted in well received “Alpine-Tatra-Himalaian” EP “Ridges”.
   Remaining compositions are natural conclusion of their friendship,
   conversations, meetings, trips and recording sessions that operate
   according to the rule of free improvisation with a reduced instrumental
   setup.

   Jacek Sienkiewicz “Hideland” LP/CD/Digital

   “Hideland”, new record by Polish electronic music producer Jacek
   Sienkiewicz is released precisely year after “Drifting”, which largely
   explored tropes of classical club techno sound. Eight (nine in extended
   CD version) tracks comprising this album go beyond easy-to-pigeonhole
   genres, creating a microcosm of utopian sound constructs. Surprisingly
   unobvious and precisely composed release could be fascinating both for
   loyal fans and for new listeners looking for threads of
   experimentalism. It’s another intriguing proposal in Jacek
   Sienkiewicz’s growing discography, but above all – a laboratory where
   dreams and artistic visions metamorphose into concrete reality.

‘INSTYNKT’ BY JACEK SIENKIEWICZ IS OUT NOW!

   Instinct – highly anticipated record released by highly unanticipated
   duo of two labels Bocian (whose repertoire stretches from freeform
   noise to improvised jazz) and Recognition (known for state-of-the-art
   modern techno sound). Four new tracks by Jacek Sienkiewicz appear both
   as essence and antithesis of artist’s earlier work, instead confronting
   listener with hardly categorisable and puzzling form. You can still
   manage to hear echoes of electronic music masters (from Autechre to
   Xenakis) in this material, but Instinct functions as an autonomous
   entity, or a sound event provoking questions rather than attempting to
   answer them. This proposal, very distinct and floating beyond today’s
   tendencies, will undoubtedly worry pessimists shedding their tears over
   end-of-all-aesthetics and music losing its magical aura. It is also
   quite likely to awaken a need for further exploration in all listeners
   open enough – and daring enough.

‘RIDGES’ BY MAX LODERBAUER & JACEK SIENKIEWICZ IS OUT ON RECOGNITION!

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGxdDfTuPXE?feature=oembed

   “Ridges” is a result of a creative encounter between veteran of
   improvised avant-electronics Max Loderbauer (among others, co-creator
   of Sun Electric, member of
   Moritz von Oswald Trio, and frequent collaborator of Ricardo
   Villalobos) and spiritus movens of Warsaw-based label Recognition Jacek
   Sienkiewicz. Meeting takes place not
   only on the level of investigating pure sound and building complex
   structures, but also on the level of fascination with mountainside aura
   and mystique that is common to
   both artists: Alps (Loderbauer) and Tatra (Sienkiewicz), as well as
   with the vocal cultures of communities inhabiting theese areas. Deeply
   introspective and individualistic
   confrontation between two peer sensibilities and imaginative worlds
   gave birth to two separate compositions in the vein of contemplative
   electronic music at it purest.

NOMATTER – the new album on NO WARE is out now!

   This full length album, released as catalogue number No. 302, features
   seven highly crafted pieces of dark, abstract ambient, if we dare to
   add those adjectives to this very original creation. The tracks on
   “Nomatter” were created between 2008 and 2014 and carefully sequenced
   into the album. Touching the psychedelic side of ambient- and
   industrial music, Jacek Sienkiewicz has without doubt managed to expand
   the narrow vocabulary of said genres. The east is the new west!
