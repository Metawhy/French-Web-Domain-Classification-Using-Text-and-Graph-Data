Collecting Unemployment

   By Heather B. Armstrong February 26, 2002

   I lost my job today. My direct boss and the human resources
   representative pulled me into one of three relatively tiny conference
   rooms and informed me that The Company no longer had any use for me.
   Essentially, they explained, they didn’t like what I had expressed on
   my website. I got fired because of dooce.com.

   I guess I could be bitter. I mean, I defended myself rather studiously,
   explaining that I had never mentioned the company or any employee by
   name, and that I had exaggerated several characteristics of the
   personalities showcased in a few of my posts.

   But I really don’t feel like I have the right to be all that bitter. I
   made my bed; I’ll lie in it, to quote the inimitable Courtney Love. I
   understood the risk when I wrote certain things about certain figures
   that key members of my company might discover my website and pooh-pooh
   my endeavors.

   Two weeks ago an anonymous person emailed every vice president of my
   company to inform them that I had written unsavory things on my
   personal website. I have yet to determine who sent the email or why
   this anonymous someone would hide behind a false email address.
   Conversely, I have devised several ways to torture said anonymous
   person when his/her identity surfaces.

   If you’re going to be a whistle-blower, for God’s sake, don’t be a
   coward about it. Fess up, you motherfucker.

   In the meantime, while I look for other steady employment, I’m sure to
   fester over several glaring questions produced in the wake of this
   rather sad course of events:

   1. Should I lose my job over what I have written on my personal
   website, especially if I have made sure not to mention specific places,
   persons, or events by name?

   2. At what point does my personal website, regardless of what I’ve
   published on the site, affect my professional life? If I am not
   responsible for the two colliding (meaning, an anonymous person tips
   off my employer that I run a personal weblog), is it right that my
   employer should condemn me for expressing personal dissatisfaction?
   Would it be any different if someone found a notepad on which I had
   scribbled things about my job and turned it in to my boss?

   3. What recourse do I have?

   4. Does anyone have Nicole Kidman’s phone number? I’ve suddenly got a
   lot of free time.

   Hi. I’m Heather B. Armstrong, and this used to be called mommy
   blogging. But then they started calling it Influencer Marketing:
   hashtag ad, hashtag sponsored, hashtag you know you want me to slap
   your product on my kid and exploit her for millions and millions of
   dollars. That’s how this shit works. Now? Well… sit back, buckle up,
   and enjoy the ride.

Things I Don’t Necessarily Need to Know

   By Heather B. Armstrong February 25, 2002

   I don’t need to know that five people in the last four years have been
   paralyzed while snowboarding down the same hill on which I am going to
   learn how to snowboard. Why did you tell me this? Will this information
   help me learn how to navigate a slippery slab down a slippery slope in
   any conceivable way? I didn’t think so. If I die while learning to
   snowboard I’m going to blame you. I may not be around to blame you, but
   I’ve instructed everyone else to blame you.

   I don’t need to know what species of water-dwelling monster is swimming
   underneath my feet while I’m trying to surf. An endangered member of
   the shark family may frequent these waters, and hoorah for him, for
   lasting this long, but I don’t need to know about it. Don’t tell me
   about the little fishies who swim in schools this close to shore, or
   about the time you almost stepped on a stingray but were lucky enough
   that he was more scared of you. I’m not a very lucky person, you see.
   And I personally don’t find little fishies even remotely cute or
   cuddly. Please just let me continue surfing in ignorance.

   I don’t need to know that the dude performing X-rays on and around my
   abdominal region has really, like, you know, got to get out of here
   fast, man, because he’s got to meet some friends at a bar in a
   half-hour. I know too much already as I concentrate on two rusty hoop
   earrings dangling precariously from his hairy left earlobe while he
   positions a radiation machine ten inches from my reproductive organs.
   I’m certain he has his own needs, too. He’s entitled to his own needs.
   I just don’t need to know about his needs, not here and especially not
   now, not as my skinny bare ass plays peek-a-boo with the backside of
   the hospital gown.

   I don’t need to know that everyone at my office is aware that the
   reason I’ve been calling in sick to work is because I’m constipated ï¿½
   chronically, terrifyingly constipated. Moreover, I do not need to know
   that the Asian database administrator believed you when you lied to him
   and told him that the constipation excuse is just a cover for the fact
   that I have a sex toy stuck up my ass.

Look at me! Asking for your advice! Please be gentle!

   This is a random request to start off a blog post, but you didn’t come
   here to read the website of a law-abiding citizen who really believes
   that George Washington cut down that cherry tree with all of their
   patriotic, law-abiding heart. NO. You came…

“Rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain”

   First, I should explain the new tagline up next to my logo since some

   About the Author
   wave icon

   Hi. I’m Heather B. Armstrong. When I first wrote a bio for this site I
   called myself a SAHM—a Stay At Home Mom, or, Shit Ass Ho
   Motherfucker. More than a decade later I am now what’s referred to as a
   FTSWM—a Full-Time Single Working Mom, or, Fuck That Shit Where’s
   Marijuana.

   This used to be called mommy blogging. But then they started calling it
   Influencer Marketing: hashtag ad, hashtag sponsored, hashtag you know
   you want me to slap your product on my kid and exploit her for millions
   and millions of dollars. That’s how this shit works.

   Now? Well… sit back, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. dooce is back. And
   she’s talking about herself in the third person, so you know you better
   have a barf bag at the ready.
