Brit Kit Party

   Have you heard of Brit + Co? I hadn’t until recently I found their
   iPhone app. It’s kind of like Pinterest, but not. You should look into
   it. They have this fun concept called Brit Kits, and it’s a craft kit
   that gets sent to your door that has everything you need to do a
   project (or two). Anyhow, as I was on the app, they said you could
   apply to be a hostess for a Brit Kit party. So just for kicks, I
   applied. I got picked for June! Woohoo! It was a Summer Soiree Kit, in
   all patriotic colors, so I went with patriotic decorating to get my
   butt in gear for the 4th. (that’s next week, people!)

   Brit Kit Party (1)

   I have this pretty sweet, vintage rope from my grandma in red, white,
   and blue. I hung it on our island my hubby built me with giant push
   pins in red, white, and blue.

   Brit Kit Party (7)

   I had some things set out for refreshments, which I provided a few, and
   other guests brought some treats too. This was before they had gotten
   here.

   Brit Kit Party (6)

   I have a cool, 3 divided tray so I put red, white, and blue napkins in
   it, then piled on treats and snacks in matching colors. I also had
   cookies, water and lemonade. I didn’t get a picture of the cups, but I
   used plastic cups and wrapped them with some patriotic washi tape from
   the party kit.

   Brit Kit Party (5)

   On the table, I had these mason jars holding the scissors, Sharpies,
   and some swirly pipe cleaners for fun. I got the idea for the mason
   jars here at It All Started with Paint. So what was in the kits?

   Brit Kit Party (2)

   It came in a cardboard box with a picture of the finished project on
   the outside.

   Brit Kit Party (3)

   The card had how-tos, and we got a pack of paper straws, lollipop
   sticks, 3 rolls of washi, some baker’s twine, 4 tiles, a foam brush,
   and some gloss varnish. It also came with a gift card for wine to make
   it a real party!

   Brit Kit Party (4)

   Here’s the table all laid out with kits for everyone, and just waiting
   for the guests to come! Once I explained what Brit Kits were and what
   the project was, everyone got down to work!

   Most everyone had kids with them, but they played outside. A few came
   in and wanted to help though. And they could, they were easy projects!

   Brit Kit Party (11)

   Brit Kit Party (18)

   I posted this picture on Instagram. It made 4 coasters, 6 fun straws,
   cupcake/whatever toppers with the lollipop sticks, and a cake bunting.

   Brit Kit Party (17)

   Here’s the people who stayed long enough for me to remember to take a
   picture holding up some of their projects. It was a really fun
   afternoon, and we’re trying to make this a new tradition!

   4th Decor

   Here’s my mason jars holding the straws, lollipop sticks, and cute
   bunting. I kinda love it Smile

   This was tons of fun, so go plan a girl’s craft night/day/afternoon
   whatever!

Surprise!

   This is shocking! I’m actually posting something! Wanna know why I’ve
   been MIA?

   Yeah, I’m expecting #3, it’s a boy, and it’s been rough. I have been
   nauseous and exhausted, so when I do have a minute of feeling good, I
   spend it with those cute girls. Not creating or blogging about it. But
   if you’ve been following along at Instagram (@ashleejuanita), here’s
   some of the little things we’ve been up to the past 5 months. (yeah,
   I’m halfway and still sick. Ugh)

   energy Smile

Easy Elastic Waistband Darts

    I have tall, skinny boys.  They’re built just like The Hubsters.  I
      can’t tell you how many busy Church/School mornings I have run
   downstairs to the sewing machine to hurry and take in a pair of pants.

                Let me show you how fast and easy it can be.

        Easy Elastic Waistband Darts Tutorial From The Crafty Cousins

   Keep in mind that this method can also be used on a regular waistband.

     Crocky brought me these pants one morning and the waist was WAY too
   wide.  I was going to take them in using the method I used here, but I
         had pink thread on my serger.  That wasn’t going to work.

   I made two darts in the waistband instead.  Find the center seam in the
   back of the pants.  Find the sides of the waistband.  You’re going to
     put your darts right in between the center seam and the side seam.
                                 Like this:

                      easy elastic waistband darts (4)

   See where the waistband puckers?  That’s where I sewed the darts.  Now
     do this to the other side, too.  You want them to match!  What is a
                    dart?  Oh, silly me!  This is a dart:

                      easy elastic waistband darts (8)

   See how I gradually sewed from the waistband to where the pockets would
            be?  Except these pants don’t have back pockets…

                      easy elastic waistband darts (9)

                                 One dart…

                      easy elastic waistband darts (5)

                                …two darts!

                      easy elastic waistband darts (7)

           …and this is what it should look like on the outside:

                      easy elastic waistband darts (11)

     You can barely see those darts, and now your kid can keep his pants
         up!  That alteration took less than five minutes.  Awesome!

No Sew Loopy Scarf

   This scarf is fun, fast, and easy to make!  What more could a girl ask
                                    for?

                            It’s cute, too!  :)

                  No sew loopy scarf by the Crafty Cousins

            Start off with a tee shirt, scissors and some ribbon.

                No sew loopy scarf by the Crafty Cousins (1)

    Cut off the hem, and cut the shirt (starting under the armpits) into
                              one inch strips.

                No sew loopy scarf by the Crafty Cousins (4)

   Give all those loops a good stretch, and you’re done!  (Oh, I made a
                              red one, too…)

            Layer them and embellish the scarf however you want.

                               With ribbon…

                No sew loopy scarf by the Crafty Cousins (9)

            With a stretched strip of tee shirt tied in a bow…

                No sew loopy scarf by the Crafty Cousins (11)

                        Or with a fun fabric flower.

                     The possibilities are endless!  :)
