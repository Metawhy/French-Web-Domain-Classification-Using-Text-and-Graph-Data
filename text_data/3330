Extreme sports star killed in base jumping accident

Antoine Montant tragically killed in French Alps

   Extreme sports star killed in base jumping accident

   Base jumper and extreme sports star Antoine Montant has tragically been
   killed in an accident this weekend.

   Antoine was apparently base-jumping in the Anterne region, just north
   of Chamonix. He took off on Friday afternoon from the Pointe de Sales
   in the Fiz mountain range wearing a wingsuit and a parachute.

   Emergency rescue services were called when his parachute failed to
   open. The search lasted most of the weekend before his body was found
   on Sunday afternoon in the Collet d'Anterne.

   Antoine was renowned not only for his daredevil base jumping stunts but
   also for being one of the best speed riding pilots in the world,
   winning many competitions and starring in numerous videos like this one
   shot earlier in Chamonix this year where he swoops down from the top of
   the Aiguille du Midi, riding the cable-car cables like a rail.

   Antoine, aged 33, was from Cruseilles in the Haute Savoie. He also
   worked as a ski and paraglide instructor in the Portes du Soleil and
   was a Red Bull sponsored pilot.

Welcome to Chamonix

   Chamonix is a vibrant town known as both a world-class ski resort and a
   mountaineering destination. Situated in the Haute-Savoie region of
   France, it is bordered by Switzerland and Italy and dominated by the
   incredible Aiguilles de Chamonix mountain chain peaking at the top of
   Mont Blanc (4810m).

   With these vast, jagged mountains towering over the town, the scenery
   here is arguably the most spectacular in the French Alps. The
   snow-capped peaks soar into the bright blue sky, ancient glaciers sweep
   down towards the valley floor and waterfalls cascade through
   pine-covered hillsides.

   The natural beauty of this valley is the main draw for those who love
   the outdoors whether skiers, mountaineers, hikers or sightseers. There
   is a real international feel here, not just from tourists but from
   individuals and families who have decided to settle here from all over
   the world. Come and find out why!

What to see & do in Chamonix

Do

   Chamonix is known as Europe's capital of extreme sports. The resort is
   open and busy all year round, which makes Chamonix a fairly unique
   destination in the French Alps. Apart from the big draw of alpine
   sports, including skiing, snowboarding, climbing, mountain biking,
   cycling, mountaineering and hiking, the area has a number of more
   leisurely pursuits. Forested trails, adventure playgrounds for kids,
   markets and a number of spa facilities all await you here.

See

   The main attraction that brings tourists to this picturesque town is
   Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe at 4810m. Visitors
   either come to reach the summit themselves, view it from the station at
   the top of the Aiguille du Midi cable car (3842m) or take it in from
   the valley floor. Another popular place to visit is the huge Mer de
   Glace glacier, accessed by the vintage Montenvers train. From the top,
   you can descend to an ice cave excavated into the glacier via a gondola
   and a series of walkways and steps.

Welcome to Chamonix

   Chamonix is a vibrant town known as both a world-class ski resort and a
   mountaineering destination. Situated in the Haute-Savoie region of
   France, it is bordered by Switzerland and Italy and dominated by the
   incredible Aiguilles de Chamonix mountain chain peaking at the top of
   Mont Blanc (4810m).

   With these vast, jagged mountains towering over the town, the scenery
   here is arguably the most spectacular in the French Alps. The
   snow-capped peaks soar into the bright blue sky, ancient glaciers sweep
   down towards the valley floor and waterfalls cascade through
   pine-covered hillsides.

   The natural beauty of this valley is the main draw for those who love
   the outdoors whether skiers, mountaineers, hikers or sightseers. There
   is a real international feel here, not just from tourists but from
   individuals and families who have decided to settle here from all over
   the world. Come and find out why!

What to see & do in Chamonix

Do

   Chamonix is known as Europe's capital of extreme sports. The resort is
   open and busy all year round, which makes Chamonix a fairly unique
   destination in the French Alps. Apart from the big draw of alpine
   sports, including skiing, snowboarding, climbing, mountain biking,
   cycling, mountaineering and hiking, the area has a number of more
   leisurely pursuits. Forested trails, adventure playgrounds for kids,
   markets and a number of spa facilities all await you here.

See

   The main attraction that brings tourists to this picturesque town is
   Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe at 4810m. Visitors
   either come to reach the summit themselves, view it from the station at
   the top of the Aiguille du Midi cable car (3842m) or take it in from
   the valley floor. Another popular place to visit is the huge Mer de
   Glace glacier, accessed by the vintage Montenvers train. From the top,
   you can descend to an ice cave excavated into the glacier via a gondola
   and a series of walkways and steps.
