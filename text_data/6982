The Arctic sets yet another record low maximum extent

   The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is part of
   the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental
   Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder. NSIDC
   scientists provide Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis content, with partial
   support from NASA.

   BOULDER, Colo, March 28, 2016—Arctic sea ice was at a record low
   maximum extent for the second straight year, according to scientists at
   the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and NASA.

   “I’ve never seen such a warm, crazy winter in the Arctic,” said NSIDC
   director Mark Serreze. “The heat was relentless.” Air temperatures over
   the Arctic Ocean for the months of December, January and February were
   2 to 6 degrees Celsius (4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit) above average in
   nearly every region.

   Sea ice extent over the Arctic Ocean averaged 14.52 million square
   kilometers (5.607 million square miles) on March 24, beating last
   year’s record low of 14.54 million square kilometers (5.612 million
   square miles) on February 25. Unlike last year, the peak was later than
   average in the 37-year satellite record, setting up a shorter than
   average ice melt season for the coming spring and summer.

   According to NSIDC, sea ice extent was below average throughout the
   Arctic, except in the Labrador Sea, Baffin Bay, and Hudson Bay. It was
   especially low in the Barents Sea. As noted by Ingrid Onarheim at the
   Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway: “A decrease in
   Barents Sea ice extent for this winter was predicted from the influence
   of warm Atlantic waters from the Norwegian Sea.”

   Scientists are watching extent in this area because it will help them
   understand how a slower Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
   (AMOC) may affect Arctic sea ice. “Some studies suggest that decreased
   heat flux of warm Atlantic waters could lead to a recovery of all
   Arctic sea ice in the near future,” said NSIDC senior research
   scientist Julienne Stroeve. “I think it will have more of a winter
   impact and could lead to a temporary recovery of winter ice extent in
   the Barents and Kara seas.”

   This year’s maximum extent is 1.12 million square kilometers (431,000
   square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average of 15.64 million square
   kilometers (6.04 million square miles) and 13,000 square kilometers
   (5,000 square miles) below the previous lowest maximum that occurred
   last year.

   This late winter, ice extent growth in the Arctic has been sluggish.
   “Other than a brief spurt in late February, extent growth has been slow
   for the past six weeks,” said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the
   NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Meier is an affiliate scientist at
   NSIDC and is part of NSIDC’s Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis team.

   Ice extent increases through autumn and winter, and the maximum
   typically occurs in mid March. Sea ice then retreats through spring and
   summer and shrinks to its smallest or minimum extent typically by mid
   September.

   The September Arctic minimum began drawing attention in 2005 when it
   first shrank to a record low extent over the period of satellite
   observations. It broke the record again in 2007, and then again in
   2012. The March Arctic maximum has typically received less attention.
   That changed last year when the maximum extent was the lowest in the
   satellite record.

   “The Arctic is in crisis. Year by year, it’s slipping into a new state,
   and it’s hard to see how that won’t have an effect on weather
   throughout the Northern Hemisphere,” said Ted Scambos, NSIDC lead
   scientist.

   NSIDC will release a full analysis of the winter season in early April,
   once monthly data are available for March.

   Sea Ice News & Analysis.

NSIDC Data on Google Earth

   The National Snow and Ice Data Center offers some of our data in the
   form of images. From these, we have created Google Earth™ files that
   enable you to view them on a virtual globe. Our goal is to help people
   better understand the cryosphere—where the world is frozen—by making
   our data more visible and interactive. Featured Data highlights some of
   our most requested data, as well as our newest Google Earth files.

Arctic sea ice at minimum extent for 2019

   Arctic sea ice likely reached its minimum extent for the year, at 4.15
   million square kilometers (1.60 million square miles) on September 18,
   2019, according to scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center
   (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder. The 2019 minimum is
   ranked at second lowest in the 40-year satellite record, effectively
   tied with 2007 and 2016.

‘Those who work with weather’: Inuit and visiting scientists collaborate for
better weather information

   In 2009, Shari Fox of NSIDC, along with hunters, Elders, and research
   partners in Clyde River, created the Silalirijiit Project, linking
   Inuit knowledge with climate science and environmental modeling to
   better understand how weather patterns are changing in the Clyde River
   area.
