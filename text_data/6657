   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. It rings day and night 24/7
   and there is no end in sight. Once you answer the phone there is
   nothing but silence or the intruisve chatter of a telemarketer. Does
   this scenario sound familiar? How should you know who is at the other
   end of the line? Do you want pick up the phone or leave it be? Who
   calls me? Thousands of people ask the same question every day.
   Tellows.co.nz aims to provide a vast database of spam and scam
   telephone numbers in order to help people identify and locate the
   caller. The bigger the Tellows database grows the higher is chance to
   find out who is behind the nuisance calls. Learn more on tellows-blog

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   Tellows.co.nz accumulates new spam and scam numbers on a daily basis.
   However, the user is the greatest contributor of new numbers!
   Therewith, you provide the knowledge necessary to avoid being ripped
   off. Furthermore, the categorisation and analysis of the callers nature
   and, above all, your rating of the number will climax in the tellows
   score which will convey whether the caller is trustworthy or dubious.
   The greatest advantage lies in sharing all avaiable information on a
   fraudulent number and, thereby, warning the people of looming dangers
   before they even lift the receiver.
