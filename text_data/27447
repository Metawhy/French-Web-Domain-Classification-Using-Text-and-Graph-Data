   Chief Sumo walked over to my desk and said:

   "I want you to pick a platform we’re not on yet and grow it rapidly.
   Set a traffic goal and make a plan."

   Immediately, I knew I wanted to choose Instagram. I’d seen friends and
   previous clients use Instagram to:
     * Build a following from 0-10,000 in a month.
     * Build their email lists with Instagram like nobody’s business.
     * Drive massive traffic back to their websites.

   So I set out to create the quant-based marketing plan that was
   responsible for taking Sumo’s Instagram following of under 1,000 to
   100,000 in eight months.

   More impressively, we took our Instagram following to 50,000 in the
   first 90 days.

   To drive traffic to your site on Instagram you need followers.
   Instagram is a feed. So naturally, the more followers you have, the
   more feeds your posts end up in, and the more eyes on your website,
   content, and products.

   So I’m going to teach you everything I know about building a massive
   following and driving more traffic to your website with Instagram
   marketing.

   This guide is serious business. To grow our account so quickly, we used
   marketing plans, tools, SOPs, and more. So I’ve put together a swipe
   file, including this guide, that I’m giving away to you for the low,
   low price of...well, free.

   chapters:

   for your business?

   Chapter 2: Instagram Foundations to Become a Traffic Generating Machine

Ecommerce Facebook Ads: $1,000,000 Ad Spend (Result = 4X ROI)

   Bonus Material: Hacking Influencer Marketing Video
   [ad5fc16f-3e83-4c3e-b70a-1c0720b365b4]

Taylor Holiday [stories-twitter-icon.png]

   Last Updated Apr 25, 2019

   Spend $1 million in less than 30 days to generate a minimum of $4
   million in sales?!

   That was the challenge given to our team at Common Thread Collective by
   PupSocks, a brand selling pet-themed socks that was currently spending
   only $500 per day on Facebook but wanted to make millions over the
   holiday season. We werenʼt sure we could pull it off — but, well, see
   what happened for yourself:
     * Over the course of 45 days, we sold 80,000 pairs of socks
     * We made a 4x return on ad spend on the first $1,000,000
     * We made a 3.8x return on ad spend on the full $1,500,000
     * The scaling program created more than 100 jobs in 3 states

   Screenshot of iHeartDogs

   I’m going to walk you through exactly how Common Thread Collective
   (CTC) built, managed, and scaled a campaign of this magnitude.

   1Step #1: Build Your Million Dollar Facebook Ad Campaign Foundation
   2Step #2: Find Your 4X ROI Ad Creative
   3Step #3: Create New Audiences For Your 4X ROI Ad Creative
   4Step #4: Decide When To Kill Or Scale Your Ad Sets
   5Step #5: Duplicate Your Winning Ad Sets And Increase The Budget
   6Step #6: Get Advertiser Access To An Influencers Facebook Page

Step #1: Build Your Million Dollar Facebook Ad Campaign Foundation

   If you want to maximize your potential ad spend on a newish Facebook ad
   account, there are four vital things to know.
    1. Your ad account spending limit starts at $750 a day. This is not
       something that is initially obvious to most people, and getting it
       raised can be a pain — and getting it raised to $100,000 a day is
       generally laughed at. This is where having a Facebook rep is
       critical. Generally speaking, you will be assigned a rep when you
       reach a certain level of spend, but having an agency partner that
       has a permanent rep can expedite the process. Especially over the
       holidays, we recommend putting these requests in weeks ahead of
       when you plan to scale.
       Screenshot showing the "set your spending limit" page on the
       Facebook Ads dashboard
    2. Create multiple accounts (we created five). This is a redundancy
       that protects against running into any ad spend issues on peak
       buying days. The last thing you want is to have ad delivery issues
       or suspended accounts when you’re planning on spending over
       $100,000 a day.
       Screenshot showing multiple Facebook ad accounts
    3. Ensure your credit limit is set high enough to support your rapidly
       scaling spend. In our case, we worked with PupSocks to prepay large
       amounts on their credit card ahead of time, since we couldn’t get
       the overall limit raised high enough. Don’t count on your ability
       to keep up with frequent payments on your credit card (to stay
       below the limit) while the campaign is going on, as you’ll get
       stuck waiting on payments to process on weekends and/or holidays.
    4. Check that the website won’t break under the weight of all that
       traffic. If you’re on Shopify this should never be an issue, but
       for all other providers run some projected numbers on anticipated
       concurrent website sessions and load test your site using a tool
       like Load Impact.^[*]

   In the case of PupSocks, we had technical issues for scaling, as they
   store user-uploaded images that are up to 20MB in size on their
   server-side database. Luckily, PupSocks worked endlessly to ensure
   their site could support the traffic we sent.

Step #2: Find Your 4X ROI Ad Creative

   If you’re going to rapidly scale on Facebook during the holidays,
   you’ll need massive reach at the top of the funnel in a very crowded
   and competitive buying environment. To achieve this, enter that
   landscape with a piece of creative you KNOW will drive massive
   engagement (shares = free impressions) and is already pre-loaded with
   validation.

   Going live with BRAND NEW creative on peak buying days like Black
   Friday and Cyber Monday is one of the biggest mistakes we see people
   make. You want to use your absolute best piece of prospecting creative
   to drive the cheapest possible clicks and allow your site to
   communicate the sale.

   When we went live on Black Friday with the ad below, it was already
   loaded with 50,000 likes, comments, and shares. We did this by:
    1. Creating 10-12 different organic posts
    2. Boosting them with a small budget ($50ish) to PupSocks’ Facebook
       fan page audience for the two weeks leading up to the push.
    3. Determining which received the most combined likes, comments, and
       shares.
    4. Set up a PPE (pay per engagement) campaign for the winning ad
       creative to a broad audience (i.e. 10% lookalike audience) at
       $100/day for seven days.

   We only ran the PPE campaign for seven days before going into
   aggressive scaling, because it generated engagement so incredibly
   quickly.

   When you run your PPE campaign there isn’t a minimum level of likes,
   comments and shares you need, or some other magic number for finding a
   winning ad. It’s about allocating a testing budget you can afford, and
   finding your best ad relative to all the ones you are testing.

   Pictured below is the winning ad creative for our PupSocks campaign
   that received engagement for a fraction of a penny.

   Screenshot of how an ad by iHeartDogs looks on Facebook

   Dropping this ad into auctions against terribly boring “20% Off
   Sitewide” text ads is like bringing a gun to a knife fight.

   In total, this ONE ad was able to account for more than 25% of the
   total ad spend ($286,767) and almost 30% of the revenue ($1,184,343).
   Screenshot of a very successful Facebook ad by iHeartDogs

   Spending budget on a few engagement-objective campaigns to find a
   high-performing piece of ad creative ahead of peak buying days can give
   you a massive advantage.

   While you may not hit 50,000 likes, comments and shares on your winning
   ad creative (puppies are pretty viral) you should still have a solid
   level of validation for your ad that will help drive high relevance
   scores, broader reach and lower frequencies.

Step #3: Create New Audiences For Your 4X ROI Ad Creative

   Now you’ve found one piece of ad creative and loaded it with a ton of
   likes, comments, and shares, who should you target when trying to
   scale? The answer is everyone. Or at least anyone you have reason to
   believe might be interested.

   Start with what you know:
     * Lookalikes based on all stages of your funnel), then move to
     * Prime interests (pet owners, fans of pet brands, etc.), then
     * Get wacky (Kardashian interest anyone?)

   We’ll even break out all these audiences into separate placements and
   slice them by gender to try to isolate every possible opportunity. The
   key to scaling is always, always agility. By that, I mean the ability
   to create options for yourself. The more ad sets you can come up with
   at the start, the higher the likelihood of finding something that
   works. In the beginning, you want to have as many ad sets as your
   little fingers will allow you to create.

   For PupSocks we created a total of 828 ad sets during the two-month
   push.
     * 50+ were lookalike audiences (1-10% lookalike audiences on a
       variety of funnel behavior)
     * 200+ were custom audiences
     * 500+ were variations of our lookalike and custom audience ad sets
       broken out by placements, bid type etc.

   GIF showing different audiences on iHeartDogs

   Start with reasonable daily budgets (I recommend three times your
   average order value) on each ad set, then be prepared to kill off
   underperforming ad sets quickly!

   But give yourself options. Trying to predict the right audience and
   applying a massive budget to it is a fool’s errand, unless you have
   loads of historical data.

   This is especially true on peak buying days when consumer purchase
   intent is sky-high. Having loads of ad sets will give you lots of
   flexibility in where and how you scale.

   P.S. Make sure to include a few super-broad audiences — even try a
   default “all” audience.

Step #4: Decide When To Kill Or Scale Your Ad Sets

   In poker, great players say that there are only two decisions you need
   to know how to make in order to win: when to raise, and when to fold.
   The same is true of Facebook ad buying. Your job as a media buyer
   trying to rapidly scale is to determine what information you need to
   decide to kill or raise an ad set, and how fast can you get that data.
   This starts by deeply understanding your unit economics to set a target
   Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), then correlating leading indicators against
   that ROAS.

   We’ve found that the safest top-of-funnel leading indicator for ROAS is
   Cost Per Add-To-Cart (CPATC). When you go live with all your ad sets,
   you’ll want to track this metric for every single one.

   Screenshot of the Facebook Ads dashboard showing how you can set up
   conversion values

   As soon as we got 4-5 add-to-carts, we made a call on whether to kill
   or scale an ad set. If it was too close (within 10% of our target CPATC
   on either side) to call we would wait to see the ROAS on actual
   purchases. Don’t worry too much about statistical significance early on
   — it’s OK if leading indicators aren’t 100% accurate every time. If
   you’ve created enough ad sets, this should help you hone in on the
   winning ad sets pretty quickly.

   As you continue spending, make sure you’re charting your delayed
   attribution (delayed attribution refers to purchases that happen
   outside the single day click/view window). For example, if someone
   clicks on an ad on day 1 of your campaign and then comes back to make a
   purchase on day 7, this purchase will show up in Facebook attributed to
   the ad set/ad on day 1.

   Facebook’s full default attribution window is a 1-day view / 28-day
   click window. That means that your ROAS will continue to increase
   throughout the entire 28-day window as purchases continue to happen.
   Because PupSocks wanted a ROAS target of 4x on a full attribution
   window, we needed to understand how much the ROAS would increase (or
   CPA decrease) over the growing window.

   Knowing this data, we could make better decisions on day one. In order
   to do this, you need to export your Facebook ad data every day into the
   spreadsheet below.

   Screenshot of a spreadsheet outlining a lot of stats for a campaign on
   Facebook Ads

   You can click on File > Make a copy… to use our spreadsheet.
   Delayed Attribution Tracking Spreadsheet

   The key here is to track your 1-, 7- and 28-day click revenue and then
   create a basic calculation that allows you to track the percentage
   increase between each time period.

   Once you get a sense of your total delayed attribution, you can be more
   aggressive on what your scale target becomes. For example, if you begin
   with a target of a $20 CPATC by tracking your delayed attribution and
   finding that your CPATC will decrease by 30% in a 7 day window, you’ll
   realize that you can make a decision to scale at a $26 CPATC (30%
   higher) on day 1 based on how that number comes down over time.

   If your head is spinning from all the math, that’s what ecommerce media
   buying agencies like Common Thread Collective specialize in. If you
   want help scaling a 4X ROI campaign like we did with PupSocks, contact
   us here.

Step #5: Duplicate Your Winning Ad Sets And Increase Your Budget

   Once you begin to see winning ad sets emerging, it’s time to start
   milking those audiences for everything they’re worth! While we
   recommended starting with tons of ad sets and killing them based on
   leading indicators, we would recommend allowing yourself to see those
   ad sets reach your target ROAS with a meaningful number of purchases
   (minimum 4-5) before deciding to scale the ad set.

   But once you do, it’s go time. In a traditional buying scenario, where
   you’re trying to accomplish normal growth over time, you may simply
   decide to increase a winning ad set budget 10-20% per day. When you are
   trying to 200x ad spend in 30 days, ain’t nobody got time for that (and
   we don’t recommend you simply 200x your ad set budget because placing
   all of your eggs in one basket is a recipe for scale stall outs).

   So the second we have a winning ad set, we immediately duplicate the ad
   set with a higher budget (sometimes 3 or 4 times depending on the size
   of the audience) using the same auto bid strategy (auto bidding is the
   default bidding strategy in conversion campaigns). Then we duplicate
   that winning ad set again 3-5 more times with different manual bids
   (the green underlined number below is the manual bid target for the ad
   set).

   Screenshot showing different ad sets and different variables on the
   Facebook Ads dashboard

   We use a spread of manual bid targets because each bid type is going to
   create different auction dynamics, and if you have a strong piece of ad
   creative, you’ll even be able to overbid your CPA target, win more
   auctions and still hit your ROAS! This strategy will allow you to get
   the absolute most out of every single winning audience/ad set
   combination.

Step #6: Get Advertiser Access To An Influencer’s Facebook Page

   Once you are off and scaling from your own ad accounts and have a
   strong sense of the best-performing ad creative, it’s time to figure
   out where you can get additional distribution for that ad creative. At
   CTC, we like to say that the two greatest influences on purchase
   decisions are:
    1. Price
    2. A recommendation from somebody you trust

   So ask yourself, who does your potential customer trust? Often, this is
   where we apply influencer marketing tactics, partnering with
   influencers by getting advertiser access to their Facebook page to run
   paid programs. In the case of PupSocks, we had the perfect partner for
   a program like this: iHeartDogs.

   Screenshot of iHeartDogs

   iHeartDogs is a brand with almost 4 million likes on Facebook and a
   reputation for giving back to the dog community. They have a massive
   following of dog lovers, and they were the perfect partner for a paid
   program.

   To find iHeartDogs as a partner, it didn’t hurt that their founder is a
   close friend and advisor to CTC, but finding people like this isn’t
   that difficult. A few hours of searching on Instagram (use hashtags)
   will reveal a ton of accounts in your space with large followings. Send
   a few direct messages telling people you want to work out a sponsorship
   and you should hear back quickly!

   Here’s the ad creative we ran on iHeartDogs Facebook account. You will
   see that we gave them the same winning ad creative we already knew
   would work from the PupSocks campaign, and then allowed them to create
   ad copy that they felt would feel organic and native to their
   community.

   Ad #1:

   Screenshot of how an ad by iHeartDogs looks on Facebook

   Ad #2:

   Screenshot showing a Facebook ad by iHeartDogs

   We took these two ads, plus three other ads, and ran conversion
   campaigns through the iHeartDogs page targeted at the following
   audiences:
     * iHeartDogs Facebook page engagers
     * iHeartDogs Instagram page engagers
     * iHeartDogs website visitors
     * Our core audiences

   The result was 88,000 new website visitors, 3,184 new customers, and
   $136,316 new revenue.

   Screenshot showing Google Analytics stats for iLoveDogs

   By creating additional channels of advertising and distribution like
   this, and trading on the credibility of an “influential” brand in the
   space, we were able to scale up our ad campaigns and create a win for
   both sides.

   Note: The deal structure that we arranged with iHeartDogs was a
   fixed-pricing package based on an expected cost per thousand of
   impressions (CPM). In other words, we were paying for guaranteed
   audience access we were receiving. The deal included emails to their
   database, advertorial content creation for placement on their site,
   multiple organic social posts, and advertiser access for 30 days. We

3 Key Takeaways To Scale Your Next Facebook Ad Campaign

   Here are the three key takeaways we hope you get from our experience:
     * Plan Ahead. Scaling like this won’t happen without planning. Making
       sure you have your financial, technical, and creative ducks in a
       row is a must.
     * Start Broad, Narrow Down, Then Multiply. Give yourself as many
       potential winning ad/audience combinations as possible to start.
       Kill losers quickly to protect your budget, then duplicate and
       manual bid your winners.
     * Influence The Outcome. Finding additional pages/people that you can
       run your proven ad campaigns through is a powerful way to both
       validate your brand and create additional scale on social
       platforms.

   If you made it this far, you have the right kind of obsession to be
   great at this process, and you deserve a reward. So, for a 20% discount
   on a pair of PupSocks, use code SUMO.

   The following people deserve a massive shoutout for their work on this
   campaign: Nick Shackelford (Strategist), Vincent Wu (Buyer), Caitlin
   Thomason (Account Manager), Adriana Falcon (Designer) and Alex
   Maldonado (Copywriter). And of course none of this would have been
   remotely possible without the insane effort of Zach and his entire
   PupSocks team. The entrepreneurs who create these amazing brands are
   always the real heroes, and we’ll only ever be as good as the products
   themselves.

Ecommerce Facebook Ads: $1,000,000 Ad Spend (Result = 4X ROI)

   Bonus Material: Hacking Influencer Marketing Video
   [ad5fc16f-3e83-4c3e-b70a-1c0720b365b4]

Taylor Holiday [stories-twitter-icon.png]

   Last Updated Apr 25, 2019

   Spend $1 million in less than 30 days to generate a minimum of $4
   million in sales?!

   That was the challenge given to our team at Common Thread Collective by
   PupSocks, a brand selling pet-themed socks that was currently spending
   only $500 per day on Facebook but wanted to make millions over the
   holiday season. We werenʼt sure we could pull it off — but, well, see
   what happened for yourself:
     * Over the course of 45 days, we sold 80,000 pairs of socks
     * We made a 4x return on ad spend on the first $1,000,000
     * We made a 3.8x return on ad spend on the full $1,500,000
     * The scaling program created more than 100 jobs in 3 states

   Screenshot of iHeartDogs

   I’m going to walk you through exactly how Common Thread Collective
   (CTC) built, managed, and scaled a campaign of this magnitude.

   1Step #1: Build Your Million Dollar Facebook Ad Campaign Foundation
   2Step #2: Find Your 4X ROI Ad Creative
   3Step #3: Create New Audiences For Your 4X ROI Ad Creative
   4Step #4: Decide When To Kill Or Scale Your Ad Sets
   5Step #5: Duplicate Your Winning Ad Sets And Increase The Budget
   6Step #6: Get Advertiser Access To An Influencers Facebook Page

Step #1: Build Your Million Dollar Facebook Ad Campaign Foundation

   If you want to maximize your potential ad spend on a newish Facebook ad
   account, there are four vital things to know.
    1. Your ad account spending limit starts at $750 a day. This is not
       something that is initially obvious to most people, and getting it
       raised can be a pain — and getting it raised to $100,000 a day is
       generally laughed at. This is where having a Facebook rep is
       critical. Generally speaking, you will be assigned a rep when you
       reach a certain level of spend, but having an agency partner that
       has a permanent rep can expedite the process. Especially over the
       holidays, we recommend putting these requests in weeks ahead of
       when you plan to scale.
       Screenshot showing the "set your spending limit" page on the
       Facebook Ads dashboard
    2. Create multiple accounts (we created five). This is a redundancy
       that protects against running into any ad spend issues on peak
       buying days. The last thing you want is to have ad delivery issues
       or suspended accounts when you’re planning on spending over
       $100,000 a day.
       Screenshot showing multiple Facebook ad accounts
    3. Ensure your credit limit is set high enough to support your rapidly
       scaling spend. In our case, we worked with PupSocks to prepay large
       amounts on their credit card ahead of time, since we couldn’t get
       the overall limit raised high enough. Don’t count on your ability
       to keep up with frequent payments on your credit card (to stay
       below the limit) while the campaign is going on, as you’ll get
       stuck waiting on payments to process on weekends and/or holidays.
    4. Check that the website won’t break under the weight of all that
       traffic. If you’re on Shopify this should never be an issue, but
       for all other providers run some projected numbers on anticipated
       concurrent website sessions and load test your site using a tool
       like Load Impact.^[*]

   In the case of PupSocks, we had technical issues for scaling, as they
   store user-uploaded images that are up to 20MB in size on their
   server-side database. Luckily, PupSocks worked endlessly to ensure
   their site could support the traffic we sent.

Step #2: Find Your 4X ROI Ad Creative

   If you’re going to rapidly scale on Facebook during the holidays,
   you’ll need massive reach at the top of the funnel in a very crowded
   and competitive buying environment. To achieve this, enter that
   landscape with a piece of creative you KNOW will drive massive
   engagement (shares = free impressions) and is already pre-loaded with
   validation.

   Going live with BRAND NEW creative on peak buying days like Black
   Friday and Cyber Monday is one of the biggest mistakes we see people
   make. You want to use your absolute best piece of prospecting creative
   to drive the cheapest possible clicks and allow your site to
   communicate the sale.

   When we went live on Black Friday with the ad below, it was already
   loaded with 50,000 likes, comments, and shares. We did this by:
    1. Creating 10-12 different organic posts
    2. Boosting them with a small budget ($50ish) to PupSocks’ Facebook
       fan page audience for the two weeks leading up to the push.
    3. Determining which received the most combined likes, comments, and
       shares.
    4. Set up a PPE (pay per engagement) campaign for the winning ad
       creative to a broad audience (i.e. 10% lookalike audience) at
       $100/day for seven days.

   We only ran the PPE campaign for seven days before going into
   aggressive scaling, because it generated engagement so incredibly
   quickly.

   When you run your PPE campaign there isn’t a minimum level of likes,
   comments and shares you need, or some other magic number for finding a
   winning ad. It’s about allocating a testing budget you can afford, and
   finding your best ad relative to all the ones you are testing.

   Pictured below is the winning ad creative for our PupSocks campaign
   that received engagement for a fraction of a penny.

   Screenshot of how an ad by iHeartDogs looks on Facebook

   Dropping this ad into auctions against terribly boring “20% Off
   Sitewide” text ads is like bringing a gun to a knife fight.

   In total, this ONE ad was able to account for more than 25% of the
   total ad spend ($286,767) and almost 30% of the revenue ($1,184,343).
   Screenshot of a very successful Facebook ad by iHeartDogs

   Spending budget on a few engagement-objective campaigns to find a
   high-performing piece of ad creative ahead of peak buying days can give
   you a massive advantage.

   While you may not hit 50,000 likes, comments and shares on your winning
   ad creative (puppies are pretty viral) you should still have a solid
   level of validation for your ad that will help drive high relevance
   scores, broader reach and lower frequencies.

Step #3: Create New Audiences For Your 4X ROI Ad Creative

   Now you’ve found one piece of ad creative and loaded it with a ton of
   likes, comments, and shares, who should you target when trying to
   scale? The answer is everyone. Or at least anyone you have reason to
   believe might be interested.

   Start with what you know:
     * Lookalikes based on all stages of your funnel), then move to
     * Prime interests (pet owners, fans of pet brands, etc.), then
     * Get wacky (Kardashian interest anyone?)

   We’ll even break out all these audiences into separate placements and
   slice them by gender to try to isolate every possible opportunity. The
   key to scaling is always, always agility. By that, I mean the ability
   to create options for yourself. The more ad sets you can come up with
   at the start, the higher the likelihood of finding something that
   works. In the beginning, you want to have as many ad sets as your
   little fingers will allow you to create.

   For PupSocks we created a total of 828 ad sets during the two-month
   push.
     * 50+ were lookalike audiences (1-10% lookalike audiences on a
       variety of funnel behavior)
     * 200+ were custom audiences
     * 500+ were variations of our lookalike and custom audience ad sets
       broken out by placements, bid type etc.

   GIF showing different audiences on iHeartDogs

   Start with reasonable daily budgets (I recommend three times your
   average order value) on each ad set, then be prepared to kill off
   underperforming ad sets quickly!

   But give yourself options. Trying to predict the right audience and
   applying a massive budget to it is a fool’s errand, unless you have
   loads of historical data.

   This is especially true on peak buying days when consumer purchase
   intent is sky-high. Having loads of ad sets will give you lots of
   flexibility in where and how you scale.

   P.S. Make sure to include a few super-broad audiences — even try a
   default “all” audience.

Step #4: Decide When To Kill Or Scale Your Ad Sets

   In poker, great players say that there are only two decisions you need
   to know how to make in order to win: when to raise, and when to fold.
   The same is true of Facebook ad buying. Your job as a media buyer
   trying to rapidly scale is to determine what information you need to
   decide to kill or raise an ad set, and how fast can you get that data.
   This starts by deeply understanding your unit economics to set a target
   Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), then correlating leading indicators against
   that ROAS.

   We’ve found that the safest top-of-funnel leading indicator for ROAS is
   Cost Per Add-To-Cart (CPATC). When you go live with all your ad sets,
   you’ll want to track this metric for every single one.

   Screenshot of the Facebook Ads dashboard showing how you can set up
   conversion values

   As soon as we got 4-5 add-to-carts, we made a call on whether to kill
   or scale an ad set. If it was too close (within 10% of our target CPATC
   on either side) to call we would wait to see the ROAS on actual
   purchases. Don’t worry too much about statistical significance early on
   — it’s OK if leading indicators aren’t 100% accurate every time. If
   you’ve created enough ad sets, this should help you hone in on the
   winning ad sets pretty quickly.

   As you continue spending, make sure you’re charting your delayed
   attribution (delayed attribution refers to purchases that happen
   outside the single day click/view window). For example, if someone
   clicks on an ad on day 1 of your campaign and then comes back to make a
   purchase on day 7, this purchase will show up in Facebook attributed to
   the ad set/ad on day 1.

   Facebook’s full default attribution window is a 1-day view / 28-day
   click window. That means that your ROAS will continue to increase
   throughout the entire 28-day window as purchases continue to happen.
   Because PupSocks wanted a ROAS target of 4x on a full attribution
   window, we needed to understand how much the ROAS would increase (or
   CPA decrease) over the growing window.

   Knowing this data, we could make better decisions on day one. In order
   to do this, you need to export your Facebook ad data every day into the
   spreadsheet below.

   Screenshot of a spreadsheet outlining a lot of stats for a campaign on
   Facebook Ads

   You can click on File > Make a copy… to use our spreadsheet.
   Delayed Attribution Tracking Spreadsheet

   The key here is to track your 1-, 7- and 28-day click revenue and then
   create a basic calculation that allows you to track the percentage
   increase between each time period.

   Once you get a sense of your total delayed attribution, you can be more
   aggressive on what your scale target becomes. For example, if you begin
   with a target of a $20 CPATC by tracking your delayed attribution and
   finding that your CPATC will decrease by 30% in a 7 day window, you’ll
   realize that you can make a decision to scale at a $26 CPATC (30%
   higher) on day 1 based on how that number comes down over time.

   If your head is spinning from all the math, that’s what ecommerce media
   buying agencies like Common Thread Collective specialize in. If you
   want help scaling a 4X ROI campaign like we did with PupSocks, contact
   us here.

Step #5: Duplicate Your Winning Ad Sets And Increase Your Budget

   Once you begin to see winning ad sets emerging, it’s time to start
   milking those audiences for everything they’re worth! While we
   recommended starting with tons of ad sets and killing them based on
   leading indicators, we would recommend allowing yourself to see those
   ad sets reach your target ROAS with a meaningful number of purchases
   (minimum 4-5) before deciding to scale the ad set.

   But once you do, it’s go time. In a traditional buying scenario, where
   you’re trying to accomplish normal growth over time, you may simply
   decide to increase a winning ad set budget 10-20% per day. When you are
   trying to 200x ad spend in 30 days, ain’t nobody got time for that (and
   we don’t recommend you simply 200x your ad set budget because placing
   all of your eggs in one basket is a recipe for scale stall outs).

   So the second we have a winning ad set, we immediately duplicate the ad
   set with a higher budget (sometimes 3 or 4 times depending on the size
   of the audience) using the same auto bid strategy (auto bidding is the
   default bidding strategy in conversion campaigns). Then we duplicate
   that winning ad set again 3-5 more times with different manual bids
   (the green underlined number below is the manual bid target for the ad
   set).

   Screenshot showing different ad sets and different variables on the
   Facebook Ads dashboard

   We use a spread of manual bid targets because each bid type is going to
   create different auction dynamics, and if you have a strong piece of ad
   creative, you’ll even be able to overbid your CPA target, win more
   auctions and still hit your ROAS! This strategy will allow you to get
   the absolute most out of every single winning audience/ad set
   combination.

Step #6: Get Advertiser Access To An Influencer’s Facebook Page

   Once you are off and scaling from your own ad accounts and have a
   strong sense of the best-performing ad creative, it’s time to figure
   out where you can get additional distribution for that ad creative. At
   CTC, we like to say that the two greatest influences on purchase
   decisions are:
    1. Price
    2. A recommendation from somebody you trust

   So ask yourself, who does your potential customer trust? Often, this is
   where we apply influencer marketing tactics, partnering with
   influencers by getting advertiser access to their Facebook page to run
   paid programs. In the case of PupSocks, we had the perfect partner for
   a program like this: iHeartDogs.

   Screenshot of iHeartDogs

   iHeartDogs is a brand with almost 4 million likes on Facebook and a
   reputation for giving back to the dog community. They have a massive
   following of dog lovers, and they were the perfect partner for a paid
   program.

   To find iHeartDogs as a partner, it didn’t hurt that their founder is a
   close friend and advisor to CTC, but finding people like this isn’t
   that difficult. A few hours of searching on Instagram (use hashtags)
   will reveal a ton of accounts in your space with large followings. Send
   a few direct messages telling people you want to work out a sponsorship
   and you should hear back quickly!

   Here’s the ad creative we ran on iHeartDogs Facebook account. You will
   see that we gave them the same winning ad creative we already knew
   would work from the PupSocks campaign, and then allowed them to create
   ad copy that they felt would feel organic and native to their
   community.

   Ad #1:

   Screenshot of how an ad by iHeartDogs looks on Facebook

   Ad #2:

   Screenshot showing a Facebook ad by iHeartDogs

   We took these two ads, plus three other ads, and ran conversion
   campaigns through the iHeartDogs page targeted at the following
   audiences:
     * iHeartDogs Facebook page engagers
     * iHeartDogs Instagram page engagers
     * iHeartDogs website visitors
     * Our core audiences

   The result was 88,000 new website visitors, 3,184 new customers, and
   $136,316 new revenue.

   Screenshot showing Google Analytics stats for iLoveDogs

   By creating additional channels of advertising and distribution like
   this, and trading on the credibility of an “influential” brand in the
   space, we were able to scale up our ad campaigns and create a win for
   both sides.

   Note: The deal structure that we arranged with iHeartDogs was a
   fixed-pricing package based on an expected cost per thousand of
   impressions (CPM). In other words, we were paying for guaranteed
   audience access we were receiving. The deal included emails to their
   database, advertorial content creation for placement on their site,
   multiple organic social posts, and advertiser access for 30 days. We
   always prefer to work on a fixed-fee when possible because it allows us
   to create more margin as we scale versus a variable cost that creates a
   fixed margin.

   Here are the three key takeaways we hope you get from our experience:
     * Plan Ahead. Scaling like this won’t happen without planning. Making
       sure you have your financial, technical, and creative ducks in a
       row is a must.

       being in the same room as him for a few days.
     * He’s rubbed shoulders with and coached some impressive names – from
       former presidents like Bill Clinton, sports superstars like Andre
       Agassi, and billion dollar tech influencers like Salesforce CEO
       Marc Benioff.

   Clearly, he’s doing something right.

   But let’s be realistic. Very few (if any) of us will ever hit the
   worldwide recognition, renown and success Tony has. Which might make
   you wonder if you’ll get anything useful from reading how he markets
   himself.

   After all, most of Tony’s traffic comes from his personal brand. Tony
   likes it 95% organic… just like his eggs.

   But what most people don’t realize is that organic and paid traffic is
   only 39% of Tony’s total traffic.

   The rest comes from advanced marketing tactics Tony and his team use to
   build a multi-million dollar online business around the Tony Robbins
   brand.

[Tip #1] The AIDA Lead Generation Quiz That Can Double Your Product Sales In
The Next 3 Months: “AIDA Formula” Plus Simple Score-Based Email Segmentation

   The primary call-to-action on Tony Robbins’ homepage is “TAKE OUR FREE
   LIFE ASSESSMENT.”

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   This blue button links directly to Tony’s “Wheel of Life” Quiz and is a
   brilliant way to start off his page.

   Instead of instantly pushing products or giving another boring “click
   here” CTA, it gives prospects a you-centric offer via a lead generation
   quiz.

   Screenshot of a questionnaire on Tony Robbins

   It also appeals to a wide audience - whether hot, cold, or anywhere in
   between. Finding out how you can ‘improve your life’ is a universal
   curiosity.

   But this isn’t a clever CTA just because it entices you to click. You
   also have to look at the content of the quiz.

   It encourages quiz-takers to take a hard look at their lives and look
   for areas that could be improved.

   The quiz has the same two questions for 7 different “Wheel of Life”
   categories (which all happen to be areas that Tony has products in).

   Note how Tony uses a slider for people to rate themselves. This makes
   it easy for mobile visitors to complete the quiz by sliding their
   finger on their screen.

   Screenshot of a questionnaire on Tony Robbins

   We have a CTA that’s not only great at enticing a wide range of
   audience members to click, but also agitates their pain points and
   reminds them of reasons why they might seek out Tony in the first
   place.

   And once you’ve completed the quiz, Tony’s marketing team knows better
   than to go straight for the hard sell.

   First, youʼre offered an insight into your ‘gap’ percentage (the
   difference in where you are now and where you want to be in
   life)...which just pokes that pain yet again.

   Screenshot of the Wheel of Life product on Tony Robbins

   Instead of selling, you’re given the option to “SPEAK TO A PERSONAL
   RESULTS SPECIALIST” about the “problems” you’ve just discovered and
   agitated through the quiz.

   This entire sequence is marketing at its finest using the age-old AIDA
   direct response marketing formula:

   Attention: Tony grabs attention with his “Wheel of Life” quiz

   Interest: Tony gets people interested with a series of strategic,
   probing questions

   Desire: Tony gives people their own Gap score and the desire to improve
   it  (who doesn’t want get to 100%, right?)

   Action: Tony makes an offer to speak to one of his personal results
   specialists to strengthen their weakest areas

   It gets even better though. This quiz gives Tony and his team a way to
   segment their email list based on ratings quiz-takers give for
   different aspects of their lives.

   Tony and his team can then deliver the most relatable, relevant, and
   interesting content to each segment.

   Here’s what that looks like: for the sake of the experiment, I gave
   myself a low score in both the ‘Health & Vitality’ as well as the
   ‘Leadership & Impact’ categories.

   Unsurprisingly, these were the first two categories I received emails
   about post-test:

   Screenshot of emails sent by the Tony Robbins team

   The emails all follow the same format. First, they offer a link to a
   useful piece of content based on my quiz results, and then made a
   call-to-action to speak to a personal results specialist.

   Screenshot of an email sent by Tony Robbins for wHEEL OF lIFE

   The takeaway: Use a lead generation quiz at the top of your funnel to
   capture your website visitors’ contact information and segment them
   into categories based on their responses. Tony has 7 categories (health
   & vitality, mind & meaning, love & relationships, productivity &
   performance, career & business, wealth & lifestyle, leadership &
   impact).
   You can do the same for your business based on the different products
   your business sells.

[Tip #2] The “VAKAD Learning Style” Homepage Design That Converts Website
Visitors Into New Product Sales With Low-Commitment CTAs

   Youʼve seen what’s happening above-the-fold on Tony’s homepage, but
   let’s look at what happens as we move further down the homepage.

   Screenshot of a lot of CTAs on Tony Robbins

   You see all those circles? Those are all CTAs.

   10 CTAs to be exact.

   Most businesses would shy away from putting that many CTAs on a single
   page, believing them to be a distraction. In my analysis of Slack’s
   growth strategy, I found just one simple CTA.

   So, how does Tony get away with having so many?

   There are two aspects to Tony’s website that allow this:
    1. The number of products Tony offers
    2. A wide-ranging audience that comes to Tony’s website in varying
       stages of awareness.

   Including so many CTAs gives Tony the chance to appeal to many
   different types of people all looking for different things.

   Also note the amount of free offerings and access to valuable info
   these CTAs give, and how carefully ordered they are.

   First, we have the above-the-fold section with “TAKE OUR FREE LIFE
   ASSESSMENT” as Tony’s primary CTA.

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   Next up, is a CTA for “SCHEDULE YOUR CALL".

   Screenshot of a CTA on Tony Robbins

   Getting someone on a live call is a great way to convert. But making a
   phone call the primary CTA is not only a bit aggressive, but also
   asking them to make a time and energy commitment.

   This is precisely why the current ‘life quiz’ button fits in perfectly
   as the primary CTA (it calls for an easy and low-commitment action) and
   the ‘schedule your call’ button fits in best as a secondary CTA.

   Continuing on, you’ll find several CTAs asking readers to “LEARN MORE”
   about making improvement in either their professional or personal life
   (we’ll talk about what happens when you click these links in the next
   tip).

   This is the lowest-commitment CTA on the page.

   Screenshot of two calls to action on Tony Robbins

   Next up is a CTA to read more about Tony.

   Screenshot of the About page on Tony Robbins

   Since Tony is selling his personal brand just as much as his products,
   it makes sense that he gives readers a venue to learn more about him.

   Take note of the sticky scroll bar at the bottom of the page for Tony’s
   social media accounts and newsletter. This bar doesnʼt show up until
   you hit this ‘About’ section while you scroll. By not having this bar
   follow readers from the very top, grabs attention more effectively, and
   isn’t introduced until the reader’s awareness of Tony has been
   increased.

   Next up is a CTA to “Read Maria’s story”, and stories of other famous
   people who have had success with Tony:

   Screenshot of a testimonial on Tony Robbins

   Tony knows how to leverage his ‘social proof’ (and is a guy that
   name-drops quite often… just ask Noah).

   But dumping all your social proof on one page is distracting. So he
   gives readers the option to click and learn more if that case study
   resonates with them.

   After the social proof section, Tony has a “LEARN MORE” CTA for a free
   app that many of Tony’s audience members would likely find useful:

   Screenshot of a landing page on the Tony Robbins website

   This app is just one part of Tony’s content marketing strategy that
   helps nudge prospects toward buying by:
     * Giving them an offer that’s easy to say “yes” to
     * Providing the audience with free value which they can access
       anytime when they are on-the-go via their mobile (which in turn
       builds up their trust and confidence in Tony and his products)
     * Presenting the audience with a ‘taste’ of what working with Tony
       could be like

   The next two sections aren’t explicit CTAs, but a promotion of Tony’s
   blog and video content. They serve the same purpose as Tony’s app in
   that they offer readers access to free, useful content:

   Screenshot of relevant articles on Tony Robbins

   Screenshot of featured videos on Tony Robbins

   Golden Nugget: Note how Tony’s blog post categories are divided into
   the same categories that make up the quiz in tip #1.

   This isn’t an accident. Tony is sending category-specific content to
   nurture his leads, based on their scores from his quiz. #genius

   We move onto Tony’s ‘big sell’: “RESERVE YOUR SEAT” in one of his
   seminars:

   Screenshot of the events page on Tony Robbins

   This is the first time any mention of a product appears on Tony’s
   homepage. But, if this is the action Tony really wants people to take,
   why not put it at the top front and center?

   Keeping his big offer lower on the page will mean the prospect has to
   scroll past all the other stuff first. This then gives the prospect a
   chance to learn more, read social proof and build confidence and trust
   in Tony and his products.

   This particular CTA is also sandwiched between two free content
   offerings - the blog/videos and the podcast. This takes the edge off
   the sales angle.

   We now switch back to yet another free content CTA with “LISTEN TO THE
   PODCAST”. This is yet another way for Tony to use content to connect
   with people:

   Screenshot of a link to Tony

   Our next up is not a CTA, but instead a quick presentation of what is
   called “TONY’S EXTENDED FAMILY":

   Screenshot of personal information about Tony Robbins on his website

   And to finish, “SIGN UP NOW” for the newsletter:

   Screenshot showing Tony Robbins

   At first glance, this is a pretty overwhelming homepage for the
   prospect.

   And in some ways, it actually might be overkill (after all, do people
   really need to know about his resort in Fiji before deciding to go to a
   seminar or sign up for coaching?).

   The takeaway: Content is KING! My Mum once told me “everyone has their
   own learning style” and we can break these down with VAKAD.

   People are either
     * Visual (pictures and videos)
     * Auditory (what they hear)
     * Kinesthetic (feeling and doing)
     * Auditory Digital (facts and figures) learners so you need to have
       something that appeals to everyoneʼs learning style, if possible.

   Everyone has all four learning styles but most people are dominant in
   one of them.

   Tony is taking my Mum’s advice on his homepage by offering different
   content mediums to match different peoples learning styles.

   Here are specific examples of how you can do it too:

   For Visual: show people case studies (Tony uses Pitbull, Hugh Jackman
   and Maria Menounos) and use videos (Tony uses his TED Talk, Netflix
   documentary and Super Soul Sunday with Oprah)

   For Auditory: give people the option to speak to someone so they can
   make a buying decision (Tony offers people a complimentary results
   coaching session)

   For Kinesthetic: show people the feeling they will get when making a
   buying decision (Tony gives people the feeling of luxury from his
   resort in Fiji and the feeling of altruism from his Tony Robbins
   Foundation)

   For Auditory Digital: present what you do in an organized way so that
   people can work things out for themselves (Tony does this by segmenting
   his email list based on his “Wheel of Life” quiz categories and sending
   them relevant, timely content where they need the most help right now)

[Tip #3] Invisible Mini-Funnels: Get More Sales By Using High Converting
Goal-Based Mini-Funnels To Show Your Website Visitors Personalized Product
Recommendations

   Remember this part of the homepage that I promised we’d talk about in
   the last tip?

   Screenshot of calls to action on Tony Robbins

   Let’s see what happens when we click one of those “LEARN MORE” buttons.

   If I click the button under the ‘business’ category, I end up on a page
   that lists business goals like “get more clients” and “reduce risk”:

   Screenshot showing a tile of different links on Tony Robbins

   If I click the Increase Revenue image, I end up in Tony’s mini
   “increase revenue” funnel (that’s even what it’s called in the URL):

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   If we move down the page, we hit the first offer: “GET A FREE COACHING
   SESSION"

   Screenshot of a call to action on Tony Robbins

   From there are a couple of CTAs to join one of Tony’s seminars or a
   business mastery class:

   Screenshot of CTAs for Tony Robbins events

   Then, we find a few product offerings that are related to the ‘business
   goal’ the prospect clicked on (“increase revenue", in this case):

   Screenshot of relevant products offered on the Tony Robbins website

   Followed up by a free trial offer:

   Screenshot of a trial CTA on Tony Robbins

   And some blog content that has been specifically tailored to the
   funnel:

   Screenshot of other articles relative to the funnel

   If you backtrack, you’ll find that there’s a special mini-funnel for
   every single one of these subcategories and goals.

   So, if you click on “Maximize Your Health” under the ‘personal life’
   subcategory, you end up here:

   Screenshot of the address bar on a Tony Robbins page

   This health funnel has its own “Unleash The Power Within” headline and
   mastery class offering:

   Screenshot of two calls to action on Tony Robbins

   Its own relevant product offerings:

   Screenshot of relevant product offerings

   And its own customized blog post offerings (although, this one section
   could use some work):

   Screenshot of a recommendation, tailored specifically to a funnel

   There are a few CTAs that stay the same no matter the funnel: the
   initial coaching call, the ‘Unleash the Power Within’ retreat and the
   free trial offer.

   Although these 3 product offerings are the same across all pages, the
   prospects will perceive them as different.

   Having prospects go through the process of first clicking on the
   specific category and goal they are interested in achieving makes all
   the content on the mini-funnel page seem like a customized, personal
   solution just for them.

   The takeaway: Give prospects a way to ‘show’ you what they are
   interested in and want to work on, then offer up what seems to be a
   personalized set of solutions (Tony uses 8 business growth mini-funnels
   and 8 personal growth mini-funnels to try and cover every business and
   personal life improvement goal people are looking to achieve)

[Tip #4] The Most Unusual Method For Converting PPC Traffic Into Product
Sales: “The Top-Level Landing Page Method”

   Here’s a look at Tony’s top performing PPC ads:

   Screenshot of Tony

   As is fitting for someone whose success is linked to his personal
   brand, the first word in each ad’s headline is Tony Robbins’ name
   itself.

   The ads also contain a blend of strong CTAs (“Order Now!” and “Change
   Your Life Today”) and elements of urgency (“Only 10 Days” and “Limited
   Time Sale”).

   But what I really want to talk about are the landing pages that these
   ads take you to.

   A quick Google search for “tony robbins blog” gives you results like
   this:

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   The first result is, obviously, one of Tony’s paid ads. The second is
   just the top organic search engine result.

   But now take a look at the landing pages for each of these search
   results.

   As is expected, the organic search result brings you directly to the
   blog as per your search intent. But the same isn’t true for the PPC ad.
   Instead of giving you the direct blog link that you searched for,
   clicking on the ad will send you to Tony’s homepage.

   A similar PPC ad and landing page sequence happens with many of Tony’s
   other branded keywords. Here is an example of what a paid branded
   keyword search funnel looks like:

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   Although most of the branded keywords in the funnel have a very
   specific search intent, like…
     * tony robbins affirmations
     * anthony robbins date with destiny
     * tony robbins blog

   These keywords don’t bring the audience to ultra-specific or
   highly-relevant landing pages that revolve around the search term.

   Instead, all of these search terms bring the prospects to somewhere
   more general: Tony’s homepage. Why?

   Why would Tony do that when Google rewards relevancy with a higher
   quality score? Why wouldn’t he keep his landing pages highly-relevant
   to their ad copy and give people a better landing page experience?

   Either Tony likes throwing money down the drain while clapping on stage
   OR he has tested driving traffic to specific landing pages vs top-level
   landing pages and top-level landing pages get him more conversions.

   One thing to remember is the massive amount of awareness the name “Tony
   Robbins” has.

   So if someone is searching with a phrase that includes Tony by name,
   they are probably interested enough that they’ll seek out their
   original search intent even if they don’t land on the relevant page
   (Luckily, Tony’s well-organized menu makes it easy for them to do
   this).

   And, as we’ve seen in our analysis of Tony’s homepage above, it has a
   lot of good things going for it: it offers plenty of enticing CTAs,
   social proof and useful free content that gives value to the readers.

   Directing prospects to Tony’s general homepage instead of a
   highly-relevant landing page makes sure prospects get exposed to all
   that first.

   This gives Tony and his team extra opportunities to get leads, promote
   other products, increase audience interest and build Tony’s credibility
   for as many visitors to the site as they can.

   You see the same technique with Tony’s PPC ads for branded product
   keywords.

   As this paid search funnel shows, instead of directing prospects to the
   product page for the specific product search, they are directed to
   Tony’s top-level general Products page which lists everything he sells.
   No matter what product the prospect actually searched for.

   Screenshot of Google ads for Tony Robbins

   To make sure the viewer can still find what they are looking for, there
   are  categories on the left side of the page for them to navigate
   through.

   Tony also applies this same technique for non-branded keywords.

   Here’s Tony’s paid search funnel for the non-branded PPC keyword “time
   management calendars”:

   Screenshot of Tony

   When a viewer clicks this ad, they are sent to Tony’s top-level
   ‘Productivity & Performance’ product page. This page features not only
   the time management calendars the prospect was searching for, but also
   some extra product offerings that fall into the same category (and
   would likely be of interest to the searcher).

   Warning: Implement this tip at your own risk. Tony has a big brand name
   and this method is unusual. In the end you need to test, thatʼs always
   the answer in the end.

   The takeaway: Test top-level PPC landing pages against specific
   product-level landing pages to see how you can maximize the amount of
   offers you put in front of your prospects. Just be very aware of your
   searcher’s awareness level with your brand and make sure they can still
   follow-through to their original search intent.

[Tip #5] The Peacock Technique: Display Your Finest Social Media Posts On
Different Social Media Platforms To Attract The Attention Of Your Biggest
Fans

   Although social media was not around back when Tony first got started,
   today it’s something that factors highly into his marketing strategy.

   Today, he has 7.9M followers across his 5 main platforms.

   Screenshot of the engagement buttons on Tony Robbins

   And 17.25% of all his website traffic comes from social media, which
   adds up to an extra 165,000 visitors monthly.

   That’s 1 website visitor for every 47 social media followers.

   Here is a breakdown of Tony’s top social media platforms:

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   So, how did Tony manage to create such an impressive following? Well,
   the fact that Tony had been well-known and famous for years beforehand
   certainly helped.

   Unlike many other businesses, they don’t just post the same content
   across all platforms. This article published on Tony’s blog gives us
   some insight into the type of content they believe do best on each
   platform.

   Let’s look at how each of Tony’s social media platforms match the
   insights given in the article.

   Facebook

   What Tony’s article says:

   “Announcements, invitations, photo galleries, videos, and longer-form
   storytelling work very well on Facebook. Any content immediately
   interesting and conversation-worthy will keep people coming back.”

   What Tony does:

   Tony uses Facebook as a platform to announce his upcoming events and
   promote his videos (both of which are located near the top of the
   page).

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   He also uses it as a way to share his blog content and offer up ‘bits
   of wisdom’ that generate conversation among his followers:

   Screenshot showing a Facebook post by Tony Robbins

   LinkedIn

   What Tony’s article says:

   “LinkedIn is a must for any business, brand or working professional —
   it’s most powerfully used as continual networking, recruiting and value
   sharing. Avoid using LinkedIn for content that is excessively personal,
   or not relevant to a business networking audience.”

   What Tony does:

   To generate LinkedIn traffic, Tony has the huge benefit of being a
   LinkedIn Influencer. This lets him publish articles directly on
   LinkedIn’s platform which exposes them to an extended audience.

   Unfortunately, becoming an official LinkedIn Influencer is done on an
   invitation-only basis. But if you play your cards right, you can still
   become an LinkedIn influencer in all but the title by publishing
   thoughtful, long-form content appropriate for the audience.

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   So of course, that means neither you nor Tony should publish just
   any type of content on LinkedIn.

   Tony stays away from posting about things that are too personal or
   irrelevant to the business-minded LinkedIn audience (even though he
   shares that type of content on his other platforms).

   Twitter

   What Tony’s article says:

   “In the realm of business, Twitter has replaced customer service as a
   first point-of-contact for both negative and positive
   experiences….Twitter is key for expanding awareness, special incentive
   offers and linking to longer-form content that add value.”

   What Tony does:

   As you can see by Tony’s cover photo, bio and pinned tweet, he
   definitely uses Twitter as a means of expanding awareness. In this
   case, for expanding awareness about his new book:

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   He also builds awareness of his personal brand and of who he is by
   retweeting content other people have written about him:

   Screenshot of a Twitter post by Tony Robbins

   And of course, he gives his followers plenty of 140-character nuggets
   of wisdom that are just perfect for getting shared around and retweeted
   with hashtags like #WednesdayWisdom and #ThursdayThoughts:

   Screenshot of two twitter posts by Tony Robbins

   Unlike many companies today, Tony does not actually use Twitter much as
   a customer service platform.

   And here are just two final insights into how Tony’s team approaches
   social media marketing, courtesy of this interview with Tony Robbins’
   marketing director, Tyler Culbertson:

   1) When it comes to social media, Tony Robbins and his team are really
   big into numbers and keeping things measurable. They know that not all
   their social media followers will convert, so they believe it’s
   important to try to track which ones are. This helps them see what
   their social media ROI looks like.

   Click here to reveal which tool Tony uses to measure his social media
   ROI.

   2) Tony doesn’t use social media as a way to generate direct sales.
   Instead, his focus is on brand building and providing his audience with
   value. In Culbertson’s words at 12:32 in the interview “you’ll never
   see Tony Robbins selling from his social media networks.”

   The takeaway: Don’t get lazy and just spread the same content across
   all your social media platforms because it’s easy. Use the 2-step
   peacock technique:
   Step 1) Research what type of content performs best on the platforms
   you use (using this article)
   Step 2) Adjust your social posts to match the social media psychology
   of people on each platform

[Tip #6] Follow Tony’s TRRCSS Sales Call Strategy To Close More Sales With
This Simple 5-Step Shortcut

   In a time when calls seem to take up a smaller and smaller slice of
   customer communication, Tony and his team stick out in the way they
   prioritize calls.

   You can see this by all the variations of the “schedule a call” or
   “speak to someone” CTA found again and again throughout the website.

   Screenshot of engagement buttons on Tony Robbins

   #1 - It’s CTA #2 on the homepage.

   #2 - It’s the CTA given after prospects finish the life assessment quiz
   on the homepage.

   #3 - It’s the main CTA for those mini-funnels we talked about in tip
   #3.

   In other words, Tony’s team really wants to get you on a call. Which
   means they continue to find that getting someone on a call is a very
   effective way to close a sale.

   To see what sort of sales pitches they were using on these phone calls,
   I signed up for one of the free coaching calls myself.

   What I was surprised to find was that they weren’t the usual sort of
   ‘pushy’ experiences generally associated with sales calls.

   This is an overview of how the call went:

   1) After I had scheduled my appointment, I received an email that
   introduced me to my coach and gave me two pieces of “homework” to
   complete before the call:

   Screenshot of the email sent after scheduling an appointment

   Clicking on STEP 1 brought me to a page all about the guy I was going
   to speak with on my call:

   Screenshot of Tony Robbins

   Clicking on the “PERSONAL OUTCOMES FORM” brought me to a short
   questionnaire that asked some general personal info plus my goals, what
   I was struggling with and what I hoped to get from the call:

   Screenshots of engagement questions to get ready for a call with a
   coach

   Once I finished this, I went back and clicked on STEP 2 in the email.
   It directed me to Tony Robbins’ famous DISC personality test:

   Screenshot of a link to the DISC personality test

   Having prospects go ahead and fill out this type of info before a call
   is a double-whammy pre-sales tactic: first, it builds up the prospect’s
   anticipation and interest, makes them think critically on what they
   need a solution for and essentially “softens them up” to accepting
   change (aka your service).

   Second, it gives the coach a direct insight into the prospect’s weak
   points and overall personality. This helps them tailor the call in a
   way that provides the prospect with value, yet also makes them more
   likely to convert.

   2) The call itself began with a friendly greeting and just a few
   general questions about who I was, where I lived, etc. The coach then
   told me a bit about himself (this was him trying to build up a
   connection and trust with me, his audience member).

   3) We then moved on to talk about and verify some of the things I had
   put into my pre-call questionnaire and personality test.

   4) After he got more big-picture specifics, we chose a single issue I
   had brought up and dug deeper into it (in this case, it was finding
   work/life balance).

   We discussed why I thought it was an issue and he offered up some
   suggestions that were actually useful and actionable. (In other words,
   the coach made sure I got some value from the call).

   5) Now came the sales pitch (though it wasn’t a sales pitch in the
   usual sense). He asked what I knew about Tony Robbins and his coaching,
   then gave me a general overview of the program. Though it wasn’t pushy
   at all, something that caught my attention was how the coach gave me
   very specific examples of how the coaching would help me with the
   specific problems we had talked about on the call.

   This is a good sales tactic for a few major reasons:
     * It makes prospects feel like they are listened to (which makes you
       more trustworthy and likeable)
     * It makes the service seem like a customized solution just for you
     * It helps prospects visualize how the service could fit into their
       lives

   The call ended without any sort of final selling attempts, and I was
   told I could contact the guy anytime if I wanted to go forth and sign
   up.

   The takeaway: Get your website visitors on the phone whenever possible.
   Once you’re on the phone with them communicate in a way that gives them
   value based on their individual goals (and doesn’t just sound like a
   script with an irritating sales pitch at the end).

Clicks From Your Ad To Your Product Page

   If there’s one thing Tony understands, it’s the power of repeated
   marketing touches and social proof to make his sales effortless.

   And one way Tony nails this is with an aggressive retargeting
   technique.

   Since I’ve begun my research several weeks ago and first ended up on
   Tony’s website, I’ve had a NON-STOP onslaught of Tony Robbins ads
   across all sorts of platforms.

   Now, obviously, retargeting is super effective or else Tony wouldn’t be
   bothering with it as much as he is.

   The benefit of retargeting ads is that they work to nurture people
   who’ve already shown interest in your website by visiting it.
   Naturally, it’s much easier to convert these ‘warm’ leads than to
   convert 100% cold prospects who are oblivious to your product
   offerings.

   Here is Tony’s 3-part Dynamic Carousel Retargeting ad I stumbled upon
   on the Google Display Network:

   With all the retargeting Tony does, one thing he has to be very careful
   about is “banner blindness.” This happens when people get sick of
   seeing the same ads over and over again to the point that they no
   longer notice them.

   This results in “ad fatigue” where the click-through rate on your ads
   start to decrease, and your cost per click starts to increase. #badnews

   Luckily, there’s an easy fix to this: change one element of the ad.

   As you can see in the banner ad below (which I found about 2 weeks
   after that pink and black one), the element Tony changed was color. It
   was an easy fix (since most of the text is the same), but one that
   definitely made me stop being “blind” to Tony’s ads and notice them
   once again:

   Screenshot of testimonials for a Tony Robbins event

   Tony makes these 3 banner ads work together by turning them into one
   dynamic ad that rotates quickly through. So, if I come across one of
   Tony’s display ads anywhere, they cycle through (as in, it’s a single
   ad that flashes through all 3 images).

   Making these images cycle through not only catches the eye more than a
   static ad, but it lets Tony use social proof to back up why prospects
   should click through to his product page (increasing his click-through
   rate and lowering his click costs).

   The first two banner ads use social proof to build trust before using
   strong, urgent language (either “don’t miss this life changing event”
   or “experience this life changing weekend”) to get people to take
   action and click.

   Even though the 3 ads may look different, they all work together to
   direct people to one place: a landing page for Tony’s “Unleash Your
   Power Within” event.

   Here’s what the landing page looks like:

   In addition to GDN ads, Tony is also investing heavily in Facebook
   retargeting ads:

   Screenshot showing two individual Facebook posts by Tony Robbins

   And you’ll even find his ads (for that very same “Unleash the Power
   Within” event) on YouTube:

   Screenshot of A Tony Robbins video, saying "Unleash The Power Within"

   Tony is leveraging retargeting everywhere he can to drive more people
   to his next big event at cost-efficient scale.

   The takeaway: The secret to maximizing your product sales is with
   extensive retargeting and a simple sales funnel. You gotta leverage
   your inbound traffic by thinking bigger with your retargeting.
   Not bigger in terms of less qualified people, mass pixeling or higher
   banner ad frequency.
   Bigger in terms of blanketing the web. When you leverage your inbound
   website traffic and are everywhere it creates a whole new effect that
   makes small budgets work like big budgets (Tony retargets his website
   traffic across the Google Display Network, Facebook and YouTube to his
   next upcoming event).

[Tip #8] The Tony Robbins Clapping Ritual: 7 Insane Rituals To Create The
Most Exciting Weekend Ever For Your Event Guests

   Tony is one of the best live event prepper’s in the world.

   People pay good money to attend Tony’s events (for “Unleash The Power
   Within” the price is anywhere from $650 to $2,995) and Tony is expected
   to deliver EVERY time.

   To see exactly how Tony delivers high-performance events for his guests
   I got my buddy Barron Cruz from Charisma Matrix to reverse engineer his
   whole 7-step pre-event ritual:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_1l7E3JgNE?rel=0

   Here is exactly what Tony does to get pumped up:
    1. Meditation
    2. 57° Fahrenheit cold plunge
    3. Warms up his voice
    4. Shoots liquid supplements into his mouth (we speculate Ginseng)
    5. Jumps on a mini-trampoline
    6. Does a classic MC Hammer spin followed by a chest pump
    7. Tony Robbins clapping ritual (watch the video to see what I mean)

   The takeaway: High-performance athletes have a ritual to guarantee they
   are always performing at their best. If you want to create the most
   exciting event ever for your event guests, get your own pre-event
   ritual.

[Tip #9] Use One Of Tony’s 3 Successful Podcast Types To Take Your Podcast
Category Ranking To The Top Of iTunes

   The Tony Robbins podcast has played a major part in Tony’s content
   marketing strategy. It’s even done well enough to claim 2nd place for
   education podcasts in iTunes (behind TEDTalks):

   Screenshot of the top podcasts on iTunes, with #2 being Tony Robbins

   Tony’s podcast episodes fall loosely into 3 main categories:

   Podcast Type #1: Guest Interviews with Experts

   The majority of Tony’s podcast episodes are ‘Type #1s.’ They provide
   interesting, insightful interviews about topics relevant to Tony’s
   audience (usually being something that fits into one of the 7
   categories from his ‘Wheel of Life’ quiz and blog post categories).

   Their purpose is to give his listeners free, “no strings attached”
   value and information. This is why, within these types of podcast
   episodes, you won’t find a single CTA directing you towards Tony’s
   product offerings.

   Interestingly enough, these interviews aren’t actually hosted by Tony
   at all. (Which is probably something he can get away with simply
   because his brand is already so big.)

   Here is an example from the ‘Health & Vitality’ category: A New
   Approach to Wellness interview with Chris Kresser

   Podcast Type #2: Tony Monologues

   These types of podcast episodes feature Tony and Tony alone. In them,
   he discusses a topic in depth.

   He seems to use these Tony-only podcasts when he wants to promote a
   specific upcoming event. In this case, he brings up the event briefly
   both before and after the main episode content. At the very end, he
   gives listeners a link they can head to for more info.

   Here is an example where Tony repurposes his super-famous TED talk to
   grow his podcast: Why We Do What We Do
   Podcast Type #3: Behind-the-Scenes Event Excerpts

   These types of podcasts are just audio excerpts from one of Tony’s
   events with a short intro and conclusion by the host. Tony’s most
   popular type #3 podcast episode was an audio clip of him coaching an
   audience member right on stage during his Date with Destiny event.

   This is a pretty smooth way of promoting his events - not only does
   Tony include enough audio in the podcast that the listener can feel
   like they learned something, but offering this little event ‘teaser’ is
   enough to make a listener curious to learn more about coming to his
   next event.

   Here is an example from Tony’s Date with Destiny event: A Look Inside
   Date with Destiny

   The takeaway: Be known for something (Tony is known for his guest
   interviews, life improvement tips and behind-the-scenes event
   excerpts). Keep some variety in your podcast episodes but have a common
   theme (Tony’s overarching theme is “life advice”).
   Don’t overload your podcast episodes with too much promotional
   material. Give your listeners helpful, high quality content and find
   smooth, relevant ways to mix in your product offerings (Tony uses his
   event excerpt content as a natural way to promote his events).

[Tip #10] The Content Multiplier Technique You Can Use To Double The Traffic
You Get For Every Article

   On its own, Tony gets impressive viewership and engagement on his blog.

   As in, enough viewership and engagement that his top 4 articles average
   out to 20k shares per article:

   Screenshot of a Buzzsumo search on Tony Robbins

   But on top of the blog Tony has on his website, Tony has also set up
   plenty of other content sources that let him reach out beyond his usual
   audience.

   These include:
     * As a guest writer on Entrepreneur.com
     * As a contributor to Arianna Huffington’s Medium publication, Thrive
       Global
     * As an exclusive influencer on LinkedIn

   Sometimes, the content he creates for the above sources is 100%
   original and won’t be found on either his blog or elsewhere. This makes
   sense as the type of content that performs best on each of these
   platforms will vary, so just because it’s performed well on one
   platform won’t necessarily translate to success in another platform.

   But in some cases, he takes advantage of the articles that he
   knows have already performed well and then repurposes them to put up on
   another one of these websites.

   This is exactly what Tony does for his #1 article in the table above.
   Here is Tony’s top article on his website: Change Your Words, Change
   Your Life

   Screenshot of a quote on Tony Robbins

   He then repurposed this same article for LinkedIn with a slightly
   updated headline that would better capture the attention of a typical
   LinkedIn user:

   Screenshot of a short article on Tony Robbins

   The takeaway: Use the content multiplier method to re-purpose and
   tailor your content for specific platforms so you can get your content
   in front of as many eyeballs as possible (Tony does this by being a
   contributor on Entrepreneur.com, Arianna Huffington’s Medium
   publication and LinkedIn).

[Tip #11] New Product Pre-Sell Strategy: Use A Welcome Mat To Collect
Thousands Of Pre-Orders For Your New Products Without Changing Your Homepage
Design

   See this:

   Screenshot of a Tony Robbins product page

   This is the EXACT strategy Tony Robbins is using to pre-sell new
   products he releases on TonyRobbins.com.

   It’s called a Welcome Mat (a section of the page that first shows when
   a new visitor comes to the website, then disappears when the visitor
   scrolls down to reveal your normal page) #superstealth

   Tony uses a welcome mat to quickly collect sales for new products
   without having to change anything on his home page and get tech geeks
   involved.

   He simply turns it on and off as he has new products he wants to
   feature on his website.

   Keenan Shaw (Tony Robbins’ Demand Generation Manager) said this tool
   helped increase their website leads by 15%.

   Click here to see which free tool Tony uses to create his Welcome Mats.

   The takeaway: Leverage the latest website technology to improve your
   website conversions (Tony does this by using a Welcome Mat to pre-sell
   his new books and other new products he releases).

11 Key Takeaways From Tony Robbinsʼ Multi-Million Dollar Marketing Strategy

   Tony Robbins is a big player in the professional training world, but
   you don’t need a sumo-sized marketing team or budget to get similar
   results.

   You just need a smart Sumo marketing plan.

   Here are the 11 key takeaways you can borrow, modify and adopt for your
   own business based on Tony Robbins real-life marketing tactics:
    1. Starting off your funnel with a lead gen quiz that follows the AIDA
       (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) formula is a powerful way to
       capture lead info and segment prospects into specific email
       automation sequences based on their response.
    2. Using multiple CTAs isn’t always a recipe for disaster as long as
       most of them are low-commitment, offer a LOT of useful free content
       and appeal to a wide range of learning styles (like Tony did by
       offering videos for the visual learners, complimentary phone calls
       for the auditory learners, etc.).
    3. People love thinking things were made just for them and your
       prospects are no exception. Find a way to get your prospects to
       “show” you what they are interested in and then give them their
       very own mini-funnel of customized product solutions.
    4. In Tony’s case, it seems that top-level PPC landing pages perform
       better than product-level landing pages. Though this is a very
       unusual (and risky) move for most businesses, it could be something
       worth testing.
    5. Spreading all your content on all your social media channels won’t
       necessarily help you. When it comes to social media, think like a
       peacock and figure out what type of content spreads best on each
       social channel.
    6. Nobody likes a sleazy car salesmen (get your prospect on a phone
       call and follow Tony’s simple goal-based sales call strategy to get
       more client enrollments for your business).
    7. Retargeting doesn’t have to be crazy expensive or crazy
       complicated. Making yourself everywhere by retargeting across
       multiple platforms with a simple sales funnel makes small budgets
       work like big budgets.
    8. If you do live events, you better get your Tony Robbins clapping
       ritual and MC hammer spin on point. High-energy events that command
       your audience’s attention need a presenter who is going to control
       the room. Great speakers have rituals that pump them and the
       audience up.
    9. Podcasts are a super effective way to generate more awareness and
       traffic for you or your website if you offer listeners lots of
       interesting, high quality and helpful content. But don’t just jump
       in like a newb, decide what you’re going to be known for and only
       slip in your promotional material when it can be done smoothly and
       naturally.
   10. The more people that are exposed to your content, the better. Use
       the content multiplier method Tony uses to help you spread,
       re-purpose, and customize your content across different platforms.
   11. There is always new technology coming out that can help you get
       more website conversions.
