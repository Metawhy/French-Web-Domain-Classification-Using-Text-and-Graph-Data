   Big Data, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, agile, social management,
   distance networking, etc. These are increasingly sought after skills.

   In the near future their impact will become ever stronger. As a result,
   they will in turn affect training. Steve Dineen has simplified some of
   the main impacts we will see.

The YouTube effect

   The widespread passion for the use of online videos has also permeated
   the world of education. However, we need to be careful that the videos
   are not only concise, pleasing and attractive (like most viral social
   media videos) but also able to impart learning.

The main tool is the smartphone

   Habits have changed. We all try to use our smartphones as multi-purpose
   tools. It is therefore necessary to accept that training content and
   formats always need to be manageable in mobile form too.

The “beauty of change”

   This constant need for change stems from a management vision that is
   clearly financially-driven.

Use information

   Data is a Game Changer. We live in a world where most online
   interactions as well as access to management, purchasing and supply
   processes are traceable. These are information universes that should be
   recognised as being fundamental sources for training analysis.

If the world changes, so do skills

   The basic training skills remain the same but technological changes
   require the introduction of new specialist skills. It is not a question
   of adding a young social media expert to training teams. This would be
   meaningless. Instead, it is a question of reflecting on which typical
   skills taught through training should be imparted via new interactive
   forms (from analysis to design).

Sponsorship is necessary

   The involvement of C-level executives is no longer simply an option, it
   has become something essential. The involvement, both in the ‘emergence
   of training need’ phase and in the ‘promotion of training initiatives’
   phase, must involve the active contribution of management.

Technology is the tool, not the goal

   Technology in training must aid learning or professional skills, not be
   a skill taught for the use of the technology itself.

   How then can we go ahead in concrete terms? It is a matter of
   respecting some design aspects typical of advanced training in the best
   possible way.
   Here are the main ones:

    1. Remember the purpose of the training. Training is intended to
       produce learning and this must be correlated with the business
       prospects of the company.
    2. Training has always been designed as a learning experience. Let’s
       continue with this idea, remembering to understand the meaning and
       sense of the experience from the user’s perspective.
    3. Training needs to be designed as if it were a project. We need to
       start from the strategic business perspectives, explore the
       available information and make assumptions about the operational
       scenario. We need to avoid working in routine ways.
