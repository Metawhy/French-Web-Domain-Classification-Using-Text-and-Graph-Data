1 in 16 U.S. women say their first sexual intercourse was rape

   Health

   Sep 16, 2019 2:52 PM EDT

   A staggering one in 16 women said they were raped by force or coercion
   the first time they had sexual intercourse, according to a new study of
   government survey data.

   Survivors reported higher rates of unwanted first pregnancy, abortion
   and an array of other physical and mental health problems, study
   authors wrote in an analysis published Monday in the Journal of the
   American Medical Association.

What does the study say?

   Between 2011 and 2017, researchers for the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention questioned a nationally representative sample of 13,310
   women, ages 18 to 44 about marriage, divorce, family life, reproductive
   health and more. Men were not asked about the first time they had
   sexual intercourse, and women with no history of vaginal intercourse
   and girls 17 or younger were not included in this study.

   Among women who responded, 6.5 percent said their first time having sex
   was forced upon them. That equates to an estimated 3.3 million women
   nationwide. If the survey had included girls younger than 17 or women
   older than 45, “certainly that absolute number would be higher,” said
   Laura Hawks, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Healthcare for the
   Homeless and the study’s lead author.
   “Quite honestly, that’s the tip of the iceberg.”

   “Quite honestly, that’s the tip of the iceberg,” said Hawks, who is
   also a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.

   The trauma of this first sexual experience left a legacy of negative
   health outcomes for survivors, the study suggested. Among these survey
   respondents, 30 percent of women reported an unwanted first-time
   pregnancy, compared to 18 percent of women who said they chose to have
   sex the first time.

   Women who were forced to have sex the first time were also more likely
   to report having had an abortion and have had problems ovulating or
   menstruating, significantly higher than women who described their first
   sexual experience as consensual.

   Often, the sexual violence happened when the women were girls. Among
   respondents, 7 percent said they were younger than 10 at the time of
   the assault, while another 29 percent said they were between the ages
   of 11 and 14. The largest segment, at 39 percent, said the assaults
   happened between the ages of 15 and 17.

   While women of all racial and socioeconomic groups reported these
   assualts, women of color and women in poverty reported higher rates of
   first-time forced sex.

Why is this important?

   One out of five women and one out of 71 men will be raped in their
   lifetime, according to the CDC’s 2010 National Intimate Partner and
   Sexual Violence Survey. Among those who had been raped, 81 percent of
   women and 35 percent men reported post-traumatic stress disorder of
   varying duration, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource
   Center.

   These first-time experiences are important for physicians to understand
   and monitor with trauma-informed care, Hawks said. This includes
   requesting permission to ask difficult questions and being sensitive
   when performing any genital exams.

   “Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past,” Hawks said.

   A patient’s exposure to sexual violence “needs to be top of mind for
   medical professionals, particularly those serving teenagers and young
   adults, said said Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse and
   Incest National Network.
   “Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past.”

   Nearly half of all victims of sexual violence who call RAINN’s national
   hotline are under age 18, Berkowitz said. Younger people are at greater
   risk and while there is no guaranteed prevention he said there are
   steps children and young adults can take to lower risk.

   Caregivers can empower their children to speak out by discussing
   personal boundaries so children know what kinds of behavior are
   appropriate. It is also important for parents to reassure their child
   that if someone ever mistreats them, the parent or caregiver remains a
   safe person for the child to talk to.

   If an act of sexual violence has already occurred, Berkowitz said
   family and friends should be supportive, let the victim lead the
   conversation, and remember that the “reaction of the first person they
   tell is going to have a big effect on everything that happens next, on
   their healing process, how long it takes, or whether or not they report
   to police.”

   If you have been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault
   Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673), available 24 hours, seven days a week.
   You will be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault
   service provider in your area.

   By Associated Press
   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeatedly prodded Ukraine's
   new leader to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy
   Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according
   to a rough transcript summarizing the call released Wednesday. In the
   call, Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the
   former vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor's
   investigation of his son Hunter. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's
   son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to
   find out about that," Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy. The conversation between the two leaders is one piece of a
   whistleblower's complaint, which followed the July 25 call. The
   complaint is central to the formal impeachment inquiry launched Tuesday
   by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House account of the call
   reveals that Trump was willing to engage a foreign leader to dig up
   dirt on a political foe and he goes so far as to volunteer his attorney
   general to help. But Trump appears to stop short in the call of any
   explicit quid pro quo, such as linking Ukraine's help to American
   military aid or other assistance. Days before the call, Trump froze
   nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. It was not clear from the
   summary whether Zelenskiy was aware of that. The president has insisted
   he did nothing wrong and has denied that any request for help was tied
   to the aid freeze. It's illegal under federal law to seek foreign
   government assistance for U.S. elections. The release of the rough
   transcript sets the parameters of the political debate to come. Trump,
   at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said as he often does that's
   he's the victim of "the single greatest witch hunt in American
   history." Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the congressional
   impeachment inquiry. Trump aides believed that his oblique,
   message-by-suggestion style of speaking would not lend itself to the
   discovery of a "smoking gun" in Wednesday's summary. His previous
   messages to his staff were at the center of special counsel Robert
   Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia
   case. One example in the summary: Trump says to Zelenskiy, "I would
   like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been
   through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." In the conversation,
   Trump doesn't distinguish between the roles of Giuliani, his personal
   attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as the nation's top law
   enforcement officer is supposed to be above the political fray. Barr
   has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably during the Mueller
   investigation. "Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, he was the
   mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call
   you," Trump said, according to the call summary. "I will ask him to
   call you along with the attorney general." Immediately after saying
   Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine's
   economy, saying: "Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country." It's not the
   first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to undermine a political
   rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing Hillary Clinton emails
   in 2016, but this is his first documented time doing so while president
   with the weight of the U.S. government at his disposal. The president
   took the 30-minute call from the White House residence, while officials
   in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record of the
   conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice recognition
   software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the document
   declassified Tuesday. The release came against the backdrop of the
   president presiding over a meeting of world leaders at the United
   Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump
   era. The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine's leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said. The whistleblower — a member of the
   intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard
   the information from "White House officials," but did not have
   firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.
   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department's policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said. The official spoke on
   condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal investigative
   deliberations. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the
   attorney general was first notified of Trump's conversation with the
   Ukrainian president "several weeks after the call took place," when the
   department received the referral about potential criminal conduct. "The
   president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine
   investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his
   son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter," the spokeswoman said. Trump
   has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption
   that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a
   Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
   Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint,
   but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has
   refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is
   to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to
   have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified
   setting. The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American
   political events, leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from
   fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry. Trump, who thrives on
   combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this step, confident that
   the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party will bolster
   rather than diminish his political support. ___ Associated Press

   100 Amazing Facts About the Negro

How Many Slaves Landed in the U.S.?

   by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. | Originally posted on The Root

   Perhaps you, like me, were raised essentially to think of the slave
   experience primarily in terms of our black ancestors here in the United
   States. In other words, slavery was primarily about us, right, from
   Crispus Attucks and Phillis Wheatley, Benjamin Banneker and Richard
   Allen, all the way to Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth and Frederick
   Douglass. Think of this as an instance of what we might think of
   as African-American exceptionalism. (In other words, if it’s in “the
   black Experience,” it’s got to be about black Americans.) Well, think
   again.

   The most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of
   the slave trade is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, edited by
   professors David Eltis and David Richardson. (While the editors are
   careful to say that all of their figures are estimates, I believe that
   they are the best estimates that we have, the proverbial “gold
   standard” in the field of the study of the slave trade.) Between 1525
   and 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World,
   according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database,
   12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World. 10.7 million
   survived the dreaded Middle Passage, disembarking in North America, the
   Caribbean and South America.

   And how many of these 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to
   North America? Only about 388,000. That’s right: a tiny percentage.

1 in 16 U.S. women say their first sexual intercourse was rape

   Health

   Sep 16, 2019 2:52 PM EDT

   A staggering one in 16 women said they were raped by force or coercion
   the first time they had sexual intercourse, according to a new study of
   government survey data.

   Survivors reported higher rates of unwanted first pregnancy, abortion
   and an array of other physical and mental health problems, study
   authors wrote in an analysis published Monday in the Journal of the
   American Medical Association.

What does the study say?

   Between 2011 and 2017, researchers for the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention questioned a nationally representative sample of 13,310
   women, ages 18 to 44 about marriage, divorce, family life, reproductive
   health and more. Men were not asked about the first time they had
   sexual intercourse, and women with no history of vaginal intercourse
   and girls 17 or younger were not included in this study.

   Among women who responded, 6.5 percent said their first time having sex
   was forced upon them. That equates to an estimated 3.3 million women
   nationwide. If the survey had included girls younger than 17 or women
   older than 45, “certainly that absolute number would be higher,” said
   Laura Hawks, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Healthcare for the
   Homeless and the study’s lead author.
   “Quite honestly, that’s the tip of the iceberg.”

   “Quite honestly, that’s the tip of the iceberg,” said Hawks, who is
   also a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.

   The trauma of this first sexual experience left a legacy of negative
   health outcomes for survivors, the study suggested. Among these survey
   respondents, 30 percent of women reported an unwanted first-time
   pregnancy, compared to 18 percent of women who said they chose to have
   sex the first time.

   Women who were forced to have sex the first time were also more likely
   to report having had an abortion and have had problems ovulating or
   menstruating, significantly higher than women who described their first
   sexual experience as consensual.

   Often, the sexual violence happened when the women were girls. Among
   respondents, 7 percent said they were younger than 10 at the time of
   the assault, while another 29 percent said they were between the ages
   of 11 and 14. The largest segment, at 39 percent, said the assaults
   happened between the ages of 15 and 17.

   While women of all racial and socioeconomic groups reported these
   assualts, women of color and women in poverty reported higher rates of
   first-time forced sex.

Why is this important?

   One out of five women and one out of 71 men will be raped in their
   lifetime, according to the CDC’s 2010 National Intimate Partner and
   Sexual Violence Survey. Among those who had been raped, 81 percent of
   women and 35 percent men reported post-traumatic stress disorder of
   varying duration, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource
   Center.

   These first-time experiences are important for physicians to understand
   and monitor with trauma-informed care, Hawks said. This includes
   requesting permission to ask difficult questions and being sensitive
   when performing any genital exams.

   “Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past,” Hawks said.

   A patient’s exposure to sexual violence “needs to be top of mind for
   medical professionals, particularly those serving teenagers and young
   adults, said said Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse and
   Incest National Network.
   “Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past.”

   Nearly half of all victims of sexual violence who call RAINN’s national
   hotline are under age 18, Berkowitz said. Younger people are at greater
   risk and while there is no guaranteed prevention he said there are
   steps children and young adults can take to lower risk.

   Caregivers can empower their children to speak out by discussing
   personal boundaries so children know what kinds of behavior are
   appropriate. It is also important for parents to reassure their child
   that if someone ever mistreats them, the parent or caregiver remains a
   safe person for the child to talk to.

   If an act of sexual violence has already occurred, Berkowitz said
   family and friends should be supportive, let the victim lead the
   conversation, and remember that the “reaction of the first person they
   tell is going to have a big effect on everything that happens next, on
   their healing process, how long it takes, or whether or not they report
   to police.”

   If you have been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault
   Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673), available 24 hours, seven days a week.
   You will be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault
   service provider in your area.

   By Associated Press
   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeatedly prodded Ukraine's
   new leader to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy
   Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according
   to a rough transcript summarizing the call released Wednesday. In the
   call, Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the
   former vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor's
   investigation of his son Hunter. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's
   son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to
   find out about that," Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy. The conversation between the two leaders is one piece of a
   whistleblower's complaint, which followed the July 25 call. The
   complaint is central to the formal impeachment inquiry launched Tuesday
   by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House account of the call
   reveals that Trump was willing to engage a foreign leader to dig up
   dirt on a political foe and he goes so far as to volunteer his attorney
   general to help. But Trump appears to stop short in the call of any
   explicit quid pro quo, such as linking Ukraine's help to American
   military aid or other assistance. Days before the call, Trump froze
   nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. It was not clear from the
   summary whether Zelenskiy was aware of that. The president has insisted
   he did nothing wrong and has denied that any request for help was tied
   to the aid freeze. It's illegal under federal law to seek foreign
   government assistance for U.S. elections. The release of the rough
   transcript sets the parameters of the political debate to come. Trump,
   at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said as he often does that's
   he's the victim of "the single greatest witch hunt in American
   history." Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the congressional
   impeachment inquiry. Trump aides believed that his oblique,
   message-by-suggestion style of speaking would not lend itself to the
   discovery of a "smoking gun" in Wednesday's summary. His previous
   messages to his staff were at the center of special counsel Robert
   Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia
   case. One example in the summary: Trump says to Zelenskiy, "I would
   like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been
   through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." In the conversation,
   Trump doesn't distinguish between the roles of Giuliani, his personal
   attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as the nation's top law
   enforcement officer is supposed to be above the political fray. Barr
   has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably during the Mueller
   investigation. "Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, he was the
   mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call
   you," Trump said, according to the call summary. "I will ask him to
   call you along with the attorney general." Immediately after saying
   Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine's
   economy, saying: "Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country." It's not the
   first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to undermine a political
   rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing Hillary Clinton emails
   in 2016, but this is his first documented time doing so while president
   with the weight of the U.S. government at his disposal. The president
   took the 30-minute call from the White House residence, while officials
   in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record of the
   conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice recognition
   software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the document
   declassified Tuesday. The release came against the backdrop of the
   president presiding over a meeting of world leaders at the United
   Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump
   era. The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine's leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said. The whistleblower — a member of the
   intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard
   the information from "White House officials," but did not have
   firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.
   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department's policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said. The official spoke on
   condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal investigative
   deliberations. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the
   attorney general was first notified of Trump's conversation with the
   Ukrainian president "several weeks after the call took place," when the
   department received the referral about potential criminal conduct. "The
   president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine
   investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his
   son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter," the spokeswoman said. Trump
   has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption
   that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a
   Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
   Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint,
   but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has
   refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is
   to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to
   have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified
   setting. The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American
   political events, leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from
   fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry. Trump, who thrives on
   combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this step, confident that
   the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party will bolster
   rather than diminish his political support. ___ Associated Press

   100 Amazing Facts About the Negro

How Many Slaves Landed in the U.S.?

   by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. | Originally posted on The Root

   Perhaps you, like me, were raised essentially to think of the slave
   experience primarily in terms of our black ancestors here in the United
   States. In other words, slavery was primarily about us, right, from
   Crispus Attucks and Phillis Wheatley, Benjamin Banneker and Richard
   Allen, all the way to Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth and Frederick
   Douglass. Think of this as an instance of what we might think of
   as African-American exceptionalism. (In other words, if it’s in “the
   black Experience,” it’s got to be about black Americans.) Well, think
   again.

   The most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of
   the slave trade is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, edited by
   professors David Eltis and David Richardson. (While the editors are
   careful to say that all of their figures are estimates, I believe that
   they are the best estimates that we have, the proverbial “gold
   standard” in the field of the study of the slave trade.) Between 1525
   and 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World,
   according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database,
   12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World. 10.7 million
   survived the dreaded Middle Passage, disembarking in North America, the
   Caribbean and South America.

   And how many of these 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to
   North America? Only about 388,000. That’s right: a tiny percentage.

   Transcript Audio

   Residents of Guayama, home to Puerto Rico’s only coal-burning power
   plant for 15 years, have been diagnosed with cancer, heart and
   respiratory diseases that they fear are related to coal ash exposure.
   Ivette Feliciano reports on the concerns of Puerto Ricans who say the
   situation grew worse after Hurricane Maria--and the national
   implications as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls back
   regulations on the disposal of coal ash.

Read the Full Transcript

     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       The city of Guayama sits near Puerto Rico's southeast coast. Half
       its population of more than twenty thousand lives below the poverty
       line. Like most of Puerto Rico, the city was hit hard by Hurricane
       Maria last fall. It's still trying to recover.
       But the people here have problems beyond poverty and storm damage.
     * ALBERTO COLON:
       The next house, the man died of cancer…
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Alberto Colon is a retired maintenance worker in Miramar, one of
       the city's poorer neighborhoods. He suffers from sinusitis and has
       developed an abscess on his chest.
       Down the street from his house, a truck pulls away from a home
       where it has delivered medical supplies. Colon says, that's a
       common sight here.
     * ALBERTO COLON:
       People complain about diseases like asthma, cancer. It's normal for
       people to have cancer. Before a certain point, if a person here got
       cancer you would say: "My God, this person has cancer!" Today, you
       see them as just one more person.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Colon believes he knows the source of his neighborhood's suffering.
       Miramar sits downwind from Puerto Rico's only coal-burning power
       plant—and a 120 foot-high mound of an industrial product the plant
       generates by burning coal. It's called Agremax.
       Agremax consists mostly of coal ash. Residents here say the wind
       carries ash residue from the mound into their community.
       Alberto colon's wife, Margarita Perez, says their home's surfaces
       are covered in a thin layer of ash residue.
     * MARGARITA PEREZ:
       This right here? I just cleaned it. Look!
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Her sister, Natividad Perez Burgos—who also lives in the
       neighborhood—was diagnosed with cancer in both her lungs and her
       liver five years ago. And she suffers from skin lesions on her
       torso.
     * NATIVIDAD PEREZ BURGOS:
       It's not easy, to be told that you have cancer. You think you're
       going to die, that cancer means death. I'm fighting harder now
       because I'm not the only one who's been hurt in my community.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       According to a recent survey by the University of Puerto Rico's
       School of Public Health, almost one in ten people in the community
       have been diagnosed with cancer. One in four have a respiratory
       disease. And more than one half have heart disease.
     * ELIAS SOSTRE:
       We handle the operation of the plant. We are in direct contact with
       the pro– with the coal combustion products on a daily basis. I have
       been working in the plant for 16 years, as have many of my
       co-workers. And– we– we are– we are healthy.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Elias Sostre is operations manager at the coal plant, which is
       owned by AES, an energy company based in Virginia. Since it began
       operations in 2002, the plant has supplied nearly twenty percent of
       Puerto Rico's electricity.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       And according to an audit by the Puerto Rican government, the AES
       plant saved the island more than 500 million dollars in its first
       five years alone. Sostre says it's also a model of environmental
       efficiency.
     * ELIAS SOSTRE:
       We got here the best available technology to produce power, and to
       do so with the lowest emissions. At the time that we went online,
       we set the standard for the lowest emissions.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       For more than a decade, the number of Guayama cancer cases hovered
       at about 100 per year. But within a year of the plant's 2002
       opening, the number of cases rose by nearly 50%. The most recent
       figures show that new cancer cases have stayed near that level,
       spiking even higher in 2013.
       From the start, the company was producing Agremax from coal ash.
       Coal ash has trace amounts of heavy metals including arsenic,
       chromium, and mercury–substances that can become hazardous if there
       is enough present.
       According to AES, the plant produces 220-thousand tons of coal ash
       a year.
       But in the company's original contract with Puerto Rico's electric
       authority, the ash could not be stored on the island, unless it had
       a beneficial commercial use–which it did.
       The plant mixed coal ash with water to create Agremax, that
       concrete-like material that sits outside the plant. AES marketed
       Agremax for use in Puerto Rican roads and construction, among other
       things.
       According to the EPA, over two million tons of the material was
       used in thirty-three sites on the island between 2004 and 2012.
       Dr. Gerson Jimenez Castañón is the medical director for Menonita
       medical center, the only hospital in Puerto Rico's southeast
       region. He says he began to see a higher influx of patients two to
       three years after the coal-burning plant was built.
     * DR. GERSON JIMÉNEZ:
       We were seeing patients coming in with more respiratory
       problems—and not just respiratory problems, but each time it was
       more serious.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Did you immediately connect that change to the plant, was that
       something that you assumed was happening?
     * DR. GERSON JIMÉNEZ:
       Yes, yes, I did make the connection. As I saw it, only one new
       thing had come here. Many of the other plants had already closed
       and that was the only new one.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       But despite the anecdotal evidence, there's no proven link between
       coal ash and Guayama's health problems. And the U.S. government has
       done no definitive study regarding coal ash's potential effects on
       human health.
       A 2014 Environmental Protection Agency ruling regulated coal ash as
       non-hazardous solid waste. But environmental groups decried the
       ruling. The New York Times called it "a victory for electric
       utility companies and the coal industry."
       Just a year before, a University of Illinois study linked coal ash
       to increases in asthma and lung cancer. Another, published in 2014
       by the advocacy groups Earthjustice and Physicians for Social
       Justice, linked the material to increases in heart and respiratory
       diseases, cancer, and stroke.
       By that time AES had stopped marketing Agremax. But it does still
       convert coal ash into Agremax in order to legally dispose of it in
       approved landfills on the island.
       Alberto Colon says you can still see coal dust from Agremax where
       it was used as a filler on dirt roads.
     * ALBERTO COLON:
       Right now we have the roads here that are filled in with it so much
       that once they become dry, you can see the ash moving freely on the
       surface, blowing around. That same ash is going from the road into
       the air and it will eventually go to the water where it will
       contaminate the aquifer.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Local fear of contamination from the coal ash has become so
       widespread that protesters have gathered along the roads when the
       material is shipped from the plant. The government has employed
       police in riot gear to protect the trucks transporting Agremax.
       Dr. Luis Bonilla Soto, an environmental researcher from the
       University of Puerto Rico School of Public Health, says protesters'
       fears may be justified. He says that Agremax could contaminate
       ground water at sites where it was used–especially after an event
       like Hurricane Maria.
     * DR. LUIS BONILLA SOTO:
       María was the strongest hurricane to hit the island, it brought
       intense rains. In a few weeks fifteen inches of rain fell and,
       obviously, all those heavy metals that are in the ash are soluble
       in water. The rain gets into the ash, and it leaches through the
       subsoil and pollutes the aquifer.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       As evidence, Bonilla points to a 2012 EPA-commissioned analysis of
       Agremax by Vanderbilt University. It found that, when exposed to
       water, Agremax has the potential to leach substances such as
       arsenic, boron, chloride, and chromium at over a hundred times the
       levels the EPA considers acceptable for drinking water.
       In a statement to NewsHour Weekend, the EPA said the study "did not
       assess the health effects of Agremax" itself, and "the only
       conclusion that should be drawn from the sampling analysis report
       is that contaminants can leach from this material at these levels
       under certain conditions."
       Elias Sostre, the coal plant operations manager, says the EPA
       report has been used by environmental and health advocates to stoke
       unjustified fears.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Tania Vazquez Rivera agrees. She heads Puerto Rico's Environmental
       Quality Board. Vazquez says the EQB has offered to hold events to
       discuss Agremax with the public.
     * TANIA VAZQUEZ RIVERA:
       We actually told the people, "We can go to a scientific forum with
       scientific data and explain it." We don't want more incorrect
       information over there creatin'—creating panic to people that
       already—if you have somebody that's sick in your house and somebody
       tells you to– who to blame, you know, you g—really gonna be
       passionate about it.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Vazquez points out that Guayama had been an industrial center for
       decades before AES arrived. She says that any number of substances
       from former and current plants and factories could play a role in
       the health problems facing people there.
       She notes that just a mile and a half away from Alberto Colon's
       neighborhood of Miramar are two pharmaceutical plants and a
       superfund site that has been operating since 1999.
       Vazquez also says that AES consistently sends her agency
       measurements of coal ash components and that up to now, they've
       always stayed within the EQB's safety standards.
     * TANIA VAZQUEZ RIVERA:
       They never were out of range. So they were complying with it all
       the time.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Those tests haven't convinced, Dr. Gerson Jimenez. He says he has
       petitioned the Puerto Rican government to do a study on the effects
       of coal ash from the AES plant, but to no avail.
     * DR. GERSON JIMÉNEZ:
       I have participated in at least eight or nine public hearings of
       the Puerto Rican legislature. I've written to them and others about
       the problem and risk that this plant represents. I even asked on
       several occasions that the Department of Health or the government
       do a scientific study on the higher incidences of these cases and
       they have not done anything despite all the information that we
       have provided them with about the problems this causes.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       New findings have added fuel to the debate over coal ash. Last
       month AES released its most recent groundwater monitoring report.
       It showed that between September 12th and October 4th of last year,
       levels of arsenic, chromium, and even two radioactive isotopes had
       increased dramatically in groundwater near the coal plant's large
       mound of Agremax.
       That increase took place around the time Hurricane Maria hit the
       island. The Environmental Quality Board had ordered AES to cover
       the Agremax pile before the storm, but the company did not comply.
       The board later fined AES. The company is contesting the fine.
     * ELIAS SOSTRE:
       This is a concrete-like—product. It was—it was not necessary to
       co—to cover the pile. And the fact is that after a category—a
       category five hurricane coming by island, the pile was in the same
       shape, way and form before and after the hurricane. So our—our
       position was validated.
     * IVETTE FELICIANO:
       Puerto Rico's Environmental Quality Board has ordered AES to send
       it more information on its latest groundwater readings, and the
       company says it has complied. The EQB is now reviewing that
       information.
       Meanwhile, back in the Miramar neighborhood in Guayama, locals
       gather to discuss their concerns about the coal ash–and their
       neighborhood's future.
     * NATIVIDAD PEREZ BURGOS:
       I think about my grandchildren and I think about the suffering that
       these people have gone through. They need to do something.
       Investigate, check the environment. Because now it is our people
       but tomorrow it could be theirs because we are on the same island.
       It does not just affect Guayama, it affects all of Puerto Rico.

   By Associated Press
   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeatedly prodded Ukraine's
   new leader to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy
   Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according
   to a rough transcript summarizing the call released Wednesday. In the
   call, Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the
   former vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor's
   investigation of his son Hunter. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's
   son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to
   find out about that," Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy. The conversation between the two leaders is one piece of a
   whistleblower's complaint, which followed the July 25 call. The
   complaint is central to the formal impeachment inquiry launched Tuesday
   by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House account of the call
   reveals that Trump was willing to engage a foreign leader to dig up
   dirt on a political foe and he goes so far as to volunteer his attorney
   general to help. But Trump appears to stop short in the call of any
   explicit quid pro quo, such as linking Ukraine's help to American
   military aid or other assistance. Days before the call, Trump froze
   nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. It was not clear from the
   summary whether Zelenskiy was aware of that. The president has insisted
   he did nothing wrong and has denied that any request for help was tied
   to the aid freeze. It's illegal under federal law to seek foreign
   government assistance for U.S. elections. The release of the rough
   transcript sets the parameters of the political debate to come. Trump,
   at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said as he often does that's
   he's the victim of "the single greatest witch hunt in American
   history." Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the congressional
   impeachment inquiry. Trump aides believed that his oblique,
   message-by-suggestion style of speaking would not lend itself to the
   discovery of a "smoking gun" in Wednesday's summary. His previous
   messages to his staff were at the center of special counsel Robert
   Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia
   case. One example in the summary: Trump says to Zelenskiy, "I would
   like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been
   through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." In the conversation,
   Trump doesn't distinguish between the roles of Giuliani, his personal
   attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as the nation's top law
   enforcement officer is supposed to be above the political fray. Barr
   has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably during the Mueller
   investigation. "Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, he was the
   mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call
   you," Trump said, according to the call summary. "I will ask him to
   call you along with the attorney general." Immediately after saying
   Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine's
   economy, saying: "Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country." It's not the
   first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to undermine a political
   rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing Hillary Clinton emails
   in 2016, but this is his first documented time doing so while president
   with the weight of the U.S. government at his disposal. The president
   took the 30-minute call from the White House residence, while officials
   in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record of the
   conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice recognition
   software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the document
   declassified Tuesday. The release came against the backdrop of the
   president presiding over a meeting of world leaders at the United
   Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump
   era. The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine's leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said. The whistleblower — a member of the
   intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard
   the information from "White House officials," but did not have
   firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.
   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department's policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said. The official spoke on
   condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal investigative
   deliberations. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the
   attorney general was first notified of Trump's conversation with the
   Ukrainian president "several weeks after the call took place," when the
   department received the referral about potential criminal conduct. "The
   president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine
   investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his
   son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter," the spokeswoman said. Trump
   has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption
   that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a
   Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
   Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint,
   but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has
   refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is
   to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to
   have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified
   setting. The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American
   political events, leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from
   fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry. Trump, who thrives on
   combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this step, confident that
   the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party will bolster
   rather than diminish his political support. ___ Associated Press

New Puerto Rico governor pledges to scrutinize all contracts

   Nation

   Aug 12, 2019 10:15 AM EDT

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s new governor says her
   administration will be evaluating all government contracts as anger
   still simmers across the U.S. territory after corruption and
   mismanagement of public funds led to the recent ouster of the island’s
   former leader.

   In one of her first moves as governor, Wanda Vázquez announced late
   Sunday that she was suspending a pending $450,000 contract that is part
   of the program to rebuild and strengthen the island’s power grid, which
   was destroyed by Hurricane Maria nearly two years ago.

   “There is no room in this administration for unreasonable expenses,”
   said Vázquez, who on Wednesday became Puerto Rico’s third governor in a
   week following popular protests that resulted in political turmoil.

   Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is more than $9 billion
   in debt, had been expected to sign the contract with Stantec, a
   consulting firm based in Canada. Vázquez did not explain why she was
   suspending the deal, saying only that transparency is a priority for
   her administration.

   However, a power company spokesman emailed a statement to The
   Associated Press saying that PREPA executive director José Ortiz
   planned to meet with Vázquez on Monday to explain why it was important
   to sign the contract. Ortiz said the contract has to be submitted
   before Oct. 6 so the U.S. territory can obtain federal hurricane
   recovery funds.

   A Stantec official based in Puerto Rico did not respond to a request
   for comment.

   It is unclear whether Vázquez’s move will delay efforts to rebuild and
   bolster the power grid, which remains fragile and is prone to outages
   that have exasperated many of the island’s 3.2 million people. Power
   company spokesman Jorge Burgos said that he had no further details and
   that more information would be released after Monday’s meeting.

   Puerto Rico’s power company has awarded several multimillion-dollar
   contracts since the Category 4 storm hit on Sept. 20, 2017, and many of
   those deals have come under intense scrutiny, with some being
   cancelled. Currently, Mammoth Energy Services’ subsidiary Cobra
   Acquisitions, which has some $1.8 billion in contracts with the power
   company, is facing a federal investigation.

   Economist José Caraballo said he hopes Vázquez’s announcement is the
   first of more changes to come.

   “I hope this isn’t a smoke screen and that there’s a real audit,” he
   said in a phone interview. “That’s what all these people who have lost
   trust in the government expect.”

   Puerto Rico has been mired in political turmoil, with former Gov.
   Ricardo Rosselló resigning Aug. 2 following large protests. The
   island’s Supreme Court then ruled that his replacement was illegally
   sworn in, which left Vázquez, the justice secretary, next in line to
   become governor. The U.S. territory also is struggling to emerge from a
   13-year recession and trying to restructure some of its more than $70
   billion public debt load.

   By Associated Press
   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeatedly prodded Ukraine's
   new leader to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy
   Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according
   to a rough transcript summarizing the call released Wednesday. In the
   call, Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the
   former vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor's
   investigation of his son Hunter. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's
   son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to
   find out about that," Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy. The conversation between the two leaders is one piece of a
   whistleblower's complaint, which followed the July 25 call. The
   complaint is central to the formal impeachment inquiry launched Tuesday
   by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House account of the call
   reveals that Trump was willing to engage a foreign leader to dig up
   dirt on a political foe and he goes so far as to volunteer his attorney
   general to help. But Trump appears to stop short in the call of any
   explicit quid pro quo, such as linking Ukraine's help to American
   military aid or other assistance. Days before the call, Trump froze
   nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. It was not clear from the
   summary whether Zelenskiy was aware of that. The president has insisted
   he did nothing wrong and has denied that any request for help was tied
   to the aid freeze. It's illegal under federal law to seek foreign
   government assistance for U.S. elections. The release of the rough
   transcript sets the parameters of the political debate to come. Trump,
   at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said as he often does that's
   he's the victim of "the single greatest witch hunt in American
   history." Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the congressional
   impeachment inquiry. Trump aides believed that his oblique,
   message-by-suggestion style of speaking would not lend itself to the
   discovery of a "smoking gun" in Wednesday's summary. His previous
   messages to his staff were at the center of special counsel Robert
   Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia
   case. One example in the summary: Trump says to Zelenskiy, "I would
   like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been
   through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." In the conversation,
   Trump doesn't distinguish between the roles of Giuliani, his personal
   attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as the nation's top law
   enforcement officer is supposed to be above the political fray. Barr
   has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably during the Mueller
   investigation. "Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, he was the
   mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call
   you," Trump said, according to the call summary. "I will ask him to
   call you along with the attorney general." Immediately after saying
   Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine's
   economy, saying: "Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country." It's not the
   first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to undermine a political
   rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing Hillary Clinton emails
   in 2016, but this is his first documented time doing so while president
   with the weight of the U.S. government at his disposal. The president
   took the 30-minute call from the White House residence, while officials
   in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record of the
   conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice recognition
   software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the document
   declassified Tuesday. The release came against the backdrop of the
   president presiding over a meeting of world leaders at the United
   Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump
   era. The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine's leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said. The whistleblower — a member of the
   intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard
   the information from "White House officials," but did not have
   firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.
   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department's policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said. The official spoke on
   condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal investigative
   deliberations. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the
   attorney general was first notified of Trump's conversation with the
   Ukrainian president "several weeks after the call took place," when the
   department received the referral about potential criminal conduct. "The
   president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine
   investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his
   son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter," the spokeswoman said. Trump
   has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption
   that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a
   Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
   Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint,
   but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has
   refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is
   to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to
   have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified
   setting. The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American
   political events, leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from
   fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry. Trump, who thrives on
   combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this step, confident that
   the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party will bolster
   rather than diminish his political support. ___ Associated Press

Is climate change making hurricanes stall?

   Nation

   Updated on Sep 6, 2019 8:15 AM EDT — Published on Sep 4, 2019 7:04 PM
   EDT

   Hurricane Dorian dumped more than 36 inches of rain as of Wednesday
   morning on the Bahamas as it hovered over the islands for more than two
   days, causing dangerous flooding and trapping some people in their
   homes. For the Bahamas, where at least 30 people have died, “the
   devastation is unprecedented,” Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said on
   Monday.

   But the basic conditions of the disaster — a stalled hurricane and its
   sopping aftermath — are not one-off events.

   Over the last seven decades, hurricane stalling, which causes a storm
   to release massive amounts of rain on small areas, has become more
   common, research published in June in the journal Nature shows. But it
   is currently unclear if the trend is due to climate change or natural
   variation.

   By studying hurricanes from 1948 to 2017, researchers found hurricanes
   are slower than in the past and are more likely to sit over a region
   for 48 hours or more. The longer a hurricane stalls, the more rain it
   pours on that area.

   Tim Hall, a senior scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space
   Studies and co-author of the report, said Hurricane Dorian is a
   “classic example of an extreme stalling event.”

   Dorian was on track to move through the Bahamas and hit the southern
   coast of Florida. But then it seemed to pause, wreaking havoc on the
   islands. Now, it has turned northeast, heading up along the coast of
   the U.S. mainland.

   To explain the shift, Hall likens hurricanes to a cork in a river. The
   storms don’t produce any directional force to move themselves. Instead,
   they are pushed around the ocean by wind streams, which are caused by
   high and low pressure systems in the atmosphere.
   Occasionally, the winds die down or push against each other in such a
   way that the hurricane gets stuck — much like a cork might in an eddy —
   until the winds change and push it along.
   “It’s bad enough to get hit by a [Category] 5 hurricane. It’s even
   worse to have it sit there.”

   “In the case of Dorian, it just so happened that in the Bahamas, and
   near the coast of Florida, these large-scale pressure systems were
   changing. The steering winds collapsed, and Dorian stagnated,” Hall
   said.

   While over the Bahamas, Dorian was moving at as little as 1 mile per
   hour.

   “It’s bad enough to get hit by a [Category] 5 hurricane. It’s even
   worse to have it sit there,” Ken Graham, director of the National
   Hurricane Center, told the PBS NewsHour on Tuesday. “It’s just a
   devastating situation for the Bahamas,” he added.

   Other recent examples of stagnant hurricanes include Hurricane Harvey
   over Houston, Texas, in 2017, Hurricane Florence in 2018 over the
   Carolinas and Cyclone Idai in Mozambique earlier this year.

What could be causing hurricanes to stall

   The connection between hurricane stalling and climate change is still
   being studied, but there is a hypothesis being explored about the
   increased frequency.
   Typically, winds are created because the Earth’s poles are much colder
   than the tropics around the equator.

   “The way the planet deals with that imbalance is to move [the energy]
   around” through winds and ocean currents, said Jim Kossin, Hall’s
   co-author and an atmospheric research scientist at the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration.

   Global warming is causing the poles to heat up, reducing the need to
   exchange so much energy between the poles and the tropics.

   While the connection needs more data collected over time , Kossin warns
   that “we shouldn’t wait until we are absolutely sure” before taking
   significant steps to combat climate change, which has already been
   proven to make hurricanes stronger and more dangerous.

What this means for hurricane preparedness

   In general, global warming and climate change are key factors in why
   hurricanes are becoming more damaging.

   Increased sea level rise — due to melting glaciers and heat-driven
   ocean expansion — creates higher storm surges. Warmer air allows
   hurricanes to hold more water, producing more rain. Warmer oceans cause
   hurricanes to have faster wind speeds and stronger central pressure,
   making the storms more intense.

   On top of these patterns, slower and stronger hurricanes make it more
   difficult for emergency management officials and residents to prepare
   for, and respond to, a disaster.

   we know how much

   In the Bahamas, rescue crews struggled to get into the most affected
   areas while the storm lingered. Even after the storm began to move on,
   flooded roads and airport runways blocked needed aid from being
   delivered. On Wednesday, operations were finally able to ramp into high
   gear.

   As the storm moved toward the U.S., aerial photos began to reveal the
   full scale of the devastation with large swaths of the islands
   flattened by Dorian’s heavy winds and rain.

   “If it’s going to sit on top of you, you can’t really plan for all of
   the complexities and destruction that will come from something like
   that. The question is, how do you mitigate it?” said Wes Maul, the
   former director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management who
   opened a natural disaster preparedness consulting firm called Admiral
   Strategy Group.

   Stricter building codes, updated flood maps, ensuring more residents
   have flood insurance, improved forecasting and increased public
   awareness can all help reduce damage and give people a better
   understanding of when they need to evacuate.

   “So much of this is about having a better sense that no one has zero
   risk,” said Kristiane Huber, a fellow at the Center for Climate and
   Energy Solutions. That is, even people who live further inland could be
   subject to severe flooding as hurricanes become more likely to stall.

   As governments and nonprofits cope with the aftermath of Dorian, and
   the increased damage of similar hurricanes in the near future, experts
   warn that they need to be creating plans for decades into the future,
   when climate change is expected to make storms even more intense and
   unpredictable than they are today.

   By Associated Press
   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeatedly prodded Ukraine's
   new leader to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy
   Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according
   to a rough transcript summarizing the call released Wednesday. In the
   call, Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the
   former vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor's
   investigation of his son Hunter. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's
   son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to
   find out about that," Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy. The conversation between the two leaders is one piece of a
   whistleblower's complaint, which followed the July 25 call. The
   complaint is central to the formal impeachment inquiry launched Tuesday
   by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The White House account of the call
   reveals that Trump was willing to engage a foreign leader to dig up
   dirt on a political foe and he goes so far as to volunteer his attorney
   general to help. But Trump appears to stop short in the call of any
   explicit quid pro quo, such as linking Ukraine's help to American
   military aid or other assistance. Days before the call, Trump froze
   nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. It was not clear from the
   summary whether Zelenskiy was aware of that. The president has insisted
   he did nothing wrong and has denied that any request for help was tied
   to the aid freeze. It's illegal under federal law to seek foreign
   government assistance for U.S. elections. The release of the rough
   transcript sets the parameters of the political debate to come. Trump,
   at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said as he often does that's
   he's the victim of "the single greatest witch hunt in American
   history." Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the congressional
   impeachment inquiry. Trump aides believed that his oblique,
   message-by-suggestion style of speaking would not lend itself to the
   discovery of a "smoking gun" in Wednesday's summary. His previous
   messages to his staff were at the center of special counsel Robert
   Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia
   case. One example in the summary: Trump says to Zelenskiy, "I would
   like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been
   through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." In the conversation,
   Trump doesn't distinguish between the roles of Giuliani, his personal
   attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as the nation's top law
   enforcement officer is supposed to be above the political fray. Barr
   has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably during the Mueller
   investigation. "Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, he was the
   mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call
   you," Trump said, according to the call summary. "I will ask him to
   call you along with the attorney general." Immediately after saying
   Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine's
   economy, saying: "Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country." It's not the
   first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to undermine a political
   rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing Hillary Clinton emails
   in 2016, but this is his first documented time doing so while president
   with the weight of the U.S. government at his disposal. The president
   took the 30-minute call from the White House residence, while officials
   in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record of the
   conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice recognition
   software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the document
   declassified Tuesday. The release came against the backdrop of the
   president presiding over a meeting of world leaders at the United
   Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump
   era. The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine's leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said. The whistleblower — a member of the
   intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard
   the information from "White House officials," but did not have
   firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.
   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department's policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said. The official spoke on
   condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal investigative
   deliberations. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the
   attorney general was first notified of Trump's conversation with the
   Ukrainian president "several weeks after the call took place," when the
   department received the referral about potential criminal conduct. "The
   president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine
   investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his
   son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter," the spokeswoman said. Trump
   has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption
   that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a
   Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
   Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint,
   but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has
   refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is
   to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to
   have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified
   setting. The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American
   political events, leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from
   fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry. Trump, who thrives on
   combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this step, confident that
   the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party will bolster
   rather than diminish his political support. ___ Associated Press

1 in 16 U.S. women say their first sexual intercourse was rape

   By — Laura Santhanam
   Health Sep 16, 2019 2:52 PM EDT

   A staggering one in 16 women said they were raped by force or coercion
   the first time they had sexual intercourse, according to a new study of
   government survey data.

   Survivors reported higher rates of unwanted first pregnancy, abortion
   and an array of other physical and mental health problems, study
   authors wrote in an analysis published Monday in the Journal of the
   American Medical Association.

What does the study say?

   Between 2011 and 2017, researchers for the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention questioned a nationally representative sample of 13,310
   women, ages 18 to 44 about marriage, divorce, family life, reproductive
   health and more. Men were not asked about the first time they had
   sexual intercourse, and women with no history of vaginal intercourse
   and girls 17 or younger were not included in this study.

   Among women who responded, 6.5 percent said their first time having sex
   was forced upon them. That equates to an estimated 3.3 million women
   nationwide. If the survey had included girls younger than 17 or women
   older than 45, "certainly that absolute number would be higher," said
   Laura Hawks, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Healthcare for the
   Homeless and the study's lead author.
   "Quite honestly, that's the tip of the iceberg."

   "Quite honestly, that's the tip of the iceberg," said Hawks, who is
   also a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.

   The trauma of this first sexual experience left a legacy of negative
   health outcomes for survivors, the study suggested. Among these survey
   respondents, 30 percent of women reported an unwanted first-time
   pregnancy, compared to 18 percent of women who said they chose to have
   sex the first time.

   Women who were forced to have sex the first time were also more likely
   to report having had an abortion and have had problems ovulating or
   menstruating, significantly higher than women who described their first
   sexual experience as consensual.

   Often, the sexual violence happened when the women were girls. Among
   respondents, 7 percent said they were younger than 10 at the time of
   the assault, while another 29 percent said they were between the ages
   of 11 and 14. The largest segment, at 39 percent, said the assaults
   happened between the ages of 15 and 17.

   While women of all racial and socioeconomic groups reported these
   assualts, women of color and women in poverty reported higher rates of
   first-time forced sex.

Why is this important?

   One out of five women and one out of 71 men will be raped in their
   lifetime, according to the CDC's 2010 National Intimate Partner and
   Sexual Violence Survey. Among those who had been raped, 81 percent of
   women and 35 percent men reported post-traumatic stress disorder of
   varying duration, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource
   Center.

   These first-time experiences are important for physicians to understand
   and monitor with trauma-informed care, Hawks said. This includes
   requesting permission to ask difficult questions and being sensitive
   when performing any genital exams.

   "Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past," Hawks said.

   A patient's exposure to sexual violence "needs to be top of mind for
   medical professionals, particularly those serving teenagers and young
   adults, said said Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse and
   Incest National Network.
   "Any physical exam can be traumatizing for someone who has encountered
   physical or sexual violence in the past."

   Nearly half of all victims of sexual violence who call RAINN's national
   hotline are under age 18, Berkowitz said. Younger people are at greater
   risk and while there is no guaranteed prevention he said there are
   steps children and young adults can take to lower risk.

   Caregivers can empower their children to speak out by discussing
   personal boundaries so children know what kinds of behavior are
   appropriate. It is also important for parents to reassure their child
   that if someone ever mistreats them, the parent or caregiver remains a
   safe person for the child to talk to.

   If an act of sexual violence has already occurred, Berkowitz said
   family and friends should be supportive, let the victim lead the
   conversation, and remember that the "reaction of the first person they
   tell is going to have a big effect on everything that happens next, on
   their healing process, how long it takes, or whether or not they report
   to police."

   If you have been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault
   Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673), available 24 hours, seven days a week.
   You will be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault
   service provider in your area.
