Hepatitis

   An estimated half a billion people are currently infected with viral
   hepatitis
   {{ labels.inthissection }}
   {{ pagetitle }}
     * {{ anchor.name }}

   Find out more about the different strains of viral hepatitis, and how
   MSF diagnoses and treats the infection.

Most people with viral hepatitis make a full recovery.

   Others end up having it long-term and are at great risk of developing
   liver cancer.

   Viral hepatitis causes swelling and inflammation of the liver. It is
   often initiated by infection with hepatitis A, B, C or E virus.

   All four viruses produce a short term infection with some producing
   symptoms like fatigue, fever, loss of appetite and jaundice (yellowing
   of the skin).

   The word is derived from the Greek hêpar, meaning "liver", and -itis,
   meaning "inflammation".

   Hepatitis kills around 1.4 million people every year.

   Hover of the image for an interactive guide to viral hepatitis

   [scaletowidth#tl-876127932991406081;1043138249']

Hepatitis A

   Hepatitis A is transmitted through food or water contaminated by an
   infected person’s faeces. The virus is often found in areas with poor
   hygiene and sanitation.

   Infection most often occurs in children. Hepatitis A usually causes
   only a short term infection and is very rarely fatal. Most people can
   clear the infection on their own without needing treatment.
   Once recovered, some people develop a lifelong immunity.

Hepatitis B

   Hepatitis B is transmitted by contact with an infected person’s blood
   or other body fluids. Hepatitis B can cause a long-term, or chronic,
   infection leading to a high risk of developing liver cancer and
   scarring of the liver, or cirrhosis. Both conditions can be fatal, with
   hepatitis B killing around 780,000 people a year.

   [scaletowidth#tl-876127932991406081;1043138249']

   {{ ctaright.node.field_explanation }}

{{ ctaright.node.field_link }}

Hepatitis C

   Hepatitis C is transmitted by contact with an infected person’s blood,
   often through the use of unsterilised needles. The infection can become
   chronic in up to 85 percent of those infected.

   Most people infected with hepatitis C do not present with symptoms and
   the infection can remain undiagnosed until irreversible liver damage
   occurs and a liver transplant is needed.

Hepatitis E

   Hepatitis E is transmitted by ingesting water contaminated by an
   infected person’s faeces. Outbreaks are often documented in places with
   poor sanitation, like camps for refugees and internally displaced
   people (IDPs). Hepatitis E commonly causes only a mild short-term
   illness.

   Pregnant women are more likely to develop severe liver damage and in
   some cases the virus can be fatal. Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors
   Without Borders (MSF) provides resources to battling and preventing
   hepatitis E in places such as Chad and Kenya.

   Sara Creta/MSF
   MSF gynaecologist Dr Veronica Siebenkotten–Branca performs an
   ultrasound on a pregnant hepatitis E patient at Am Timan hospital,
   Chad.

Treating hepatitis

   Short-term hepatitis A, B, and E infections do not often require
   treatment, but patients can be given supportive care like administering
   fluids if needed.

   For chronic hepatitis B infection, antiviral drugs are used to reduce
   the risk of severe liver damage and increase chances of survival.  But
   treatment is not accessible in many resource-poor settings.

   Chronic hepatitis C infection is treated with pegylated interferon, an
   expensive and burdensome treatment. It can cause severe side-effects
   like depression, which often lead to people stopping treatment early.

   Promising new oral treatments like sofosbuvir have been developed. They
   are more effective at combating the infection and do not produce as
   many side effects. However, these new drugs are unaffordable in
   resource-poor countries. MSF has advocated making hepatitis C treatment
   less costly and more accessible.

Preventing hepatitis

   All hepatitis virus infections are preventable.

   Hepatitis A prevention relies on access to clean water and functioning
   sewage disposal systems. MSF provides water and sanitation specialists
   in places like refugee and displacement camps.

   Hepatitis B infection is most effectively prevented through vaccination
   against the virus. The vaccine is widely available and very safe. MSF
   has vaccinated against the virus in countries like the Democratic
   Republic of Congo and Liberia.

   Hepatitis C prevention relies on reducing the risk of exposure to
   contaminated blood by promoting safe handling and cleaning of needles,
   as well as improving access to clean blood for transfusions.

   Hepatitis E prevention relies on the same methods as hepatitis A, with
   MSF having responded to outbreaks of the virus in places like South
   Sudan.

Lebanon

   Lebanon is struggling to cope with its intake of Syrian refugees
   {{ labels.inthissection }}
   {{ pagetitle }}
     * {{ anchor.name }}

   In Lebanon, we are helping Syrians who are seeking refuge from one of
   the worst conflicts in modern history.

The saying goes that whenever it rains in Syria, the Lebanese have to open
their umbrellas. This now rings more true than ever before.

   Map of MSF's activities in Lebanon, 2015 In its heyday, comparisons
   were often made of the small Mediterranean country with Switzerland
   because of its economic power and diversity.

   But today, it is struggling to cope. The civil war in Syria is putting
   a colossal strain on its neighbours, including Lebanon whose population
   stands at just four million.

   Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been working
   in Lebanon since 1976, when we began our response to the 15 year civil
   war.

   Today, we are helping those seeking refuge from one of the worst
   conflicts in modern history.

MSF’s work in Lebanon: 2015

   Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, it is estimated that
   more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees and Palestinian refugees from
   Syria have arrived in Lebanon. The small country is struggling to cope
   with their acute humanitarian and medical needs.

   Five years into the conflict, most of the refugees are still largely
   reliant on humanitarian assistance for their daily survival. No
   official refugee camps have been established, so families are forced to
   live in informal settlements such as garages, farms, old schools or
   unfinished buildings.

   Overcrowding and inadequate food, water and shelter have had a negative
   impact on people’s health, but they are unable to access the medical
   services they need. We are providing free healthcare to refugees,
   including those whose regular treatment for chronic diseases such as
   diabetes, hypertension and asthma has been interrupted because of the
   war, and expectant mothers, who have often had no access to specialised
   care or medical surveillance during their pregnancies.

Bekaa Valley

   We are continuing to provide basic and reproductive healthcare, health
   promotion activities, mental health counselling and treatment for
   chronic diseases to the vulnerable Lebanese and Syrian refugees living
   in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border.

Beirut

   In southern Beirut, we are working in Shatila camp. MSF’s care includes
   basic healthcare for children under 15, treatment for chronic diseases,
   mental health support services and a women’s health centre assisting
   around 170 deliveries per month.

   A young girls walks through the snow in the Khoder Hawash makeshift
   settlement for refugees on the outskirts of Baalbek in Lebanon's Bekaa
   valley 17 January 2014. Snow and hail fell heavily in Lebanon’s Bekaa
   valley 07 January, where some 400,000 Syrian refugees are sheltering in
   makeshift camps.

Northern Lebanon

   An MSF team is working in the Abu Samra neighbourhood of Tripoli,
   providing reproductive health services, treatment for acute and chronic
   diseases, routine vaccinations and counselling.

   Other MSF teams work in the districts of Jabal Mohsen and Bab el
   Tabbaneh in Tripoli, where fighting between local communities has
   intensified. We offer treatment for acute illnesses, reproductive
   health services and counselling to the local population.

   In January, we distributed urgently needed winter essentials to Syrian
   refugees in Akkar district. Around 900 families — 4,700 people — were
   given stoves, fuel or blankets. Few other organisations work in this
   area.

   From April, MSF worked in the city of El Abdeh, treating acute and
   chronic diseases and providing ante- and postnatal care.

Southern Lebanon

   Our team in the Sidon area shifted its focus to healthcare for
   Palestinians from Lebanon, newly arrived Palestinian refugees from
   Syria and Syrians, particularly children under the age of 15.
   Throughout 2015, MSF supported three health centres, providing
   treatment for acute and chronic diseases, mental healthcare and
   reproductive and maternal health services, and also a referral system
   for patients in need of specialist care.

   A gateway between Africa and Europe, Algeria has been plagued by
   violence over the past half-century.


A gateway between Africa and Europe, Algeria has been plagued by violence
over the past half-century.

   More than a million Algerians were killed in the fight for independence
   from France in 1962, and the country is emerging from a brutal internal
   conflict.

   The Sahara desert covers more than four-fifths of the country. Algeria
   is Africa's biggest country, and is the world's tenth largest.

MSF's work in Algeria: 2015

   Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) started working
   in Algeria again in 2015, after an absence of 13 years.

   MSF opened a new programme in 2015 to increase the availability of HIV
   care for vulnerable groups of people, such as migrants, intravenous
   drug users and sex workers.

   We are working closely with two Algerian organisations in a number of
   centres run by the Ministry of Health and other partners, including one
   in Annaba.

   The aims of the project are to raise awareness of HIV prevention
   strategies; offer testing services in the community; create strong
   links with HIV reference centres in order to provide them with
   technical support to standardise treatment, monitoring and protocols;
   and to donate laboratory equipment. The team will also support the
   decentralisation of care.
