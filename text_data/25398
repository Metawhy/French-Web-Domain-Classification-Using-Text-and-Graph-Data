   1970 Jane & Serge | Photos: Bert Stern for Vogue | New York

   Legendary celebrity photographer Bert Stern was known for his ability
   to coax a truly spontaneous and unexpected moment from his subjects. In
   this image from the June 1, 1970, Vogue, a playful Serge Gainsbourg
   tries to fell his then wife, singer and actress Jane Birkin. Birkin
   wears a midriff-baring top and matching skirt by Maxime de la Falaise
   and knee-high Capezio boots. Gainsbourg, a times a director and actor,
   is also one of the most highly regarded musicians in the world. - Via

   Sculptured Tables | Philippe Hiquily

   Born in 1925 in Montmartre, Philippe Hiquily studied at the Parisian
   Ecole nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in the same class as
   Gimond-Janniau and César. One of his works, La Bicyclette, was acquired
   in 1956 by the Musée d’art moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1959, he
   exhibited in the New York gallery The Contemporaries. He then met the
   surrealist artists, Max Ernst and Georges Bataille at Ninette Lyon’s.
   He is celebrated for his work on metal, and began to design pieces of
   furniture in the 1960s. In the 1980s, he created mobile sculptures
   propelled by electric motors.

   Is Paul Tuttle a Forgotten Designer?

   In the annals of Los Angeles mid-century modernism, Paul Tuttle may not
   loom nearly as large as Charles Eames and Pierre Koenig, but he should.
   He created spare but elegant interiors and custom furnishings such as
   those shown in the 1952 floating glass-box home in Pasadena (2nd
   photo). (The house was designed by Tuttle’s employer, architect
   Thornton Ladd.) - David A. Keeps of the Los Angeles Times

   Denied entrance to Art Center School in Los Angeles, Tuttle “audited “
   a class out of sight of the instructor, Alvin Lustig, a highly
   respected designer. Tuttle created a model and presented it to the
   class as if he were enrolled. When Lustig realized he was not, he
   summarily dismissed him—but he didn’t forget him.

   Impressed with Tuttle’s ability, Lustig contacted him within weeks,
   offering a job in his office. While he was not there long, Tuttle’s
   lasting friendship with the “pioneer of modern design” was the first of
   several opportunities that would propel him into the design
   field.- Jane Ellison of Seasons Magazine
