   Since the accident with the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
   (FDNPP) in March 2011, the public has been very concerned about
   radiation releases from the FDNPP. Thyroid ultrasound examinations,
   which were carried out as part of the Fukushima Health Management
   Survey (FHMS), a large-scale health survey of Fukushima residents,
   revealed a high prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in children and
   young adults. Although the radiation exposure of the residents due to
   the nuclear accident has been estimated to be generally low and is
   unlikely to explain this prevalence of thyroid abnormalities (IAEA,
   2015), the accident and the observed high number of thyroid
   abnormalities have had significant psychological effects on the
   residents of Fukushima.

   In response to questions and concerns raised after the FDNPP accident
   as well as in preparation for possible future nuclear accidents, the
   International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has established an
   international Expert Group on Thyroid Monitoring after Nuclear
   Accidents. The Expert Group will develop strategies and recommendations
   on how to plan and implement thyroid monitoring in populations possibly
   affected by radiation exposure due to nuclear accidents. The Expert
   Group consists of 14 international experts from a variety of fields,
   including cancer screening, radiation epidemiology, radiation
   dosimetry, pathology, oncology, endocrinology, and surgery, and is
   supported by a Scientific Secretariat (Chair and Scientific
   Coordinator) from the IARC Section of Environment and Radiation as well
   as three invited specialists. Most of the experts have been actively
   involved in a number of research projects related to the FDNPP accident
   and/or the accident with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.

   The primary goal of the Thyroid Monitoring after Nuclear Accidents
   (TM-NUC) project is to use current scientific evidence and past
   experience to develop principles for thyroid monitoring in populations
   possibly affected by radiation exposure due to nuclear accidents. Such
   principles will help guide policy-makers and health professionals in
   planning thyroid monitoring in case of nuclear accidents.

   The TM-NUC project is funded by the Ministry of the Environment of
   Japan.

Knowledge gaps and research ideas proposed by the IARC Expert Group on
Thyroid Health Monitoring after Nuclear Accidents

   A second report from the IARC Expert Group on Thyroid Health Monitoring
   after Nuclear Accidents is now available. The second report summarizes
   some of the knowledge gaps identified during the development of the
   first report (published as IARC Technical Publication No. 46), as well
   as potential strategies to address those gaps. This new report aims to
   encourage the relevant scientific community, health-care providers, and
   research funding bodies around the world to create and strengthen the
   evidence base for future public health and other interventions in case
   of a nuclear accident, such as a thyroid monitoring programme.

Launch of IARC Technical Publication on long-term strategies for thyroid
health monitoring after nuclear power plant accidents

   A new technical report coordinated by scientists from the International
   Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluates long-term strategies for
   thyroid health monitoring after nuclear power plant accidents. This
   report was generated by an international multidisciplinary Expert Group
   convened by IARC’s Section of Environment and Radiation and is based on
   an evaluation of the scientific evidence and experiences from previous
   nuclear accidents. It provides technical recommendations aimed at
   government officials, policy-makers, and health professionals who would
   be involved in the decision-making, planning, or implementation of
   thyroid health monitoring in case of a nuclear accident.
