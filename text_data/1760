Best times to post on social media for 2019

   Photo of the author, Elizabeth Arens by Elizabeth Arens

   Social media is always evolving, and users’ behavior changes with it.
   One fact that doesn’t change is that all social platforms move fast,
   with a constant stream of content vying for attention. You want to get
   the most eyes possible on your content and maximize engagement by
   knowing the best times to post on social networks.

   It’s not enough to guess when users might log in to a given network, or
   when audiences in your niche are hungriest for the latest information.
   Now that more and more brands from all kinds of industries realize the
   value of connecting with their audiences on social networks, it’s
   important to understand how your audience uses social platforms and
   what they want out of your content. An ecommerce brand may see social
   engagement follow daily and seasonal patterns of shopping engagement,
   while a corporate thought leadership account may see plenty of clicks
   at the start of the workday when readers are looking for inspiration.

   In order to get granular and find out the best times to publish on
   social media for four social media networks, we worked closely with
   Sprout’s data science team to pull this information based on our
   customers. The data below shows when our 25,000-plus Sprout customers
   were engaged the most (and least) across major networks and broken down
   by industry.

   Let’s take a look at the unique insights we found for the best times to
   post on each social network:
     * Best times to post on Facebook
     * Best times to post on Instagram
     * Best times to post on Twitter
     * Best times to post on LinkedIn
     * How we gathered this data

   Disclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan
   types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded in
   Central Time Zone (CST). Number of engagements represents total
   engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour
   time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level
   engagement times.

Automatically optimize publishing with Sprout Social

     Not sure about the best times to publish content for your audience?
     Sprout takes the guesswork out of scheduling social posts.

     Sprout’s patented ViralPost® technology analyzes your audience data
     and detects the most active times for authentic engagement, enabling
     you to automatically schedule content at the best times for your
     brand.

   …[H]aving Sprout to not only help schedule content but also know when
   the most optimal time to publish is, depending on the page or platform?
   It’s a game changer.

Best times to post on Facebook

   Facebook global engagement

   Facebook has over two billion active users, making it the most
   populated platform by far. This huge audience means there’s a major
   opportunity for organic engagement on Facebook, if you keep in mind the
   current Facebook algorithm. The changes in the algorithm in the last
   couple of years have emphasized friends, family and meaningful
   connection, so content that drives genuine engagement is your best bet.

   In addition to a content strategy that connects meaningfully with your
   audience, you’ll best meet this need for engagement by posting at the
   times when users are most active on the network.

   Here are the key data points we found for the best times to post on
   Facebook:
     * Best times to post to Facebook: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the best day to post on Facebook.
     * Most consistent engagement: Weekdays from 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday has the least amount of engagement for Facebook
       during the week.
     * Lowest engagement: Early mornings and evenings, before 7 a.m. and
       after 5 p.m. have the least amount of engagement per day.

What we learned

   As you’ll see with other social networks, mid-week is the peak period
   on Facebook. The middle of each weekday, from morning to mid-afternoon,
   are safe times to post, meaning engagement remains consistent
   throughout these blocks of time.

   While people frequently check in throughout the middle of the day to
   see what’s going on, the peak times are around lunch breaks. When
   people have more time to scroll through their Facebook feeds and dig
   into interesting posts, engagement rises correspondingly.

   On the other hand, late night and early evening along with weekend days
   bring in relatively low engagement. While people may check in or post a
   few updates from weekend activities in the middle of the day on
   Saturday, these times aren’t your best bet for reaching audiences.

Best times to post on Facebook for consumer goods

   Facebook consumer goods engagement

   Whether you’re promoting an online shopping experience or driving
   audiences to brick-and-mortar retail, Facebook plays a key part in your
   social strategy. In addition to your niche’s unique customer personas,
   find your audiences when they’re most active at these top times to post
   for consumer goods and retail:

   Disclaimer: Industry specific heat maps are more concentrated to show
   medium- and high-level engagement.
     * The best times for consumer goods brands to post to Facebook:
       Wednesday at 1 p.m. and Friday at 11 a.m.
     * Other high engagement times: Wednesday from 1–3 p.m, Friday from
       10–11 a.m. and Thursday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: weekdays from 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 10 p.m.–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for media

   Facebook media engagement

   Social is a crowded space for media companies vying for attention, and
   the Facebook algorithm can make it especially difficult to find a place
   on users’ feeds. Tap into these times to post to boost engagement:
     * The best times for media companies to post on Facebook: Tuesday at
       5 p.m. and Friday from 8–9 a.m.
     * Other top times: Wednesday from 8–9 a.m., Wednesday at 5 p.m. and
       Thursday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday 9 a.m.-5 p.m
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 10 p.m.–3 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for education

   Facebook education engagement

   Facebook can be a great source of information for education
   institutions. Compared to other industries, mornings and nights offer
   stronger opportunities for schools’ social media content to get seen,
   as well as some spikes in activity on the weekend. Check out the full
   details of the best times to post on Facebook for education:
     * The best times for schools to post on Facebook: Wednesday at 9 a.m.
       and Saturday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 9 a.m–3 p.m,
       with the peak occurring between 9 a.m.–12 p.m. on those days.
     * Saturday from 12 p.m.-9.pm is also highly active.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday has the least engagement, and the lowest
       engagement times for schools are every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for nonprofit

   Facebook nonprofit engagement

   Facebook is a great place to highlight a nonprofit’s mission with
   longer form posts and discussions, as well as drawing attention to
   upcoming events. We found that nonprofits on Facebook frequently see
   the most engagement during weekday mornings.
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Facebook: Wednesday at 8–9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times: Thursday at 10 a.m. and Friday 8-10
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday show the least engagement
       per day, and with the worst times being 10 p.m.–5 a.m. every day.

Best times to post on Facebook for tech

   Facebook tech engagement

   Even with challenges in gaining organic engagement, Facebook is still
   an essential part of tech companies’ social strategy. Whether you’re
   looking to tap into conversations geared towards a B2B audience or a
   B2C one, top times for tech companies to post on Facebook include:
     * The best time for tech companies to post to Facebook: Wednesday at
       10 a.m.
     * Wednesday from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. is a peak time during the week as
       well.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday 8 a.m.–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 6 p.m–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for healthcare

   Facebook healthcare engagement

   Social audiences increasingly expect healthcare practices to have a
   social presence. Facebook is a great place to highlight your local
   practice and provide essential info to current and prospective
   patients. The best times to post for healthcare to reach these
   audiences include:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Facebook:
       Wednesday at 9–10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m.–3 or
       4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Avoid Saturday and Sunday, which have minimal
       engagement, and every day from 9 p.m.–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram

   Instagram global engagement

   Having recently grown to one billion monthly active users, and a median
   1.60% engagement rate per post, Instagram is definitely on the rise in
   the social space. The network has also debuted a number of new features
   recently, expanding the options for how users can interact with posts
   on this visual-first platform.

   Similar to Facebook’s 2018 focus on a more authentic and
   personal-feeling social experience, the Instagram algorithm in 2019
   prioritizes certain posts algorithmically in a user’s feed, marking a
   change from the previous reverse chronological order. In addition to
   the main feed, Stories has grown significantly since its 2016 launch,
   and 2018 also brought the debut of Instagram TV. Taken together, all of
   these options let brands create engaging video content of both
   micro-length and long-form templates.

   With all of these ways to reach an audience, plus Instagram’s notable
   focus on retail, you’ll want to know these key stats for the best times
   for brands to post on Instagram:
     * Best times to post on Instagram: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and Friday at
       10–11 a.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the overall best day to post to Instagram
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday receives the least amount of engagement on
       Instagram
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs during late night and early morning from
       11 p.m.–3 a.m.

What we learned

   While Instagram engagement peaks mid-day and mid-week, similar to the
   other major social networks, there are a few opportune windows found in
   the evening and morning during the middle of the week. While the safest
   times to post are still during those core weekday times, it could be
   well worth it for certain brand niches to consider if your audiences
   are among those reaching for the ‘Gram first thing in the morning or
   last thing before sleeping.

   While there is a bit of increased engagement around midday on Saturday,
   weekends aren’t your best bet for getting eyes on your posts.
   Similarly, even those late night users eventually pack it in, with
   engagement dropping in the latest hours of the night and earliest hours
   of the morning

Best times to post on Instagram for consumer goods

   instagram consumer goods engagement

   Over the past year, Instagram has cemented its role as a top network
   for shopping. This means that any retail or shopping business can’t
   afford to ignore the platform. Improve your chances of cutting through
   the noise in this busy space by keeping in mind the top times to post
   on Instagram for consumer goods and retail:
     * The best time for consumer brands to post on Instagram: Wednesday
       at 3 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
     * Another higher engagement time period occurs on Saturday around 10
       a.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday has the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m–3 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for media

   instagram media engagement

   As Instagram expands its video offerings, it’s becoming a unique
   channel for media companies to highlight their best visual content. Our
   findings show that Instagram’s audience taps in a bit earlier in the
   day for media content than other industries, so consider these times to
   post when planning to highlight your best content:
     * The best time for media companies to post on Instagram: Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m–4
       p.m.
     * There’s also a period of higher engagement that lasts all the way
       through Thursday night into Friday morning. It’s lower than the
       highest peak times, but it could be a unique time to capture
       audiences that aren’t active in other industries’ niches.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday have the least engagement
       for media companies on Instagram.

Best times to post on Instagram for education

   instagram education engagement

   For colleges and schools, Instagram is a great opportunity to build
   your visual identity and highlight on-campus experiences. Engagement
   patterns trend a bit later in the day for education as the
   student-heavy audience starts getting on their phones in the later
   afternoon. Here are the best times to post for educational institutions
   on Instagram:
     * The best time to post on Instagram for schools: Friday at 10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Saturday at 10 a.m.–8
       p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday at 11 a.m., Friday
       from 11 a.m.–12 p.m. and 2 p.m., and Saturday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 11 p.m–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for nonprofit

   instagram nonprofit engagement

   Instagram is the perfect complement to the rest of your nonprofit’s
   social strategy. If you’ve promoted an event ahead of time on Facebook,
   follow up on Instagram to show off photos from the event and start
   building your brand’s visual identity. Keep in mind these peak times to
   post for nonprofits:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post to Instagram: Wednesday at 2
       p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Monday from 2–3 p.m., Tuesday
       from 1–3 p.m. and a relatively strong block of time on Saturday
       from 1–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday gets the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for tech

   instagram tech engagement

   Trends for the tech industry vary somewhat from the global peak times
   on Instagram, with audiences tuning into their feeds for bursts of
   activity earlier in the day. Take these peak times into account for
   your content planning as you highlight your products, services and
   company culture on Instagram:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Instagram: Wednesday at
       6 a.m. and 9 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday from 10–11 a.m., Friday from
       7–10 a.m., and Saturday from 7–11 a.m.
     * There’s also fairly high opportunity for engagement on Tuesday at
       10 p.m., and both Wednesday and Friday mornings show more
       engagement than other industries at these early hours.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday had the least engagement overall for tech
       companies.

Best times to post on Instagram for healthcare

   instagram healthcare engagement

   It’s clear from our findings that Instagram still isn’t a priority for
   many healthcare practices. However, considering the high engagement it
   drives for many other industries, it’s clear that audiences, including
   prospective patients, are on the platform. It’s well worth it to expand
   your reach by planning around these times to post:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Instagram:
       Tuesday at 8 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday from 7 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Evening and overnight every day from 6 p.m.–6
       a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter

   Twitter global engagement

   Twitter presents a huge opportunity for brands to connect directly with
   audiences and manage customer care.

   This means timeliness is key on Twitter. While the social network
   selectively highlights some activity out of chronological sequence
   based on user interests, most people are still scrolling through to
   catch up on the latest posts and musings from their group of followed
   accounts. Posting at off-peak hours could and cause you to miss out on
   a lot of your potential engagement.

   With 500 million tweets sent per day, Twitter provides a goldmine of
   social opinions and conversation that can inform your brand strategy.
   In addition to using Twitter listening to know what topics offer the
   most opportunity to engage, you’ll want to keep in mind these stats for
   when to post on Twitter:
     * Best times to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Best days: Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days to post on
       Twitter.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–4
       p.m.
     * Worst day: Saturday gets the least engagement.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs every day from 10 p.m–4 a.m.

What we learned

   Twitter heats up a bit earlier in the morning, probably as audiences
   are starting to go about their day and take a moment to catch up on and
   digest the biggest news and updates from their areas of interest. The
   peak times of engagement also carry into the lunch hour, and begin to
   taper slightly through the late afternoon and evening, finally dropping
   off as late night approaches.

   Like other social networks, mid-week on Tuesday and Wednesday are your
   top days to post on Twitter, and engagement drops off on weekends. We
   do still see that morning check-in occurring around 9 on both Saturday
   and Sunday, just to a lesser extent.

Best times to post on Twitter for consumer goods

   twitter consumer goods engagement

   Twitter is an essential customer care channel for retailers and
   ecommerce businesses. Compared to Facebook and Instagram engagement,
   activity actually builds during the weekend rather than falling off.
   This could indicate that users are online for answers and help about
   products they’ve been putting off during the week, or seeking info to
   complement a shopping trip or outing. Either way, quick response times
   are essential when people take time on days off to reach out to your
   brand, so be ready for these peak times:
     * The best time for consumer goods brands to post to Twitter: Sunday
       at 11 a.m.
     * Other peak engagement times include Saturday at 3 p.m. and
       Wednesday at 1 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Sunday from 9 a.m.–3 p.m. or Monday
       through Wednesday from 12 p.m–3 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Friday is the day with the lowest engagement,
       and the worst times for consumer goods each day are between 10
       p.m–6 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for media

   twitter media engagement

   Twitter has become a go-to platform for journalists, authors and
   experts to share ideas and opinions—often around the clock. We saw this
   reflected in the hotspot of activity that lasts throughout the night
   from Thursday through Friday morning. There are still some other peak
   times you’ll want to know about if you’re looking to get your top
   stories and content in front of Twitter users:
     * The best times for media companies to post on Twitter: Thursday at
       9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Thursday from 4 p.m–8 p.m. and
       Friday from 7 a.m.–11 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: All day Saturday.

Best times to post on Twitter for education

   twitter education engagement

   Educational institutions can take a unique approach to Twitter by
   segmenting out different parts of their social stream with separate
   Twitter accounts for everything from sports teams to dining services.
   As with other social networks for education, the peak times are shifted
   a bit from the global top times, so adjust to the unique schedules of
   your students with these top times to post:
     * The best time for schools to post on Twitter: Saturday at 5 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Saturday from 1 p.m.–10 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Safe times to post during the week
       include Wednesday from 8 a.m.–12 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and early morning every day from 12
       a.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for nonprofit

   twitter nonprofit engagement

   Nonprofits have a great opportunity to build up their community on
   Twitter and start conversations with the audiences most engaged with
   their causes. Keep in mind these key times to post for nonprofits on
   Twitter:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 7
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday from 6 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday get the least engagement, as
       well as every day between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for tech

   twitter tech engagement

   It’s no surprise the tech industry is consistently active throughout
   the week on Twitter. Whether you have one or multiple accounts
   conducting customer service, promoting your brand or sharing thought
   leadership, consider using social listening or Twitter advanced search
   features to tap into the topics your audiences are discussing. Consider
   these top times for the tech industry to get active on Twitter:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Twitter: Tuesday at 9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include the rest of the morning on
       Tuesday from 7–10 a.m. and Wednesday from 8-10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–1
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday are the days that get the
       least engagement, and it’s also lower from 6 p.m to 5 a.m. every
       day.

Best times to post on Twitter for healthcare

   twitter healthcare engagement

   As we’ve emphasized, Twitter is ideal for conversation and customer
   care. Health questions can be the most pressing of all, so whether it’s
   an account for a local practice or a major pharmaceutical brand, be
   ready for your audiences by being aware of the best times for
   healthcare accounts on Twitter:
     * The best times for healthcare practices and business to post on
       Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
     * Other notably high engagement times include Monday at 2 p.m.,
       Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Friday at 8 a.m. There’s also
       additional engagement on Wednesday morning compared to other
       weekday mornings.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: The day with the least engagement is Sunday.

Best times to post on LinkedIn

   times to post for linkedin

   LinkedIn targets a more specific audience than other social networks,
   and as it continues to grow, we’ve gotten a fuller picture of the best
   times to post compared to our overview in 2018. In order to provide the
   greatest accuracy, we didn’t break down this data into individual
   industries.

   The network’s more niche audience is no reason to ignore its marketing
   power, however. These motivated users tend to generate more leads,
   especially for B2B marketing. Here’s our findings on the best times to
   post on LinkedIn:
     * The best times to post to LinkedIn: Wednesday at 9–10 a.m. and 12
       p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–2
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs on Sunday and the least popular times to
       post are every day from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.

What we learned

   Considering LinkedIn’s corporate-minded mix of thought leaders, job
   seekers and company page curation, it’s no surprise that activity is
   much more concentrated around workdays. Activity ramps up on Tuesday as
   people get through the Monday rush, and tapers fairly uniformly after 3
   p.m. as the last tasks of the workday take priority.

   Weekends garner fairly low engagement, which is expected as people step
   away from their devices and desks on Saturday and Sunday.

   We understand that these type of reports can raise questions about just
   where the data is coming from. That’s why we want to be clear about the
   data we pulled and how we got here.

   First off, we were luckily enough to work with Sprout Social’s very own
   data science team to gather together this information from our
   customers. Joel Booth, a Senior Data Scientist at Sprout, explained how
   it all works.

   “Sprout integrates with the different social media platforms via their
   API, which allows the application to receive messages on behalf of our
   customers,” Booth said. “Essentially, this is how we power features
   such as Sprout’s Smart Inbox and Reports.”

Using ViralPost to publish at the best times

   Our data team is constantly collecting data. And this information isn’t
   just used to put together amazing reports like you’ve read above. In
   fact, Sprout Social’s very own ViralPost works off this data regularly
   for our customers.
   ViralPost hones in on the best times to post on social media

   Booth further explained that Sprout’s proprietary algorithm analyzes
   the publishing history of our customers and collects data on how and
   when their audiences engage. This is what makes ViralPost so unique—it
   allows users to find future times to post that work best for their
   channels.

   “ViralPost is an opportunity for the data science team to not only make
   our customers’ social efforts more effective, but also easier,” Booth
   said. “The algorithm can look at more messages, more engagements and
   more factors over a far wider range of time than a person in order to
   pinpoint those ideal times to send a message and how those times change
   week to week.”

   Simply put, having publishing times is extremely handy, but why not use
   a tool that can publish during the suggested times? ViralPost works
   with actual customer data, just like what we’ve pulled to assemble this
   report, to give you the best opportunity for your individual account.

Introduction

   Whether new to the industry or building on years of experience, it’s
   easy for businesses to fall into the trap of employing ineffective
   social media advertising practices.

   People come to social platforms to keep up with friends, learn
   something new and experience a range of emotions. Given the sheer
   volume of content in this space, brands will miss their opportunity to
   reach new audiences if their ads can’t cut through the clutter. It
   takes a combination of arresting creative and relevant targeting to
   break through in the feed—especially since consumers are often biased
   against ads.

   It’s true, people don’t welcome ads with open arms. In fact, our survey
   of more than 1,000 Americans found that their collective perception of
   social advertising has mostly stagnated or declined in the past year.
   This indicates that when on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and
   Twitter, a majority of consumers aren’t finding much that stops them
   from scrolling right past brands’ ads.
   social media advertising - decline in public perception

   And while 39% of consumers attributed their declined perception of
   social ads to recent political events, the top reason for the drop
   cited by 58% of respondents was simply seeing too many social ads
   overall.

   With the wealth of data and targeting options out there, social should
   open doors to hyper-relevant advertising. But this paradox of choices
   has overwhelmed, rather than empowered, many marketers on the path to
   producing better ads.

   How can marketers break the mold on social and create ads that drive
   conversions, conversations and maybe even a viral hit? The coveted
   scroll-stopper ad doesn’t necessarily include the flashiest celebrity
   or the most provocative tagline.

   What does it involve? Read on for new data that breaks down what makes
   people take action on social ads.

Entertain Me

   Entertainment has always been a hallmark of marketing. Advertising
   great Leo Burnett even cautioned marketers about forgetting that
   fact—as he put it, “one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not
   that of misleading people, but that of boring them to death.”

   While this philosophy seems obvious, most social ads fail to put it
   into practice. It’s clear that to succeed on social, marketers must go
   back to basics when developing their ads.

   By and large, entertainment is still the single best way to stop the
   scroll, with 41% of people reporting that entertaining content makes
   them more likely to engage with a social ad.
   most engaging social ad content

   But what does “entertainment” mean in practice?

   Good news: It doesn’t necessarily require the creative resources of a
   global conglomerate, but it does call for an investment in visually
   driven content.

   On social in general, Sprout research shows that video is one of the
   main formats people want to see from brands (83%). GIFs also perform
   well with 58% of people enjoying them—among Millennials, this rises to
   70%. Brands that go beyond stylized product shots and into content that
   inspires emotion in prospective customers will have more success being
   noticed and remembered.

   These messages also don’t have to be delivered by a paid third party,
   whether a celebrity or a niche influencer. This might surprise many
   marketers. After all, isn’t partnering up with influencers a great way
   to introduce your brand to potential customers and deliver unique
   content?

   Sort of. Though the popularity of influencer marketing has created
   thousands of professional entertainers working in social, an influencer
   partnership isn’t the only route to engagement. People are more
   interested in seeing ads from brands than from influencers—57% to 43%,
   respectively. Our findings underscore a preference for transparency,
   with advertising coming straight from the brand itself.

Sprout Stance: Here We Are Now, Entertain Us

     When brands turn to social to build top-of-funnel awareness—in the
     paid or organic realms—entertainment can open the door. Invest in a
     social team or resources that support creative multimedia content
     development, driving an introduction to your brand that intrigues
     and attracts customers. Whether it’s branding a character like The
     Most Interesting Man or crafting a short video with an inspiring
     message, your team must have the internal buy-in to develop and
     iterate on concepts that will drive greater results than your
     average product shot.

Educate Me

   While building awareness is important, ensuring potential customers
   understand what your brand offers is just as crucial. The latter
   requires that consumers make personal connections with your brand—they
   might appreciate your differentiators, share the values you’re
   communicating or learn a new skill that your offering enables. This
   type of advertising makes people feel good about your products and
   confident in choosing your brand over others. So what kind of content
   can help?

   Education. Our survey found that a third of people are more likely to
   engage with social ads that teach them something.

   No wonder Tasty’s rapid-fire recipe videos had such a meteoric rise.
   Whether it’s a recipe video, a style tutorial or a behind-the-scenes
   look at how products are crafted, educational content positions your
   brand as a resource and leaves consumers wanting more.

   Furthermore, people who would engage with a social ad that interested
   them aren’t looking to buy directly—instead, 65% of consumers will
   click through to learn more. People want ads that promise further
   education, whether it’s about the product, subject matter or an
   adjacent topic.
   social media advertising - actions consumers take

   There’s even more good news: where opinion of social ads is declining,
   it’s often because the content is uninteresting (31%) and irrelevant
   (26%). Creating educational content that adds value to consumers’
   social experiences naturally addresses these two areas of
   dissatisfaction.

Sprout Stance: Embrace the CTE

     That’s call to education. Remember, most people aren’t logging onto
     popular social channels to shop. Rather, they seek a social
     experience. That’s why CTAs centered around education and learning
     are a solid bet: read more, watch more, learn more. This is great
     for brands, as it’s another opportunity to add value into routine
     interactions and remain top of mind until people are ready to
     convert.

     Educational ads hold value after consumers have made a purchase as
     well—in particular for big-ticket items, such as a car, that only
     come around every few years or decade. In the interim period, fresh
     content reinforces the positive emotions a consumer felt when he or
     she made the original purchase. Content that showcases new or
     unexpected uses also helps the item continue to add value in
     consumers’ eyes. Cultivating brand loyalty and advocacy over time
     requires educating your existing audience about what differentiates
     your brand—something your paid and organic social programs can
     tackle in tandem.

Give Me a Break

   Social has opened the floodgates to new types of creative ad
   experiences, but there’s one advertising classic that never gets old:
   discounts.

   While entertainment may be king, it should come as no surprise that
   across generations, 37% of people are more likely to engage with social
   ads that save them money.

   However, segmenting generational preferences shows a shift among Baby
   Boomers, who actually rank discounts as their top motivator.
   Conversely, younger social users don’t want their first impression of a
   brand to scream “BUY NOW!”
   social media ad content - preferences by generation

   While the decision to offer a discount may require buy-in from others
   in your organization, the ability to communicate value is always on the
   table. Given Baby Boomers’ preference for discounts and educational
   content, there’s an opportunity to combine the two into stories and
   messaging that highlights your value proposition and connects with this
   generation, even if there’s no immediate sale.

   Every campaign should open with one question: Who are you trying to
   reach?

   If this isn’t something you can easily and confidently answer, go back
   to the basics. Knowing that Millennials care less about saving money
   than they do about being entertained and making an emotional connection
   to brands—and that Boomers are looking to save cold hard cash—there’s
   no reason to blanket a diverse range of audiences with a single
   message.

   As the adage goes, price communicates value. If you know which
   audiences truly desire discounts, you can be judicious with your
   financial incentives—and offer them to the right groups.

Sprout Stance: Try, Test & Try Again

     The golden rule is this: Know your audience and use the tools at
     your disposal to speak directly to them. Otherwise, you’re
     practically inviting people to scroll right past your ads on social.

     But knowing what types of ads motivate your audience to action is
     just one piece of the puzzle. The other is delivering those ads to
     the right people at the right time. No matter what creative you
     use—and whether you’re offering discounts, entertainment or
     education—the most effective ad is always a relevant one.

     The best way to ensure your ads make a personalized impact is to
     understand the specific audience you’re trying to reach. Then you
     can tailor your message and target accordingly. Test your messaging
     across different paid audiences to understand what resonates, then
     iterate based on those results to ensure budget, strategy and
     consumer expectations are in alignment.

Don't Assume You Know Me—Prove It

   The common denominator across all our findings is “me, me, me.” That
   shouldn’t be surprising.

   Getting to know your audience in depth and breadth demonstrates a
   commitment to seeing them as real people instead of sales targets. The
   consumer research process also ensures a more strategic use of your
   marketing budget to gain a competitive edge.

   The stakes have never been higher: 93% of firms are investing marketing
   budget in Facebook, 67% in Instagram and 51% in Twitter, according to
   Hanapin Marketing.

   Bottom line: If you’re going to spend, be diligent and be social. Get
   inside your consumers’ heads — and know exactly what inspires them to
   take action.

Introduction

   A little brother poking you incessantly. The aggravating beat of that
   bad song. Another brand trying to sell you something on social media?

   Most marketers think they know what their audience wants, but rarely do
   they ask. Social media is no different. Some brands can be straight up
   annoying on social media. Whether it’s pounding promotions or spouting
   awkward jokes, brands just don’t know how to strike the right tone.

   But it doesn’t have to be that way. The truth is that 86% of social
   media users want to and do follow brands on social. But when they do,
   they’re most often looking for relevant content, not another
   cringe-worthy post from an out of touch company.

   For this report, Sprout surveyed more than 1,000 Facebook, Twitter and
   Instagram users to determine what annoys them about brands on social,
   what drives them to unfollow and which industries are on the right side
   of the line.

   Chapter 2

The Annoyance Factor Is Real

   From ignoring customers to trendjacking the term bae, a brand’s social
   posts can be just as irritating as the obnoxious shares from your aunt.

Give The People What They Want

   The issue is not that people don’t welcome brand presence on social,
   it’s that many brands are applying social tactics that don’t correlate
   with what people want.

   If you think that people are flocking to your brand’s Facebook Page for
   BOGO deals and coupons, think again. While 86% of social media users
   follow a brand, nearly 60% of them are annoyed with too many promotions
   by brands. The perils of over-promotion only escalate if brands are
   unresponsive. In fact, 1 in 4 people are annoyed when you don’t respond
   to them. And seeing as only 1 in 10 messages on social actually get a
   reply from brands, it’s likely that you’re ticking off a lot of fans.

   One-sided content isn’t the sole annoyance. People are also taking
   notice of the tone and content of social profiles that just don’t seem
   to fit. Trying to convince a younger demographic that your legacy brand
   is hip by inserting “on fleek” and other casual chatter into your
   posts? You’ll be better off if you stick to being yourself. 38% of
   people find the use of slang to be irritating and another 32% are
   annoyed when a brand tries to be funny–when they clearly are not.

   All that said, you do need to understand and maintain a brand
   personality because 34% of people find a lack of personality to be just
   as bad.

Sprout Stance

     The Mad Men era is over. Don Draper shouldn’t be managing your
     Facebook Page and the creative for your Tweets shouldn’t mimic a
     print advertisement. Regardless of your budget, competition for
     capturing your followers’ attention is steep. Each one of your
     social posts is up against a backdrop of cat GIFs, political
     viewpoints and compelling vacation photos.

     Instead of bombarding social feeds with stock images or forced copy,
     do the work: Identify your brand values, collect data, identify
     audiences and target your content accordingly. Additionally, pull
     together guidelines that steer clear of over-played phrases and stay
     true to your brand’s personality.

   Chapter 3

From Uncouth to Unfollow

   Being annoyed is one thing, but what causes people to actually unfollow
   a brand?

To Follow or Not to Follow?

   Being annoyed is one thing, but what causes people to actually unfollow
   a brand? First, let’s explore what gets them to follow you in the first
   place. 73% of people surveyed said that liking a brand on social starts
   with being interested in a brand’s products or services.

   Outside of basic interest, people want something more from your brand.
   The majority of followers will come to your social profile looking for
   deals and promotions (58%) or incentives (42%). However, as we quickly
   uncovered, neither tactic will get them to stick around. Keep that in
   mind as you’re developing your social strategy–create content that
   actually means something to your audience.

   Furthermore, 25% of people started following you so they could have a
   two-way dialogue with your brand. People want to interact with your
   brand, so ensure you’re set up for success in social customer care.

   While interest or incentive may bring the bulk of people to your
   brand’s profile, it won’t keep them there. Too many promotional
   messages not only annoy followers, they also cause 46% of people to
   unfollow a brand.

   And in case you needed further proof that a dynamic content strategy is
   a necessity, 41% of people will unfollow a brand that doesn’t share
   relevant information. So expand your tactics and be sure you’re
   diversifying your social content strategy. Whether that’s through
   curating thoughtful third-party content, sharing more user-generated
   content, participating in co-marketing opportunities or engaging your
   communities with interactive quizzes and contests.

   That relevancy takes on even more weight when you consider that 7 in 10
   people have unfollowed a brand because they were embarrassed their
   friends might see. People just don’t want to be associated with brands
   that are antiquated or ridiculous. While your social profile might not
   be the full story, a brand refresh on that platform might help your
   overall perception.

Sprout Stance

     When it’s time to measure the impact of your social media efforts,
     do follower counts matter or are they just vanity metrics? The truth
     this that while the quality of your followers is definitely more
     important than the quantity, any shifts in volume speak to a larger
     trend with your brand. Too many self-promotional or irrelevant posts
     alienate your audience and prompts them to leave your social
     channels. If you’re producing relevant, engaging content, your
     community will organically grow.

   Chapter 4

Repetition Improves Community Receptivity

   As social media marketers, we’re constantly proving the ROI of social
   media and making valiant attempts to better tie it to direct sales. But
   how many people actually purchase something because they see it on
   social? And, how long does this sales process take?

Unforgettable Content is Recycled Content

   A staggering 75% of people have purchased something because they saw it
   on social media. But how many times do they actually need to see a post
   before they make the purchase?

   Most people have to see a product or service 2-4 times on social before
   they purchase it. And nearly 20% of people need to see a social post or
   advertisement 5-8 times. Purchasing decisions prompted by social take
   time. That’s why it’s important your brand is focused maintaining a
   steady community of invested followers and analyzing the metrics that
   can better inform your social content strategy.

   Again, brands have to navigate a delicate balance between informing
   their audiences and bombarding them. While you want to ensure your
   audience sees that post a few times, you can’t hit them over the head
   with promotions for fear they’ll click that unfollow button. Because
   our survey found that 57% of people are more likely to buy from a brand
   that they follow on social, you’ll want to keep those followers.

Sprout Stance

     If 57% of people who follow you on social media are likely to buy
     something from your brand and most people need to see a post 2-4
     times on social before they make a purchase, why wouldn’t you better
     target your followers with multiple messages? In order to be
     successful, your social strategy has to aim to solidify your brand
     recognition. You need to ensure that your followers are seeing your
     posts more than once.

     That being said, you don’t want to bombard your audience with the
     exact same messaging over and over again. Minimally edit and revise
     your social post in order to keep your followers attentive and
     engaged. Change the headline or photo for a blog article you’re
     posting on Facebook. Link to your website by including a different
     quote or data point in your Tweet. Try posting the same product
     photo on Instagram in different settings and environments and make
     sure to include an updated caption.

     A strategic paid and organic social distribution plan will better
     target your content and put it in front of potential fans who are
     interested in your brand. Make sure your approach is balanced and
     that, regardless of whether a post is paid or organic, it’s
     providing your followers with value.

   Chapter 5

Tell Us What You Really Think

   Consumer perceptions don't always match a marketer's reality. That's
   why we wanted to determine which industries people found annoying and
   compare that to our own data around posting behavior.

Retail Gets It Right

   We wanted to determine which industries people found annoying and
   compare that to our own data around posting behavior.

   On the flip side, the Government is considered the most annoying
   industry on social media by those surveyed. This isn’t surprising when
   you consider that it takes the industry 10.7 hours on average to
   respond to consumers.

   Banking/Finance came out in second place in the annoyance factor.
   Preconceived notions about the industry as a whole clearly play a role,
   since they’re actually the second most responsive industry according to
   our data.

   Perception and reality are often very different. Therefore, we took a
   look at how brands’ responsiveness was perceived and cross-referenced
   that with our own data on how each industry actually responds.

   With some industries, like Retail, people’s perception and reality
   matched up quite nicely. However, other perceptions were more
   disparate. For instance, people perceive Media and Entertainment as the
   third most responsive industry—but in reality they are the least
   responsive.

   As we’ve highlighted in previous reports, the industry is plagued by
   promotions with little to no response strategy on social. Another
   interesting disparity in perception and reality is the Utilities
   industry. People think that they’re unresponsive (ranked #14 of 15) but
   in reality, they are the most responsive of all industries.

   Digging deeper into the data, we can see not just where each industry
   lands on the responsiveness spectrum, but also how their audience is
   reaching out to them and how promotional their accounts are. As a
   refresh, here’s what each metric means:
     * Response Rate = the percentage of consumer messages needing a
       response that actually get one
     * Response Time = how long brands take (in hours) to respond to the
       consumer messages that need a response
     * % Needs Response = how many messages brands receive on social that
       require a response (based on Sprout’s algorithm, which analyzes
       identifiers such as question marks, @mentions and keywords)
     * Posts per Replies = how many promotional messages brands publish
       compared to how many responses they give to their audience
     * Brand Index Rank = how responsive brands are to consumers
     * Consumer Index Rank = how vocal consumers are with brands

Sprout Stance

     Your followers aren’t interested in overtly promotional social
     content or poorly received puns. They want to be informed through
     content that’s adjacent to your industry and relevant to their
     interests. They want to be engaged with, talked to and recognized.
     If the customer is always right, why aren’t you listening?

     Brands need to start reevaluating their resources to better serve
     their audience’s needs. With the right team, plan and tools in
     place, you can start building out a social strategy that converts
     instead of annoys. Hiring a content team made up of journalists and
     not marketers is the first step in the right direction. While a
     million dollar budget isn’t necessary, a content distribution plan
     that includes paid social is clearly a must-have if you want to
     succeed in reiterating your brand message and prompting followers to
     buy your product. When it comes to social media management, consider
     a tool that allows you to effortlessly respond.

     The data doesn’t lie. Social media impacts your brand’s bottom line,
     and the longer it takes your brand to reevaluate its resources and
     recognize that, the more money you’re losing.

About the Data

   The Sprout Social Index is a report compiled and released by Sprout
   Social. All referenced data is based on 257,000 public social profiles
   (103,000 Facebook; 114,000 Twitter; 40,000 Instagram) of continually
   active accounts between Q2 2015 and Q2 2016. More than 2.9 billion
   messages sent and received during that time were analyzed for the
   purposes of this report.

   Some data may have shifted from the last Sprout Social Index report due
   to a shift in the social profiles analyzed; however, all overarching
   trends remain consistent. Industry classifications were based on
   LinkedIn industry categories. In some cases, closely related industries
   were merged into a single overarching industry. All messages analyzed
   that were considered casual mentions or not in need of a response were
   excluded from engagement, response rate and response time calculations
   with the intention of eliminating noise. Analysis of which messages
   required attention was done using Sprout’s proprietary technologies.
   Response time and response rate calculations were done using Sprout’s
   Engagement Reporting technology found in the Sprout Social product.

   This consumer survey was conducted by Survata, an independent research
   firm in San Francisco. Survata interviewed 1,022 online respondents
   between July 05, 2016 and July 11, 2016. For further information, visit
   www.survata.com.

Best times to post on social media for 2019

   Photo of the author, Elizabeth Arens by Elizabeth Arens

   Social media is always evolving, and users’ behavior changes with it.
   One fact that doesn’t change is that all social platforms move fast,
   with a constant stream of content vying for attention. You want to get
   the most eyes possible on your content and maximize engagement by
   knowing the best times to post on social networks.

   It’s not enough to guess when users might log in to a given network, or
   when audiences in your niche are hungriest for the latest information.
   Now that more and more brands from all kinds of industries realize the
   value of connecting with their audiences on social networks, it’s
   important to understand how your audience uses social platforms and
   what they want out of your content. An ecommerce brand may see social
   engagement follow daily and seasonal patterns of shopping engagement,
   while a corporate thought leadership account may see plenty of clicks
   at the start of the workday when readers are looking for inspiration.

   In order to get granular and find out the best times to publish on
   social media for four social media networks, we worked closely with
   Sprout’s data science team to pull this information based on our
   customers. The data below shows when our 25,000-plus Sprout customers
   were engaged the most (and least) across major networks and broken down
   by industry.

   Let’s take a look at the unique insights we found for the best times to
   post on each social network:
     * Best times to post on Facebook
     * Best times to post on Instagram
     * Best times to post on Twitter
     * Best times to post on LinkedIn
     * How we gathered this data

   Disclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan
   types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded in
   Central Time Zone (CST). Number of engagements represents total
   engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour
   time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level
   engagement times.

Automatically optimize publishing with Sprout Social

     Not sure about the best times to publish content for your audience?
     Sprout takes the guesswork out of scheduling social posts.

     Sprout’s patented ViralPost® technology analyzes your audience data
     and detects the most active times for authentic engagement, enabling
     you to automatically schedule content at the best times for your
     brand.

   …[H]aving Sprout to not only help schedule content but also know when
   the most optimal time to publish is, depending on the page or platform?
   It’s a game changer.

Best times to post on Facebook

   Facebook global engagement

   Facebook has over two billion active users, making it the most
   populated platform by far. This huge audience means there’s a major
   opportunity for organic engagement on Facebook, if you keep in mind the
   current Facebook algorithm. The changes in the algorithm in the last
   couple of years have emphasized friends, family and meaningful
   connection, so content that drives genuine engagement is your best bet.

   In addition to a content strategy that connects meaningfully with your
   audience, you’ll best meet this need for engagement by posting at the
   times when users are most active on the network.

   Here are the key data points we found for the best times to post on
   Facebook:
     * Best times to post to Facebook: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the best day to post on Facebook.
     * Most consistent engagement: Weekdays from 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday has the least amount of engagement for Facebook
       during the week.
     * Lowest engagement: Early mornings and evenings, before 7 a.m. and
       after 5 p.m. have the least amount of engagement per day.

What we learned

   As you’ll see with other social networks, mid-week is the peak period
   on Facebook. The middle of each weekday, from morning to mid-afternoon,
   are safe times to post, meaning engagement remains consistent
   throughout these blocks of time.

   While people frequently check in throughout the middle of the day to
   see what’s going on, the peak times are around lunch breaks. When
   people have more time to scroll through their Facebook feeds and dig
   into interesting posts, engagement rises correspondingly.

   On the other hand, late night and early evening along with weekend days
   bring in relatively low engagement. While people may check in or post a
   few updates from weekend activities in the middle of the day on
   Saturday, these times aren’t your best bet for reaching audiences.

Best times to post on Facebook for consumer goods

   Facebook consumer goods engagement

   Whether you’re promoting an online shopping experience or driving
   audiences to brick-and-mortar retail, Facebook plays a key part in your
   social strategy. In addition to your niche’s unique customer personas,
   find your audiences when they’re most active at these top times to post
   for consumer goods and retail:

   Disclaimer: Industry specific heat maps are more concentrated to show
   medium- and high-level engagement.
     * The best times for consumer goods brands to post to Facebook:
       Wednesday at 1 p.m. and Friday at 11 a.m.
     * Other high engagement times: Wednesday from 1–3 p.m, Friday from
       10–11 a.m. and Thursday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: weekdays from 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 10 p.m.–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for media

   Facebook media engagement

   Social is a crowded space for media companies vying for attention, and
   the Facebook algorithm can make it especially difficult to find a place
   on users’ feeds. Tap into these times to post to boost engagement:
     * The best times for media companies to post on Facebook: Tuesday at
       5 p.m. and Friday from 8–9 a.m.
     * Other top times: Wednesday from 8–9 a.m., Wednesday at 5 p.m. and
       Thursday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday 9 a.m.-5 p.m
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 10 p.m.–3 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for education

   Facebook education engagement

   Facebook can be a great source of information for education
   institutions. Compared to other industries, mornings and nights offer
   stronger opportunities for schools’ social media content to get seen,
   as well as some spikes in activity on the weekend. Check out the full
   details of the best times to post on Facebook for education:
     * The best times for schools to post on Facebook: Wednesday at 9 a.m.
       and Saturday at 5 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 9 a.m–3 p.m,
       with the peak occurring between 9 a.m.–12 p.m. on those days.
     * Saturday from 12 p.m.-9.pm is also highly active.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday has the least engagement, and the lowest
       engagement times for schools are every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for nonprofit

   Facebook nonprofit engagement

   Facebook is a great place to highlight a nonprofit’s mission with
   longer form posts and discussions, as well as drawing attention to
   upcoming events. We found that nonprofits on Facebook frequently see
   the most engagement during weekday mornings.
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Facebook: Wednesday at 8–9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times: Thursday at 10 a.m. and Friday 8-10
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday show the least engagement
       per day, and with the worst times being 10 p.m.–5 a.m. every day.

Best times to post on Facebook for tech

   Facebook tech engagement

   Even with challenges in gaining organic engagement, Facebook is still
   an essential part of tech companies’ social strategy. Whether you’re
   looking to tap into conversations geared towards a B2B audience or a
   B2C one, top times for tech companies to post on Facebook include:
     * The best time for tech companies to post to Facebook: Wednesday at
       10 a.m.
     * Wednesday from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. is a peak time during the week as
       well.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday 8 a.m.–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 6 p.m–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for healthcare

   Facebook healthcare engagement

   Social audiences increasingly expect healthcare practices to have a
   social presence. Facebook is a great place to highlight your local
   practice and provide essential info to current and prospective
   patients. The best times to post for healthcare to reach these
   audiences include:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Facebook:
       Wednesday at 9–10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m.–3 or
       4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Avoid Saturday and Sunday, which have minimal
       engagement, and every day from 9 p.m.–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram

   Instagram global engagement

   Having recently grown to one billion monthly active users, and a median
   1.60% engagement rate per post, Instagram is definitely on the rise in
   the social space. The network has also debuted a number of new features
   recently, expanding the options for how users can interact with posts
   on this visual-first platform.

   Similar to Facebook’s 2018 focus on a more authentic and
   personal-feeling social experience, the Instagram algorithm in 2019
   prioritizes certain posts algorithmically in a user’s feed, marking a
   change from the previous reverse chronological order. In addition to
   the main feed, Stories has grown significantly since its 2016 launch,
   and 2018 also brought the debut of Instagram TV. Taken together, all of
   these options let brands create engaging video content of both
   micro-length and long-form templates.

   With all of these ways to reach an audience, plus Instagram’s notable
   focus on retail, you’ll want to know these key stats for the best times
   for brands to post on Instagram:
     * Best times to post on Instagram: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and Friday at
       10–11 a.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the overall best day to post to Instagram
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday receives the least amount of engagement on
       Instagram
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs during late night and early morning from
       11 p.m.–3 a.m.

What we learned

   While Instagram engagement peaks mid-day and mid-week, similar to the
   other major social networks, there are a few opportune windows found in
   the evening and morning during the middle of the week. While the safest
   times to post are still during those core weekday times, it could be
   well worth it for certain brand niches to consider if your audiences
   are among those reaching for the ‘Gram first thing in the morning or
   last thing before sleeping.

   While there is a bit of increased engagement around midday on Saturday,
   weekends aren’t your best bet for getting eyes on your posts.
   Similarly, even those late night users eventually pack it in, with
   engagement dropping in the latest hours of the night and earliest hours
   of the morning

Best times to post on Instagram for consumer goods

   instagram consumer goods engagement

   Over the past year, Instagram has cemented its role as a top network
   for shopping. This means that any retail or shopping business can’t
   afford to ignore the platform. Improve your chances of cutting through
   the noise in this busy space by keeping in mind the top times to post
   on Instagram for consumer goods and retail:
     * The best time for consumer brands to post on Instagram: Wednesday
       at 3 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
     * Another higher engagement time period occurs on Saturday around 10
       a.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday has the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m–3 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for media

   instagram media engagement

   As Instagram expands its video offerings, it’s becoming a unique
   channel for media companies to highlight their best visual content. Our
   findings show that Instagram’s audience taps in a bit earlier in the
   day for media content than other industries, so consider these times to
   post when planning to highlight your best content:
     * The best time for media companies to post on Instagram: Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m–4
       p.m.
     * There’s also a period of higher engagement that lasts all the way
       through Thursday night into Friday morning. It’s lower than the
       highest peak times, but it could be a unique time to capture
       audiences that aren’t active in other industries’ niches.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday have the least engagement
       for media companies on Instagram.

Best times to post on Instagram for education

   instagram education engagement

   For colleges and schools, Instagram is a great opportunity to build
   your visual identity and highlight on-campus experiences. Engagement
   patterns trend a bit later in the day for education as the
   student-heavy audience starts getting on their phones in the later
   afternoon. Here are the best times to post for educational institutions
   on Instagram:
     * The best time to post on Instagram for schools: Friday at 10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Saturday at 10 a.m.–8
       p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday at 11 a.m., Friday
       from 11 a.m.–12 p.m. and 2 p.m., and Saturday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 11 p.m–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for nonprofit

   instagram nonprofit engagement

   Instagram is the perfect complement to the rest of your nonprofit’s
   social strategy. If you’ve promoted an event ahead of time on Facebook,
   follow up on Instagram to show off photos from the event and start
   building your brand’s visual identity. Keep in mind these peak times to
   post for nonprofits:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post to Instagram: Wednesday at 2
       p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Monday from 2–3 p.m., Tuesday
       from 1–3 p.m. and a relatively strong block of time on Saturday
       from 1–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday gets the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for tech

   instagram tech engagement

   Trends for the tech industry vary somewhat from the global peak times
   on Instagram, with audiences tuning into their feeds for bursts of
   activity earlier in the day. Take these peak times into account for
   your content planning as you highlight your products, services and
   company culture on Instagram:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Instagram: Wednesday at
       6 a.m. and 9 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday from 10–11 a.m., Friday from
       7–10 a.m., and Saturday from 7–11 a.m.
     * There’s also fairly high opportunity for engagement on Tuesday at
       10 p.m., and both Wednesday and Friday mornings show more
       engagement than other industries at these early hours.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday had the least engagement overall for tech
       companies.

Best times to post on Instagram for healthcare

   instagram healthcare engagement

   It’s clear from our findings that Instagram still isn’t a priority for
   many healthcare practices. However, considering the high engagement it
   drives for many other industries, it’s clear that audiences, including
   prospective patients, are on the platform. It’s well worth it to expand
   your reach by planning around these times to post:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Instagram:
       Tuesday at 8 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday from 7 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Evening and overnight every day from 6 p.m.–6
       a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter

   Twitter global engagement

   Twitter presents a huge opportunity for brands to connect directly with
   audiences and manage customer care.

   This means timeliness is key on Twitter. While the social network
   selectively highlights some activity out of chronological sequence
   based on user interests, most people are still scrolling through to
   catch up on the latest posts and musings from their group of followed
   accounts. Posting at off-peak hours could and cause you to miss out on
   a lot of your potential engagement.

   With 500 million tweets sent per day, Twitter provides a goldmine of
   social opinions and conversation that can inform your brand strategy.
   In addition to using Twitter listening to know what topics offer the
   most opportunity to engage, you’ll want to keep in mind these stats for
   when to post on Twitter:
     * Best times to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Best days: Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days to post on
       Twitter.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–4
       p.m.
     * Worst day: Saturday gets the least engagement.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs every day from 10 p.m–4 a.m.

What we learned

   Twitter heats up a bit earlier in the morning, probably as audiences
   are starting to go about their day and take a moment to catch up on and
   digest the biggest news and updates from their areas of interest. The
   peak times of engagement also carry into the lunch hour, and begin to
   taper slightly through the late afternoon and evening, finally dropping
   off as late night approaches.

   Like other social networks, mid-week on Tuesday and Wednesday are your
   top days to post on Twitter, and engagement drops off on weekends. We
   do still see that morning check-in occurring around 9 on both Saturday
   and Sunday, just to a lesser extent.

Best times to post on Twitter for consumer goods

   twitter consumer goods engagement

   Twitter is an essential customer care channel for retailers and
   ecommerce businesses. Compared to Facebook and Instagram engagement,
   activity actually builds during the weekend rather than falling off.
   This could indicate that users are online for answers and help about
   products they’ve been putting off during the week, or seeking info to
   complement a shopping trip or outing. Either way, quick response times
   are essential when people take time on days off to reach out to your
   brand, so be ready for these peak times:
     * The best time for consumer goods brands to post to Twitter: Sunday
       at 11 a.m.
     * Other peak engagement times include Saturday at 3 p.m. and
       Wednesday at 1 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Sunday from 9 a.m.–3 p.m. or Monday
       through Wednesday from 12 p.m–3 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Friday is the day with the lowest engagement,
       and the worst times for consumer goods each day are between 10
       p.m–6 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for media

   twitter media engagement

   Twitter has become a go-to platform for journalists, authors and
   experts to share ideas and opinions—often around the clock. We saw this
   reflected in the hotspot of activity that lasts throughout the night
   from Thursday through Friday morning. There are still some other peak
   times you’ll want to know about if you’re looking to get your top
   stories and content in front of Twitter users:
     * The best times for media companies to post on Twitter: Thursday at
       9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Thursday from 4 p.m–8 p.m. and
       Friday from 7 a.m.–11 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: All day Saturday.

Best times to post on Twitter for education

   twitter education engagement

   Educational institutions can take a unique approach to Twitter by
   segmenting out different parts of their social stream with separate
   Twitter accounts for everything from sports teams to dining services.
   As with other social networks for education, the peak times are shifted
   a bit from the global top times, so adjust to the unique schedules of
   your students with these top times to post:
     * The best time for schools to post on Twitter: Saturday at 5 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Saturday from 1 p.m.–10 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Safe times to post during the week
       include Wednesday from 8 a.m.–12 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and early morning every day from 12
       a.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for nonprofit

   twitter nonprofit engagement

   Nonprofits have a great opportunity to build up their community on
   Twitter and start conversations with the audiences most engaged with
   their causes. Keep in mind these key times to post for nonprofits on
   Twitter:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 7
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday from 6 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday get the least engagement, as
       well as every day between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for tech

   twitter tech engagement

   It’s no surprise the tech industry is consistently active throughout
   the week on Twitter. Whether you have one or multiple accounts
   conducting customer service, promoting your brand or sharing thought
   leadership, consider using social listening or Twitter advanced search
   features to tap into the topics your audiences are discussing. Consider
   these top times for the tech industry to get active on Twitter:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Twitter: Tuesday at 9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include the rest of the morning on
       Tuesday from 7–10 a.m. and Wednesday from 8-10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–1
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday are the days that get the
       least engagement, and it’s also lower from 6 p.m to 5 a.m. every
       day.

Best times to post on Twitter for healthcare

   twitter healthcare engagement

   As we’ve emphasized, Twitter is ideal for conversation and customer
   care. Health questions can be the most pressing of all, so whether it’s
   an account for a local practice or a major pharmaceutical brand, be
   ready for your audiences by being aware of the best times for
   healthcare accounts on Twitter:
     * The best times for healthcare practices and business to post on
       Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
     * Other notably high engagement times include Monday at 2 p.m.,
       Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Friday at 8 a.m. There’s also
       additional engagement on Wednesday morning compared to other
       weekday mornings.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: The day with the least engagement is Sunday.

Best times to post on LinkedIn

   times to post for linkedin

   LinkedIn targets a more specific audience than other social networks,
   and as it continues to grow, we’ve gotten a fuller picture of the best
   times to post compared to our overview in 2018. In order to provide the
   greatest accuracy, we didn’t break down this data into individual
   industries.

   The network’s more niche audience is no reason to ignore its marketing
   power, however. These motivated users tend to generate more leads,
   especially for B2B marketing. Here’s our findings on the best times to
   post on LinkedIn:
     * The best times to post to LinkedIn: Wednesday at 9–10 a.m. and 12
       p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–2
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs on Sunday and the least popular times to
       post are every day from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.

What we learned

   Considering LinkedIn’s corporate-minded mix of thought leaders, job
   seekers and company page curation, it’s no surprise that activity is
   much more concentrated around workdays. Activity ramps up on Tuesday as
   people get through the Monday rush, and tapers fairly uniformly after 3
   p.m. as the last tasks of the workday take priority.

   Weekends garner fairly low engagement, which is expected as people step
   away from their devices and desks on Saturday and Sunday.

How we gathered the data

   We understand that these type of reports can raise questions about just
   where the data is coming from. That’s why we want to be clear about the
   data we pulled and how we got here.

   First off, we were luckily enough to work with Sprout Social’s very own
   data science team to gather together this information from our
   customers. Joel Booth, a Senior Data Scientist at Sprout, explained how
   it all works.

   “Sprout integrates with the different social media platforms via their
   API, which allows the application to receive messages on behalf of our
   customers,” Booth said. “Essentially, this is how we power features
   such as Sprout’s Smart Inbox and Reports.”

Using ViralPost to publish at the best times

   Our data team is constantly collecting data. And this information isn’t
   just used to put together amazing reports like you’ve read above. In
   fact, Sprout Social’s very own ViralPost works off this data regularly
   for our customers.
   ViralPost hones in on the best times to post on social media

   Booth further explained that Sprout’s proprietary algorithm analyzes
   the publishing history of our customers and collects data on how and
   when their audiences engage. This is what makes ViralPost so unique—it
   allows users to find future times to post that work best for their
   channels.

   “ViralPost is an opportunity for the data science team to not only make
   our customers’ social efforts more effective, but also easier,” Booth
   said. “The algorithm can look at more messages, more engagements and
   more factors over a far wider range of time than a person in order to
   pinpoint those ideal times to send a message and how those times change
   week to week.”

   Simply put, having publishing times is extremely handy, but why not use
   a tool that can publish during the suggested times? ViralPost works
   with actual customer data, just like what we’ve pulled to assemble this
   report, to give you the best opportunity for your individual account.

Introduction

   Whether new to the industry or building on years of experience, it’s
   easy for businesses to fall into the trap of employing ineffective
   social media advertising practices.

   People come to social platforms to keep up with friends, learn
   something new and experience a range of emotions. Given the sheer
   volume of content in this space, brands will miss their opportunity to
   reach new audiences if their ads can’t cut through the clutter. It
   takes a combination of arresting creative and relevant targeting to
   break through in the feed—especially since consumers are often biased
   against ads.

   It’s true, people don’t welcome ads with open arms. In fact, our survey
   of more than 1,000 Americans found that their collective perception of
   social advertising has mostly stagnated or declined in the past year.
   This indicates that when on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and
   Twitter, a majority of consumers aren’t finding much that stops them
   from scrolling right past brands’ ads.
   social media advertising - decline in public perception

   And while 39% of consumers attributed their declined perception of
   social ads to recent political events, the top reason for the drop
   cited by 58% of respondents was simply seeing too many social ads
   overall.

   With the wealth of data and targeting options out there, social should
   open doors to hyper-relevant advertising. But this paradox of choices
   has overwhelmed, rather than empowered, many marketers on the path to
   producing better ads.

   How can marketers break the mold on social and create ads that drive
   conversions, conversations and maybe even a viral hit? The coveted
   scroll-stopper ad doesn’t necessarily include the flashiest celebrity
   or the most provocative tagline.

   What does it involve? Read on for new data that breaks down what makes
   people take action on social ads.

Entertain Me

   Entertainment has always been a hallmark of marketing. Advertising
   great Leo Burnett even cautioned marketers about forgetting that
   fact—as he put it, “one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not
   that of misleading people, but that of boring them to death.”

   While this philosophy seems obvious, most social ads fail to put it
   into practice. It’s clear that to succeed on social, marketers must go
   back to basics when developing their ads.

   By and large, entertainment is still the single best way to stop the
   scroll, with 41% of people reporting that entertaining content makes
   them more likely to engage with a social ad.
   most engaging social ad content

   But what does “entertainment” mean in practice?

   Good news: It doesn’t necessarily require the creative resources of a
   global conglomerate, but it does call for an investment in visually
   driven content.

   On social in general, Sprout research shows that video is one of the
   main formats people want to see from brands (83%). GIFs also perform
   well with 58% of people enjoying them—among Millennials, this rises to
   70%. Brands that go beyond stylized product shots and into content that
   inspires emotion in prospective customers will have more success being
   noticed and remembered.

   These messages also don’t have to be delivered by a paid third party,
   whether a celebrity or a niche influencer. This might surprise many
   marketers. After all, isn’t partnering up with influencers a great way
   to introduce your brand to potential customers and deliver unique
   content?

   Sort of. Though the popularity of influencer marketing has created
   thousands of professional entertainers working in social, an influencer
   partnership isn’t the only route to engagement. People are more
   interested in seeing ads from brands than from influencers—57% to 43%,
   respectively. Our findings underscore a preference for transparency,
   with advertising coming straight from the brand itself.

Sprout Stance: Here We Are Now, Entertain Us

     When brands turn to social to build top-of-funnel awareness—in the
     paid or organic realms—entertainment can open the door. Invest in a
     social team or resources that support creative multimedia content
     development, driving an introduction to your brand that intrigues
     and attracts customers. Whether it’s branding a character like The
     Most Interesting Man or crafting a short video with an inspiring
     message, your team must have the internal buy-in to develop and
     iterate on concepts that will drive greater results than your
     average product shot.

Educate Me

   While building awareness is important, ensuring potential customers
   understand what your brand offers is just as crucial. The latter
   requires that consumers make personal connections with your brand—they
   might appreciate your differentiators, share the values you’re
   communicating or learn a new skill that your offering enables. This
   type of advertising makes people feel good about your products and
   confident in choosing your brand over others. So what kind of content
   can help?

   Education. Our survey found that a third of people are more likely to
   engage with social ads that teach them something.

   No wonder Tasty’s rapid-fire recipe videos had such a meteoric rise.
   Whether it’s a recipe video, a style tutorial or a behind-the-scenes
   look at how products are crafted, educational content positions your
   brand as a resource and leaves consumers wanting more.

   Furthermore, people who would engage with a social ad that interested
   them aren’t looking to buy directly—instead, 65% of consumers will
   click through to learn more. People want ads that promise further
   education, whether it’s about the product, subject matter or an
   adjacent topic.
   social media advertising - actions consumers take

   There’s even more good news: where opinion of social ads is declining,
   it’s often because the content is uninteresting (31%) and irrelevant
   (26%). Creating educational content that adds value to consumers’
   social experiences naturally addresses these two areas of
   dissatisfaction.

Sprout Stance: Embrace the CTE

     That’s call to education. Remember, most people aren’t logging onto
     popular social channels to shop. Rather, they seek a social
     experience. That’s why CTAs centered around education and learning
     are a solid bet: read more, watch more, learn more. This is great
     for brands, as it’s another opportunity to add value into routine
     interactions and remain top of mind until people are ready to
     convert.

     Educational ads hold value after consumers have made a purchase as
     well—in particular for big-ticket items, such as a car, that only
     come around every few years or decade. In the interim period, fresh
     content reinforces the positive emotions a consumer felt when he or
     she made the original purchase. Content that showcases new or
     unexpected uses also helps the item continue to add value in
     consumers’ eyes. Cultivating brand loyalty and advocacy over time
     requires educating your existing audience about what differentiates
     your brand—something your paid and organic social programs can
     tackle in tandem.

Give Me a Break

   Social has opened the floodgates to new types of creative ad
   experiences, but there’s one advertising classic that never gets old:
   discounts.

   While entertainment may be king, it should come as no surprise that
   across generations, 37% of people are more likely to engage with social
   ads that save them money.

   However, segmenting generational preferences shows a shift among Baby
   Boomers, who actually rank discounts as their top motivator.
   Conversely, younger social users don’t want their first impression of a
   brand to scream “BUY NOW!”
   social media ad content - preferences by generation

   While the decision to offer a discount may require buy-in from others
   in your organization, the ability to communicate value is always on the
   table. Given Baby Boomers’ preference for discounts and educational
   content, there’s an opportunity to combine the two into stories and
   messaging that highlights your value proposition and connects with this
   generation, even if there’s no immediate sale.

   Every campaign should open with one question: Who are you trying to
   reach?

   If this isn’t something you can easily and confidently answer, go back
   to the basics. Knowing that Millennials care less about saving money
   than they do about being entertained and making an emotional connection
   to brands—and that Boomers are looking to save cold hard cash—there’s
   no reason to blanket a diverse range of audiences with a single
   message.

   As the adage goes, price communicates value. If you know which
   audiences truly desire discounts, you can be judicious with your
   financial incentives—and offer them to the right groups.

Sprout Stance: Try, Test & Try Again

     The golden rule is this: Know your audience and use the tools at
     your disposal to speak directly to them. Otherwise, you’re
     practically inviting people to scroll right past your ads on social.

     But knowing what types of ads motivate your audience to action is
     just one piece of the puzzle. The other is delivering those ads to
     the right people at the right time. No matter what creative you
     use—and whether you’re offering discounts, entertainment or
     education—the most effective ad is always a relevant one.

     The best way to ensure your ads make a personalized impact is to
     understand the specific audience you’re trying to reach. Then you
     can tailor your message and target accordingly. Test your messaging
     across different paid audiences to understand what resonates, then
     iterate based on those results to ensure budget, strategy and
     consumer expectations are in alignment.

Don't Assume You Know Me—Prove It

   The common denominator across all our findings is “me, me, me.” That
   shouldn’t be surprising.

   Getting to know your audience in depth and breadth demonstrates a
   commitment to seeing them as real people instead of sales targets. The
   consumer research process also ensures a more strategic use of your
   marketing budget to gain a competitive edge.

   The stakes have never been higher: 93% of firms are investing marketing
   budget in Facebook, 67% in Instagram and 51% in Twitter, according to
   Hanapin Marketing.

   Bottom line: If you’re going to spend, be diligent and be social. Get
   inside your consumers’ heads — and know exactly what inspires them to
   take action.

Introduction

   A little brother poking you incessantly. The aggravating beat of that
   bad song. Another brand trying to sell you something on social media?

   Most marketers think they know what their audience wants, but rarely do
   they ask. Social media is no different. Some brands can be straight up
   annoying on social media. Whether it’s pounding promotions or spouting
   awkward jokes, brands just don’t know how to strike the right tone.

   But it doesn’t have to be that way. The truth is that 86% of social
   media users want to and do follow brands on social. But when they do,
   they’re most often looking for relevant content, not another
   cringe-worthy post from an out of touch company.

   For this report, Sprout surveyed more than 1,000 Facebook, Twitter and
   Instagram users to determine what annoys them about brands on social,
   what drives them to unfollow and which industries are on the right side
   of the line.

   Chapter 2

The Annoyance Factor Is Real

   From ignoring customers to trendjacking the term bae, a brand’s social
   posts can be just as irritating as the obnoxious shares from your aunt.

Give The People What They Want

   The issue is not that people don’t welcome brand presence on social,
   it’s that many brands are applying social tactics that don’t correlate
   with what people want.

   If you think that people are flocking to your brand’s Facebook Page for
   BOGO deals and coupons, think again. While 86% of social media users
   follow a brand, nearly 60% of them are annoyed with too many promotions
   by brands. The perils of over-promotion only escalate if brands are
   unresponsive. In fact, 1 in 4 people are annoyed when you don’t respond
   to them. And seeing as only 1 in 10 messages on social actually get a
   reply from brands, it’s likely that you’re ticking off a lot of fans.

   One-sided content isn’t the sole annoyance. People are also taking
   notice of the tone and content of social profiles that just don’t seem
   to fit. Trying to convince a younger demographic that your legacy brand
   is hip by inserting “on fleek” and other casual chatter into your
   posts? You’ll be better off if you stick to being yourself. 38% of
   people find the use of slang to be irritating and another 32% are
   annoyed when a brand tries to be funny–when they clearly are not.

   All that said, you do need to understand and maintain a brand
   personality because 34% of people find a lack of personality to be just
   as bad.

Sprout Stance

     The Mad Men era is over. Don Draper shouldn’t be managing your
     Facebook Page and the creative for your Tweets shouldn’t mimic a
     print advertisement. Regardless of your budget, competition for
     capturing your followers’ attention is steep. Each one of your
     social posts is up against a backdrop of cat GIFs, political
     viewpoints and compelling vacation photos.

     Instead of bombarding social feeds with stock images or forced copy,
     do the work: Identify your brand values, collect data, identify
     audiences and target your content accordingly. Additionally, pull
     together guidelines that steer clear of over-played phrases and stay
     true to your brand’s personality.

   Chapter 3

From Uncouth to Unfollow

   Being annoyed is one thing, but what causes people to actually unfollow
   a brand?

To Follow or Not to Follow?

   Being annoyed is one thing, but what causes people to actually unfollow
   a brand? First, let’s explore what gets them to follow you in the first
   place. 73% of people surveyed said that liking a brand on social starts
   with being interested in a brand’s products or services.

   Outside of basic interest, people want something more from your brand.
   The majority of followers will come to your social profile looking for
   deals and promotions (58%) or incentives (42%). However, as we quickly
   uncovered, neither tactic will get them to stick around. Keep that in
   mind as you’re developing your social strategy–create content that
   actually means something to your audience.

   Furthermore, 25% of people started following you so they could have a
   two-way dialogue with your brand. People want to interact with your
   brand, so ensure you’re set up for success in social customer care.

   While interest or incentive may bring the bulk of people to your
   brand’s profile, it won’t keep them there. Too many promotional
   messages not only annoy followers, they also cause 46% of people to
   unfollow a brand.

   And in case you needed further proof that a dynamic content strategy is
   a necessity, 41% of people will unfollow a brand that doesn’t share
   relevant information. So expand your tactics and be sure you’re
   diversifying your social content strategy. Whether that’s through
   curating thoughtful third-party content, sharing more user-generated
   content, participating in co-marketing opportunities or engaging your
   communities with interactive quizzes and contests.

   That relevancy takes on even more weight when you consider that 7 in 10
   people have unfollowed a brand because they were embarrassed their
   friends might see. People just don’t want to be associated with brands
   that are antiquated or ridiculous. While your social profile might not
   be the full story, a brand refresh on that platform might help your
   overall perception.

Sprout Stance

     When it’s time to measure the impact of your social media efforts,
     do follower counts matter or are they just vanity metrics? The truth
     this that while the quality of your followers is definitely more
     important than the quantity, any shifts in volume speak to a larger
     trend with your brand. Too many self-promotional or irrelevant posts
     alienate your audience and prompts them to leave your social
     channels. If you’re producing relevant, engaging content, your
     community will organically grow.

   Chapter 4

Repetition Improves Community Receptivity

   As social media marketers, we’re constantly proving the ROI of social
   media and making valiant attempts to better tie it to direct sales. But
   how many people actually purchase something because they see it on
   social? And, how long does this sales process take?

Unforgettable Content is Recycled Content

   A staggering 75% of people have purchased something because they saw it
   on social media. But how many times do they actually need to see a post
   before they make the purchase?

   Most people have to see a product or service 2-4 times on social before
   they purchase it. And nearly 20% of people need to see a social post or
   advertisement 5-8 times. Purchasing decisions prompted by social take
   time. That’s why it’s important your brand is focused maintaining a
   steady community of invested followers and analyzing the metrics that
   can better inform your social content strategy.

   Again, brands have to navigate a delicate balance between informing
   their audiences and bombarding them. While you want to ensure your
   audience sees that post a few times, you can’t hit them over the head
   with promotions for fear they’ll click that unfollow button. Because
   our survey found that 57% of people are more likely to buy from a brand
   that they follow on social, you’ll want to keep those followers.

Sprout Stance

     If 57% of people who follow you on social media are likely to buy
     something from your brand and most people need to see a post 2-4
     times on social before they make a purchase, why wouldn’t you better
     target your followers with multiple messages? In order to be
     successful, your social strategy has to aim to solidify your brand
     recognition. You need to ensure that your followers are seeing your
     posts more than once.

     That being said, you don’t want to bombard your audience with the
     exact same messaging over and over again. Minimally edit and revise
     your social post in order to keep your followers attentive and
     engaged. Change the headline or photo for a blog article you’re
     posting on Facebook. Link to your website by including a different
     quote or data point in your Tweet. Try posting the same product
     photo on Instagram in different settings and environments and make
     sure to include an updated caption.

     A strategic paid and organic social distribution plan will better
     target your content and put it in front of potential fans who are
     interested in your brand. Make sure your approach is balanced and
     that, regardless of whether a post is paid or organic, it’s
     providing your followers with value.

   Chapter 5

Tell Us What You Really Think

   Consumer perceptions don't always match a marketer's reality. That's
   why we wanted to determine which industries people found annoying and
   compare that to our own data around posting behavior.

Retail Gets It Right

   We wanted to determine which industries people found annoying and
   compare that to our own data around posting behavior.

   On the flip side, the Government is considered the most annoying
   industry on social media by those surveyed. This isn’t surprising when
   you consider that it takes the industry 10.7 hours on average to
   respond to consumers.

   Banking/Finance came out in second place in the annoyance factor.
   Preconceived notions about the industry as a whole clearly play a role,
   since they’re actually the second most responsive industry according to
   our data.

   Perception and reality are often very different. Therefore, we took a
   look at how brands’ responsiveness was perceived and cross-referenced
   that with our own data on how each industry actually responds.

   With some industries, like Retail, people’s perception and reality
   matched up quite nicely. However, other perceptions were more
   disparate. For instance, people perceive Media and Entertainment as the
   third most responsive industry—but in reality they are the least
   responsive.

   As we’ve highlighted in previous reports, the industry is plagued by
   promotions with little to no response strategy on social. Another
   interesting disparity in perception and reality is the Utilities
   industry. People think that they’re unresponsive (ranked #14 of 15) but
   in reality, they are the most responsive of all industries.

   Digging deeper into the data, we can see not just where each industry
   lands on the responsiveness spectrum, but also how their audience is
   reaching out to them and how promotional their accounts are. As a
   refresh, here’s what each metric means:
     * Response Rate = the percentage of consumer messages needing a
       response that actually get one
     * Response Time = how long brands take (in hours) to respond to the
       consumer messages that need a response
     * % Needs Response = how many messages brands receive on social that
       require a response (based on Sprout’s algorithm, which analyzes
       identifiers such as question marks, @mentions and keywords)
     * Posts per Replies = how many promotional messages brands publish
       compared to how many responses they give to their audience
     * Brand Index Rank = how responsive brands are to consumers
     * Consumer Index Rank = how vocal consumers are with brands

Sprout Stance

     Your followers aren’t interested in overtly promotional social
     content or poorly received puns. They want to be informed through
     content that’s adjacent to your industry and relevant to their
     interests. They want to be engaged with, talked to and recognized.
     If the customer is always right, why aren’t you listening?

     Brands need to start reevaluating their resources to better serve
     their audience’s needs. With the right team, plan and tools in
     place, you can start building out a social strategy that converts
     instead of annoys. Hiring a content team made up of journalists and
     not marketers is the first step in the right direction. While a
     million dollar budget isn’t necessary, a content distribution plan
     that includes paid social is clearly a must-have if you want to
     succeed in reiterating your brand message and prompting followers to
     buy your product. When it comes to social media management, consider
     a tool that allows you to effortlessly respond.

     The data doesn’t lie. Social media impacts your brand’s bottom line,
     and the longer it takes your brand to reevaluate its resources and
     recognize that, the more money you’re losing.

About the Data

   The Sprout Social Index is a report compiled and released by Sprout
   Social. All referenced data is based on 257,000 public social profiles
   (103,000 Facebook; 114,000 Twitter; 40,000 Instagram) of continually
   active accounts between Q2 2015 and Q2 2016. More than 2.9 billion
   messages sent and received during that time were analyzed for the
   purposes of this report.

   Some data may have shifted from the last Sprout Social Index report due
   to a shift in the social profiles analyzed; however, all overarching
   trends remain consistent. Industry classifications were based on
   LinkedIn industry categories. In some cases, closely related industries
   were merged into a single overarching industry. All messages analyzed
   that were considered casual mentions or not in need of a response were
   excluded from engagement, response rate and response time calculations
   with the intention of eliminating noise. Analysis of which messages
   required attention was done using Sprout’s proprietary technologies.
   Response time and response rate calculations were done using Sprout’s
   Engagement Reporting technology found in the Sprout Social product.

   This consumer survey was conducted by Survata, an independent research
   firm in San Francisco. Survata interviewed 1,022 online respondents
   between July 05, 2016 and July 11, 2016. For further information, visit
   www.survata.com.

Calculando los mejores momentos para publicar en las redes sociales

   Photo of the author, Alex York by Alex York

   Administrar todas las redes sociales puede ser una tarea agobiante.
   Saber cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en redes sociales es aún
   más desafiante. Solo basta con preguntar a cualquier administrador de
   redes sociales cuánto esfuerzo requiere estar encima de cada red.

   Administrar estas comunidades requiere de conocimiento y una cuota
   justa de corazonadas. Al administrar varias cuentas, es difícil saber
   cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en redes sociales.

Por qué deberías saber cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en redes
sociales

   Saber cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en redes sociales puede
   marcar la diferencia entre un clic y 10 clics. Siempre ve a pescar
   donde hay pique.

   Si bien es fácil adivinar o elegir un horario específico, es más
   efectivo descubrir los periodos de tiempo en vez de momentos exactos.
   Confiar en un hora exacta puede ser una pérdida de tiempo, ya que la
   audiencia de cada empresa varía. No obstante, si se conocen todos los
   horarios posibles en el día, se puede simplificar la publicación.

   Echemos un vistazo a cada red principal y analicemos los mejores
   horarios para publicar en las redes sociales que encontramos:
     * Ir a Facebook
     * Ir a Twitter
     * Ir a Instagram
     * Ir a LinkedIn
     * Ir a Pinterest
     * Cómo recolectamos los datos

La mejor hora para publicar en Facebook

   best time to post on facebook graph

   Con prácticamente 1.18 mil millones de usuarios activos por mes,
   Facebook es el rey de las redes sociales. No obstante, es difícil
   colocar las publicaciones orgánicas en frente de toda tu audiencia
   debido al constante cambio del algoritmo de Facebook.

   Por este motivo, las marcas deben ser más estratégicas con respecto al
   horario del día en el que publicarán en Facebook. A través de las
   diferentes fuentes de datos, Facebook es realmente un punto activo
   todos los días de la semana. Si bien otras redes sociales tiene menos
   cantidad de días activos a lo largo de la semana, es poco probable que
   no encuentres un horario para publicar en Facebook.

   Sin embargo, hay algunos horarios, patrones y días destacados de la
   semana que podrían ayudarte. Algunos de los resultados indicaron lo
   siguiente:
   El
     * jueves es el día que más se recomienda para publicar
     * Jueves a la 1 p.m. es la hora más activa
     * Es relativamente seguro publicar en cualquier día entre 9 a.m. y 3
       p.m.
     * Bien temprano a la mañana y bien tarde a la noche son los horarios
       menos recomendados para publicar
     * Miércoles a domingo son los días más fuertes para publicar

3 cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en Facebook

   Facebook es único en el mundo del marketing por su tamaño así como la
   dificultad para interactuar. Por este motivo, se recomienda que sepas
   lo que publicarás de antemano. Aquí te contamos las tres cosas:
   facebook video gif

   1. Usar videos
   Los videos continúan dominando la visualización en Facebook. De hecho,
   un estudio de Socialbakers descubrió que las publicaciones de video en
   Facebook tienen un alcance orgánico de 8.71% en comparación con el
   5.77% de publicaciones de fotos. Además, los datos de Digiday develaron
   que algunas marcas ven que el 85% de las visualizaciones de sus videos
   en Facebook se realizan sin sonido. Es decir, debes publicar videos muy
   atractivos que no necesariamente dependen del audio. No te olvides del
   subtitulado, ya que el texto puede propiciar la interacción de los
   usuarios sin necesidad de sonido.
   facebook know what works gif

   2. Saber lo que funcionó en el pasado
   No compliques más las cosas al publicar contenido aleatorio en
   Facebook. En cambio, realiza un seguimiento de tu alcance total, me
   gusta, comentarios e interacciones con la herramienta de gestión de
   Facebook de Sprout Social. Detalla fácilmente las partes del contenido
   que funcionan mejor y aprovéchalas.
   short and sweet gif

   3. Las publicaciones deben ser cortas y concisas
   Facebook te permite escribir y publicar una novela, pero ¿tus
   seguidores realmente quieren leer eso? En cambio, BuzzSumo recomienda
   realizar publicaciones cortas y concisas con 0-50 caracteres. La red no
   es un lugar donde los usuarios dediquen mucho tiempo en cada
   publicación, por lo que las interacciones rápidas funcionan
   generalmente mejor.

El mejor horario para publicar en Twitter

   best time to post on twitter graph

   Twitter continúa siendo una de las maneras más rápidas en las que las
   empresas se comunican con los clientes a través de las redes sociales.
   De hecho, el Índice del 2.º trimestre de 2016 de Sprout Social develó
   que el 34.5% de los clientes prefieren las redes sociales como punto de
   contacto (el método con mejor calificación).

   Es muy importante saber cuál es el mejor horario para tuitear para que
   puedas optimizar el potencial máximo de audiencia cada día. Para
   conocer mejor la red, aquí te contamos algunos hechos interesantes
   sobre los mejores horarios para publicar en Twitter.
     *
          + Lunes a jueves son los días más fuertes para publicar

   El
     * jueves es el día que más se recomienda para realizar publicaciones
       en la semana
     * Mediodía del jueves es la hora más activa de la semana
     * Es relativamente seguro publicar en cualquier día hábil entre el
       mediodía y las 3 p.m.
     * Bien temprano a la mañana y bien tarde a la noche son los horarios
       menos recomendados para publicar

3 cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en Twitter

   Tal como lo mencionamos anteriormente, Twitter es complicado y se mueve
   a la velocidad de la luz. Además de ser astuto con el cronograma de
   publicación, también debes saber lo que estás publicando. Se recomienda
   pensar en la “calidad sobre la cantidad” como un hábito para las
   publicaciones en las redes sociales y esta idea se aplica a la
   publicación en Twitter. Antes de comenzar, te presentamos tres cosas
   que debes saber:
   twitter follow industry leaders gif

   1. Seguir a todos los líderes de la industria
   Independientemente de si tu industria es un nicho para la reparación de
   cámaras o es masiva como la atención de la salud, debes seguir todas
   las ventajas de la industria. Si sigues esta recomendación, podrás dar
   a conocer el nombre de tu marca y aumentar las posibilidades de
   interactuar con líderes de opinión de tu industria cuando hagas una
   publicación. Además, si sigues las recomendaciones de los mejores
   horarios para publicar en Twitter, tienes más posibilidades de dar en
   el blanco en el horario de visualización óptimo de los líderes de
   opinión, que, a su vez, te permitirá profundizar aún más tu alcance.
   twitter ready to engage gif

   2. Estar listos para interactuar
   Saber cuál es el mejor horario para tuitear es clave, pero también es
   muy importante estar listo para interactuar después de tuitear. Según
   el Índice del 3.º trimestre de 2016 de Sprout Social, el 57% de los
   usuarios se enoja cuando las marcas se promocionan demasiado en las
   redes sociales. Para Twitter intenta limitar el contenido promocional
   y, en cambio, prepárate para interactuar con los usuarios. Si se
   realiza correctamente, construirás mejores relaciones y aumentarás la
   confianza hacia tu marca.
   twitter clicks are critical gif

   3. Los clics son clave
   Según los datos de Shareaholic, se descubrió que Twitter es el más
   efectivo a la hora de impulsar clics en comparación de todas las demás
   redes sociales. Como es tan difícil obtener clics en Twitter en primer
   lugar, te debes asegurar de que tu contenido sea absolutamente
   atractivo y seleccionable. Usa las herramientas analíticas de Twitter
   para realizar un seguimiento de los clics en las publicaciones para que
   puedas saber qué contenido impulsa la interacción y cuál fracasa.

El mejor horario para publicar en Instagram

   best time to post on instagram graph

   Las marcas rápidamente descubrieron el poder de Instagram a la hora de
   impulsar la interacción en redes sociales, por lo que se ha convertido
   en una de las redes más populares. De hecho, los datos de Forrester
   develaron que Instagram tiene la mayor tasa de interacción por seguidor
   (2.2%) en comparación con cualquier otra red social (la segunda es
   Facebook con 0.22%).

   Con el gran potencial de interacción, un nuevo algoritmo de Instagram
   recientemente implementado y con una cantidad creciente de usuarios que
   se unen a diario, saber cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en
   Instagram podría marcar una verdadera diferencia en tu estrategia de
   marketing. Algunas de las cosas más importantes que aprendimos son las
   siguientes:
     *
          + Lunes a viernes son los días más fuertes para publicar

   El
     * lunes tiende a impulsar la mayor interacción de la semana
     * 3 p.m. cada día es el horario menos aconsejable para publicar
     * Es seguro publicar casi en cualquier horario (salvo 3 p.m.) de
       lunes a jueves
     * Los horarios de publicación más recomendados son los siguientes 2
       a.m., 8.a.m. y 5 p.m.

3 cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en Instagram

   La información proporcionada por eMarketer prevé que para fines de 2017
   más del 70% de las marcas de EE. UU. estará en Instagram. Esto
   significa que se esperan que más empresas estén en Instagram en vez de
   Twitter (67.2%), que será la primera vez para la red visual.

   Si bien las marcas están pasando rápidamente a Instagram, es importante
   saber qué tipo de contenido publicar primero. Aquí te presentamos tres
   consejos imprescindibles antes de comenzar a publicar en Instagram:
   instagram color themes gif

   1. Los temas y esquemas de colores funcionan
   Si observas algunas de las cuentas en Instagram más atractivas
   visualmente y más brillantes, encontrarás algo en común. Las marcas que
   se destacan en Instagram tienen un esquema de colores consistentes
   cuando ves su perfil. Las grandes marcas harán que todas las imágenes y
   videos parezcan que coincidan perfectamente al usar temas y colores
   específicos. Intenta que tu marca sea visualmente coherente en
   Instagram.
   instagram emojis gif

   2. Usar hashtags y emojis
   ¿Sabías estas Estadísticas de Instagram: 7 de 10 hashtags en la red
   incluyen la marca y más de la mitad del texto contiene un emoji? Esto
   quiere decir que es clave que puedas hacer branding de ti para lograr
   difusión, lealtad y alcance. Al mismo tiempo, la cantidad de emojis
   muestra que esto es una red donde puedes ser más personal y se puede
   conectar con los usuarios a través de emojis.
   instagram featured products gif

   3. Destacar tus productos
   Tal como lo mencionamos anteriormente, nunca intentes promocionar en
   exceso tus productos, sino debes centrarte en la interacción. Intenta
   la popular regla 80/20 que establece que el 80% del contenido debe ser
   educacional y atractivo mientras que el 20% debe ser autopromocional.
   Esto te permitirá mantener la atención de tu audiencia por más tiempo y
   convertirte en una fuente de información en Instagram.

El mejor horario para publicar en LinkedIn

   best time to post on linkedin graph

   Reconocida como la “red social de los profesionales”, hay más de 3
   millones de empresas que cuentan con páginas de empresa en LinkedIn en
   la red. En total, hay aproximadamente 238 millones de usuarios y se
   espera que ese número solamente crezca.

   El contenido con marca tiene la posibilidad de prosperar en LinkedIn y
   alcanzar audiencias clave en el proceso. Promocionar contenido en el
   momento justo puede marcar toda la diferencia, especialmente para
   marcas B2B. Aquí compartimos nuestros hallazgos sobre los mejores
   horarios de publicación en LinkedIn:
     * Martes a jueves son los días más recomendados para publicar
     * Al mediodía y a las 5 p.m. de martes a jueves son los mejores
       horarios para publicar
     * El horario menos recomendado es todos los días de 7 p.m. a 6 a.m.
     * Los días de publicación menos recomendados son sábado y domingo
     * Es seguro publicar de 8 a.m. a 5 p.m. durante los días hábiles

3 cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en LinkedIn

   LinkedIn se basa en contenido donde se pueda hacer clic. La red social
   funciona bien como un conductor hacia el embudo de marketing, pero hay
   algunos aspectos a tener en cuenta antes de comenzar. Aquí se mencionan
   tres cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en LinkedIn:
   linkedin boss gif

   1. Conocer tu nivel de antiguedad objetivo
   Independientemente de si es un puesto básico, un gerente o un director,
   es fundamental conocer la demografía y los puestos de trabajo objetivo
   de LinkedIn. Con la Analítica de LinkedIn , puedes descifrar los
   niveles de seniority y las posiciones de la industria de todos tus
   seguidores. Esto te permitirá saber a quién dirigir tu contenido.
   linkedin share events gif

   2. Compartir eventos de la empresa y de la industria
   Con la capacidad de LinkedIn de conectar profesionales, usa esta
   oportunidad para destacar los eventos de tu empresa o promocionar
   causas que respaldes. Además, la actualización de contenido sobre los
   eventos de la industria pueden ayudar a captar la atención de los
   usuarios principales de tu campo.
   [LI_EmployeesShare_Scaled.gif]

   3. Invitar a los empleados a compartir
   LinkedIn es un gran lugar para que tus empleados compartan el contenido
   de tu empresa. Con la ayuda del programa de asistencia como Bambu de
   Sprout Social, no tendrás que preocuparte por colocar a tus empleados
   en el asiento del conductor para publicar el contenido de la empresa.
   Conserva y administra noticias, actualizaciones de la empresa y abre
   posiciones con Bambu.

El mejor horario para publicar en Pinterest

   best time to post on pinterest graph

   Pinterest es una de las plataformas de redes sociales más exclusivas
   debido a su contenido y alcance. Esta red tiene más de 100 millones de
   pinners activos y las tendencias en contenido tienen una duración
   superior a otros resultados de redes sociales.

   Si bien el contenido generalmente dura más tiempo en los feeds de los
   usuarios, debemos conocer cuál es el mejor horario para publicar en
   Pinterest para alcanzar una audiencia inicial mayor. Conectarse de
   forma temprana en Pinterest es importante porque más usuarios volverán
   después de ver tu feed y considerarlo ilustrativo.

   De todas las redes sociales principales que se mencionaron, el horario
   recomendado para publicar en Pinterest es el más extraño. Se encontró
   poca información sobre sugerencias para publicar durante el horario
   laboral normal. Aquí te contamos en detalle los mejores horarios para
   publicar en Pinterest:
     * Sábado es el día más recomendado para publicar
     * Viernes a domingo son los días más recomendados para publicar
     * Tarde a la noche hasta las 3 a.m. (salvo la medianoche a 1 a.m.) es
       un horario seguro para publicar
     * Sábado a las 2 p.m. y 9 p.m. son los mejores horarios para publicar
     * El horario menos recomendado para publicar es de domingo a viernes
       de 4 a.m. a 7 p.m.

3 cosas que debes saber antes de publicar en Pinterest

   Para ser exitoso en Pinterest, debes esforzarte por hacer crecer tu
   audiencia y ser más visible. Si tu contenido se configura correctamente
   y se publica en un horario óptimo, tienes mejores posibilidades de
   ampliar tu alcance. Aquí te contamos tres cosas que debes saber antes
   de publicar en Pinterest.
   pinterest focus on demographics gif

   1. Centrarse en la audiencia principal
   Las marcas que usan Pinterest tienen una gran oportunidad de ser más
   específicos con su contenido. Pinterest te permite escribir
   descripciones que se pueden buscar para ayudarte a acotar las
   intenciones de búsquedas de los usuarios. Por ejemplo, puedes agregar
   descripciones como “La mejor pava inalámbrica y más accesible que se
   ofrece en negro”. Al hacerlo, serás ultra específico con tu contenido.
   pinterest timely posting gif

   2. Dedicar tiempo a las descripciones de los pines
   Las descripciones de pines no deberían contener solo palabras clave. En
   cambio, usa este espacio para ser específico, detallar las imágenes y
   nombrar a la persona que haya tomado la foto o armado el objeto. Esto
   permitirá a los usuarios de Pinterest interactuar con tu contenido de
   manera más libre.
   pinterest engagement gif

   3. Propiciar la interacción
   Al igual que cualquier otra red, Pinterest es ideal para interactuar
   con otros usuarios. Crea tableros de contenido generados por el usuario
   para tus seguidores leales y así entablar una buena relación. Cuando
   los usuarios interactúan, regresan y comparten tu contenido.

Cómo recolectamos la información

   Después de leer muchos artículos sobre el mejor horario para publicar
   en las redes sociales, descubrimos que hay muchos puntos de datos y
   argumentos en conflicto. Por ejemplo, algunos datos se mostraban por
   región mientras que otros destacaban a una industria específica. Cada
   conjunto de datos se basa en diferentes resultados y en diferentes
   tamaños de audiencia.
   data sources graphic

   Queríamos comprobar que no había un minuto específico de la hora para
   alcanzar la mayor audiencia o para lograr la mayor interacción. Los
   datos son tan intercambiables para cada industria o negocio que es más
   simple poder conocer los rangos de fechas y hora en el tablero.

   Por este motivo, elegimos un mapa de calor de todos los datos que
   encontramos en vez de un solo informe. Nuestro objetivo fue medir la
   temperatura del agua por usted al usar puntos de datos más críticos de
   todas las fuentes (y tratar de evitar que los datos se superpongan).

   Una vez que se recolectó la información, presentamos todo en base a un
   “nivel de interés” para cada horario y día. A medida que crecía la
   cantidad de recomendaciones para un determinado día o período de
   tiempo, aumentaba el índice de calor. En vez de datos específicos,
   ofrecemos rangos recomendados para realizar las publicaciones.

Facilitar la programación con ViralPost

   Conocer el mejor horario para publicar en las redes sociales puede ser
   muy útil, pero no debería consumir tiempo de tu día. Si bien muchas
   herramientas de gestión de redes sociales cuentan con capacidades de
   programación, ViralPost de Sprout Social te lleva al próximo nivel.

   publishing sprout queue

   mejor horario para conectarte con tu audiencia. Sigue estos consejos y

Avaliando os melhores horários para publicar nas redes sociais

   Photo of the author, Alex York by Alex York

   Gerenciar todas as suas redes sociais pode ser uma tarefa assustadora.
   Saber os melhores horários para publicar nas redes sociais é ainda mais
   desafiador. Basta perguntar a qualquer gerente de rede social
   experiente quão difícil é estar no topo de cada rede.

   Gerenciar essas comunidades exige conhecimento e muito palpite. Ao
   gerenciar várias contas fica difícil saber quais são os melhores
   horários para publicar nas redes sociais.

Por que você deve ter conhecimento dos melhores horários para postar nas
redes sociais

   Saber os melhores horários para publicar nas redes sociais pode fazer a
   diferença entre um clique ou 10. Pesque sempre onde há peixe fisgando o
   anzol.

   Embora seja fácil adivinhar ou escolher um horário específico, é mais
   eficaz descobrir intervalos de tempo em vez de momentos exatos. Apostar
   em um tempo exato pode ser um desperdício de tempo já que o
   público-alvo de cada empresa varia. Mas conhecer todos os possíveis
   horários do dia pode simplificar essa parte de publicações.

   Vamos conferir cada rede relevante e ver o que descobrimos sobre os
   melhores horários para publicar nas redes sociais:
     * Ir para o Facebook
     * Ir para o Twitter
     * Ir para o Instagram
     * Ir para o LinkedIn
     * Ir para o Pinterest
     * Como reunimos os dados

O melhor horário para publicar no Facebook

   best time to post on facebook graph

   Com quase 1,18 bilhão de usuários ativos por mês, o Facebook reina
   entre as redes sociais. No entanto, com o algoritmo do Facebook, que
   não para de mudar, é difícil obter posts orgânicos diante dos olhos de
   todo o seu público.

   Dessa forma, as marcas precisam ser mais estratégicas com relação à
   hora do dia em que postam no Facebook. Por meio de diferentes fontes de
   dados, o Facebook certamente é um ponto ativo todos os dias da semana.
   Enquanto outras redes de rede social certamente têm menos dias ativos
   durante toda a semana, é meio difícil errar na hora de encontrar um
   horário para postar no Facebook.

   No entanto, há alguns poucos horários, padrões e dias da semana
   notáveis que poderiam predominar. Seguem algumas das descobertas:
     * Quinta-feira é o dia mais recomendado para postar
     * 13h da quinta-feira horário de maior atividade
     * Relativamente seguro postar qualquer dia entre 9h e 15h
     * De manhãzinha e no fim da noite são os horários menos ideais para
       postar
     * Entre quarta-feira e domingo são os melhores dias para postar

3 coisas a saber antes de publicar no Facebook

   O Facebook é único no mundo do marketing por causa de seu tamanho e por
   conta da dificuldade que é se engajar. Por isso é inteligente saber com
   antecedência o que você vai postar. Seguem três coisas que você deve
   saber:
   facebook video gif

   1. Usar vídeos
   Os vídeos continuam dominando a audiência do Facebook. Na verdade, um
   estudo da Socialbakers descobrir que os vídeos postados no Facebook têm
   um alcance orgânico de 8,71% em comparação aos 5,77% dos posts de
   fotos. Além disso, dados da Digiday apontaram que 85% dos vídeos de
   algumas marcas no Facebook são reproduzidos sem som algum. Isso
   significa que você precisa postar vídeos altamente envolventes que não
   necessariamente dependem de áudio. Mas não esqueça das legendas, uma
   vez que o texto poderia manter os usuários envolvidos, sem a
   necessidade de som.
   facebook know what works gif

   2. Saiba o que deu certo no passado
   Não complique as coisas postando conteúdo aleatório no Facebook. Pelo
   contrário, monitore seu alcance total, curtidas, comentários e
   engajamentos com as ferramentas de gestão do Facebook oferecidas pelo
   Sprout Social. Facilmente detalhe as peças de conteúdo a trabalhar e
   use isso em seu favor.
   short and sweet gif

   3. Faça posts curtos e agradáveis
   O Facebook permite escrever posts gigantescos, mas será que seus
   seguidores realmente querem ler tudo isso? Em vez disso, o BuzzSumo
   recomenda posts que se limitam a 50 caracteres. A rede não é um lugar
   em que os usuários passarão um tempão lendo cada post; isso significa
   que engajamentos rápidos funcionam melhor.

Melhor horário para publicar no Twitter

   best time to post on twitter graph

   O Twitter ainda é uma das maneiras mais rápidas de se comunicar com os
   clientes via rede social. Na verdade, o Índice do 2º trim. de 2016 do
   Sprout descobriu que 34,5% dos clientes preferem as redes sociais como
   ponto de contato (método mais bem avaliado).

   Também é muito importante conhecer os melhores horários para tuitar
   para otimizar o potencial máximo de público por dia. Para obter uma
   melhor visão na rede, apresentamos alguns fatos interessantes sobre os
   melhores horários para postar no Twitter:
     * De segunda a quinta-feira são os melhores dias para postar
     * Quinta-feira é o dia da semana mais recomendado para postar
     * Meio-dia da quinta-feira é o horário de maior atividade na semana
     * Seguro para postar qualquer dia da semana entre 12h e 15h
     * De manhãzinha e no fim da noite são os horários menos ideais para
       postar

3 coisas a saber antes de publicar no Twitter

   Como mencionamos antes, o Twitter é complicado e se move a um ritmo
   frenético. Você quer se dar bem com sua agenda de publicações, mas tão
   importante quanto isso é saber o que você está publicando. É
   inteligente pensar em “qualidade e não quantidade” no que se refere a
   seus hábitos de publicação nas redes sociais e essa ideia vale dez
   vezes quando se trata de postar no Twitter. Antes de começar, seguem
   três coisas que você deve saber:
   twitter follow industry leaders gif

   1. Siga todos os seus líderes da indústria
   Não importa se o seu ramo é um nicho como assistência técnica de
   câmeras ou sólido como atendimento de saúde, você precisa seguir todos
   os profissionais do seu setor. Agindo assim, você fará o nome da sua
   marca e aumentará as chances de envolvimento com líderes inovadores da
   sua indústria quando você postar. Além disso, se você seguir esses
   melhores horários para postar no Twitter, o mais provável é que você
   bata o número de visualizações ideais dos seus líderes, o que estaria
   ainda mais significativamente ao seu alcance.

   2. Esteja pronto para se engajar
   Saber quais são os melhores horários para postar no Twitter é
   fundamental, mas tão importante quanto é estar pronto para se engajar
   quando você tuíta. Segundo o Índice do 3º trim. do Sprout, 57% dos
   usuários se irritam quando as marcas se promovem muito nas redes
   sociais. Para o Twitter tente limitar seu conteúdo promocional e esteja
   pronto para se engajar com os usuários. Se fizer tudo corretamente,
   desenvolverá relacionamentos melhores e aumentará a confiança na sua
   marca.
   twitter clicks are critical gif

   3. Cliques são fundamentais
   Segundo dados da Shareaholic, o Twitter foi considerado omenos eficaz
   em gerar cliques quando comparado a outras redes sociais. Por ser muito
   difícil obter cliques no Twitter, em primeiro lugar, você tem que
   garantir que o seu conteúdo é absolutamente clicável e envolvente. Use
   as ferramentas de analítica do Twitter para monitorar cliques em posts
   e, assim, saber qual conteúdo gera mais engajamento e qual não
   funciona.

Melhor horário para publicar no Instagram

   best time to post on instagram graph

   As marcas descobriram rapidamente o poder do Instagram em termos de
   aumento do engajamento nas redes sociais, tornando-o uma das redes mais
   populares. Na verdade, dados da Forrester apontaram que o Instagram tem
   a maior taxa de interação por seguidor (2,2%) em comparação a qualquer
   outra rede social (segundo maior com o Facebook a 0,22%).

   Com o imenso potencial de engajamento, um recém-implementado algoritmo
   do Instagram e mais usuários chegando diariamente, saber quais são os
   melhores horários para postar no Instagram faria toda a diferença na
   sua estratégia de marketing. Algumas das coisas mais importantes que
   aprendemos:
     * De segunda a sexta-feira são os melhores dias para postar
     * Segunda-feira tende a gerar o maior volume de engajamento da semana
     * Todo dia às 15h é o horário menos ideal para postar
     * É seguro postar praticamente em qualquer horário (menos às 15h) na
       Segunda a quinta-feira
     * Os horários mais recomendados para postar são>2h, 8h e 17h.

3 coisas a saber antes de publicar no Instagram

   Dados da eMarketer apontam que no final de 2017, mais de 70% das marcas
   norte-americanas estarão no Instagram. Isso significa que mais empresas
   estarão presentes no Instagram do que no Twitter (67,2%) – seria a
   primeira vez da rede visual.

   Embora as marcas estejam migrando rapidamente para Instagram, em
   primeiro lugar é importante saber que tipo de conteúdo postar. Seguem
   três dicas imprescindíveis a seguir antes de começar a postar no
   Instagram:
   instagram color themes gif

   1. Temas de cores e esquemas de trabalho
   Se você olhar para algumas das contas de maior destaque e visualmente
   atraentes do Instagram, perceberá um tema comum. As marcas que se dão
   bem no Instagram normalmente têm um esquema de cores consistentes ao
   visualizar seu perfil. Usando temas e cores específicas, as grandes
   marcas farão com que todas as suas imagens e vídeos parecem se fundir
   perfeitamente. Tente fazer com que sua marca seja visualmente coesa no
   Instagram.
   instagram emojis gif

   2. Use hashtags e emojis
   Você conhecia essas estatísticas do Instagram: 7 entre 10 hashtags na
   rede são de marcas e mais da metade do texto contém um emoji? Isso
   significa que fazer branding de si mesmo é essencial para notoriedade,
   fidelização e alcance. Ao mesmo tempo, a quantidade de emojis mostra
   que esta é uma rede em que você pode ser mais pessoal e se conectar com
   os usuários por meio de emoticons.

   3. Apresente seus produtos com moderação
   Como já mencionamos, não é legal ficar promovendo excessivamente seu
   produto; em vez disso, concentre-se no engajamento. Experimente a
   popular regra 80/20, que estabelece que 80% do conteúdo deve ser
   educativo e envolvente, enquanto 20% deve ser autopromocional. Isso lhe
   ajudará a prender a atenção do seu público por mais tempo e lhe tornará
   uma fonte de informações no Instagram.

Melhor horário para publicar no LinkedIn

   best time to post on linkedin graph

   Conhecida como a “rede social do profissional”, há mais de 3 milhões de
   empresas com páginas corporativas no LinkedIn. No geral, há cerca de
   238 milhões de usuários e esse número só vai crescer.

   Conteúdo da marca tem a chance de prosperar no LinkedIn e atingir
   públicos-chave no processo. Promover conteúdo na hora certa pode fazer
   toda a diferença, especialmente para as marcas B2B. Eis as nossas
   conclusões sobre os melhores horários para postar no LinkedIn:
     * De terça a quinta-feira são os dias mais recomendados para postar
     * 12h e 17h, de terça a quinta-feira são os horários mais ideais para
       postar
     * Os horários menos ideais para postar são todos os dias das 19h às
       6h
     * Os horários menos ideais para postar são sábados e domingos
     * É seguro postar das 8h às 17h em dias da semana

3 coisas a saber antes de publicar no LinkedIn

   O LinkedIn se resume a conteúdo que deve ser clicado. A rede social
   funciona bem como um motorista que passa por um funil de marketing, mas
   há algumas coisas a observar antes de começar. Seguem três coisas que
   você deve saber antes de postar no LinkedIn:
   linkedin boss gif

   1. Conheça o nível de senioridade do seu alvo
   Não importa se é um cargo de nível iniciante, gerente ou diretor, é
   importante saber a demografia-alvo do LinkedIn e vagas de trabalho. Com
   a analítica do LinkedIn Sprout Social, você pode decifrar os níveis de
   senioridade e as posições do setor de todos os seus seguidores. Isso
   lhe dará insights sobre quem abordar com o seu conteúdo.
   linkedin share events gif

   2. Compartilhe eventos do setor e da empresa
   Com a capacidade do LinkedIn de conectar profissionais, utilize esta
   oportunidade para destacar os eventos de sua empresa ou para promover
   causas que você apoia. Além disso, a atualização do conteúdo em torno
   de eventos do setor poderia ajudá-lo a obter a atenção de usuários
   importantes do seu campo.
   [LI_EmployeesShare_Scaled.gif]

   3. Incentive os colaboradores a compartilhar
   O LinkedIn é um ótimo local para os seus funcionários compartilharem
   conteúdo de sua empresa. Com a ajuda de um programa de defesa como o
   Bambu by Sprout social, você elimina a preocupação de colocar seus
   funcionários à frente da responsabilidade de postar conteúdo da
   empresa. Filtre e gerencie notícias, atualizações da empresa e vagas em
   aberto com Bambu.

Melhor horário para publicar no Pinterest

   best time to post on pinterest graph

   Pinterest é uma das plataformas de rede social mais originais por causa
   de seu conteúdo e acessibilidade. A rede tem mais de 100 milhões de
   pinners ativos e o conteúdo tende a ter uma vida útil muito mais longa
   em comparação a outras redes sociais.

   Mesmo que o conteúdo normalmente dure mais tempo nos feeds dos
   usuários, vale a pena conhecer os melhores horários para postar no
   Pinterest a fim de atingir um público inicial maior. Conectar-se mais
   cedo no Pinterest é importante porque mais usuários vão voltar depois
   de ver o seu feed e considerá-lo informativo.

   De todas as principais redes sociais listadas, o Pinterest teve as mais
   estranhas sugestões de horários. Havia poucos dados sugerindo para
   postar durante o horário comercial. Segue um olhar mais aprofundado
   sobre os melhores momentos para postar no Pinterest:
     * Sábado é o dia mais recomendado para postar
     * Entre sexta-feira e domingo são os melhores dias para postar
     * Fim de noite até 3h (menos entre meia-noite e 1 da manhã) são
       horários seguros para postar
     * 14h e 21h aos sábados é a faixa de horário mais ideal para postar
     * Os horários menos ideais para postar são domingos a sextas-feiras,
       das 4h às 19h

3 coisas a saber antes de publicar no Pinterest

   Para ter sucesso no Pinterest, você tem que se esforçar em aumentar seu
   público e obter mais exposição. Se o seu conteúdo estiver configurado
   corretamente e for postado em um horário ideal, você tem uma chance
   muito maior de ampliar seu alcance. Seguem três coisas que você deve
   saber antes de postar no Pinterest:
   pinterest focus on demographics gif

   1. Concentre-se no seu público central
   As marcas que usam o Pinterest têm uma ótima opção para serem mais
   específicas com o seu conteúdo. O Pinterest permite escrever descrições
   pesquisáveis para ajudá-lo a diminuir as intenções de busca dos
   usuários. Por exemplo, você pode adicionar descrições como “As melhores
   e mais acessíveis chaleiras sem fio que vêm em preto.” Agindo assim
   você se torna ultraespecífico com seu conteúdo.
   pinterest timely posting gif

   2. Coloque horário nas suas descrições pin
   As descrições pin não devem conter palavras-chave. Em vez disso, use
   esse espaço para ser específico, detalhe seu visual e nome de quem
   tirou a foto ou fez o objeto. Isso ajudará os usuários do Pinterest a
   se envolver com o seu conteúdo de forma mais livre.
   pinterest engagement gif

   3. Espaço para engajamento
   Assim como qualquer outra rede, o Pinterest é excelente para engajar-se
   com outros usuários. Crie painéis de conteúdo gerados pelo usuário para
   trabalhar o relacionamento com seus seguidores fiéis. Quando os
   usuários se engajam, eles voltam e compartilham seu conteúdo.

Como reunir os dados

   Depois de ler tantos artigos sobre os melhores horários para postar nas
   redes sociais, descobrimos que havia muitos pontos de dados e questões
   conflitantes. Por exemplo, alguns dados eram mostrados por região,
   enquanto outros destacavam uma indústria específica. Cada conjunto de
   dados foi baseado em diferentes descobertas e de vários tamanhos de
   público-alvo.
   data sources graphic

   Queríamos provar que não existe o minuto certeiro para alcançar o maior
   público ou para obter o máximo engajamento. Os dados são tão
   intercambiáveis para cada indústria ou empresa que é muito mais simples
   saber os intervalos de hora e data.

   É por isso que escolhemos um mapa de calor de todos os dados que
   encontramos e o comparamos em um único relatório. Nosso objetivo era
   medir a temperatura da água para você, usando os pontos de dados mais
   críticos de todas as fontes (e tentamos impedir que os dados se
   sobrepusessem).

   Uma vez que a informação foi acumulada, apresentamos tudo em uma base
   de “nível de interesse” para cada hora e dia. À medida que mais
   recomendações provenientes dos dados cresciam a um determinado dia ou
   período de tempo, aumentamos o índice de calor. Em vez de detalhes,
   você tem intervalos para quando enviar mensagens.

Facilitando o agendamento com post viral

   Saber os melhores horários para postar nas redes sociais é realmente
   útil, mas não deve tomar seu tempo. Enquanto muitas ferramentas de
   gestão de mídia contam com recursos de agendamento, o Viral Post do
   Sprout Social leve isso a um nível acima.

   publishing sprout queue

   redes sociais a encontrar o melhor horário para postar em cada
   plataforma. Com esse recurso, você pode facilmente definir o conteúdo
   que será publicado e o Viral Post escolherá um horário em que a maioria

   público na hora certa novamente. Faça das redes sociais algo fácil para

Best times to post on social media for 2019

   Photo of the author, Elizabeth Arens by Elizabeth Arens

   Social media is always evolving, and users’ behavior changes with it.
   One fact that doesn’t change is that all social platforms move fast,
   with a constant stream of content vying for attention. You want to get
   the most eyes possible on your content and maximize engagement by
   knowing the best times to post on social networks.

   It’s not enough to guess when users might log in to a given network, or
   when audiences in your niche are hungriest for the latest information.
   Now that more and more brands from all kinds of industries realize the
   value of connecting with their audiences on social networks, it’s
   important to understand how your audience uses social platforms and
   what they want out of your content. An ecommerce brand may see social
   engagement follow daily and seasonal patterns of shopping engagement,
   while a corporate thought leadership account may see plenty of clicks
   at the start of the workday when readers are looking for inspiration.

   In order to get granular and find out the best times to publish on
   social media for four social media networks, we worked closely with
   Sprout’s data science team to pull this information based on our
   customers. The data below shows when our 25,000-plus Sprout customers
   were engaged the most (and least) across major networks and broken down
   by industry.

   Let’s take a look at the unique insights we found for the best times to
   post on each social network:
     * Best times to post on Facebook
     * Best times to post on Instagram
     * Best times to post on Twitter
     * Best times to post on LinkedIn
     * How we gathered this data

   Disclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan
   types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded in
   Central Time Zone (CST). Number of engagements represents total
   engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour
   time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level
   engagement times.

Best times to post on Facebook

   Facebook global engagement

   Facebook has over two billion active users, making it the most
   populated platform by far. This huge audience means there’s a major
   opportunity for organic engagement on Facebook, if you keep in mind the
   current Facebook algorithm. The changes in the algorithm in the last
   couple of years have emphasized friends, family and meaningful
   connection, so content that drives genuine engagement is your best bet.

   In addition to a content strategy that connects meaningfully with your
   audience, you’ll best meet this need for engagement by posting at the
   times when users are most active on the network.

   Here are the key data points we found for the best times to post on
   Facebook:
     * Best times to post to Facebook: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the best day to post on Facebook.
     * Most consistent engagement: Weekdays from 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday has the least amount of engagement for Facebook
       during the week.
     * Lowest engagement: Early mornings and evenings, before 7 a.m. and
       after 5 p.m. have the least amount of engagement per day.

What we learned

   As you’ll see with other social networks, mid-week is the peak period
   on Facebook. The middle of each weekday, from morning to mid-afternoon,
   are safe times to post, meaning engagement remains consistent
   throughout these blocks of time.

   While people frequently check in throughout the middle of the day to
   see what’s going on, the peak times are around lunch breaks. When
   people have more time to scroll through their Facebook feeds and dig
   into interesting posts, engagement rises correspondingly.

   On the other hand, late night and early evening along with weekend days
   bring in relatively low engagement. While people may check in or post a
   few updates from weekend activities in the middle of the day on
   Saturday, these times aren’t your best bet for reaching audiences.

Best times to post on Facebook for consumer goods

   Facebook consumer goods engagement

   Whether you’re promoting an online shopping experience or driving
   audiences to brick-and-mortar retail, Facebook plays a key part in your
   social strategy. In addition to your niche’s unique customer personas,

   Disclaimer: Industry specific heat maps are more concentrated to show
   medium- and high-level engagement.
     * The best times for consumer goods brands to post to Facebook:

       10–11 a.m. and Thursday at 5 p.m.

       engagement times for schools are every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for nonprofit

   Facebook is a great place to highlight a nonprofit’s mission with
   longer form posts and discussions, as well as drawing attention to
   upcoming events. We found that nonprofits on Facebook frequently see
   the most engagement during weekday mornings.
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Facebook: Wednesday at 8–9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times: Thursday at 10 a.m. and Friday 8-10
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday show the least engagement
       per day, and with the worst times being 10 p.m.–5 a.m. every day.

   Even with challenges in gaining organic engagement, Facebook is still
   an essential part of tech companies’ social strategy. Whether you’re

       well.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday 8 a.m.–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 6 p.m–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Facebook for healthcare

   Facebook healthcare engagement

   Social audiences increasingly expect healthcare practices to have a
   social presence. Facebook is a great place to highlight your local
   practice and provide essential info to current and prospective
   patients. The best times to post for healthcare to reach these
   audiences include:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Facebook:
       Wednesday at 9–10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m.–3 or
       4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Avoid Saturday and Sunday, which have minimal
       engagement, and every day from 9 p.m.–4 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram

   Instagram global engagement

   Having recently grown to one billion monthly active users, and a median
   1.60% engagement rate per post, Instagram is definitely on the rise in
   the social space. The network has also debuted a number of new features
   recently, expanding the options for how users can interact with posts
   on this visual-first platform.

   Similar to Facebook’s 2018 focus on a more authentic and
   personal-feeling social experience, the Instagram algorithm in 2019
   prioritizes certain posts algorithmically in a user’s feed, marking a
   change from the previous reverse chronological order. In addition to
   the main feed, Stories has grown significantly since its 2016 launch,
   and 2018 also brought the debut of Instagram TV. Taken together, all of
   these options let brands create engaging video content of both
   micro-length and long-form templates.

   With all of these ways to reach an audience, plus Instagram’s notable
   focus on retail, you’ll want to know these key stats for the best times
   for brands to post on Instagram:
     * Best times to post on Instagram: Wednesday at 11 a.m. and Friday at
       10–11 a.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday is the overall best day to post to Instagram
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m–3 p.m.
     * Worst day: Sunday receives the least amount of engagement on
       Instagram
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs during late night and early morning from
       11 p.m.–3 a.m.

What we learned

   While Instagram engagement peaks mid-day and mid-week, similar to the
   other major social networks, there are a few opportune windows found in
   the evening and morning during the middle of the week. While the safest
   times to post are still during those core weekday times, it could be
   well worth it for certain brand niches to consider if your audiences
   are among those reaching for the ‘Gram first thing in the morning or
   last thing before sleeping.

   While there is a bit of increased engagement around midday on Saturday,
   weekends aren’t your best bet for getting eyes on your posts.
   Similarly, even those late night users eventually pack it in, with
   engagement dropping in the latest hours of the night and earliest hours
   of the morning

Best times to post on Instagram for consumer goods

   instagram consumer goods engagement

   Over the past year, Instagram has cemented its role as a top network
   for shopping. This means that any retail or shopping business can’t
   afford to ignore the platform. Improve your chances of cutting through
   the noise in this busy space by keeping in mind the top times to post
   on Instagram for consumer goods and retail:
     * The best time for consumer brands to post on Instagram: Wednesday
       at 3 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
     * Another higher engagement time period occurs on Saturday around 10
       a.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday has the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m–3 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for media

   instagram media engagement

   As Instagram expands its video offerings, it’s becoming a unique
   channel for media companies to highlight their best visual content. Our
   findings show that Instagram’s audience taps in a bit earlier in the
   day for media content than other industries, so consider these times to
   post when planning to highlight your best content:
     * The best time for media companies to post on Instagram: Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m–4
       p.m.
     * There’s also a period of higher engagement that lasts all the way
       through Thursday night into Friday morning. It’s lower than the
       highest peak times, but it could be a unique time to capture
       audiences that aren’t active in other industries’ niches.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday have the least engagement
       for media companies on Instagram.

Best times to post on Instagram for education

   instagram education engagement

   For colleges and schools, Instagram is a great opportunity to build
   your visual identity and highlight on-campus experiences. Engagement
   patterns trend a bit later in the day for education as the
   student-heavy audience starts getting on their phones in the later
   afternoon. Here are the best times to post for educational institutions
   on Instagram:
     * The best time to post on Instagram for schools: Friday at 10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday through Saturday at 10 a.m.–8
       p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday at 11 a.m., Friday
       from 11 a.m.–12 p.m. and 2 p.m., and Saturday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and every day from 11 p.m–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for nonprofit

   instagram nonprofit engagement

   Instagram is the perfect complement to the rest of your nonprofit’s
   social strategy. If you’ve promoted an event ahead of time on Facebook,
   follow up on Instagram to show off photos from the event and start
   building your brand’s visual identity. Keep in mind these peak times to
   post for nonprofits:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post to Instagram: Wednesday at 2
       p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Monday from 2–3 p.m., Tuesday
       from 1–3 p.m. and a relatively strong block of time on Saturday
       from 1–2 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday gets the least engagement, as well as
       every day from 11 p.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Instagram for tech

   instagram tech engagement

   Trends for the tech industry vary somewhat from the global peak times
   on Instagram, with audiences tuning into their feeds for bursts of
   activity earlier in the day. Take these peak times into account for
   your content planning as you highlight your products, services and
   company culture on Instagram:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Instagram: Wednesday at
       6 a.m. and 9 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Wednesday from 10–11 a.m., Friday from
       7–10 a.m., and Saturday from 7–11 a.m.
     * There’s also fairly high opportunity for engagement on Tuesday at
       10 p.m., and both Wednesday and Friday mornings show more
       engagement than other industries at these early hours.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday had the least engagement overall for tech
       companies.

Best times to post on Instagram for healthcare

   instagram healthcare engagement

   It’s clear from our findings that Instagram still isn’t a priority for
   many healthcare practices. However, considering the high engagement it
   drives for many other industries, it’s clear that audiences, including
   prospective patients, are on the platform. It’s well worth it to expand
   your reach by planning around these times to post:
     * The best time for healthcare practices to post on Instagram:
       Tuesday at 8 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday from 7 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Evening and overnight every day from 6 p.m.–6
       a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter

   Twitter global engagement

   Twitter presents a huge opportunity for brands to connect directly with
   audiences and manage customer care.

   This means timeliness is key on Twitter. While the social network
   selectively highlights some activity out of chronological sequence
   based on user interests, most people are still scrolling through to
   catch up on the latest posts and musings from their group of followed
   accounts. Posting at off-peak hours could and cause you to miss out on
   a lot of your potential engagement.

   With 500 million tweets sent per day, Twitter provides a goldmine of
   social opinions and conversation that can inform your brand strategy.
   In addition to using Twitter listening to know what topics offer the
   most opportunity to engage, you’ll want to keep in mind these stats for
   when to post on Twitter:
     * Best times to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and Friday at 9
       a.m.
     * Best days: Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days to post on
       Twitter.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–4
       p.m.
     * Worst day: Saturday gets the least engagement.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs every day from 10 p.m–4 a.m.

What we learned

   Twitter heats up a bit earlier in the morning, probably as audiences
   are starting to go about their day and take a moment to catch up on and
   digest the biggest news and updates from their areas of interest. The
   peak times of engagement also carry into the lunch hour, and begin to
   taper slightly through the late afternoon and evening, finally dropping
   off as late night approaches.

   Like other social networks, mid-week on Tuesday and Wednesday are your
   top days to post on Twitter, and engagement drops off on weekends. We
   do still see that morning check-in occurring around 9 on both Saturday
   and Sunday, just to a lesser extent.

Best times to post on Twitter for consumer goods

   twitter consumer goods engagement

   Twitter is an essential customer care channel for retailers and
   ecommerce businesses. Compared to Facebook and Instagram engagement,
   activity actually builds during the weekend rather than falling off.
   This could indicate that users are online for answers and help about
   products they’ve been putting off during the week, or seeking info to
   complement a shopping trip or outing. Either way, quick response times
   are essential when people take time on days off to reach out to your
   brand, so be ready for these peak times:
     * The best time for consumer goods brands to post to Twitter: Sunday
       at 11 a.m.
     * Other peak engagement times include Saturday at 3 p.m. and
       Wednesday at 1 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Sunday from 9 a.m.–3 p.m. or Monday
       through Wednesday from 12 p.m–3 p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Friday is the day with the lowest engagement,
       and the worst times for consumer goods each day are between 10
       p.m–6 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for media

   twitter media engagement

   Twitter has become a go-to platform for journalists, authors and
   experts to share ideas and opinions—often around the clock. We saw this
   reflected in the hotspot of activity that lasts throughout the night
   from Thursday through Friday morning. There are still some other peak
   times you’ll want to know about if you’re looking to get your top
   stories and content in front of Twitter users:
     * The best times for media companies to post on Twitter: Thursday at
       9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Thursday from 4 p.m–8 p.m. and
       Friday from 7 a.m.–11 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: All day Saturday.

Best times to post on Twitter for education

   twitter education engagement

   Educational institutions can take a unique approach to Twitter by
   segmenting out different parts of their social stream with separate
   Twitter accounts for everything from sports teams to dining services.
   As with other social networks for education, the peak times are shifted
   a bit from the global top times, so adjust to the unique schedules of
   your students with these top times to post:
     * The best time for schools to post on Twitter: Saturday at 5 p.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Saturday from 1 p.m.–10 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Safe times to post during the week
       include Wednesday from 8 a.m.–12 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m.–12
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Sunday and early morning every day from 12
       a.m.–5 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for nonprofit

   twitter nonprofit engagement

   Nonprofits have a great opportunity to build up their community on
   Twitter and start conversations with the audiences most engaged with
   their causes. Keep in mind these key times to post for nonprofits on
   Twitter:
     * The best time for nonprofits to post on Twitter: Wednesday at 7
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include Wednesday from 6 a.m.–4 p.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday get the least engagement, as
       well as every day between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Best times to post on Twitter for tech

   twitter tech engagement

   It’s no surprise the tech industry is consistently active throughout
   the week on Twitter. Whether you have one or multiple accounts
   conducting customer service, promoting your brand or sharing thought
   leadership, consider using social listening or Twitter advanced search
   features to tap into the topics your audiences are discussing. Consider
   these top times for the tech industry to get active on Twitter:
     * The best time for tech companies to post on Twitter: Tuesday at 9
       a.m.
     * Other high engagement times include the rest of the morning on
       Tuesday from 7–10 a.m. and Wednesday from 8-10 a.m.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–1
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Saturday and Sunday are the days that get the
       least engagement, and it’s also lower from 6 p.m to 5 a.m. every
       day.

Best times to post on Twitter for healthcare

   twitter healthcare engagement

   As we’ve emphasized, Twitter is ideal for conversation and customer
   care. Health questions can be the most pressing of all, so whether it’s
   an account for a local practice or a major pharmaceutical brand, be
   ready for your audiences by being aware of the best times for
   healthcare accounts on Twitter:
     * The best times for healthcare practices and business to post on
       Twitter: Wednesday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
     * Other notably high engagement times include Monday at 2 p.m.,
       Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Friday at 8 a.m. There’s also
       additional engagement on Wednesday morning compared to other
       weekday mornings.
     * Most consistent engagement: Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.–3
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: The day with the least engagement is Sunday.

Best times to post on LinkedIn

   times to post for linkedin

   LinkedIn targets a more specific audience than other social networks,
   and as it continues to grow, we’ve gotten a fuller picture of the best
   times to post compared to our overview in 2018. In order to provide the
   greatest accuracy, we didn’t break down this data into individual
   industries.

   The network’s more niche audience is no reason to ignore its marketing
   power, however. These motivated users tend to generate more leads,
   especially for B2B marketing. Here’s our findings on the best times to
   post on LinkedIn:
     * The best times to post to LinkedIn: Wednesday at 9–10 a.m. and 12
       p.m.
     * Best day: Wednesday.
     * Most consistent engagement: Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m.–2
       p.m.
     * Lowest engagement: Occurs on Sunday and the least popular times to
       post are every day from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.

What we learned

   Considering LinkedIn’s corporate-minded mix of thought leaders, job
   seekers and company page curation, it’s no surprise that activity is
   much more concentrated around workdays. Activity ramps up on Tuesday as
   people get through the Monday rush, and tapers fairly uniformly after 3
   p.m. as the last tasks of the workday take priority.

   Weekends garner fairly low engagement, which is expected as people step
   away from their devices and desks on Saturday and Sunday.

   We understand that these type of reports can raise questions about just
   where the data is coming from. That’s why we want to be clear about the
   data we pulled and how we got here.

   First off, we were luckily enough to work with Sprout Social’s very own
   data science team to gather together this information from our
   customers. Joel Booth, a Senior Data Scientist at Sprout, explained how
   it all works.

   “Sprout integrates with the different social media platforms via their
   API, which allows the application to receive messages on behalf of our
   customers,” Booth said. “Essentially, this is how we power features
   such as Sprout’s Smart Inbox and Reports.”

Using ViralPost to publish at the best times

   Our data team is constantly collecting data. And this information isn’t
   just used to put together amazing reports like you’ve read above. In
   fact, Sprout Social’s very own ViralPost works off this data regularly
   for our customers.

   ViralPost hones in on the best times to post on social media

   Booth further explained that Sprout’s proprietary algorithm analyzes
   the publishing history of our customers and collects data on how and
   when their audiences engage. This is what makes ViralPost so unique—it
   allows users to find future times to post that work best for their
   channels.

   “ViralPost is an opportunity for the data science team to not only make
   our customers’ social efforts more effective, but also easier,” Booth
   said. “The algorithm can look at more messages, more engagements and
   more factors over a far wider range of time than a person in order to
   pinpoint those ideal times to send a message and how those times change
   week to week.”

   Simply put, having publishing times is extremely handy, but why not use
   a tool that can publish during the suggested times? ViralPost works
   with actual customer data, just like what we’ve pulled to assemble this
   report, to give you the best opportunity for your individual account.
