   " Our instructors love BigBlueButton. With our previous
   web-conferencing solution our users encountered many technical and
   usability problems that caused a lot of support effort on our part.
   With BigBlueButton, the support issues are almost non-existent. We are
   constantly impressed with the level of quality in this open source
   project and it works without any prior knowledge. "
   Marc Matthes
   Director of Computer Networking Programs and Program Developer,
   Distance Learning Department, Iowa Central Community College

Comments from Chris Kenniburg

   September 1, 2010 by BigBlueButton Team

   Chris Kenniburg, Web Master for Dearborn Schools (Dearborn, MI),
   checked out our beta WordPress plugin for BigBlueButton and in this
   recent blog post he wrote:

     The BigBlueButton (BBB) web meeting/conferencing server is truly a
     gem in the open source arena. It installs effortlessly via a few
     simple console commands on Ubuntu and updates even easier.

   Chris went on to say:

     For a K-12 school district looking to offer web meetings without a
     big budget, BBB works GREAT!

   Thanks Chris for the endorsement. We’ve built BigBlueButton for the
   distance education market, so in many ways we’ve built it for you!
