LET’S HACK THE CODE!

   Just six decades after Orville and Wilbur Wright launched the aviation
   age, President Kennedy pronounced a moonshot: fly people to the moon
   and back.  Eight years later, the mission was accomplished.  Now, six
   decades after James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the code of
   life, it is time to embark on another historic mission: hack the code
   of life and cure aging.
   —


   The Palo Alto Longevity Prize (the “Prize”) is a $1 million life
   science competition dedicated to ending aging.  Ours is one of a
   growing number of initiatives around the world pursuing this goal—the
   more shots on goal the better.  Through an incentive prize, our
   specific aim is to nurture innovations that end aging by restoring the
   body’s homeostatic capacity and promoting the extension of a sustained
   and healthy lifespan.

PALO ALTO PRIZE – TEAM APPROACH

   There are two prizes available and teams may compete for one or both
   prizes:
   • A $500,000 Homeostatic Capacity Prize will be awarded to the first
   team to demonstrate that it can restore homeostatic capacity (using
   heart rate variability as the surrogate measure) of an aging reference
   mammal to that of a young adult.

   • A $500,000 Longevity Demonstration  Prize will be awarded to the
   first Team that meets all the requirements of the Prize Requirements as
   determined by the Judging Panel in its sole discretion, including
   extending the mean lifespan of a wild-type mammalian intervention
   cohort by 50% relative to acceptable published natural history of
   untreated norms in a statistically significant (p<.05) manner, using a
   Statistical Model (as defined and approved in the official “Competition
   Agreement”). The intervention and control cohorts should be age and
   gender matched and should include an equal number of males and females.
     If you would like more details on the Prize Requirements please use
   the contact form at the bottom of this page. [INS: :INS]

   Each team participating in the Prize is responsible for funding 100% of
   its participation in the Prize including all research and development
   costs and publishing its work and/or the reproduction of results. To
   enable a rapid commercial path forward for the innovations, the sponsor
   of the Prize will be contributing an existing pool of relevant
   intellectual property to the Prize effort.

PALO ALTO PRIZE – PERSONAL STORIES

Sign up today!

   Innovation happens in the most magical ways and often it requires
   people from outside the field of study to see the challenge with a new
   perspective. If you are ready to sign up as a team to compete – please
   fill out an Intent to Participate Application If you have any questions
   or if you would like to review the Prize rules, please let us know.

LET’S DO THIS!

     “There is a possibility that the timed switch from a functional ANS
     to a dysfunctional ANS may be a key underlying mechanism of chronic
     diseases and aging.”

   Frank Longo, M.D. Professor and Chair, Department of Neurology and
   Neurological Sciences, Stanford University

     “The Palo Alto Longevity Prize has the potential to fundamentally
     impact humankind by unlocking the secrets to longevity and healthy
     aging.”

   Amir Dan Rubin President and CEO Stanford Hospital & Clinics

     “The answers we find with this prize could not only teach us how to
     enhance lifespan but more importantly brain function and human
     health in general.”

   Ben Barres, M.D., PH.D. Chairman, Department of Neurobiology, Stanford
   University

     “Health extension needs to happen sooner rather than later. I, for
     one, do not want to be part of the last generation that only lived
     to an average of 80 years.”

   Sonia Arrison Author 100 Plus, Associate Founder Singularity University

     “Prizes work. They attract the best minds to focus on a
     breakthrough, media to educate the public and the money necessary to
     support the innovators.”

   Keith Powers Managing Director, Engaged Partners

     “For far too long aging research is undercapitalized and over
     promoted in non rigorous contexts. Its great to finally see an
     effort to foster cogent science.”

   Laura Deming Founder, Longevity Fund

     “Heart rate variability is a powerful potential biomarker. This
     prize will attract the best and brightest to take on the full
     puzzle.”

   Nina Kjellson Managing Director, Interwest Ventures

     “As a venture investor, I am super excited to meet future teams and
     the potential opportunities that could result from this prize.”

   Steve Herrod Managing Director, General Catalyst Partners

WHY A PRIZE?

   Incentive prizes work because they attract:
   minds

Minds

   Prizes attract the best minds to focus on finding solutions to a
   specific area of innovation. From researchers at universities, to
   startups, to small teams within larger companies, prizes create a
   target for innovators to try to solve. Prize purses, advanced market
   commitments, and the glory of winning helps “pull” innovation in a
   specific direction. By creating a new playing field, prizes also help
   pull everyone together toward the common goal.
   media

Media

   Everyone loves a competition and everyone loves heroes, especially the
   media! When crafted and produced well, incentive prizes are a great way
   to tell stories and to educate the public about the area of discovery.
   They also provide a wonderful medium to create heroes out of the
   hard-working teams that make it happen.
   money

Money

   Once you have the best minds in the world focusing on a breakthrough
   area, capital will follow. Angel investors, venture capital funds, and
   the venture arms of corporations are always looking for the next
   breakthrough area and teams to invest in. Prizes help unearth who those
   teams are, and what they are working on related to the prize, and other
   products, services and intellectual property that they might have that
   are not related to the prize.
   WHY-PRIZES-WORK

     * Now is the time to launch this prize, because we have reached the
       point in science, where we really do have the opportunity to solve
       aging.
       Dr. Doris Taylor
     * The Palo Alto Prize enables us to attack moonshot problems
       Jin Lee
     * Give nature the tools and get out of the way
       Doris Taylor
     * We have the foundations that will allow us to live to 120 and we
       can do it.
       David Mendelowitz
     * The race against time is imminent. We need to act now
       David Mendelowitz
     * Every moment of our life is a race against time
       Jin Lee
     * The longer people live and the more productive they are the more
       they contribute to society
       Irving Zucker
     * We’ve reached a point in science where we really do have the
       opportunity to solve aging
       Doris Taylor
     * You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change
       something, build a new model that makes the existing model
       obsolete.
       R. Buckminster Fuller
     * If you keep us in this room long enough, we will solve aging
       Dr. Doris Taylor
     * Give nature the tools and get out of the way.
       Dr. Doris Taylor
     * We have to reinvent ourselves to make progress

ABOUT US

   The Palo Alto Prize is a newly established Silicon Valley-based
   initiative of the Race Against Time Foundation. The mission of the Palo
   Alto Prize is to encourage collaboration, foster innovation, and build
   a community to address the underlying causes of aging. In addition to
   the $1 million of cash prizes, the Palo Alto Prize is also working with
   a number of angel investors, venture capital firms, corporate venture
   arms, institutions and private foundations to provide access to
   additional capital to the teams during the competition. While the Palo
   Alto Prize will help facilitate introductions, all transactions and due
   diligence will be done privately between the teams and potential
   investors and philanthropists.

   The Race Against Time (dba The Hero Science Foundation www.herosf.org)
   is a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit organization (Tax ID: 47-2823482)
   created to raise public awareness and financial support for basic
   biomedical research related to increasing our health span and defining
   the fundamental biological mechanisms that prevent age-related diseases
   and disabilities.

   About the prize sponsor:

   Dr. Joon Yun, M.D., is the President of Palo Alto Investors, LLC,
   founded in 1989 with over $2 billion in assets under management
   invested in healthcare and the founder of the Palo Alto Institute, a

   the clinical staff at Stanford Hospital from 2000-2006. Dr. Yun
   received his Bachelor of Arts in biology from Harvard University and
   his Doctor of Medicine from Duke University School of Medicine. Learn

$1,000,000 LONGEVITY PRIZE + 10 TEAMS = LET’S GO!

   March 16, 2016 / Comments Off on $1,000,000 LONGEVITY PRIZE + 10 TEAMS
   = LET’S GO!

   On September 9, 2014 we announced the Palo Alto Prize, a $1M initiative
   to foster innovations that will ultimately help people live
   significantly healthier and longer lives as a result of better health.
   The initiative was designed to have two parts, a $500,000 Longevity
   Demonstration Prize and a $500,000 Homeostatic Capacity Prize.

   Historically, incentive prizes have proven to be a very effective tool
   to foster innovation in specific areas of science and discovery. They
   create problem-solving ecosystems. The ecosystem works because the
   prize purse and target pull innovation towards a specific goal while
   also attracting minds, media and money to help push from all sides.
   When all cylinders are firing amazing things can happen, entire
   industries can be created, we discover new heroes, and public opinion
   changes forever.

   Today, we are excited to announce the names of the ten teams that have
   officially registered for the $500,000 Palo Alto Longevity
   Demonstration Prize, a three year global competition co-created and
   sponsored by Dr. Joon Yun that challenges teams from all over the world
   to “hack the aging code” to improve our health and extend lifespan.

   Here is a quick intro video about the prize:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/epy6CEHRRHI?rel=0

   Each of the 10 teams (listed below with videos of their approaches) are
   from top universities and private labs from North America and all over
   the world. They have a wide range of proposed approaches to win the
   prize including (but not limited to) stem cells, genetic modification,
   modified messenger RNA encoding telomerase, modulation of peripheral
   metabolism, PAI-1 signaling, antioxidants/free radicals, and
   manipulation of nested biorhythms. The first of the following ten teams
   to demonstrate a method of extending the lifespan of an animal by 50%
   will win the prize.

   We would like to thank Dr. Joon Yun for his support and leadership in
   launching this effort. Without visionary philanthropists like Dr. Yun
   prizes like the Palo Alto Prize would not be possible. Dr. Yun is the
   President of Palo Alto Investors, LLC and the founder of the Palo Alto
   Institute, a nonprofit think-tank that has been providing operational
   support for the Palo Alto Prize. As a medical doctor and healthcare
   investor, Dr. Yun has a unique perspective into medicine and the state
   of the industry. And while he believes that the current healthcare
   system is doing a remarkable job of addressing the diseases of aging,
   he helped launch the prize because he believes that “Addressing the
   diseases of aging without solving the underlying process of aging
   produces escalating effects on health care spending.”

   We created the Race Against Time Foundation in order to raise public
   awareness and financial support for basic biomedical research related
   to increasing our health span and defining the fundamental biological
   mechanisms that prevent age-related diseases and disabilities. Based on
   the exponential rate of medical breakthroughs, we believe the question
   is not ifwe can crack the aging code and solve all major health
   challenges — but whenwill it happen. We are in a race against time and
   it is up to us if to decided if that timeframe is 5 years, 50 years or
   500 years.

   What can you do to get involved?

   The best way that you can get involved is to support science and
   support the scientists. Take a look at each of our team profiles and
   reach out to them directly. Every day millions of scientists work to
   make our lives better. They are society’s real super heroes. These
   heroes work tirelessly to create and design everything around us, from
   rocket ships, to clean water filters, to cures for disease. Many of
   these heroes (like our teams) are dedicating their lives to research
   that will lead to discoveries that will increase our health span by
   helping us all live healthier and longer lives. Please support a
   scientist today!

   We are excited to see what the teams come up with, but we also know
   that this prize is just one shot on goal. We encourage more public and
   private prizes and other industry efforts to help move the industry
   forward.

Who Will be First to “Hack the Code” of Aging?

Who Will be First to “Hack the Code” of Aging?

   A RACE TO THE FINISH
   By Brooke Borel |  February 23, 2016
   birthday-cake
   Can Silicon Valley give us more birthdays?

   In 2014, Joon Yun, founder of the Palo Alto Institute in California,
   announced the $1 million Palo Alto Longevity Prize. Its goal: to “hack
   the code” of aging.

   The first half will go to the first group to restore homeostatic
   capacity—the body’s ability to stabilize after experiencing stress.
   “Until midlife, it is so pervasively effective that we don’t realize we
   have homeostatic capacity until we start losing it,” Yun says.

   The hitch is, no one knows how to measure it, and so the prize will use
   proxies such as heart-rate variability, and award whichever team can
   get an aging animal’s heart pumping like it’s young again. The other
   half of the prize will go to the first group that’s able to extend the
   life of a mammal by 50 percent.

   So far, 30 teams from across the world have signed up to compete,
   including research groups at schools such as Stanford University and
   the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and teams from the private
   sector, such as Volt Health, led by a medical-device designer. The
   clock is ticking—they have until December 31, 2019 to win.

Private Investigators

   Some of the biggest names in biotech have joined the effort to
   forestall aging. They’re well-funded, well-staffed, and largely working
   in secret.

Calico

   Google founded Calico to develop therapies for age-related diseases.
   It’s brought firepower to the effort: Calico’s leaders include former
   heads of drug companies and top-notch experts on genomics and aging.
   Together with a partner, it has pledged up to $1.5 billion for
   research—more than the public National Institute on Aging earmarked for
   research in 2016.

CyteGen

   In late 2015, Breakout Labs, a philanthropic venture founded by Peter
   Thiel, announced CyteGen will be folded into its portfolio of “radical
   science companies.” CyteGen’s goal: to use a proprietary drug-discovery
   platform in order to find health-span-increasing drugs that target cell
   metabolism.

Human Longevity Inc.

   Geneticist J. Craig Venter took aim at longevity with the 2013 launch
   of Human Longevity Inc. In October, the company announced its first
   Health Nucleus facility, which offers personalized analysis of an
   individual’s genome. That data, in turn, will help build a whole-genome
   database that feeds research on risk factors for age-related diseases.

The Ethics Of Life Extension

   A treatment that extends life span might be tantalizing, but if it’s
   expensive or inaccessible, it could also make existing healthcare
   inequalities worse, says Alexander Capron, an expert in health policy
   and ethics at the University of Southern California Gould School of
   Law. Life expectancy in the U.S. is already tied strongly to
   socioeconomic status: People in wealthier counties, such as those
   surrounding New York City, tend to live longer, while those in the
   rural South face a shorter life expectancy and poorer health.

   Life Expectancy at Birth, 2013

   Colors represent how many years a person born in 2013 can expect to
   live, by U.S. county. Map based on data from the Institute for Health
   Metrics and Evaluation—Popular Science combined figures for women and
   men to obtain a total average life expectancy at birth.

Who Needs A Body Anyway?

   martine-rothblatt Martine Rothblatt is many things—CEO of biotech
   company United Therapeutics, founder of Sirius Radio, inventor, lawyer,
   and medical ethicist—but foremost, she is a futurist. Specifically,
   Rothblatt believes in transhumanism, or the indefinite extension of
   human life through technology.

   As a result of the growing ubiquity of digital devices, I believe that
   all of our mannerisms, recollections, feelings, beliefs,
   attitudes—everything about our lives—will be collected and stored in
   the cloud. We are creating a simulacrum of ourselves outside our
   bodies. I call this our “mindfile.”

   At the same time, we’re developing ever-better digital assistants that
   use voice recognition and artificial intelligence. They even have
   different personalities, like Siri. I call this software “mindware.”
   And I think the convergence of mindfiles and mindware will produce a
   seemingly conscious replica of any person—a “mindclone.”

   One of the projects my company has been working on is a cognitive
   enabler for Alzheimer’s disease. An individual beginning to suffer
   would be able to store enough personality and recollections digitally
   that, when combined with a camera and voice recognition, he or she can
   interact with friends and family through the technology—even once no
   longer able to do so through his or her own brain.

   This very naturally leads to the question, how good does an enabler
   have to be before it is considered part and parcel with the person
   itself? And when the person’s body finally succumbs, does the enabler
   claim legal rights?

   People have always been afraid of things that are different and weird.
   But when the weirdness of cyberconsciousness blends with the love for
   family members, people will see cyberconsciousness as innocuous. By
   2030, I believe there will be a social movement of people whose
   grandmother, sister, or friend has a fatal disease, and who say their
   mindclones should be legally recognized as a continuation of
   themselves.

   Ultimately, the Internet of Things will enable mindclones to travel,
   present themselves ever more freely and with greater ubiquity, and even
   transcend legal death. —As told to Matt Giles

The Scientific Quest to Cure Aging

   March 9, 2016 / Comments Off on The Scientific Quest to Cure Aging

The Scientific Quest to Cure Aging

    ASHLEY WELCH | CBS NEWS | January 27, 2016, 6:00 AM

   hourglass

   It’s a pursuit that seems more like the plot of a science fiction movie
   than an actual goal of serious researchers around the world. But a
   number of scientists are fiercely working toward what was once only
   attainable in fables and fairy tales: they want to end aging.

   The quest has even inspired a competition with a monetary prize from
   that hub of innovation, Silicon Valley. The Palo Alto Longevity Prize,
   founded by Dr. Joon Yun, a radiologist who heads Palo Alto Investors,
   is offering $1 million in prize money as a way to urge researchers
   figure out how to “hack the code” of aging.

   While those in the growing field of longevity research admit the task
   at hand is expansive and complex, they say big advancements have
   already been made and expect to see more in the near future.

   “The goal is similar to all medical research which is to make people
   healthier and keep people alive longer so we can have more productive
   lives and not be such a burden to society,” David Sinclair, Ph.D., a
   professor of genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for
   the Biology of Aging at the Harvard Medical School, told CBS News.

   The Australian-born biologist, who sits on the board of the Palo Alto
   Longevity Prize, discovered in 2013 that Nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide (NAD), a chemical found in every living organism, can turn
   on defenses against aging, though its levels decrease the older we
   grow.

   Sinclair envisions a time — maybe not too far away — when doctors will
   prescribe medicine utilizing these findings to curb aging.

   “We are finding genes and molecules that we can take as a pill that
   would slow down every disease from Alzheimer’s to diabetes to cancer
   plus give us more energy during our whole lives,” he said. “Side
   effects would be living longer, but the ultimate goal is there will be
   a future — maybe it’s only a decade or two away — where people won’t
   have to worry about getting these diseases in their 60s or 70s but can
   put that off to 100 or 110.”

   The Palo Alto Prize is meant to inspire and reward such innovations.
   The competition was announced in 2014 and final registration closed
   this past December. Winning research teams in two different categories
   — who will be awarded $500,000 each — are expected to be announced by
   the end of 2019.

   The roughly 30 teams that are participating in the competition are
   taking a broad range of approaches, from stem cell therapies to gene
   modification to hormonal treatments to behavioral and nutritional
   interventions. Because of the nature of the competition, specifics
   about each project have not been disclosed to the public, but videos
   are available on the contest’s website with teams introducing their
   research.

   Quality versus quantity

   Yun is quick to point out that the aim of most of longevity research —
   and the ultimate goal of the Palo Alto competition — is not simply to
   extend life in terms of sheer number of years lived, but to enhance
   quality of life, as well. He explains this in terms of homeostatic
   capacity, which refers to the body’s natural ability to fight off
   stressors in order to remain healthy.

   “Homeostatic capacity is probably nature’s greatest gift. It’s our
   ability to self-tune in response to stressors,” he told CBS News. “It
   is so pervasively effective that we don’t even realize we have it until
   we start losing it.”

   Yun went on to explain that when we’re young and healthy, we don’t even
   notice it. “That is the true definition of health,” he said. “When
   you’re feeling healthy, you’re feeling nothing because you’re in
   homeostasis. That’s very different from what marketers try to say, that
   healthy means vitality and energy.”

   Then, after about the age of 40, our homeostatic capacity starts to
   decline. “We’re more vulnerable to the forces of aging. All of a sudden
   you’re finding that your body can’t get back to homeostasis on its
   own,” Yun said. “It’s hard to ride roller coasters. It’s hard to
   recover from injuries, from a late night, from jet lag. Foods we may
   have once loved, we are no longer able to tolerate. All of this happens
   at once, and these are all things everyone can feel. But think of all
   the things you can’t feel.”

   He gave the example that when people are young and healthy and their
   blood pressure or sugar level is high, the body brings itself back to
   homeostasis on its own. But as we age, the body loses this ability.

   “We give these things names like diabetes and hypertension,” he said.
   “But maybe it’s all really the same process that is the decline of
   homeostatic capacity.”

   When asked why he set up the competition to find ways to solve these
   problems of aging, rather than invest the money directly into research,
   Yun said he thinks the nature of a contest yields the best results.

   “What’s wonderful about prizes is that you set a goal and you’re
   essentially inviting a diversity of options to compete and see which
   one wins,” he said. “It’s very much like how nature and evolution
   work.”

   “What is it that you’re living for?”

   But not everyone thinks the quest to cure aging is well-founded or
   wise. Several prominent bioethicists have spoken out against such
   efforts to extend longevity.

   Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and Chair of the Department of
   Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, is
   among them. In 2014, Emanuel penned a controversial article for the
   Atlantic titled “Why I Hope to Die at 75.”

   “I think it’s fascinating that so many people are obsessed with living
   long,” he told CBS News. “If you ask most people about quality versus
   quantity of life, they will say in a second that quality is what’s
   really important. And then you probe and you find that people are so
   psychologically scared of dying and not having lived out a meaningful
   life. But when you talk to older people, many of them are sort of tired
   of life. They’ve lost friends and loved ones or activities are
   restricted and maybe it’s not so great after all.”

   For Emanuel, such frank discussions with older adults and time spent in
   self-reflection led him to the decision that he does not aspire to an
   exceptionally long life and would not take steps to extend it.

   In the Atlantic article, Emanuel, who is in good health in his late
   50s, made clear that he is not looking to end his life through suicide
   or euthanasia. Rather, at 75, he believes he will be content enough
   with his life to not actively try to prolong it. “I think this manic
   desperation to endlessly extend life is misguided and potentially
   destructive,” he wrote.

   “The real issue is what makes a meaningful life,” he told CBS News. “Is
   it living as long as you can or is there something else going on? If
   you ask me, it’s the something else we really ought to care about. What
   is it that you’re living for?”

   When asked about the views expressed by longevity researchers that
   their work focuses not just on extending years lived, but on increasing
   quality of life, Emanuel answered with plenty of skepticism.

   “How are you going to cure all of the causes of death?” he asked.
   “That’s kind of a way for scientists to rationalize what they’re doing.
   I can understand that it’s an interesting puzzle to solve and many
   people are passionate about it, but I don’t think it’s something we
   ought to be doing.”

   Of course, longevity researchers vehemently disagree and say such
   objections are misguided.

   “What we’re talking about is being able to prevent and treat the major
   diseases of society,” Sinclair said. “Cancer at one point in human
   history was totally natural. Heart disease was unavoidable. Nobody now
   would say, ‘Oh, cancer is natural and we shouldn’t work on it.’ We use
   our technology to lead better lives and make the world a better place
   and improve the human condition and that’s what we’re aiming to do
   here.”

El Combate Antiedad De Silicon Valley

   Los multimillonarios del valle tecnológico tienen un nuevo objetivo:
   duplicar nuestra esperanza de vida y plantar cara a dolencias como el
   párkinson o el cáncer. Hablamos de células madre, genética, virus y
   nanorrobots con los inversores y cientí!cos que lideran la búsqueda del
   elixir de la juventud

   Texto ! María ovelar fotos ! Adam whitehead
   Realización ! Svetlana tanakina

   La comparativa podría ilustrar un manual de Biología del colegio. «El
   ser humano es como un coche, si reparamos el daño acumulado y lo
   mantenemos en buen estado, seguirá marchando correctamente. El
   organismo está programado para funcionar bien cuando el deterioro es
   mínimo. Arreglarlo cuando se ha roto es más complicado», opina Aubrey
   de Grey, un gerontólogo y biomédico inglés.

   Las consecuencias de su teoría no son tan sencillas. Podrían cambiarlo
   todo. «La esperanza de vida indefinida no es un imposible. Todavía no
   sabemos cuánto más viviremos, pero ya se habla de hasta los 1.000
   años», insiste este investigador de la Universidad de Cambridge y
   añade: «Envejecer se debe a la acumulación de los efectos negativos del
   metabolismo. Estos daños son los que nos terminan matando. Alargar la
   esperanza de vida pasa por prevenir enfermedades y gozar de buena
   salud».

   No es el único científico empeñado en encontrar el elixir de la eterna
   juventud. Cynthia Kenyon, una bióloga molecular, el #sico surcoreano
   Joon Yun o la bióloga Anne Wojcicki, compiten en la misma carrera.
   Detrás de estos visionarios, que algunos tildan de locos, están varios
   multimillonarios de Silicon Valley. «Hay que pensar a lo grande, solo
   los optimistas decidirán el futuro», opina Peter Thiel, cofundador de
   PayPal y uno de los primeros inversores de Facebook.

   Desde 2004, año en el que Thiel vendió PayPal a eBay, ha desembolsado
   millones de dólares en proyectos relacionados con la longevidad. La
   fortuna de este filántropo ronda los 2.200 millones de dólares (1.761
   millones de euros), según Forbes. «Dicen que la muerte es algo natural,
   que es parte de la vida, no estoy de acuerdo. En mi opinión es un
   problema con solución científica», remata.

   Google, Facebook, Napster y Netscape son otras de las compañías detrás
   de este objetivo. «Lo importante del fenómeno Silicon Valley es su
   interés por desentra- ñar los mecanismos moleculares del envejecimiento
   como vía para encontrar fármacos para enfermedades mortales», dice
   María Blasco, directora del Centro Nacional de Investigaciones
   Oncológicas (Cnio).
     * ¿Cuáles son sus armas?
       En estas empresas no solo hay científicos, también informáticos y
       emprendedores. Están acostumbrados a manejar millones de datos, a
       interpretarlos y gestionarlos con un fin y a traducirlos en
       tecnología. Su enfoque es diferente: aplican la filoso#a de las
       puntocom al problema de la muerte. «Los investigadores se centran
       en descubrir cosas, pero luego no saben qué hacer con sus
       conclusiones. Resultado: los avances no llegan. Los ingenieros, en
       cambio, somos más creativos y buscamos maneras de usar esa
       información», explica De Grey a S Moda.
     * ¿Qué analizan? Algunas
       empresas están estudiando la genética de las especies con una larga

   Dos gigantes tecnológicos se unieron en 2013 para «concebir
   procedimientos que permitan vivir más y de manera más saludable».
   Detrás de Calico (California Life Company), están el conocido buscador
   y Arthur D. Levinson, presidente de Apple. «Estudian el envejecimiento
   a nivel molecular porque están convencidos de que ese proceso es el
   causante de la mayoría de las enfermedades. Su misión es alargar el
   tiempo en el que el organismo es biológicamente joven», explica Blasco.

       Kenyon, una estrella de la biología molecular. La estadounidense
       logró duplicar la esperanza de vida del gusano caenorhabditis
       elegans. ¿Cómo? Inhibiendo el gen daf-2, conocido como «gen de la
       muerte». Kenyon, por supuesto, pretende repetir la hazaña en
       humanos.
     * Partículas bondadosas. Aquí va otra de las iniciativas de Calico:

       complicados de detectar, como el de páncreas. Solo el 3% de los

   ¿El envejecimiento tiene solución médica?
   Sí, como también la tienen el cáncer, el alzhéimer y otras
   enfermedades.

   ¿Qué terapia puede ayudar a esquivarlo?
   Es mejor no hablar de un protocolo, sino de varios: la clave pasa por
   combinar tratamientos de células madre y genéticos con medicamentos.

   Su idea es la siguiente: somos como un coche vintage, si invertimos
   tiempo en el mantenimiento, nuestra salud no fallará.

   Todas las terapias de [mi fundación] SENS Research se centran en la
   prevención. El organismo está preparado para funcionar bien cuando
   acumula pocos daños. Así que solo necesitamos reparar las averías con
   frecuencia y bien para funcionar; como con un coche.

   ¿Qué proyecto de su institución destacaría? Estamos trabajando con una
   enzima bacteriana capaz de prevenir los ataques al corazón y los
   derrames. Esta sustancia rompe el colesterol oxidado, cuya acumulación
   produce arteriosclerosis. Estamos avanzando mucho, pero algunos
   descubrimientos tardarán 20 años en llegar.

   ¿Cuántos años más viviremos? Es difícil aventurar una cifra porque la
   muerte no depende de nuestra edad, sino de los factores que la causan.
   Pero… tal vez la persona que alcance los 1.000 años ya esté entre
   nosotros.

   ¿El negocio antiedad será el más grande del mundo? Lo será. Hoy se basa
   en fórmulas con una eficacia limitada y ya es enorme; imagine cuando
   lancemos productos en los que ya estamos trabajando, con muchos
   beneficios… Será un boom.

   Tienen sus detractores: «Me preocupa que la motivación de estos
   filántropos sea su ego y no el deseo por el bien plural», opinaba en el
   diario The Washington Post Laurie Zoloth, bioética de la Universidad de
   Northwestern.
     * ¿Con!icto moral? Antaño, siempre según este rotativo, el Gobierno
       estadounidense financiaba dos tercios de la investigación
       científica; hoy, detrás de ese porcentaje están organismos
       privados. El argumento de los críticos: a estos multimillonarios
       les faltan escrúpulos y les sobra impaciencia, quieren resultados
       ya. Pero al contrario del Estado, no deben dar cuentas a nadie.
       Otro dato importante: los sueldos y ayudas proporcionados por estos
       mecenas triplican los de organismos como las universidades. Google,
       por ejemplo, ha invertido 750 millones de dólares en Calico. La
       alegoría de esta lucha contrarreloj es Peter Thiel, para quien la
       muerte es «el gran enemigo de la humanidad». Thiel ha financiado
       proyectos como un sistema de refrigeración de órganos (que permite
       conservarlos indefinidamente; de la Fundación SENS) y una
       tecnología capaz de fabricar hueso a través de células madre (para
       sustituir los rotos; de la compañía EpiBone).

       trabajan en desentrañar los mecanismos moleculares de
       envejecimiento celular. Carlos López-Otín, Manuel Serrano y yo
       publicamos un estudio en 2013 en la prestigiosa revista Cell»,
       explica Blasco. En el mismo aseguraban que al combatir el
       envejecimiento se lucha contra el cáncer y otras enfermedades. «Mi
       equipo consiguió prolongar la vida de los ratones en un 40% gracias
       a la enzima de la telomerasa que recibió el premio Nobel de
       Medicina», añade.

04. ¿Pocas nueces?

   Al final todo se reduce a la receta de la abuela. ¿Cuáles son las
   mejores estrategias para prevenir el envejecimiento y mitigar las
   arrugas, el sobrepeso y las enfermedades? «No existen los milagros,
   solo podemos hacer lo que nos aconsejaron nuestras madres: no fumar, no
   engordar, hacer deporte, comer de todo», responde De Grey.
     * Palabra de experto. Cinthya Kenyon comprobó que el azúcar acortaba
       la vida de sus gusanos. El régimen de la estadounidense se basa
       desde entonces en alimentos con un índice glucémico bajo, como las
       manzanas, la avena o las lentejas. «Envejecemos y enfermamos a
       distintas velocidades debido a la genética y al estilo de vida.
       Cuanto más dañemos las células, más rápido quemaremos el tiempo de
       vida saludable», afirma Blasco. Y añade: «Los países más longevos
       son los nórdicos. También son los que tienen mayor índice de
       envejecimiento activo sin enfermedades».
     * ¿Cuánto queda? «En los últimos 10 o 15 años se han publicado
       trabajos muy serios que demuestran la importancia del proceso de
       envejecimiento en la enfermedad. Pero los avances científicos van
       10 o 20 años por delante de los beneficios que puedan aportar a la
       sociedad», nos recuerda Blasco.

En busca del santo grial

   CUÁL ES EL ELIXIR PARA ALCANZAR LA ETERNIDAD?

   Vacunas. Para eliminar tumores ya se emplean virus como el adenovirus
   (causante de resfriados) y la vaccinia (de la viruela) que penetran en
   las unidades cancerígenas.

   Telómeros. «Rejuvenecer los telómeros de los ratones alarga su
   longevidad en un 40%; en humanos equivaldría a vivir hasta los 115 o
   120 años», dice Blasco, del CNIO.

How to Make the Most of Longer Lives

   MARC FREEDMAN

   May 31, 2015 11:01 p.m. ET

   The first person to live to 150 is alive today.

   For many months I drove home past a financial-services billboard
   advertising this dramatic claim, followed by the punch line: “Let’s get
   ready for a longer retirement.”

   The focus of that message, of course, is money—the size of our nest
   eggs. But the words highlight a far bigger challenge. In the early
   decades of the 21st century, we are pushing, rapidly, to extend our
   lives. But we’re paying scant attention to how we should make the most
   of that additional time.

   Where are the innovations designed to make these bonus decades actually
   worth living? Aside from the mind-boggling prospect of saving for 50-
   or 75-year retirements, how do we make these new chapters both
   fulfilling for individuals and sustainable for society?

   Life extension without social innovation is a recipe for dystopian
   disaster—what one critic characterizes as “the coming death shortage,”
   invoking images not only of endless (and unaffordable) retirements but
   of a society loaded down by a population explosion of the idle old.

   As thousands of baby boomers each day surge into their 60s and 70s,
   it’s time to focus on enriching lives, not just lengthening them; on
   providing purpose and productivity, not just perpetuity.

   We need to marshal imagination and ingenuity to devise new strategies
   for enhancing the whole range of experiences in later life, including
   education, faith, housing, work, finance and community.

   EN-AB343B_GAP_P_20150526160056

   ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

   Here are six ideas to launch us on that path.

Come up with a new name for this new chapter of life.

   Naming a phase of life—giving it a coherent identity—does more than
   most people realize to make life, and society, work better. It creates
   a framework for constructing the pathways, products and policies
   required to make the most of this period. And so it should be with the
   new chapter taking shape between, roughly, ages 55 and 75.

   Consider: One hundred years ago, we worried about a profusion of young
   people who were neither children nor adults. In 1904, G. Stanley Hall,
   the great American psychologist, helped put “adolescence” on the map
   with his seminal book of that name. Here, then, was a framework around
   which educators, legislators and entrepreneurs could begin developing
   new arrangements to make the most of that period.

   Today, of course, we take “adolescence” for granted. But the invention
   of that stage of life acted as a stimulus for, among other
   breakthroughs, making high-school education widespread and expanding
   child-labor laws. (Although it did take several decades after Hall’s
   treatise for the “teenage” label to become ubiquitous.)

   Let’s realize the same benefits for the new phase taking shape after
   midlife, starting with the nomenclature. What should we call this
   emerging period between our middle years and old age? Observers have
   suggested the “third chapter,” “adulthood II,” even “middlescence.”
   (Interestingly, G. Stanley Hall was among the first to suggest a new
   stage between our middle years and old age, describing it, poetically,
   as an Indian summer.)

Make the transition as easy as possible.

   Remember the old rites of passage—the retirement party, the gold watch,
   the RV trip? As we create a new life chapter beyond midlife, we need to
   afford people the time and space to move to what’s next.

   EN-AB345_GAPcvr_16U_20150526130910

   It’s common for young people to have four years of college to navigate
   the developmental passage from youth to adulthood, and now increasingly
   we are throwing in gap years before or after. But what about their
   parents? They’ve been laboring long hours and juggling the
   responsibilities of family, and are now heading into a stage of life
   that doesn’t have a name, much less a clear road map. There should be a
   gap year—or at least a few bridge months—for grown-ups to take a
   breather and figure out their next steps.

   More individuals at this juncture seem to agree. Research from RAND
   Corp. reveals that a significant segment of the population is already
   retiring for a year or two, with every intention of returning to work
   following that respite. In other words, they are using the rubric of
   retirement to grant themselves a much-needed sabbatical—to take some
   time to rest up before readying for what comes next.

   Still, theirs remains essentially a do-it-yourself process. It’s time
   to help make this post-midlife passage more efficient and suited to
   preparing individuals emotionally and spiritually for what lies ahead.

   Some promising approaches are starting to emerge. Last fall, Rabbi
   Laura Geller of Los Angeles brought together a group of area
   congregations to think about what these new rites of passage might look
   like in the context of Judaism—observing that her religion’s life
   markers derive largely from biblical times, when lives were far shorter
   than today.

   One answer: a kind of bar mitzvah for those moving into a new identity
   beyond midlife but far from the end of life, aimed at helping
   individuals reset their priorities and develop the right frame of mind
   for navigating their next phase, with particular focus on questions of
   leaving a legacy and how they might engage in “tikkun olam,” healing
   the world.

   EN-AB363_GAPjmp_16U_20150526131509

   Another faith-infused effort is the Halftime Institute, which blends
   precepts of Christian faith with ideas from management gurus like Peter
   Drucker and Jim Collins, to help individuals navigate the passage “from
   success to significance.” Among other things, the Halftime Institute’s
   programs help members find their calling through developing “a personal
   plan for spiritual growth, a life mission statement and a clear action
   plan.”

   Such rites and routes also have a place in our secular lives. I’ll soon
   be returning for my 35th college reunion, like so many other boomers
   who were part of the dramatic expansion of higher education in the
   1960s and 1970s. Reunions are a tailor-made opportunity to help
   individuals graduate into the second half of adulthood, using to full
   advantage their return to a setting associated with new beginnings, a
   sense of possibility and community.

   Already a number of higher-education institutions are offering reunion
   workshops on the subject of “what’s next.” Others have gone further.
   Northwestern University conducted a two-part webinar for alumni helping
   them consider and prepare for second acts aimed at improving prospects
   for future generations, featuring the accounts of classmates who had
   navigated that journey.

Design schools for the second half of life.

   Nearly 50 years ago, we pioneered lifelong learning for seniors—a
   notable advance, but let’s face it: All too often these programs are
   great for mental stimulation but ill-suited to launching individuals
   into new life chapters. Catching up on the Renaissance masters or
   mapping your family’s genealogy can take you only so far.

   What we need now is school designed for the second half of life,
   helping people retool to continue to earn an income, maintain a sense
   of engagement, and adapt to fresh challenges by teaching them new
   skills and helping them plan their encore careers.

   In recent years, two elite universities—Harvard and Stanford—have
   broken important new ground, introducing yearlong programs to fill
   these needs. Both involve reflection, learning, interaction with
   colleagues, and the chance to explore options for a next act of purpose
   and productivity. Both offer an opportunity to customize an
   interdisciplinary course of study with an eye to helping students
   launch second acts as social entrepreneurs or move into new
   organizational roles drawing on past experience in creative ways.

   But this is only a beginning, albeit a promising one.

   What’s warranted now is a far more broad-based effort. We need a system
   of easily accessible and affordable opportunities for all those
   interested in working beyond traditional retirement age, one that
   includes more community-college and continuing-education options, and
   that builds on existing trends in education innovation, including
   online courses and the competency-based movement to provide credit for
   experience and learning acquired outside the classroom.

   There’s some movement to make that happen: In March, two dozen leaders
   from across higher education came together at New York University to
   discuss democratizing and expanding their offerings for individuals
   moving beyond midlife. If they succeed, these trailblazers might not
   only further the reinvention of school for the second half of life but
   rewrite the educational script entirely.

   After all, why is it that we load up all our higher education and
   higher-education spending in life’s first two dozen years, when
   individuals have so many decades stretching out in front of them? It’s
   hard to know at 20 what we’ll want or need to know at 50 or 60. That’s
   why we should develop an approach to learning that allows for multiple
   opportunities to renew and retrain across the extended life course of
   the 21st century.

Figure out how to finance the bonus years.

   Along with fashioning new kinds of education and career pathways, we
   should help ensure that Americans are able to pay for them—and for all
   those years being added to the lifespan.

   Financial-services companies could provide a great service through
   creating and marketing what might be called individual purpose
   accounts, or IPAs—a kind of 529 savings plan for grown-ups. Such plans
   could help subsidize the new pathways to un-retirement, funding further
   education and other learning opportunities. They might also complement
   individual retirement accounts and related savings vehicles for
   retirement itself.

   Another potentially far-reaching idea: Allow people 50 and older to
   take a single early year of Social Security to retool for their next
   career, whether by going back to school or doing an internship, in
   exchange for working an actuarially adjusted period later before
   receiving full benefits.

   Doing so promises a win-win: helping individuals bolster their finances
   through working longer, while also enabling society to realize the
   talent windfall present in the older population, especially in
   high-growth fields like health care. Some people will earn a robust
   living, while others will use their new skills in part-time or flexible
   jobs that fill a financial gap and allow them to delay dipping into
   retirement funds.

Help the generations come together.

   For half a century, we’ve done much to keep young and old apart,
   especially in the realm of housing. Yet age-segregated housing for
   retirees runs against the grain of everything we know about healthy
   development in the post-midlife period, a time when connections with
   younger generations are linked to higher rates of happiness for older
   people. What we need instead: housing strategies that help to forge and
   solidify bonds among the generations.

   One compelling example is Bridge Meadows. This housing development in
   Portland, Ore., brings together families raising foster children with
   older people of modest means, who receive reduced rents in return for
   volunteer work with the adoptive families living in the community:
   everything from baby sitting and playing catch with children to working
   on arts-and-crafts projects and making meals. It’s an arrangement that
   makes both economic and common sense, filling the fundamental human
   need for community and connection.

   I’d like to see more housing development animated by that same
   compelling vision—especially as more families show an interest in
   moving in together, sometimes with three or four generations residing
   under the same roof. (A 2011 study by the nonprofit Generations United
   found that approximately one in six Americans resides in a
   multigenerational household, a 10% jump since the start of the
   recession.) We now likewise have an expanding cohort of individuals
   without children or grandchildren of their own, along with millions who
   don’t live anywhere near their younger relatives. These individuals
   might well be drawn to, and benefit from, such intergenerational
   settings.

   While we’re at it, we should create a Legacy Corps: one that recruits
   millions of older people to be extra “grandparents” for young people in
   early-learning programs and mentors for children growing up facing
   tough odds. In essence, it could be a new kind of Peace Corps for the
   generation that the Peace Corps was designed for in the first place.
   There’s a healthy dose of self-interest in such an enterprise for the
   boomers, who will be dependent on these young people as they move into
   their elderly years.

Get creative people thinking about how to improve our extra years.

   Innovations such as those I’ve just described have drawn little
   attention from investors to date. As a result, most remain small in
   scale, if not solely in the realm of ideas.

   Of 35 grants made by the federal government’s Social Innovation Fund
   since 2010, only one has directly targeted aging. Philanthropy isn’t
   doing any better. According to data from the Foundation Center, less
   than 2% of foundation money—often a powerful lever for social
   innovation—goes into aging.

   But there are promising signs in the U.K., where a new £50 million ($78
   million) investment from that country’s Big Lottery Fund is being used
   to improve the quality of life for older adults, including plans to
   support innovative initiatives in work, health and community
   engagement. We would be smart to develop our own version.

   Prizes are another great option for attracting talent to tackle the
   issues surrounding second acts. A $1 million Palo Alto Longevity Prize,
   with a who’s who of Silicon Valley backing it, has been offered for the
   next big breakthrough in extending life. Why not use similar vehicles
   to achieve the same result in social innovation aimed at enriching the
   later years?

   The X Prize, for instance, is aimed at big innovations that benefit
   mankind. I’d like to see a prize for the innovation that does the most
   to increase the productivity and contribution of older people to
   society—especially since the founder of the X Prize Foundation, Peter
   Diamandis, is co-founder of the Human Longevity Inc. startup (along
   with genome pioneer J. Craig Venter), aimed at “extending the healthy
   human lifespan.”

***

   Does this agenda sound daunting? Here’s reassuring news. We’ve seen
   this challenge before—and met it.

   In 1961, John F. Kennedy took office eight days after the first White
   House Conference on Aging. Two years later, President Kennedy gave his
   most important speech on aging, declaring that America was on the brink
   of a longevity revolution, filled with promise but marked by a gap: We
   had added “years to life,” he pronounced; now it was time to add “life
   to those years.”

   In impressively short order, we closed that era’s gap, through first
   conceiving the idea of leisure-focused “golden years,” then proceeding
   to make this marketing slogan a cornerstone of the American dream. In a
   remarkable period of social invention, we fashioned senior centers and
   retirement communities, Elderhostel (now Road Scholar) and Institutes
   for Learning in Retirement, Medicare and the Older Americans Act. We
   not only enriched those later years, but set in motion the conditions
   that contributed to longer, healthier, more active lives.

   Now, as we prepare for the sixth White House Conference on Aging,
   taking place next month, and as the years added to life continue to
   trend upward, let’s rise to the occasion again, realizing the true
   promise of longevity for individuals and for nations.

   And let’s do it in time for the onrushing wave of baby boomers—but,
   most of all, for those young people projected to live even longer. I
   hope that when they sail by the virtual billboards of tomorrow,
   propelled by their self-driving cars, they will be greeted not by scary
   longevity scenarios but by an inviting vision of their own later years.

   Thank you for calling the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. This call
   may be recorded. If you are reporting the death or the near death of an
   Alcor member, please press two now.

   Anti-aging research is the next big thing in healthcare. Companies such
   as Calico and Human Longevity, both based in California, are pioneering
   genetic and pharmacological techniques to reduce the ravages of time on
   the human body. At the fringes of science, Alcor, an Arizona-based
   nonprofit, vitrifies dead people in hopes of reviving them at a later
   date, while Russian internet mogul Dmitry Itskov seeks to create
   cybernetic bodies to host human consciousness.

   Aging “is one of the great mysteries of biology,” says Dr. Thomas
   Rando, director of the Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at
   Stanford University. “If we begin to understand what the process of
   decline associated with aging is, and if we can slow that by targeting
   those mechanisms, then potentially one could alter its course.”

   The idea that death can be forestalled by a magical substance, usually
   the mystical waters of the Fountain of Youth, dates back at least to
   the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC. The “elixir of
   life” also appears in ancient Chinese and Indian legends and in
   alchemical texts from medieval Europe. The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce
   de León was thought to have quested throughout the New World in the
   16th century in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth.

   As living standards improved in the 20th century, the quest for eternal
   life was subsumed into modern medicine’s fight against infectious
   disease. The average American’s life expectancy rose from 70 in 1960 to
   almost 79 in 2012, according to the World Bank. Yet little attention
   was paid to extending good health into old age. Rather than dying at
   70, people now live to be far older, but often with a lesser quality of
   life.

   Serious anti-aging research only started about a decade ago. “Improving
   health is the goal, and longevity might be the consequence of the
   improvement,” says Dr. Joon Yun, president of hedge fund Palo Alto
   Investors and sponsor of the Palo Alto Longevity Prize, which funds
   anti-aging research.

   At the time, scientists interested in treating or preventing the
   impairments of aging were often seen as either out of touch or just
   plain kooky. “I remember talking to some people from [the healthcare
   company] Roche about 15 years ago about this notion of drugs that might
   target the aging process,” Rando says. “They thought that was
   ridiculous.”

   Two trends have since proved to be the foundation for longevity
   research: new discoveries in genomics and the ability to share
   information over the internet. But for the most part, longevity
   research has not been funded by conventional research institutes or
   biotech companies—as great as the payoff could be, there’s little to no
   short-term return. Instead, some of the world’s wealthiest and most
   visible entrepreneurs have taken up the challenge. Some have a
   background in medicine, but most of these investors come from the
   worlds of technology and engineering. That makes more than just
   financial sense. “It’s clear now that biology is an engineering
   project, whereas before that wasn’t so obvious,” says Sonia Arrison,
   author of 100 Plus, a book about the effects of superannuation.

   The prospects are encouraging: Participants in longevity research say
   they expect rapid gains in a matter of years and decades. It’s not
   unreasonable to think that today’s children could regularly crack 100
   or even 120.

   “It’s the holy grail of healthcare, extending a human lifespan,” says
   Dr. Peter Diamandis, cofounder of Human Longevity and CEO of the XPrize
   Foundation, which awards financial gifts for scientific and
   technological advancements. Yet there’s a downside to the prospect of
   extreme longevity: If people don’t maintain good health into their
   senescence, longevity could place enormous strain on economies and
   societies.

   And, of course, philosophical questions abound. What do highly
   successful people like Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison or Peter Thiel—or
   anyone else for that matter—gain by living a few years more? How will
   added longevity change age-old notions of the phases of life? Will
   longevity become, even more than it already is, a gift largely
   conferred on the wealthy?

   The research will not pause to answer these questions. Here are six
   successful entrepreneurs who have turned their energy—and their
   wealth—to the project of longer life.

grow_immortality_yun DR. JOON YUN

   Managing partner and president,
   Palo Alto Investors Sponsor, Palo Alto Longevity Prize

   “Nature endowed the greatest healthcare system in the world: It’s
   called our bodies,” Yun says, explaining why he endowed the $1 million
   Palo Alto Longevity Prize. “Our body is an incredible system that is
   able to self-heal.” Yet beginning in middle age, “it is more vulnerable
   to the slings and arrows of life.”

   Yun, 47, graduated from Harvard with a degree in evolutionary biology
   before getting his MD at Duke and joining Stanford’s clinical faculty.
   He signed on with Palo Alto Investors, a $1 billion healthcare
   investment fund, in 1998. His goal? To extend what he calls
   “healthspan”—our healthy years before we begin to decline—into middle
   and old age; if longer life is a consequence, so much the better.

   Under the current healthcare regime, Yun says, “we have been helping
   people live longer and stronger lives, but the trajectory is
   unsustainable. This idea of helping people live longer without solving
   the underlying cause of aging lends itself to exponential increases in
   healthcare spending.

   “This is an area of relative market dysfunction,” he adds. Biotech
   companies and healthcare providers are incentivized to treat diseases,
   not prevent them. Compounding the problem, increased healthspan is hard
   to measure; it requires long time spans, discouraging companies with
   short-term goals from pursuing it.

   Yun created the Longevity Prize to incentivize research in two areas:
   restoration of the body’s ability to repair and maintain itself, and
   extending the lifespan of a mammal by 50 percent. Preventing people
   from getting sick as they age, Yun says, is about “getting a lot more
   healthcare value for a lot less money.”

grow_immortality_itskov DMITRY ITSKOV

   Founder, New Media Stars, 2045 Initiative

   Itskov’s Facebook page displays a piece of promotional art from James
   Cameron’s 2009 movie, Avatar, with Itskov’s face pasted over it. The
   movie was about futuristic soldiers who transfer their minds to
   artificial bodies. Itskov, who launched Russian internet company New
   Media Stars in 1999, must have really liked Avatar, because in 2011 he
   founded the 2045 Initiative, a foundation that aims to transfer human
   consciousness into cybernetic bodies.

   Itskov, 34, has plotted the evolution of humanity from carbon-based
   life form to liberated machine sentience. By 2020, according to his
   website, he foresees the “widespread use of affordable android
   ‘avatars’ controlled by a ‘brain-computer’ interface.” By 2025, an
   “autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot
   ‘avatar’ will save people whose body is completely worn out.” By 2045,
   “substance-independent minds will receive new bodies with capacities
   far exceeding those of ordinary humans.”

   To get there, Itskov is investing in startups creating avatar
   technology, while the 2045 Initiative is designed to coordinate and
   support scientific advancement in the field.

grow_immortality_brin SERGEY BRIN

   Cofounder, Google backer, Calico

   On January 14, 2013, Brin posted on his Google+ page a photo of
   jellyfish suspended in the limpid water of a lake in Palau; because
   some jellyfish do not appear to die, they have become a focus of aging
   research. “No place in the world has made me consider my place in the
   universe like Jellyfish Lake,” Brin wrote. “Millions of creatures all
   drifting seemingly aimlessly, searching for light, for the energy to
   spawn so generations of their offspring may do the same years later. I
   take a small breath, sink toward the bottom, watching them in wonder
   and think, are we really so different?”

   This kind of thinking led Brin and Larry Page, his Google cofounder, to
   launch Calico in 2013 with money from the company’s venture capital
   arm, Google Ventures. (Brin is said to be considerably more involved.
   One possible reason why: Brin, 41, has a genetic mutation, LRRK2, which
   is thought to substantially increase the probability of developing
   Parkinson’s disease.) Calico’s stated goal is “to harness advanced
   technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls
   lifespan.” The company announced a $1.5 billion coinvestment with
   pharmaceutical company AbbVie in September 2014 to construct an R&D lab
   “focused on aging and age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration
   and cancer.”

   Calico’s approach is twofold. In the short term, the company is
   developing drugs to treat age-related diseases; in the long run, Calico
   hopes to gain a larger, more holistic understanding of why humans age
   and to fight aging using pharmacology.

   Calico is in a “unique situation in being able to invest in basic aging
   research without having to turn a profit for a long time,” Stanford’s
   Rando says. “So there’s the potential there to do something really
   big.”

   grow_immortality_ellison

LARRY ELLISON

   Executive chairman and CTO, Oracle
   Founder, Ellison medical Foundation

   Ellison, one of the most intriguing figures in Silicon Valley, gave
   more than $350 million for anti-aging research from 1997 to 2015,
   making him by far one of the largest sponsors of the field. With no
   tangible results in sight, he stopped making new grants in 2013, and
   has never publicly explained why. The foundation, however, still
   operates.

   When Ellison, now 70, established the foundation, “there wasn’t enough
   traction to allow any success in the field,” says Dr. Kevin Lee,
   executive director of the Ellison Medical Foundation. The research
   grants provided by the foundation subsequently “defined this as a
   problem that wasn’t being addressed.” Ellison’s support, Lee says,
   helped move anti-aging research from the scientific fringe to the
   mainstream. “The foundation’s timing was perfect in providing the
   seeding for this field to develop.”

grow_immortality_kurzweil RAY KURZWEIL

   Director of engineering, Google cofounder, Singularity University

   Kurzweil is the eccentric uncle of Silicon Valley. He invented the CCD
   flatbed scanner and a machine that reads text to the blind. The
   recipient of 20 honorary doctorates, he cofounded Singularity
   University in Silicon Valley in 2007. Its mission: to become the
   epicenter of theorizing about the “singularity,” the moment when
   artificial intelligence will surpass human minds, allegedly leading to
   a tech utopia. Kurzweil believes that anti-aging research, nutrition
   and nanotechnology, among other things, will “enable humans to live
   indefinitely,” according to a note he wrote for the Methuselah
   Foundation website.

   A major donor to the research-oriented Methuselah Foundation, Kurzweil,
   67, is also a member of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a
   nonprofit that cryonically preserves people when they die in the hope
   of one day bringing them back to life.

   “What’s the harm in rationalizing death?” Kurzweil wrote in 2004. “The
   harm is that in rationalizing something that is tragic, we fail to take
   the urgent action needed to avoid the tragedy.” As human lifespans
   grow, Kurzweil adds, “we are also going to merge with our technology
   and expand our cognitive and emotional capabilities, as well as the
   depth and richness of our intellectual, relational, artistic, sexual
   and emotional experiences many-fold.”

grow_immortality_thiel PETER THIEL

   Cofounder, PayPal, Palantir Technologies
   Backer, SENS Research Foundation, the Methuselah Foundation

   There are three approaches to death, Thiel recently told the Guardian:
   “You can accept it, you can deny it or you can fight it. I think our
   society is dominated by people who are into denial or acceptance, and I
   prefer to fight it.”

   Thiel, 47, has said that he plans to live to be 120. He runs, takes
   human growth hormone, adheres to a Paleo diet and eschews sugar. He has
   also donated at least $6 million to the SENS Research Foundation and
   the Methuselah Foundation, both longevity-research projects started by
   a Cambridge-educated biologist named Aubrey de Grey.

   “There’s 100,000 people or more dying every single day of aging or
   age-related causes,” de Grey says. “Mostly dying after a long period of
   decline and dependence and disease and general misery. So, you know,
   every single day that I bring the defeat of aging forward—which I
   probably do about once a month—I’m saving 100,000 lives. That’s pretty
   motivating.”

   Thiel said in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session last year that he
   prefers to invest in medical and research ventures when they resemble
   “software companies—a group of really committed founders with a clear
   vision of what they’re trying to do.”

   “The key thing about Peter Thiel is he has a high threshold of
   reputation tolerance,” the Methuselah Foundation’s CEO, David Gobel,
   says. “There is a very large number of millionaires and billionaires
   who are legitimately terrified of being pilloried and burned at the
   stake in the media, because it’s happened to them and it has
   consequences… I think he’s made a rational calculation that his
   reputation is not worth as much as the potential.”

TWO APPROACHES

   Some longevity organizations focus on bringing people back to life,
   others on keeping you from dying in the first place.

   HUMAN LONGEVITY, INC.

   A collaboration between cofounders Dr. Peter Diamandis, Dr. Robert
   Hariri and pioneering geneticist Dr. Craig Venter (see Q&A with Craig
   Venter), HLI may be the only serious competitor to Google Ventures’
   Calico. The company focuses on extending life through genomics and stem
   cell therapies, and specifically targets cardiovascular and
   neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

   HLI is “building the largest genome-sequencing facility on the planet,”
   Diamandis says. It will also compile microbiome, MRI and metabolism
   data. “It’s just a massive amount of data that would have been
   impossible to manipulate, fathom or mine even just five years ago,”
   Diamandis adds. “We’re targeting millions of data sets from millions of
   individuals from around the world, from across ages, from across
   disease groups and mining that to extract knowledge and information.”

   In January, the company announced a gene-sequencing agreement with
   biotech giant Genentech, which hopes to use Human Longevity’s findings
   to speed the discovery of new drugs.

   ALCOR LIFE EXTENSION FOUNDATION

   Alcor vitrifies people after they die in the hopes of bringing them
   back to life in the future. Members’ bodies are infused with a
   “cryoprotective solution, a kind of medical antifreeze” after they die,
   Alcor CEO Max More says, before being cooled and stored in liquid
   nitrogen.

   The cost? At least $200,000 for the entire body or $80,000 for just the
   brain, and it can be paid using life insurance benefits. According to
   More, many wealthy members set up a trust so they have a nest egg if
   and when they wake up.

Live for ever: Scientists say they’ll soon extend life ‘well beyond 120’
Ernestine Shepherd

   In Palo Alto in the heart of Silicon Valley, hedge fund manager Joon
   Yun is doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation. According to US social
   security data, he says, the probability of a 25-year-old dying before
   their 26th birthday is 0.1%. If we could keep that risk constant
   throughout life instead of it rising due to age-related disease, the
   average person would – statistically speaking – live 1,000 years. Yun
   finds the prospect tantalising and even believable. Late last year he
   launched a $1m prize challenging scientists to “hack the code of life”
   and push human lifespan past its apparent maximum of about 120 years
   (the longest known/confirmed lifespan was 122 years).

After the last death: Doctors, academics debate the possibility, value of a
150-year lifespan

   Longevity Prize and President of Palo Alto Investors, LLC. Photo by
   Veronica Weber.

   Halloween was approaching and Dr. Joon Yun was explaining why he wanted
   someone to hack our bodies.

   “Every day 150,000 people die worldwide and the majority of them (are)
   due to age-related illness,” Yun, 46, said while seated in the board
   room of Palo Alto Investors LLC, an investment management company of
   which he is president. “We’ve got the technology to hack the aging code
   and end aging. Question is not ‘if’ but ‘when’ we want it to happen.”

   Yun, a bespectacled physician turned investor, is the benefactor of The
   Palo Alto Longevity Prize, a $1 million science competition aiming to
   end aging by restoring the body’s homeostatic capacity and promoting
   the extension of a sustained and healthy lifespan.

   The Prize is the latest in a spate of anti-aging efforts being mounted
   throughout the Bay Area. Google’s Calico Project has gained the most
   attention because of the corporate brand and the impenetrable secrecy
   surrounding it. The Buck Institute in Marin County was featured in The
   Atlantic’s October cover story “What Happens When We All Live to 100?”

   The same issue featured an essay by Ezekiel Emanuel, “Why I Hope to Die
   at 75.” Emanuel dismisses efforts to extend healthy longevity and
   equates age with decrepitude, an attitude that longevity experts
   including Yun consider laughably outdated.

   “I’ve gotten so many emails from people linking to the story,” Yun
   groaned. “Somebody should start a new magazine called The Pacific. The
   Atlantic is an old way to think of things. Look west; look to the
   future.”

   Six teams of scientists and medical researchers from around the country
   are competing for the Longevity Prize’s two $500,000 awards, the
   Homeostatic Capacity Prize and the Longevity Demonstration Prize. The
   former will go to the first team to demonstrate that it can restore
   homeostatic capacity of an aging mammal to that of a young adult. The
   latter will go to the first team that can extend the lifespan of its
   mammal by 50 percent of acceptable published norms using an approach
   that restores homeostatic capacity.

   Homeostatic capacity refers to the ability of one’s physiology to
   self-correct and stabilize in response to stressors. Young people
   typically have a strong homeostatic capacity; it’s what allows their
   bodies to heal from injuries and recover quickly from illnesses.

Miljonjakten som ska stoppa åldrandet

   En miljon dollar för att knäcka åldrandet. Det – och förhoppningsvis
   ett längre liv – är vad som står på spel när forskarlag världen över
   tävlar om Palo Alto Longevity Prize. SvD träffade människorna som söker
   efter ungdomens källa.

   För Jin Hyung Lee och hennes team är tävlingen framförallt en chans att
   testa hypoteser och utbyta kunskap med forskare från andra
   expertområden. Här i hennes labb vid Stanford university i
   Kalifornien. FOTO: PAUL SAKUMA

   Doktor Joon Yuns svärfar blev bara 68 år gammal. Det var ett av skälen
   till att den före detta Standfordläkaren, nu investerare, bestämde sig
   för att ta upp kampen mot döden. I början var han skeptisk till att det
   kunde göras, men efter att ha pratat med vänner och experter började
   han bli alltmer övertygad om att åldrandet faktiskt kan stoppas.

   – Det är inte så långt bort som folk tror. Vad folk vet om dagens
   forskning är bara toppen på isberget, säger Yun, vars pappa arbetat med
   hälsofrågor vid Världsbanken.

   “Vem vill inte leva längre?”

   Jin Hyung Lee

   Vi befinner oss på Palo Alto Investors kontor, söder om San Francisco.
   Ordförande Joon Yun konstaterar att hälsovården är fantastisk, men att
   den har två allvarliga problem; genom att bota symptom av åldrande, men
   inte åldrandet i sig, bildas en ond spiral – med en åldrande befolkning
   som behöver alltmer sjukvård ju äldre den blir. Det andra fatala felet
   är att alla till slut åldras och dör.

   – Vad skulle hända om vi i stället återställde kroppen till var den en
   gång var i ungdomen?

   Idén om ett pris för att motivera forskare att ”hacka åldrandets kod
   och bota åldrande” kom från familjens Yuns barnflicka, en bekant till
   Googles styrelseordförande Eric Schmidt. I september presenterades Palo
   Alto Longevity Prize. Tävlingen består av två deltävlingar med en halv
   miljon dollar i prispotten vardera. I den ena – med deadline juni 2016
   – gäller det att återskapa en ungdomlig rytm hos ett åldrande
   däggdjurshjärta. Det andra går ut på att med bibehållen biologiskt
   jämvikt (homeostas) förlänga livslängden hos ett däggdjur med 50
   procent före september 2018.

   Hittills har ett tiotal forskarlag anmält sig. Först att anta
   utmaningen var ett team från Stanford, lett av forskaren Jin Hyung Lee.
   Grupperna arbetar med olika tekniker som stamceller, gener, hormoner
   och elektriska impulser. Lees labb forskar på nervbanor i hjärnan och
   hur de kontrollerar olika system i kroppen.

   – Vi hade egentligen inte funderat på kopplingarna till livslängd, men
   kände att vi hade verktygen och att vi kanske skulle kunna bidra, säger
   hon.

   Den största utmaningen är att bedriva forskningen utan bidrag, vid
   sidan av det vanliga arbetet.

   – Främst gör vi det här för att vi är intresserade av ämnet. Vem vill
   inte leva längre?

   Gerontologen Aubrey de Grey har skrivit boken ”Ending Aging” och är en
   av priskommitténs rådgivare. Positivt med priset menar han är att det
   syftar till att reversera åldrande, snarare än bara bromsa det.

   ”Alldeles för lite forskning görs på föryngring, så det här kommer göra
   väldigt stor skillnad”, skriver han i ett mejl till SvD.

   Aubrey de Grey hör till dem som tror att det är möjligt för människor
   att leva i tusen år eller mer. För honom och andra är det inte en fråga
   om ”om”, utan ”när” vår livslängd kommer öka dramatiskt.

   – Människor kommer aldrig bli odödliga. Däremot är det sannolikt att vi
   kommer leva mycket, mycket längre och friskare liv i framtiden, säger
   ytterligare en av rådgivarna, Sonia Arrison.

   Hon är författare till boken ”100+”, om vilka effekter en ökad mänsklig
   livslängd skulle få. Oavsett problemen som kan uppstå
   (befolkningsökning som ett givet exempel) anser hon att fördelarna
   överväger – ”om det står mellan döden eller några problem på vägen tar
   jag hellre problemen.”

   Enligt Arrison befinner vi oss vid en väldigt speciell tidpunkt i
   historien. För första gången har vi verktygen att reparera oss själva,
   nu måste vi bara lära oss att använda dem.

   – Folk inser inte att det är en revolution på gång och att det kan gå
   snabbare om alla ligger på. Jag är inte orolig över att tekniken inte
   kommer finnas tillgänglig för mina barn, men jag skulle gärna vilja
   finnas kvar för att umgås med dem.

   Även om priset siktar högt är Yun medveten om att han kanske kommer att
   behöva skriva fler checkar för att nå sitt mål. Matematikern och
   ekonomen Eric Weinstein, vd för Facebook-miljardären Peter Theils
   investmentbolag Thiel Capital, var en av talarna när priset
   presenterades. Han hoppas att tävlingen inte minst kan bli ett viktigt
   steg på vägen.

   – Kanske kan den första omgången ge oss en tydligare bild av hur vår
   motståndare ser ut.

   Dr Yun nickar instämmande. Chanserna för en ”grand slam” på första
   försöket är små. Han tror ändå att vi befinner oss vid starten på något
   stort.

   – Kanske kommer framtida generationer se tillbaka på oss som de sista
   människorna som var fast i en åldrande kropp.

The Palo Alto Prize: A ‘Moonshot’ at Increasing Longevity

   Posted on November 23, 2014 by VICTORIA THORP

   Tucked behind an unassuming door on University Avenue is the center of
   an effort that could significantly impact the life healthspan of human
   beings in the years to come. If that sounds hard to believe, then you
   haven’t met Dr. Joon Yun, the persuasive founder of the Palo Alto
   Longevity Prize, who aims to enlist the brightest scientific minds in
   the world to address the fundamental question of how to prevent aging.

   joon-yu_forbes

   Magazine

   Joon, a board certified radiologist who served on the clinical faculty
   of Stanford Hospital and has an M.D. from Duke University and an B.A.
   Harvard University, is president of Palo Alto Investors LLC, an
   investment management firm with over $1 billion invested in healthcare.

   But beyond his credentials, Joon is a classic visionary who believes
   that the inexorable march towards old age, with all of its accompanying
   aches, pains and fatigue, is preventable. “My father was a leader in
   health care research for the World Bank and taught us the importance of
   community,” Joon explains. “We are calling this effort the Palo Alto
   Prize because Palo Alto has become an epicenter of global technology
   revolutions.”

   homeostasis-300x209

   What does it take to help the human body regain homeostasis?

   The key to longevity, he says, is for human beings to maintain the
   homeostatic capacity of a young adult even as they age. Homeostatic
   capacity is the ability to maintain homeostasis, which is defined as
   “the tendency of a system, especially the physiological system of
   higher animals, to maintain internal stability.” While homeostatic
   capacity is robust in our youth, we start to lose it as we get older,
   with particular decline in midlife. Anyone 40 or over who has tried to
   recover from an injury (or even a hangover) will relate to the how
   difficult it is to regain ‘internal stability’ in middle age compared
   to younger years. And the challenge of maintaining homeostasis
   increases as the years pile on.

   To explore this idea, Joon conceived of an incentive prize like the X
   Prize, which would set an audacious goal and encourage the world’s
   smartest researchers to compete for a reward. He put up $1 million of
   his own money and enlisted Keith Powers, the former head of strategy
   for the X Prize Foundation, to help shape the incentives for drawing
   the teams of researchers to the Palo Alto Prize.

   While $1 million might seem small in an area where start up companies
   are routinely valued upwards of $100 million, Powers explains in a
   video on the Palo Alto Prize website that the motivation of the
   scientific community is very different from Silicon Valley.
   “[Scientists] want to move discovery forward…for them, the money is not
   the goal but instead it provides a path to get there.”

   And as evidence that the award amount is sufficient, when Joon started
   contacting leading scientists about the Palo Alto Prize in June of
   2014, they leaped at the opportunity to get involved. There are now 14
   teams from across the United States and Europe (including one led by
   Dr. Dr. Jin Hyung Lee at Stanford University), which are each
   approaching the question of how to help bodies maintain homeostasis
   from different disciplines, including bioengineering, genetics,
   neurology and more. View videos about the teams here.

   the Palo Alto Prize

   Dr. David Mendelowitz, a professor of Pharmacology and Physiology who
   is leading a Palo Alto Prize team at George Washington University
   explains the appeal of the prize, saying, “As scientists, we like a
   challenge and the Palo Alto Prize is a catalyst for new work and new
   hypotheses of learning.”

   In many ways, the Palo Alto Prize is in its infancy and the real news
   will unfold in September 2018 when the prize ends and Joon and his team
   of advisors, experts in medicine, biotech and venture capital evaluate
   the ideas that emerge. Joon has committed to provide additional prize
   incentives to continue the work past 2018 if there are promising
   avenues of research in longevity to pursue. He also lauds the efforts
   of Calico, the company started by Google to explore longevity, as it
   only helps the pursuit of knowledge to have many minds engaged.

   What about the potential environmental issues on a planet where people
   routinely live 100 years or more? Joon is less worried. “Population
   studies show that when longevity goes up, so do education levels and
   income,” he says. “Plus if people begin living longer, they will care
   more about what the world will look like in the future – impact
   concerns will shift from being their children’s problem to being their

   Can the Palo Alto Prize find the key to extending healthy life?

   As to the fundamental question of whether it is in fact possible to
   prevent aging and restore homeostatic capacity, Joon compares the
   effort to President Kennedy’s goal of reaching the moon just 64 years
   after the Wright Brothers manned the first aircraft. “We have mapped
   the human genome but we are still in the early stage of understanding
   what this step could mean for medical research,” Joon says. “With all
   the breakthroughs we’ve had in science, there is no question that we
   can solve the longevity issue. We see the Palo Alto Prize as just a way
   to speed up the process. It will happen- it’s just a race against
   time.”
