What's nPerf speed test ? How does it work ?

   nPerf qualify accurately your internet connection's performances.

   This speed test relies on an exclusive algorithm allowing you to
   measure accurately download bitrate, upload bitrate and latency of your
   connection.
   nPerf uses a worldwide dedicated servers network, which is optimized to
   deliver enough bitrate to saturate your connection, so that we can
   measure its bitrate accurately.
   nPerf speed test is compatible with all broadband and mobile
   connections: ADSL, VDSL, cable, optical fiber FTTH / FTTB, satellite,
   wifi, wimax, cellular 2G / 3G / 4G (LTE), 5G.
   The nPerf speed test has been designed by telecom enthusiasts to enable
   you to accurately measure the speed of your Internet connection easily,
   in only one click! Oh... and this speed test is absolutely free of ads!
   Enjoy it ... and if you like it, spread the word :)

   Latency (ping)
   Indicates the delay a small packet of data requires to make a
   round-trip from your computer to the nPerf server. The shorter the
   delay, the most reactive is your connection.

   Download bitrate
   Indicates the amount of data your connection can receive in one second
   from the nPerf server. The highest the measured value, the best is the
   bitrate of your connection.

   Upload bitrate
   Indicates the amount of data your connection can send in one second to
   the nPerf server. The highest the measured value, the best is the
   bitrate of your connection.
