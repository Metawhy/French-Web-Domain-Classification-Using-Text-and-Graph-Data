Thanksgiving Fun


    Holly and I have really enjoyed making close reads for our kids. We
   use these as our text for reading and writing in addition to trade
   books and internet research. We give the kids highlighters and as they
   read, we ask the questions that correspond to each number. They
   highlight the answers. The kids really like this method. Click the pix
   to download a copy to try!

   Turkey Trot



   My intervention segment  focuses on math remediation for a small group
   of students. They love this game! They play over and over. I change the
   graphics and problems. Students roll a die, move spaces and answer the
   question. They mark off the candy corn with the answer. If they land on
   a corn, they can pick any number to cross off. The winner is the LAST
   person to color in an answer. This keeps them all in the game to the
   end. I love the plastic pockets from Target's dollar rack. They use a
   dry erase marker to mark off. Click the pix for a download!
   My Cute Graphics.com is a great place to find free graphics....
