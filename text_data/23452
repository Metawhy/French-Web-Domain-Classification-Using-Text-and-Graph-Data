   With the deadly human cost of climate change now staring world leaders
   in the face, could we finally be reaching a tipping point?

   It has taken hundreds of heat-related deaths across the northern
   hemisphere for climate change to make global headlines.

   In Japan, at least 80 people have died and thousands have been
   hospitalized as a result of the heatwave, while scorching temperatures
   in Canada have killed an estimated 90 people. Wildfires caused by
   drought and extreme heat have also been deadly, killing 91 people in
   Greece alone. Horrifying images from a coastal town near Athens showed
   burned-out cars lining the roads, abandoned by drivers who had fled
   into the sea.

   These were not the first deaths linked to climate change, and they
   won’t be the last. In Bangladesh hundreds of people die each year in
   floods which will become increasingly frequent and severe as sea levels
   rise and Himalayan glaciers melt. People die on a regular basis from
   famine, malnutrition and water-borne diseases as climate change
   intensifies droughts across sub-Saharan Africa.

   Yet if you search online for “climate change deaths Africa”, the top
   results are articles about the demise of the Baobab tree. For too long,
   wealthy leaders haven’t considered the human impact of climate change
   in hotter, poorer countries worth acting on.

   There is an urgent need to put people and human rights at the centre of
   the climate change conversation. For Amnesty International and other
   human rights organizations, this means pushing for accountability for
   states who fail to act on climate change, just as we do with other
   human rights violations.

   Governments’ responsibilities in relation to climate change were
   specified by the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep the global
   temperature rise well below two degrees. But governments also have
   human rights obligations. This means that those who fail to do
   everything in their power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help
   affected people adapt to climate change are breaching international
   human rights law.

   So, for example, while President Trump may have pulled the US out of
   the Paris Agreement, the US is still bound by its international
   obligations to protect human rights which are threatened by climate
   change - like the rights to life, water and sanitation, food, health
   and housing. To comply with these obligations states need to, at the
   very least, move away from the extraction, production and export of
   fossil fuels, phase out government subsidies for these fuels and invest
   in renewable energy.

   Protecting human rights and protecting the planet are two parts of the
   same fight. Climate change will exacerbate existing inequalities, and
   those who are already the most marginalized will suffer the most as a
   result of dwindling resources. For example, rural women, who form the
   majority of self-employed, small-scale farmers, will be most affected
   by climate shocks like droughts, floods and crop failures due to gender
   and power imbalances.

   More and more people will be forced out of their homes when they become
   uninhabitable, exposed to all the risks that displacement entails. Many
   wealthy countries have closed their doors to refugees in recent years,
   and we cannot rely on these same leaders to act wisely or humanely when
   the number of people on the move increases due to climate change.

   Inequality between nations will also increase, and climate change
   threatens to undo many of the momentous human rights gains of the
   twentieth century. Former colonised nations like Bangladesh, Haiti and
   the Philippines are predicted to be some of the hardest hit by climate
   change.

   These countries, impoverished in part by years of colonial rule, are
   less equipped to respond and adapt to climate disasters, despite having
   contributed far less to the damage than richer countries in the global
   north. The struggles for independence which defined so much of the past
   century will mean little for former colonies if large parts of them
   become uninhabitable. In this way, rising seas and desertification
   threaten to wipe out history as well as habitats.

   Governments are putting all of this at risk in order to protect
   corporate interests and to avoid relatively modest amounts of
   investments - approximately 1 percent of global GDP a year - that could
   dramatically reduce carbon emissions, avert catastrophic losses and
   avoid consequent greater costs. Taken together, the commitments
   governments have made to implement the Paris Agreement, would still
   result in a global temperature rise of 3-4 °C.

   Amnesty International has for years worked alongside communities who
   have been affected by corporate created environmental disasters, like
   the Bhopal gas leak and oil spills in the Niger Delta. These incidents
   often affect poor or rural communities, and for too long reckless
   companies and complacent governments have operated with an “out of
   sight, out of mind” mentality.

   But this devastating heatwave has made it increasingly clear to
   governments worldwide that the impacts of climate change and
   environmental degradation will affect everybody - including their
   voters. With the deadly human cost of climate change now staring
   sceptical, apathetic world leaders in the face, could we finally be
   reaching a tipping point?
