Privacy Policy

   Last updated: April 2018

   About Cartier and this Privacy Policy

   Cartier SA has its registered offices at Rue André-De-Garrini 3, 1217
   Meyrin, Switzerland. In this Privacy Policy, we use the term Cartier
   (and "we", "us" and "our") to refer to the head office of Cartier SA at
   the registered address above, our affiliates and our boutiques.

   Please take a moment to read the following policy that explains how we
   collect, use, disclose and transfer the personal information that you
   provide to us on our websites, mobile applications and other digital
   platforms (together referred to as the “Platforms”), when you visit a
   Cartier boutique, contact the Cartier Ambassador by telephone, or when
   you interact with us over social media platforms. It also explains how
   we collect information through the use of cookies and related
   technologies when you use our Platforms.

   Where we offer our products for sale online or by phone through the
   Cartier Client Relations Center, you must read the applicable
   Conditions of Sale, which will govern the terms and conditions of any
   such purchases made in this way.

   Updates to this Privacy Policy

   From time to time we may update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we
   will publish the changes on this Platform.

   Information you provide to us and how we use it

   We collect the information from you as detailed below:
     * To access certain areas of our Platform, you will need to register
       with us. During the registration process you will be asked to
       submit personal information about yourself (including your name and
       address, date of birth, e-mail address and telephone number).  By
       entering your details in the fields requested, you enable Cartier
       to provide you with the services you select;
     * When you purchase products online or by phone, we collect
       information such as your purchase details and relevant payment
       information.  In addition, we will also collect personal
       information from you when you correspond with us (for example, if
       you contact us with a query about one of our products or services),
       when you provide your details when you visit a Cartier boutique or
       contact the Cartier Ambassador by telephone. Please note that phone
       calls will on occasion be recorded for security, training and
       development purposes;
     * If you choose to interact with Cartier via a social media platform
       or other third party service, we will collect the information you
       have provided to us through that platform;
     * We also collect certain information automatically about visitors to
       our Platform, described in the section headed "Cookies and other
       information that we automatically collect", below; and
     * We will collect information about your location to the extent that
       we provide any location services, described in the section headed
       “Location services” below.

   We will use the information we collect from you to:
     * Manage and fulfil purchase and repair orders, facilitate delivery,
       and to provide after service care;
     * Manage our accounts and records;
     * Assist with your inquiries and requests;
     * Send service related communications, including announcements and
       administrative messages such as order confirmation;
     * Identify products and services we think you might be interested in
       based on your information, such as your purchase history and your
       previous interactions with us;
     * Send you marketing communications (including e-mails and social
       media audience matching) relating to us and other third party
       partners and that we think may be of interest to you where we have
       a legitimate basis to do so and in accordance with your
       communication preferences (please see the “Your choices” section
       below for further information about how you can control these
       updates);
     * Conduct market research so that we can continuously improve the
       services we provide to our customers;
     * Undertake credit checking, prevention of fraud and other prohibited
       or illegal activities as part of our efforts to keep our Platform
       and services secure; and
     * Understand how our Platform is used so that we can continuously
       improve our Platform and services and other offerings.

   Cookies and other information that we automatically collect

   Like most platforms, Cartier logs IP addresses and uses cookies and
   similar technologies that allow us to recognize you and to customize
   your experience, and provide us with information about the way our
   visitors access our Platform. You can find out more about how we use
   cookies and related technologies below.

   What is a cookie?

   Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which
   are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a
   website or mobile application. They are used to recognize your computer
   as you move between pages on a website, or when you return to a website
   or mobile application you have visited previously. Cookies are widely
   used in order to make platforms work, or to work more efficiently, as
   well as to provide information to the owners of the platform.

   We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for
   example, by remembering your language and/or product preferences) and
   to better understand how our Platform is used. Cookies will tell us,
   for example, whether you have visited our Platform before or whether
   you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you
   see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

   There are two broad categories of cookies:
     * First party cookies, served directly by Cartier to your computer or
       mobile device. They are used only by Cartier to recognize your
       computer or mobile device when it revisits our Platform.
     * Third party cookies, which are served by a third party service
       provider on our Platform, and can be used by the service provider
       to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other
       platforms. Third party cookies are most commonly used for platform
       analytics or advertising purposes.

   Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different
   periods of time. Cartier uses both 'session cookies' and ‘permanent
   cookies’. Session cookies exist only while your browser is open and are
   deleted automatically once you close your browser. Permanent cookies
   survive after your browser is closed, and can be used to recognize your
   computer or mobile device when you open your browser and browse the
   internet again.

   What cookies does Cartier use?

   The Platform serves only the following types of cookies to your
   computer or mobile device:

   Type of Cookie

   Purpose

   Cookies necessary for essential purposes

   These cookies are essential to provide you with services available
   through this Platform and to use some of its features, such as access
   to secure areas. Without these cookies, services you have asked for,
   like transactional pages and secure login accounts, would not be
   possible.

   Functionality Cookies

   These cookies serve a variety of purposes related to the presentation,
   performance and functionality of this Platform. Their overall purpose,
   however, is to enhance visitors’ experience and enjoyment of this
   Platform.

   For example, some of these cookies enable visitors to specify language,
   product or other platform preferences.

   Analytical Cookies

   These cookies are used to collect information about how visitors use
   our Platform.

   The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor and
   is aggregated. It includes the number of visitors to our Platform, the
   platforms that referred them to our Platform and the pages that they
   visited on our Platform.

   We use this information to help run our Platform more efficiently, to
   gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of
   activity on our Platform.

   Advertising Cookies

   When you visit our Platform or click on advertisements or promotional
   areas on the Platform these cookies are used to deliver adverts more
   relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
   number of times you see an advertisement as well as help to evaluate
   the effectiveness of advertising and promotion.

   They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission.
   They remember that you have visited a platform and this information is
   shared with other organizations such as advertisers.

   Social Cookies

   These cookies enable users to share pages and content through third
   party social media and other platforms. The companies that serve these
   cookies may also use your information to serve targeted advertising on
   other platforms.

   How to control or delete cookies

   We use non-essential cookies on the basis of your consent. You have the
   right withdraw that consent and refuse the use of cookies at any time
   and we have explained how you can exercise this right below. However,
   please note that if you choose to refuse cookies you may not be able to
   use the full functionality of our Platform.

   You can set your cookie preferences by changing your browser settings
   so that cookies from this Platform cannot be placed on your computer or
   mobile device. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by
   your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit”
   facility).

   If you would like to learn more, please visit
   http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. More detail on how businesses use
   cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.  We are not
   responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’
   opt-out options.

   IP addresses

   We will collect information about your computer or mobile device,
   including where available your IP address, operating system, log-in
   times and browser type. We use this information to better understand
   how visitors use our Platform and for internal reporting purposes. We
   will anonymize and share this information with advertisers, sponsors or
   other businesses.

   About Advertising

   The Platforms use third parties such as network advertisers and ad
   exchanges to serve you ads on third party platforms after you leave our
   Platforms, and we use third party analytics and other service providers
   to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about
   the use of the Platforms and viewing of ads and of our content. Network
   advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which are
   based on your visits to the Platforms and other apps and sites you have
   visited. Third party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to
   you for products and services that you might be interested in.

   Third party tracking technologies are not controlled by us, even if
   they are associated with our Platforms or our ads. Statements regarding
   our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information
   used by these third parties and others or the use of the information
   that such third parties collect.  The relevant third party’s terms of
   service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be
   reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We
   make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third
   party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third
   parties.

   You have choices in respect of the delivery of ads. You can opt-out of
   receiving certain types of behavioural ads by visiting the third party
   websites described in the section headed “How to control or delete
   cookies” above. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or
   compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.

   Location services

   Some of the services that we provide are able to use information about
   your location. For these services, which are typically available on
   mobile devices or applications, you are provided with the opportunity
   to provide your consent to the use of location services, which, for
   example, process information deriving from GPS, sensors, beacons or
   Wi-Fi access points in order to allow you to benefit from a more
   personalized service. Your device will have settings that allow you to
   turn off these services should you no longer wish to benefit from them.

   Sharing your information

   We do not share personal information about you with other people or
   non-affiliated companies except under the following circumstances:
     * we will disclose your personal information to third party providers
       for the purposes of providing online and other payment services,
       handling credit checks and fraud prevention, and any other services
       required in order for us to use your information for the purposes
       specified in the section entitled “Information you provide us and
       how we use it”;
     * we will disclose your personal information to any law enforcement
       agency, court, regulator, government authority or other third party
       where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or
       regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the
       rights of any third party;  and
     * we will disclose your personal information to any third party that
       purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our
       assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will
       use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we
       transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is
       consistent with this Privacy Policy.

   International transfers

   Information we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in
   any country or territory where one or more of our affiliated group
   companies or third party service providers are located or maintain
   facilities. Some of these third parties will use cloud-based storage
   solutions. While other territories may not have the same standards of
   data protection as those within your home country, we will continue to
   protect the personal information we transfer in accordance with this
   Privacy Policy.

   Protecting your information

   We want you to feel confident about using our Platform, and we are
   committed to protecting the personal information we collect. We limit
   access to personal information about you to employees who reasonably
   need access to it, to provide products or services to you or in order
   to do their jobs. We have appropriate technical and organizational
   physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the personal
   information that you provide to us against unauthorized or unlawful
   processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. However,
   where we ask you to choose a password in order to access certain parts
   of our Platform, you are responsible for selecting a secure password
   and keeping that password confidential. You should choose a password
   which you do not use on any other site, and you should not share it
   with anyone else.

   Your choices

   You have the right to ask for access to any personal information that
   we hold about you in our records, to correct any inaccuracies and to
   update any out-of-date information. In some circumstances, you have the
   right to request the erasure of your personal information or a
   restriction of its use.

   You have the right to object to us processing your personal information
   in some cases. In particular, you can ask us to stop sending you direct
   marketing communications at any time (however please note that we may
   continue to send you service-related (i.e. non-marketing)
   communications, such as e-mail updates on your order status). If you
   wish to exercise any of these rights, please write to us at the address
   listed below.

   You may unsubscribe from e-mail marketing communications at any time by

   name www.ca.cartier.com (the “Platform”) or by phone (1.855.888.8798)
   via the client relations center of Cartier (the “Client Relations
   Center”).

   These Conditions of Sale apply only to sales made through the Client
   Relations Center or the Platform by individuals who are residents in
   Canada at the time of placing the order. The Conditions of Sale
   applicable to any order placed through the Client Relations Center or
   the Platform are those in force at the time that an order has been
   placed on your behalf by a Cartier Ambassador (in the case of an order
   placed through the Client Relations Center) or at the time you place
   your order (in the case of an order placed through the Platform). In
   the case of an order placed through the Platform, when you check the “I
   have read and I accept the Conditions of Sale” box at the payment
   section of the Platform before placing your order with Cartier, you
   indicate your acceptance of these Conditions of Sale. If you refuse to
   accept these Conditions of Sale, you will not be able to order any
   Cartier products from the Platform or the Client Relations Center.
   Sales conducted through Cartier retail boutiques and/or authorized
   retailers are not subject to these Conditions of Sale.

   Please read the Conditions of Sale and check our Platform on a regular
   basis to be informed of any changes. Cartier may modify the Conditions
   of Sale from time to time, at its sole discretion, and your continued
   use and/or registration following such change will signify your
   agreement to be bound in the future by the modified Conditions of Sale.
   If you are placing an order through the Platform, then by checking the
   “I have read and I accept the Conditions of Sale” box and placing your
   order, you will be indicating your agreement to be bound by the
   Conditions of Sale as so modified through such time. Persons wishing to
   use the Client Relations Center or the Platform will also be deemed, by
   virtue of such use, to have agreed to be bound by our Platform Terms of
   Use and our Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into these
   Conditions of Sale by reference. Customers using the Client Relations
   Center will be provided with access to our Privacy Policy as set forth
   in “Acknowledgment of Order” below. If you do not agree to any change
   to the Conditions of Sale, then you must immediately contact the Client
   Relations Center to cancel your registration and refrain from ordering
   any Cartier product through the Client Relations Center or the
   Platform.

   2. Purchasing eligibility

   Only individuals (and not legal entities) who (a) have reached the age
   of majority (eighteen in most provinces of Canada), and (b) have legal
   capacity to enter into contracts and (c) reside in Canada at the time
   of purchase may order products through the Client Relations Center or
   on the Platform. If you are under the age of majority or otherwise
   cannot lawfully enter into a contract, you must have your parent or
   guardian place an order on your behalf and thereby assent to these
   Conditions of Sale. Any orders placed in violation of this provision
   shall be null and void.

   By placing an order through the Client Relations Center or on the
   Platform, you represent and warrant that you are a bona fide end-user
   customer and will not deliver, sell or otherwise distribute Cartier
   products or purchase Cartier products for commercial purposes or any
   other commercial benefit. If Cartier believes, in its sole discretion,
   that an order would violate the terms of the preceding sentence or that
   the Customer is engaging in fraudulent or grey market activities, then
   Cartier may refuse such order.

   Moreover, in the event that Cartier reasonably suspects that a third
   party has breached a customer’s registration, password and/or account
   login, Cartier shall immediately cancel and terminate the account.

   3. Product availability; quantity

   All orders placed through on the Platform are subject to availability
   and acceptance by Cartier.

   Cartier reserves the right to change the assortment of items offered on
   the Platform or through the Client Relations Center, and may limit from
   time to time the quantity of Cartier products that may be ordered by a
   Customer in a single buying session and to refuse orders that exceed
   authorized product quantity limits, without prior notice. Currently,
   orders may not exceed five (5) products in any buying session on the
   Platform or through the Client Relations Center.

   The Client Relations Center and the product pages on the Platform can
   provide you with information regarding products that are currently
   available for sale through those channels. Please note that only
   merchandise displaying an “Add to Shopping Bag” message is available
   for sale through the Platform. You may also call the Cartier Client
   Relations Center (1.855.888.8798) and a Cartier Ambassador will provide
   you with further information as to product availability and assist you
   with your purchase.

   4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION; PERSONAL INFORMATION; GUEST CHECKOUT

   In order to place an order on the Platform, you or the Cartier
   Ambassador (on your behalf) may either register and create an online
   account on the Platform, or place an order as a guest without creating
   an online account by selecting the "Guest Checkout" option. In order to
   create this account, you will be required to provide valid and
   up-to-date personal information, such as your name, phone number and
   e-mail address, and to confirm that you have reached the age of
   majority.

   Upon completion of your account registration on the Platform or by the
   Cartier Ambassador, you will receive by e-mail a one-time password,
   which will allow you to log in to your account on the Platform and
   create a permanent account login and password. You will also receive a
   second e-mail summarizing the personal information you provided in
   registering for your online account. You are responsible for ensuring
   that your password and account login are kept secret, safe and secure
   at all times. Cartier will not be held responsible or liable for any
   misuse of your account in connection with, and/or resulting from, a
   third party’s access to and use of your password and account login.

   We may change the information required to place an order or the
   registration requirements from time to time. Any changes will be posted
   on the Website. Please refer to our Privacy Policy and Clause 7 of
   these Conditions of Sale for more details about how we may use your
   personal information.

   When placing an order on the Platform you will be required to provide
   other personal information as applicable, such as shipping address,
   billing address and payment details. Additional information may be
   collected by Cartier or its third party providers at this time for
   security and anti-fraud purposes.

   You represent and warrant that the personal information you provide to
   the Client Relations Center or via the Platform is true, valid,
   complete and up-to-date in all respects, and you confirm that you are
   the person referred to in the shipping (unless the item is a gift) and
   billing information provided.

   Should any of the information you provide to the Client Relations
   Center or on the Platform change, please log in to your account and
   update such information directly on the Platform, inform the Client
   Relations Center or notify Cartier at the following e-mail address:
   contact.ca@cartier.com or as set out in our Privacy Policy.

   5. ORDERS

   If you are ordering on the Platform, orders will be processed as
   follows: Once you have chosen a product, you may place this product in
   your shopping bag. You may then decide to continue shopping for other
   products and add them to your shopping bag (subject to availability and
   quantity limits) or proceed to “Checkout”. You may also remove one or
   several products you have selected from the Shopping Bag. Once on the
   payment page, review your order details and personal information
   (including e-mail, shipping address, billing address and payment
   information), check the box next to “I have read and I accept the
   Conditions of Sale”. Then, place your order.

   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for herein, Cartier
   reserves the right to refuse, cancel and terminate orders at any moment
   in time. For example, Cartier may refuse, terminate or cancel your
   order if there is an ongoing dispute concerning payment of a prior
   order or if Cartier suspects, in its sole discretion, that you have
   engaged in fraudulent or grey market activities or have otherwise
   violated these Conditions of Sale.

   6. Prices, tax and shipping costs

   All prices shown on the product pages of the Platform or quoted by the
   Client Relations Center are in Canadian Dollars.

   Cartier reserves the right to modify prices and delivery costs at any
   time without prior notice.

   Actual shipping costs and applicable taxes will be reflected on your
   payment page before you are asked to confirm and place your order (in
   the case of a Platform order) and will also be reflected in the
   Confirmation of Order. Delivery costs, if any, are described in the
   shipping policy set forth below. Sales and use taxes will vary based on
   the location to which products are being shipped. Delivery costs and
   estimated taxes are not stated on the product pages but will be added
   to the product price, if applicable, after you have chosen your
   delivery location and options.

   Please note that changes to applicable law between the date your
   order is placed and the date you are sent a Confirmation of Order may
   result in changes to the sales tax associated with your purchase. If
   the resulting change is an increase in the sales tax you are charged,
   we will contact you and ask that you reconfirm your purchase.

   7. PAYMENT BY CREDIT CARD

   Cartier accepts the following credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, American
   Express, and Discover.

   When ordering on the Platform, you will need to enter your payment
   details on the appropriate form. In the case of an order placed by
   telephone, you will need to communicate to the Client Relations Center
   your credit/debit card number and your three- or four- digit security
   code that is printed on the back or the front of your card
   (CVV2/CVC2/CID). Your telephone conversation will be recorded for
   security and quality control purposes. Any telephone conversation
   recorded by our Client Relations Center that contains your credit card
   information will be fully encrypted and only used to process card
   transactions.

   All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and
   authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card
   refuses to authorize payment to Cartier, you will need to contact your
   card issuer directly to solve this problem, and Cartier will not be
   liable for any delay or non-delivery.

   In order to process your order, we may perform security checks on your
   credit card. The full amount of your purchase will be blocked on your
   credit card until your order is approved by Cartier, and your credit
   card will be charged the applicable purchase price once your order has
   shipped. By submitting an offer to purchase Cartier products on the
   Platform or through the Client Relations Center, you expressly
   authorize Cartier to perform security checks, where Cartier deems
   necessary, to transmit or to obtain information (including any updated
   information) about you to or from third parties from time to time,
   including but not limited to your credit-card number, to authenticate
   your identity, to validate your credit card, to obtain an initial
   credit card authorization and to authorize individual purchase
   transactions.

   Cartier takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and
   physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against
   loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access,
   disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Cartier uses Secure Sockets
   Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is
   collected. Unfortunately, transmitting information over the Internet is
   not completely secure. Although we implement appropriate measures to
   protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
   the data you transmit; any transmission is at your own risk and we
   cannot be held liable. For more information about how we use and
   protect your information please view our Privacy Policy.

   Cartier is prohibited from making sales of its goods to certain
   designated persons (“Designated Persons”) under Canadian anti-terrorist
   financing, criminal and other laws or to countries sanctioned by
   Canada. In addition, Cartier may be prohibited under U.S. law from
   making sales of its goods to individuals or entities designated on the
   Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) Specially Designated
   Nationals (“SDN”) List, or to country destinations sanctioned by the
   U.S. Cartier will review transactions against lists of Designated
   Persons, SDNs and countries sanctioned by Canada and the U.S. Any such
   transactions will be declined.

   8. PAYMENT BY PAYPAL

   You may also pay by using PayPal, as indicated on the Platform.

   9. REVIEW AND CONFIRMATION

   You should carefully check and confirm all details on the payment page
   before placing your order through the Platform, including without
   limitation the particulars of each sale. In the case of an order being
   placed through the Client Relations Center, the Cartier Ambassador may
   verbally ask you to confirm the details of your order.

   10. Acknowledgment of order

   Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed on the
   Platform, you will receive an Acknowledgment of Order by e-mail
   acknowledging the details of your order. This Acknowledgment of Order
   will contain an Order Reference Number assigned by Cartier. Please make
   sure that you save this Order Reference Number for any future enquiries
   regarding your order. This Acknowledgment of Order is not an acceptance
   of your order. Following the transmission of the Acknowledgment of
   Order, Cartier will conduct its usual credit, anti-fraud, security and
   related legal checks and, if acceptable, will then process your order.

   These Conditions of Sale will be provided to you with the
   Acknowledgement of Order through either e-mail link or pdf. Please
   carefully review these Conditions of Sale upon receipt.

   11. Confirmation of order

   Once your order has been approved by Cartier, following completion of
   our anti-fraud, security and related legal checks, we will send you by
   e-mail a written Confirmation of Order. The Written Confirmation of
   Order constitutes the acceptance of your order by Cartier and indicates
   the existence of a binding sales contract.

   12. ORDER SHIPMENT

   Upon shipment of the product you have ordered, Cartier will inform you
   by e-mail.

   13. PROOF OF AGREEMENT

   The Acknowledgement of Order and Confirmation of Order that are sent to
   you by e-mail are deemed to be received when you are able to access
   them on your computer, mobile or handheld device.

   The Acknowledgement of Order, Confirmation of Order and any automatic
   recording systems used by the Client Relations Center or the Platform
   will be proof of a binding agreement between you and Cartier.

   Estimated
   Delivery Lead Time

   e-mail address as a .pdf attachment. You may also at any time later
   request an invoice by calling the Client Relations Center
   (1.855.888.8798).^ Please note that Cartier may request that you
   provide proper identification as a condition to complying with such
   request.

   Cartier insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it
   is delivered to you. We require a signature by an adult at point of
   delivery to confirm your acceptance of each Cartier product delivered,
   at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you.
   If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes
   (for example as a gift) then you understand and accept that evidence of
   a signature by such recipient (or at that delivery address) is evidence
   of delivery and fulfillment of the sale contract by Cartier and
   transfer of responsibility to the recipient in the same way as if the
   product had been delivered to you.

   16. RETURN POLICY

   In order to ensure your total satisfaction, a Customer or a recipient
   of a gift of Cartier products (a “Gift Recipient”) may return Cartier
   products in accordance with the return and exchange policy set forth
   below. Returns of Cartier products that are not in compliance with the
   conditions and timeframes set forth below may be rejected by Cartier
   and will be sent back to the Customer or Gift Recipient, as the case
   may be.

   16.1. Return Period
   Cartier allows the Customer or Gift Recipient to return Cartier
   products purchased on the Platform or by phone directly with the Client
   Relations Center within thirty (30) days following delivery, but
   subject to the further terms and conditions set forth below.

   16.2. Return Process
   Products that have been purchased on the Platform or through the Client
   Relations Center may be returned to the Cartier e-boutique distribution
   center, at the following address: Richemont Canada, Attention:
   E-Commerce Returns, 4610 Eastgate Parkway, Unit #1, Mississauga, ON,
   L4W 3W6.

   Products that have not been purchased on the Platform or through the
   Client Relations Center may NOT be returned to the Cartier e-boutique
   distribution center.

   If a Customer or Gift Recipient wishes to return a product to the
   Cartier e-boutique distribution center, then such person must comply
   with the following steps:

   i) Call the Client Relations Center at 1.855.888.8798 to request a
   Return Authorization Number (RAN). This number is required prior to
   returning any product originally purchased from the Cartier e-Boutique
   by Internet or by phone with the Client Relations Center,

   ii) Fill out the required information, list the applicable Return
   Authorization Number (RAN) on the return form,

   iii) Include the completed return form with the product, all its
   accessories, the User Guide, the Warranty and/or Authenticity Card and
   all other documents, in its original box and delivery package,

   iv) Seal the delivery package and affix the pre-paid delivery label to
   it,

   v) Bring the package to any UPS location or call UPS to arrange
   pick-up.

   Should the Customer or Gift Recipient decide to return a purchased item
   within the 30-day period, Cartier and the Customer or Gift Recipient,
   as the case may be, agree that Cartier maintains a special interest in
   the merchandise and will therefore purchase insurance on the returned
   merchandise. Cartier is under no obligation to do so but will take this
   initiative for the Customer's or Gift Recipient’s convenience.

   The Customer or Gift Recipient, as the case may be, must keep a proof
   of return shipment and UPS tracking number, and Cartier accepts no
   liability in the event that such proof cannot be produced. Only
   merchandise received by the Cartier e-boutique distribution center will
   be eligible for a refund.

   Upon receiving a return, Cartier will verify that the returned product
   satisfies the conditions of the return policy and, if so, then proceed
   with the applicable refund or exchange.

   16.3. Conditions to Return a Product
   Cartier products must be returned in a new and unused state, in perfect
   condition, with all protective materials in place and tags and stickers
   attached to them (if applicable), as well as with the original Cartier
   box and delivery package, including all accessories and documents.
   Cartier will not accept any return if the product shows signs of wear,
   or has been used or altered from its original condition in any way.

   Watch bracelets that have been adjusted at the Customer’s request must
   be returned with the exact same number of links as in the original
   delivery package.

   Engraved or embossed products cannot be returned to Cartier for
   exchange or refund. Special order, personalized and made-to-order
   products cannot be returned to Cartier for exchange or refund.

   All returns will be subject to strict Quality Control (QC) by Cartier
   to ensure that the returned products satisfy these requirements. If the
   products do not meet QC standards, Cartier will refuse the return, and
   the products will be sent back to the Customer or the Gift Recipient,
   as applicable. If the returned product satisfies QC standards, Cartier
   will proceed with the applicable refund or exchange.

   16.4. Refunds and Merchandise Credits
   Should a product be returned to the Cartier e-boutique distribution
   center by the Customer or the Gift Recipient, only a Customer will be
   entitled to receive a refund of the purchase price. In no event will a
   Gift Recipient be entitled to receive a refund.

   If a Customer’s return complies with the return policy, Cartier will
   use reasonable efforts to refund the purchase price to the Customer
   using the same means of payment as used by the Customer for the initial
   transaction, no later than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the
   returned item by the Cartier e-boutique distribution center. Except for
   delivery of a defective product, initial shipping charges will not be
   refunded to the Customer.

   The Customer or the Gift Recipient may return a product to a Cartier
   retail boutique, the individual making the return being entitled to
   receive boutique merchandise credit only. No cash or credit card
   refunds will be issued in respect of a return to a Cartier retail
   boutique. Boutique merchandise credits can only be applied to products
   purchased in a Cartier retail boutique and cannot be applied to
   products purchased through the Platform or Client Relations Center.

   16.5. Exchanges
   Customers and Gift Recipients may be permitted to exchange a product
   purchased on the Platform for another Cartier product if the product to
   be exchanged satisfies the conditions of the return policy within
   thirty (30) days following delivery.

   Cartier will send an invoice as a .pdf attachment to the Customer’s
   e-mail address, which specifies the value of the returned product, the
   price of the item for which the original product has been exchanged and
   the difference to be paid by the Customer or the amount that the
   Customer is entitled to receive, as indicated below.

   Should a product be returned for exchange to the Cartier e-boutique
   distribution center by a Customer or Gift Recipient, only the Customer
   will be entitled to receive a refund of the price difference if the
   returned product is more expensive than the exchanged Cartier product.
   If the returned product is less expensive than the exchanged item, the
   Gift Recipient will be charged the difference in price.

   Should a product be returned for exchange to a Cartier retail boutique,
   either the Customer or Gift Recipient will be entitled to receive
   merchandise credit of the price difference, in case the original
   product is more expensive than the item to be received in the exchange.
   If the returned product is less expensive than the exchanged item, the
   Customer or Gift Recipient will be charged the difference in price.

   16.6. Defective products
   Cartier is extremely cautious in ensuring that each product strictly
   complies with our quality criteria and that it has passed all our
   controls, both technical and aesthetic.

   If nevertheless you receive a product that seems to be damaged, you may
   return it to Cartier in accordance with the return policy. Upon
   receipt, Cartier may classify the returned product as a defective
   product. Please note that items that are damaged as a result of wear
   and tear are not considered to be defective.

   If your product is declared as defective by Cartier, the following
   solutions will be proposed to the Customer or the Gift Recipient, as
   applicable:

   i) Cartier may send you the same product in the exact same size,
   subject to availability,

   ii) Cartier may propose an exchange for another Cartier creation of
   equivalent or higher value, in which case the initial price will be
   deducted and you will be required to pay only the difference, or

   Only you, as the Customer, may request a refund of the full price of
   your initial purchase.

   17. REPAIRS

   For any repair inquiries, please contact our Client Relations Center by
   e-mailing eboutique@cartier.ca or by calling 1.855.888.8798.

   18. GIFTS

   Cartier will send the invoice to your e-mail address as a .pdf
   attachment. Cartier will never send the invoice and payment details to
   the Gift Recipient.

   THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ERROR IS TO RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR A REFUND AS
   SET FORTH IN OUR RETURN POLICY.
