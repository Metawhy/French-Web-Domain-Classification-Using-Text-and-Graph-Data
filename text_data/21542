    I love how adding paint to furniture can easily give an updated look.
   It’s easy to modernize an outdated buffet with custom green paint or

   wanted to make a statement as we welcomed new guests into the guest
   suite.   This is how she looked when I…

   Do you have a hard time figuring out what to call your decorating
   style?  It used to be so simple because there were only a handful of

   Have you noticed the decorating trend of having bed runners or bed
   scarfs at the foot of the beds?  This is sometimes to replace a throw
   blanket or a heavy quilt.  You may have noticed them initially in hotel

   Have you ever thought about buying kitchen cabinets online?  Like most

   Where do I begin on sharing the modern kitchen makeover for the guest
