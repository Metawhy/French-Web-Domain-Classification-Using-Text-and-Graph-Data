   Music Morocco

Oum brings Moroccan music to a new horizon

   By RFI Issued on 14-10-2019 Modified 14-10-2019 to 14:22
   media Moroccan singer Oum at the Rio Loco festival in Toulouse on 15
   June 2019 RFI/Anne-Laure Lemancel

   Moroccan artist Oum was invited to the Rio Loco festival in Toulouse,
   southwestern France, to present her third album Daba. RFI's SessionLab
   met her.

   Released in August, Oum's new album Daba was conceived in Casablanca,
   recorded in Berlin and designed in Paris.

   Daba means "Now "in Moroccan dialect.

   "I came to realise that the present is nothing more or less than a
   transition. So the idea of being present in the "now" is not a task for
   a superhero. It’s just learning to pay a little more attention," Oum
   tells RFI's SessionLab.

   Considered to be ‘the ambassador of Moroccan music', she explains:

   "I’m not sure I deserve to be called an ambassador. I just enjoy making
   music, and learning who I am in that way. And, of course, I’m
   Moroccan."

   SessionLab is mixed in 3D Audio.

   War France Media Photography Normandy

RFI journalist among winners at France's war correspondents awards

   By RFI Issued on 13-10-2019 Modified 13-10-2019 to 16:09
   media Sami Boukhelifa (right), journalist for RFI, is handed the Bayeux
   Calvados-Normandy Award for war reporting in the radio category, 12
   October 2019. RFI

   The Bayeux-Calvados Normandy Awards for war correspondents were
   presented at a ceremony in Bayeux on Saturday evening. RFI's Sami
   Boukhelifa won first prize for his radio piece on the fall of the
   Syrian village of Baghouz, where jihadists held their last patch of
   territory until March 2019.

   For over 20 years, the town of Bayeux, in association with the Calvados
   Department and the Normandy Region, has been hosting this event to pay
   tribute to journalists who work in hazardous conditions and remember
   those who have perished.

   Bayeux, the first town in France that the Allies liberated in 1944,
   launched this annual international event in the framework of the
   50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994.

   More than forty in the jury, headed by Gary Knight

   More than forty war correspondents gathered in Bayeux for two days to
   debate and award trophies to journalists from around the world working
   in four media: the written press, radio, television and photography.

   War photographer Gary Knight was the jury president and host for the
   event's 26th year, which also featured screenings and conferences
   throughout the week.

   Patrick Chauvel, a freelancer for the weekly Paris Match won first
   prize for photo, for his work on Syria, "Syrie, la fin de Baghouz"
   (Syria, the end of Baghouz).

   Patrick Chauvel also won the prize chosen by the public.

   Fritz Schaap of Der Spiegel newspaper won the written prize award, for
   his project entitled "An epidemic and a war", focusing on the
   Democratic Republic of Congo.

   In television reporting, first prize went to BBC journalists Orla
   Guerin, Lee Durant and Nicola Careem for their documentary report about
   a bus hit by an air raid in Yemen.

   RFI journalist wins first prize in radio

   First prize in the radio category went to RFI's Sami Boukhelifa for his
   piece called "Voyage au bout du califat" (Journey to the end of the
   caliphate).

   Made in March 2019, in the north of Syria, Boukhelifa's report focuses
   on the battles between Kurdish soldiers, supported by the international
   coalition as they entered the final stages of the war against the
   Islamic State armed group.

   Sami Boukhelifa was able to report from the village of Baghouz,
   capturing the moments just before the collapse of the last major
   jihadist stronghold in the country.

   Wilson Fache was awarded the Young Reporter Trophy for print journalism
   for his article on Gaza published in L'Orient-le jour, The National
   newspaper and Vice.

   Reporting on the crisis in Kashmir won Clément Gargoullaud and Shafat
   Farooq the Grand Format Television Trophy (Babel Press for Arte), as
   well as the Video Image Trophy.

   The winner of the Television Trophy - Regional Prize for students and
   trainees of Normany went to AFP TV for a report on Venezuela called
   "Crisis at the border".

   To ensure that the names of the journalists killed in the line of duty
   are never forgotten, the City of Bayeux, in collaboration with
   Reporters without borders, erected a Memorial in 2007.

   France Scotland Murder Media Investigation

French press apologises for report after mistaken identity revealed in French
murder mystery

   By RFI Issued on 13-10-2019 Modified 13-10-2019 to 11:34
   media Journalists outside the house in Limay, west of Paris, searched
   by police in connection to an arrest of a man in Scotland who was
   thought to have been fugitive murder suspect Xavier Dupont De Ligonnes,
   12 October 2019 Thomas SAMSON / AFP

   Scotland's police on Saturday released a man after he was mistaken for
   a French fugitive wanted for killing his wife and four children eight
   years ago. Le Parisien newspaper, which on Friday reported the arrest
   in Glasgow, has reportedly apologised to the man and his family.

   French judicial sources had initially believed that they had finally
   caught up with Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, who was subject to an
   international arrest warrant for the 2011 killings which transfixed
   France.

   But Scotland's police said they had informed their French counterparts
   that forensic tests proved the man detained at Glasgow airport on
   Friday was not Dupont de Ligonnes.

   "Inquiries were undertaken to confirm the man's identity. Following the
   results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is
   not the man suspected of crimes in France," the police," said in a
   statement.

   "The man has since been released. The man and his family have no wish
   to speak to the media at this time and ask that their privacy be
   respected on this matter."

   Sources close to the probe said the conclusion was reached after DNA
   tests.

   Le Parisien, which published the original story of the man's arrest
   based on police sources said in a statement it wanted to express its
   "sincere regret for having made public information which turned out to
   be wrong".

   Several other media outlets, including AFP, offered reasons for doing
   the same.
     * What lead to such confusion?

   The detained man was stopped in Glasgow after arriving on a flight from
   Paris following an anonymous tip-off, according to French sources close
   to the investigation.

   A police search was carried out on Friday at the arrested man's house
   in Limay in the western suburbs of Paris.

   Neighbours told AFP the house belonged to Guy Joao, a man of Portuguese
   origin with French and British nationality and who is married to a
   Scottish woman.

   Neighbours interviewed by the press said they were shocked. They had
   known Joao for thirty years, and said Joao did not "look anything like"
   Dupont de Ligonnes.

   Dupont de Ligonnes, 58, is suspected of shooting his family dead and
   burying them under the terrace of their townhouse in Nantes, western
   France.

   Japan Storm Typhoon Rugby World Cup 2019

Japan struggles with rescue in aftermath of destructive storm

   By RFI Issued on 13-10-2019 Modified 13-10-2019 to 12:02
   media A collapsed railway bridge is seen over Chikuma river swollen by
   Typhoon Hagibis in Ueda, central Japan, October 13, 2019 Kyodo/via
   REUTERS

   At least 14 people were killed and nine others missing after Typhoon
   Hagibis slammed into Japan, officials said Sunday, as rescuers
   scrambled to reach people trapped by catastrophic flooding. The storm's
   "unprecedented" heavy rain triggered deadly landslides and caused
   rivers to burst their banks.

   By Sunday morning, the significantly weakened storm had moved back off
   land, but serious flooding was reported in several areas, including
   central Japan's Nagano, where a burst levee sent water from the Chikuma
   river gushing into residential neighbourhoods, flooding homes up to the
   second floor.

   Military called in

   Japan's military deployed 27,000 troops to aid rescue operations,
   including some in helicopters who winched people from the roofs and
   balconies of flooded homes in Nagano.

   In Kawagoe, northwest of Tokyo, rescue workers in boats were evacuating
   elderly people from a retirement home that was heavily flooded in the
   storm.

   One woman wearing an orange life vest clutched at rescue workers in
   hardhats as the boat moved through the muddy floodwaters.

   Hagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu around 7:00 pm
   (1000 GMT) Saturday as one of the most violent typhoons in recent
   years, with wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres per hour.

   The storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when
   high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver.

   Landslides and flooding claimed more lives overnight, and the toll
   climbed higher after sunrise on Sunday, as the scale of the devastation
   wrought by Hagibis became clear.

   Rugby World Cup organisers to cancel third match

   On Sunday morning, organisers said they had been forced to cancel a
   third fixture, Namibia-Canada, but gave the go-ahead to three others
   including a crunch Japan-Scotland game in Yokohama, near Tokyo.

   Scotland faced elimination if the match was cancelled and had
   threatened legal action if it was not played.

   Pakistan Iran Saudi Arabia Imran Khan Hassan Rohani Riyadh Tehran

Pakistan’s Imran Khan travels to Iran and Saudi Arabia to mediate crisis

   By RFI Issued on 13-10-2019 Modified 13-10-2019 to 14:52
   media Iranian President Hassan Rouhani shakes hands with Pakistani
   Prime Minister Imran Khan in Tehran, Iran, October 13, 2019. Official
   Presidential website/Handout via REUTERS

   Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan visited Iran on Sunday following a
   request from the United States and Saudi Arabia for him to try to
   defuse rising tensions in the Gulf. It is his second visit this year to
   Iran, which shares a border of about 1,000 kilometres with Pakistan.

   Khan's office said his visit was part of an initiative "to promote
   peace and security in the region", and that he would hold talks with
   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan
   Rouhani.

   Khan landed in Tehran and was greeted at the airport by Foreign
   Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif before going into a meeting with Rouhani.

   Iran’s Mehr News Agency played down Kahn’s visit but quoted Iranian
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi as saying that "the
   Islamic Republic has announced that it is always ready, with or without
   a mediator, to hold talks with its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia."

   Attacks on shipping

   There has been a spate of still-unexplained attacks on shipping in and
   around the vital seaway involving Iran and Western powers, as well as
   drone attacks on Saudi oil installations.

   Washington accused Tehran of attacking the vessels with mines and of
   being behind the drone assault, something it strongly denies.

   Pakistan has strong relations with Saudi Arabia, with more than 2.5
   million of its nationals living and working in the kingdom.

   But it also maintains good relations with Iran and represents Tehran's
   consular interests in the United States.

   Khan met both Rouhani and US President Donald Trump at the United
   Nations General Assembly last month, shortly after he visited Crown
   Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia.

   The Arabian Al Arabyia website reported that Kahn will travel to Riyadh
   to meet with Saudi leaders.
