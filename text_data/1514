COMO @MOCO’17

   8 Jul , 2017

   We presented the first version of COMO – Collective Movement, at the
   International Conference on Movement and Computing, Goldsmiths
   University of London, 2017.

   COMO is a collection of prototype Web Apps for movement-based sound
   interaction, targeting collective interaction using mobile phones.

   COMO is based on a software ecosystem developed by IRCAM,
   using XMM (see in particular xmm-soundworks-template, Collective
   Soundworks, waves.js. intergrating the RAPID-MIX API.

   The idea behind the implementation of COMO is to have a distributed
   interactive machine learning architecture. It consists of lightweight
   client-side JavaScript libraries that enable recording gestures and
   performing analysis/recognition, and of a server performing the
   training and storage of statistical models.

CoSiMa presentation

   3 Jun , 2017

   Presentation of the CoSiMa project, June 2 2017, IRCAM, Manifeste
   Festival

   The research project CoSiMa is a part of a powerful movement that, in
   the past 10 years, has witnessed changes in medias and their
   relationships with users with the emergence of tangible interfaces,
   augmented reality, and the web environment. Its aim is to explore these
   new relationships via new interfaces and collaborative tools for
   creation based on the latest web and mobile technologies.

   The CoSiMa project focused on the production of open tools and an
   authoring platform accessible for experiments with a large range of
   applications.  Its applications include audiovisual installations,
   group performances, innovative participative experiences, interactive
   fictions in the framework of artistic and educational projects,
   innovative public services, special events, and communication.

   Productions from the CoSiMa project (2013-2017): Conference and
   collective interactive experiences.
   ANR project coordinated by IRCAM (UMR STMS Ircam / CNRS / Université
   Pierre et Marie Curie)
   Partners: EnsadLab, ESBA TALM, ID Scenes, No Design, Orbe

Square

   3 Jun , 2017

   Square is a sonorous perambulation for the general public with
   headphones. Connected to a Website and using geo-localization, each
   participant dives into an electronic, spatialized universe. A
   combination of real—a “guided tour” of the place Stravinksy—and
   electronic fiction through headphones that alters the space, inspired
   by recordings made in the same location at a different time. A
   contemplative and cinematographic experience, Square is the result of
   Lorenzo Bianchi’s artistic research with the Interaction Sound Music
   Movement team.

   For ensemble of mobile terminals, interactive system, and system for
   binaural holophonic diffusion on headphones

Le son au bout des doigts installation, Centre Pompidou

   1 Jun , 2017

   Le son au bout des doigts is an installation shown 1.6.–18.6. at the
   Centre Pompidou and part of Ircam’s Manifeste festival using ISMM’s
   gesture recognition and interactive sound synthesis technology.

   It offers a playful, interactive, sonorous and visual journey for
   children ages two and up. Through manipulations and listening, the
   children’s sight and hearing is solicited. In Topo-phonie Café imagined
   by B. MacFarlane, the children are guided by a game of organic
   structures. They set special tables that create sonorous suprises.

   With DIRTI developed by User Studio/Matthieu Savary, when children sink
   their hands in different materials that fill interactive tubs they set
   off sounds and images. More…
