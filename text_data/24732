   Serving Industry: If you are working in industry on AI/ML for IoT
   systems, I would love to schedule a discovery session to learn how we
   can serve you with our upcoming NSF industry-university consortium.
   Open Positions: looking for a postdoc to join my team. If you are
   attending ICSE'19 lets talk.

   SHORT BIO
   Danny Dig is an associate professor of computer science in the School
   of EECS at Oregon State University, and an adjunct professor at
   University of Illinois. He enjoys doing research in Software
   Engineering, with a focus on interactive program transformations that
   improve programmer productivity and software quality. He successfully
   pioneered interactive program transformations by opening the field of
   refactoring in cutting-edge domains including mobile, concurrency and
   parallelism, component-based, testing, and end-user programming. He
   earned his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
   where his research won the best Ph.D. dissertation award, and the First
   Prize at the ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals. He did a
   postdoc at MIT.

   He (co-)authored 50+ journal and conference papers that appeared in top
   places in SE/PL. According to Google Scholar his publications have been
   cited 3700+ times. His research was recognized with 8 best paper awards
   at the flagship and top conferences in SE (FSE'17, ICSME'17, FSE'16,
   ICSE'14, ISSTA'13, ICST'13, ICSME'15), 4 award runner-ups, and 1 most
   influential paper award (N-10 years) at ICSME'15. He received the NSF
   CAREER award, the Google Faculty Research Award (twice), and the
   Microsoft Software Engineering Innovation Award (twice). He released 9
   software systems, among them the world's first open-source refactoring
   tool. Some of the techniques he developed are shipping with the
   official release of the popular Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio
   development environments (of which Eclipse alone had more than 14M
   downloads in 2014). He has started two popular workshops: Workshop on
   Refactoring Tools, and Hot Topics On Software Upgrades, both had at
   least five instances. He chaired or co-organized 14 workshops and 1
   conference (MobileSoft'15), and served as a member of 35 program
   committees for all top conferences in his area. His research is funded
   by NSF, Boeing, IBM, Intel, Google, and Microsoft.

   RESEARCH INTERESTS
   Successful software undergoes constant change. My research addresses
   two important questions:
    1. What changes occur most often in practice?
    2. How can we automate them to improve programmers' productivity and
       software quality?

   Over the years I have successfully automated program transformations to
   (i) retrofit parallelism into sequential code, (ii) improve
   responsiveness of mobile apps, (iii) upgrade component-based
   applications, (iv) update obsolete tests, (v) make end-user programs
   easier to change.

   General interests:- automated refactoring, interactive program analysis
   and transformation, design & architectural patterns, and broadly
   interested in concurrency and parallelism, mobile computing, software
   development processes, program analysis, software testing, and software
   evolution

   Research Impact:
     * our research on detecting async errors in .NET programs now ships
       with the official release of Microsoft Visual Studio
     * my ICSM'05 paper wins the Most Influential Paper Award (N-10 years)
       at ICSME'15. The citation reads "The ICSM'05 paper has had the most
       impact and has stood the test of time best, it has had a profound
       influence on the upcoming field of API analysis."
     * our refactorings that empower Java programmers to use lambda
       expressions are shipping with the official release of the NetBeans
       IDE.
     * PhD research on record-and-replay of API-level refactoring ships
       with the official release of the Eclipse IDE and are used by
       millions of Java developers.
     * the automatic inference of refactorings has been used at large
       companies like Google and IBM, and dozens of research labs.
     * our ASTGen test generation framework is used in the testing
       infrastructure at Oracle.
     * empirical studies (one and two) on usage of concurrent libraries
       have influenced the development of the official libraries in .NET
       and Java.
     * our resource on learning parallelism in .NET receives more than
       150,000 visitors.
     * many years ago I developed the world's first open-source
       refactoring engine for Java, and was downloaded over 17,000 times.
