   MasterTrack™ Certificates are earned by completing a concatenation of
   graduate-level courses offered on the Coursera platform by some of the
   world's most elite universities. Those same universities may allow
   qualified, admitted students to apply earned MasterTrack™ Certificate
   credits towards related Master's degrees, leading to an affordable
   academic degree. Coursera does not grant academic credit, and does not
   guarantee that completion of a MasterTrack™ Certificate will result in
   academic credit; the decision to grant, accept, or transfer academic
   credit is subject to the sole and absolute discretion of an academic
   institution.
