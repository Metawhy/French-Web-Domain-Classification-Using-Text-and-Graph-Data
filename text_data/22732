The name

   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [stemma-locorotondo.jpg]

   The name derives from the old Latin Locus Rotundus, “rounded place”. At
   the beginning of the 13th century, placed on a hill peak surrounded by
   a walled ring, the borgo assumed the circular shape that gave it its
   name, which also appeared in various documents in the following
   centuries.

Do not miss

   Locorotondo is the most beautiful balcony in the Murgia of Trulli, the
   typical local houses. From its lookout, you can admire the charming
   territory. A mosaic made of small vineyards surrounded by stoned walls,
   scrubs of Mediterranean forests and silvery olive groves that surround
   the old manor farms, thousands of trulli houses spread in the borgo.
   Moreover, the small old centre of Locorotondo, closed into its circular
   perfection of stone and mortar, once marked by walls, seems hanging
   between dream and reality. The white colour of lime wraps everything,
   it looks like the flashing background of local stone Baroque
   architecture, underlining the intense colour of flowers on the
   balconies. Peculiar peaky roofs called cummerse, made of grey stone
   called chiancarelle, exalt the façades, that inside represent the
   typical environment of star vaults. In the town centre there is no
   particular architecture that stands out, everything is gracious and
   intimate and you can feel the sense of order, respect, and mature
   civility that surrounds this small treasure chest of faith and art.
   From Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, where two 19th century big pillars mark
   the old Porta Napoli, you can follow a long path where you can see
   buildings such as the former Town hall, today the Communal Library from
   the end of the 18th century, the Baroque Palazzo Morelli with its
   splendid portal and small balconies with wrought iron railings and, up
   ahead, the Mother Church. Dedicated to Saint George, was built between
   1790 and 1825, where previously there were three churches dedicated to
   the same saint. It has a 16th century façade and a Greek cross plan.
   Inside it preserves 42 marble basrelief headstones in of the end of the
   16th century, with stories from the Old and New Testament, some Baroque
   altars made of polychrome wedged marble blocks (1764) and a series of
   paintings by Gennaro Maldarelli (1838-41) from Naples. In the crypt
   there are the remains of a 19th century burial site, some silver
   objects and urns. Near the church there is the small 19th century
   Church of Annunziata, built where an old oratory from 1633 used to be,
   that inside preserves some wooden statues and papier-mâché. The Church
   of Madonna della Greca is more important. Its origins are still unknown
   and the first document where this church is mentioned is from 1520, but
   some architectonic elements, such as a half barrel vault, lead you to
   believe that it is older than is presumed (12th -13th century). It has
   one nave and three aisles with column base and capitals decorated with
   a medieval motif. A rich group of objects sculptured in stone comes
   from the old chapel of the Mother Church. The most significant are a
   triptych of the high altar and sculptures of Saint George (1559). The
   Church of San Nicola (1660) is very original, with its chiancarelle
   stone covering, typical of trulli. Inside, it has frescoed vaults and
   an old stone basrelief representing the Crucifixion. And finally, the
   small church of the Hospital, out of the town centre, dates back to the
   middle of the 16th century, it has a beautiful apse, embellished by the
   remains of a fresco representing a prayer addressed to Christ.

Local products and dishes

   Secular devotion for grape cultivation favoured the production of
   excellent quality white wine, such as the famous Doc Locorotondo a
   fresh, light, dry white wine, ideal for appetizers, excellent with fish
   and shellfish.
