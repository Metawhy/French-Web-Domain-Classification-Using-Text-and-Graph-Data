   Sting tells the stories behind his play 'Last Ship' at private Opera
   House event...

   Sting was in Detroit Monday evening selling a story of community, hard
   work, love and passion set in a city that is suffering the effects of
   losing the main industry that keeps its people alive. The Grammy
   Award-winning musician performed for a small audience of Broadway in
   Detroit for season subscribers, sponsors and local media Tuesday night
   to promote his upcoming musical, "The Last Ship." He'll be back in
   April to star in the Tony Award-nominated musical - or a play with
   music, as he describes it - when "The Last Ship"...

   Sting gives private Ordway show to promote his upcoming play...

   He'll return in April to star in "The Last Ship" about his hometown in
   England. There was Sting, rock’s Renaissance man, seated on a chair,
   acoustic guitar in hand, lyrics on a tablet on a music stand, at the
   sparsely filled Ordway Concert Hall on Sunday evening. Playing to his
   smallest Twin Cities audience since his local debut with the Police 40
   years ago at the long-gone Longhorn rock club, Sting came to share the
   story and songs of “The Last Ship,” his 2014 Broadway bust that’s
   coming to the Ordway in April - with Sting in a starring role.

     SUMMONER'S TALES...
     "Nothing is worth doing if there isn't some kind of risk. With this
     project I'm always thinking, 'Will the audience like this? Will the
     orchestra enjoy it? Will I enjoy it?' There are no guarantees. Only
     idiots are fearless. I tend to want to take things on to see what
     happens. I get bored easily but I don't, you know, sky-dive."
