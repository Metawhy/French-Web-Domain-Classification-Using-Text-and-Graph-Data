Croatia: road safety education initiative for parents

   Published Mon, 06/02/2017 - 13:30

   Children, as they are not fully physically developed, are the most
   vulnerable road users, especially in the role of pedestrians,
   bicyclists and vehicle passengers. Ensuring safety of every child
   during transportation in a personal vehicle, from the first day, should
   be a responsibility of every parent.
