Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop - September 25, 2019

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.

Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop - September 25, 2019

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.

Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

       I read Where The Crawdad's Sing this summer. It's a great book
       isn't it. I though it was unique.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

       times to decorate cupcakes for my boys' birthday parties.

       Hope you are already enjoying the beginning of this girls weekend
       with your friends. Sounds like such fun.
       Love the eyes!! And the pillows. I am all about the pumpkins that
       are pale greens and blue. Actually saw some real ones at Walmart
       yesterday. So pretty!

       Those pillow covers are gorgeous - they almost look hand painted.
       Such a small change that can brighten/freshen things up alot. I
       should do that to freshen up my living room.
       Hope you're doing well my friend. :)

Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.

Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop - September 25, 2019

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.

Book Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

   Hey there!  Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday.  I'm thinking about
   a book I recently read and the experience of meeting the author.
   Where the Crawdads Sing had been all the buzz around blog land for
   quite some time before it bubbled to the top of my reading list.  But
   as soon as I started reading it, I knew it wouldn't stay unread for
   long.  This was a real page turner for me!
   Where the Crawdads Sing by [Owens, Delia]
   In case you haven't heard about this book, here's the summary from
   Amazon:

     For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a
     quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
     handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect
     Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.
     Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the
     marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons
     in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and
     loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild
     beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
     happens.

     Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the
     Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a
     heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible
     murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children
     we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and
     violent secrets that nature keeps.

   If you're thinking you've not read a book by Delia Owens before,
   there's a good reason for that.  This is her first fiction book.  It's
   so beautiful written, I had a hard time believing this was her first
   novel!  Delia's background as a wildlife scientist comes through in the
   way she eloquently describes the nature of the swamp.
   On my recent trip to Kansas City, I had the opportunity to attend an
   author event sponsored by Rainy Day Books with Delia Owens.  Our book
   club, The Book Babes, had read this book as part of our book club and
   many of us were able to attend the author event together.  As she sat
   on the stage and talked about her work in Africa, living is Idaho and
   and life in general, you couldn't help but fall in love with her!
   [delia%2Bon%2Bstage.jpg]
   After speaking for about an hour and answering questions submitted by
   the audience, we had an opportunity to have our books signed.  The
   crowd numbered over 900, so the line needed to move along quickly.  The
   taking of photos was limited.  In true form for me, as I approach this
   celebrity my mouth became dry and I could barely utter a single word.
   "Thanks for doing this" was all I could get out while she signed the
   349384939 book of this tour.
   [signing%2Bmy%2Bbook.jpg]
   If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.  And if Delia
   Owens is coming to a town near you, get tickets!  You won't be
   disappointed.

       I read Where The Crawdad's Sing this summer. It's a great book
       isn't it. I though it was unique.

Five on Friday - September 27, 2019

   Happy Fall Friday!  Can you believe we are already at the end of
   September?  This month has flown by!  So here's my last Five on Friday
   for September ~
   1.  Candy Eyes
   We're in the last week of September friends and Halloween is going to
   be here before you know it.  Have you seen all the adorable treats made
   with those candy eyes?  Pop them on just about anything and it becomes
   a cute treat worthy of top mom honors.  They are available HERE, from
   Amazon, and will arrive at your doorstop.  You know you're busy - just
   order some and have them on hand.

    Ghost Pretzels - White chocolate dipped pretzels are made into ghosts
              with candy eyes and a little bit of imagination.

   2.  Fall Pillow Covers
   I invested in a set of 18x18 pillows last year and have been changing
   out the covers for each holiday ever since.  Best.Decision.Ever.  After
   your initial investment in the pillows, the covers are relatively
   inexpensive.  Example - for all four pillow covers shown in the
   picture, it's under $20.  And you can use them for years to come!  They
   add such a fun pop of fall to our furniture!

   3.  National Coffee Day
   Calling all coffee drinkers - Sunday is your day!  It's National Coffee
   Day!  Some stores are giving you a real reason to celebrate.  Pop in a
   participating Krispy Kreme to get a free Original Glazed Doughnut and
   one free brewed coffee - no strings attached.  Dunkin' is offering a
   buy one, get one free deal.  Barnes and Noble will give you a free iced
   or hot tall coffee with a purchase of a bakery case item.  I couldn't
   find anything on Starbucks so I called their headquarters.  The
   gentlemen I spoke with, after putting me on hold for a bit, said they
   weren't aware of any specials that day.  Really Starbucks - you
   disappoint me.
   National Coffee Day - September 29
   4.  Judy
   Oh man - I'm looking forward to seeing this movie!  There's something
   about Judy Garland that just intrigues me.  Can't wait to see how this
   one plays out.  Here's the synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes:

     Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging
     London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town.
     It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz,
     but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only
     grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms
     musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and
     warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she
     embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be
     fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film
     celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz
     of "the world's greatest entertainer."

   This is going to be an epic weekend.  I'm taking the Amtrak train over
   to Kansas City this morning for Girls Weekend!  The itinerary for the
   weekend is packed with all things fabulous.  Some of the highlights are
   going to see the Downton Abbey movie (second time seeing it for me),
   doing high tea and meeting Delia Owens who is the author is Where the
   Crawdad Sing.  Enough with all those things planned, the thing I'm
   really looking forward to the very most is just hanging out with my
   friends.  Yes, I'm so darn excited to get this weekend started!  Pop
   back in next week to hear how it all played out.

       Hope you are already enjoying the beginning of this girls weekend
       with your friends. Sounds like such fun.
       Love the eyes!! And the pillows. I am all about the pumpkins that
       are pale greens and blue. Actually saw some real ones at Walmart
       yesterday. So pretty!

       Those pillow covers are gorgeous - they almost look hand painted.
       Such a small change that can brighten/freshen things up alot. I
       should do that to freshen up my living room.
       Hope you're doing well my friend. :)

Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

       That library looks fantastic! I loved touring the old castles in
       France; there is something about those old castles that I just find
       fascinating.

       Oh, that library!! Warms this librarian's heart. Would love to
       spend a few hours there. And then enjoy tea and all the decorum
       that accompanies it. Ireland has moved to the top of my travel
       bucket list. And seeing your pics and reading that you absolutely
       enjoyed your trip and would go back again, just confirms it.

       Golly, that was a trip of a lifetime...I'm so happy you enjoyed it!
       The library was fantastic, all that history, and who wouldn't want
       to delve into those gorgeous tea goodies...sigh. There is something
       to be said for Old World everything!

Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop - September 25, 2019

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.
