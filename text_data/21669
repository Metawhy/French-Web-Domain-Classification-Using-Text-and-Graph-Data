Serge Gay Jr. Offers Ode to Palm Springs

   by Andy SmithPosted on October 3, 2019

   Serge Gay Jr. offers a love letter to resort city Palm Springs in his
   new show, “P.S. I Love You,” at Voss Gallery. Bathed in sunshine and a
   Mid-Century Modern sensibility, the works are a stirring blend of
   acrylics and graphite. “Popularized in the 1930s as a fashionable
   getaway for the Hollywood elite, the human-built utopia has become a
   haven for creatives lured to the vast desert as an artistic escape and
   source for inspiration,” the gallery says. The show, which begins on
   Oct. 11, runs through Nov. 2 at the San Francisco space.

Memorial Statue Depicts Wolves of New York City

   by Andy SmithPosted on October 3, 2019

   It appears that sculptor Joe Reginella has once again erected a
   memorial statue marking a fictional occurrence in New York City. This
   time, it’s a story that purports that former Mayor Ed Koch sent wolves
   into the subways of the city to ward off graffiti artists during his
   tenure, and according to the Ed Koch Wolf Foundation (who supposedly
   put up the memorial), the creatures are still the reason behind missing
   tourists in the Big Apple.

   by Andy SmithPosted on October 2, 2019

   [ES6.jpg]

   Eleanor Scholz’s intricate wood burnings blend gorgeous lattice work
   with depictions of organic forms. Utah Museum of Contemporary Art says
   the pyrography practitioner explores the subconscious and “also deals
   with issues of the spiritual impulse in a largely secular and
   spiritually ambiguous society.”

   Savage Gallery, titled “Entre Vues,” offers themes of “post-web racial

   in their sculptured form.

   Paris-based duo MonkeyBird is known for enormous stencil work on walls
   across the globe. Their anthropomorphic figures, often rendered as
   black-and-white line drawings, are set against gorgeously rendered
