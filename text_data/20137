Première utilisation de Cardiologs en France

   11.07.2018

   L’Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud (ICPS) annonce la première
   utilisation en France de l’intelligence artificielle Cardiologs pour le
   diagnostic d’arythmies cardiaques par Holter ECG.

   L’équipe de cardiologie de l’ICPS (Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud)
   est un groupe de renommée mondiale, reconnu pour son engagement en
   faveur de l’innovation. L’ICPS est notamment spécialisé dans le
   diagnostic et le traitement des arythmies cardiaques, que l’on peut
   diagnostiquer par un enregistrement continu de l’activité électrique du
   cœur pendant plusieurs jours (appelé « électrocardiogramme ambulatoire
   » ou « Holter ECG »).

   Parmi la quinzaine d’arythmies détectables par Holter ECG, la
   fibrillation atriale est notamment un enjeu majeur de santé publique,
   car estimée être la cause d’un AVC sur trois. L’AVC (Accident
   Vasculaire Cérébral) est la première cause de handicap chez l’adulte,
   souvent responsable de séquelles lourdes. Chaque année, on dénombre
   près de 17 millions de nouveaux cas d’AVC dans le monde dont 150,000 en
   France.^1

   L’analyse de Holter ECG pose cependant problème car très chronophage
   pour les médecins, ce qui constitue un frein majeur au diagnostic des
   arythmies.

   Forte de son engagement en faveur de l’innovation, l’ICPS est devenue
   la première institution en France à intégrer dans sa pratique clinique
   la plateforme d’analyse des ECG ambulatoires développée par Cardiologs.
   L’utilisation de Cardiologs permet à l’ICPS d’analyser plus
   efficacement les enregistrements Holter ECG, ce qui a pour effet une
   amélioration de la pratique et des bénéfices pour le patient.

   La plateforme d’analyse ECG Cardiologs a été développée à Paris par une
   équipe internationale d’ingénieurs et chercheurs en intelligence
   artificielle aux côtés de cardiologues experts de l’ECG. L’algorithme
   mis au point par Cardiologs a été entraîné à partir d’une base de
   données de plus de 600,000 ECG et continue de progresser au fur et à
   mesure que la base de données s’enrichit.

   La technologie innovante de Cardiologs rentre parfaitement dans le
   cadre de l’engagement de l’ICPS pour l’innovation dans la pratique
   clinique. L’intelligence artificielle a le potentiel de transformer la
   santé pour améliorer le service rendu à nos patients. » dit le Dr
   Laurent Fiorina, cardiologue à l’ICPS, et qui a participé au
   développement de Cardiologs.

   C’est un privilège pour Cardiologs de nouer ce partenariat avec une
   institution de renom telle que l’ICPS, et je pense que l’adoption de
   Cardiologs par cette équipe valide encore davantage l’utilité et
   l’intérêt de notre solution en pratique clinique » dit Yann Fleureau,
   co-fondateur et PDG de Cardiologs.

Cardiologs Raises $6.4M Series A

   05.10.2017

   Company’s cloud-based and Artificial Intelligence-powered ECG analysis
   solution assists healthcare professionals in screening for heart
   diseases.

   Cardiologs Technologies announced today that it has raised $6.4 million
   in a Series A financing with a syndicate of life science and technology
   investors (Idinvest, ISAI, Kurma Partners, Partech Ventures) and with
   continued support and participation from current investor Bpifrance
   seed fund (F3A). This round brings total funding of Cardiologs to $10
   million. Proceeds will be dedicated to fast-forward commercialisation
   of the Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform in the United States and
   Europe.“Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology”. “Ambulatory ECG analysis and reporting is a
   labor-intensive process that can result in delays for arrhythmia
   detection and increased costs,” said Yann Fleureau, co-founder and CEO
   of Cardiologs Technologies. “Our Cardiologs team has trained a neural
   network using more than 500,000 recordings, and this training dataset
   keeps growing,” said Fleureau. “The result is that Cardiologs is
   designed to recognise patterns in a cardiac signal for fast and precise
   analysis of heart diseases in a similar intuitive manner as expert
   cardiologists,” said Fleureau.In July 2017, Cardiologs announced FDA
   clearance of its Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform, an ECG- analysis web
   solution powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cardiologs assists
   physicians in screening for 10 arrhythmias including Atrial
   Fibrillation (AFib) using ambulatory ECG monitoring recordings.

   Why solving Ambulatory ECG analysis is important
     * Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is the most common human arrhythmia,
       affecting about 33 million patients worldwide. AFib is a growing
       problem in cardiovascular disease and is associated with an
       increased risk of severe stroke, heart failure, and death.^1
     * AFib is often asymptomatic and silent with stroke as the first
       manifestation. Recent stroke registries indicate that AFib is
       associated with one-third of all ischemic strokes.
     * The Ambulatory ECG records continuously the electrical activity of
       the heart (ECG) up to a few weeks. It is the gold standard
       examination to detect AFib and other arrhythmias (for example
       bradycardia, which is a cause of syncope).
     * The Ambulatory ECG analysis aims to detect the episodes of
       arrhythmia. Only a few minutes of arrhythmia can occur during a
       whole week of recording, making the process labor- intensive.
     * Solving ambulatory ECG analysis results in significant cost-savings
       for the healthcare system, earlier diagnostic and decreased risk of
       stroke for the patient, time savings and increased performance for
       the healthcare professional.

   How Cardiologs works
     * A cardiologist recovers a digital ECG from any compatible ECG
       device — such as a Holter monitor, smartwatch, ECG patch or even a
       connected t-shirt—then uploads it to the Cardiologs cloud and is
       able to immediately leverage our technology to identify relevant
       events.
     * It is especially powerful for long-term recordings that require
       today a very laborious manual analysis process.
     * ECG monitoring product and service companies can also benefit from
       Cardiologs in just three lines of code via the company’s web API.

   Availability in Europe and the United States

   The Cardiologs solution is CE-marked and has been approved to detect up
   to 100 cardiac abnormalities in Europe. Currently, the detection of 10
   significant arrhythmias is available in the United States, which covers
   most clinical cases of ambulatory ECG monitoring. The company plans to
   further extend its AI capacity beyond ECG diagnostics claims.

   Supporting quotes

   “Cardiologs is the perfect example of applying state-of-the-art machine
   learning techniques to help professionals work much faster and more
   accurately. And in this case, it can save a lot of lives,” said Benoist
   Grossmann, Managing Partner at Idinvest.J-David Chamboredon, CEO of
   ISAI, added: “Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology.””Cardiologs has assembled a world-class team with a unique
   combination of mathematical and engineering skills,” said Reza
   Malekzadeh, General Partner at Partech Ventures. “It is great to see
   them out to solve a global problem with a solution that will bring
   better healthcare to a greater number at a more affordable cost.”

   Scientific Validation of Cardiologs

   When defining the reliability of diagnosing AFib and other arrhythmias,
   the term Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers to the percentage of
   true positive cases among total cases detected. Conventional “state-of-
   the-art” PPV for detecting AFib is less than 59%[1]. The PPV for
   Cardiologs’ detection of AFib was 91%[2] included in the cleared FDA
   submission. In addition, also as included in the cleared FDA
   submission, Cardiologs’ sensitivity for detecting AFib was reported to
   be 97%[3] (the percentage of positive cases truly identified) and was
   superior to “state-of-the-art” conventional methods of detecting AFib
   and other arrhythmias. Cardiologs’ study results have been published in
   the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology (2016, Vol. 23(2S 41-55).
   The study’s investigators concluded: “This (Cardiologs) method may be
   more reliable and accurate than previous methods in the diagnosis of
   AFib on long-duration ambulatory ECG and other monitoring devices”.

Cardiologs Receives FDA Clearance

   05.07.2017

   Cardiologs is the world’s most advanced cloud-based and Artificial
   Intelligence-powered ECG analysis solution to aid healthcare
   professionals in screening for arrhythmias such as AFib using
   ambulatory ECG monitoring recordings.

   Cardiologs Technologies SAS announced today that it has received FDA
   clearance of its Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform, a cloud-based
   cardiac monitoring-analysis web service powered by artificial
   intelligence (AI). Cardiologs aids physicians in screening for atrial
   fibrillation (AFib) and other arrhythmias using long-term ambulatory
   ECG monitoring recordings. The Cardiologs system is also CE-marked in
   Europe.

   “This (Cardiologs) method may be more reliable and accurate than
   previous methods in the diagnosis of AFib on long-duration ambulatory
   ECG and other monitoring devices.”

   Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common human arrhythmia,
   affecting about 33 million patients worldwide. AFib is a growing
   problem in cardiovascular disease and is associated with an increased
   risk of severe stroke, heart failure, and death. AFib is often
   asymptomatic, with stroke as the first manifestation. Indeed, recent
   stroke registries indicate that AFib is associated with one-third of
   all ischemic strokes.

   “It is intuitive that screening for AFib and subsequent anticoagulant
   treatment should reduce the stroke burden, which is the basis of
   guideline recommendations to screen for AFib in persons over the age of
   65,” said Dr. Arnaud Rosier, cardiac electrophysiologist at the Hôpital
   Jacques Cartier, Massy. “Unfortunately, current R-R interval based
   methods to detect AFib are characterised by an inferior Positive
   Predictive Value (PPV) of under 59%, leading to misdiagnoses, mostly
   false positives, that add significant cost to the healthcare system
   while burdening healthcare resources and placing unnecessary stress on
   misdiagnosed patients or putting undiagnosed patients in harm’s way.”

   “Cardiologs is a game-changer for arrhythmia screening,” added Yann
   Fleureau, co-founder and CEO of Cardiologs Technologies. “A
   cardiologist recovers a digital ECG from any compatible cardiac
   monitoring device—such as a Holter monitor, smartwatch, ECG patch or
   even a connected t-shirt—then uploads it to the Cardiologs cloud and is
   able to immediately leverage our technology to identify relevant
   events. It is especially powerful for long-term recordings that used to
   require a very laborious manual analysis process.

   “Our Cardiologs team has trained a neural network using more than
   500,000 recordings, and this training dataset keeps growing,” said
   Fleureau. “The result is that Cardiologs is designed to recognise
   patterns in a cardiac signal for fast and precise analysis of
   arrhythmias such as AFib in a similar intuitive manner as expert
   cardiologists. We especially bring the P-wave detection (atrial
   activity) to a whole new level, which explains our radically better
   PPV,” said Fleureau.

   Scientific Validation of Cardiologs

   When defining the reliability of diagnosing AFib and other arrhythmias,
   the term Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers to the percentage of
   true positive cases among total cases detected. Conventional
   “state-of-the-art” PPV for detecting AFib is less than 59%^1. The PPV
   for Cardiologs’ detection of AFib was 91%^2 included in the cleared FDA
   submission. In addition, also as included in the cleared FDA
   submission, Cardiologs’ sensitivity for detecting AFib was reported to
   be 97%^3 (the percentage of positive cases truly identified) and was
   superior to “state-of-the-art” conventional methods of detecting AFib
   and other arrhythmias. Cardiologs’ study results have been published in
   the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology (2016, Vol. 23(2S 41-55).
   The study’s investigators concluded: “This (Cardiologs) method may be
   more reliable and accurate than previous methods in the diagnosis of
   AFib on long-duration ambulatory ECG and other monitoring devices.”

Première utilisation de Cardiologs en France

   11.07.2018

   L’Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud (ICPS) annonce la première
   utilisation en France de l’intelligence artificielle Cardiologs pour le
   diagnostic d’arythmies cardiaques par Holter ECG.

   L’équipe de cardiologie de l’ICPS (Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud)
   est un groupe de renommée mondiale, reconnu pour son engagement en
   faveur de l’innovation. L’ICPS est notamment spécialisé dans le
   diagnostic et le traitement des arythmies cardiaques, que l’on peut
   diagnostiquer par un enregistrement continu de l’activité électrique du
   cœur pendant plusieurs jours (appelé « électrocardiogramme ambulatoire
   » ou « Holter ECG »).

   Parmi la quinzaine d’arythmies détectables par Holter ECG, la
   fibrillation atriale est notamment un enjeu majeur de santé publique,
   car estimée être la cause d’un AVC sur trois. L’AVC (Accident
   Vasculaire Cérébral) est la première cause de handicap chez l’adulte,
   souvent responsable de séquelles lourdes. Chaque année, on dénombre
   près de 17 millions de nouveaux cas d’AVC dans le monde dont 150,000 en
   France.^1

   L’analyse de Holter ECG pose cependant problème car très chronophage
   pour les médecins, ce qui constitue un frein majeur au diagnostic des
   arythmies.

   Forte de son engagement en faveur de l’innovation, l’ICPS est devenue
   la première institution en France à intégrer dans sa pratique clinique
   la plateforme d’analyse des ECG ambulatoires développée par Cardiologs.
   L’utilisation de Cardiologs permet à l’ICPS d’analyser plus
   efficacement les enregistrements Holter ECG, ce qui a pour effet une
   amélioration de la pratique et des bénéfices pour le patient.

   La plateforme d’analyse ECG Cardiologs a été développée à Paris par une
   équipe internationale d’ingénieurs et chercheurs en intelligence
   artificielle aux côtés de cardiologues experts de l’ECG. L’algorithme
   mis au point par Cardiologs a été entraîné à partir d’une base de
   données de plus de 600,000 ECG et continue de progresser au fur et à
   mesure que la base de données s’enrichit.

   La technologie innovante de Cardiologs rentre parfaitement dans le
   cadre de l’engagement de l’ICPS pour l’innovation dans la pratique
   clinique. L’intelligence artificielle a le potentiel de transformer la
   santé pour améliorer le service rendu à nos patients. » dit le Dr
   Laurent Fiorina, cardiologue à l’ICPS, et qui a participé au
   développement de Cardiologs.

   C’est un privilège pour Cardiologs de nouer ce partenariat avec une
   institution de renom telle que l’ICPS, et je pense que l’adoption de
   Cardiologs par cette équipe valide encore davantage l’utilité et
   l’intérêt de notre solution en pratique clinique » dit Yann Fleureau,
   co-fondateur et PDG de Cardiologs.

Cardiologs Raises $6.4M Series A

   05.10.2017

   Company’s cloud-based and Artificial Intelligence-powered ECG analysis
   solution assists healthcare professionals in screening for heart
   diseases.

   Cardiologs Technologies announced today that it has raised $6.4 million
   in a Series A financing with a syndicate of life science and technology
   investors (Idinvest, ISAI, Kurma Partners, Partech Ventures) and with
   continued support and participation from current investor Bpifrance
   seed fund (F3A). This round brings total funding of Cardiologs to $10
   million. Proceeds will be dedicated to fast-forward commercialisation
   of the Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform in the United States and
   Europe.“Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology”. “Ambulatory ECG analysis and reporting is a
   labor-intensive process that can result in delays for arrhythmia
   detection and increased costs,” said Yann Fleureau, co-founder and CEO
   of Cardiologs Technologies. “Our Cardiologs team has trained a neural
   network using more than 500,000 recordings, and this training dataset
   keeps growing,” said Fleureau. “The result is that Cardiologs is
   designed to recognise patterns in a cardiac signal for fast and precise
   analysis of heart diseases in a similar intuitive manner as expert
   cardiologists,” said Fleureau.In July 2017, Cardiologs announced FDA
   clearance of its Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform, an ECG- analysis web
   solution powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cardiologs assists
   physicians in screening for 10 arrhythmias including Atrial
   Fibrillation (AFib) using ambulatory ECG monitoring recordings.

   Why solving Ambulatory ECG analysis is important
     * Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is the most common human arrhythmia,
       affecting about 33 million patients worldwide. AFib is a growing
       problem in cardiovascular disease and is associated with an
       increased risk of severe stroke, heart failure, and death.^1
     * AFib is often asymptomatic and silent with stroke as the first
       manifestation. Recent stroke registries indicate that AFib is
       associated with one-third of all ischemic strokes.
     * The Ambulatory ECG records continuously the electrical activity of
       the heart (ECG) up to a few weeks. It is the gold standard
       examination to detect AFib and other arrhythmias (for example
       bradycardia, which is a cause of syncope).
     * The Ambulatory ECG analysis aims to detect the episodes of
       arrhythmia. Only a few minutes of arrhythmia can occur during a
       whole week of recording, making the process labor- intensive.
     * Solving ambulatory ECG analysis results in significant cost-savings
       for the healthcare system, earlier diagnostic and decreased risk of
       stroke for the patient, time savings and increased performance for
       the healthcare professional.

   How Cardiologs works
     * A cardiologist recovers a digital ECG from any compatible ECG
       device — such as a Holter monitor, smartwatch, ECG patch or even a
       connected t-shirt—then uploads it to the Cardiologs cloud and is
       able to immediately leverage our technology to identify relevant
       events.
     * It is especially powerful for long-term recordings that require
       today a very laborious manual analysis process.
     * ECG monitoring product and service companies can also benefit from
       Cardiologs in just three lines of code via the company’s web API.

   Availability in Europe and the United States

   The Cardiologs solution is CE-marked and has been approved to detect up
   to 100 cardiac abnormalities in Europe. Currently, the detection of 10
   significant arrhythmias is available in the United States, which covers
   most clinical cases of ambulatory ECG monitoring. The company plans to
   further extend its AI capacity beyond ECG diagnostics claims.

   Supporting quotes

   “Cardiologs is the perfect example of applying state-of-the-art machine
   learning techniques to help professionals work much faster and more
   accurately. And in this case, it can save a lot of lives,” said Benoist
   Grossmann, Managing Partner at Idinvest.J-David Chamboredon, CEO of
   ISAI, added: “Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology.””Cardiologs has assembled a world-class team with a unique
   combination of mathematical and engineering skills,” said Reza
   Malekzadeh, General Partner at Partech Ventures. “It is great to see
   them out to solve a global problem with a solution that will bring
   better healthcare to a greater number at a more affordable cost.”

   Scientific Validation of Cardiologs

   When defining the reliability of diagnosing AFib and other arrhythmias,
   the term Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers to the percentage of
   true positive cases among total cases detected. Conventional “state-of-
   the-art” PPV for detecting AFib is less than 59%[1]. The PPV for
   Cardiologs’ detection of AFib was 91%[2] included in the cleared FDA
   submission. In addition, also as included in the cleared FDA
   submission, Cardiologs’ sensitivity for detecting AFib was reported to
   be 97%[3] (the percentage of positive cases truly identified) and was
   superior to “state-of-the-art” conventional methods of detecting AFib
   and other arrhythmias. Cardiologs’ study results have been published in

Première utilisation de Cardiologs en France

   11.07.2018

   L’Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud (ICPS) annonce la première
   utilisation en France de l’intelligence artificielle Cardiologs pour le
   diagnostic d’arythmies cardiaques par Holter ECG.

   L’équipe de cardiologie de l’ICPS (Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud)
   est un groupe de renommée mondiale, reconnu pour son engagement en
   faveur de l’innovation. L’ICPS est notamment spécialisé dans le
   diagnostic et le traitement des arythmies cardiaques, que l’on peut
   diagnostiquer par un enregistrement continu de l’activité électrique du
   cœur pendant plusieurs jours (appelé « électrocardiogramme ambulatoire
   » ou « Holter ECG »).

   Parmi la quinzaine d’arythmies détectables par Holter ECG, la
   fibrillation atriale est notamment un enjeu majeur de santé publique,
   car estimée être la cause d’un AVC sur trois. L’AVC (Accident
   Vasculaire Cérébral) est la première cause de handicap chez l’adulte,
   souvent responsable de séquelles lourdes. Chaque année, on dénombre
   près de 17 millions de nouveaux cas d’AVC dans le monde dont 150,000 en
   France.^1

   L’analyse de Holter ECG pose cependant problème car très chronophage
   pour les médecins, ce qui constitue un frein majeur au diagnostic des
   arythmies.

   Forte de son engagement en faveur de l’innovation, l’ICPS est devenue
   la première institution en France à intégrer dans sa pratique clinique
   la plateforme d’analyse des ECG ambulatoires développée par Cardiologs.
   L’utilisation de Cardiologs permet à l’ICPS d’analyser plus
   efficacement les enregistrements Holter ECG, ce qui a pour effet une
   amélioration de la pratique et des bénéfices pour le patient.

   La plateforme d’analyse ECG Cardiologs a été développée à Paris par une
   équipe internationale d’ingénieurs et chercheurs en intelligence
   artificielle aux côtés de cardiologues experts de l’ECG. L’algorithme
   mis au point par Cardiologs a été entraîné à partir d’une base de
   données de plus de 600,000 ECG et continue de progresser au fur et à
   mesure que la base de données s’enrichit.

   La technologie innovante de Cardiologs rentre parfaitement dans le
   cadre de l’engagement de l’ICPS pour l’innovation dans la pratique
   clinique. L’intelligence artificielle a le potentiel de transformer la
   santé pour améliorer le service rendu à nos patients. » dit le Dr
   Laurent Fiorina, cardiologue à l’ICPS, et qui a participé au
   développement de Cardiologs.

   C’est un privilège pour Cardiologs de nouer ce partenariat avec une
   institution de renom telle que l’ICPS, et je pense que l’adoption de
   Cardiologs par cette équipe valide encore davantage l’utilité et
   l’intérêt de notre solution en pratique clinique » dit Yann Fleureau,
   co-fondateur et PDG de Cardiologs.

Cardiologs Raises $6.4M Series A

   05.10.2017

   Company’s cloud-based and Artificial Intelligence-powered ECG analysis
   solution assists healthcare professionals in screening for heart
   diseases.

   Cardiologs Technologies announced today that it has raised $6.4 million
   in a Series A financing with a syndicate of life science and technology
   investors (Idinvest, ISAI, Kurma Partners, Partech Ventures) and with
   continued support and participation from current investor Bpifrance
   seed fund (F3A). This round brings total funding of Cardiologs to $10
   million. Proceeds will be dedicated to fast-forward commercialisation
   of the Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform in the United States and
   Europe.“Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology”. “Ambulatory ECG analysis and reporting is a
   labor-intensive process that can result in delays for arrhythmia
   detection and increased costs,” said Yann Fleureau, co-founder and CEO
   of Cardiologs Technologies. “Our Cardiologs team has trained a neural
   network using more than 500,000 recordings, and this training dataset
   keeps growing,” said Fleureau. “The result is that Cardiologs is
   designed to recognise patterns in a cardiac signal for fast and precise
   analysis of heart diseases in a similar intuitive manner as expert
   cardiologists,” said Fleureau.In July 2017, Cardiologs announced FDA
   clearance of its Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform, an ECG- analysis web
   solution powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cardiologs assists
   physicians in screening for 10 arrhythmias including Atrial
   Fibrillation (AFib) using ambulatory ECG monitoring recordings.

   Why solving Ambulatory ECG analysis is important
     * Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is the most common human arrhythmia,
       affecting about 33 million patients worldwide. AFib is a growing
       problem in cardiovascular disease and is associated with an
       increased risk of severe stroke, heart failure, and death.^1
     * AFib is often asymptomatic and silent with stroke as the first
       manifestation. Recent stroke registries indicate that AFib is
       associated with one-third of all ischemic strokes.
     * The Ambulatory ECG records continuously the electrical activity of
       the heart (ECG) up to a few weeks. It is the gold standard
       examination to detect AFib and other arrhythmias (for example
       bradycardia, which is a cause of syncope).
     * The Ambulatory ECG analysis aims to detect the episodes of
       arrhythmia. Only a few minutes of arrhythmia can occur during a
       whole week of recording, making the process labor- intensive.
     * Solving ambulatory ECG analysis results in significant cost-savings
       for the healthcare system, earlier diagnostic and decreased risk of
       stroke for the patient, time savings and increased performance for
       the healthcare professional.

   How Cardiologs works
     * A cardiologist recovers a digital ECG from any compatible ECG
       device — such as a Holter monitor, smartwatch, ECG patch or even a
       connected t-shirt—then uploads it to the Cardiologs cloud and is
       able to immediately leverage our technology to identify relevant
       events.
     * It is especially powerful for long-term recordings that require
       today a very laborious manual analysis process.
     * ECG monitoring product and service companies can also benefit from
       Cardiologs in just three lines of code via the company’s web API.

   Availability in Europe and the United States

   The Cardiologs solution is CE-marked and has been approved to detect up
   to 100 cardiac abnormalities in Europe. Currently, the detection of 10
   significant arrhythmias is available in the United States, which covers
   most clinical cases of ambulatory ECG monitoring. The company plans to
   further extend its AI capacity beyond ECG diagnostics claims.

   Supporting quotes

   “Cardiologs is the perfect example of applying state-of-the-art machine
   learning techniques to help professionals work much faster and more
   accurately. And in this case, it can save a lot of lives,” said Benoist
   Grossmann, Managing Partner at Idinvest.J-David Chamboredon, CEO of
   ISAI, added: “Cardiologs’ fundamentals are outstanding. Its ability to
   combine deep learning and medical expertise can usher a new era for
   cardiology.””Cardiologs has assembled a world-class team with a unique
   combination of mathematical and engineering skills,” said Reza
   Malekzadeh, General Partner at Partech Ventures. “It is great to see
   them out to solve a global problem with a solution that will bring
   better healthcare to a greater number at a more affordable cost.”

   Scientific Validation of Cardiologs

   When defining the reliability of diagnosing AFib and other arrhythmias,
   the term Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers to the percentage of
   true positive cases among total cases detected. Conventional “state-of-
   the-art” PPV for detecting AFib is less than 59%[1]. The PPV for
   Cardiologs’ detection of AFib was 91%[2] included in the cleared FDA
   submission. In addition, also as included in the cleared FDA
   submission, Cardiologs’ sensitivity for detecting AFib was reported to
   be 97%[3] (the percentage of positive cases truly identified) and was
   superior to “state-of-the-art” conventional methods of detecting AFib
   and other arrhythmias. Cardiologs’ study results have been published in
   the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology (2016, Vol. 23(2S 41-55).
   The study’s investigators concluded: “This (Cardiologs) method may be
   more reliable and accurate than previous methods in the diagnosis of
   AFib on long-duration ambulatory ECG and other monitoring devices”.

Cardiologs Receives FDA Clearance

   05.07.2017

   Cardiologs is the world’s most advanced cloud-based and Artificial
   Intelligence-powered ECG analysis solution to aid healthcare
   professionals in screening for arrhythmias such as AFib using
   ambulatory ECG monitoring recordings.

   Cardiologs Technologies SAS announced today that it has received FDA
   clearance of its Cardiologs ECG Analysis Platform, a cloud-based
   cardiac monitoring-analysis web service powered by artificial
   intelligence (AI). Cardiologs aids physicians in screening for atrial
   fibrillation (AFib) and other arrhythmias using long-term ambulatory
   ECG monitoring recordings. The Cardiologs system is also CE-marked in
   Europe.

   “This (Cardiologs) method may be more reliable and accurate than
   previous methods in the diagnosis of AFib on long-duration ambulatory
   ECG and other monitoring devices.”

   Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common human arrhythmia,
   affecting about 33 million patients worldwide. AFib is a growing
   problem in cardiovascular disease and is associated with an increased
   risk of severe stroke, heart failure, and death. AFib is often
   asymptomatic, with stroke as the first manifestation. Indeed, recent
   stroke registries indicate that AFib is associated with one-third of
   all ischemic strokes.

   “It is intuitive that screening for AFib and subsequent anticoagulant
   treatment should reduce the stroke burden, which is the basis of
   guideline recommendations to screen for AFib in persons over the age of
   65,” said Dr. Arnaud Rosier, cardiac electrophysiologist at the Hôpital
   Jacques Cartier, Massy. “Unfortunately, current R-R interval based
   methods to detect AFib are characterised by an inferior Positive
   Predictive Value (PPV) of under 59%, leading to misdiagnoses, mostly
   false positives, that add significant cost to the healthcare system
   while burdening healthcare resources and placing unnecessary stress on
   misdiagnosed patients or putting undiagnosed patients in harm’s way.”

   “Cardiologs is a game-changer for arrhythmia screening,” added Yann
   Fleureau, co-founder and CEO of Cardiologs Technologies. “A
   cardiologist recovers a digital ECG from any compatible cardiac
   monitoring device—such as a Holter monitor, smartwatch, ECG patch or
   even a connected t-shirt—then uploads it to the Cardiologs cloud and is
   able to immediately leverage our technology to identify relevant
   events. It is especially powerful for long-term recordings that used to
   require a very laborious manual analysis process.

   “Our Cardiologs team has trained a neural network using more than
   500,000 recordings, and this training dataset keeps growing,” said
   Fleureau. “The result is that Cardiologs is designed to recognise
   patterns in a cardiac signal for fast and precise analysis of
   arrhythmias such as AFib in a similar intuitive manner as expert
   cardiologists. We especially bring the P-wave detection (atrial
   activity) to a whole new level, which explains our radically better
   PPV,” said Fleureau.

   Scientific Validation of Cardiologs

   When defining the reliability of diagnosing AFib and other arrhythmias,
   the term Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers to the percentage of
   true positive cases among total cases detected. Conventional
   “state-of-the-art” PPV for detecting AFib is less than 59%^1. The PPV
   for Cardiologs’ detection of AFib was 91%^2 included in the cleared FDA
   submission. In addition, also as included in the cleared FDA
   submission, Cardiologs’ sensitivity for detecting AFib was reported to
   be 97%^3 (the percentage of positive cases truly identified) and was
   superior to “state-of-the-art” conventional methods of detecting AFib
   and other arrhythmias. Cardiologs’ study results have been published in
   the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology (2016, Vol. 23(2S 41-55).
   The study’s investigators concluded: “This (Cardiologs) method may be
   more reliable and accurate than previous methods in the diagnosis of
   AFib on long-duration ambulatory ECG and other monitoring devices.”
