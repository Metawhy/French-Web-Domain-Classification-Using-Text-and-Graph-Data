Lauryn in front of Tegenungan waterfall in Ubud Bali Welcome to LE Travels
Travel Blog!

   I’m Lauryn, a travel blogger living in Atlanta, Georgia. Traveling is a
   passion of mine and I enjoy exploring the world as much as I can in
   between my full-time job.

   LE Travels started as a way for me and my husband to remember all of
   the small details of our trips. I slowly realized how helpful these
   posts could be to other travelers and decided to share them with the
   world. I hope these stories and advice pieces fill you with enough
   wanderlust to get out there and see more of this beautiful Earth.

   Traveling is not something we do, it’s something we experience. I
   believe traveling can change your life in more ways than you could ever
   possibly imagine. I know it has for me. I am a stronger, more
   confident, and more open-minded person thanks to all the places and
   cultures I’ve been able to experience.

   Learn more about me here

   -Bisous!
