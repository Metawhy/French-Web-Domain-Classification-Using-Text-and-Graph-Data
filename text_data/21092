   "At a time when rock ‘n’ roll, the sexual revolution and the anti-war
   counterculture all intersected, Mr. Smith spoke to seemingly every
   boldface name."    -The New York Times

   Come say!

   A great review in PopMatters just came out- Check it out!

   Here's its conclusion:

     Through it all, The Smith Tapes 1969-1972 is a fascinating,
     endlessly readable set of transcripts that read as a sort of
     proto-podcast. That it contains interviews with some of the most
     influential and culturally significant figures of the era discussing
     the work and events for which they would ultimately become best
     known makes The Smith Tapes an indispensable cultural artifact. Like
     his reporting at the time, these interviews offer first-person
     accounts direct from the front lines, delivered in real time and
     without the memory clouding ability of hindsight. To read these
     conversations is to be transported directly into the culture of the
     times. Essential.

The Podcast- Episode 3: John & Yoko's Bed-In

   45 years ago this week, John & Yoko held their Bed-In in Montreal to
   promote Peace. Knowing that they  were magnets for the press, the
   newlyweds idea was to exploit their fame for a good cause. They held
   court for a week in the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, being interviewed by
   scores of journalists for 12 hours a day, all the while laying in bed.
   Howard spoke to them twice that week on the phone from NYC.

The Podcast- Episode 2: George Harrison

   44 years ago to the day, George Harrison sat down with Howard Smith for
   an interview in NYC. Harrison was only in town for a week, but took the
   time to have this incredible conversation about the Beatles' break-up
   (just 2 weeks earlier), being held back by Paul, his own songwriting
   and plans for his upcoming solo album. That album, "All Things Must
   Pass," will turn out to be hugely successful, holding no. 1 on the
   charts for 7 weeks.

The Podcast- Episode 1

Lou Reed

   This month celebrates what would have been Lou Reed's 72nd birthday. It
   also marks the 45th anniversary of his interview with Howard Smith
   (March 26, 1969). It was a rare interview to say the least,
   finding Reed upon the release of the Velvet Underground's incredible
   3rd album (The Velvet Underground)  and in the midst of a sobriety
   kick.
   In the podcast we also hear from Howard Smith himself, who talks about
   his experiences with Reed at the time.
