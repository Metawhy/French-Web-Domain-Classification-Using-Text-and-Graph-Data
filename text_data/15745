To Our Blogroll Followers

Friday, August 5, 2011

   Hi everyone,
   Some of you may have noticed that you haven't seen any updates from
   Cake Wrecks in a few days and I wanted to give you a heads up. On
   Friday night, Cake Wrecks moved to a new host and will no longer be
   publishing on blogspot. So, if you'd still like to receive updates from
   us, simply change the settings in your blogroll to read cakewrecks.com
   or cakewrecks.squarespace.com instead of cakewrecks.blogspot.com.
   That's it!
   Thanks so much for reading and Wreck On!
   john (the hubby of Jen)

What's a Wreck?

What's a Wreck?

   A Cake Wreck is any cake that is unintentionally sad, silly, creepy,
   inappropriate - you name it. A Wreck is not necessarily a poorly-made
   cake; it's simply one I find funny, for any of a number of reasons.
   Anyone who has ever smeared frosting on a baked good has made a Wreck
   at one time or another, so I'm not here to vilify decorators: Cake
   Wrecks is just about finding the funny in unexpected, sugar-filled
   places.

   Now, don't you have a photo you want to send me? ;)

                                                                     - Jen

Where's the book?

   We don’t have any copies of Cake Wrecks for sale here, autographed or
   otherwise. We decided the shipping and handling costs would be too high
   to make it worth your while. So instead, buy your copies locally or
   online and then order personalized bookplates: it’s cheaper, easier,
   and I think even looks a bit nicer.

Ordering Info

   Payments must be made through Paypal, which accepts all major credit
   cards. Sorry, but that means no checks or MOs or barter-based chickens.

   We ship everything first class USPS, and will do our best to have your
   package in the mail within 2 days of your order.
