Here's Even More Audio of Shane Gillis From ‘Saturday Night Live’ Gleefully
Saying Slurs

While the YouTube video has since been made private, the audio footage from
the May 2019 recording of 'Real Ass Podcast' remains online.

   Newly anointed Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis called
   Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang a "Jew c---k" in a
   podcast episode recorded in May of this year. The episode of Real Ass
   Podcast, hosted by comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico, was
   previously accessible in a YouTube video that has since been made
   private. The episode's audio, however, is still available online.

   illis-comedian-podcast-the-newest-hire-on-saturday-night-live?utm_sourc
   e=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjwxxw&site=vice

   Gillis's hiring as one of SNL's new featured players was announced on
   Thursday. He came under fire within hours over racist and homophobic
   slurs in episodes of his own podcast, co-hosted with Matt McCusker,
   recorded last year. He released a statement that night describing
   himself as "a comedian who pushes boundaries" but sometimes misses.
   "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything
   I've said," Gillis wrote. "My intention is never to hurt anyone but I
   am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires
   risks."

   Gillis took several of those "risks" in the Real Ass Podcast episode,
   number 402, recorded on Memorial Day 2019. The reference to Yang
   revolves around a callback to a moment earlier in the episode, around
   46 minutes and 30 seconds in. In that segment, Gomez riffs about a
   candy he describes as a small wax bottle containing an unsatisfying
   amount of sweet liquid (he appears to be describing the Nik-L-Lip).
   "What a fuckin' scam that was," he says. He starts to say, "whoever
   came up with that is the—" when Gillis jumps in and says "c----s." The
   entire group—Gomez, Amico, Gillis, and comic Mike Figs—appears to erupt
   in laughter, and one of the comics sings "ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-c----s" over
   a drum sting. "Shane Gillis crushing it with a one-word racist
   punchline," Gomez says. "One of my favorites."

   Gillis's subsequent use of the slur occurs around one hour and six
   minutes into the episode. The comics are riffing about Bernie Sanders,
   whom Gillis describes as Mario to Dick Cheney's Wario. The riff
   descends into awkwardness, and Gillis says his Wario joke was the best
   joke of the episode. Gomez responds, "your c---k line was 40 times
   better." Some cross-talk ensues in which Gillis remarks on his frequent
   use of that slur, before directing it to Sanders: "That Jew c---k?
   Commie Jew c---k? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems.
   Jew c---k, next. Actually, they are running a Jew c---k—Chang, dude."
   Then the conversation turns to author and life coach Tony Robbins.

   These were not the only instances of hateful language directed toward
   Asian people in the episode. About an hour in, the group prepares for a
   segment in which they watch a random podcast; in this case, their
   producer has chosen the video podcast "Make Money Travel Blogging
   Featuring Jacob Fu." Upon learning the name, the group, led by Gillis,
   breaks out into exaggerated Chinese accents. When the video starts
   playing, Gillis exclaims, "I was making fun of these guys for being
   Asian—they're so hot. Look at these hot guys, dude… he speaks so much
   better than all of us." He chides one of his fellow comics to stop
   speaking in a mocking accent. "Now it's very racist. These guys speak
   great, they're handsome… Those are nice handsome boys having fun."

   Then Gillis appears to start describing the group. "Fat ugly idiots
   promoting hate, that's what this is," he says. "That's what this is?"
   Gomez responds. "Yeah, look at all of us," Gillis says. "We're all
   shitty people. At least those Asians were having fun."

   VICE has reached out to Gillis and NBC for comment.

A Guide to VH1's Drunk, Loud, Unapologetic Golden Age of Reality TV

'Flavor of 'Rock of Love,' 'Flavor of Love,' 'I Love New York,' and others
are on Prime, so it's time to revisit Somethin's staircase poop.

   Credit: VH1

   Amazon did a great service recently when they made almost the entire
   catalog of VH1's mid- to late-00s reality TV series available to stream
   on Prime. Spanning roughly from 2006 to 2010, a time period which
   yielded such glorious shows as Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love
   New York, this is, undoubtedly, an opportunity to re-immerse oneself in
   the golden era of trash television. Without these now-classic shows,
   the world would never know Tiffany "New York" Pollard, the most GIFable
   queen of the entire internet. It would never learn that "people who eat
   basil are lame," or that "stripper shoes go with any outfit," among
   other gems of wisdom from Rock of Love Bus's glorious (and often
   wasted) cast member Ashley Klarich. Truly, this earth would have been
   worse off had it never been privy to Tykeisha "Somethin" Thomas from
   Flavor of Love season 2 infamously defecating on the staircase after a
   clock ceremony (more on this later), or Nikki taking a test-tube shot
   out of Gia's vagina on Rock of Love. These contestants and their
   hijinks were far from the Hannahs and Laurens of The Bachelor universe,
   unafraid to let their freak flags wave, get laid, get drunk, be loud,
   and drag each other ruthlessly.

   While there's now an entire universe of 90 Day Fiancé and more than
   half a dozen Real Housewives franchises fulfilling our raccoon-like
   need to devour absolute garbage, VH1's staple lineup of 00s reality TV
   just hit differently. These shows were unhinged in strange and
   hilarious ways, and remain endlessly quotable, memeable, and, now,
   nostalgic for reality TV fans. These characters' willingness to go to
   astronomical levels of absurdity and all-out, televised chaos for the
   object of their (heavily staged) affection remains mesmerizing,
   undoubtedly egged on by producers and accentuated by editors' additions
   of tongue-in-cheek sound and visual effects (like Flavor of Love's
   Hottie getting a bike chime noise every time she blinked her big, false
   lashes at someone).

   Now, years after their sell-by date, we can joyously revisit these
   wonderfully subversive pieces of reality TV perfection. Here's a
   helpful guide to VH1's greatest shows, all of which embody the wildness
   of an abandoned amusement park run by feral badgers.

If it's rap legends, boss bitches, and bodily fluids you crave, get a taste
of Flavor of Love.

   After his breakup with 80s actress Brigitte Nielsen (their relationship
   was documented in the aptly titled series Strange Love, a spin-off of
   The Surreal Life), VH1 producers gave Public Enemy's Flavor Flav the
   chance to find The One on Flavor of Love, a dating series that parodied
   The Bachelor. Unlike The Bachelor, however, the series featured a
   racially diverse cast of women vying for one of Flav's trademark clocks
   to wear around their necks, signifying that they would advance to the
   next round. While many Black writers called out the show for being
   exploitative and perpetuating offensive stereotypes, the series was a
   ratings beast that lasted three seasons and led to multiple spinoffs,
   and the women that stepped into Flav's mansion became some of the
   greatest contestants in reality TV history thanks to their
   unapologetic, unadulterated personalities. They kept it real at all
   times, leading to scenes and lines that are still fondly memorialized
   on the internet to this day. There was Hottie's assurance that everyone
   says she reminds them of Beyoncé; Pumkin launching a spit missile at
   New York; the aforementioned poop on the staircase incident (Somethin
   explained that she tried to hold it, but her stomach said, "Bitch,
   you've got me fucked up;" Flav then applauded Somethin for being "real
   with it"); and too many moments from Tiffany "New York" Pollard to
   count. For two seasons, New York ran the other women ragged,
   implementing grade-A trash talk, stare-downs, and fearlessness in
   pursuit of her man Flav. Her iconic level of drama rendered her worthy
   of various spin-offs, a Brooklyn art show of works created in her
   honor, and a throne as the reigning as the queen of reaction GIFs.
   Every minute of television where the camera is on New York is worth the
   watch.

   Watch on: Seasons 1 and 3 on Amazon Prime, Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu

If you stan stripper heels, giant breast implants, and hair teased to the
heavens, look no further than Rock of Love.

   yle-from-bret-michaelss-girls-on-bars?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com
   &utm_campaign=ywa5ey&site=vice

   For three seasons, Bret Michaels—best known as the lead singer of
   hair-metal band Poison and the co-star of Pamela Anderson's
   lesser-known sex tape—searched America (and whatever part of France the
   extremely horny Angelique is from) to find his tour bus partner for
   life. The incessantly sloppy-drunk contestants came in hot, armed with
   an arsenal of clear heels, ass-cheek-grazing polyester dresses, and an
   insatiable desire to make out with Bret Michaels. But they were more
   than Sunset Strip groupies, strippers, and porn stars; they were women
   on a mission to get their man (and some screen time). There were
   standouts from all three seasons, like the big-haired, 80s metal
   goddess Heather, who got Michaels's name tattooed on her neck; the
   cackling, painfully earnest cowgirl Rodeo; and mean girl Ashley, whose
   magnificent implants and the way she said "bitch" made her extra
   larger-than-life. But those women were just a few in a kaleidoscope of
   big personalities, including one contestant who took everyone's used
   socks after a hockey match to keep for her personal use. In the end,
   Bret never found his true match, but the search yielded hours of
   premium entertainment.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

You love Tiffany Pollard? Then you'll definitely love I Love New York.

   After two unsuccessful efforts to win Flav's final clock, Pollard
   landed a spin-off dating show of her own. For two seasons, Pollard and
   her frighteningly brutal mom, Sister Patterson, put a group of studs
   and duds through the absolute ringer as they pledged their undying love
   for New York. Within that group were some standouts that made for
   excellent television, like excruciatingly dweeby white boy Mr. Boston,
   mouthy "stallionaire" Chance, his more tender brother Real (who
   tragically died of colon cancer in 2015), outspoken little person
   Midget Mac, Italian mama's boy Frank the Entertainer, and countless
   others. There was toe sucking, speedo wearing, a pretty bad nosebleed,
   and a fervent church service led by Sister Patterson. It was worth
   watching for Pollard's electrifying presence alone, but became a true
   carnival thanks to the full cast and their antics.

   Watch on: Hulu

If dudes who look like Criss Angel get you going, pick Daisy of Love.

   Rock of Love season 2 runner-up Daisy de la Hoya (yes, she is related
   to boxer Oscar de la Hoya) didn't leave with the man of her rock 'n'
   roll dreams. But the heavily lip-plumped rock chick did score her own
   one-season spin-off in which 20 dudes that look like they ransacked
   Dave Navarro's closet fought for her affection. The show also featured
   a set of glammed-out triplets who claimed to be Swedish rock stars in a
   band called Snake of Eden and enjoyed eating raw hot dogs out of the
   package. It's a leather-cuff and nautical-star tornado in there, and
   it's gold.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

If it's a group of lingerie-clad women flipping off outdated ideas of
respectability you like, go with Charm School.

   Charm School sought to do the impossible: reform the hard-partying and
   harder-fighting women from Flavor of Love and Rock of Love, and turn
   them into polite, well-behaved ladies. It did so in grossly outdated
   ways, like telling the women to dress and behave less sexually. But the
   ladies fought back in every possible way, finding it hard to leave
   their boozing, trash-talking, and wearing-lingerie-as-outerwear ways
   behind them. (Bless them for that.) Hosted by Mo'Nique, Sharon
   Osbourne, and Ricki Lake in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the show
   saw contestants forced to perform challenges aimed at molding them into
   business-savvy, self-sufficient women, and in some cases, contestants
   seemed to actually care about evolving into better versions of
   themselves. But many others weren't even trying, and the show will be
   forever remembered as the one where Osbourne beat up aspiring trophy
   wife Megan Hauserman after she insulted Ozzy Osbourne during the season
   2 reunion. Not the most charming moment.

That Iconic Pic of Phoebe Waller-Bridge Smoking Was Almost Blocked by Amazon

"Smoking is always off-limits," a source reportedly said.

   The 2019 Emmys were mostly a wonky mess full of awkward TikTok jokes
   and terrifying Meryl Streep masks, but at least one genuinely good
   thing came out of it: that truly blessed image of Fleabag's Phoebe
   Waller-Bridge chilling so hard after winning a zillion much-deserved
   Emmys. The world collectively lost its mind when BBC comedy head Josh
   Cole tweeted it out last week, and since then, it has circulated
   nonstop with a million different captions about its aspirational
   qualities. But regardless, let's just take a minute and soak it in once
   again, because the sheer awesome power of the image has yet to lose its
   luster:

   It is a vibe worthy of at least an Emmy nomination on its own, but
   according to Hollywood Reporter, we almost didn't get to see it at
   all—because, apparently, Amazon doesn't approve of its stars smoking.

   Sources told the THR that Amazon was on-hand during that fateful
   Chateau Marmont afterparty, and already successfully foiled a few
   photographers from taking pictures of Waller-Bridge as she celebrated
   her post-Emmys win by ripping a cig. Luckily, the Amazon folks weren't
   fast enough to stop Cole from shooting his shot, but THR's source
   imagines the studio isn't exactly happy about it.

   com&utm_campaign=8xwvex&site=vice

   "I'm sure people are upset that [Cole's] photo made it out," the source
   said, according to Hollywood Reporter. "Smoking is always off-limits.
   But she was having fun and acting carefree."

   If by "having fun and acting carefree" the source meant "elegantly
   basking in the kind of meteoric success that the rest of us can only
   dream of," then, yes, that seems right. We common plebes are all lucky
   that Cole managed to evade the Amazon wet blankets and deliver us this
   sacred photo.

   Thank you for your service, Cole. The world needed to bare witness to
   such a blessed moment. We are forever grateful.

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.
   Advertisement

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   Enter executive producer Quincy Jones and a pilot for a new
   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still
   more acting experience than Will Smith had at the time—Parsons nabbed
   the role of Hilary Banks.

The princess of Bel-Air

   We owe the existence of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Will Smith's tax
   problems. Nearly bankrupt and millions in debt to the IRS after his
   early musical success, Smith jumped at the chance for a steady,
   lucrative gig. For the first three seasons, 70 percent of his TV
   paychecks went straight to the government.

   While the NBC sitcom took time to find its ratings footing (by its
   third season, it was America's most popular show with an all-Black
   cast), its stars clicked instantly.

   "I suddenly had a sister [Tatyana Ali], I had a little brother [Alfonso
   Ribeiro], Will was like a brother," Parsons says. "Even the crew was
   like family. Everyone embraced each other and cared about each other.
   Even if it stopped right with the pilot, it would have still been a
   life-changing experience for me."

   Perhaps most crucially for Parsons was the arrival of a new father
   figure in the form of James Avery, the actor who played Uncle Phil. "He
   was so much like 'Dad.' He took that role very seriously on camera and
   off. My dad was not a typical dad, and James was," she says. "He was
   very affectionate and warm and always paid attention to who I was going
   out with, and if he saw them, he had to shake his finger in their face.
   He was great." (Avery died in 2013 at age 68 from complications
   following open heart surgery.)

   But in 1996, after six seasons and 148 episodes, NBC cancelled Fresh
   Prince and the close-knit cast went their separate ways. "It was
   devastating to suddenly be stripped away from them," says Parsons.
   "Everybody else went home to their families when it was over, and I
   pretty much went home to my two dogs and that was it."

More than one night at The Roxbury

   It took time for Parsons' new reality to set in. Virtually her entire
   adulthood had been spent cloaked in the comforting monotony of studio
   audience laughs and craft services lunches. Now, she found herself in a
   daze, and it took a run-in with her former junior-high friend Lenny
   Kravitz—whose mom had been a sitcom star on The Jeffersons—to shake her
   out of it.

   "I bumped into him not that long after Fresh Prince had been off, and
   he was the first person who looked at me and said, 'But how are you
   really doing?' Whether he meant it to laser in like that, it hit me,"
   she says. "It was the first time I really acknowledged that I wasn't
   doing that well. I was kind of tap dancing as fast as I could and not
   paying attention to the fact that it was a struggle."

   Meanwhile, substantial roles for women of color in the 90s were few and
   far between. During seasonal breaks on Fresh Prince, Parsons had
   managed to book films like Major Payne and Class Act but found it
   difficult to find decent projects even once freed of the hectic
   schedule of network TV.

   "There were a handful of actresses that were doing the work, and most
   of their names were Halle Berry," she laughs. "I was always like,
   'Halle got it again!' It seemed like there were so few roles and Halle
   was working like crazy, deservedly so."

   Parsons carved out her own opportunity in the form of a feminist sitcom
   called Lush Life that she co-created, produced, and starred in with pal
   Lori Petty. But the series premiered to dismal reviews (from mostly
   male critics) in September 1996, and after just four episodes aired,
   Fox pulled the plug.

   "It was a learning experience. Man, I learned so much doing that show,"
   Parsons says. "I've never worked so hard, but all of the new Fox
   comedies were taken off [when studio execs changed that year]. It
   didn't matter how well we had tested—because our show had tested really
   well—everything got yanked."

   Outside of work, Parsons and Petty became regulars at Hollywood's
   legendary Roxbury nightclub, known for its VIP clientele and celebrity
   drama.

   "I had a lot of fun times there, but there was also a lot of that
   chasing the dragon kind of thing," she says. "I remember it got to the
   point when Lori and I had worked out, and we'd show up at the Roxbury
   with our hair pulled up and no makeup in sweatpants and sneakers, and
   the bouncer would let us through, past everybody else, into the club.
   We had gotten so lazy about it. It was weird. All that shine was
   probably wearing off a little bit. You go expecting that same feeling,
   and then after a while, it's kind of like, why are we here?"

Starting over

   Advertisement

   Eager for a change of scenery, Parsons moved to New York and continued
   acting in films like Mixing Nia and The Ladies Man, as well as Denis
   Leary's short-lived 2001 detective comedy The Job. Her cross-country
   move also led her to her now-husband, filmmaker Alexandre Rockwell,
   whom she met at a mutual friend's restaurant opening. They married in
   2003, and welcomed a daughter named Lana that same year. Their son,
   Nico, followed in 2007.

   "My interests were changing," she says. "It became very difficult to do
   everything, to memorize lines for a part and have to get someone to
   last-minute watch the kids—to race across town and do all that, and if
   you got a call back, do it again. I'd find myself dropping the ball a
   lot."

   Parsons began focusing on writing, and in 2005 founded the non-profit
   organization Sweet Blackberry, aimed at educating children about
   little-known parts of African American history. The idea had been
   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."

Here's Even More Audio of Shane Gillis From ‘Saturday Night Live’ Gleefully
Saying Slurs

While the YouTube video has since been made private, the audio footage from
the May 2019 recording of 'Real Ass Podcast' remains online.

   This article originally appeared on VICE US

   Newly anointed Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis called
   Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang a "Jew c---k" in a
   podcast episode recorded in May of this year. The episode of Real Ass
   Podcast, hosted by comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico, was
   previously accessible in a YouTube video that has since been made
   private. The episode's audio, however, is still available online.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/43ka33/who-the-hell-is-shane-g
   illis-comedian-podcast-the-newest-hire-on-saturday-night-live?utm_sourc
   e=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjwxxw&site=vice

   Gillis's hiring as one of SNL's new featured players was announced on
   Thursday. He came under fire within hours over racist and homophobic
   slurs in episodes of his own podcast, co-hosted with Matt McCusker,
   recorded last year. He released a statement that night describing
   himself as "a comedian who pushes boundaries" but sometimes misses.
   "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything
   I've said," Gillis wrote. "My intention is never to hurt anyone but I
   am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires
   risks."

   Gillis took several of those "risks" in the Real Ass Podcast episode,
   number 402, recorded on Memorial Day 2019. The reference to Yang
   revolves around a callback to a moment earlier in the episode, around
   46 minutes and 30 seconds in. In that segment, Gomez riffs about a
   candy he describes as a small wax bottle containing an unsatisfying
   amount of sweet liquid (he appears to be describing the Nik-L-Lip).
   "What a fuckin' scam that was," he says. He starts to say, "whoever
   came up with that is the—" when Gillis jumps in and says "c----s." The
   entire group—Gomez, Amico, Gillis, and comic Mike Figs—appears to erupt
   in laughter, and one of the comics sings "ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-c----s" over
   a drum sting. "Shane Gillis crushing it with a one-word racist
   punchline," Gomez says. "One of my favorites."

   Gillis's subsequent use of the slur occurs around one hour and six
   minutes into the episode. The comics are riffing about Bernie Sanders,
   whom Gillis describes as Mario to Dick Cheney's Wario. The riff
   descends into awkwardness, and Gillis says his Wario joke was the best
   joke of the episode. Gomez responds, "your c---k line was 40 times
   better." Some cross-talk ensues in which Gillis remarks on his frequent
   use of that slur, before directing it to Sanders: "That Jew c---k?
   Commie Jew c---k? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems.
   Jew c---k, next. Actually, they are running a Jew c---k—Chang, dude."
   Then the conversation turns to author and life coach Tony Robbins.

   These were not the only instances of hateful language directed toward
   Asian people in the episode. About an hour in, the group prepares for a
   segment in which they watch a random podcast; in this case, their
   producer has chosen the video podcast "Make Money Travel Blogging
   Featuring Jacob Fu." Upon learning the name, the group, led by Gillis,
   breaks out into exaggerated Chinese accents. When the video starts
   playing, Gillis exclaims, "I was making fun of these guys for being
   Asian—they're so hot. Look at these hot guys, dude… he speaks so much
   better than all of us." He chides one of his fellow comics to stop
   speaking in a mocking accent. "Now it's very racist. These guys speak
   great, they're handsome… Those are nice handsome boys having fun."

   Then Gillis appears to start describing the group. "Fat ugly idiots
   promoting hate, that's what this is," he says. "That's what this is?"
   Gomez responds. "Yeah, look at all of us," Gillis says. "We're all
   shitty people. At least those Asians were having fun."

   VICE has reached out to Gillis and NBC for comment.

A Guide to VH1's Drunk, Loud, Unapologetic Golden Age of Reality TV

'Flavor of 'Rock of Love,' 'Flavor of Love,' 'I Love New York,' and others
are on Prime, so it's time to revisit Somethin's staircase poop.

   Credit: VH1

   Amazon did a great service recently when they made almost the entire
   catalog of VH1's mid- to late-00s reality TV series available to stream
   on Prime. Spanning roughly from 2006 to 2010, a time period which
   yielded such glorious shows as Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love
   New York, this is, undoubtedly, an opportunity to re-immerse oneself in
   the golden era of trash television. Without these now-classic shows,
   the world would never know Tiffany "New York" Pollard, the most GIFable
   queen of the entire internet. It would never learn that "people who eat
   basil are lame," or that "stripper shoes go with any outfit," among
   other gems of wisdom from Rock of Love Bus's glorious (and often
   wasted) cast member Ashley Klarich. Truly, this earth would have been
   worse off had it never been privy to Tykeisha "Somethin" Thomas from
   Flavor of Love season 2 infamously defecating on the staircase after a
   clock ceremony (more on this later), or Nikki taking a test-tube shot
   out of Gia's vagina on Rock of Love. These contestants and their
   hijinks were far from the Hannahs and Laurens of The Bachelor universe,
   unafraid to let their freak flags wave, get laid, get drunk, be loud,
   and drag each other ruthlessly.

   While there's now an entire universe of 90 Day Fiancé and more than
   half a dozen Real Housewives franchises fulfilling our raccoon-like
   need to devour absolute garbage, VH1's staple lineup of 00s reality TV
   just hit differently. These shows were unhinged in strange and
   hilarious ways, and remain endlessly quotable, memeable, and, now,
   nostalgic for reality TV fans. These characters' willingness to go to
   astronomical levels of absurdity and all-out, televised chaos for the
   object of their (heavily staged) affection remains mesmerizing,
   undoubtedly egged on by producers and accentuated by editors' additions
   of tongue-in-cheek sound and visual effects (like Flavor of Love's
   Hottie getting a bike chime noise every time she blinked her big, false
   lashes at someone).

   Now, years after their sell-by date, we can joyously revisit these
   wonderfully subversive pieces of reality TV perfection. Here's a
   helpful guide to VH1's greatest shows, all of which embody the wildness
   of an abandoned amusement park run by feral badgers.

If it's rap legends, boss bitches, and bodily fluids you crave, get a taste
of Flavor of Love.

   After his breakup with 80s actress Brigitte Nielsen (their relationship
   was documented in the aptly titled series Strange Love, a spin-off of
   The Surreal Life), VH1 producers gave Public Enemy's Flavor Flav the
   chance to find The One on Flavor of Love, a dating series that parodied
   The Bachelor. Unlike The Bachelor, however, the series featured a
   racially diverse cast of women vying for one of Flav's trademark clocks
   to wear around their necks, signifying that they would advance to the
   next round. While many Black writers called out the show for being
   exploitative and perpetuating offensive stereotypes, the series was a
   ratings beast that lasted three seasons and led to multiple spinoffs,
   and the women that stepped into Flav's mansion became some of the
   greatest contestants in reality TV history thanks to their
   unapologetic, unadulterated personalities. They kept it real at all
   times, leading to scenes and lines that are still fondly memorialized
   on the internet to this day. There was Hottie's assurance that everyone
   says she reminds them of Beyoncé; Pumkin launching a spit missile at
   New York; the aforementioned poop on the staircase incident (Somethin
   explained that she tried to hold it, but her stomach said, "Bitch,
   you've got me fucked up;" Flav then applauded Somethin for being "real
   with it"); and too many moments from Tiffany "New York" Pollard to
   count. For two seasons, New York ran the other women ragged,
   implementing grade-A trash talk, stare-downs, and fearlessness in
   pursuit of her man Flav. Her iconic level of drama rendered her worthy
   of various spin-offs, a Brooklyn art show of works created in her
   honor, and a throne as the reigning as the queen of reaction GIFs.
   Every minute of television where the camera is on New York is worth the
   watch.

   Watch on: Seasons 1 and 3 on Amazon Prime, Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu

If you stan stripper heels, giant breast implants, and hair teased to the
heavens, look no further than Rock of Love.

   yle-from-bret-michaelss-girls-on-bars?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com
   &utm_campaign=ywa5ey&site=vice

   For three seasons, Bret Michaels—best known as the lead singer of
   hair-metal band Poison and the co-star of Pamela Anderson's
   lesser-known sex tape—searched America (and whatever part of France the
   extremely horny Angelique is from) to find his tour bus partner for
   life. The incessantly sloppy-drunk contestants came in hot, armed with
   an arsenal of clear heels, ass-cheek-grazing polyester dresses, and an
   insatiable desire to make out with Bret Michaels. But they were more
   than Sunset Strip groupies, strippers, and porn stars; they were women
   on a mission to get their man (and some screen time). There were
   standouts from all three seasons, like the big-haired, 80s metal
   goddess Heather, who got Michaels's name tattooed on her neck; the
   cackling, painfully earnest cowgirl Rodeo; and mean girl Ashley, whose
   magnificent implants and the way she said "bitch" made her extra
   larger-than-life. But those women were just a few in a kaleidoscope of
   big personalities, including one contestant who took everyone's used
   socks after a hockey match to keep for her personal use. In the end,
   Bret never found his true match, but the search yielded hours of
   premium entertainment.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

You love Tiffany Pollard? Then you'll definitely love I Love New York.

   After two unsuccessful efforts to win Flav's final clock, Pollard
   landed a spin-off dating show of her own. For two seasons, Pollard and
   her frighteningly brutal mom, Sister Patterson, put a group of studs
   and duds through the absolute ringer as they pledged their undying love
   for New York. Within that group were some standouts that made for
   excellent television, like excruciatingly dweeby white boy Mr. Boston,
   mouthy "stallionaire" Chance, his more tender brother Real (who
   tragically died of colon cancer in 2015), outspoken little person
   Midget Mac, Italian mama's boy Frank the Entertainer, and countless
   others. There was toe sucking, speedo wearing, a pretty bad nosebleed,
   and a fervent church service led by Sister Patterson. It was worth
   watching for Pollard's electrifying presence alone, but became a true
   carnival thanks to the full cast and their antics.

   Watch on: Hulu

If dudes who look like Criss Angel get you going, pick Daisy of Love.

   Rock of Love season 2 runner-up Daisy de la Hoya (yes, she is related
   to boxer Oscar de la Hoya) didn't leave with the man of her rock 'n'
   roll dreams. But the heavily lip-plumped rock chick did score her own
   one-season spin-off in which 20 dudes that look like they ransacked
   Dave Navarro's closet fought for her affection. The show also featured
   a set of glammed-out triplets who claimed to be Swedish rock stars in a
   band called Snake of Eden and enjoyed eating raw hot dogs out of the
   package. It's a leather-cuff and nautical-star tornado in there, and
   it's gold.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

If it's a group of lingerie-clad women flipping off outdated ideas of
respectability you like, go with Charm School.

   Charm School sought to do the impossible: reform the hard-partying and
   harder-fighting women from Flavor of Love and Rock of Love, and turn
   them into polite, well-behaved ladies. It did so in grossly outdated
   ways, like telling the women to dress and behave less sexually. But the
   ladies fought back in every possible way, finding it hard to leave
   their boozing, trash-talking, and wearing-lingerie-as-outerwear ways
   behind them. (Bless them for that.) Hosted by Mo'Nique, Sharon
   Osbourne, and Ricki Lake in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the show
   saw contestants forced to perform challenges aimed at molding them into
   business-savvy, self-sufficient women, and in some cases, contestants
   seemed to actually care about evolving into better versions of
   themselves. But many others weren't even trying, and the show will be
   forever remembered as the one where Osbourne beat up aspiring trophy
   wife Megan Hauserman after she insulted Ozzy Osbourne during the season
   2 reunion. Not the most charming moment.

   Watch on: All seasons on Amazon Prime, season 1 on Hulu

That Iconic Pic of Phoebe Waller-Bridge Smoking Was Almost Blocked by Amazon

"Smoking is always off-limits," a source reportedly said.

   The 2019 Emmys were mostly a wonky mess full of awkward TikTok jokes
   and terrifying Meryl Streep masks, but at least one genuinely good
   thing came out of it: that truly blessed image of Fleabag's Phoebe
   Waller-Bridge chilling so hard after winning a zillion much-deserved
   Emmys. The world collectively lost its mind when BBC comedy head Josh
   Cole tweeted it out last week, and since then, it has circulated
   nonstop with a million different captions about its aspirational
   qualities. But regardless, let's just take a minute and soak it in once
   again, because the sheer awesome power of the image has yet to lose its
   luster:

   It is a vibe worthy of at least an Emmy nomination on its own, but
   according to Hollywood Reporter, we almost didn't get to see it at
   all—because, apparently, Amazon doesn't approve of its stars smoking.

   Sources told the THR that Amazon was on-hand during that fateful
   Chateau Marmont afterparty, and already successfully foiled a few
   photographers from taking pictures of Waller-Bridge as she celebrated
   her post-Emmys win by ripping a cig. Luckily, the Amazon folks weren't
   fast enough to stop Cole from shooting his shot, but THR's source
   imagines the studio isn't exactly happy about it.

   com&utm_campaign=8xwvex&site=vice

   "I'm sure people are upset that [Cole's] photo made it out," the source
   said, according to Hollywood Reporter. "Smoking is always off-limits.
   But she was having fun and acting carefree."

   If by "having fun and acting carefree" the source meant "elegantly
   basking in the kind of meteoric success that the rest of us can only
   dream of," then, yes, that seems right. We common plebes are all lucky
   that Cole managed to evade the Amazon wet blankets and deliver us this
   sacred photo.

   Thank you for your service, Cole. The world needed to bare witness to
   such a blessed moment. We are forever grateful.

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.
   Advertisement

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   Enter executive producer Quincy Jones and a pilot for a new
   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still
   more acting experience than Will Smith had at the time—Parsons nabbed
   the role of Hilary Banks.

The princess of Bel-Air

   We owe the existence of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Will Smith's tax
   problems. Nearly bankrupt and millions in debt to the IRS after his
   early musical success, Smith jumped at the chance for a steady,
   lucrative gig. For the first three seasons, 70 percent of his TV
   paychecks went straight to the government.

   While the NBC sitcom took time to find its ratings footing (by its
   third season, it was America's most popular show with an all-Black
   cast), its stars clicked instantly.

   "I suddenly had a sister [Tatyana Ali], I had a little brother [Alfonso
   Ribeiro], Will was like a brother," Parsons says. "Even the crew was
   like family. Everyone embraced each other and cared about each other.
   Even if it stopped right with the pilot, it would have still been a
   life-changing experience for me."

   Perhaps most crucially for Parsons was the arrival of a new father
   figure in the form of James Avery, the actor who played Uncle Phil. "He
   was so much like 'Dad.' He took that role very seriously on camera and
   off. My dad was not a typical dad, and James was," she says. "He was
   very affectionate and warm and always paid attention to who I was going
   out with, and if he saw them, he had to shake his finger in their face.
   He was great." (Avery died in 2013 at age 68 from complications
   following open heart surgery.)

   But in 1996, after six seasons and 148 episodes, NBC cancelled Fresh
   Prince and the close-knit cast went their separate ways. "It was
   devastating to suddenly be stripped away from them," says Parsons.
   "Everybody else went home to their families when it was over, and I
   pretty much went home to my two dogs and that was it."

More than one night at The Roxbury

   It took time for Parsons' new reality to set in. Virtually her entire
   adulthood had been spent cloaked in the comforting monotony of studio
   audience laughs and craft services lunches. Now, she found herself in a
   daze, and it took a run-in with her former junior-high friend Lenny
   Kravitz—whose mom had been a sitcom star on The Jeffersons—to shake her
   out of it.

   "I bumped into him not that long after Fresh Prince had been off, and
   he was the first person who looked at me and said, 'But how are you
   really doing?' Whether he meant it to laser in like that, it hit me,"
   she says. "It was the first time I really acknowledged that I wasn't
   doing that well. I was kind of tap dancing as fast as I could and not
   paying attention to the fact that it was a struggle."

   Meanwhile, substantial roles for women of color in the 90s were few and
   far between. During seasonal breaks on Fresh Prince, Parsons had
   managed to book films like Major Payne and Class Act but found it
   difficult to find decent projects even once freed of the hectic
   schedule of network TV.

   "There were a handful of actresses that were doing the work, and most
   of their names were Halle Berry," she laughs. "I was always like,
   'Halle got it again!' It seemed like there were so few roles and Halle
   was working like crazy, deservedly so."

   Parsons carved out her own opportunity in the form of a feminist sitcom
   called Lush Life that she co-created, produced, and starred in with pal
   Lori Petty. But the series premiered to dismal reviews (from mostly
   male critics) in September 1996, and after just four episodes aired,
   Fox pulled the plug.

   "It was a learning experience. Man, I learned so much doing that show,"
   Parsons says. "I've never worked so hard, but all of the new Fox
   comedies were taken off [when studio execs changed that year]. It
   didn't matter how well we had tested—because our show had tested really
   well—everything got yanked."

   Outside of work, Parsons and Petty became regulars at Hollywood's
   legendary Roxbury nightclub, known for its VIP clientele and celebrity
   drama.

   "I had a lot of fun times there, but there was also a lot of that
   chasing the dragon kind of thing," she says. "I remember it got to the
   point when Lori and I had worked out, and we'd show up at the Roxbury
   with our hair pulled up and no makeup in sweatpants and sneakers, and
   the bouncer would let us through, past everybody else, into the club.
   We had gotten so lazy about it. It was weird. All that shine was
   probably wearing off a little bit. You go expecting that same feeling,
   and then after a while, it's kind of like, why are we here?"

Starting over

   Advertisement

   Eager for a change of scenery, Parsons moved to New York and continued
   acting in films like Mixing Nia and The Ladies Man, as well as Denis
   Leary's short-lived 2001 detective comedy The Job. Her cross-country
   move also led her to her now-husband, filmmaker Alexandre Rockwell,
   whom she met at a mutual friend's restaurant opening. They married in
   2003, and welcomed a daughter named Lana that same year. Their son,
   Nico, followed in 2007.

   "My interests were changing," she says. "It became very difficult to do
   everything, to memorize lines for a part and have to get someone to
   last-minute watch the kids—to race across town and do all that, and if
   you got a call back, do it again. I'd find myself dropping the ball a
   lot."

   Parsons began focusing on writing, and in 2005 founded the non-profit
   organization Sweet Blackberry, aimed at educating children about
   little-known parts of African American history. The idea had been
   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   by Ashley Spencer
   Oct 2 2019, 5:21pm
   ShareTweet

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.
   1570034165606-whatever-happened-to

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.
   1570034165606-whatever-happened-to

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   &utm_campaign=evj5kz&site=vice

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   Enter executive producer Quincy Jones and a pilot for a new
   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still
   more acting experience than Will Smith had at the time—Parsons nabbed
   the role of Hilary Banks.

The princess of Bel-Air

   We owe the existence of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Will Smith's tax
   problems. Nearly bankrupt and millions in debt to the IRS after his
   early musical success, Smith jumped at the chance for a steady,
   lucrative gig. For the first three seasons, 70 percent of his TV
   paychecks went straight to the government.

   While the NBC sitcom took time to find its ratings footing (by its
   third season, it was America's most popular show with an all-Black
   cast), its stars clicked instantly.

   "I suddenly had a sister [Tatyana Ali], I had a little brother [Alfonso
   Ribeiro], Will was like a brother," Parsons says. "Even the crew was
   like family. Everyone embraced each other and cared about each other.
   Even if it stopped right with the pilot, it would have still been a
   life-changing experience for me."

   Perhaps most crucially for Parsons was the arrival of a new father
   figure in the form of James Avery, the actor who played Uncle Phil. "He
   was so much like 'Dad.' He took that role very seriously on camera and
   off. My dad was not a typical dad, and James was," she says. "He was
   very affectionate and warm and always paid attention to who I was going
   out with, and if he saw them, he had to shake his finger in their face.
   He was great." (Avery died in 2013 at age 68 from complications
   following open heart surgery.)

   But in 1996, after six seasons and 148 episodes, NBC cancelled Fresh
   Prince and the close-knit cast went their separate ways. "It was
   devastating to suddenly be stripped away from them," says Parsons.
   "Everybody else went home to their families when it was over, and I
   pretty much went home to my two dogs and that was it."

More than one night at The Roxbury

   It took time for Parsons' new reality to set in. Virtually her entire
   adulthood had been spent cloaked in the comforting monotony of studio
   audience laughs and craft services lunches. Now, she found herself in a
   daze, and it took a run-in with her former junior-high friend Lenny
   Kravitz—whose mom had been a sitcom star on The Jeffersons—to shake her
   out of it.

   "I bumped into him not that long after Fresh Prince had been off, and
   he was the first person who looked at me and said, 'But how are you
   really doing?' Whether he meant it to laser in like that, it hit me,"
   she says. "It was the first time I really acknowledged that I wasn't
   doing that well. I was kind of tap dancing as fast as I could and not
   paying attention to the fact that it was a struggle."

   Meanwhile, substantial roles for women of color in the 90s were few and
   far between. During seasonal breaks on Fresh Prince, Parsons had
   managed to book films like Major Payne and Class Act but found it
   difficult to find decent projects even once freed of the hectic
   schedule of network TV.

   "There were a handful of actresses that were doing the work, and most
   of their names were Halle Berry," she laughs. "I was always like,
   'Halle got it again!' It seemed like there were so few roles and Halle
   was working like crazy, deservedly so."

   Parsons carved out her own opportunity in the form of a feminist sitcom
   called Lush Life that she co-created, produced, and starred in with pal
   Lori Petty. But the series premiered to dismal reviews (from mostly
   male critics) in September 1996, and after just four episodes aired,
   Fox pulled the plug.

   "It was a learning experience. Man, I learned so much doing that show,"
   Parsons says. "I've never worked so hard, but all of the new Fox
   comedies were taken off [when studio execs changed that year]. It
   didn't matter how well we had tested—because our show had tested really
   well—everything got yanked."

   ds-rider-strong-now-2019?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign
   =evj5kz&site=vice

   Outside of work, Parsons and Petty became regulars at Hollywood's
   legendary Roxbury nightclub, known for its VIP clientele and celebrity
   drama.

   "I had a lot of fun times there, but there was also a lot of that
   chasing the dragon kind of thing," she says. "I remember it got to the
   point when Lori and I had worked out, and we'd show up at the Roxbury
   with our hair pulled up and no makeup in sweatpants and sneakers, and
   the bouncer would let us through, past everybody else, into the club.
   We had gotten so lazy about it. It was weird. All that shine was
   probably wearing off a little bit. You go expecting that same feeling,
   and then after a while, it's kind of like, why are we here?"

Starting over

   Eager for a change of scenery, Parsons moved to New York and continued
   acting in films like Mixing Nia and The Ladies Man, as well as Denis
   Leary's short-lived 2001 detective comedy The Job. Her cross-country
   move also led her to her now-husband, filmmaker Alexandre Rockwell,
   whom she met at a mutual friend's restaurant opening. They married in
   2003, and welcomed a daughter named Lana that same year. Their son,
   Nico, followed in 2007.

   "My interests were changing," she says. "It became very difficult to do
   everything, to memorize lines for a part and have to get someone to
   last-minute watch the kids—to race across town and do all that, and if
   you got a call back, do it again. I'd find myself dropping the ball a
   lot."

   Parsons began focusing on writing, and in 2005 founded the non-profit
   organization Sweet Blackberry, aimed at educating children about
   little-known parts of African American history. The idea had been
   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   mbed_vice.com&utm_campaign=evj5kz&site=vice

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."

   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."

A Brief History of Gwyneth Paltrow Not Remembering Things She's Done

Spiderman who? The actress and entrepreneur can't seem to recall movies she's
been in, people she's worked with, and products she's endorsed.

   Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's much-maligned wellness company, has a lot of
   products for one's wellbeing, from "dopamine bean" powder to elevate
   mood, to rhodiola to soothe stress, and L-theanine chews to increase
   one's focus. Amid all of Goop's resources for mood and "mindfulness"
   and all of its clothes, books, cosmetics, and $500 vibrators intended
   to make you feel better and boost brain function, the company doesn't
   quite touch the topic of memory—which is something its owner, Gwyneth
   Paltrow, seems to need a little help with.

   Over the past few months, Paltrow's recall of some of her bigger
   projects has proven to be shaky at best. Here are a few of the most
   notable examples. Just aloof, or forgetful: you decide.

Spiderman?

   the-mcu-has-a-chance-to-get-riskier?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&u
   tm_campaign=ne84gd&site=vice

   In June, Netflix released the Jon Favreau-directed series The Chef
   Show, which centered on cameos from Favreau's celebrity friends,
   including his Marvel movie co-stars Tom Holland, Robert Downey Jr., and
   Gwyneth Paltrow. In the show's first episode, Favreau and chef Roy Choi
   cook a pepper pot soup with Paltrow, who starred as Pepper Potts in
   every Iron Man and Avengers installment, as well as in Spider-Man:
   Homecoming. Paltrow, however, quickly made it clear that she doesn't
   really recall her role in the franchise.

   "Spider-Man? We weren't in Spider-Man," Paltrow said, after Favreau
   shared a reference to the film set. "No, I was in Avengers." It takes a
   little explaining about the specific Homecoming scene from Favreau
   before Paltrow remembers that, yes, she was in the movie. In her
   defense on this one, there are a lot of Marvel movies to keep up with,
   and getting Avengers and Homecoming mixed up could really happen to
   anyone who doesn't totally stan the MCU. Let's move along.

"That Guy"?

   In an interview with PopSugar later that month, Tom Holland, who plays
   Spider-Man, acknowledged that the actress doesn't exactly remember him
   either, despite his titular role in, you know, the movie she was in. "I
   mean, I've only worked with Gwyneth one time, on Spider-Man:
   Homecoming—which she doesn't remember. Still to this day breaks my
   heart," Holland said.

   Then, Holland clarified, Paltrow might actually remember him... as
   "that guy." He referenced an Instagram shot of himself, Robert Downey
   Jr., and Paltrow from the set of Avengers: Endgame, which Paltrow
   posted with the caption, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, dear heart. Love me and that
   other guy in the photo." A cheeky joke, maybe—but it isn't looking
   great for Gwyneth's Marvel movie memory.

Sebastian Stan Who?

   A few weeks later, Sebastian Stan, who played Bucky Barnes in several
   Marvel movies including Captain America, acknowledged that Paltrow
   doesn't really remember him either. A picture Stan posted to Instagram
   in July of him posing with Paltrow and fashion icons like Valentino
   Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti included the line, "Also glad I got to
   reintroduce myself to @gwynethpaltrow for the third time. We are in the
   same film...🤷🏻‍♂️."

   Hmm, but before we write that one off as just another joke, let's
   briefly revisit the fact that at the Avengers: Infinity War world
   premiere in April 2018, Paltrow was pointedly caught on video asking
   "who's that?" after seeing Sebastian Stan. A person, identified as
   Chris Pratt, then explains to her, "Sebastian Stan plays Bucky. Bucky
   is the Winter Soldier."

OK, but that's just Marvel...

   It's a fair argument, sure, that Paltrow doesn't really care that much
   for the MCU and its many movies and sequels, which explains her exit
   from the role of Potts after Avengers: Endgame and perhaps also her
   vague disregard for its storylines and characters. She wants to spend
   her time and ashwaganda-powered mental stamina on Goop, one might say.
   And to that, we have yet another example.

"GP's" Goop Picks?

   In a segment last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the eponymous host
   presented Paltrow with a selection of Goop products. Despite seeming
   familiarity with the first product, an "emotional detox bath soak,"
   Paltrow seems more hazy on the rest of Kimmel's Goop selections.

   In response to a fancy glass water bottle with an amethyst at its core,
   Paltrow isn't quite sure how to explain its purpose. "They say that
   amethyst, it's supposed to be heart opening or something like that,"
   she said, with a confused look on her face. "I don't know [who says
   that], but it's so pretty!"

   IFRAME:

   tflix-show-2019?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=ne84gd&s
   ite=vice

   Kimmel then shows Paltrow two bottles of camel milk, which he says have
   been included on Goop's gift guides in the past. "Apparently it's
   really from camels. Are you gonna... try some?" Paltrow said in a
   skeptical tone, before acknowledging that she hadn't actually tried it
   before. "I think they purport to have some more vitamins?" Ultimately,
   the verdict is that the camel milk is good.

   Still, one might expect Paltrow to have tried it before, given that
   Goop's products all come with the implicit endorsement of "GP" herself.
   "GP created goop to organize her unbiased travel recommendations,
   health-centric recipes, and shopping discoveries for friends, and also
   as a place to get her own questions," reads the site's About page.

   We get it: Life is busy, especially when you star in an endless film
   franchise and run a business, and we can't all be tasked with
   remembering everything (especially when there are assistants for that,
   right?). But maybe, soon enough, there will be a tincture, chew, or
   powder for that—and when that time comes, we'll expect to see it right
   there, for sale on Goop.

David Letterman's Sex Scandal Still Feels Unresolved 10 Years Later

After the host admitted to sleeping with members of his staff, the world
collectively shrugged. But maybe his behavior deserves more scrutiny in the
post-#MeToo era.

   On October 1, 2009, David Letterman came back from a commercial break
   on The Late Show and asked his audience if he could tell them a story.
   A few weeks earlier, he explained, he'd gotten into his car early one
   morning and found a mysterious package sitting in the backseat. Inside
   the package was a letter.

   "It says that, 'I know that you do some terrible, terrible things. And
   I can prove that you do these terrible things,'" Letterman said on the
   air. "And sure enough, contained in the package was stuff to prove that
   I do terrible things."

   The audience chuckled uncomfortably. At first, he wouldn't say what
   those "terrible things" were. He carefully omitted them, chronicling
   what happened next while leaving that critical piece of information
   unexplained.

   Letterman told the audience that he immediately called his lawyer.
   Whoever had left him the package wanted $2 million to keep quiet about
   what they knew. He and his lawyer contacted the Manhattan District
   Attorney's Office, which informed them that the threat constituted
   blackmail. The lawyer met with Letterman's extortionist a few times,
   including at least one rendezvous which, unbeknownst to the criminal,
   was secretly recorded. Ultimately, the man was given a phony check for
   $2 million. On the afternoon of October 1, a few hours before that
   day's Late Show taping, the blackmailer was arrested.

   The audience laughed and applauded throughout Letterman's monologue,
   which he peppered with jokes, self-effacing asides, and descriptions of
   how "terrified" he was about the ordeal. The whole thing felt a little
   like a stand-up routine. About seven minutes into the segment—having
   sufficiently positioned himself as the victim—Letterman finally
   revealed what "terrible, terrible things" his blackmailer knew about
   him.

   "The creepy stuff was," Letterman said, "that I have had sex with women
   who work for me on this show."

   He paused. The studio was silent.

   "Now, my response to that is: Yes, I have. Would it be embarrassing if
   it were made public? Perhaps it would. Perhaps it would," Letterman
   said. "Especially for the women."

   The crowd erupted in laughter and applause.

   That's about all Letterman said on the matter. He cut to commercial
   break moments later, and brought out Woody Harrelson when he came back.

   Over the next few days, details of Letterman's affairs came to light in
   the press. He had apparently been sleeping with Stephanie Birkitt, a
   34-year-old who had gone from being an intern on The Late Show to
   Letterman's personal assistant and had appeared in countless segments,
   including as a correspondent at the Olympics. The blackmailer, Joe
   Halderman, was her boyfriend. Another woman, Holly Hester, told TMZ she
   dated Letterman when she was an intern on the Late Show and a student
   at NYU.

   Letterman was married when he confessed to having sex with women who
   worked for him. He still is, to Regina Lasko. The two met when she was
   a production staffer on Late Night with David Letterman; at the time
   they started dating, he was already in a relationship with Merrill
   Markoe, his former head writer.

   The Monday after he made his confession, Letterman spoke about his
   infidelities on-air again, apologizing to his staff and his wife.

   “She has been horribly hurt by my behavior, and when something happens
   like that, if you hurt a person and it’s your responsibility, you try
   to fix it," Letterman said. "And at that point, there’s only two things
   that can happen: Either you’re going to make some progress and get it
   fixed, or you’re going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed. So
   let me tell you, folks—I got my work cut out for me.”

   After that, he never brought the incident up on The Late Show again.

   The response to Letterman's confession was, essentially, a big,
   collective shrug. On The View, Barbara Walters lauded him for coming
   clean and getting out in front of the story, called him "a very
   attractive man," and emphasized that he hadn't been accused of sexual
   harassment. “Where do you meet people? In the workplace," she said. "It
   isn’t sexual harassment."

   Writing for the New York Times, Maureen Dowd dismissed the notion that
   Letterman's behavior constituted anything too untoward, explaining that
   "the women who got involved with Letterman were not pressured."

   "Sexual harassment entails pressuring or penalizing a staffer or making
   the office atmosphere hostile," she wrote. "There’s no evidence yet
   that Letterman was guilty of that."

   Letterman may not have ever pressured staffers into having sex with
   him. But that doesn't necessarily mean his behavior deserves the kind
   of sweeping, all-is-forgiven pass it received.

   Birkitt's star rose quickly at The Late Show. After being promoted to
   his assistant, she became a regular on-air talent, making more than 250
   appearances on camera. According to an article in New York Magazine,
   which cited staffers who worked on the show during Birkitt's tenure,
   her personal relationship with Letterman was, essentially, an open
   secret.

   How might other female staffers, who weren't sleeping with Letterman,
   have felt seeing Birkitt's career take off so successfully? Letterman
   never explicitly dangled sex as a means for promotion at The Late Show,
   at least not that we know of. But that doesn't mean that—in showing
   special attention to an employee he had a sexual relationship
   with—Letterman didn't create an uncomfortable, toxic environment for
   other women who worked for him.

   According to Nell Scovell, who wrote for Late Night in the 1990s, the
   host did just that. Writing for Vanity Fair in 2009, she said
   Letterman's trysts with female staffers—which, apparently, weren't
   limited to just Hester and Birkitt—made working for him uncomfortable.
   So uncomfortable, in fact, that she ultimately "walked away from her
   dream job."

   "There’s a subset of sexual harassment called sexual favoritism that,
   according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, can lead to a
   'hostile work environment,' often 'creating an atmosphere that is
   demeaning to women,'" Scovell wrote. "And that pretty much sums up my
   experience at Late Night with David Letterman."

   She continued:

   Without naming names or digging up decades-old dirt, let’s address the
   pertinent questions. Did Dave hit on me? No. Did he pay me enough extra
   attention that it was noted by another writer? Yes. Was I aware of
   rumors that Dave was having sexual relationships with female staffers?
   Yes. Was I aware that other high-level male employees were having
   sexual relationships with female staffers? Yes. Did these female
   staffers have access to information and wield power disproportionate to
   their job titles? Yes. Did that create a hostile work environment? Yes.
   Did I believe these female staffers were benefiting professionally from
   their personal relationships? Yes. Did that make me feel demeaned?
   Completely. Did I say anything at the time? Sadly, no.

   Despite the fact that Scovell's piece ran just weeks after Letterman's
   on-air admission, it never seemed to gain much traction. At the time,
   virtually the only entity to back her up—to agree that having sex with
   some staffers and then showing them preferential treatment in the
   workplace is wrong—was the National Organization for Women.

   "As 'the boss,' [Letterman] is responsible for setting the tone for his
   entire workplace—and he did that with sex," NOW wrote in a statement.
   "In any work environment, this places all employees—including employees
   who happen to be women—in an awkward, confusing, and demoralizing
   situation."

   Why wasn't that a bigger part of the conversation? How did so many
   commentators, from an immensely popular talk show host to a
   Pulitzer-winning New York Times columnist, fail to see the problem with
   a powerful boss sleeping with his subordinates, who—according to
   another employee—then enjoyed professional privileges? And why—ten
   years later, at a time when Letterman has a new, big-budget talk show
   on Netflix—have we still not reckoned with those questions?

   Let's imagine if Letterman had made the same confession today. In the
   post-#MeToo era, we might have reacted differently. So many stories
   that have come out about sexual misconduct, in Hollywood and beyond,
   involve fostering a "toxic workplace" for employees. Perhaps we didn't
   have the tools, in 2009—the collective vocabulary—to identify why
   Letterman's behavior might have been harmful and demeaning to his
   employees. As Scovell tells it, that behavior was harmful; it was
   demeaning. Perhaps, in 2009, we just didn't think it was a big deal.

   There's a disturbing trend, when it comes to sexual misconduct, whereby
   if a celebrity committed some impropriety long enough before the Harvey
   Weinstein revelations came to light, they seem to escape judgment—at
   least for a time. Years after Woody Allen was accused of molesting
   Dylan Farrow as a child, he continues to make movies with major studios
   and A-list stars. Even though we've known about the infamous footage of
   R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl since 2002, he wasn't widely
   condemned until recently. By no means can we compare what they've done
   to Letterman's affairs; but we could argue that Letterman benefits from
   the same circumstances. The era in which he admitted to sleeping with
   women who worked for him, allegedly creating a hostile workplace for
   his female staffers, happened long enough ago that we've all but
   forgotten about it. And, in the process, we've tacitly forgiven him.

   This isn't to say that Letterman should be cast out of Hollywood, or
   that he deserves to lose his deal with Netflix. His affairs, while
   confusing and demoralizing for some of the women who worked under him,
   appeared to be entirely consensual. But in 2019, it just seems strange,
   and perhaps unfair, that we've never taken a full accounting of what
   went on behind the scenes at The Late Show—and, at least publicly,
   neither has he.

   Letterman admitted that he had sex with his employees. He apologized to
   his wife. But he never apologized to women like Scovell. He never
   engaged with the idea that he might have made his show an unfair and
   difficult place for women to work, a place where—intentionally or
   not—he signaled that having sex with the bosses was a way to get ahead.

   As Letterman himself said back in 2009, "if you hurt a person and it’s
   your responsibility, you try to fix it." Ten years later, it’s worth
   asking whether he ever really tried hard enough.
