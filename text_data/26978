   Through a series of ongoing installations, films and publications, the
   project aims to give a glimpse into a near-future city co-habit
   with ‘intelligent’ semi autonomous, networked, flying machines.

   We were pleased to be invited by the V&A to present an installation of
   the project within the Civic Objects display at their ground-breaking
   show ‘All Of This Belongs To You’, running from 1st April to 19th July
   2015. You’ll find our installation in Rapid Response Collecting, within
   the 20th century design exhibits, in the space adjacent to the smashed
   Snowden hard drive and laptop lent by the Guardian.

   The installation at the V&A contains a family of 5 drones and an
   accompanying film. Each drone is designed to be symbolic of the
   convergence of wider social and tech trends with specific tasks and
   functions that are gaining popularity amongst drone enthusiasts and
   entrepreneurs.


   1. Madison, The Flying Billboard: This is an advertising drone, a
   hovering display platform, which can swoop, scan and hunt consumer
   demographics. It uses sophisticated facial recognition to gain feedback
   on the effectiveness of its content and to tailor advertisements to the
   interests of those within its vicinity.

   2. Newsbreaker, The Media Drone: Supported by algorithmic monitoring
   news, emergency services and social media in real-time, these nimble
   devices push the boundaries for what has become known as High Frequency
   Journalism, helping feed our growing hugger for the very latest
   breaking news stories as it happens. As it films and streams news in
   real-time, story writing algorithms parse imagery, audio, web and radio
   traffic into rapidly growing, and continually edited, column inches.

   3. Nightwatchman, The Surveillance Drone: A highly mobile data
   acquisition device used by everyone from local councils to law
   enforcement agencies. By securely connecting to a centralised database
   The Nightwatchman is able to amass and utilise huge amounts of location
   and subject specific information assisting in everything from
   documenting civil offences to detecting potential terror threats.

   4. RouteHawk, Traffic Management Assistant: This drone fulfills two
   primary functions: firstly with its high brightness LED display and
   powerful 8 motor design the RouteHawk can move quickly to problem
   situations and provide dynamic warnings to approaching drivers.
   Secondly its LIDAR speed detector and ANPR camera allow the RouteHawk
   to efficiently log and transmit traffic violations to relevant penalty
   enforcement departments, often allowing a unit to pay for itself within
   a month.

   5. FlyCam Instadrone: A highly accessible, low cost, user-friendly
   platform with true ‘smart’ style functionality. Quickly superseding the
   Selfie stick as todays must have life-logging and social media tool,
   the FlyCam allows anyone with a smartphone to share unforgettable
   memories from the clouds to the cloud using the Instadrone app.
   Additionally, its patented context aware algorithm means advertisers
   can deliver messages to customer when and where it counts.

   The Film:

   In order to explore the themes and ideas that have developed though our
   research in greater depth, we made a film.

   In the film, the drones become protagonists, revealing fleeting
   glimpses of the city from their perspective, as they continuously
   collect data and perform tasks. It hints at a world where
   the ‘network’ begins to gain physical autonomy, moving through and
   making decisions about the world, influencing our lives in often opaque
   yet profound ways. A speculative map highlights where physical and
   digital infrastructures merge as our cities become the natural habitat
   for ‘smart’ technologies from drones and wearable computers through to
   driverless cars.

   The project has previously exhibited at FabMind, 21_21 Design Sight in
   Tokyo, and we have written about the work for Virgin Unite.
   We have published a journal on our blog where share some of our intent
   behind the project, as well as our process of research, design,
   hacking, building and testing.
