About


   The Real Food Dietitians is the passion-driven product of Registered
   Dietitian Nutritionists Stacie Hassing and Jessica Beacom. They’ve
   combined their love of nutrition, health and real food with the
   concepts of ease and convenience to bring you recipes that are big on
   flavor but short on ingredients.

     __________________________________________________________________


Jessica Beacom, RDN

   Jessica is a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist in Boulder, CO. She’s
   been practicing nutrition for more than 15 years helping those she
   works with find freedom from diets and calorie counting and find true
   health and wellness through a real food diet. She firmly believes that
   all disease starts in the gut and healing comes from real,
   traditionally prepared foods like sauerkraut and bone broth.  Her
   passion for delicious, wholesome and nourishing food is contagious,
   having been described as “a real food evangelist”.

   In her spare time, Jessica is mama of two young daughters, wife to a
   registered nurse and Jack-of-all-trades, CrossFitter, overzealous
   gardener, keeper of backyard chickens, telemark skier and lover all
   outdoor adventures with her kids. Cooking is her therapy and there’s
   always something bubbling and fermenting on her kitchen counters.

   Education: Jessica received her Bachelors of Science in Human Nutrition
   & Dietetics from Montana State University-Bozeman and completed her
   Dietetic Internship at the University of Alaska.

Stacie Hassing, RDN, LD

   Stacie is a Licensed and Registered Dietitian from Minnesota striving
   to make a positive difference in as many lives as she can through sound
   nutrition and lifestyle guidance. Her strong passion to help others
   learn quality, REAL Food nutrition is the driving force behind the
   co-development of  The Real Food Dietitians brand.

   Stacie continuously emphasizes that nutrition begins within and more
   than anything is the foundation of our health and well-being. So often
   we focus on our physical appearance and forget about what truly is most
   important, our internal health and beauty. Like Jessica, you will not
   find Stacie recommending calorie counting, food restrictions, or
   encouraging “diet” foods. Instead her goal is to help others develop a
   healthy more mindful relationship with food and learn how to enjoy
   non-processed, nourishing, healing, real foods, in a way that works for
   them!

   Education: Stacie received her  Bachelor of Science degree in Dietetics
   at the University of Wisconsin Stout and completed her post-graduate
   internship at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.

   She is married to her husband Shane and they have two furry 4-legged
   children, Walter and Lucy Lou. Learn more fun facts and tidbits about
   Stacie here.
