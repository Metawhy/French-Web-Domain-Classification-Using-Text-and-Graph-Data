Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability

   The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to
   define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely
   operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability
   policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended
   analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries,
   they identify three (including climate change) that might push the
   Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive
   influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB
   framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.

Structured Abstract

INTRODUCTION

   There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the
   continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the
   Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary
   boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a
   science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will
   destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific
   underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.

RATIONALE

   The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only
   state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human
   societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are
   affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of
   the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of
   increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on
   critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved
   scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary
   principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic
   perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is
   likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal
   development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of
   increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES,
   and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison
   with the proposed PB (see the figure).

RESULTS

   Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and
   ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier
   analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs
   have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity
   loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use.
   At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be
   established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot
   identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new
   substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms
   that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological
   effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential
   to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and
   biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their
   fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a
   manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at
   Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in
   the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change.
   Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features
   (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and
   land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).

CONCLUSIONS

   PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES
   beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression
   of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene
   state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB
   framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are
   political decisions that must include consideration of the human
   dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework.
   Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on
   Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to
   decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.

   Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary
   boundaries.

   The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the
   zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone.
   The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and
   yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone
   of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent
   values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for
   climate change is atmospheric CO[2] concentration. Processes for which
   global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by
   gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and
   the functional role of biosphere integrity.

Abstract

   The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for
   humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the
   stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary
   boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical
   science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and
   on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of
   the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance
   of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the
   processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate
   change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has
   the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state
   should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.

   The planetary boundary (PB) approach (1, 2) aims to define a safe
   operating space for human societies to develop and thrive, based on our
   evolving understanding of the functioning and resilience of the Earth
   system. Since its introduction, the framework has been subject to
   scientific scrutiny [e.g., (3–7)] and has attracted considerable
   interest and discussions within the policy, governance, and business
   sectors as an approach to inform efforts toward global sustainability
   (8–10).

   In this analysis, we further develop the basic PB framework by (i)
   introducing a two-tier approach for several of the boundaries to
   account for regional-level heterogeneity; (ii) updating the
   quantification of most of the PBs; (iii) identifying two core
   boundaries; and (iv) proposing a regional-level quantitative boundary
   for one of the two that were not quantified earlier (1).

The basic framework: Defining a safe operating space

   Throughout history, humanity has faced environmental constraints at
   local and regional levels, with some societies dealing with these
   challenges more effectively than others (11, 12). More recently, early
   industrial societies often used local waterways and airsheds as dumping
   grounds for their waste and effluent from industrial processes. This
   eroded local and regional environmental quality and stability,
   threatening to undermine the progress made through industrialization by
   damaging human health and degrading ecosystems. Eventually, this led to
   the introduction of local or regional boundaries or constraints on what
   could be emitted to and extracted from the environment (e.g., chemicals
   that pollute airsheds or waterways) and on how much the environment
   could be changed by direct human modification (land-use/cover change in
   natural ecosystems) (13). The regulation of some human impacts on the
   environment—for example, the introduction of chemical contaminants—is
   often framed in the context of “safe limits” (14).

   These issues remain, but in addition we now face constraints at the
   planetary level, where the magnitude of the challenge is vastly
   different. The human enterprise has grown so dramatically since the
   mid-20th century (15) that the relatively stable, 11,700-year-long
   Holocene epoch, the only state of the planet that we know for certain
   can support contemporary human societies, is now being destabilized
   (figs. S1 and S2) (16–18). In fact, a new geological epoch, the
   Anthropocene, has been proposed (19).

   The precautionary principle suggests that human societies would be
   unwise to drive the Earth system substantially away from a
   Holocene-like condition. A continuing trajectory away from the Holocene
   could lead, with an uncomfortably high probability, to a very different
   state of the Earth system, one that is likely to be much less
   hospitable to the development of human societies (17, 18, 20). The PB
   framework aims to help guide human societies away from such a
   trajectory by defining a “safe operating space” in which we can
   continue to develop and thrive. It does this by proposing boundaries
   for anthropogenic perturbation of critical Earth-system processes.
   Respecting these boundaries would greatly reduce the risk that
   anthropogenic activities could inadvertently drive the Earth system to
   a much less hospitable state.

   Nine processes, each of which is clearly being modified by human
   actions, were originally suggested to form the basis of the PB
   framework (1). Although these processes are fundamental to Earth-system
   functioning, there are many other ways that Earth-system functioning
   could be described, including potentially valuable metrics for
   quantifying the human imprint on it. These alternative approaches
   [e.g., (4)] often represent ways to explore and quantify interactions
   among the boundaries. They can provide a valuable complement to the
   original approach (1) and further enrich the broader PB concept as it
   continues to evolve.

The planetary boundary framework: Thresholds, feedbacks, resilience,
uncertainties

   A planetary boundary as originally defined (1) is not equivalent to a
   global threshold or tipping point. As Fig. 1 shows, even when a global-
   or continental/ocean basin–level threshold in an Earth-system process
   is likely to exist [e.g., (20, 21)], the proposed planetary boundary is
   not placed at the position of the biophysical threshold but rather
   upstream of it—i.e., well before reaching the threshold. This buffer
   between the boundary (the end of the safe operating space, the green
   zone in Fig. 1) and the threshold not only accounts for uncertainty in
   the precise position of the threshold with respect to the control
   variable but also allows society time to react to early warning signs
   that it may be approaching a threshold and consequent abrupt or risky
   change.

   showing the safe operating space, the zone of uncertainty, the position
   of the threshold (where one is likely to exist), and the area of high
   risk.

   Modified from (1).

   The developing science of early-warning signs can warn of an
   approaching threshold or a decrease in the capability of a system to
   persist under changing conditions. Examples include “critical slowing
   down” in a process (22), increasing variance (23), and flickering
   between states of the system (24–26). However, for such science to be
   useful in a policy context, it must provide enough time for society to
   respond in order to steer away from an impending threshold before it is
   crossed (27, 28). The problem of system inertia—for example, in the
   climate system (18)—needs to be taken into account in assessing the
   time needed for society to react to early-warning signs.

   Not all Earth-system processes included in the PB approach have
   singular thresholds at the global/continental/ocean basin level (1).
   Nevertheless, it is important that boundaries be established for these
   processes. They affect the capacity of the Earth system to persist in a
   Holocene-like state under changing conditions (henceforth “resilience”)
   by regulating biogeochemical flows (e.g., the terrestrial and marine
   biological carbon sinks) or by providing the capacity for ecosystems to
   tolerate perturbations and shocks and to continue functioning under
   changing abiotic conditions (29, 30). Examples of such processes are
   land-system change, freshwater use, change in biosphere integrity [rate
   of biodiversity loss in (1, 2)], and changes in other biogeochemical
   flows in addition to carbon (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus). Placing
   boundaries for these processes is more difficult than for those with
   known large-scale thresholds (21) but is nevertheless important for
   maintaining the resilience of the Earth system as a whole. As indicated
   in Fig. 1, these processes, many of which show threshold behavior at
   local and regional scales, can generate feedbacks to the processes that
   do have large-scale thresholds. The classic example is the possible
   weakening of natural carbon sinks, which could further destabilize the
   climate system and push it closer to large thresholds [e.g, loss of the
   Greenland ice sheet (18)]. An interesting research question of
   relevance to the PB framework is how small-scale regime shifts can
   propagate across scales and possibly lead to global-level transitions
   (31, 32).

   A zone of uncertainty, sometimes large, is associated with each of the
   boundaries (yellow zone in Fig. 1). This zone encapsulates both gaps
   and weaknesses in the scientific knowledge base and intrinsic
   uncertainties in the functioning of the Earth system. At the “safe” end
   of the zone of uncertainty, current scientific knowledge suggests that
   there is very low probability of crossing a critical threshold or
   substantially eroding the resilience of the Earth system. Beyond the
   “danger” end of the zone of uncertainty, current knowledge suggests a
   much higher probability of a change to the functioning of the Earth
   system that could potentially be devastating for human societies.
   Application of the precautionary principle dictates that the planetary
   boundary is set at the “safe” end of the zone of uncertainty. This does
   not mean that transgressing a boundary will instantly lead to an
   unwanted outcome but that the farther the boundary is transgressed, the
   higher the risk of regime shifts, destabilized system processes, or
   erosion of resilience and the fewer the opportunities to prepare for
   such changes. Observations of the climate system show this principle in
   action by the influence of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations on the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather
   events (17, 18).

Linking global and regional scales

   PB processes operate across scales, from ocean basins/biomes or
   sources/sinks to the level of the Earth system as a whole. Here, we
   address the subglobal aspects of the PB framework. Rockström et al. (1)
   estimated global boundaries only, acknowledging that the control
   variables for many processes are spatially heterogeneous. That is,
   changes in control variables at the subglobal level can influence
   functioning at the Earth-system level, which indicates the need to
   define subglobal boundaries that are compatible with the global-level
   boundary definition. Avoiding the transgression of subglobal boundaries
   would thus contribute to an aggregate outcome within a planetary-level
   safe operating space.

   We focus on the five PBs that have strong regional operating scales:
   biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows [earlier termed “phosphorus
   (P) and nitrogen (N) cycles” (1, 2)], land-system change, freshwater
   use, and atmospheric aerosol loading. Table S1 describes how
   transgression of any of the proposed boundaries at the subglobal level
   affects the Earth system at the global level.

   For those processes where subglobal dynamics potentially play a
   critical role in global dynamics, the operational challenge is to
   capture the importance of subglobal change for the functioning of the
   Earth system. To do this, we propose the development of a two-level set
   of control variables and boundaries. The subglobal-level units of
   analysis for these six boundaries are not identical; they vary
   according to the role that the processes play in the Earth system: (i)
   changes in biosphere integrity occur at the level of land-based biomes,
   large freshwater ecosystems, or major marine ecosystems as the largest
   subglobal unit; (ii) the role of direct, human-driven land-system
   change in biophysical climate regulation is primarily related to
   changes in forest biomes; (iii) freshwater flows and use occur at the
   largest subglobal level in the major river basins around the world; and
   (iv) changes in biogeochemical flows, exemplified by phosphorus and
   nitrogen cycling, aggregate from relatively localized but very severe
   perturbations in intensive agricultural zones to affect global flows of
   nutrients. We recognize these as critical regions for Earth-system
   functioning. Where appropriate, the updates of the individual
   boundaries (see below) (33) now contain both the globally aggregated
   boundary value of the control variable and its regional distribution
   function. Figure 2 shows the distributions and current status of the
   control variables for three of the boundaries where subglobal dynamics
   are critical: biogeochemical cycles, land-system change, and freshwater
   use.

   land-system change; and (D) freshwater use. In each panel, green areas
   are within the boundary (safe), yellow areas are within the zone of
   uncertainty (increasing risk), and red areas are beyond the zone of
   uncertainty (high risk). Gray areas in (A) and (B) are areas where P
   and N fertilizers are not applied; in (C), they are areas not covered
   by major forest biomes; and in (D), they are areas where river flow is
   very low so that environmental flows are not allocated. See Table 1 for
   values of the boundaries and their zones of uncertainty and (33) for
   more details on methods and results.

   We emphasize that our subglobal-level focus is based on the necessity
   to consider this level to understand the functioning of the Earth
   system as a whole. The PB framework is therefore meant to complement,
   not replace or supersede, efforts to address local and regional
   environmental issues.

Updates of the individual boundaries

   Brief updates of all nine of the PBs are given in this section, and
   more detailed descriptions of the updates for three of the PBs that
   have undergone more extensive revision can be found in (33). The
   geographical distribution issues discussed above are particularly
   important for five of the PBs, and their control variables and
   boundaries have been revised accordingly (Table 1). Figure 3 shows the
   current status of the seven boundaries that can be quantified at the
   global level.

   Fig. 3

   The current status of the control variables for seven of the nine
   planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space (below
   the boundary), yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing
   risk), and red is the high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself
   lies at the inner heavy circle. The control variables have been
   normalized for the zone of uncertainty (between the two heavy circles);
   the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for
   the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is
   atmospheric CO[2] concentration. Processes for which global-level
   boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges;
   these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the
   functional role of biosphere integrity. Modified from (1).

Climate change

   We retain the control variables and boundaries originally
   proposed—i.e., an atmospheric CO[2] concentration of 350 parts per
   million (ppm) and an increase in top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing of
   +1.0 W m^–2 relative to preindustrial levels (1). The radiative forcing
   control variable is the more inclusive and fundamental, although CO[2]
   is important because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere and the
   very large human emissions. Human-driven changes to radiative forcing
   include all anthropogenic factors: CO[2], other greenhouse gases,
   aerosols, and other factors that affect the energy balance (18).
   Radiative forcing is generally the more stringent of the two
   boundaries, although the relationship between it and CO[2] can vary
   through time with changes in the relative importance of the individual
   radiative forcing factors.

   Evidence has accumulated to suggest that the zone of uncertainty for
   the CO[2] control variable should be narrowed from 350 to 550 ppm to
   350 to 450 ppm CO[2] (17, 18), while retaining the current zone of
   uncertainty for radiative forcing of +1.0 to 1.5 W m^–2 relative to
   preindustrial levels. Current values of the control variables are 399
   ppm CO[2] (annual average concentration for 2014) (34) and +2.3 W m^–2
   (1.1 to 3.3 W m^–2) in 2011 relative to 1750 (18). Observed changes in
   climate at current levels of the control variables confirm the original
   choice of the boundary values and the narrowing of the zone of
   uncertainty for CO[2]. For example, there has already been an increase
   in the intensity, frequency, and duration of heat waves globally (35);
   the number of heavy rainfall events in many regions of the world is
   increasing (17); changes in atmospheric circulation patterns have
   increased drought in some regions of the world (17); and the rate of
   combined mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is
   increasing (36).

Changes in biosphere integrity

   We propose a two-component approach, addressing two key roles of the
   biosphere in the Earth system. The first captures the role of
   genetically unique material as the “information bank” that ultimately
   determines the potential for life to continue to coevolve with the
   abiotic component of the Earth system in the most resilient way
   possible. Genetic diversity provides the long-term capacity of the
   biosphere to persist under and adapt to abrupt and gradual abiotic
   change. The second captures the role of the biosphere in Earth-system
   functioning through the value, range, distribution, and relative
   abundance of the functional traits of the organisms present in an
   ecosystem or biota (7).

   For the first role, the concept of phylogenetic species variability
   (PSV) (7, 33, 37) would be an appropriate control variable. However,
   because global data are not yet available for PSV, we retain the global
   extinction rate as an interim control variable, although it is measured
   inaccurately and with a time lag. There may be a considerable risk in
   using extinction rate as a control variable, because phylogenetic (and
   functional) diversity may be more sensitive to human pressures than
   species-level diversity (38). In principle, the boundary should be set
   at a rate of loss of PSV no greater than the rate of evolution of new
   PSV during the Holocene. Because that is unknown, we must fall back on
   the (imperfectly) known extinction rate of well-studied organisms over
   the past several million years—about 1 per million species-years
   (39)—and add a large uncertainty bound, raising the boundary to 10 per
   million species-years. The risk is that, although the Earth system can
   tolerate a higher-than-background level of extinctions for a time, we
   do not know what levels of, or types of, biodiversity loss may possibly
   trigger nonlinear or irreversible changes to the Earth system.

   The second control variable aims to capture the role of the biosphere
   in Earth-system functioning and measures loss of biodiversity
   components at both global and biome/large ecosystem levels. Although
   several variables have been developed at local scales for measuring
   functional diversity [e.g., (40)], finding an appropriate control
   variable at regional or global levels is challenging. For the present,
   we propose an interim control variable, the Biodiversity Intactness
   Index (BII) (41). BII assesses change in population abundance as a
   result of human impacts, such as land or resource use, across a wide
   range of taxa and functional groups at a biome or ecosystem level using
   preindustrial era abundance as a reference point. The index typically
   ranges from 100% (abundances across all functional groups at
   preindustrial levels) to lower values that reflect the extent and
   degree of human modification of populations of plants and animals. BII
   values for particular functional groups can go above 100% if human
   modifications to ecosystems lead to increases in the abundance of those
   species.

   Due to a lack of evidence on the relationship between BII and
   Earth-system responses, we propose a preliminary boundary at 90% of the
   BII but with a very large uncertainty range (90 to 30%) that reflects
   the large gaps in our knowledge about the BII–Earth-system functioning
   relationship (42, 43). BII has been so far applied to southern Africa’s
   terrestrial biomes only (see fig. S3 for an estimation of aggregated
   human pressures on the terrestrial biosphere globally), where the index
   (not yet disaggregated to functional groups) was estimated to be 84%.
   BII ranged from 69 to 91% for the seven countries where it has been
   applied (41). Observations across these countries suggest that
   decreases in BII adequately capture increasing levels of ecosystem
   degradation, defined as land uses that do not alter the land-cover type
   but lead to a persistent loss in ecosystem productivity (41).

   In addition to further work on functional measures such as BII, in the
   longer term the concept of biome integrity—the functioning and
   persistence of biomes at broad scales (7)—offers a promising approach
   and, with further research, could provide a set of operational control
   variables (one per biome) that is appropriate, robust, and
   scientifically based.

Stratospheric ozone depletion

   We retain the original control variable [O[3] concentration in DU
   (Dobson units)] and boundary (275 DU). This boundary is only
   transgressed over Antarctica in the austral spring, when O[3]
   concentration drops to about 200 DU (44). However, the minimum O[3]
   concentration has been steady for about 15 years and is expected to
   rise over the coming decades as the ozone hole is repaired after the
   phasing out of ozone-depleting substances. This is an example in which,
   after a boundary has been transgressed regionally, humanity has taken
   effective action to return the process back to within the boundary.

Ocean acidification

   This boundary is intimately linked with one of the control variables,
   CO[2], for the climate change PB. The concentration of free H^+ ions in
   the surface ocean has increased by about 30% over the past 200 years
   due to the increase in atmospheric CO[2] (45). This, in turn,
   influences carbonate chemistry in surface ocean waters. Specifically,
   it lowers the saturation state of aragonite (Ω[arag]), a form of
   calcium carbonate formed by many marine organisms. At Ω[arag] < 1,
   aragonite will dissolve. No new evidence has emerged to suggest that
   the originally proposed boundary (≥80% of the preindustrial average
   annual global Ω[arag]) should be adjusted, although geographical
   heterogeneity in Ω[arag] is important in monitoring the state of the
   boundary around the world’s oceans (fig. S4). Currently, Ω[arag] is
   approximately equal to 84% of the preindustrial value (46). This
   boundary would not be transgressed if the climate-change boundary of
   350 ppm CO[2] were to be respected.

Biogeochemical flows

   The original boundary was formulated for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen
   (N) only, but we now propose a more generic PB to encompass human
   influence on biogeochemical flows in general. Although the carbon cycle
   is covered in the climate-change boundary, other elements, such as
   silicon (47, 48), are also important for Earth-system functioning.
   Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that ratios between elements
   in the environment may have impacts on biodiversity on land and in the
   sea (49–51). Thus, we may ultimately need to develop PBs for other
   elements and their ratios, although for now we focus on P and N only.

   A two-level approach is now proposed for the P component of the
   biogeochemical flows boundary (see also the supplementary materials).
   The original global-level boundary, based on the prevention of a
   large-scale ocean anoxic event, is retained, with the proposed boundary
   set at a sustained flow of 11 Tg P year^–1 from freshwater systems into
   the ocean. Based on the analysis of Carpenter and Bennett (3), we now
   propose an additional regional-level P boundary, designed to avert
   widespread eutrophication of freshwater systems, at a flow of 6.2 Tg P
   year^–1 from fertilizers (mined P) to erodible soils.

   Given that the addition of P to regional watersheds is almost entirely
   from fertilizers, the regional-level boundary applies primarily to the
   world’s croplands. The current global rate of application of P in
   fertilizers to croplands is 14.2 Tg P year^–1 (52, 53). Observations
   point toward a few agricultural regions of very high P application
   rates as the main contributors to the transgression of this boundary
   (Fig. 2 and fig. S5A) and suggest that a redistribution of P from areas
   where it is currently in excess to areas where the soil is naturally
   P-poor may simultaneously boost global crop production and reduce the
   transgression of the regional-level P boundary (3, 52, 54).

   The N boundary has been taken from the comprehensive analysis of de
   Vries et al. (5), which proposed a PB for eutrophication of aquatic
   ecosystems of 62 Tg N year^–1 from industrial and intentional
   biological N fixation, using the most stringent water quality
   criterion. As for the P boundary, a few agricultural regions of very
   high N application rates are the main contributors to the transgression
   of this boundary (Fig. 2 and fig. S5B). This suggests that a
   redistribution of N could simultaneously boost global crop production
   and reduce the transgression of the regional-level boundary.

   Because the major anthropogenic perturbation of both the N and P cycles
   arises from fertilizer application, we can analyze the links between
   the independently determined N and P boundaries in an integrated way
   based on the N:P ratio in the growing plant tissue of agricultural
   crops. Applying this ratio, which is on average 11.8 (55), to the P
   boundary (6.2 Tg P year^–1) gives an N boundary of 73 Tg N year^–1.
   Conversely, applying the ratio to the N boundary (62 Tg N year^–1)
   gives a P boundary of 5.3 Tg P year^–1. The small differences between
   the boundaries derived using the N:P ratio and those calculated
   independently, which are likely nonsignificant differences given the
   precision of the data available for the calculations, show the internal
   consistency in our approach to the biogeochemical boundaries.

   More detail on the development of the P and N boundaries is given in
   (33), where we also emphasize that the proposed P and N boundaries may
   be larger for an optimal allocation of N (and P) over the globe.

Land-system change

   The updated biosphere integrity boundary provides a considerable
   constraint on the amount and pattern of land-system change in all
   terrestrial biomes: forests, woodlands, savannas, grasslands,
   shrublands, tundra, and so on. The land-system change boundary is now
   focused more tightly on a specific constraint: the biogeophysical
   processes in land systems that directly regulate climate—exchange of
   energy, water, and momentum between the land surface and the
   atmosphere. The control variable has been changed from the amount of
   cropland to the amount of forest cover remaining, as the three major
   forest biomes—tropical, temperate and boreal—play a stronger role in
   land surface–climate coupling than other biomes (56, 57). In
   particular, we focus on those land-system changes that can influence
   the climate in regions beyond the region where the land-system change
   occurred.

   Of the forest biomes, tropical forests have substantial feedbacks to
   climate through changes in evapotranspiration when they are converted
   to nonforested systems, and changes in the distribution of boreal
   forests affect the albedo of the land surface and hence regional energy
   exchange. Both have strong regional and global teleconnections. The
   biome-level boundary for these two types of forest have been set at 85%
   (Table 1 and the supplementary materials), and the boundary for
   temperate forests has been proposed at 50% of potential forest cover,
   because changes to temperate forests are estimated to have weaker
   influences on the climate system at the global level than changes to
   the other two major forest biomes (56). These boundaries would almost
   surely be met if the proposed biosphere integrity boundary of 90% BII
   were respected.

   Estimates of the current status of the land-system change boundary are
   given in Figs. 2 and 3 and fig. S6 and in (58).

Freshwater use

   The revised freshwater use boundary has retained consumptive use of
   blue water [from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and renewable groundwater
   stores (59)] as the global-level control variable and 4000 km^3/year as
   the value of the boundary. This PB may be somewhat higher or lower
   depending on rivers’ ecological flow requirements (6). Therefore, we
   report here a new assessment to complement the PB with a basin-scale
   boundary for the maximum rate of blue water withdrawal along rivers,
   based on the amount of water required in the river system to avoid
   regime shifts in the functioning of flow-dependent ecosystems. We base
   our control variable on the concept of environmental water flows (EWF),
   which defines the level of river flows for different hydrological
   characteristics of river basins adequate to maintain a fair-to-good
   ecosystem state (60–62).

   The variable monthly flow (VMF) method (33, 63) was used to calculate
   the basin-scale boundary for water. This method takes account of
   intra-annual variability by classifying flow regimes into high-,
   intermediate-, and low-flow months and allocating EWF as a percentage
   of the mean monthly flow (MMF). Based on this analysis, the zones of
   uncertainty for the river-basin scale water boundary were set at 25 to
   55% of MMF for the low-flow regime, 40 to 70% for the intermediate-flow
   regime, and 55 to 85% for the high-flow regime (table S2). The
   boundaries were set at the lower end of the uncertainty ranges that
   encompass average monthly EWF. Our new estimates of the current status
   of the water use boundary—computed based on grid cell–specific
   estimates of agricultural, industrial, and domestic water
   withdrawals—are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, with details in figs. S7 and
   S8.

Atmospheric aerosol loading

   Aerosols have well-known, serious human health effects, leading to
   about 7.2 million deaths per year (64). They also affect the
   functioning of the Earth system in many ways (65) (fig. S9). Here,we
   focus on the effect of aerosols on regional ocean-atmosphere
   circulation as the rationale for a separate aerosols boundary. We adopt
   aerosol optical depth (AOD) (33) as the control variable and use the
   south Asian monsoon as a case study, based on the potential of
   widespread aerosol loading over the Indian subcontinent to switch the
   monsoon system to a drier state.

   The background AOD over south Asia is ~0.15 and can be as high as 0.4
   during volcanic events (66). Emissions of black carbon and organic
   carbon from cooking and heating with biofuels and from diesel
   transportation, and emission of sulfates and nitrates from fossil fuel
   combustion, can increase seasonal mean AODs to as high as 0.4 (larger
   during volcanic periods), leading to decreases of 10 to 15% of incident
   solar radiation at the surface (fig. S9). A substantial decrease in
   monsoon activity is likely around an AOD of 0.50, an increase of 0.35
   above the background (67). Taking a precautionary approach toward
   uncertainties surrounding the position of the tipping point, we propose
   a boundary at an AOD of 0.25 (an increase due to human activities of
   0.1), with a zone of uncertainty of 0.25 to 0.50. The annual mean AOD
   is currently about 0.3 (66), within the zone of uncertainty.

Introduction of novel entities

   We define novel entities as new substances, new forms of existing
   substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for
   unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects. Anthropogenic
   introduction of novel entities to the environment is of concern at the
   global level when these entities exhibit (i) persistence, (ii) mobility
   across scales with consequent widespread distributions, and (iii)
   potential impacts on vital Earth-system processes or subsystems. These
   potentially include chemicals and other new types of engineered
   materials or organisms [e.g., (68–71)] not previously known to the
   Earth system, as well as naturally occurring elements (for example,
   heavy metals) mobilized by anthropogenic activities. The risks
   associated with the introduction of novel entities into the Earth
   system are exemplified by the release of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons),
   which are very useful synthetic chemicals that were thought to be
   harmless but had unexpected, dramatic impacts on the stratospheric
   ozone layer. In effect, humanity is repeatedly running such
   global-scale experiments but not yet applying the insights from
   previous experience to new applications (72, 73).

   Today there are more than 100,000 substances in global commerce (74).
   If nanomaterials and plastic polymers that degrade to microplastics are
   included, the list is even longer. There is also a “chemical
   intensification” due to the rapidly increasing global production of
   chemicals, the expanding worldwide distribution as chemical products or
   in consumer goods, and the extensive global trade in chemical wastes
   (75).

   In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the global-scale
   effects of chemical pollution, leading to calls for the definition of
   criteria to identify the kinds of chemical substances that are likely
   to be globally problematic (76, 77). Persson et al. (73) proposed that
   there are three conditions that need to be fulfilled for a chemical to
   pose a threat to the Earth system: (i) the chemical has an unknown
   disruptive effect on a vital Earth-system process; (ii) the disruptive
   effect is not discovered until it is a problem at the global scale; and
   (iii) the effect is not readily reversible. The challenge to the
   research community is to develop the knowledge base that allows the
   screening of chemicals, before they are released into the environment,
   for properties that may predispose them toward becoming global
   problems.

   As a first step toward meeting this challenge, the three conditions
   outlined above have been used as the basis for identifying scenarios of
   chemical pollution that fulfill the conditions and as a next step for
   pinpointing chemical profiles that fit the scenarios (28). This
   proposal constitutes a first attempt at adding the Earth-system
   perspective when assessing hazard and risk of chemicals and offers a
   vision for a systematic approach to a complex management situation with
   many unknowns.

   Despite this progress in developing an Earth-system–oriented approach,
   there is not yet an aggregate, global-level analysis of chemical
   pollution on which to base a control variable or a boundary value. It
   may also serve little purpose to define boundary values and control
   variables for a planetary boundary of this complexity. Nevertheless,
   there is a potential threat from novel entities to disrupt the
   functioning of the Earth-system and society needs to learn how to
   mitigate these unknown risks and manage chemicals under uncertainty
   (28, 73).

   Some precautionary and preventive actions can be considered. These may
   include a stronger focus on green chemistry (78), finding synergies
   with risk-reducing interventions in other fields such as occupational
   health (79), paying more attention to learning from earlier mistakes
   (80, 81), and investing in science to better understand and monitor
   vital Earth-system processes in order to be able to detect disruptive
   effects from novel entities as early as possible.

Hierarchy of boundaries

   An analysis of the many interactions among the boundaries (table S3 and
   fig. S10) suggests that two of them—climate change and biosphere
   integrity—are highly integrated, emergent system-level phenomena that
   are connected to all of the other PBs. They operate at the level of the
   whole Earth system (7) and have coevolved for nearly 4 billion years
   (82). They are regulated by the other boundaries and, on the other
   hand, provide the planetary-level overarching systems within which the
   other boundary processes operate. Furthermore, large changes in the
   climate or in biosphere integrity would likely, on their own, push the
   Earth system out of the Holocene state. In fact, transitions between
   time periods in Earth history have often been delineated by substantial
   shifts in climate, the biosphere, or both (82, 83).

   These observations suggest a two-level hierarchy of boundaries, in
   which climate change and biosphere integrity should be recognized as
   core planetary boundaries through which the other boundaries operate.
   The crossing of one or more of the other boundaries may seriously
   affect human well-being and may predispose the transgression of a core
   boundary(ies) but does not by itself lead to a new state of the Earth
   system. This hierarchical approach to classifying the boundaries
   becomes clearer by examining in more detail the roles of climate and
   biosphere integrity in the functioning of the Earth system.

   The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and
   net balance of energy at Earth’s surface. The total amount of energy
   sets the overall conditions for life. In Earth’s current climate, a
   range of global surface temperatures and atmospheric pressures allows
   the three phases of water to be present simultaneously, with ice and
   water vapor playing critical roles in the physical feedbacks of the
   climate system. The distribution of energy by latitude, over the land
   and sea surfaces, and within the ocean plays a major role in the
   circulation of the two great fluids, the ocean and the atmosphere.
   These systemic physical characteristics are key spatial determinants of
   the distribution of the biota and the structure and functioning of
   ecosystems and are controllers of biogeochemical flows.

   Biosphere integrity is also crucial to Earth-system functioning, where
   the biosphere is defined as the totality of all ecosystems
   (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine) on Earth and their biota (32).
   These ecosystems and biota play a critical role in determining the
   state of the Earth system, regulating its material and energy flows and
   its responses to abrupt and gradual change (7). Diversity in the
   biosphere provides resilience to terrestrial and marine ecosystems (83,
   84). The biosphere not only interacts with the other planetary
   boundaries but also increases the capacity of the Earth system to
   persist in a given state under changes in these other boundaries. The
   ultimate basis for the many roles that the biosphere plays in
   Earth-system dynamics is the genetic code of the biota, the basic
   information bank that defines the biosphere’s functional role and its
   capacity to innovate and persist into the future.

Planetary boundaries in a societal context

   A proposed approach for sustainable development goals (SDGs) (85)
   argues that the stable functioning of the Earth system is a
   prerequisite for thriving societies around the world. This approach
   implies that the PB framework, or something like it, will need to be
   implemented alongside the achievement of targets aimed at more
   immediate human needs, such as provision of clean, affordable, and
   accessible energy and the adequate supply of food. World development
   within the biophysical limits of a stable Earth system has always been
   a necessity [e.g., (86, 87)]. However, only recently, for a number of
   reasons, has it become possible to identify, evaluate, and quantify
   risks of abrupt planetary- and biome-level shifts due to overshoot of
   key Earth-system parameters: (i) the emergence of global-change
   thinking and Earth-system thinking (88); (ii) the rise of “the
   Planetary” as a relevant level of complex system understanding (89–92);
   and (iii) observable effects of the rapid increase in human pressures
   on the planet (16).

   The PB approach is embedded in this emerging social context, but it
   does not suggest how to maneuver within the safe operating space in the
   quest for global sustainability. For example, the PB framework does not
   as yet account for the regional distribution of the impact or its
   historical patterns. Nor does the PB framework take into account the
   deeper issues of equity and causation. The current levels of the
   boundary processes, and the transgressions of boundaries that have
   already occurred, are unevenly caused by different human societies and
   different social groups. The wealth benefits that these transgressions
   have brought are also unevenly distributed socially and geographically.
   It is easy to foresee that uneven distribution of causation and
   benefits will continue, and these differentials must surely be
   addressed for a Holocene-like Earth-system state to be successfully
   legitimated and maintained. However, the PB framework as currently
   construed provides no guidance as to how this may be achieved [although
   some potential synergies have been noted (54)], and it cannot readily
   be used to make choices between pathways for piecemeal maneuvering
   within the safe operating space or more radical shifts of global
   governance (93).

   The nature of the PB framework implies that two important cautions
   should be observed when application of the framework to policy or
   management is proposed: boundary interactions and scale.

Boundary interactions

   The planetary boundaries framework arises from the scientific evidence
   that Earth is a single, complex, integrated system—that is, the
   boundaries operate as an interdependent set [e.g., (94)] (table S1 and
   fig. S10). Although a systematic, quantitative analysis of interactions
   among all of the processes for which boundaries are proposed remains
   beyond the scope of current modeling and observational capacity, the
   Earth system clearly operates in well-defined states in which these
   processes and their interactions can create stabilizing or
   destabilizing feedbacks (16, 90, 95). This has profound implications
   for global sustainability, because it emphasizes the need to address
   multiple interacting environmental processes simultaneously (e.g.,
   stabilizing the climate system requires sustainable forest management
   and stable ocean ecosystems).

Scale

   The PB framework is not designed to be “downscaled” or “disaggregated”
   to smaller levels, such as nations or local communities. That said, the
   PB framework recognizes the importance of changes at the level of
   subsystems in the Earth system (e.g., biomes or large river basins) on
   the functioning of the Earth system as a whole. Also, there are strong
   arguments for an integrated approach coupling boundary definitions at
   regional and global levels with development goals to enable the
   application of “PB thinking” at levels (nations, basins, and regions)
   where policy action most commonly occurs [e.g., (85, 96)].

   This update of the PB framework is one step on a longer-term evolution
   of scientific knowledge to inform and support global sustainability
   goals and pathways. This evolution is needed more than ever before;
   there are severe implementation gaps in many global environmental
   policies relating to the PB issues, where problematic trends are not
   being halted or reversed despite international consensus about the
   urgency of the problems. The prospect of tighter resource constraints
   and rising environmental hazards is also unavoidably turning the focus
   onto global social equity and the planetary stewardship of Earth’s
   life-support system. There is a need for a truly global evidence base,
   with much greater integration among issues, in order to respond to
   these global challenges. New research initiatives [e.g., Future Earth
   (www.futureearth.org)] provide evidence that science can respond to
   this need by applying Earth-system research to advance a new generation
   of integrated global analyses and to explore options for
   transformations toward sustainability. This is a clear sign that, as
   the risks of the Anthropocene to human well-being become clearer,
   research is maturing to a point where a systemic step-change is
   possible—and necessary—in exploring and defining a safe and just
   planetary operating space for the further development of human
   societies.

Methods summary

   Our approach to building the planetary boundaries framework is
   described above. We have implemented the framework through an expert
   assessment and synthesis of the scientific knowledge of intrinsic
   biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system.
   Our precautionary approach is based on the maintenance of a
   Holocene-like state of the Earth system and on an assessment of the
   level of human-driven change that would risk destabilizing this state.
   For the climate change PB, there is already much literature on which to
   base such an assessment. For others, such as stratospheric ozone, ocean
   acidification, extinction rates, and P and N cycles, we have used
   estimates of preindustrial values of the control variable as a Holocene
   baseline. Where large, undesirable thresholds exist and have been
   studied (e.g., polar ice sheets, Amazon rainforest, aragonite
   dissolution, atmospheric aerosols, and the south Asian monsoon),
   quantitative boundaries can be readily proposed. For others, where the
   focus is on erosion of Earth-system resilience, the boundaries are more
   difficult (but not impossible) to quantify, as reflected in larger
   uncertainty zones.

   We used large-scale assessments of the impacts of human activities on
   Earth-system functioning [e.g., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (17, 18), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
   synthesis (16), and chemicals (75, 80)] as sources of community-level
   understanding on which to propose PBs. Our update has also relied on
   post-2009 assessments of individual boundaries by the relevant expert
   research communities; examples include phosphorus (3), nitrogen (5),
   biosphere integrity (7), freshwater use (5, 63), and novel entities
   [with a focus on chemicals (28, 73)]. Finally, some new analyses have
   been undertaken specifically for this paper: (i) a freshwater-use PB
   based on the EWF approach (33, 63); (ii) the linkage of the phosphorus
   and nitrogen boundaries via the N:P ratio in growing crop tissue (33);
   and (iii) the use of major forest biomes as the basis for the
   land-system change PB (33).

   Puerto Rico is not prepared for another hurricane. A year ago,
   Hurricane María obliterated the island's electric grid, leading to the
   longest power outage in U.S. history. This disrupted medical care for
   thousands and contributed to an estimated 2975 deaths. The hurricane
   caused over $90 billion in damage for an island already in economic
   crisis. Although authorities claim that power was restored completely,
   some residents still lack electricity. Despite recovery efforts, the
   continued vulnerability of the energy infrastructure threatens Puerto
   Rico's future. But disruptions create possibilities for change.
   Hurricane María brought an opportunity to move away from a fossil
   fuel–dominant system and establish instead a decentralized system that
   generates energy with clean and renewable sources. This is the path
   that will bring resilience to Puerto Rico.

     “…moving away from dependency on imported fossil fuels should be the
     guiding vision.”

   Puerto Rico is representative of the Caribbean islands that rely
   heavily on fossil fuels for electric power; 98% of its electricity
   comes from imported fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), whereas
   only 2% comes from renewable sources (solar, wind, or hydroelectric).
   The distribution of 6023 MW is challenging, requiring thousands of
   miles of transmission and distribution lines over the island's steep
   topography. This makes the island's centralized electrical grid
   vulnerable to hurricanes that are predicted to increase in severity
   because of climate change.

   In Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean, where sun, wind, water,
   and biomass are abundant sources of renewable energy, there is no need
   to rely on fossil fuel technology. Unfortunately, the government of
   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency have been
   making decisions about the local power authority that are restoring the
   energy system to what it was before Hurricane María hit, perpetuating
   fossil fuel reliance.

   Despite these decisions, a transformation has begun in communities
   across Puerto Rico. For example, in the mountain municipality of
   Adjuntas, local initiatives headed by Casa Pueblo, a self-reliant
   nonprofit community organization, has increased the installation of
   solar energy systems. Fortunately, the solar power–based infrastructure
   of Casa Pueblo was not affected by the hurricane, allowing Adjuntas to
   serve as the organization's center of operations for immediate local
   and regional response after the hurricane. Adjuntas became an oasis of
   power, where people got immediate assistance. Analog solar-based energy
   systems were designed and installed by Casa Pueblo to supply the needs
   of numerous entities in the community: medical equipment, such as
   peritoneal dialysis for homes with patients; a radio transmitter for a
   community radio station; and equipment for hardware stores,
   minimarkets, restaurants, and other businesses. Around the island,
   other examples of off-the-grid local energy production reflect
   community resilience grounded in projects that foster renewable energy.
   They include a solar microgrid in Orocovis, multiple community
   aqueducts, and sustainable farms. These new energy systems are changing
   the energy landscape of the municipality. But the majority of rural
   communities is still in need of sustained help.

   At this juncture, when the opportunity to build a sustainable and
   resilient electrical system presents itself, moving away from
   dependency on imported fossil fuels should be the guiding vision.
   Puerto Rico must embrace the renewable endogenous sources that abound
   on the island and build robust microgrids powered by solar and wind,
   install hybrid systems (such as biomass biodigesters), and create
   intelligent networks that can increase the resilience of the island.
   The Puerto Rican government and U.S. Congress should use Hurricane
   María as a turning point for pushing Puerto Rico toward using 100%
   renewable energy rather than a platform to plant generators across the
   island. The Fiscal Plans approved and certified by the Financial
   Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, created by Congress in
   2016, should be amended to pursue this vision of sustainable
   development based on renewable energy.

Abstract

   Neandertals, the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day humans,
   lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before disappearing
   30,000 years ago. We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome
   composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals.
   Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day
   humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic
   regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
   modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
   and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic
   variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day
   humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from
   Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the
   divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.

   The morphological features typical of Neandertals first appear in the
   European fossil record about 400,000 years ago (1–3). Progressively
   more distinctive Neandertal forms subsequently evolved until
   Neandertals disappeared from the fossil record about 30,000 years ago
   (4). During the later part of their history, Neandertals lived in
   Europe and Western Asia as far east as Southern Siberia (5) and as far
   south as the Middle East. During that time, Neandertals presumably came
   into contact with anatomically modern humans in the Middle East from at
   least 80,000 years ago (6, 7) and subsequently in Europe and Asia.

   Neandertals are the sister group of all present-day humans. Thus,
   comparisons of the human genome to the genomes of Neandertals and apes
   allow features that set fully anatomically modern humans apart from
   other hominin forms to be identified. In particular, a Neandertal
   genome sequence provides a catalog of changes that have become fixed or
   have risen to high frequency in modern humans during the last few
   hundred thousand years and should be informative for identifying genes
   affected by positive selection since humans diverged from Neandertals.

   Substantial controversy surrounds the question of whether Neandertals
   interbred with anatomically modern humans. Morphological features of
   present-day humans and early anatomically modern human fossils have
   been interpreted as evidence both for (8, 9) and against (10, 11)
   genetic exchange between Neandertals and the presumed ancestors of
   present-day Europeans. Similarly, analysis of DNA sequence data from
   present-day humans has been interpreted as evidence both for (12, 13)
   and against (14) a genetic contribution by Neandertals to present-day
   humans. The only part of the genome that has been examined from
   multiple Neandertals, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome,
   consistently falls outside the variation found in present-day humans
   and thus provides no evidence for interbreeding (15–19). However, this
   observation does not preclude some amount of interbreeding (14, 19) or
   the possibility that Neandertals contributed other parts of their
   genomes to present-day humans (16). In contrast, the nuclear genome is
   composed of tens of thousands of recombining, and hence independently
   evolving, DNA segments that provide an opportunity to obtain a clearer
   picture of the relationship between Neandertals and present-day humans.

   A challenge in detecting signals of gene flow between Neandertals and
   modern human ancestors is that the two groups share common ancestors
   within the last 500,000 years, which is no deeper than the nuclear DNA
   sequence variation within present-day humans. Thus, even if no gene
   flow occurred, in many segments of the genome, Neandertals are expected
   to be more closely related to some present-day humans than they are to
   each other (20). However, if Neandertals are, on average across many
   independent regions of the genome, more closely related to present-day
   humans in certain parts of the world than in others, this would
   strongly suggest that Neandertals exchanged parts of their genome with
   the ancestors of these groups.

   Several features of DNA extracted from Late Pleistocene remains make
   its study challenging. The DNA is invariably degraded to a small
   average size of less than 200 base pairs (bp) (21, 22), it is
   chemically modified (21, 23–26), and extracts almost always contain
   only small amounts of endogenous DNA but large amounts of DNA from
   microbial organisms that colonized the specimens after death. Over the
   past 20 years, methods for ancient DNA retrieval have been developed
   (21, 22), largely based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (27). In
   the case of the nuclear genome of Neandertals, four short gene
   sequences have been determined by PCR: fragments of the MC1R gene
   involved in skin pigmentation (28), a segment of the FOXP2 gene
   involved in speech and language (29), parts of the ABO blood group
   locus (30), and a taste receptor gene (31). However, although PCR of
   ancient DNA can be multiplexed (32), it does not allow the retrieval of
   a large proportion of the genome of an organism.

   The development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies (33, 34)
   allows large-scale, genome-wide sequencing of random pieces of DNA
   extracted from ancient specimens (35–37) and has recently made it
   feasible to sequence genomes from late Pleistocene species (38).
   However, because a large proportion of the DNA present in most fossils
   is of microbial origin, comparison to genome sequences of closely
   related organisms is necessary to identify the DNA molecules that
   derive from the organism under study (39). In the case of Neandertals,
   the finished human genome sequence and the chimpanzee genome offer the
   opportunity to identify Neandertal DNA sequences (39, 40).

   A special challenge in analyzing DNA sequences from the Neandertal
   nuclear genome is that most DNA fragments in a Neandertal are expected
   to be identical to present-day humans (41). Thus, contamination of the
   experiments with DNA from present-day humans may be mistaken for
   endogenous DNA. We first applied high-throughput sequencing to
   Neandertal specimens from Vindija Cave in Croatia (40, 42), a site from
   which cave bear remains yielded some of the first nuclear DNA sequences
   from the late Pleistocene in 1999 (43). Close to one million bp of
   nuclear DNA sequences from one bone were directly determined by
   high-throughput sequencing on the 454 platform (40), whereas DNA
   fragments from another extract from the same bone were cloned in a
   plasmid vector and used to sequence ~65,000 bp (42). These experiments,
   while demonstrating the feasibility of generating a Neandertal genome
   sequence, were preliminary in that they involved the transfer of DNA
   extracts prepared in a clean-room environment to conventional
   laboratories for processing and sequencing, creating an opportunity for
   contamination by present-day human DNA. Further analysis of the larger
   of these data sets (40) showed that it was contaminated with modern
   human DNA (44) to an extent of 11 to 40% (41). We employed a number of
   technical improvements, including the attachment of tagged sequence
   adaptors in the clean-room environment (23), to minimize the risk of
   contamination and determine about 4 billion bp from the Neandertal
   genome.

   Paleontological samples. We analyzed a total of 21 Neandertal bones
   from Vindija Cave in Croatia that are of little morphological value.
   From below the surface of each of these bones, we removed 50 to 100 mg
   of bone powder using a sterile dentistry drill in our Leipzig
   clean-room facility. All samples were screened for the presence of
   Neandertal mtDNA by PCR, and three bones were selected for further
   analysis (Fig. 1A) [Supporting Online Material (SOM) Text 2]. The first
   of these bones, Vi33.16 (previously Vi-80) was discovered in
   stratigraphic layer G3 by Malez and co-workers in 1980 and has been
   directly dated by carbon-14 accelerator mass spectrometry to 38,310 ±
   2,130 years before the present (B.P.) (uncalibrated) (19). It has been
   previously used for genome sequencing (40, 42) and for the
   determination of a complete mtDNA sequence (45). The second bone,
   Vi33.25, comes from layer I, which is deeper and thus older than layer
   G. A complete mtDNA sequence has been determined from this bone (15).
   It does not contain enough collagen to allow a direct date. The third
   bone, Vi33.26, comes from layer G (sublayer unknown) and has not been
   previously used for large-scale DNA sequencing. It was directly dated
   to 44,450 ± 550 years B.P. (OxA-V-2291-18, uncalibrated).

   the four archaeological sites from which bones were used and their
   approximate dates (years B.P.).

   Sequencing library construction. A total of nine DNA extracts were
   prepared from the three bones (table S4) using procedures to minimize
   laboratory contamination that we have developed over the past two
   decades (22, 41). Samples of each extract were used to construct
   Roche/454 sequencing libraries that carry the project-specific tag
   sequence 5′-TGAC-3′ in their 3′-ends. Each library was amplified with
   the primers used in the 454 sequencing emulsion PCR process. To
   estimate the percentage of endogenous Neandertal DNA in the extracts,
   we carried out sequencing runs using the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX
   platform and mapped the reads against the human, chimpanzee, rhesus,
   and mouse genomes as well as all nucleotide sequences in GenBank. DNA
   sequences with a significantly better match to the primate genomes than
   to any of the other sources of sequences were further analyzed.
   Mitochondrial DNA contamination from modern humans was estimated by
   primer extension capture (46) using six biotinylated primers that
   target informative differences between human and Neandertal mtDNA (45),
   followed by sequencing on the GS FLX platform. Extracts that contained
   more than 1.5% hominin DNA relative to other DNA were used to construct
   further libraries. These were similarly analyzed to assess the
   percentage of hominin DNA and, if found suitable, were used for
   production sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX/Titanium and
   Illumina GAII platforms.

   Enrichment of Neandertal DNA. Depending on the extract, between 95 and
   99% of the DNA sequenced in the libraries was derived from nonprimate
   organisms, which are presumably derived from microbes that colonized
   the bone after the death of the Neandertals. To improve the ratio of
   Neandertal to microbial DNA, we identified restriction enzymes that
   preferentially cut bacterial DNA sequences in the libraries and treated
   the libraries with these to increase the relative proportion of
   Neandertal DNA in the libraries (SOM Text 1). Such enzymes, which have
   recognition sites rich in the dinucleotide CpG, allowed a 4- to 6-fold
   increase in the proportion of Neandertal DNA in the libraries
   sequenced. This is expected to bias the sequencing against GC-rich
   regions of the genome and is therefore not suitable for arriving at a
   complete Neandertal genome sequence. However, for producing an overview
   of the genome at about one-fold coverage, it drastically increases the
   efficiency of data production without unduly biasing coverage,
   especially in view of the fact that GC-rich sequences are
   overrepresented in ancient DNA sequencing libraries (23, 45) so that
   the restriction enzyme treatment may help to counteract this bias.

   Sequencing platforms and alignments. In the initial phase of the
   project, we optimized DNA extraction technology and library
   construction [e.g., (47)]. In a second phase, we carried out production
   sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX platform from the bones
   Vi33.16 and Vi33.26 (0.5 Gb and 0.8 Gb of Neandertal sequence,
   respectively). In the third phase, we carried out production sequencing
   on the Illumina/Solexa GAII platform from the bones Vi33.16, Vi33.25,
   and Vi33.26 (1.2 Gb, 1.3 Gb, and 1.5 Gb, respectively) (table S4). Each
   molecule was sequenced from both ends (SOM Text 2), and bases were
   called with the machine learning algorithm Ibis (48). All reads were
   required to carry correct clean-room tags, and previous data where
   these tags were not used (40, 42) were not included in this study.
   Except when explicitly stated, the analyses below are based on the
   largest data sets, generated on the Illumina platform. In total, we
   generated 5.3 Gb of Neandertal DNA sequence from about 400 mg of bone
   powder. Thus, methods for extracting and sequencing DNA from ancient
   bones are now efficient enough to allow genome-wide DNA sequence
   coverage with relatively minor damage to well-preserved paleontological
   specimens.

   The dominant type of nucleotide misincorporation when ancient DNA is
   amplified and sequenced is due to deamination of cytosine residues
   (25). This causes C to T transitions in the DNA sequences, particularly
   toward the 5′-ends of DNA reads, where at the first position ~40% of
   cytosine residues can appear as thymine residues. The frequency of C to
   T misincorporations progressively diminishes further into the
   molecules. At the 3′-ends, complementary G to A transitions are seen as
   a result of the enzymatic fill-in procedure in which blunt DNA ends are
   created before adaptor ligation (23). We implemented an alignment
   approach that takes these nucleotide misincorporation patterns into
   account (SOM Text 3) and aligned the Neandertal sequences to either the
   reference human genome (UCSC hg18), the reference chimpanzee genome
   (panTro2), or the inferred human-chimpanzee common ancestral sequence
   (SOM Text 3).

   To estimate the error rate in the Neandertal DNA sequences determined,
   we compared reads that map to the mitochondrial genomes, which we
   assembled to 35-, 29- and 72-fold coverage for each of the bones,
   respectively (15, 45) (SOM Text 4). Although C to T and G to A
   substitutions, which are caused by deaminated cytosine residues, occur
   at a rate of 4.5 to 5.9%, other error rates are at most 0.3% (fig. S4).
   Because we sequence each DNA fragment from both sides, and most
   fragments more than once (49), the latter error rate is substantially
   lower than the error rate of the Illumina platform itself (48, 50).

   Number of Neandertal individuals. To assess whether the three bones
   come from different individuals, we first used their mtDNAs. We have
   previously determined the complete mtDNA sequences from the bones
   Vi33.16 and Vi33.25 (15, 45), and these differ at 10 positions.
   Therefore, Vi33.16 and Vi33.25 come from different Neandertal
   individuals. For the bone Vi33.26, we assembled the mtDNA sequence (SOM
   Text 4) and found it to be indistinguishable from Vi33.16, suggesting
   that it could come from the same individual. We analyzed autosomal DNA
   sequences from the three bones (SOM Text 4) by asking whether the
   frequency of nucleotide differences between pairs of bones was
   significantly higher than the frequency of differences within the
   bones. We find that the within-bone differences are significantly fewer
   than the between-bone differences for all three comparisons (P ≤ 0.001
   in all cases). Thus, all three bones derive from different individuals,
   although Vi33.16 and Vi33.26 may stem from maternally related
   individuals.

   Estimates of human DNA contamination. We used three approaches that
   target mtDNA, Y chromosomal DNA, and nuclear DNA, respectively, to
   gauge the ratio of present-day human relative to Neandertal DNA in the
   data produced. To analyze the extent of mtDNA contamination, we used
   the complete mtDNA from each bone to identify positions differing from
   at least 99% of a worldwide panel of 311 contemporary human mtDNAs,
   ignoring positions where a substitution in the sequences from the
   Neandertal library could be due to cytosine deamination (45). For each
   sequencing library, the DNA fragments that cover these positions were
   then classified according to whether they appear to be of Neandertal or
   modern human origin (SOM Text 5 and table S15). For each bone, the
   level of mtDNA contamination is estimated to be below 0.5% (Table 1).

   Because prior to this study no fixed differences between Neandertal and
   present-day humans in the nuclear genome were known, we used two
   alternative strategies to estimate levels of nuclear contamination. In
   the first strategy, we determined the sex of the bones. For bones
   derived from female Neandertals, we then estimated modern human male
   DNA contamination by looking for the presence of Y chromosomal DNA
   fragments (SOM Text 6). For this purpose, we identified 111,132
   nucleotides in the nonrecombining parts of the human reference Y
   chromosome that are located in contiguous DNA segments of at least 500
   nucleotides, carry no repetitive elements, and contain no 30-nucleotide
   oligomer elsewhere in the genome with fewer than three mismatches.
   Between 482 and 611 such fragments would be expected for a male
   Neandertal bone. However, only 0 to 4 fragments are observed (Table 1).
   We conclude that the three bones are all from female Neandertals and
   that previous suggestions that Vi33.16 was a male (40, 42) were due to
   mismapping of autosomal and X chromosomal reads to the Y chromosome. We
   estimate the extent of DNA contamination from modern human males in the
   combined data to be about 0.60%, with an upper 95% bound of 1.53%.

   In the second strategy, we take advantage of the fact that sites where
   present-day humans carry a high frequency of a derived allele (i.e.,
   not seen in chimpanzee) while Neandertals carry a high frequency of the
   ancestral allele (i.e., matching the chimpanzee) provide information
   about the extent of contamination. To implement this idea, we
   identified sites where five present-day humans that we sequenced (see
   below) all differ from the chimpanzee genome by a transversion. We
   further restricted the analysis to sites covered by two fragments in
   one Neandertal and one fragment in another Neandertal and where at
   least one ancestral allele was seen in both individuals. The additional
   fragment from the first Neandertal then provides an estimate of
   contamination in combination with heterozygosity at this class of sites
   (Table 1). Using these data (SOM Text 7), we derive a maximum
   likelihood estimate of contamination of 0.7% with an upper 95% bound of
   0.8%.

   In summary, all three measurements of human mtDNA contamination produce
   estimates of less than 1% contamination. Thus, the vast majority of
   these data represent bona fide Neandertal DNA sequences.

   Average DNA divergence between Neandertals and humans. To estimate the
   DNA sequence divergence per base pair between the genomes of
   Neandertals and the reference human genome sequence, we generated
   three-way alignments between the Neandertal, human, and chimpanzee
   genomes, filtering out genomic regions that may be duplicated in either
   humans or chimpanzees (SOM Text 10) and using an inferred genome
   sequence of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees as a
   reference (51) to avoid potential biases (39). We then counted the
   number of substitutions specific to the Neandertal, the human, and the
   chimpanzee genomes (Fig. 2). The overall number of substitutions unique
   to the Neandertal genome is about 30 times as high as on the human
   lineage. Because these are largely due to transitions resulting from
   deamination of cytosine residues in the Neandertal DNA, we restricted
   the divergence estimates to transversions. We then observed four to six
   times as many on the Neandertal as on the human lineage, probably due
   to sequencing errors in the low-coverage Neandertal DNA sequences. The
   numbers of transversions on the human lineage, as well as those on the
   lineage from the Neandertal-human ancestor to the chimpanzee, were used
   to estimate the average divergence between DNA sequences in Neandertals
   and present-day humans, as a fraction of the lineage from the human
   reference genome to the common ancestor of Neandertals, humans, and
   chimpanzees. For autosomes, this was 12.7% for each of the three bones
   analyzed. For the X chromosome, it was 11.9 to 12.4% (table S26).
   Assuming an average DNA divergence of 6.5 million years between the
   human and chimpanzee genomes (52), this results in a point estimate for
   the average divergence of Neandertal and modern human autosomal DNA
   sequences of 825,000 years. We caution that this is only a rough
   estimate because of the uncertainty about the time of divergence of
   humans and chimpanzees.

   ancestor of these to the chimpanzee. For each lineage and each bone
   from Vindija, the distributions and numbers of substitutions are shown.
   The excess of C to T and G to A substitutions are due to deamination of
   cytosine residues in the Neandertal DNA.

   Additional Neandertal individuals. To put the divergence of the
   Neandertal genome sequences from Vindija Cave into perspective with
   regard to other Neandertals, we generated a much smaller amount of DNA
   sequence data from three Neandertal bones from three additional sites
   (SOM Text 8) that cover much of the geographical range of late
   Neandertals (Fig. 1B): El Sidron in Asturias, Spain, dated to ~49,000
   years B.P. (53); Feldhofer Cave in the Neander Valley, Germany, from
   which we sequenced the type specimen found in 1856 dated to ~42,000
   years B.P. (54); and Mezmaiskaya Cave in the Caucasus, Russia, dated to
   60,000 to 70,000 years B.P. (55). DNA divergences estimated for each of
   these specimens to the human reference genome (table S26) show that
   none of them differ significantly from the Vindija individuals,
   although these estimates are relatively uncertain due to the limited
   amount of DNA sequence data. It is noteworthy that the Mezmaiskaya
   specimen, which is 20,000 to 30,000 years older than the other
   Neandertals analyzed and comes from the easternmost location, does not
   differ in divergence from the other individuals. Thus, within the
   resolution of our current data, Neandertals from across a great part of
   their range in western Eurasia are equally related to present-day
   humans.

   Five present-day human genomes. To put the divergence of the Neandertal
   genomes into perspective with regard to present-day humans, we
   sequenced the genomes of one San from Southern Africa, one Yoruba from
   West Africa, one Papua New Guinean, one Han Chinese, and one French
   from Western Europe to 4- to 6-fold coverage on the Illumina GAII
   platform (SOM Text 9). These sequences were aligned to the chimpanzee
   and human reference genomes and analyzed using a similar approach to
   that used for the Neandertal data. Autosomal DNA sequences of these
   individuals diverged 8.2 to 10.3% back along the lineage leading to the
   human reference genome, considerably less than the 12.7% seen in
   Neandertals (SOM Text 10). We note that the divergence estimate for the
   Yoruba individual to the human genome sequence is ~14% greater than
   previous estimates for an African American individual (56) and
   similarly greater than the heterozygosity measured in another Yoruba
   individual (33). This may be due to differences in the alignment and
   filtering procedures between this and previous studies (SOM Text 9 and
   10). Nevertheless, the divergence of the Neandertal genome to the human
   reference genome is greater than for any of the present-day human
   genomes analyzed.

   Distributions of DNA divergences to humans. To explore the variation of
   DNA sequence divergence across the genome, we analyzed the divergence
   of the Neandertals and the five humans to the reference human genome in
   100 kilobase windows for which at least 50 informative transversions
   were observed. The majority of the Neandertal divergences overlap with
   those of the humans (Fig. 3), reflecting the fact that Neandertals fall
   inside the variation of present-day humans. However, the overall
   divergence is greater for the three Neandertal genomes. For example,
   their modes are around divergences of ~11%, whereas for the San the
   mode is ~9% and for the other present-day humans ~8%. For the
   Neandertals, 13% of windows have a divergence above 20%, whereas this
   is the case for 2.5% to 3.7% of windows in the current humans.

   Fig. 3

   Divergence of Neandertal and human genomes. Distributions of divergence
   from the human genome reference sequence among segments of 100 kb are
   shown for three Neandertals and the five present-day humans.

   Furthermore, whereas in the French, Han, and Papuan individuals, 9.8%,
   7.8%, and 5.9% of windows, respectively, show between 0% and 2%
   divergence to the human reference genome, in the San and the Yoruba
   this is the case for 1.7% and 3.7%, respectively. For the three
   Neandertals, 2.2 to 2.5% of windows show 0% to 2% divergence to the
   reference genome.

   A catalog of features unique to the human genome. The Neandertal genome
   sequences allow us to identify features unique to present-day humans
   relative to other, now extinct, hominins. Of special interest are
   features that may have functional consequences. We thus identified,
   from whole genome alignments, sites where the human genome reference
   sequence does not match chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus macaque.
   These are likely to have changed on the human lineage since the common
   ancestor with chimpanzee. Where Neandertal fragments overlapped, we
   constructed consensus sequences and joined them into “minicontigs,”
   which were used to determine the Neandertal state at the positions that
   changed on the human lineage. To minimize alignment errors and
   substitutions, we disregarded all substitutions and insertions or
   deletions (indels) within 5 nucleotides of the ends of minicontigs or
   within 5 nucleotides of indels.

   Among 10,535,445 substitutions and 479,863 indels inferred to have
   occurred on the human lineage, we have information in the Neandertal
   genome for 3,202,190 and 69,029, i.e., 30% and 14%, respectively. The
   final catalog thus represents those sequenced positions where we have
   high confidence in their Neandertal state (SOM Text 11). As expected,
   the vast majority of those substitutions and indels (87.9% and 87.3%,
   respectively) occurred before the Neandertal divergence from modern
   humans.

   Features that occur in all present-day humans (i.e., have been fixed),
   although they were absent or variable in Neandertals, are of special
   interest. We found 78 nucleotide substitutions that change the
   protein-coding capacity of genes where modern humans are fixed for a
   derived state and where Neandertals carry the ancestral
   (chimpanzee-like) state (Table 2 and table S28). Thus, relatively few
   amino acid changes have become fixed in the last few hundred thousand
   years of human evolution; an observation consistent with a
   complementary study (57). We found only five genes with more than one
   fixed substitution changing the primary structure of the encoded
   proteins. One of these is SPAG17, which encodes a protein important for
   the axoneme, a structure responsible for the beating of the sperm
   flagellum (58). The second is PCD16, which encodes fibroblast
   cadherin-1, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that may be
   involved in wound healing (59). The third is TTF1, a transcription
   termination factor that regulates ribosomal gene transcription (60).
   The fourth is CAN15, which encodes a protein of unknown function. The
   fifth is RPTN, which encodes repetin, an extracellular epidermal matrix
   protein (61) that is expressed in the epidermis and at high levels in
   eccrine sweat glands, the inner sheaths of hair roots, and the filiform
   papilli of the tongue.
   Table 2

   Amino acid changes that are fixed in present-day humans but ancestral
   in Neandertals. The table is sorted by Grantham scores (GS). Based on
   the classification proposed by Li et al. in (87), 5 amino acid
   substitutions are radical (>150), 7 moderately radical (101 to 150), 33
   moderately conservative (51 to 100) and 32 conservative (1 to 50). One
   substitution creates a stop codon. Genes showing multiple substitutions
   have bold SwissProt identifiers. (Table S15 shows the human and
   chimpanzee genome coordinates, additional database identifiers, and the
   respective bases.) Genes with two fixed amino acids are indicated in
   bold.
   View this table:
     * View popup
     * View inline

   One of the substitutions in RPTN creates a stop codon that causes the
   human protein to contain 784 rather than 892 amino acids (SOM Text 11).
   We identified no fixed start codon differences, although the start
   codon in the gene TRPM1 that is present in Neandertals and chimpanzees
   has been lost in some present-day humans. TRPM1 encodes melastatin, an
   ion channel important for maintaining melanocyte pigmentation in the
   skin. It is intriguing that skin-expressed genes comprise three out of
   six genes that either carry multiple fixed substitutions changing amino
   acids or in which a start or stop codon has been lost or gained. This
   suggests that selection on skin morphology and physiology may have
   changed on the hominin lineage.

   We also identified a number of potential regulatory substitutions that
   are fixed in present-day humans but not Neandertals. Specifically, we
   find 42 substitutions and three indels in 5′-untranslated regions, and
   190 substitutions and 33 indels in 3′-untranslated regions that have
   become fixed in humans since they diverged from Neandertals. Of special
   interest are microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate gene
   expression by mRNA cleavage or repression of translation. We found one
   miRNA where humans carry a fixed substitution at a position that was
   ancestral in Neandertals (hsa-mir-1304) and one case of a fixed single
   nucleotide insertion where Neandertal is ancestral (AC109351.3). While
   the latter insertion is in a bulge in the inferred secondary structure
   of the miRNA that is unlikely to affect folding or putative targets,
   the substitution in mir-1304 occurs in the seed region, suggesting that
   it is likely to have altered target specificity in modern humans
   relative to Neandertals and other apes (fig. S16).

   Human accelerated regions (HARs) are defined as regions of the genome
   that are conserved throughout vertebrate evolution but that changed
   radically since humans and chimpanzees split from their common
   ancestor. We examined 2613 HARs (SOM Text 11) and obtained reliable
   Neandertal sequence for 3259 human-specific changes in HARs. The
   Neandertals carry the derived state at 91.4% of these, significantly
   more than for other human-specific substitutions and indels (87.9%).
   Thus, changes in the HARs tend to predate the split between Neandertals
   and modern humans. However, we also identified 51 positions in 45 HARs
   where Neandertals carry the ancestral version whereas all known
   present-day humans carry the derived version. These represent recent
   changes that may be particularly interesting to explore functionally.

   Neandertal segmental duplications. We analyzed Neandertal segmental
   duplications by measuring excess read-depth to identify and predict the
   copy number of duplicated sequences, defined as those with >95%
   sequence identity (62). A total of 94 Mb of segmental duplications were
   predicted in the Neandertal genome (table S33), which is in close
   agreement with what has been found in present-day humans (62) (fig.
   S18). We identified 111 potentially Neandertal-specific segmental
   duplications (average size 22,321 bp and total length 1862 kb) that did
   not overlap with human segmental duplications (fig. S20). Although
   direct experimental validation is not possible, we note that 81%
   (90/111) of these regions also showed excess sequence diversity (>3 SD
   beyond the mean) consistent with their being bona fide duplications
   (fig. S21). Many of these regions also show some evidence of increased
   copy number in humans, although they have not been previously
   classified as duplications (fig. S22). We identified only three
   putative Neandertal-specific duplications with no evidence of
   duplication among humans or any other primate (fig. S23), and none
   contained known genes.

   A comparison to any single present-day human genome reveals that 89% of
   the detected duplications are shared with Neandertals. This is lower
   than the proportion seen between present-day humans (around 95%) but
   higher than what is observed when the Neandertals are compared with the
   chimpanzee (67%) (fig. S19).

   Because the Neandertal data set is derived from a pool of three
   individuals and represents an average sequence coverage of 1.3-fold
   after filtering, we created two resampled sets from three human genomes
   (SOM Text 12) at a comparable level of mixture and coverage (table S34
   and figs. S24 and S25). The analysis of both resampled sets show a
   nonsignificant trend toward more duplicated sequences among Neandertals
   than among present-day humans (88,869 kb, N = 1129 regions for
   present-day humans versus 94,419 kb, N = 1194 for the Neandertals)
   (fig. S25).

   We also estimated the copy number for Neandertal genes and compared it
   with those from three previously analyzed human genomes (SOM Text 12).
   Copy number was correlated between the two groups (r^2 = 0.91) (fig.
   S29), with only 43 genes (15 nonredundant genes >10 kb) showing a
   difference of more than five copies (tables S35 and S36). Of these
   genes, 67% (29/43) are increased in Neandertals compared with
   present-day humans, and most of these are genes of unknown function.
   One of the most extreme examples is the gene PRR20 (NM_198441), for
   which we predicted 68 copies in Neandertals, 16 in humans, and 58 in
   the chimpanzee. It encodes a hypothetical proline-rich protein of
   unknown function. Other genes with predicted higher copy number in
   humans as opposed to Neandertals included NBPF14 (DUF1220), DUX4
   (NM_172239), REXO1L1 (NM_033178), and TBC1D3 (NM_001123391).

   A screen for positive selection in early modern humans. Neandertals
   fall within the variation of present-day humans for many regions of the
   genome; that is, Neandertals often share derived single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) alleles with present-day humans. We devised an
   approach to detect positive selection in early modern humans that takes
   advantage of this fact by looking for genomic regions where present-day
   humans share a common ancestor subsequent to their divergence from
   Neandertals, and Neandertals therefore lack derived alleles found in
   present-day humans (except in rare cases of parallel substitutions)
   (Fig. 4A). Gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans after their
   initial population separation might obscure some cases of positive
   selection by causing Neandertals and present-day humans to share
   derived alleles, but it will not cause false-positive signals.

   Fig. 4

   Selective sweep screen. (A) Schematic illustration of the rationale for
   the selective sweep screen. For many regions of the genome, the
   variation within current humans is old enough to include Neandertals
   (left). Thus, for SNPs in present-day humans, Neandertals often carry
   the derived allele (blue). However, in genomic regions where an
   advantageous mutation arises (right, red star) and sweeps to high
   frequency or fixation in present-day humans, Neandertals will be devoid
   of derived alleles. (B) Candidate regions of selective sweeps. All 4235
   regions of at least 25 kb where S (see SOM Text 13) falls below two
   standard deviations of the mean are plotted by their S and genetic
   width. Regions on the autosomes are shown in orange and those on the X
   chromosome in blue. The top 5% by S are shadowed in light blue. (C) The
   top candidate region from the selective sweep screen contains two
   genes, ZFP36L2 and THADA. The red line shows the log-ratio of the
   number of observed Neandertal-derived alleles versus the number of
   expected Neandertal-derived alleles, within a 100 kilobase window. The
   blue dots above the panel indicate all SNP positions, and the green
   dots indicate SNPs where the Neandertal carries the derived allele.

   We identified SNPs as positions that vary among the five present-day
   human genomes of diverse ancestry plus the human reference genome and
   used the chimpanzee genome to determine the ancestral state (SOM Text
   13). We ignored SNPs at CpG sites since these evolve rapidly and may
   thus be affected by parallel mutations. We identified 5,615,438 such
   SNPs, at about 10% of which Neandertals carry the derived allele. As
   expected, SNPs with higher frequencies of the derived allele in
   present-day humans were more likely to show the derived allele in
   Neandertals (fig. S31A). We took advantage of this fact to calculate
   (fig. S31C) the expected number of Neandertal-derived alleles within a
   given region of the human genome. The observed numbers of derived
   alleles were then compared with the expected numbers to identify
   regions where the Neandertal carries fewer derived alleles than
   expected relative to the human allelic states. A unique feature of this
   method is that it has more power to detect older selective sweeps where
   allele frequency spectra in present-day humans have recovered to the
   point that appreciable derived allele frequencies are observed, whereas
   it has relatively low power to detect recent selective sweeps where the
   derived alleles are at low frequencies in present-day humans. It is
   therefore particularly suited to detect positive selection that
   occurred early during the history of modern human ancestors in
   conjunction with, or shortly after, their population divergence from
   Neandertals (Fig. 4A).

   We identified a total of 212 regions containing putative selective
   sweeps (Fig. 4B and SOM Text 13). The region with the strongest
   statistical signal contained a stretch of 293 consecutive SNP positions
   in the first half of the gene AUTS2 where only ancestral alleles are
   observed in the Neandertals (fig. S34).

   We ranked the 212 regions with respect to their genetic width in
   centimorgans (Fig. 4B, and table S37) because the size of a region
   affected by a selective sweep will be larger the fewer generations it
   took for the sweep to reach fixation, as fewer recombination events
   will then have occurred during the sweep. Thus, the more intense the
   selection that drove a putative sweep, the larger the affected region
   is expected to be. Table 3 lists the 20 widest regions and the genes
   encoded in them. Five of the regions contain no protein-coding genes.
   These may thus contain structural or regulatory genomic features under
   positive selection during early human history. The remaining 15 regions
   contain between one and 12 genes. The widest region is located on
   chromosome 2 and contains the gene THADA, where a region of 336 kb is
   depleted of derived alleles in Neandertals. SNPs in the vicinity of
   THADA have been associated with type II diabetes, and THADA expression
   differs between individuals with diabetes and healthy controls (63).
   Changes in THADA may thus have affected aspects of energy metabolism in
   early modern humans. The largest deficit of derived alleles in
   Neandertal THADA is in a region where the Neandertals carry ancestral
   alleles at 186 consecutive human SNP positions (Fig. 4C). In this
   region, we identified a DNA sequence element of ~700 bp that is
   conserved from mouse to primates, whereas the human reference genome as
   well as the four humans for which data are available carry an insertion
   of 9 bp that is not seen in the Neandertals. We note, however, that
   this insertion is polymorphic in humans, as it is in dbSNP.

   Mutations in several genes in Table 3 have been associated with
   diseases affecting cognitive capacities. DYRK1A, which lies in the Down
   syndrome critical region, is thought to underlie some of the cognitive
   impairment associated with having three copies of chromsome 21 (64).
   Mutations in NRG3 have been associated with schizophrenia, a condition
   that has been suggested to affect human-specific cognitive traits (65,
   66). Mutations in CADPS2 have been implicated in autism (67), as have
   mutations in AUTS2 (68). Autism is a developmental disorder of brain
   function in which social interactions, communication, activity, and
   interest patterns are affected, as well as cognitive aspects crucial
   for human sociality and culture (69). It may thus be that multiple
   genes involved in cognitive development were positively selected during
   the early history of modern humans.

   One gene of interest may be RUNX2 (CBFA1). It is the only gene in the
   genome known to cause cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized
   by delayed closure of cranial sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic
   clavicles, a bell-shaped rib cage, and dental abnormalities (70). Some
   of these features affect morphological traits for which modern humans
   differ from Neandertals as well as other earlier hominins. For example,
   the cranial malformations seen in cleidocranial dysplasia include
   frontal bossing, i.e., a protruding frontal bone. A more prominent
   frontal bone is a feature that differs between modern humans and
   Neandertals as well as other archaic hominins. The clavicle, which is
   affected in cleidocranial dysplasia, differs in morphology between
   modern humans and Neandertals (71) and is associated with a different
   architecture of the shoulder joint. Finally, a bell-shaped rib cage is
   typical of Neandertals and other archaic hominins. A reasonable
   hypothesis is thus that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was of
   importance in the origin of modern humans and that this change affected
   aspects of the morphology of the upper body and cranium.

   Population divergence of Neandertals and modern humans. A long-standing
   question is when the ancestral populations of Neandertals and modern
   humans diverged. Population divergence, defined as the time point when
   two populations last exchanged genes, is more recent than the DNA
   sequence divergence because the latter is the sum of the time to
   population divergence plus the average time to the common ancestors of
   DNA sequences within the ancestral population. The divergence time of
   two populations can be inferred from the frequency with which derived
   alleles of SNPs discovered in one population are seen in the other
   population. The reason for this is that the older the population
   divergence, the more likely it is that derived alleles discovered in
   one population are due to novel mutations in that population. We
   compared transversion SNPs identified in a Yoruba individual (33) to
   other humans and used the chimpanzee and orangutan genomes to identify
   the ancestral alleles. We found that the proportion of derived alleles
   is 30.6% in the Yoruba, 29.8% in the Han Chinese, 29.7% in the French,
   29.3% in the Papuan, 26.3% in the San, and 18.0% in Neandertals. We
   used four models of Yoruba demographic history to translate derived
   allele fractions to population divergence (SOM Text 14). All provided
   similar estimates. Assuming that human-chimpanzee average DNA sequence
   divergence was 5.6 to 8.3 million years ago, this suggests that
   Neandertals and present-day human populations separated between 270,000
   and 440,000 years ago (SOM Text 14), a date that is compatible with
   some interpretations of the paleontological and archaeological record
   (2, 72).

   Neandertals are closer to non-Africans than to Africans. To test
   whether Neandertals are more closely related to some present-day humans
   than to others, we identified SNPs by comparing one randomly chosen
   sequence from each of two present-day humans and asking if the
   Neandertals match the alleles of the two individuals equally often. If
   gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans ceased before
   differentiation between present-day human populations began, this is
   expected to be the case no matter which present-day humans are
   compared. The prediction of this null hypothesis of no gene flow holds
   regardless of population expansions, bottlenecks, or substructure that
   might have occurred in modern human history (SOM Text 15). The reason
   for this is that when single chromosomes are analyzed in the two
   present-day populations, differences in demographic histories in the
   two populations will not affect the results even if they may profoundly
   influence allele frequencies. Under the alternative model of later gene
   flow between Neandertals and modern humans, we expect Neandertals to
   match alleles in individuals from some parts of the world more often
   than the others.

   We restricted this analysis to biallelic SNPs where two present-day
   humans carry different alleles and where the Neandertals carried the
   derived allele, i.e., not matching chimpanzee. We measured the
   difference in the percent matching by a statistic D(H[1], H[2],
   Neandertal, chimpanzee) (SOM Text 15) that does not differ
   significantly from zero when the derived alleles in the Neandertal
   match alleles in the two humans equally often. If D is positive,
   Neandertal alleles match alleles in the second human (H[2]) more often,
   while if D is negative, Neandertal alleles match alleles in the first
   human (H[1]) more often. We performed this test using eight present-day
   humans: two European Americans (CEU), two East Asians (ASN), and four
   West Africans (YRI), for whom sequences have been generated with Sanger
   technology, with reads of ~750 bp that we mapped along with the
   Neandertal reads to the chimpanzee genome. We find that the Neandertals
   are equally close to Europeans and East Asians: D(ASN, CEU, Neandertal,
   chimpanzee) = –0.53 ± 0.46% (<1.2 SD from 0% or P = 0.25). However, the
   Neandertals are significantly closer to non-Africans than to Africans:
   D(YRI, CEU, Neandertal, chimpanzee) = 4.57 ± 0.39% and D(YRI, ASN,
   Neandertal, chimpanzee) = 4.81 ± 0.39% (both >11 SD from 0% or P <<
   10^−12) (table S51).

   The greater genetic proximity of Neandertals to Europeans and Asians
   than to Africans is seen no matter how we subdivide the data: (i) by
   individual pairs of humans (Table 4), (ii) by chromosome, (iii) by
   substitutions that are transitions or transversions, (iv) by
   hypermutable CpG versus all other sites, (v) by Neandertal sequences
   shorter or longer than 50 bp, and (vi) by 454 or Illumina data. It is
   also seen when we restrict the analysis to A/T and C/G substitutions,
   showing that our observations are unlikely to be due to biased allele
   calling or biased gene conversion (SOM Text 15).

   A potential artifact that might explain these observations is
   contamination of the Neandertal sequences with non-African DNA.
   However, the magnitude of contamination necessary to explain the
   CEU-YRI and ASN-YRI comparisons are both over 10% and thus inconsistent
   with our estimates of contamination in the Neandertal data, which are
   all below 1% (Table 1). In addition to the low estimates of
   contamination, there are two reasons that contamination cannot explain
   our results. First, when we analyze the three Neandertal bones Vi33.16,
   Vi33.25, and Vi33.26 separately, we obtain consistent values of the D
   statistics, which is unlikely to arise under the hypothesis of
   contamination because each specimen was individually handled and was
   thus unlikely to have been affected by the same degree of contamination
   (SOM Text 15). Second, if European contamination explains the skews,
   the ratio D(H[1], H[2], Neandertal, chimpanzee)/D(H[1], H[2], European,
   chimpanzee) should provide a direct estimate of the contamination
   proportion α, because the ratio measures how close the Neandertal data
   are to what would be expected from entirely European contamination.
   However, when we estimate α for all three population pairs, we obtain
   statistically inconsistent results: α = 13.9 ± 1.1% for H[1]-H[2] =
   CEU-YRI, α = 18.9 ± 1.9% for ASN-YRI, and α = –3.9 ± 5.1% for CEU-ASN.
   This indicates that the skews cannot be explained by a unifying
   hypothesis of European contamination.
   Table 4

   Neandertals are more closely related to present-day non-Africans than
   to Africans. For each pair of modern humans H[1] and H[2] that we
   examined, we reported D (H[1], H[2], Neandertal, Chimpanzee): the
   difference in the percentage matching of Neandertal to two humans at
   sites where Neandertal does not match chimpanzee, with ±1 standard
   error. Values that deviate significantly from 0% after correcting for
   38 hypotheses tested are highlighted in bold (|Z| > 2.8 SD). Neandertal
   is skewed toward matching non-Africans more than Africans for all
   pairwise comparisons. Comparisons within Africans or within
   non-Africans are all consistent with 0%.

   To analyze the relationship of the Neandertals to a more diverse set of
   modern humans, we repeated the analysis above using the genome
   sequences of the French, Han, Papuan, Yoruba, and San individuals that
   we generated (SOM Text 9). Strikingly, no comparison within Eurasia
   (Papuan-French-Han) or within Africa (Yoruba-San) shows significant
   skews in D (|Z| < 2 SD). However, all comparisons of non-Africans and
   Africans show that the Neandertal is closer to the non-African (D from
   3.8% to 5.3%, |Z| > 7.0 SD) (Table 4). Thus, analyses of present-day
   humans consistently show that Neandertals share significantly more
   derived alleles with non-Africans than with Africans, whereas they
   share equal amounts of derived alleles when compared either to
   individuals within Eurasia or to individuals within Africa.

   Direction of gene flow. A parsimonious explanation for these
   observations is that Neandertals exchanged genes with the ancestors of
   non-Africans. To determine the direction of gene flow consistent with
   the data, we took advantage of the fact that non-Africans are more
   distantly related to San than to Yoruba (73–75) (Table 4). This is
   reflected in the fact that D(P, San, Q, chimpanzee) is 1.47 to 1.68
   times greater than D(P, Yoruba, Q, chimpanzee), where P and Q are
   non-Africans (SOM Text 15). Under the hypothesis of modern human to
   Neandertal gene flow, D(P, San, Neandertal, chimpanzee) should be
   greater than D(P, Yoruba, Neandertal, chimpanzee) by the same amount,
   because the deviation of the D statistics is due to Neandertals
   inheriting a proportion of ancestry from a non-African-like population
   Q. Empirically, however, the ratio is significantly smaller (1.00 to
   1.03, P << 0.0002) (SOM Text 15). Thus, all or almost all of the gene
   flow detected was from Neandertals into modern humans.

   Segments of Neandertal ancestry in non-African genomes. If
   Neandertal-to-modern human gene flow occurred, we predict that we
   should find DNA segments with an unusually low divergence to Neandertal
   in present-day humans. Furthermore, we expect that such segments will
   tend to have an unusually high divergence to other present-day humans
   because they come from Neandertals. In the absence of gene flow,
   segments with low divergence to Neandertals are expected to arise due
   to other effects, for example, a low mutation rate in a genomic segment
   since the split from the chimpanzee lineage. However, this will cause
   present-day humans to tend to have low divergence from each other in
   such segments, i.e., the opposite effect from gene flow. The
   qualitative distinction between these predictions allows us to detect a
   signal of gene flow. To search for segments with relatively few
   differences between Neandertals and present-day humans, we used haploid
   human DNA sequences, because in a diploid individual, both alleles
   would have to be derived from Neandertals to produce a strong signal.
   To obtain haploid human sequences, we took advantage of the fact that
   the human genome reference sequence is composed of a tiling path of
   bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which each represent single
   human haplotypes over scales of 50 to 150 kb, and we focused on BACs
   from RPCI11, the individual that contributed about two-thirds of the
   reference sequence and that has been previously shown to be of about
   50% European and 50% African ancestry (SOM Text 16) (76). We then
   estimated the Neandertal to present-day human divergence and found that
   in the extreme tail of low-divergence BACs there was a greater
   proportion of European segments than African segments, consistent with
   the notion that some genomic segments (SOM Text 16) were exchanged
   between Neandertals and non-Africans.

   To determine whether these segments are unusual in their divergence to
   other present-day humans, we examined the divergence of each segment to
   the genome of Craig Venter (77). We find that present-day African
   segments with the lowest divergence to Neandertals have a divergence to
   Venter that is 35% of the genome-wide average and that their divergence
   to Venter increases monotonically with divergence to Neandertals, as
   would be expected if these segments were similar in Neandertals and
   present-day humans due to, for example, a low mutation rate in these
   segments (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the European segments with the lowest
   divergence to Neandertals have a divergence to Venter that is 140% of
   the genome-wide average, which drops precipitously with increasing
   divergence to humans before rising again (Fig. 5A). This nonmonotonic
   behavior is significant at P < 10^−9 and is unexpected in the absence
   of gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans. The
   reason for this is that other causes for a low divergence to
   Neandertals, such as low mutation rates, contamination by modern
   non-African DNA, or gene flow into Neandertals, would produce monotonic
   behaviors. Among the segments with low divergence to Neandertals and
   high divergence to Venter, 94% of segments are of European ancestry
   (Fig. 5B), suggesting that segments of likely Neandertal ancestry in
   present-day humans can be identified with relatively high confidence.

   Fig. 5

   Segments of Neandertal ancestry in the human reference genome. We
   examined 2825 segments in the human reference genome that are of
   African ancestry and 2797 that are of European ancestry. (A) European
   segments, with few differences from the Neandertals, tend to have many
   differences from other present-day humans, whereas African segments do
   not, as expected if the former are derived from Neandertals. (B)
   Scatter plot of the segments in (A) with respect to their divergence to
   the Neandertals and to Venter. In the top left quandrant, 94% of
   segments are of European ancestry, suggesting that many of them are due
   to gene flow from Neandertals.

   Non-Africans haplotypes match Neandertals unexpectedly often. An
   alternative approach to detect gene flow from Neandertals into modern
   humans is to focus on patterns of variation in present-day
   humans—blinded to information from the Neandertal genome—in order to
   identify regions that are the strongest candidates for being derived
   from Neandertals. If these candidate regions match the Neandertals at a
   higher rate than is expected by chance, this provides additional
   evidence for gene flow from Neandertals into modern humans.

   We thus identified regions in which there is considerably more
   diversity outside Africa than inside Africa, as might be expected in
   regions that have experienced gene flow from Neandertals to
   non-Africans. We used 1,263,750 Perlegen Class A SNPs, identified in
   individuals of diverse ancestry (78), and found 13 candidate regions of
   Neandertal ancestry (SOM Text 17). A prediction of Neandertal-to-modern
   human gene flow is that DNA sequences that entered the human gene pool
   from Neandertals will tend to match Neandertal more often than their
   frequency in the present-day human population. To test this prediction,
   we identified 166 “tag SNPs” that separate 12 of the haplotype clades
   in non-Africans (OOA) from the cosmopolitan haplotype clades shared
   between Africans and non-Africans (COS) and for which we had data from
   the Neandertals. Overall, the Neandertals match the deep clade unique
   to non- Africans at 133 of the 166 tag SNPs, and 10 of the 12 regions
   where tag SNPs occur show an excess of OOA over COS sites. Given that
   the OOA alleles occur at a frequency of much less than 50% in
   non-Africans (average of 13%, and all less than 30%) (Table 5), the
   fact that the candidate regions match the Neandertals in 10 of 12 cases
   (P = 0.019) suggests that they largely derive from Neandertals. The
   proportion of matches is also larger than can be explained by
   contamination, even if all Neandertal data were composed of present-day
   non-African DNA (P = 0.0025) (SOM Text 17).
   Table 5

   Non-African haplotypes match Neandertal at an unexpected rate. We
   identified 13 candidate gene flow regions by using 48 CEU+ASN to
   represent the OOA population, and 23 African Americans to represent the
   AFR population. We identified tag SNPs for each region that separate an
   out-of-Africa specific clade (OOA) from a cosmopolitan clade (COS) and
   then assessed the rate at which Neandertal matches each of these clades
   by further subdividing tag SNPs based on their ancestral and derived
   status in Neandertal and whether they match the OOA-specific clade or
   not. Thus, the categories are AN (Ancestral Nonmatch), DN (Derived
   Nonmatch), DM (Derived Match), and AM (Ancestral Match). We do not list
   the sites where matching is ambiguous.

   This analysis shows that some old haplotypes most likely owe their
   presence in present-day non-Africans to gene flow from Neandertals.
   However, not all old haplotypes in non-Africans may have such an
   origin. For example, it has been suggested that the H2 haplotype on
   chromosome 17 and the D haplotype of the microcephalin gene were
   contributed by Neandertals to present-day non-Africans (12, 79, 80).
   This is not supported by the current data because the Neandertals
   analyzed do not carry these haplotypes.

   The extent of Neandertal ancestry. To estimate the proportion of
   Neandertal ancestry, we compare the similarity of non-Africans to
   Neandertals with the similarity of two Neandertals, N1 and N2, to each
   other. Under the assumption that there was no gene flow from
   Neandertals to the ancestors of modern Africans, the proportion of
   Neandertal ancestry of non-Africans, f, can be estimated by the ratio
   S(OOA,AFR,N1,Chimpanzee)/S(N2,AFR,N1,Chimpanzee), where the S statistic
   is an unnormalized version of the D statistic (SOM Text 18, Eq. S18.4).
   Using Neandertals from Vindija, as well as Mezmaiskaya, we estimate f
   to be between 1.3% and 2.7% (SOM Text 18). To obtain an independent
   estimate of f, we fit a population genetic model to the D statistics in
   Table 4 and SOM Text 15 as well as to other summary statistics of the
   data. Assuming that gene flow from Neandertals occurred between 50,000
   and 80,000 years ago, this method estimates f to be between 1 and 4%,
   consistent with the above estimate (SOM Text 19). We note that a
   previous study found a pattern of genetic variation in present-day
   humans that was hypothesized to be due to gene flow from Neandertals or
   other archaic hominins into modern humans (81). The authors of this
   study estimated the fraction of non-African genomes affected by
   “archaic” gene flow to be 14%, almost an order of magnitude greater
   than our estimates, suggesting that their observations may not be
   entirely explained by gene flow from Neandertals.

   Implications for modern human origins. One model for modern human
   origins suggests that all present-day humans trace all their ancestry
   back to a small African population that expanded and replaced archaic
   forms of humans without admixture. Our analysis of the Neandertal
   genome may not be compatible with this view because Neandertals are on
   average closer to individuals in Eurasia than to individuals in Africa.
   Furthermore, individuals in Eurasia today carry regions in their genome
   that are closely related to those in Neandertals and distant from other
   present-day humans. The data suggest that between 1 and 4% of the
   genomes of people in Eurasia are derived from Neandertals. Thus, while
   the Neandertal genome presents a challenge to the simplest version of
   an “out-of-Africa” model for modern human origins, it continues to
   support the view that the vast majority of genetic variants that exist
   at appreciable frequencies outside Africa came from Africa with the
   spread of anatomically modern humans.

   A striking observation is that Neandertals are as closely related to a
   Chinese and Papuan individual as to a French individual, even though
   morphologically recognizable Neandertals exist only in the fossil
   record of Europe and western Asia. Thus, the gene flow between
   Neandertals and modern humans that we detect most likely occurred
   before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papuans. This may
   be explained by mixing of early modern humans ancestral to present-day
   non-Africans with Neandertals in the Middle East before their expansion
   into Eurasia. Such a scenario is compatible with the archaeological
   record, which shows that modern humans appeared in the Middle East
   before 100,000 years ago whereas the Neandertals existed in the same
   region after this time, probably until 50,000 years ago (82).

   It is important to note that although we detect a signal compatible
   with gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of present-day humans
   outside Africa, this does not show that other forms of gene flow did
   not occur (Fig. 6). For example, we detect gene flow from Neandertals
   into modern humans but no reciprocal gene flow from modern humans into
   Neandertals. Although gene flow between different populations need not
   be bidirectional, it has been shown that when a colonizing population
   (such as anatomically modern humans) encounters a resident population
   (such as Neandertals), even a small number of breeding events along the
   wave front of expansion into new territory can result in substantial
   introduction of genes into the colonizing population as introduced
   alleles can “surf” to high frequency as the population expands. As a
   consequence, detectable gene flow is predicted to almost always be from
   the resident population into the colonizing population, even if gene
   flow also occurred in the other direction (83). Another prediction of
   such a surfing model is that even a very small number of events of
   interbreeding can result in appreciable allele frequencies of
   Neandertal alleles in the present-day populations. Thus, the actual
   amount of interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans may have
   been very limited, given that it contributed only 1 to 4% of the genome
   of present-day non-Africans.

   Fig. 6

   Four possible scenarios of genetic mixture involving Neandertals.
   Scenario 1 represents gene flow into Neandertal from other archaic
   hominins, here collectively referred to as Homo erectus. This would
   manifest itself as segments of the Neandertal genome with unexpectedly
   high divergence from present-day humans. Scenario 2 represents gene
   flow between late Neandertals and early modern humans in Europe and/or
   western Asia. We see no evidence of this because Neandertals are
   equally distantly related to all non-Africans. However, such gene flow
   may have taken place without leaving traces in the present-day gene
   pool. Scenario 3 represents gene flow between Neandertals and the
   ancestors of all non-Africans. This is the most parsimonious
   explanation of our observation. Although we detect gene flow only from
   Neandertals into modern humans, gene flow in the reverse direction may
   also have occurred. Scenario 4 represents old substructure in Africa
   that persisted from the origin of Neandertals until the ancestors of
   non-Africans left Africa. This scenario is also compatible with the
   current data.

   It may seem surprising that we see no evidence for greater gene flow
   from Neandertals to present-day Europeans than to present-day people in
   eastern Asia given that the morphology of some hominin fossils in
   Europe has been interpreted as evidence for gene flow from Neandertals
   into early modern humans late in Neandertal history [e.g., (84)] (Fig.
   6). It is possible that later migrations into Europe, for example in
   connection with the spread of agriculture, have obscured the traces of
   such gene flow. This possibility can be addressed by the determination
   of genome sequences from preagricultural early modern humans in Europe
   (85). It is also possible that if the expansion of modern humans
   occurred differently in Europe than in the Middle East, for example by
   already large populations interacting with Neandertals, then there may
   be little or no trace of any gene flow in present-day Europeans even if
   interbreeding occurred. Thus, the contingencies of demographic history
   may cause some events of past interbreeding to leave traces in
   present-day populations, whereas other events will leave little or no
   traces. Obviously, gene flow that left little or no traces in the
   present-day gene pool is of little or no consequence from a genetic
   perspective, although it may be of interest from a historical
   perspective.

   Although gene flow from Neandertals into modern humans when they first
   left sub-Saharan Africa seems to be the most parsimonious model
   compatible with the current data, other scenarios are also possible.
   For example, we cannot currently rule out a scenario in which the
   ancestral population of present-day non-Africans was more closely
   related to Neandertals than the ancestral population of present-day
   Africans due to ancient substructure within Africa (Fig. 6). If after
   the divergence of Neandertals there was incomplete genetic
   homogenization between what were to become the ancestors of
   non-Africans and Africans, present-day non-Africans would be more
   closely related to Neandertals than are Africans. In fact, old
   population substructure in Africa has been suggested based on genetic
   (81) as well as paleontological data (86).

   In conclusion, we show that genome sequences from an extinct late
   Pleistocene hominin can be reliably recovered. The analysis of the
   Neandertal genome shows that they are likely to have had a role in the
   genetic ancestry of present-day humans outside of Africa, although this
   role was relatively minor given that only a few percent of the genomes
   of present-day people outside Africa are derived from Neandertals. Our
   results also point to a number of genomic regions and genes as
   candidates for positive selection early in modern human history, for
   example, those involved in cognitive abilities and cranial morphology.
   We expect that further analyses of the Neandertal genome as well as the
   genomes of other archaic hominins will generate additional hypotheses
   and provide further insights into the origins and early history of
   present-day humans.

Classic Maya civilization in detail

   Lidar (a type of airborne laser scanning) provides a powerful technique
   for three-dimensional mapping of topographic features. It is proving to
   be a valuable tool in archaeology, particularly where the remains of
   structures may be hidden beneath forest canopies. Canuto et al. present
   lidar data covering more than 2000 square kilometers of lowland
   Guatemala, which encompasses ancient settlements of the Classic Maya
   civilization (see the Perspective by Ford and Horn). The data yielded
   population estimates, measures of agricultural intensification, and
   evidence of investment in landscape-transforming infrastructure. The
   findings indicate that this Lowland Maya society was a regionally
   interconnected network of densely populated and defended cities, which
   were sustained by an array of agricultural practices that optimized
   land productivity and the interactions between rural and urban
   communities.

Structured Abstract

INTRODUCTION

   Lowland Maya civilization flourished from 1000 BCE to 1500 CE in and
   around the Yucatan Peninsula. Known for its sophistication in writing,
   art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, this civilization is
   still obscured by inaccessible forest, and many questions remain about
   its makeup. In 2016, the Pacunam Lidar Initiative (PLI) undertook the
   largest lidar survey to date of the Maya region, mapping 2144 km^2 of
   the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. The PLI data have made it
   possible to characterize ancient settlement and infrastructure over an
   extensive, varied, and representative swath of the central Maya
   Lowlands.

RATIONALE

   Scholars first applied modern lidar technology to the lowland Maya area
   in 2009, focusing analysis on the immediate surroundings of individual
   sites. The PLI covers twice the area of any previous survey and
   involves a consortium of scholars conducting collaborative and
   complementary analyses of the entire survey region. This cooperation
   among scholars has provided a unique regional perspective revealing
   substantial ancient population as well as complex previously
   unrecognized landscape modifications at a grand scale throughout the
   central lowlands in the Yucatan peninsula.

RESULTS

   Analysis identified 61,480 ancient structures in the survey region,
   resulting in a density of 29 structures/km^2. Controlling for a number
   of complex variables, we estimate an average density of ~80 to 120
   persons/km^2 at the height of the Late Classic period (650 to 800 CE).
   Extrapolation of this settlement density to the entire 95,000 km^2 of
   the central lowlands produces a population range of 7 million to 11
   million. Settlement distribution is not homogeneous, however; we found
   evidence of (i) rural areas with low overall density, (ii) periurban
   zones with small urban centers and dispersed populations, and (iii)
   urban zones where a single, large city integrated a wider population.

   The PLI survey revealed a landscape heavily modified for intensive
   agriculture, necessary to sustain populations on this scale. Lidar
   shows field systems in the low-lying wetlands and terraces in the
   upland areas. The scale of wetland systems and their association with
   dense populations suggest centralized planning, whereas upland terraces
   cluster around residences, implying local management. Analysis
   identified 362 km^2 of deliberately modified agricultural terrain and
   another 952 km^2 of unmodified uplands for potential swidden use.
   Approximately 106 km of causeways within and between sites constitute
   evidence of inter- and intracommunity connectivity. In contrast,
   sizable defensive features point to societal disconnection and
   large-scale conflict.

CONCLUSION

   The 2144 km^2 of lidar data acquired by the PLI alter interpretations
   of the ancient Maya at a regional scale. An ancient population in the
   millions was unevenly distributed across the central lowlands, with
   varying degrees of urbanization. Agricultural systems found in lidar
   indicate how these populations were supported, although an irregular
   distribution suggests the existence of a regional agricultural economy
   of great complexity. Substantial infrastructural investment in
   integrative features (causeways) and conflictive features (defensive
   systems) highlights the interconnectivity of the ancient lowland Maya
   landscape. These perspectives on the ancient Maya generate new
   questions, refine targets for fieldwork, elicit regional study across
   continuous landscapes, and advance Maya archaeology into a bold era of
   research and exploration.

Abstract

   Lowland Maya civilization flourished in the tropical region of the
   Yucatan peninsula and environs for more than 2500 years (~1000 BCE to
   1500 CE). Known for its sophistication in writing, art, architecture,
   astronomy, and mathematics, Maya civilization still poses questions
   about the nature of its cities and surrounding populations because of
   its location in an inaccessible forest. In 2016, an aerial lidar survey
   across 2144 square kilometers of northern Guatemala mapped natural
   terrain and archaeological features over several distinct areas. We
   present results from these data, revealing interconnected urban
   settlement and landscapes with extensive infrastructural development.
   Studied through a joint international effort of interdisciplinary teams
   sharing protocols, this lidar survey compels a reevaluation of Maya
   demography, agriculture, and political economy and suggests future
   avenues of field research.

   Lowland Maya civilization flourished for nearly 2500 years (1000 BCE to
   1500 CE) in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize (Fig. 1), the
   central part of which consists of approximately 95,000 km^2 of rolling
   karst topography interspersed with wetlands (1). Today, this area is
   largely covered by tropical forest that has severely limited the scale
   of on-the-ground archaeological research, hindering regional
   assessments about ancient urbanism, population size, resource
   management, and sociopolitical complexity.

   Lowlands area as well as to the sites mentioned in text; for those
   survey blocks without a named site, the name of the block is provided
   (i.e., Env 1, Env 2, and Yala).

   In 2016, the Pacunam Lidar Initiative (PLI) undertook the largest lidar
   survey to date of the lowland Maya region, mapping a total of 2144 km^2
   of the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) in Petén, Guatemala. This survey
   mapped 10 noncontiguous areas (polygons) ranging in size from 91 to 454
   km^2, making it possible to characterize ancient settlement,
   agriculture, and physical infrastructure over an extensive and varied
   swath of the central Maya Lowlands by using a standardized and
   consistent dataset. Previous lidar surveys had taken place in Belize,
   Guatemala, and Mexico (2–8), providing important data on ancient
   lowland Maya civilization. However, the PLI sample, undertaken at far
   larger scale, captured greater variety in topography and ancient
   settlement for the central Maya Lowlands, the demographic and political
   heartland (9) of the Classic Maya culture. These data provide an
   opportunity to address current debates in Maya archaeology and to
   deepen studies of complex, tropical civilizations in the ancient world.

   Some scholars suggest that the Maya Lowlands contained small city-state
   centers ruled by warring elites (10–13), in settlements supported by a
   relatively sparse rural population practicing swidden farming (14),
   with only limited input from intensive agriculture (15–21). In
   contrast, other views point to a regional network of densely populated
   cities with complex integrative mechanisms (22–25) that depended on
   heavy labor investments inside and outside urban cores (15, 26, 27).
   Even though the latter view has been ascendant in recent years, the
   absence of regional data has left the debate unresolved. The PLI data
   cover a sufficiently large area to provide robust support for the
   latter model and offer further insights about human-environment
   interactions in the region, including unexpectedly extensive
   fortifications and road networks.

Data collection, processing, and field validation

   Lidar is an active remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to
   map landcover and ground surface in three-dimensional space. The PLI
   effort collected lidar data with a Teledyne Optech Titan MultiWave
   multichannel, multispectral, narrow–pulse width lidar system, the most
   advanced aerial lidar system (28) deployed in the region to date (Table
   1). The improvements include scanning of the terrain from six different
   view angles (versus the more usual two views) and higher sensor-range
   resolution, enabling more precise mapping of topographic signatures
   under short vegetation. The data collection was designed with a nominal
   laser density of 15 pulses/m^2 from a flying altitude of 650 m above
   ground level. The fidelity of this sensor reveals details of local
   topography, ancient architectural and agricultural features, and damage
   from looting (Fig. 2).

   openness visualization. (B) Looting features as drawn in the field
   (shown in red) as well as evidence of monumental architecture,
   causeways, residential structures, ditches, and terraces.

   The data were collected in 10 polygons over 12 designated survey blocks
   (Table 1). Each survey block was named for the largest known
   archaeological site within its boundaries; two survey blocks in
   archaeologically unknown areas were designated Env 1 and Env 2. The
   current dataset arose from roughly 33.5 billion laser pulses, producing
   about 60 billion returns, of which 5.2 billion were classified as
   ground returns. The average ground densities for different polygons
   range from 1.1 to 5.3 returns/m^2, the result of varying vegetation
   densities and canopy coverage across the survey area. Of the total
   mapped area, 23% has an average ground return density of 1.1
   returns/m^2, 60% has a ground return density range of 1.5 to 2.7
   returns/m^2, and 17% has an average ground return density of more than
   5.2 returns/m^2. These data were interpolated to create bare-earth
   terrain models with a spatial resolution of 1 m per grid cell.

   Identification of archaeological features within the lidar dataset was
   iterative (29). The PLI study region has been subject to thousands of
   person-days of pedestrian survey over the course of eight decades of
   field research. Consequently, there was an extensive “ground-truthed”
   dataset available for most survey blocks (Fig. 3). Analysts from each
   participating team made preliminary identifications using existing site
   maps as training samples. Features of archaeological interest were
   identified through visual inspection of lidar-derived terrain models.
   Multiple visualization rasters and manual identification were used to
   highlight distinct kinds of topographic features (Fig. 4); Table 2
   specifies the range of greatest utility in such visualizations. In
   addition to previously published methods (30–32), we developed a new
   technique, “prismatic openness” (33), that facilitated detection of
   small features such as simple house platforms and agricultural
   terraces.

   After preliminary identifications backed by preexisting map and
   excavation data, ground-truthing and test excavations occurred in 2017
   within the Holmul, Corona, Perú, Naachtun, Tintal, Uaxactun, and Zotz
   survey blocks. This allowed each project to (i) calibrate their feature
   identifications to ground conditions and (ii) identify patterns in
   false-positive and false-negative identifications. With this knowledge
   in hand, a second wave of feature identification took place from August
   to December 2017.

   Overall, approximately 165 km^2 within the study area have either been
   used as training samples, subsequently “ground-truthed,” or both (Table
   3); that is, 7.7% of the entire PLI survey region has been verified
   through ground survey, although mapped areas were not uniformly
   distributed (Table 3). Moreover, all field teams within the PLI study
   region have ground-validated features belonging to every class reported
   on here: buildings of various types, defensive features, upland and
   wetland agricultural features, causeways, canals, and reservoirs.

   PLI’s preliminary field validation efforts suggest that the feature
   identifications are accurate if slightly conservative. Most projects
   report a net increase in field-verified structures of ~15% over those
   identified through visual analysis of the lidar data. Furthermore,
   certain features—in particular, small channels or berms as well as
   large causeways—are clearly visible in the lidar although almost
   impossible to recognize on the ground without excavation, meaning that
   in-field visual inspection alone is not always capable of assessing the
   accuracy of lidar feature identifications. Nonetheless, because
   ground-truthing efforts are ongoing, and because error rates (false
   positives and negatives) are likely to vary for different classes of
   features, all analyses presented here use the 2017 PLI feature dataset
   with no further adjustments.

Population estimates

   Using the above methodology, 61,480 structures have been identified in
   the PLI survey region, resulting in an aggregate settlement density of
   29 structures/km^2 (Table 4). Because this structure count derives from
   a much-expanded and regionally representative dataset, it can serve as
   the basis for a uniquely robust regional population estimate. Even so,
   producing population estimates from archaeological data requires some
   assumptions of varying detail and scope from ethnographic analogy and
   archaeological data; as a consequence, the exercise comes with some
   degree of uncertainty that only future field research can reduce.

   blocks.

   To estimate Late Classic population from structure counts,
   well-established methodologies for the Maya Lowlands were adjusted by
   controlling for invisible structures, contemporaneity of use,
   nonresidential function, non–Late Classic occupation, and numbers of
   individuals per building (Table 5) (34). The values of these
   adjustments vary widely across the literature, given the regional
   variability of the archaeological record. The geographic scope of the
   PLI study area, which includes diverse landscapes with distinct
   settlement histories, necessitates a broader view beyond any single set
   of local adjustments. As such, values for each adjustment were collated
   from published scholarship and categorized into five sets according to
   their overall impact (minimum, low, middle, high, and maximum). All
   adjustments were then multiplied to derive a composite population index
   range (PopIndex), which, when multiplied by the total number of
   structures, produced an overall population range (29).
   Table 5 PopIndex calculations.

   Set of adjustments used to calculate a “population index” (PopIndex),
   which produces an estimated population when multiplied by structure
   number. The range in the value of each adjustment indicates the
   variation within the published record.

   Population estimates were calculated to the nearest half million to
   avoid false precision and are presented as a range rather than a single
   value for the central Maya Lowlands. Given the nature of the available
   excavation data, this study does not propose a diachronic demographic
   curve. It only estimates total population during the Late Classic
   population maximum, 650 to 800 CE, because all PLI survey blocks
   subjected to archaeological investigation have shown evidence for
   substantial Late Classic populations.

   Following this procedure and guidelines, we estimate a Late Classic
   population range of 150,000 to 240,000 for the entire PLI survey
   region. This number amounts to an average density of ~80 to 120
   persons/km^2. This density value accords with the ~100 persons/km^2
   suggested by previous nonlidar research (9, 34–37). Inomata et al.’s
   recently published lidar-derived settlement data from the Ceibal region
   (with 31 observed structures/km^2 across a sample of 470 km^2) (38) are
   consistent with the settlement data presented here.

   There is substantial variability in settlement density across the PLI
   survey blocks, which reflects a pattern characteristic of the entire
   central Maya Lowlands. That is, some areas will be densely settled
   (comparable to the Tikal, Xultun, or Naachtun survey blocks) and others
   will be sparsely occupied (comparable to the Corona, Yala, and Env 1
   and 2 survey blocks). However, because average settlement density over
   large areas is likely to be similar, the PLI dataset can be
   extrapolated with confidence over a 95,000-km^2 area known as the
   “central Maya Lowlands” (Fig. 1). This area excludes the northern
   Yucatan, the Gulf Coast plains, and coastal Belize and Quintana Roo
   because they differ physiogeographically from the PLI survey region.

   The Late Classic population for the central Maya Lowlands was
   calculated by multiplying (i) the mean structure density (structures
   per km^2) of the sample, (ii) the total area of the central Maya
   Lowlands (95,000 km^2), and (iii) the PopIndex range (see below):
   Embedded Image Embedded Image (1)This formula suggests that 61,480
   identified structures within 2144 km^2 of PLI’s surveyed area can be
   extrapolated to 2,724,396 structures over an area of 95,000 km^2. Once
   multiplied by the PopIndex range, these numbers yield a population
   range of 7 million to 11 million for the central Maya Lowlands during
   the Late Classic period. Notably, this range aligns with the upper end
   of prior estimates for the same region, derived from pedestrian surveys
   (36, 39–41). The incorporation of Inomata et al.’s published data from
   Ceibal (38) to both PLI’s structure and coverage area totals results in
   the same extrapolated population levels for the central Maya Lowlands—a
   good indication that the PLI dataset is a representative sample for the
   region and that the extrapolations are sound.

   This estimate is moderate, even conservative, primarily for two
   reasons: (i) The traditional method of calculating regional
   population—multiplying area (95,000 km^2) by a constant population
   density (80 to 120 persons/km^2)—has been found to underestimate the
   resident populations of larger centers (Tikal, Naachtun) that become
   denser with increasing scale (42). Accordingly, the densest urban areas
   likely would have contained more people than these current
   approximations. (ii) Although comparison of lidar-derived structure
   data and pedestrian survey data shows strong agreement within the PLI
   survey area, vegetation and taphonomic factors reduce the visibility of
   small structures in lidar-based visualizations. Ground validation of
   the PLI lidar-derived dataset has resulted in a ~15% net increase in
   archaeological structures. Because both of these factors would result
   in larger populations, only further fieldwork can render these
   estimates more accurate.

   Regardless of these caveats, the PLI data suggest overall regional
   populations of such scale that some degree of agricultural
   intensification (43–45) would have been required to sustain them.
   Approximately half of the central Lowlands are seasonal wetlands known
   as bajos (15). Because permanent settlements tended to avoid these
   flood-prone and poorly drained areas, they remained largely uninhabited
   and could then be available, after added investment, to intensive
   agriculture (46).

Agricultural intensification

   Early applications of airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) suggested
   the existence of wetland field systems throughout the entire central
   Maya Lowlands (47–49). However, most of the patterns identified as
   evidence of intensive agricultural features were later dismissed as
   “noise” in the imagery or artifacts of the local geology (15, 21,
   50–52). Furthermore, given that most of the wetlands in the interior of
   the peninsula contain clay vertisols, their overall suitability for
   ancient agriculture was challenged (17, 50, 52–57). Although aerial
   photography and fieldwork succeeded in identifying both upland and
   wetland intensive agricultural features in various zones within the
   lowlands (58–60), the extent of known agricultural improvements
   remained limited to a few specific areas (18–20, 55, 61–67).

   Even though the idea that lowland Maya society only relied on swidden
   was discarded in the 1980s in favor of a “new orthodoxy” claiming some
   reliance on a mosaic of more intensive agricultural strategies, the
   dominant view among specialists was that wetland agriculture was
   generally limited to areas peripheral to the central Maya Lowlands and
   that the elevated interior would have relied primarily on swidden
   agriculture (15, 18, 19, 27, 50, 52, 54, 61–63, 68, 69).

   The PLI survey revealed a landscape heavily modified for intensive
   agriculture: 11 of the 12 survey blocks include agricultural features
   of some kind. In wetland areas, the survey primarily identified
   drainage channels. These were designed either to draw water away from
   natural streams toward infrequently flooded areas or to drain those
   same areas during major floods. Their dimensions vary from 1 to 2 m in
   width and 20 to 50 cm in depth. Major channels can measure more than 1
   km in length (one extreme case at Tintal is 2.5 km long). Large and
   small channels intersected at regular intervals, forming nested grids
   within “channelized” fields (Fig. 5). Overall, these data suggest that
   wetlands throughout the central Maya Lowlands were modified for
   agricultural exploitation (16, 43, 61, 62, 70), rather than being used
   exclusively as sources of water and transportable soils (16, 71). The
   largest total area of wetland agriculture is found in the Naachtun
   region, with 31.5 km^2 of interspersed channelized zones, followed by
   Holmul and Tikal. The largest single zones of contiguous wetland fields
   occur in the Holmul survey block, ranging from 2.3 to 7 km^2, followed
   by Tikal and Naachtun. These wetlands may have been selected because of
   local edaphic conditions, yet they also lie near the most populated
   areas.

   Fig. 5 Wetland and upland agricultural features.

   Examples of intensive wetland fields featuring networks of canals
   (above) and upland field zones featuring low stone wall features and
   terraces.

   On upland terrain, numerous linear stone features such as terraces and
   low field walls were identified. These features measure 1 to 2 m in
   width and are no higher than 50 cm. Some are strictly linear (i.e.,
   contour terraces and check dams); others create enclosures (Fig. 5).
   Several features form gridded fields with or without enclosure walls,
   and, in some examples, surround residential structures similar to the
   albarradas (circular walls) of the northern Maya Lowlands (72). Because
   of their multiple functions, stone features vary widely in length, from
   only a few meters to >1 km.

   By identifying these features, we defined “zones of intensive
   cultivation” (29) where agricultural improvements were either the only
   feature in the landscape (e.g., wetland fields) or were interspersed
   with settlement. The latter case encompasses production systems
   generally described as infields, orchards, and houselot gardens. A
   total of 67 km^2 (6659 ha) of wetland fields and 295 km^2 (29,517 ha)
   of upland fields were classified as zones of intensive cultivation,
   accounting for ~17% (362 km^2) of the entire PLI survey area.
   Investments in upland agriculture are most common in the central and
   eastern sectors of our sample. The largest area totals occur, by
   descending order, in the Tikal (64 km^2), Uaxactun (57 km^2), Naachtun
   (47 km^2), and Xultun (45 km^2) survey blocks.

   Estimates for the overall productive capacity of this heavily modified
   agricultural landscape were calculated to determine whether it could
   have supported the Late Classic populations reported above. Little
   ethnographic information on the productivity of intensive agriculture
   in the Maya Lowlands is available, so estimations of overall productive
   capacity must rely on the productivity of swidden agriculture as the
   sole point of reference. Because some of the improved agricultural land
   was unusable (e.g., bajo) or prone to rapid degradation (e.g., erosible
   slopes), many improvements would have succeeded in extending
   productivity to otherwise unproductive areas (73). However, because
   some upland features were indeed placed on optimal land (i.e., gentle
   slopes) and the moisture-retaining properties of terraces improve
   agricultural productivity (37, 74), it is likely that some upland
   features did improve overall yields beyond what traditional swidden
   agriculture could produce. Nonetheless, these calculations assume that
   all zones of intensive cultivation resulted in the same productive
   capacity as swidden.

   Ethnographic data on the productivity of traditional lowland Maya
   swidden agriculture were collated and standardized to estimate the
   number of hectares necessary to support one person. Data on swidden
   productivity were drawn from Cowgill (75–77), Griffin (78), Schwartz
   (79, 80), Nations and Nigh (81), and Ford and Nigh (37).
   Standardization entailed, among other adjustments, normalizing the
   annual productivity of different fallow regimes to multiyear averages.
   These calculations resulted in a mean productivity value of 0.48 ha per
   person [the mean of the range (0.34 to 0.62 ha per person) resulting
   from using different adjustments from the above-cited sources] (table
   S3). This value was then applied to all the land in the PLI sample
   (1314 km^2) available for agricultural production (zones of intensive
   cultivation and nonwetland rural areas) to derive a maximum supportable
   population. Finally, by the same logic applied to population estimates,
   this number was adjusted to account for the possibility that these
   features of agricultural intensification were not all coeval. These
   calculations (Table 6) suggest that the total amount of land available
   for agricultural production in the PLI sample would have been more than
   sufficient to sustain the population levels reported above (29).
   Table 6 Maximum sustainable population of each survey block.

   Calculations designed to determine the maximum sustainable population
   within each survey block based on (i) its total measured agricultural
   area (values adjusted for Late Classic contemporaneity using AgroIndex)
   and (ii) a minimum swidden area of 0.48 ha/person (mean value of range
   reported in table S3).

   Consequently, the PLI data indicate some combination of the following
   possibilities: (i) There was capacity for surplus food production; (ii)
   substantial portions of agricultural land were dedicated to the
   production of nonfoodstuffs (such as cotton or cacao); (iii) large
   areas of the uplands remained covered in forest (37, 82, 83); or (iv)
   populations were higher than our current estimates. Agricultural
   intensification could also have been achieved using strategies such as
   fallow-period shortening, multicropping, and manipulation of crop
   sociology; these would not have occasioned changes to the landscape
   visible in lidar. In addition to corn, a variety of other edible plants
   and fruit trees are known to have been grown in and around improved
   upland fields (14). Therefore, this study’s reliance on both physical
   infrastructure (as an index for intensification) and ethnographic data
   of modern swidden productivity likely underestimates the total
   productive capacity of ancient lowland Maya agriculture.

   This dataset also demonstrates great variability in agricultural
   investment across the region (Fig. 6). The Corona survey block (432
   km^2) has <1% of its available land improved for cultivation, whereas
   the Tikal block (147 km^2) has as much as 70%. Indeed, the lowest
   densities of agricultural features occur in the less populated western
   blocks of the sample, and the highest densities are located in the
   central and eastern sectors where settlement is densest. Across the PLI
   sample, areas defined here as periurban and urban (see below) contained
   the greatest relative density of agricultural features. Urban cores
   contained no agricultural features, whereas rural areas contained
   relatively fewer improved fields (Table 7 and Fig. 6). The scale of
   wetland field systems and their close association with densely
   populated areas suggest some degree of centralized involvement.
   Conversely, agricultural modifications of the uplands cluster around
   residential groups, which suggests that they were likely managed by
   household or small corporate groups. Upland improvements and terracing
   are common, likely making a substantial contribution to overall
   regional production (26).

   The co-occurrence of dense settlement with agricultural improvements
   suggests that investments to maximize agricultural production were
   directed to areas where population sprawl limited the possibility for
   extensive farming. Despite these efforts, however, the estimated yield
   of the agricultural lands within the most heavily modified survey
   blocks—Tikal, Naachtun, Xultun, and Perú—would not have been sufficient
   to sustain their populations (Table 6). Even if the zones of intensive
   cultivation within these survey blocks had been twice as productive as
   swidden fields, none of these areas would have harvested enough to
   achieve self-sufficiency. That is, people living in these blocks were
   partly dependent on foodstuffs imported from surrounding areas. Such
   data point to a lowland Maya landscape that was a mosaic of
   interdependent densely populated political centers and extensive
   periurban hinterlands engaged in a complex set of interactions.

Urbanization

   Settlement studies at lowland Maya sites have often used categories
   such as “site core,” “periphery,” and “rural” to delimit zones of
   different settlement density (84–86). These are useful categories at
   local scales. However, the scope of the PLI dataset allowed for a
   comparison of settlement density at a regional level. A shared
   settlement density scale was developed by applying figures compiled by
   Rice and Culbert (35) (Table 8). Their data, based on ground survey of
   sites with variably defined limits, provided the justification for four
   classes; a fifth—“vacant”—was added for a total of five classes. In
   summary, five structure density categories—vacant, rural, periurban,
   urban, and urban core—were defined for the entire dataset (29) to
   discern differences not only in the size and density of cities but also
   in the relationship between cities and hinterlands (86–89).
   Table 8 Late Classic structure density classes, modified from Rice and
   Culbert (35).

   The “urban core” class was defined on the basis of structure densities
   at the heart of the largest Maya centers, such as Tikal (~700
   structures/km^2). “Urban” describes the structure density at the heart
   of many smaller cities within the PLI study area (e.g., Uaxactun, Zotz)
   as well as the densely settled surroundings of major cities’ urban
   cores (e.g., Xultun, Naachtun, and Tikal). “Periurban” zones (also
   known in the literature as “urban fringes”) combine characteristics of
   both urban and rural areas (90). The parameters of this category
   encompass those areas designated by prior surveys as “peripheral” to
   the largest Maya sites as well as sites often characterized as “minor
   centers” whose economic and political fortunes were closely articulated
   with larger cities nearby (91–93). Our “rural” class follows existing
   descriptions of settlement density in the hinterlands of smaller cities
   and minor centers. Finally, we classified as “vacant” all zones with
   fewer than 10 structures/km^2.

   At the regional level, sprawling urban and periurban settlement zones
   covered large areas in the east, whereas the west remained mostly rural
   (Fig. 7). Urban core densities ran as high as 1000 to 2000
   persons/km^2, whereas rural areas were as low as 50 persons/km^2 over
   continuous areas. However, the PLI sample also revealed striking
   regional differences in urbanization patterns (Table 9).

   Cluster analysis of the settlement patterns within the PLI sample
   revealed several intraregional patterns. Because the PLI survey blocks
   varied in shape and in total area, standardized 80-km^2 sample areas
   were designed for cluster analysis. These areas were delineated to
   maintain the primary urban center in as central a location as possible
   within the sample area. Because of the variable shape and dimensions of
   each PLI survey block, sample areas could not be drawn with identical
   proportions; nonetheless, areas were 80 km^2 in all cases, with
   proportions as standardized as possible. The Corona and Holmul survey
   blocks were large enough to delineate two distinct sample areas for
   each survey block. These two additional sample areas were named
   Achiotal and Xmakabatun (for the Corona and Holmul survey blocks,
   respectively) after the name of the primary center within each area.

   Cluster analysis of these 14 areas (Fig. 8) (29) indicates that
   settlement patterns at the regional level fall into three classes: (i)
   rural areas with low overall density and limited political integration
   (Env 1, Env 2, Yala, Corona, Achiotal); (ii) periurban areas containing
   small urban centers with large periurban and rural populations
   (Uaxactun, Holmul, Xmakabatun, and Zotz); and (iii) urban areas with
   periurban and rural populations surrounding and likely integrated with
   a single large urban center. Within this third class are two
   subclasses: moderately urbanized areas with more substantial periurban
   and rural populations (Tintal and Xultun), and highly urbanized areas
   in which most of the population lived in urban core, urban, and
   periurban zones (Naachtun and Tikal).

   Fig. 8 Cluster analysis of density patterns.

   Ward linkage method, squared Euclidean distance.

   Such variety cannot be explained by sole reference to topographic,
   pedological, or ecological conditions; political and economic forces,
   including conflict, likely exerted commensurate or stronger influence.
   Furthermore, nearly all the areas identified as urban were also those
   incapable of sustaining themselves agriculturally, whereas all the
   rural and periurban areas were capable of producing food surpluses to
   feed the rest of the sample’s population. These data suggest that
   lowland Maya settlement was characterized by both high variability and
   high interdependence along a rural-urban continuum rather than by a
   dispersed, homogeneous, low-density settlement (94).

   A word of caution is warranted about assuming contemporaneity of all
   structures in this classification. For instance, three survey
   blocks—Zotz, Uaxactun, and Holmul—hold substantial centers that were
   abandoned in the Late Preclassic period and only partly resettled in
   the Classic period. However, because these blocks already form a
   statistically distinct group, we are confident that they would remain
   clustered even after factoring out all earlier settlement in those
   three areas.

   A few other patterns bear mentioning. First, the city of El Perú-Waka’
   with a sustained density of 1100 structures/km^2 (95)—nearly double
   that of Tikal—exhibits a uniquely nucleated urban core that transitions
   rapidly to a rural hinterland. The singular urban morphology of El
   Perú-Waka’, although it generally fits the urban area pattern, might
   reflect distinct economic or political influences on its development
   and organization. Second, although the Corona block was essentially
   rural, it did include several small pockets of urban density. This
   region had a strategic role in the expansion of the hegemonic Kaanul
   polity during the sixth through eighth centuries CE (96–102), so
   settlement nucleation here was probably conditioned by regional
   geopolitics in addition to local demographic processes. Finally, the
   urban and periurban settlement zones of Tikal extend over at least 76
   km^2, representing one of the largest continuous settlement zones in
   the Maya Lowlands (26).

Engineering and infrastructure

   Lidar data also elucidate the extent of lowland Maya investment in
   water management, regional communication, and defense. The Maya
   constructed reservoirs that required considerable labor (103). At the
   household level, reservoirs, quarries, wells, and underground cisterns
   were commonly cut into bedrock to collect rainwater (104–110). Within
   urban centers, the ancient Maya deepened, dammed, or bermed natural
   depressions to capture rainwater running off stucco-paved surfaces
   (111). Lidar data now show a greater extent of such large features.
   Large, round, and bermed reservoirs were built within wetlands to serve
   the needs of the rural population, and drainage ditches were cut into
   the edges of reservoirs to control flow during the wettest periods.

   Lidar-derived terrain models allow for a volumetric assessment of
   reservoirs, in measures likely to be conservative because of later
   infilling. Here, we present data only on the built reservoirs of large
   scale (i.e., those serving more than a single household) (29). In our
   sample, Tikal’s urban core had the largest amount of water storage
   capacity in human-made reservoirs. The Tikal Palace Reservoir alone
   could store 31,000 m^3 of water, which would be sufficient to supply
   the inhabitants of the urban core for an entire year. Earlier cities
   such as Cival and Tintal were near natural depressions that provided
   generous amounts of water with little labor investment. For example,
   Tintal ringed a 2-km-wide sinkhole that could have contained more than
   3 million m^3 of water in wet years. A 2.5-km canal carried overflow
   into a natural drainage, preventing rising waters from flooding the
   city.

   In all cases, such features are monumental in scale and imply some form
   of centralized involvement in planning and execution. Notably,
   large-scale water infrastructure is not limited to city centers but
   occurs in the periurban and even rural zones surrounding major cities,
   and in some cases integrates cities and their peripheries. These
   findings indicate that the construction of monumental reservoirs and,
   less commonly, canals in both city centers and rural areas involved
   some form of centralized, institutional coordination. Yet this
   observation does not negate the possibility that smaller-scale
   infrastructure was independently built by households and corporate
   groups (104). Rather, the PLI data suggest that water management was
   neither fully centralized (112) nor left completely to individual
   households.

   Lidar data also reveal investment in regional and local
   interconnectivity. “Causeways,” elevated and paved roads of varied
   size, demonstrate economic and political integration by revealing
   formal connections between cities, smaller communities, and dispersed
   populations (113). Until recently, knowledge of formal political
   connections was restricted to epigraphic records of dynastic
   interaction and a small number of causeways (25, 26, 114–117). The
   lidar sample identified ~106 linear kilometers of causeway construction
   dating to the Late Preclassic and Classic periods. Intersite causeways
   are primarily associated with cities that rose to prominence during the
   Preclassic period (Tintal, Cival, San Bartolo) or Early Classic
   (Naachtun) and are surprisingly absent from the Late Classic period.
   They can reach up to 22 km in length (Tintal-Mirador) and 10 to 20 m in
   width, linking cities to smaller centers nearby. Examples of these
   occur at Tintal, where multiple monumental causeways radiate toward
   other centers. Intra-site causeways are associated with Late Classic
   period centers of all sizes. These roads are typically only a few
   hundred meters long, providing grand entryways to public spaces within
   a community. Tikal has the widest causeways (80 m) and the largest
   amount of internal paved causeway area (0.19 km^2). Overall, causeways
   are more widely distributed than had been previously appreciated,
   especially in the Late Classic period. Across the sample, there is a
   general trend of increased causeway density from west to east and from
   south to north (Fig. 9), coinciding with regional gradients in
   settlement density, agricultural intensification, and water management
   infrastructure.

   Perhaps the most obvious example of infrastructural investment comes in
   the form of defensive or military features pointing to a high incidence
   of conflict in the Maya Lowlands. Such fortifications are found at a
   scale and quantity (Fig. 10) matched only by the Tikal earthworks and
   the monumental fortifications at Becan, both known since the 1960s
   (118–120). To a notable extent, settlement density does not correlate
   with regional defense, in that some of the most densely settled blocks,
   such as Naachtun, have no defensive features. Individual defensive
   features—bridges, ditches, ramparts, stone walls, and terraces—were
   constructed as components of “built defensive systems.” These combined
   with natural defenses to protect “defended areas.” There were five
   types of built defensive systems: landscape ditch-and-rampart (type 1),
   hilltop ditch-and-rampart (type 2), contoured terrace (type 3),
   stand-alone rampart (type 4), and stone wall (type 5). These were
   unevenly distributed across the sample, reflecting variation in local
   geography, resources, and history.

   Fig. 10 Density of defensive features.

   Density is expressed as linear meters of defensive features per square
   kilometer normalized by survey block area.

   Built defensive systems are found in 36 discrete locations across the
   sample, with 31 meeting the criteria for defended areas (Table 10). In
   most cases (61.3%), defenses consisted of more than the establishment
   of perimeter walls. One-third (n = 10) of all defended areas displayed
   more defensive features within the perimeter than on the perimeter
   itself (Table 11). The Holmul and Zotz survey blocks exhibited the
   greatest effort in reinforcing defenses, suggesting a heavy investment
   in the protection of particular sites in those areas. We also
   identified “refuges,” highly defensible areas lacking any other
   perceptible architecture. Presumably, these were only used as a last
   resort and for brief stays. Clear examples appear at Kanalna and the El
   Achiotal promontory.

   Several metrics were calculated to interpret the defensive data (29).
   We assessed the “perceived need” for defense of an area according to
   the percentage of the perimeter defended by built or natural defenses
   (Table 10), as well as how much defensibility factored into the siting
   of a settlement. The latter statistic is a preparedness index that
   factors out the natural defensibility of a location (Table 12). At some
   larger sites, such as Tikal and Tintal, substantial investment in
   building perimeter defenses around the urban core suggests that the
   need for such constructions emerged well after the initial
   establishment of the settlement. Finally, we assessed the cost of
   building defensive systems in relation to the total protected area
   (Table 13). The defensive features of greatest cost are located in the
   southern part of the sample, particularly the Early Classic Buenavista
   Valley linking El Zotz and Tikal.

   At the regional level, the Zotz, Tikal, Holmul, and Perú blocks show
   the greatest concentration of defensive features (Table 14). However,
   both the Zotz and Tikal regions demonstrate the largest investment of
   built and combined defenses in the sample. By controlling for survey
   block size, a line density analysis (Fig. 10) highlights the higher
   investment in defense along a west-to-east route. The trend continues
   to the east with several fortified hilltops in the Holmul region. The
   greatest density of high-cost features extends along a corridor
   associated with a Central Mexican (Teotihuacan) military intrusion into
   the Maya Lowlands in the late fourth century CE (121).

Concluding remarks

   Since its first application in Maya archaeology (122), lidar technology
   has enabled the evaluation of lowland Maya society on a large scale.
   The PLI results confirm that lidar technology represents a watershed
   event in archaeological survey of forested environments. In the central
   Maya Lowlands, lidar survey will become indispensable for settlement
   research because of (i) the speed of the data-gathering process, (ii)
   the degree of detail attainable over large areas, and (iii) the ability
   to discern large and small features routinely undetected by traditional
   methods.

   The PLI lidar survey provides a uniquely large and continuous dataset
   for the central Maya Lowlands that is replete with evidence for ancient
   structures, canals, terraces, causeways, and defensive features. These
   data also show great variability in the intensity and distribution of
   these features over space. In sum, the PLI data unambiguously support
   the notion that the lowland Maya constructed a variable and contentious
   landscape in which a regionally interconnected network of densely
   populated and defended cities was sustained by an array of agricultural
   practices that optimized land productivity, resource diversity, and
   sustainability on a much grander scale than previously thought.

   These preliminary conclusions should encourage research that, among
   many possibilities, (i) quantifies labor investments and land
   productivity at every scale; (ii) addresses how projects of
   agricultural intensification were organized and managed, with
   implications for long-term sustainability; (iii) assesses the extent of
   economic interdependence within large regions by studying differences
   between urban and rural populations; (iv) determines the relationship
   among settlement densities, land use, and monumental infrastructure;
   and (v) develops models for the types of warfare implied by defensive
   features.

   Finally, by detecting most looters’ pits and assembling full
   inventories of ruins, lidar data offer a profound tool for cultural
   heritage management. Quantification of biomass and monitoring of
   biodiversity—an underexplored product of these lidar data—will also
   facilitate planning and management of regional conservation efforts and
   deepen our understanding of the relationship between ancient and modern
   environments.

Methods

   The Pacunam Lidar Initiative collected lidar data over an area of 2144
   km^2 of the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) in northern Guatemala. These
   data were provided to the research consortium as bare-earth terrain
   models with grid resolution of 1 m. Given the coverage scale and
   resolution, these raster models make it possible to interpret aspects
   of ancient Maya society as warranted by visible remains of
   archaeological settlement. These data were analyzed to (i) estimate
   regional population levels, (ii) calculate agricultural capacity, (iii)
   determine settlement density patterns, and (iv) evaluate the extent of
   infrastructural investment in water storage, regional communication,
   and defense.

   Terrain data and its derivatives were mostly manipulated and analyzed
   through GIS applications (ArcMap 10.4 and 10.6, QGIS 2.18, and GRASS
   7.2, and the Relief Visualization Toolkit 1.3), enhanced by
   supplemental calculations and statistical analyses performed in
   Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Terrain models were visualized using multiple
   methods. Archaeological features were digitized manually, using
   existing site maps as training samples, augmented by targeted
   ground-truthing during the 2017 field season. All PLI member projects
   uploaded their manually derived feature datasets to a shared cloud
   server, where they were collated to create a single regional dataset
   for each feature class (e.g., buildings, causeways, terraces, etc.).

   Population estimates are based on the total number of structures in the
   sample and include adjustments for Late Classic occupation,
   nonresidential structures, structures not visible on the surface,
   contemporaneity of occupation within the Late Classic period, and
   number of persons per structure. Settlement density classes were
   calculated using the Heatmap tool in QGIS 2.18 and classified according
   to published descriptions of settlement density in the cores and
   peripheries of numerous sites in the central Lowlands. Agricultural
   capacity was estimated by combining zones of intensive cultivation
   (defined on the basis of built agricultural features) with sparsely
   settled and unmodified uplands to define the total area available for
   agriculture; this area was then multiplied by a standardized estimate
   of traditional Maya swidden productivity. Water storage capacity was
   calculated using the r.lake function in GRASS 7.2. Causeways were
   classified using published typologies and statistics calculated by
   “calculate geometries” in ArcMap 10.4. Defensive features were
   classified by an original typology, their distribution was analyzed
   using the Line Density tool in ArcMap 10.6, and inferences regarding
   their cost effectiveness and other metrics were derived from
   statistical analyses performed in Microsoft Excel.

   See (29) for detailed methodology and analytical procedures for each of
   these analyses.

   because of planning, funding, and management by the Fundación
   Patrimonio Cultural y Natural Maya-PACUNAM. PLI’s technology provider
   for the collection and processing of the 2016 lidar dataset was the NSF
   National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM). Permissions for
   lidar collection and field work were granted to NCALM-Pacunam and
   participating archaeological projects by the Guatemalan Ministry of
   Culture and Sports of Guatemala. We thank three anonymous reviewers for
   their careful reading and helpful comments on earlier drafts of the
   manuscript. Funding: Supported by the Fundación Patrimonio Cultural y
   Natural Maya-PACUNAM through contributions from the Hitz Foundation and
