Huawei Consumer Electronics Chief Braces for ‘Tough Time’

   When President Donald Trump decided to block Huawei’s access to U.S.
   technology last week, the Chinese company already had been developing
   its own chips and stockpiling parts from American suppliers to prepare
   for the worst. That clearly wasn’t enough.

   Huawei was broadsided by Google’s decision over the weekend to restrict
   its access to Android, which powers all of the Chinese company’s
   smartphones, to comply with the U.S. sanctions. In an exclusive
   interview with The Information on Tuesday, Huawei consumer electronics
   chief Richard Yu said the company would be “forced to launch our own OS
   [operating system] and ecosystem.”

Frustrated Musk Shakes Up Autopilot Team

   Several key Tesla engineering managers working on its Autopilot
   semi-automated driving feature left the company after CEO Elon Musk
   told some employees he was unhappy with the progress in developing
   fully automated driving capabilities, according to one current and one
   former Tesla employee who have been involved in the effort. He is also
   upset that some team members have told him they can’t meet the
   timelines he has set for developing the technology, they said.

   At least 11 members of the software team, or close to 10% of the total
   group, including some longtime members, departed in the past few
   months, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation.
   Several of the remaining managers are now working directly with Mr.
   Musk. These departures follow Mr. Musk’s removal of the Autopilot
   group’s leader Stuart Bowers around the start of May, a move first
   reported by website Electrek, which also referenced some of the other
   exits. Mr. Musk also elevated other people within the Autopilot team as
   part of a broader shake-up.

   on Three Lessons From WeWork
   Secular trends often have single moment tipping points, and this will
   likely be that moment.  Large unicorns thinking of go public with no
   profitability are going to have to think long and hard about their
   public valuations rather than that of their last funding round.  They
   will also have to tell credible investment stories with real disclosure
   to the markets.  The era of unicorn S1 financial obfuscation
   using flighty mission statements in lieu of real financial disclosure
   is likely over.

   on Snap Courts Publishers for News Tab
   We dabbled in it when I was there with some success - Good Luck America
   & Peter Hamby did a great job of laying a foundation - but didn't
   invest in it enough to really become the de facto news hub for our
   users. I don't think you can tip toe into news as a platform, or simply
   create publishing tools and put it all on your partners to make it work
   & build audience - either you really double down on investing in it,
   creating models that work for publishers, and marketing it as well to
   break through the noise - or you just stay away from it altogether.

   on No ‘Go’ Soda Lines: Amazon’s Search for Ideal Cashierless Store
   Really pains me to see Amazon making small efforts to lower their
   footprint but maximizing those with PR and marketing, all the while not
   making the larger and harder efforts to do so in the name of driving
   the bottom line.  All with the intention of simply driving more and
   more consumption of stuff.

   Daniel S. Aegerter

   on Tech Companies Lead Convertible Debt Surge

   The reason the interest rate is lower is because the long term call
   option in the high vol stock has value, which gets crystallised by
   selling puts and receiving cash, this puts pressure on the stock. The
   impact of the resulting reflexivity is under appreciated by most
   issuers.

   In a downturn some years from now, if the stock is below the strike the
   company will likely have a harder time raising replacement debt and it
   will also be an inopportune time to raise equity.

   Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s claim on Tuesday that Facebook has “bulldozed
   competition” reflects a view that is driving an antitrust investigation
   into the social network giant. It’s a little ironic, then, that two of
