A Look Inside Our 210TB 2012 Web Corpus

   August 13, 2013Lisa Green

   Want to know more detail about what data is in the 2012 Common Crawl
   corpus without running a job? Now you can thanks to Sebastian Spiegler!

   Sebastian is a highly talented data scientist who works at the London
   based startup SwiftKey and volunteers at Common Crawl. He did an
   exploratory analysis of the 2012 Common Crawl data and produced an
   excellent summary paper on exactly what kind of data it contains:
   Statistics of the Common Crawl Corpus 2012.

   From the conclusion section of the paper:

   The 2012 Common Crawl corpus is an excellent opportunity for
   individuals or businesses to cost- effectively access a large portion
   of the internet: 210 terabytes of raw data corresponding to 3.83
   billion documents or 41.4 million distinct second- level domains.
   Twelve of the top-level domains have a representation of above 1%
   whereas documents from .com account to more than 55% of the corpus. The
   corpus contains a large amount of sites from youtube.com, blog
   publishing services like blogspot.com and wordpress.com as well as
   online shopping sites such as amazon.com. These sites are good sources
   for comments and reviews. Almost half of all web documents are utf-8
   encoded whereas the encoding of the 43% is unknown. The corpus contains
   92% HTML documents and 2.4% PDF files. The remainder are images, XML or
   code like JavaScript and cascading style sheets.

   View or download a pdf of Sebastian’s paper here. If you want to dive
   deeper you can find the non-aggregated data at
   s3://commoncrawl/index2012 and the code on GitHub.
