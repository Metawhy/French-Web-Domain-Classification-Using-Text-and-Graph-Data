The documentary by the students and teacher of “The Third Wave” (aka “The
Wave”)

   The Third Wave (now known simply as The Wave), was the infamous 1967
   California classroom experiment in fascism by high school history
   teacher Ron Jones. As both he and the students were carried away, it
   quickly got out of control in a matter of days. This story has been
   portrayed in two previous movies – “The Wave” on ABC-TV in 1981 by
   Norman Lear which received an Emmy, and in 2008 the award-winning
   German film “Die Welle.” The novelization of the 1981 movie by Todd
   Strasser has sold 8 million copies in classrooms all around the world.
   There are also theater plays and even musicals about the story.

   Now, here in the documentary film “Lesson Plan,” the original students
   and teacher share their experience and the lessons they learned in the
   true story of The Third Wave. The Wave story is widely used to show
   students the elements of extremism, with its demanding charismatic
   leaders and intolerant group-think masses. Timely lessons for all of us
   in today’s world.

The story of the Third Wave experiment as told by the students and their
teacher, Ron Jones

   Lesson Plan is the documentary about the 1967 Third Wave experiment in
   fascism that took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto,
   California. The charismatic teacher, Ron Jones, created a classroom
   setting wherein students subjugated personal freedom for the good of
   the community. Within one week, 30 students grew to 200. Taking on a
   life of its own, the Third Wave students unwittingly re-enacted the
   roots of the Third Reich. Replete with salutes and Gestapo-like
   informants, the experiment soon attracted scores of students throughout
   Cubberley as well as from neighboring schools, spiraling the exercise
   not only out of Jones’ control but the students’ as well. Original
   students, Ron Jones, school administrators and Dr. Philip Zimbardo
   (creator of the Stanford Prison Experiment) have been interviewed for
   this film. What makes the film so unique is that the Executive
   Producer/Director and Associate Producer were members of the original
   Third Wave class.

   Spring, 1967: Disillusionment, anger and confusion bubble to the
   surface of the nation’s psyche. American youth are on the precipice of
   a social revolution and, for a few tumultuous days Ron Jones, a young,
   gifted, high school history teacher attempts a startling social
   experiment that will inspire comment and analysis to this day. In 1967,
   Ron Jones was in his first year teaching at progressive, upper-middle
   class Cubberley High School, responsible for instructing World History
   to 10th grade students. He had a dynamic connection with his students
   who recall him being “one of us”. Eager to shake up the political
   consciousness of his pupils, Jones launched an experiment over the
   course of several days, igniting a firestorm.

   To explain the appeal of fascism in Nazi Germany, he created a
   classroom setting wherein students subjugated personal freedom to the
   good of the community, following almost without question. Replete with
   salutes and Gestapo-like informants, the so-called Third Wave soon
   attracted scores of students throughout Cubberley and neighboring
   schools, spiraling out of Jones’ control. This moving recounting by
   Jones, former students, school administrators, and many others
   enthralls with the force of inescapable conclusions, and demonstrates
   how its theme has only grown in relevance.
