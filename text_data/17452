About Us

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)

     We work with health care professionals and public health officials
     around the world to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and
     mortality.


     Through resources such as evidence-based strategy documents for
     asthma management, and events such as the annual celebration of
     World Asthma Day, GINA is working to improve the lives of people
     with asthma in every corner of the globe.

Who Are We?

   GINA was launched in 1993 in collaboration with the National Heart,
   Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA, and the
   World Health Organization.

   GINA’s program is determined and its strategies for asthma care are
   shaped by committees made up of leading asthma experts from around the
   world.
   Read more about who is involved with GINA Committees.

GINA Objectives

     * Increase awareness of asthma and its public health consequences.
     * Promote identification of reasons for the increased prevalence of
       asthma.
     * Promote study of the association between asthma and the
       environment.
     * Reduce asthma morbidity and mortality.
     * Improve management of asthma.
     * Improve availability and accessibility of effective asthma therapy.

GINA Operations

   As of July 1, 2014, GINA’s activities are funded entirely by the sale
   of its documents and resources. These materials may be downloaded from
   the GINA Website; printed copies may be purchased for a fee. For
   information on how to purchase printed copies, please contact us.

Guidelines and Reports

   The GINA global strategy for asthma management and prevention is
   presented in its strategy documents, which are freely available on the
   GINA Website.

   The GINA Scientific Committee prepares updates to these documents each
   year, which are made available on the GINA Website as they are
   completed. The Scientific Committee has developed a sophisticated set
   of procedures to review the world’s literature with regards to asthma
   management and to update the GINA documents to reflect this
   state-of-the-art information.

World Asthma Day

   GINA organizes World Asthma Day, which is held on the first Tuesday in
   May, in collaboration with health care groups and asthma educators
   throughout the world.

   Each year GINA chooses a theme and coordinates preparation and
   distribution of World Asthma Day materials and resources. GINA also
   maintains the World Asthma Day Internet Headquarters, where materials
   and resources are posted for downloading and a complete listing of
   activities around the world is constantly updated.

   The first World Asthma Day, in 1998, was celebrated in more than 35
   countries in conjunction with the first World Asthma Meeting held in
   Barcelona, Spain. Participation has increased with each World Asthma
   Day held since then, and the day has become one of the world’s most
   important asthma awareness and education events.
