Meet Amanda Weigel, 2016 Raskin Scholar

   by ESIP Comunication | Jun 20, 2016 | Uncategorized

   Amanda Weigel is a graduate student in Earth system science and
   Research Associate with the Global Hydrology Resource Center
   Distributed Active Archive Center at the University of Alabama in
   Huntsville’s (UAH) Information Technology and Systems Center. She was
   recently awarded the 2016 Robert G. Raskin scholarship by ESIP,
   and answered a few questions about her academic path, research
   interests and career goals.

   What was your academic path?
   Growing up I had an interest in the atmosphere and space. When I
   graduated from high school, there wasn't a place in Virginia that
   offered a degree in meteorology or atmospheric science, so upon an
   adviser's recommendation, I enrolled as a physics major at Virginia
   Tech. Having never taken a physics class, the program was not the right
   fit, so I withdrew and investigated other options for a year until I
   discovered Virginia Tech was about to start the first meteorology
   program in the state. I ended up double majoring in meteorology and
   geography, and minoring in geoscience, which provided an
   interdisciplinary education that drove me to pursue a master’s in Earth
   System Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). My
   academic path allowed me to acquire experience and education in
   atmospheric science, Earth science, geography, geoscience, and data
   science, and has since led me to continue on for a doctorate in
   atmospheric science from UAH.

   What are some of the unique things you're currently working on?
   I’m working on research that developed a method for analyzing and
   quantifying relationships between land surface heterogeneity and
   tornado genesis. My work also involves supporting NASA Marshall Space
   Flight Center’s Data Science and Informatics Group’s ongoing research
   to design knowledge graphs that improve the search and discovery of
   data and resources within atmospheric science. I find this work
   interesting because it crosses scientific fields by blending land
   surface remote sensing with atmospheric science, and data science with
   atmospheric science. In addition, I work as part of the Science Team at
   the Global Hydrology Resource Center DAAC providing scientific
   expertise for the data management, tool and software development, and
   science outreach.

   What types of technology do you use in your research?
   Traditionally, my research has involved using geospatial and remote
   sensing software such as ArcGIS and ENVI. However, more recently my
   research has transitioned to using Python programming to automate and
   perform most tasks. I have also worked with Neo4j and CMap to build
   information models and knowledge graphs.

   What challenges do you face related to data and software?
   The biggest challenge I have faced is combining satellite remote
   sensing and geospatial data analysis techniques, which involves drawing
   methods and tools from traditional image processing and GIS analysis.
   Current GIS software is built for 32-bit operating systems, which
   greatly limits the processing power available for scientific analysis.
   Writing programs for automated analysis becomes a very delicate process
   to avoid memory errors, making it difficult to perform an analysis
   across multiple, large data files. In addition, geospatial data is
   formatted differently that most remotely sensed datasets, so it takes a
   lot of effort to convert them both to the same format, especially since
   most GIS software does not handle NetCDF and HDF formats well.

   What are some of your career goals—and how do you expect the
   scholarship will help you meet these?
   Until recently I foresaw a career working to develop GIS methods for
   atmospheric science research and operations, in particular,
   land-atmosphere interactions in severe weather. As I have become more
   knowledgeable of research in data and computer science, I have become
   aware of techniques that can be applied to atmospheric research,
   specifically since much is still performed manually. The scholarship
   will provide me the opportunity to continue this discovery of knowledge
   and interact with individuals working to bring the best data,
   information and methods together for Earth science research and
   applications.

   Amanda will attend and present at the 2016 ESIP Summer Meeting, July
   19-22 in Durham, N.C. as part of her award package.

   Through the ESIP Lab project, the team worked to refine an optical wave
   gauging technique to estimate wave height and/or wave period from
   imagery of coastal waves and nearshore areas.
     * The technique utilizes a concept known as deep learning, which is a
       class of machine learning techniques that use large neural network
       models to automatically learn how to map one data set (in this
       case, imagery of coastal surf zones) to another (in this case, wave
       quantities).
     * The deep learning model automatically and iteratively solves a
       regression task, using only how it has learned to relate variation
       in wave height and period to subtle variations of tone, contrast,
       saturation, etc., that collectively indicate a different dynamic
       states. It does this by using very deep (hence the name) neural
       networks that are designed to extract only the relevant features of
       the imagery.
     * The technique is based on deep convolutional neural networks
       (CNNs), which are state-of-the-art deep learning models for image
       feature extraction.
     * The optical wave gage (OWG) consists of an existing generic CNN
       model to extract features from imagery – called a `base model',
       with additional layers to distill the feature information into
       lower dimensional spaces, and a final layer of dense neurons to
       predict wave statistics.
     * Given enough training data, the model can calibrate well to a site
       despite variation in lighting, weather, transient objects, tide,
       and morphological changes of beaches.
     * Currently, this data-driven technique must be trained separately
       for each site. Next steps include investigating more generic models
       that could be applied more generally, and investigating the
       feasibility on on-board camera processing for real-time estimates.
