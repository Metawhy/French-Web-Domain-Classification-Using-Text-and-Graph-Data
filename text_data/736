Sterling Silver Jewelry

What Are the Different Types of Silver?

   Every piece of jewelry’s silver and quality content has to be indicated
   accurately. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has created a set of
   countermark and identification markers indicating silver materials in
   jewelry, which should be assessed when purchasing a piece. Only jewelry
   with sterling silver content equal to or exceeding 92.5 percent may be
   called silver jewelry. Sometimes, silver jewelry can also be engraved
   with such characters as .925, 9·2.5 or even 925.  These marks are
   acceptable identification marks that guarantee you bought sterling
   silver containing the standard composition of silver and nickel.

What Should I Look For When Buying Sterling Silver Jewelry?

   In purchasing silver jewelry, you should also check the jewelry maker’s
   signature or review the hallmark of jewelry.  Professional jewelry will
   have clear hallmarks that you can use to identify the manufacturer. The
   cost of silver jewelry and gifts made from silver is set by the price
   of the raw material and the silversmith’s workmanship.  When buying
   silver earrings, bracelets, or necklaces, the buyer should exercise
   extra care to make sure the clasp is able to fasten firmly.  You don’t
   want your new jewelry falling off your body after you are so careful to
   choose the right piece.

Is Sterling Silver Good?

   If you are purchasing a silver necklace you should spread it out to
   check if the loops twist together or warp. When you are buying an
   accessory you should check plating thickness and make sure the plating
   is complete. Generally, quantifiable purity of silver jewelry is split
   into following types: 99 represents pure silver, but theoretically 100%
   purity is considered as pure silver, it’s difficult to obtain 100%
   purity.  98% represents good silver, consisting of 2% nickel, which can
   be marked 980S and 98% silver. 925 silver consists of 92.5% silver and
   7.5 percent nickel, which is marked 925 on the jewelry. Nearly all of
   silver jewelry is made of sterling silver. 925 silver jewelry after
   polishing reveals gorgeous metallic luster and has particular toughness
   for gem setting and making medium-to-high-grade jewelry.

   Silver can be a great alternative to white gold.  It is much less
   expensive and looks just as good!
