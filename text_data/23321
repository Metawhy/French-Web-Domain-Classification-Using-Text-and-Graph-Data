BETTER, TOGETHER


   With enrollment of just over 12,000 students, Arkansas Tech University
   is now the third largest institution of higher learning in the state.
   Despite our phenomenal growth we know it’s not the size of the dog in
   the fight but the fight in the dog that counts. Like our beloved Jerry
   the Bulldog, tenacity and grit are part of our DNA.

   Determination has guided ATU faculty and staff in their design of an
   institution geared toward academic excellence. With a
   student/instructor ratio of 18 to 1, free tutoring, one-on-one academic
   coaching, developing  a customized strategy for student success and an
   academic advising center, our students are never just a number.


   At ATU, we're a family and we help each other succeed.

   else in the nation. And it sets you up for success right after
   graduation. It’s why Arkansas Tech University was ranked the No. 1
   college for upward social mobility in Arkansas and why we have alumni
   working in 35 different countries around the world.
