   I am a Senior Lecturer at the School of Electronic Engineering and
   Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, and member of the
   Theory Group. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the
   Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, and member
   of the Quantum Group, where I also completed my PhD thesis.

   My focus is on Theoretical Computer Science and in particular I study
   the mathematical meaning of computation. I devise mathematical models
   of programming languages, expressed in game semantics at the concrete
   level and in category theory at the abstract level. I examine
   applications of these models to program analysis in order to develop
   methods and tools for formally analysing and checking software.
