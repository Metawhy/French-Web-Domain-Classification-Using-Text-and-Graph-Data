   Michele Romanow is the co-founder and President of Clearbanc: the
   fastest, most affordable way for founders to fund their business.

   Recently named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum,
   Michele is a prolific investor who plans to invest $1 billion into
   2,000 businesses this year and will continue to fund 8X more
   female-founded companies than traditional VC firms. Using AI to vet
   companies and tailor term sheet offers without gender, racial, or
   location biases, Clearbanc’s 20-Min Term Sheet is the industry’s first
   and fastest way to get growth capital without losing board seats or
   controlling interest.

   As a “Dragon” on CBC’s hit show Dragons’ Den (Canada’s Shark Tank),
   Michele started five companies before her 33rd birthday and exited two
   before her 30th. She previously co-founded SnapSaves (acquired by
   Groupon) and was also the co-Founder of Buytopia.ca, which acquired ten
   competitors including Shop.ca and WagJag.

   Neil Rimer co-founded Index Ventures in Geneva in 1996.

   His vision was to support the most ambitious entrepreneurs, bringing
   Silicon Valley-style investing to Europe at a time when “venture
   capital” was still a new term outside the US. As he recalled in a
   Financial Times interview: “We started every meeting with a slide that
   was literally ‘What is VC?’”

   20 years on, while staying true to its European roots, Index has become
   one of the world’s leading venture capital firms, with principal
   offices in London and San Francisco. So far, the firm has raised $7.25
   billion and has more than 160 companies in its portfolio.

   Today, Neil works with entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic,
   among them the founders of Deliveroo, Funding Circle, Roblox and
   Typeform. He previously led Index investments in companies including
   Betfair, Climate, Supercell and Trello.

   Born in Montreal, Neil graduated in History and Economics at Stanford,
   and gained an MBA from Harvard Business School. He spent four years
   with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, and joined Index
   Securities in 1990 – the predecessor to Index Ventures. Neil is also on
   the board of the non-profit, non-governmental organization, Human
   Rights Watch.

   in Europe, Coupang in South Korea, and Flipkart and Oyo Rooms in India.

   Llewellyn is the Co-founder and President of African FinTech company,
   OVAMBA. Ovambo connects African SMEs to sources of short‐term capital
   to fund their growth. She has a talent of overseeing strategy, business
   development & investor relations globally. She and her team created a
   proprietary, culturally sensitive algorithm to measure SME risk within
   the African context. Ms. Llewellyn is on the Board of Directors of
   ActivSpaces, AH Partners, European Women in Payment Network and the
   International Women’s Think Tank. Ms. Llewellyn has spent over 15 years

   Sequoia Heritage, the firm’s single pool of globally diversified,
   long-term assets; and Sequoia Capital Global Equities, a public market
   fund. Michael has represented Sequoia on the boards of a number of
   companies including Yahoo!, PayPal, Google, LinkedIn, and Kayak; and
   younger businesses such as Instacart, Klarna and Stripe. Prior to
   joining Sequoia, Michael co-founded Technologic Partners and was a
   correspondent for Time, where he was the San Francisco bureau chief.

   Manchester United. Michael graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1976
   with a MA in History and is an Honorary Student of the College.
   Together with his wife, Harriet Heyman, he has made a series of major
   donations to educational causes. He received a knighthood from the

   and the law, and is an expert on content moderation and the movement
   from online conduct to offline violence. She advises tech companies,

   Together with Hans Rosling and Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund
   founded Gapminder in 2005. Gapminder’s mission statement is to fight
   devastating ignorance with a fact-based world view everyone can
   understand.

   She designed the user-interface of the famous animating bubble-chart
   tool called Trendalyzer, used by millions of students across the world,
   to understand global development trends. The tool was acquired by
   Google, and Anna worked at Google in Mountain View, CA as a Senior
   Usability Designer 2007 to 2010. At Google Anna improved search results
   for public data, developed data exploration tools for Public Data and
   made a bubble tool gadget (Motion chart) in Google Spreadsheets. In
   2010 Anna came back to Gapminder to develop new free teaching material.
   Anna is now Vice President and Head of Design & User Experience at
   Gapminder. She also sits in the Gapminder Board. Anna holds a Master’s
   Degree in Sociology and a Bachelor’s Degree in Photography.

   Anna founded Dollar Street, the biggest systematic image bank with
   representative home documentations based on data. At the moment we have
   almost 30 000 photos and 10 000 video clips, which are free to use
   under Creative Common license.

   Blake Scholl founded Boom Supersonic in September 2014 with the goal of
   making high-speed travel mainstream and enabling a new world of human
   connection. Blake is passionate about tackling big problems which the
   world has overlooked. After seeing Concorde in a museum, he dreamed of
   the return of commercial supersonic flight. A few years later, Blake
   dove into aerospace engineering—reading textbooks and taking classes—to
   figure out from first principles how to enable a supersonic
   renaissance. As a leader, Blake focuses on inspiring the best people
   from a range of disciplines to unite in pursuit of Boom’s vision.

   Prior to founding Boom, Blake held leadership roles at Amazon and
   Groupon and co-founded mobile technology startup Kima Labs. He started
   his career at Amazon as a software engineer in 2001, where he developed
   software for personalized and automated merchandising and later owned a
   $300M P&L at age 24. Blake pioneered the automation of digital ad
   buying, enabling advertisers to build their own “long tail” by
   promoting niche products to relevant customers. Later, Blake was the
   first employee and director of product development at Kleiner-backed
   mobile startup Pelago. In 2010, he co-founded mobile technology startup
   Kima Labs, which was acquired by Groupon in 2012. At Groupon, Blake
   held multiple executive roles, culminating in responsibility for the
   relevance, email, and search.

   Blake’s interest in aviation on started in childhood—he grew up in
   suburban Cincinnati, where his parents often took him to the local
   airport to watch Cessnas take off and land. He started flying for fun
   in college, earning his private pilot license in 2008 and instrument
   rating in 2011.

   Blake holds a BS in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University;
   he lives in Denver and is the father of three.
