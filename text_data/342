Wedding Wednesday:)

      Shew ... whoever said planning a wedding is stressful was RIGHT!

                               Good grief ...

           I always said I would never be the stressed out bride.

    I would be the "go with the flow" never crazy or bitchy, just excited
                                and happy ...

      Welllll, that bird has flown the coup friends .. I am officially
                                  stressed!

              (of course not crazy or bitchy though..yet! ha!)

   [86294b443f03d5cc557ed2a5b63b3dd9.jpg]

                       hahahahaha this is hysterical!

    Don't fret, this is not me, there are probably only about 3 people in
    the world I would actually like to punch in the throat, and they have
                    nothing to do with the wedding lol!!

    (and no no no I won't name them, I'm not talking bad about people for
                             lent this year ha)

    I think it is all the small little details that I am stressing about
   (not to mention I have OCD) and then also just getting things done in a
    timely manner when you work 60 hours a week and try to have a life at
          the same time, makes things a little more difficult too.

   Plus don't even get me started on how expensive all this stuff is!! Who
    knew forks and tables and bathrooms could add up to be so much? Every
   time I get on Pinterest I feel like I need to order something else ...
       Or I make a decision on something and get on Pinterest and see
               something totally different that I like better!

   [f9b3c443e172a7a6742a137b9f4c144b.jpg]

                     hahaha again, hysterical and true.

   Poor Chris... I told him today the wedding is just going to be a total
   surprise party to him because I tell him something, then change my mind
                 and forgot to tell him the new idea lol ;)

            He is so sweet ... he mostly cared about 4 things ...

                                 1. The food

                                 2. The cake

           3. Me wearing my hair down and wavy like he likes it ha

               4. and just marrying me ... and being happy :)

     So sweet, I know, but that is truly what he says and what he cared
     about, the rest he said he trusts my taste and judgement and I have
    never picked out anything thus far in our house, clothes, etc that he
                                didn't like.

    I think he will like everything ... if not .. you know what they say
                                     ...

   [810627ce28e75f9df6729ac3dd7e512e.jpg]

               I am full of these today, can you tell? hahahaha

           In all reality ... I am in love with my wedding dress.

     It hasn't come in yet, but I look at the pictures of it daily on my
                          phone ha. I just love it.

              BUT ... does anybody but me have this feeling ...

   [7e3e403e5439070a4036eed0a267667b.jpg]
   I am TERRIFIED that I will see another dress I like more!!
   So I keep trying to skim past them really fast when I am scrolling down
   Pinterest lol
   We for serious need a filter for this!! ;)
   So today I met with my florist and in all honesty it made me feel so
   much better!
   I am so excited about the flowers and decor ... and wanted to share a
   sneak peak ...
   [photo+1+(63).jpg]
   Obsessed with these!
   Some of the tables will have the tall arrangements with the birch
   wrapping which I am in love with .. but lots more flowers in them (this
   was a fake arrangement for sale in there for inside a house) so mine
   will have more flowers and blush tones with more moss etc! So cute!
   [photo+2+(66).jpg]
   We will have the urns with candles everywhere on some tables ... just
   kind of to give it some dimension something different with the flowers
   too :)
   [photo+3+(56).jpg]
   Lots of barnwood like this with cutouts for the candles and then
   instead of those little green things these will be moss and hydrangeas
   and blush roses etc! Sooo pretty and elegant :)
   [586075e4d45e4d82834adbcdcdd69914.jpg]
   I decided on these for all the guys ... I think they are perfect. Just
   the perfect touch of elegance yet still a little rustic too ;) Chris's
   will be a little different I think to make him stand out.
   So all in all today we actually got a lot accomplished and I am super
   excited about all the flowers, but want to leave some big things with
   them a secret ... so you'll have to wait on those!! ;)
   I am getting more and more excited ... just need to get all the small
   stuff knocked out so I can make it to June and then ...
   [b03f0c428b4c46169ba373c1e446f93c.jpg]
   hahahahaha
   killing me today.
   No but really, this is what I am trying to keep in mind:
   [726f1be97919ae622e539cf85fcfc2aa.jpg]

                                  So true.

                                  Love it.

          Well, that's all the wedding talk I've got for ya today!

    I am going to share our Save the Date's later this week also .. just
                     need to get a good picture of them!

    PS. Look at this sweet, handsome baby on his walk this week ... just
                    taking in the sunshine and breeze ...

   [58859_10100361268558817_1440379749_n.jpg]

                              Love him so much.

       PSS. My Bellatique giveaway is over tonight with a whopping 354
                                  entries!!

     Wow! So tomorrow I will announce the winner winner chicken dinner!

   [IMG_0617.JPG]
   Saw this on Pinterest.
   Loved it. Perfect for Valentine's Day.
   Frankie sent out his Valentine to all his peeps ;)
   [IMG_0618.JPG]
   I made a little eCard for Chris and shared on his Fbook page early that
   morning so he would see it when he checked it that morning ;)
   [IMG_0619.JPG]
   [IMG_0669.JPG]

     I had my cute little XOXO burlap banner I got from Very Jane and my
          Happy Everything plate with the Valentine envelope on it!



    The kids were here so we had a Valentine's Party and Chris's parents
                           came down to celebrate!
   We cooked dinner and played games and opened Vday presents and just had
                             a super fun night!

    (Chris and I celebrated Friday night, just us, with dinner and such!)

     Chris had my two favorite things ready for me before the party ...

   [IMG_0625.JPG]

     Chocolate Covered Strawberries from Confused Confections Bakehouse

                                     and

          The Bacon Cheddar Ring from DaRae & Friend's Catering ...

                               Yyyyuuummmm :)

                           (so much for the diet!)

    I had ordered some special cookies for the kiddos ... and they turned
                                out adorable!

   [IMG_0660.JPG]

                              How cute is that?

                 They were adorable and the kids LOVED them!

   [IMG_0663.JPG]

   [IMG_0662.JPG]
   Silly girls ;)
   Pics from Her Knight Dance
   I had been wanting to share a couple of pics from the Father/Daughter
   Dance at our church that Chris took the girls too last weekend ... I
   just love that they went and they had so much fun...
   they will remember that first dance for the rest of their lives :)
   I had so much fun getting them all dolled up before their big night!
   That is a memory that I will remember the rest of my life ;)
   [IMG_0517.JPG]

   Sooo cute! :)
   [IMG_0561.JPG]
   They had this at the Keene Barn in Keeneland and it looked from the
   pics that Chris took that it was just so much fun and such a blessing
   to be at. :)
   So I tried to find a picture of me and good ole' Dan (my dad ha) just
   while I was uploading these pics of Chris and the girls .. and I found
   this little beauty to share with yall ....

   dad looked ridiculous.
   I mean what in the world was with the stach and the hair? hahaha too
   much for me to handle.
   I don't think I was in a smiling mood that day, probably because my mom
   cut those bangs!! Ha!

   ;)
