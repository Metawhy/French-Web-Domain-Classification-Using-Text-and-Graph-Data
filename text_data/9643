Oceanography

   Looking at our Earth from space, it is obvious that we live on a water
   planet. Ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and contains about
   97% of the Earth's surface water. Life in the oceans can be found from
   the surface to the extreme environments at the bottom of the deepest
   submarine trench. It is not surprising that the oceans represent over
   99% of the living space on Earth...we are indeed living on what is
   truly an ocean planet.

Why does NASA study the ocean?

   Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total
   Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on
   the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing
   changes in the world's climate and weather. Collecting and analyzing
   long-term ocean data from satellites is a relatively new field of
   exploration. The analysis of remotely-sensed ocean data makes it
   possible to understand the ocean in new and exciting ways.

   Prior to satellite data, most of what we have learned about the oceans
   had come from infrequent measurements collected from ships, buoys, and
   drifters. Ship-based oceanographers are limited to sampling the ocean
   in a relatively small area with often a great deal of difficulty. Data
   from ships, buoys, and drifters are not sufficient to characterize the
   conditions of the spatially diverse of the ocean.
   The advent of ocean-observing satellites has launched a new era of
   marine discovery. Remotely sensed satellite data and modeling
   techniques enable the global mapping of seasonal changes in ocean
   surface topography, currents, waves, winds, phytoplankton content,
   sea-ice extent, rainfall, sunlight reaching the sea, and sea surface
   temperature. Studying these patterns at a global scale help forecast
   and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought. Images
   generated by ocean observing satellite missions tell us volumes about
   the most fundamental climate changes. During the last decade,
   forecasting models have benefited from satellite data as they have
   improved the ability to predict events such as El Niño and other global
   and regional climate cycles. These models will become more
   sophisticated as scientists and forecasters further develop the ability
   to simulate certain ocean phenomena and thus better predict when they
   will occur.
   Using remote sensing data and computer models, scientists can now
   investigate how the oceans affect the evolution of weather, hurricanes,
   and climate. Oceans control the Earth's weather as they heat and cool,
   humidify and dry the air and control wind speed and direction. And the
   weather determines not just what you'll wear to work in the week
   ahead--but also whether the wheat crop in Nebraska will get enough rain
   to mature, whether the snow pack in the Sierras will be thick enough to
   water southern California, whether the hurricane season in the Atlantic
   will be mellow or brutal, whether eastern Pacific fisheries will be
   decimated by El Niño. Long-term weather patterns influence water
   supply, food supply, trade shipments, and property values. They can
   even foster the growth of civilizations, or kill them off. You can't
   escape the weather, or even change it--but being able to predict its
   caprice makes its impact manageable. And only by understanding the
   dynamics of the oceans can we begin to do this.
   NASA has been observing the oceans from space for more than 20 years.
   NASA launched Seasat, the first civilian oceanographic satellite, on
   June 28, 1978. The satellite carried five complementary sensors
   designed to monitor the oceans from space. These sensors included:
     * a radar altimeter to measure spacecraft height above the ocean
       surface
     * a microwave scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction
     * a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer to measure sea surface
       temperature
     * a visible and infrared radiometer to identify cloud, land and water
       features
     * a synthetic aperture radar to monitor the global surface wave field
       and polar sea ice conditions

   Although a massive short-circuit in its power system ended all
   data-taking operations after only 105 days, the Seasat instruments
   provided as much oceanographic data as had been acquired by ships in
   the previous 100 years! The variables that Seasat measured in its short
   lifetime are some of the most important for understanding the ocean and
   its role in climate.
   Another satellite, Tiros-N, was also launched in 1978. It carried the
   first AVHRR sensor which produced the first really useful maps of
   sea-surface temperature, and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, that
   produced the first maps of chlorophyll and primary productivity in the
   ocean.
   Today there are several ocean-observing satellite missions and an
   extensive scientific research community studying these data. Each
   mission provides its own unique contribution to our knowledge of the
   ocean, however our understanding is rapidly evolving such that we are
   coming to more fully understand the role that each parameter plays in
   the constantly changing conditions and cycles of the ocean and thus on
   climate and weather.

Ocean Exploration at NASA

   NASA is the exploration agency of the Federal Government. NASA Earth
   observing satellites often open up new vistas for Earth science
   research. All are meant to explore the envelope of what is known and
   understood about the physical, chemical and biological processes of the
   planet. Learn more about Ocean Exploration at NASA.

What Happened to all the Snow?

   Play ScienceCast Video Join Mailing List

   Jan. 19, 2012: Winter seems to have been on hold this year in some
   parts of the United States. Snowfall has been scarce so far in places
   that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year.
   Missing Snow (bare dirt, 200px)
   California dog driver Tony Phillips poses with his new sled near
   Mammoth Mountain. In winter 2011 this spot was covered by several feet
   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.

Oceanography

   Looking at our Earth from space, it is obvious that we live on a water
   planet. Ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and contains about
   97% of the Earth's surface water. Life in the oceans can be found from
   the surface to the extreme environments at the bottom of the deepest
   submarine trench. It is not surprising that the oceans represent over
   99% of the living space on Earth...we are indeed living on what is
   truly an ocean planet.

Why does NASA study the ocean?

   Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total
   Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on
   the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing
   changes in the world's climate and weather. Collecting and analyzing
   long-term ocean data from satellites is a relatively new field of
   exploration. The analysis of remotely-sensed ocean data makes it
   possible to understand the ocean in new and exciting ways.

   Prior to satellite data, most of what we have learned about the oceans
   had come from infrequent measurements collected from ships, buoys, and
   drifters. Ship-based oceanographers are limited to sampling the ocean
   in a relatively small area with often a great deal of difficulty. Data
   from ships, buoys, and drifters are not sufficient to characterize the
   conditions of the spatially diverse of the ocean.
   The advent of ocean-observing satellites has launched a new era of
   marine discovery. Remotely sensed satellite data and modeling
   techniques enable the global mapping of seasonal changes in ocean
   surface topography, currents, waves, winds, phytoplankton content,
   sea-ice extent, rainfall, sunlight reaching the sea, and sea surface
   temperature. Studying these patterns at a global scale help forecast
   and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought. Images
   generated by ocean observing satellite missions tell us volumes about
   the most fundamental climate changes. During the last decade,
   forecasting models have benefited from satellite data as they have
   improved the ability to predict events such as El Niño and other global
   and regional climate cycles. These models will become more
   sophisticated as scientists and forecasters further develop the ability
   to simulate certain ocean phenomena and thus better predict when they
   will occur.
   Using remote sensing data and computer models, scientists can now
   investigate how the oceans affect the evolution of weather, hurricanes,
   and climate. Oceans control the Earth's weather as they heat and cool,
   humidify and dry the air and control wind speed and direction. And the
   weather determines not just what you'll wear to work in the week
   ahead--but also whether the wheat crop in Nebraska will get enough rain
   to mature, whether the snow pack in the Sierras will be thick enough to
   water southern California, whether the hurricane season in the Atlantic
   will be mellow or brutal, whether eastern Pacific fisheries will be
   decimated by El Niño. Long-term weather patterns influence water
   supply, food supply, trade shipments, and property values. They can
   even foster the growth of civilizations, or kill them off. You can't
   escape the weather, or even change it--but being able to predict its
   caprice makes its impact manageable. And only by understanding the
   dynamics of the oceans can we begin to do this.
   NASA has been observing the oceans from space for more than 20 years.
   NASA launched Seasat, the first civilian oceanographic satellite, on
   June 28, 1978. The satellite carried five complementary sensors
   designed to monitor the oceans from space. These sensors included:
     * a radar altimeter to measure spacecraft height above the ocean
       surface
     * a microwave scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction
     * a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer to measure sea surface
       temperature
     * a visible and infrared radiometer to identify cloud, land and water
       features
     * a synthetic aperture radar to monitor the global surface wave field
       and polar sea ice conditions

   Although a massive short-circuit in its power system ended all
   data-taking operations after only 105 days, the Seasat instruments
   provided as much oceanographic data as had been acquired by ships in
   the previous 100 years! The variables that Seasat measured in its short
   lifetime are some of the most important for understanding the ocean and
   its role in climate.
   Another satellite, Tiros-N, was also launched in 1978. It carried the
   first AVHRR sensor which produced the first really useful maps of
   sea-surface temperature, and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, that
   produced the first maps of chlorophyll and primary productivity in the
   ocean.
   Today there are several ocean-observing satellite missions and an
   extensive scientific research community studying these data. Each
   mission provides its own unique contribution to our knowledge of the
   ocean, however our understanding is rapidly evolving such that we are
   coming to more fully understand the role that each parameter plays in
   the constantly changing conditions and cycles of the ocean and thus on
   climate and weather.

Ocean Exploration at NASA

   NASA is the exploration agency of the Federal Government. NASA Earth
   observing satellites often open up new vistas for Earth science
   research. All are meant to explore the envelope of what is known and
   understood about the physical, chemical and biological processes of the
   planet. Learn more about Ocean Exploration at NASA.

What Happened to all the Snow?

   Play ScienceCast Video Join Mailing List

   Jan. 19, 2012: Winter seems to have been on hold this year in some
   parts of the United States. Snowfall has been scarce so far in places
   that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year.

   Mammoth Mountain. In winter 2011 this spot was covered by several feet
   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.

What Happened to all the Snow?

   Play ScienceCast Video Join Mailing List

   Jan. 19, 2012: Winter seems to have been on hold this year in some
   parts of the United States. Snowfall has been scarce so far in places
   that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year.
   Missing Snow (bare dirt, 200px)
   California dog driver Tony Phillips poses with his new sled near
   Mammoth Mountain. In winter 2011 this spot was covered by several feet
   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.

Oceanography

   Looking at our Earth from space, it is obvious that we live on a water
   planet. Ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and contains about
   97% of the Earth's surface water. Life in the oceans can be found from
   the surface to the extreme environments at the bottom of the deepest
   submarine trench. It is not surprising that the oceans represent over
   99% of the living space on Earth...we are indeed living on what is
   truly an ocean planet.

Why does NASA study the ocean?

   Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total
   Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on
   the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing
   changes in the world's climate and weather. Collecting and analyzing
   long-term ocean data from satellites is a relatively new field of
   exploration. The analysis of remotely-sensed ocean data makes it
   possible to understand the ocean in new and exciting ways.

   Prior to satellite data, most of what we have learned about the oceans
   had come from infrequent measurements collected from ships, buoys, and
   drifters. Ship-based oceanographers are limited to sampling the ocean
   in a relatively small area with often a great deal of difficulty. Data
   from ships, buoys, and drifters are not sufficient to characterize the
   conditions of the spatially diverse of the ocean.
   The advent of ocean-observing satellites has launched a new era of
   marine discovery. Remotely sensed satellite data and modeling
   techniques enable the global mapping of seasonal changes in ocean
   surface topography, currents, waves, winds, phytoplankton content,
   sea-ice extent, rainfall, sunlight reaching the sea, and sea surface
   temperature. Studying these patterns at a global scale help forecast
   and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought. Images
   generated by ocean observing satellite missions tell us volumes about
   the most fundamental climate changes. During the last decade,
   forecasting models have benefited from satellite data as they have
   improved the ability to predict events such as El Niño and other global
   and regional climate cycles. These models will become more
   sophisticated as scientists and forecasters further develop the ability
   to simulate certain ocean phenomena and thus better predict when they
   will occur.
   Using remote sensing data and computer models, scientists can now
   investigate how the oceans affect the evolution of weather, hurricanes,
   and climate. Oceans control the Earth's weather as they heat and cool,
   humidify and dry the air and control wind speed and direction. And the
   weather determines not just what you'll wear to work in the week
   ahead--but also whether the wheat crop in Nebraska will get enough rain
   to mature, whether the snow pack in the Sierras will be thick enough to
   water southern California, whether the hurricane season in the Atlantic
   will be mellow or brutal, whether eastern Pacific fisheries will be
   decimated by El Niño. Long-term weather patterns influence water
   supply, food supply, trade shipments, and property values. They can
   even foster the growth of civilizations, or kill them off. You can't
   escape the weather, or even change it--but being able to predict its
   caprice makes its impact manageable. And only by understanding the
   dynamics of the oceans can we begin to do this.
   NASA has been observing the oceans from space for more than 20 years.
   NASA launched Seasat, the first civilian oceanographic satellite, on
   June 28, 1978. The satellite carried five complementary sensors
   designed to monitor the oceans from space. These sensors included:
     * a radar altimeter to measure spacecraft height above the ocean
       surface
     * a microwave scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction
     * a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer to measure sea surface
       temperature
     * a visible and infrared radiometer to identify cloud, land and water
       features
     * a synthetic aperture radar to monitor the global surface wave field
       and polar sea ice conditions

   Although a massive short-circuit in its power system ended all
   data-taking operations after only 105 days, the Seasat instruments
   provided as much oceanographic data as had been acquired by ships in
   the previous 100 years! The variables that Seasat measured in its short
   lifetime are some of the most important for understanding the ocean and
   its role in climate.
   Another satellite, Tiros-N, was also launched in 1978. It carried the
   first AVHRR sensor which produced the first really useful maps of
   sea-surface temperature, and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, that
   produced the first maps of chlorophyll and primary productivity in the
   ocean.
   Today there are several ocean-observing satellite missions and an
   extensive scientific research community studying these data. Each
   mission provides its own unique contribution to our knowledge of the
   ocean, however our understanding is rapidly evolving such that we are
   coming to more fully understand the role that each parameter plays in
   the constantly changing conditions and cycles of the ocean and thus on
   climate and weather.

Ocean Exploration at NASA

   NASA is the exploration agency of the Federal Government. NASA Earth
   observing satellites often open up new vistas for Earth science
   research. All are meant to explore the envelope of what is known and
   understood about the physical, chemical and biological processes of the
   planet. Learn more about Ocean Exploration at NASA.

   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.

Oceanography

   Looking at our Earth from space, it is obvious that we live on a water
   planet. Ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and contains about
   97% of the Earth's surface water. Life in the oceans can be found from
   the surface to the extreme environments at the bottom of the deepest
   submarine trench. It is not surprising that the oceans represent over
   99% of the living space on Earth...we are indeed living on what is
   truly an ocean planet.

Why does NASA study the ocean?

   Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total
   Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on
   the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing
   changes in the world's climate and weather. Collecting and analyzing
   long-term ocean data from satellites is a relatively new field of
   exploration. The analysis of remotely-sensed ocean data makes it
   possible to understand the ocean in new and exciting ways.

   Prior to satellite data, most of what we have learned about the oceans
   had come from infrequent measurements collected from ships, buoys, and
   drifters. Ship-based oceanographers are limited to sampling the ocean
   in a relatively small area with often a great deal of difficulty. Data
   from ships, buoys, and drifters are not sufficient to characterize the
   conditions of the spatially diverse of the ocean.
   The advent of ocean-observing satellites has launched a new era of
   marine discovery. Remotely sensed satellite data and modeling
   techniques enable the global mapping of seasonal changes in ocean
   surface topography, currents, waves, winds, phytoplankton content,
   sea-ice extent, rainfall, sunlight reaching the sea, and sea surface
   temperature. Studying these patterns at a global scale help forecast
   and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought. Images
   generated by ocean observing satellite missions tell us volumes about
   the most fundamental climate changes. During the last decade,
   forecasting models have benefited from satellite data as they have
   improved the ability to predict events such as El Niño and other global
   and regional climate cycles. These models will become more
   sophisticated as scientists and forecasters further develop the ability
   to simulate certain ocean phenomena and thus better predict when they
   will occur.
   Using remote sensing data and computer models, scientists can now
   investigate how the oceans affect the evolution of weather, hurricanes,
   and climate. Oceans control the Earth's weather as they heat and cool,
   humidify and dry the air and control wind speed and direction. And the
   weather determines not just what you'll wear to work in the week
   ahead--but also whether the wheat crop in Nebraska will get enough rain
   to mature, whether the snow pack in the Sierras will be thick enough to
   water southern California, whether the hurricane season in the Atlantic
   will be mellow or brutal, whether eastern Pacific fisheries will be
   decimated by El Niño. Long-term weather patterns influence water
   supply, food supply, trade shipments, and property values. They can
   even foster the growth of civilizations, or kill them off. You can't
   escape the weather, or even change it--but being able to predict its
   caprice makes its impact manageable. And only by understanding the
   dynamics of the oceans can we begin to do this.
   NASA has been observing the oceans from space for more than 20 years.
   NASA launched Seasat, the first civilian oceanographic satellite, on
   June 28, 1978. The satellite carried five complementary sensors
   designed to monitor the oceans from space. These sensors included:
     * a radar altimeter to measure spacecraft height above the ocean
       surface
     * a microwave scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction
     * a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer to measure sea surface
       temperature
     * a visible and infrared radiometer to identify cloud, land and water
       features
     * a synthetic aperture radar to monitor the global surface wave field
       and polar sea ice conditions

   Although a massive short-circuit in its power system ended all
   data-taking operations after only 105 days, the Seasat instruments
   provided as much oceanographic data as had been acquired by ships in
   the previous 100 years! The variables that Seasat measured in its short
   lifetime are some of the most important for understanding the ocean and
   its role in climate.
   Another satellite, Tiros-N, was also launched in 1978. It carried the
   first AVHRR sensor which produced the first really useful maps of
   sea-surface temperature, and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, that
   produced the first maps of chlorophyll and primary productivity in the
   ocean.
   Today there are several ocean-observing satellite missions and an
   extensive scientific research community studying these data. Each
   mission provides its own unique contribution to our knowledge of the
   ocean, however our understanding is rapidly evolving such that we are
   coming to more fully understand the role that each parameter plays in
   the constantly changing conditions and cycles of the ocean and thus on
   climate and weather.

Ocean Exploration at NASA

   NASA is the exploration agency of the Federal Government. NASA Earth
   observing satellites often open up new vistas for Earth science
   research. All are meant to explore the envelope of what is known and
   understood about the physical, chemical and biological processes of the
   planet. Learn more about Ocean Exploration at NASA.

What Happened to all the Snow?

   Play ScienceCast Video Join Mailing List

   Jan. 19, 2012: Winter seems to have been on hold this year in some
   parts of the United States. Snowfall has been scarce so far in places
   that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year.
   Missing Snow (bare dirt, 200px)
   California dog driver Tony Phillips poses with his new sled near
   Mammoth Mountain. In winter 2011 this spot was covered by several feet
   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.

What Happened to all the Snow?

   Play ScienceCast Video Join Mailing List

   Jan. 19, 2012: Winter seems to have been on hold this year in some
   parts of the United States. Snowfall has been scarce so far in places
   that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year.

   California dog driver Tony Phillips poses with his new sled near
   Mammoth Mountain. In winter 2011 this spot was covered by several feet
   of snow; in 2012 it is bare dirt. [video]

   Here's a prime example. "The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras
   of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December," says
   NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "This
   December they got less than 10 inches."

   Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records
   broken in the first five days of January in the US.

   "It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th]," says
   Patzert. "Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA
   than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even
   in the Dakotas lately."

   On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked
   departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in
   Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date.

   What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the
   Arctic Oscillation.

   First of all," he explains, "we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of
   sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet
   stream and the cold arctic air northward."

   "On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger."

   The Arctic Oscillation is a see-sawing pressure difference between the
   Arctic and lower latitudes.  When the pressure difference is high, a
   whirlpool of air forms around the North Pole. Last year, the whirlpool
   motion was weaker, allowing cold air to escape from the polar regions
   and head southward to the US.

   "This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold
   air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña
   impact."

   While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow
   away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra
   snow to places inside the whirlpool.

   "The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north," says Patzert.
   "Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska."

   Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has
   been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far
   this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane "snow
   canyons," and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents
   dig out.

   Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white
   stuff. But they'd like some.

   "Be patient," advises Patzert. "We haven't gotten to the heart of
   winter. Hold off on selling the new dogsled. There's plenty of time for
   snow. It ain't over till the Siberian Huskies sing."

   So far in the winter of 2011-2012, the "AO Index" has been mostly
   positive, signaling a strong Arctic Oscillation. "Compare this to

   and you can see the difference between the two winters," notes Patzert.
