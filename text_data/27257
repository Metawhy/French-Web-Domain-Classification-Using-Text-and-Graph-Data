Executive Summary

   Incineration is widely used to reduce the volume of municipal solid
   waste, to reduce the potential infectious properties and volume of
   medical waste, and to reduce the potential toxicity and volume of
   hazardous chemical and biological waste. In the United States, more
   than 100 facilities incinerate municipal solid waste, and more than
   1,600 facilities incinerate medical waste. Also, almost 200
   incinerators and industrial kiln facilities, and many industrial
   boilers and furnaces combust hazardous and nonhazardous waste.

   Whether incineration is an appropriate means of managing waste has been
   the subject of much debate in this country. A major aspect of the
   debate is the potential risk to human health that might result from the
   emission of pollutants generated by the incineration process; some of
   those pollutants have been found to cause various adverse health
   effects. Although such effects have generally been observed at much
   higher ambient concentrations than those usually produced by emissions
   from an incineration facility, questions persist about the possible
   effects of smaller amounts of pollutants from incineration facilities,
   especially when combined with the mix of pollutants emitted from other
   sources. The possible social, economic, and psychologic effects
   associated with living or working near an incineration facility also
   have been topics of concern.

   This report was prepared by the National Research Council's Committee
   on Health Effects of Waste Incineration. The committee was formed to
   assess relationships between waste incineration and human health and to
   consider specific issues related to the incineration of hazardous
   waste, municipal solid waste, and medical waste. The committee was
   asked to consider various design, siting, and operating conditions at
   waste-incineration facilities with respect to releases

   of potentially harmful pollutants to the environment. It was also asked
   to consider appropriate health-based approaches for demonstrating that
   an incineration facility meets and maintains established levels of
   health protection. Issues related to communication of information on
   waste incineration were also within the study charge. The committee was
   asked to consider types of information that should be provided to
   government officials, industry managers, and the general public to help
   them in future efforts to understand and weigh the risks associated
   with waste incineration and its alternatives. Finally, the committee
   was asked to consider factors that might affect public perceptions of
   waste incineration.

   The committee was not charged to assess risks posed by any particular
   waste-incineration facility or to compare the risks of incineration
   with risks posed by various waste-management alternatives, such as
   landfilling. The committee focused its attention on wastes that have
   reached an incineration facility—it was not asked to address the
   collection or storage of wastes at, or their transportation to, any
   incineration facility; nor was it asked to consider treatment of
   residual ash away from a facility.

WASTE-INCINERATION PROCESSES AND EMISSIONS

   The principal gaseous products of waste incineration, like other
   combustion processes, are carbon dioxide and water vapor. And, like
   many combustion processes, incineration also produces byproducts such
   as soot particles and other contaminants released in exhaust gases, and
   leaves a residue (bottom ash) of incombustible and partially combusted
   waste that must be emptied from incinerator chambers and properly
   disposed. The composition of the gas and ash byproducts is determined,
   at least in part, by the composition of the wastes fed into an
   incineration facility. This feedstream composition can be altered by
   other waste-management activities, such as reducing the amount of waste
   generated, reusing materials, and recycling waste materials for use as
   feedstocks for various manufacturing processes.

   The exhaust gases from waste incineration facilities may contain many
   potentially harmful substances, including particulate matter; oxides of
   nitrogen; oxides of sulfur; carbon monoxide; dioxins and furans;
   metals, such as lead and mercury; acid gases; volatile chlorinated
   organic compounds; and polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some pollutant
   emissions are formed, in part, by incomplete combustion that may in
   turn lead to the formation of pollutants such as dioxins and furans.
   The formation of products of incomplete combustion is governed by the
   duration of the combustion process, the extent of gas mixing in the
   combustion chamber, and the temperature of combustion. Good combustion
   efficiency depends upon maintaining the appropriate temperature,
   residence time, and turbulence in the incineration process. Optimal
   conditions in a combustion chamber must be maintained so that the gases
   rising from the chamber mix thoroughly and continuously with injected
   air; maintaining the optimal tempera-

   ture range involves burning of fuel in an auxiliary burner during
   startup, shutdown, and process upsets. The combustion chamber is
   designed to provide adequate turbulence and residence time of the
   combustion gases.

   Operation of the incinerator also affects the emission of heavy metals,
   chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen that may be present in the waste fed
   into the incinerator. Such chemicals are not destroyed during
   combustion, but are distributed among the bottom ash, fly ash, and
   released gases in proportions that depend on the characteristics of the
   metal and the combustion conditions. Mercury and its compounds, for
   example, are volatile, so most of the mercury in the waste feed is
   vaporized in the combustion chamber. In the cases of lead and cadmium,
   the distributions between the bottom ash and fly ash depend on
   operating conditions. At higher combustion-chamber temperatures, more
   of the metals can appear in the fly ash or gaseous emissions.
   Therefore, combustion conditions need to maximize the destruction of
   products of incomplete combustion and to minimize the vaporization and
   entrainment of heavy metals, especially when adequate control of
   emissions is lacking. Formation of oxides of nitrogen is promoted by
   high temperatures and the presence of nitrogen-containing wastes.

   In addition, air-pollution control devices can greatly influence
   emissions from waste-incineration facilities. For example, airborne
   particles can be controlled with electrostatic precipitators, fabric
   filters, or wet scrubbers. Hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, dioxins,
   and heavy metals can be controlled with wet scrubbers, spray-dryer
   absorbers, or dry-sorbent injection and fabric filters. Oxides of
   nitrogen can be controlled, in part, by combustion-process modification
   and ammonia or urea injection through selective catalytic or
   noncatalytic reduction. Concentrations of dioxins and mercury can be
   reduced substantially by passing the cooled flue gas through a carbon
   sorbent bed or by injecting activated carbon into the flue gas.

   With current technology, waste incinerators can be designed and
   operated to produce nearly complete combustion of the combustible
   portion of waste and to emit low amounts of the pollutants of concern
   under normal operating conditions. In addition, using well-trained
   employees can help ensure that an incinerator is operated to its
   maximal combustion efficiency and that the emission-control devices are
   operated optimally for pollutant capture or neutralization. However,
   for all types of incinerators, there is a need to be alert to
   off-normal (upset) conditions that might result in short-term emissions
   greater than those usually represented by typical operating conditions
   or by annual national averages. Such upset conditions usually occur
   during incinerator startup or shutdown or when the composition of the
   waste being burned changes sharply. Upset conditions can also be caused
   by malfunctioning equipment, operator error, poor management of the
   incineration process, or inadequate maintenance.

   Typically, emissions data have been collected from incineration
   facilities during only a small fraction of the total number of
   incinerator operating hours and generally do not include data during
   startup, shutdown, and upset condi-

   tions. Furthermore, such data are typically based on a few stack
   samples for each pollutant. The adequacy of such emissions data to
   characterize fully the contribution of incineration to ambient
   pollutant concentrations for health-effects assessments is uncertain.
   More emissions information is needed, especially for dioxins and
   furans, heavy metals, and particulate matter.

Recommendations

   Government agencies should continue to improve—or in some cases should
   begin—the process of collecting, and making readily available to the
   public, substantially more information on the following:
     * The effects of design and operating conditions on emissions and
       ash. Such information should show how specific emissions and ash
       characteristics are affected by modifying the operating conditions
       of an incinerator to maximize its combustion efficiency. It should
       also indicate the types and combinations of operating conditions
       that optimize the effectiveness of emission-control devices.
     * New combustor designs; continuous emission monitors;
       emissions-control technologies; operating practices; and techniques
       for source reduction, fuel cleaning, and fuel preparation,
       including records of demonstrated environmental performance and
       effects on emissions and ash.
     * Emission and process conditions during startup, shutdown, and upset
       conditions. Emissions testing has usually been performed under
       relatively steady-state conditions. However, the greatest emissions
       are expected to occur during startup, shutdown, and malfunctions.
       Such emissions need to be better characterized with respect to
       possible health effects. Therefore, data are needed on the level of
       emissions, the frequency of accidents and other off-normal
       performance, and the reasons for such occurrences.

ENVIRONMENTAL PATHWAYS OF HUMAN EXPOSURE

   After pollutants from an incineration facility disperse into the air,
   some people close to the facility may be exposed directly through
   inhalation or indirectly through consumption of food or water
   contaminated by deposition of the pollutants from air to soil,
   vegetation, and water. For metals and other pollutants that are very
   persistent in the environment, the potential effects may extend well
   beyond the area close to the incinerator. Persistent pollutants can be
   carried long distances from their emission sources, go through various
   chemical and physical transformations, and pass numerous times through
   soil, water, or food.

   Dioxins, furans, and mercury are examples of persistent pollutants for
   which incinerators have contributed a substantial portion of the total
   national emis-

   sions. Whereas one incinerator might contribute only a small fraction
   of the total environmental concentrations of these chemicals, the sum
   of the emissions of all the incineration facilities in a region can be
   considerable. Many older incinerators have been closed down and
   replaced by modern low-emitting units, so the relative contribution of
   incineration to the current concentrations of chemicals in the
   environment is uncertain.

   Results of environmental monitoring studies around incineration
   facilities have indicated that the specific facilities studied were not
   likely to be major contributors to local ambient concentrations of the
   substances of concern, although there are exceptions. However,
   methodological limitations of those studies do not permit general
   conclusions to be drawn about the overall contributions of waste
   incineration to environmental concentrations of those contaminants.

   Although emissions from incineration facilities can be smaller than
   emissions from other types of sources, it is important to assess
   incinerator emissions in the context of the total ambient concentration
   of pollutants in an area. In areas where the ambient concentrations are
   already close to or above environmental guidelines or standards, even
   relatively small increments can be important.

   Computational models for the environmental transport and fate of
   contaminants through air, soil, water, and food can provide useful
   information for assessing major exposure pathways for humans, but, in
   general, they are not accurate enough to provide estimates of overall
   environmental contributions from an individual facility within a factor
   of 10. The models suggest that fish consumption is the major pathway of
   human exposure to mercury, and that meats, dairy products, and fish are
   potentially the major exposure pathways for dioxins and furans. For
   assessment of persistent pollutants, there is usually a poor
   correlation between total ambient concentrations and local emissions
   from an incinerator.

Recommendations

     * Environmental assessment and management strategies for emissions
       from individual incineration facilities should include a
       regional-scale framework for assessing dispersion, persistence, and
       potential long-term impacts on human health.
     * Better material balance information—including measurements of
       source emissions to air and deposition rates to soil, water, and
       vegetation—are needed to determine the contribution of
       waste-incineration facilities to environmental concentrations of
       persistent chemicals. The variation of these emissions over time
       needs to be taken into account: for the short term to determine if
       any important emission increases occur at an incineration facility,
       and for the long term to measure changes due to the replacement of
       less-efficient incinerators with modern, lower-emitting units.

     * To facilitate evaluation of the overall contributions of
       incinerators to pollutants in the environment, estimates of
       dispersion of incinerator emissions into the environment should be
       gathered. The additional information would allow conversion of
       emissions estimates into environmental concentration estimates.
     * Government agencies should link emissions and facility-specific
       data from all incineration facilities to characterize better the
       contributions of incinerators to environmental concentrations.
       Existing databases should be linked to provide easy access to
       specific operating conditions of an incinerator, height and
       diameter of the emission stack, flow rate and temperature of the
       gases leaving the stack, local meteorological conditions,
       air-dispersion coefficients as a function of distance from a
       facility, and precise geographic location of the emission point.
       Data should be standardized for uniform reporting.

HEALTH EFFECTS

   Few epidemiologic studies have attempted to assess whether adverse
   health effects have actually occurred near individual incinerators, and
   most of them have been unable to detect any effects. The studies of
   which the committee is aware that did report finding health effects had
   shortcomings and failed to provide convincing evidence. That result is
   not surprising given the small populations typically available for
   study and the fact that such effects, if any, might occur only
   infrequently or take many years to appear. Also, factors such as
   emissions from other pollution sources and variations in human activity
   patterns often decrease the likelihood of determining a relationship
   between small contributions of pollutants from incinerators and
   observed health effects. Lack of evidence of such relationships might
   mean that adverse health effects did not occur, but it could also mean
   that such relationships might not be detectable using available methods
   and data sources.

   Pollutants emitted by incinerators that appear to have the potential to
   cause the largest health effects are particulate matter, lead, mercury,
   and dioxins and furans. However, there is wide variation in the
   contributions that incinerators can make to environmental
   concentrations of those contaminants. Although emissions from newer,
   well-run facilities are expected to contribute little to environmental
   concentrations and to health risks, the same might not be true for some
   older or poorly run facilities.

   Studies of workers at municipal solid-waste incinerators show that
   workers are at much higher risk for adverse health effects than
   individual residents in the surrounding area. In the past, incinerator
   workers have been exposed to high concentrations of dioxins and toxic
   metals, particularly lead, cadmium, and mercury.

Recommendations

     * To increase the power of epidemiologic studies to assess the health
       effects of incinerators, future multi-site studies should be
       designed to evaluate combined data from all facilities in a local
       area as well as multiple localities that contain similar
       incinerators and incinerator workers, rather than examining health
       issues separately site by site.
     * In addition to using other exposure-assessment techniques, worker
       exposures should be evaluated comprehensively through biological
       monitoring, particularly in combination with efforts to reduce
       exposures of workers during maintenance operations.
     * Assessments of health risks attributable to waste incineration
       should pay special attention to the risks that might be posed by
       particulate matter, lead, mercury, dioxins and furans.
     * Health risks attributable to emissions resulting from incinerator
       upset conditions need to be evaluated. Data are needed on the
       levels of emissions during process upsets as well as the frequency,
       severity, and causes of accidents and other off-specification
       performance to enable adequate risk assessments related to these
       factors. Such information is needed to address whether off-normal
       emissions are important with respect to possible health effects.
     * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational
       Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should continue striving to
       improve coordination of enforcement activities between the two
       agencies to protect the health of incineration workers.

REGULATION OF WASTE-INCINERATION FACILITIES

   Waste-incineration facilities are required to comply with a combination
   of federal, state, and local regulations that vary from place to place
   and time to time. EPA has proposed or has promulgated separate
   regulations for incineration of medical, hazardous, and municipal solid
   wastes to reduce emissions to values achieved by the best-controlled
   12% of incinerators. This standard is known as “maximum achievable
   control technology,” or MACT. Facilities that meet the MACT
   requirements are generally expected to have substantially lower
   emissions. The intended reduction in emissions would lower exposures
   and possible risks to populations surrounding incinerators, especially
   for particulate matter, lead, mercury, and other metals. However, the
   effects of such regulations are less apparent when emissions of the
   most-important pollutants from all incineration sources are considered
   on a regional scale. For example, the collective contribution of
   dioxins from multiple incineration sources might remain problematic
   despite MACT regulations. Because the collective effects of incin-

   erators on metropolitan or regional scales are largely unknown, it is
   uncertain whether implementation of MACT standards for incinerators
   will substantially reduce the actual risks posed by persistent
   environmental pollutants at those scales.

   Based on estimates of incinerator emissions, environmental transport
   and fate, potential total exposure, and relative toxicity of the
   individual substances inferred from studies not involving incineration,
   the committee concludes
     * Compliance with MACT regulations is expected to reduce
       substantially local population exposures, especially for
       particulate matter, lead, mercury and other metals, acidic gases,
       and acidic aerosols.
     * Substantial concerns about regional dioxin and furan exposures and
       moderate concerns about regional exposures to metals are not
       expected to be relieved by MACT regulations, because the
       regulations may not adequately reduce risks attributable to
       cumulative emissions on a regional basis.
     * Substantial concerns about workers' exposures to particulate
       matter, lead, mercury, and dioxins and furans are not expected to
       be relieved by MACT compliance, because those regulations were not
       designed to affect workers' exposures.

Recommendations

     * Technologies used in other countries for combustion, emission
       control, continuous emission monitoring, and public dissemination
       of information, as well as optimum operating practices, should be
       actively studied and considered for adoption in the United States.
     * All regulated medical-waste incinerators and municipal solid-waste
       combustors should have uniform limits for each pollutant,
       irrespective of plant size, design, age, or feedstock, as is the
       case for hazardous-waste combustors. The same technology for
       air-pollution control is applicable to small and large facilities.
       Allowing less-stringent limitations for some designs or sizes is
       inconsistent with the principle of minimizing risks of health
       effects.
     * Government agencies should encourage research, development, and
       demonstration of continuous emission monitors (CEMs), dissemination
       technologies, and computer programs that automatically analyze,
       summarize, and report CEM data. In addition to the CEMs already
       required in municipal solid waste incinerator rules, requirement of
       CEMs for hydrochloric acid and particulate-matter should be
       considered on such incinerators. Also, as soon as a mercury monitor
       that measures ionic and metallic forms of mercury emissions has
       been proven reliable, EPA should consider its use for domestic
       incinerators. The same approach should be used for

          other monitors, including those for other heavy metals and
          dioxins and furans. EPA should also explore the utility of
          technologies such as direct electronic transmission and display
          to disseminate CEM data to regulatory authorities and the
          public. Providing such data and data summaries on the Internet
          should be considered.

     * In future regulatory decision-making, greater consideration should
       be given to emission levels achieved in actual performance of
       incinerators, including process upset conditions (described
       earlier). In monitoring for compliance or other purposes, data
       generated during the intervals in which a facility is in startup,
       shutdown, and upset conditions should be included in the hourly
       emission data recorded and published. It is during those times that
       the highest emissions may occur, and omitting them systematically
       from monitoring data records does not allow for a full
       characterization of the actual emissions from an incineration
       facility.

SOCIAL ISSUES AND COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS

   In addition to possible physical-health effects, a waste-incineration
   facility may have other effects on individuals, groups, or the entire
   population in the surrounding area. The effects might be economic (such
   as job creation or decrease in property values), psychological (such as
   stress or stigma), or social (such as community factionalization or
   unity). However, there is little rigorous information on those impacts
   of waste-incineration facilities.

   Citizen concerns need to be heard and understood. Conflicts can
   increase the time and expense of conducting waste incinerators and
   other facilities that might be potentially beneficial to society.
   Opposition to the facilities also can indicate that important concerns
   are not being addressed adequately.

   Much public opposition to waste incineration might be due to a lack of
   understanding of the relative health risks posed by incineration in
   comparison with other waste-management methods. But health is not the
   only issue, and the differences between expert and public perceptions
   are not due merely to differences in information and understanding;
   they can also be due to differences in social values. People's
   perceptions are often extraordinarily resistant to change, in part
   because they reflect underlying values. Efforts that ignore or try to
   change these perceptions radically are likely to fail. Risk
   communication should accept as legitimate the perceptions and concerns
   of various members of the public and involve them in consultative,
   participatory processes. Not only do members of the public have a right
   and responsibility to be involved in the assessment and management of
   hazards in their communities, but such involvement might result in
   improved assessments and management strategies.

   Developing effective participatory programs is very difficult, but some
   general principles are beginning to emerge. The process of public
   involvement should be open, inclusive, and substantive, and members of
   the public in an

   affected area should be involved early and often. Major concerns are
   likely to include issues of safety, compensation, and local oversight
   and control. Satisfying the public's need for information on
   incinerator safety requires continual assessment and demonstration of
   regulatory compliance with existing standards.

Recommendations

     * The social, psychological, and economic effects of proposed and
       existing waste incineration facilities should be assessed, and
       mitigation of or compensation for such effects should be considered
       where appropriate.
     * The boundaries of an area potentially affected by a waste
       incinerator should not be defined at the outset by a particular
       community's political boundaries or jurisdiction. Instead, the
       assessment area should be based on the geographic extent over which
       various effects could reasonably occur. Such an approach permits a
       more-accurate analysis of the impacts. It also permits a better
       understanding of problems that might arise in connection with
       information exchange among all persons involved with, or affected
       by, decision-making concerning the facility.
     * Proponents of an incineration facility should assume, in dealing
       with local communities, that they (the proponents) should make the
       case for a new or expanded facility, especially if a waste
       combustor is not used solely within a manufacturing facility to
       incinerate waste on site.
     * If a new or expanded facility is contemplated, local citizens might
       consider conducting their own assessments of the proposed facility
       and its effects through various approaches, including, for example,
       hiring independent consultants that members of the community trust,
       seeking technical-assistance grants from the government, or finding
       technical advisers who are acceptable to both sides.
     * Particular attention should be paid to equity issues when a
       facility is to be placed in a community that is already
       experiencing disproportionate health, environmental, or
       socioeconomic burdens.
     * Government agencies should improve—or in some cases begin—to
       collect and make readily available, information on site-specific
       and large-scale empirical research on possible socioeconomic
       impacts of waste-incineration facilities on their host areas. To
       the extent practicable, efforts should be expanded to gather such
       information routinely before and during operation of incineration
       facilities that have the potential to have more than a minor
       socioeconomic impact.

UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY

   Incineration facilities vary with regard to types of waste incinerated,
   operating practices, allowable magnitudes of emission, emission-control
   technologies,

   types of substances emitted, environmental conditions, proximity to
   other sources of contaminants, and frequency of process upsets. The
   people who might be exposed to the contaminants are likely to differ in
   their susceptibilities and activity patterns. Some uncertainties are
   specific to waste incineration, and some are inherent in any activity
   that releases contaminants into the environment.

   Some of the uncertainties and variability can be reduced or better
   accounted for; others will remain intractable. The most-effective
   decisions concerning the siting, design, operation, and regulation of
   incineration facilities are the ones that take uncertainty and
   variability fully into account.

Recommendations

     * Incinerator risk assessments should include the following
       components of uncertainty and variability analyses
          + An estimate of the variability and uncertainty distributions
            of all input values and their effects on final estimates.
          + A sensitivity analysis to assess how model predictions are
            related to variations in input data.
          + Variance-propagation models that show how the variability and
            uncertainty of final results are tied to the uncertainties and
            variabilities associated with the various models, their
            inputs, and assumptions used throughout the risk assessment.

   The committee's evaluation of waste incineration and public health was
   substantially impaired by the lack of available compilations of the
   ambient concentrations of pollutants resulting from incinerator
   emissions. In addition, large variabilities and uncertainties
   associated with risk-assessment predictions often limit the ability to
   define risks posed by incinerators.

   Incineration has been used widely for waste disposal, including
   household, hazardous, and medical waste--but there is increasing public
   concern over the benefits of combusting the waste versus the health
   risk from pollutants emitted during combustion. Waste Incineration and
   Public Health informs the emerging debate with the most up-to-date
   information available on incineration, pollution, and human
   health--along with expert conclusions and recommendations for further
   research and improvement of such areas as risk communication. The
   committee provides details on:
     * Processes involved in incineration and how contaminants are
       released.
     * Environmental dynamics of contaminants and routes of human
       exposure.
     * Tools and approaches for assessing possible human health effects.
     * Scientific concerns pertinent to future regulatory actions.

   The book also examines some of the social, psychological, and economic
   factors that affect the communities where incineration takes place and
   addresses the problem of uncertainty and variation in predicting the
   health effects of incineration processes.

INTRODUCTION

   Mexico is among many countries that have experienced a rapid increase
   over the past two decades in the proportion of children and adolescents
   with excessive weight. In the decade between the First (1988) and
   Second (1999) National Nutrition Surveys, there was an increase in the
   prevalence of Mexican children ages 2–4 years who were either obese or
   at risk for obesity,^1 rising from 21.9 percent to 28.7 percent. This
   is the only age group in children for which national trend data are
   available. For older Mexican children, the lack of national trend data
   limits the evaluation of obesity trends during that decade. However,
   data from the Second National Nutrition Survey show equally alarming
   evidence of a growing obesity epidemic in children and youth. Based on
   the age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) charts developed by
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2000
   (Kuczmarski et al., 2000), 21.1 percent of Mexican children ages 6–11
   years have a BMI equal to or greater than the 85th percentile and are
   considered to be obese (8.8 percent) or at risk for obesity (12.3
   percent). Among girls ages 12–19 years, 22.3 percent have a BMI

   ^1

   At risk for obesity and obesity are defined as having a BMI equal to or
   greater than the 85th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of the age-
   and gender-specific BMI charts developed by the CDC in 2000 (Kuczmarski
   et al., 2000).

   equal to or greater than the 85th percentile and are either obese (5.7
   percent) or at risk for obesity (16.6 percent).

   These data reflect an evolving obesity epidemic, representing an
   enormous burden for the public health and health care systems in
   Mexico. The association between childhood obesity and many health
   risks, in both children and adults, has been consistently found. The
   major public health impact is the association of childhood obesity with
   chronic disease risks in adulthood, especially overweight and obesity,
   type 2 diabetes, hypertension, asthma, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular
   diseases (CVD), and certain cancers. Excessive weight at younger ages
   has also been associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes such as low
   self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function,
   especially in adolescents, although findings have not always been
   consistent (Swallen et al., 2005). However, research is currently not
   available to demonstrate this association in Mexican children and
   youth.

   Nutrition-related chronic diseases represent a serious public health
   problem for the Mexican population. According to the Organization for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2005 Health Report, one
   quarter (24.2 percent) of the Mexican adult population is classified as
   obese (OECD, 2005). Data from the most recent National Health Survey
   (2000) showed that nearly 8 percent of all Mexican adults over 20 years
   of age have type 2 diabetes and approximately 30 percent have
   hypertension (Olaiz et al., 2003). Moreover, type 2 diabetes and CVD
   are the leading causes of death in the adult Mexican population, and
   some small studies suggest an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes
   and glucose intolerance at younger ages (Cruz et al., 2004;
   Rodríguez-Moran et al., 2004).

   Although there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of the economic
   impact of obesity in Mexico, a recent analysis estimated an
   attributable cost of diabetes for the public health sector of
   approximately $317 million U.S. dollars for the year 2005, almost
   equally distributed between direct and indirect costs (Arredondo and
   Zuñiga, 2004). The increasing incidence of obesity at younger ages and
   the scarce public resources in the country will considerably aggravate
   these economic projections.

   As in many developing countries, the Mexican population is in the

   disease burden. Child mortality rates and the incidence of infectious
   diseases have decreased. However, statistics show a significant
   increase in obesity and related chronic diseases such as diabetes,
   hypertension, and CVD in adults. High rates of malnutrition and related
   problems are still observed, especially among sub-populations of
   Mexican children. This paradoxical situation is the result of multiple
   factors, partly attributed to the uneven development among different
   segments of the population and increased socioeconomic inequalities

   enon that the Mexican population has experienced over the past few
   decades is a nutritional transition, that is a shift in the overall
   structure of dietary patterns and a reduction in energy expenditure.
   This transition is affecting most of the population, and has been
   proposed that it is the main driving force of the obesity epidemic and
   related chronic conditions in developing countries (Popkin, 2001).

   Given the concern over the growing prevalence of obesity and its
   impact, the U.S. Congress directed the CDC in 2002 to request that the
   Institute of Medicine (IOM) develop an action plan targeted to prevent
   obesity in U.S. children and youth. The IOM convened a
   multidisciplinary committee to develop a prevention-focused action
   plan. In 2004, the committee released the report Preventing Childhood
   Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005), which proposed a set of
   recommendations for a variety of sectors and stakeholders that, when
   implemented together, would catalyze synergistic actions to effectively
   prevent the large majority of children and youth in the United States
   from becoming obese and facilitate the adoption of healthier
   lifestyles. By making childhood obesity a national priority, this set
   of recommendations calls on coordinated actions among the government,
   industry, media, community organizations, schools, and families that
   together will develop a broad-based public health strategy needed to
   effectively halt and decrease this growing epidemic (IOM, 2005).

   Are these recommendations applicable to Mexican–American and Mexican
   children and youth? Are these recommendations applicable to the
   particular public health challenges faced by Mexico? Is there any
   benefit to developing a common binational obesity prevention agenda or
   strategy? These are the main questions that stimulated the IOM to
   sponsor a joint U.S.–Mexico workshop—in collaboration with the National
   Institute of Public Health in Mexico (INSP) and supported by Kaiser
   Permanente—that will focus on exploring a binational approach to
   obesity prevention and the adaptation of the IOM report recommendations
   to Mexican children and youth living in the United States and in
   Mexico. The purpose of this paper is to review the factors that
   contribute to obesity in Mexican children and adolescents, provide an
   overview of current programs addressing this problem, and propose a set
   of actions that may offer the greatest potential for success in
   preventing and controlling the epidemic. A companion paper, authored by
   U.S. colleagues, will address obesity trends and determinants in
   Mexican–American children and youth (Trowbridge and Mendoza, 2007) and
   provide a complementary view to the issues presented in this paper.

   Based on an ecologic perspective, several components and their degrees
   of influence are context specific. For instance, the acceptance and
   understanding of “healthy behavior” recommendations are linked closely
   to cultural values that could be specific for each ethnic group. Also,
   given that

   most of the recommendations imply actions at different normative
   levels, there are substantial differences in the legal, economic, and
   political contexts that need to be considered carefully in the use of
   the IOM report model to develop recommendations for Mexican children
   and youth living on both sides of the U.S.–Mexico border.

   Approaching obesity prevention among Mexican children and youth as a
   binational problem could have many advantages. Given the strong link
   between the population in Mexico and the one that has migrated to the
   United States, common cultural perceptions and values can be explored
   as a combined effort to design culturally acceptable recommendations
   and to define research priorities. Moreover, the permanent
   relationship, including remittances and transfer of commodities between
   U.S. migrant workers and their families, might allow the development of
   coordinated strategies that could impact not only the population living
   at the border (characterized by a high mobilization across countries)
   but also the population living in the remote areas (especially the
   rural areas) of Mexico, where most migrants trace their family roots.
   Finally, the obesity burden, on one hand, and the evidence of effective
   programs in the United States, on the other, can potentially improve
   advocacy efforts in Mexico and vice versa. Therefore, if coordination
   between countries can be fostered, progress toward effective preventive
   interventions will be accelerated with benefits and impacts on both
   sides of the U.S.–Mexico border.

DEFINING THE PROBLEM

Definition and Measurement of Obesity

   BMI, which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in
   squared meters (kg/m^2), is a useful indirect measurement of body fat
   and unhealthy weight in children ages 2 years and older and adults. It
   is often used as a screening tool to identify individuals who are obese
   and those at risk for obesity because the measurements of height and
   weight are easily obtained compared with skinfold thickness
   measurements and other complex procedures that require more training
   and standardization. BMI is one of the best indicators of body fat,
   which is proposed as the cause component of the health consequences
   associated with obesity (Mei et al., 2002). Indeed, BMI has been
   associated consistently with several risk factors, even among children
   and adolescents. Preliminary results of the association between BMI and
   chronic disease risk factors among Mexican adolescents based on the
   National Health Survey (2000) are consistent with analyses from other
   countries in which CVD risk factors show a dose–response relationship
   with BMI categories, whereby the normal-weight category shows the
   lowest risk profile and the obesity category shows the highest risk

   file (Villalpando et al., in press) (Figure B-1). BMI has certain
   disadvantages. It has been suggested that other indicators, such as
   waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or skinfold thickness
   measurements, could have a stronger association with metabolic
   abnormalities. However, these measurements are not usually obtained for
   children and youth in health clinics and school systems as readily as
   weight and height, and are usually not known by parents; thus, BMI is
   the measurement most commonly used.

   Although there may be a need to develop ethnic-specific definitions for
   overweight and obesity, the cut-off points used to define overweight (a
   BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m^2) and obesity (a BMI equal to or greater
   that 30 kg/m^2) for adults are widely accepted. However, given that BMI
   changes with children’s growth and development, it is more appropriate
   to use age-and gender-specific BMI charts to define obesity and at risk
   for obesity in children and adolescents. For consistency with the IOM
   report Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005)
   and with the companion paper examining the factors contributing to
   obesity in Mexican– American children and youth, this paper uses the
   CDC BMI charts established in 2000 to define obesity and being at-risk
   for obesity for children

   and adolescents between the ages of 2–19 years. According to this
   reference, children and adolescents with a BMI equal to or greater than
   the 95th percentile are considered obese, and those with a BMI between
   the 85th and 95th percentiles are considered to be at risk for obesity
   (IOM, 2005; Kuczmarski et al., 2000). In the absence of a reference
   population or cut-off points specific for the Mexican population, the
   authors conclude that the CDC BMI charts are the best available for
   children and adolescents 2–19 years. In the future, the recently
   released WHO Child Growth Standards, developed using data collected by
   the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study
   that provide new guidelines for assessing obesity in children ages 0–5
   years (WHO, 2006a) could also be used for that age range.

Obesity Prevalence and Trends in Children and Youth in Mexico

   The only national survey that included anthropometric measurements of
   school-aged children was the Second National Nutrition Survey (Rivera
   et al., 2001), conducted by the National Institute of Public Health of
   Mexico between October 1998 and March 1999. The Third National
   Nutrition Survey 2006 is currently in progress and will provide further
   data on obesity trends in children, youth, and adults throughout the
   entire country.

   The results of the Second National Nutrition Survey were based on a
   national probabilistic sample of 17,944 households. The sampling
   methodology and response rates are described in detail elsewhere
   (Resano-Pérez et al., 2003). The resulting sample is representative at
   the national level of urban (≥ 2,500 people) and rural (< 2,500 people)
   sites and of four geographic regions: north (the wealthiest region),
   south (the poorest region), Mexico City [a large urban center with the
   greatest socioeconomic status (SES) contrasts], and central (including
   states that are generally between the north and the south with respect
   to SES). The study population included children younger than 5 years of
   age (n = 8,011), school-aged children ages 5–11 years (n = 11,415), and
   women ages 12–49 years (n = 18,311). The sample represented about 10.6
   million children 4 years of age or younger and 15.6 million children
   ages 5–11 years. In addition to these age ranges, which were employed
   in the First and Second Mexican National Nutrition Survey and are used
   in previous publications, for consistency with the IOM report (IOM,
   2005) and the companion paper on Mexican–American children, we computed
   prevalences for the following age ranges (Table B-1): 0–23 months, 2–5
   years, 6–11 years, and 12–19 years. However, some of the results
   presented in this document use the age ranges employed by the National
   Nutrition Surveys because we obtained them from published material.

   The national prevalence of children at risk for obesity and obese by
   age, geographic region, and sociodemographic characteristics derived
   from the National Nutrition Survey 1999 are illustrated in Table B-1.
   In infants younger than 2 years, the national prevalence of children at
   risk for obesity [defined as the percent > +2 SD of the WHO/National
   Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/CDC reference population] is 5.84
   percent. For children ages 2–5 years, the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥
   95th percentile of the age-and gender-specific CDC BMI charts) was 10.4
   percent, and the prevalence of children at risk for obesity (BMI
   between the 85th and 95th percentile of the CDC BMI charts) was 17.1
   percent for a total of 27.5 percent of children in this age category
   who are either at risk or obese. Both groups present higher prevalence
   in the north compared with the other regions, and for 2– 5-year-olds,
   the prevalence was higher in urban versus rural areas and in high
   versus low SES strata.

   The only age category for which there are available data from two
   national surveys (1988 and 1999), allowing for an evaluation of obesity
   trends, is children younger than 5 years of age. Figure B-2 shows the
   trend in the proportion of children ages 2–4 years that were over the
   85th percentile of the reference population. An increase was evident at
   the national level (31 percent, from 21.9 percent to 28.7 percent) and
   in each of the four regions represented in the survey; this increase
   was especially notable in the north (with the highest SES), which
   showed an estimated increase over 50 percent (from 20.8 percent to 31.8
   percent) in the prevalence of obesity or at risk for obesity (> 85th
   percentile) over the 11-year period. This increment was mainly driven
   by the proportion of children who were at risk for obesity rather than
   the obesity category.

   Among Mexican children ages 6–11 years, 8.8 percent were classified as
   obese (> 95th percentile) and 12.3 percent were classified as at risk
   for obesity (> 85th percentile) at the national level. The magnitude of
   the regional prevalence followed the children’s SES status. The highest
   prevalence of obesity was found in the north (12.7 percent), followed
   by Mexico City (11.4 percent), the central region (8.8 percent), and
   the south (5.5 percent). The prevalence was higher in those living in
   urban (11 percent) versus rural areas (3.4 percent), in children whose
   mothers had a higher level of formal education (e.g., more than high
   school = 13.2 percent, high school = 11.8 percent, primary school = 7.5
   percent, without formal education = 4.8 percent), and in the
   non-indigenous population (9.4 percent versus 3.4 percent). The
   prevalence of children at risk of obesity was higher than for the
   obesity category following the same pattern. The relatively larger
   prevalence of unhealthy weight in wealthier subpopulations is in
   contrast with the very small differences in prevalence of unhealthy
   weight found among the same subpopulations for adult women (Rivera et
   al., 2002).

Undernutrition and Catch-Up Growth in Children and Youth in Mexico

   The coexistence of under- and overnutrition is a characteristic of the
   Mexican population, particularly among children and young women. Along
   with the high prevalence of unhealthy weight in children, the
   prevalence of stunting ,^2 anemia, and micronutrient deficiencies
   remain public health concerns. Stunting continues to be an important
   public health problem in children younger than 5 years of age while
   wasting^3 is no longer a widespread problem, decreasing from a national
   prevalence of 6 percent in 1988 to a prevalence of 2 percent in 1999.
   At the national level, stunting occurred in almost one of every five
   children younger than 5 years of age (17.7 percent) while wasting
   occurred in only 2 percent. The mean height-for-age z-score in this age
   group was −0.8 ± 1.3 while the mean weight-for-height z-score was +0.2
   ± 1.1. Stunting occurs predominantly during the first two years of
   life. The prevalence increases almost threefold between the first and
   the second years of life (from about 8 percent to 22 percent) and
   remains at about 20 percent up to 4 years of age. From 5–11 years, the
   percent of

   ^2

   Stunting is defined as low height for age (< 2 SD of the WHO/NCHS/CDC
   reference population).

   ^3

   Wasting is defined as low weight for age (< 2 SD of the WHO/NCHS/CDC
   reference population).

   stunting in children was 16.1 percent, which is mainly the result of
   stunting during early childhood. The long-term effects of stunting on
   height are evident in the adult population. On average, Mexican adult
   women are short (e.g., the mean height of women 12–49 years of age is
   152.9 cm).

   Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in most age groups
   (Villalpando et al., 2003a, b, c). More than one in every four children
   younger than 5 years (27.2 percent) are anemic, and between one-quarter
   to one-half have one or more micronutrient deficiencies. The prevalence
   of iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiencies are at approximately 52
   percent, 33 percent, and 27 percent, respectively. Additionally, more
   than 25 percent of children have serum ascorbic acid concentrations
   indicative of low dietary intake of vitamin C. Some micronutrient
   deficiencies occur predominantly at younger ages. Anemia rates peak in
   the second year of life, when almost half of all children are affected,
   but decrease to about 17 percent prevalence at 4 years of age. Iron
   deficiency affects about two-thirds of all children between 1 and 2
   years of age and less than 50 percent between 3 and 4 years of age.

   The prevalence of anemia in children ages 5–11 years was 19.5 percent;
   it was slightly higher in rural (21.9 percent) than urban (18.3
   percent) areas, higher in indigenous (24 percent) than non-indigenous
   (18 percent) children, and much lower in Mexico City (11 percent) than
   in other regions (18 percent to 24 percent). The micronutrient with the
   highest deficiency prevalence was iron (36 percent), followed by
   vitamin C (30 percent), vitamin A and zinc (about 20 percent), and
   folic acid (about 10 percent). Urban areas had a much lower prevalence
   of iron and zinc deficiencies (38.2 percent and 18.2 percent,
   respectively) than rural areas (48.3 percent and 40 percent,
   respectively) (Rivera and Sepúlveda-Amor, 2003).

   As mentioned earlier, stunting is a public health problem in Mexico,
   but the prevalence of wasting is within expected values for a healthy
   population. Results from the Second National Nutrition Survey (Rivera
   et al., 2001) show that the mean height-for-age z-score is −0.4 from
   0–11 months, drops to −1.1 at 12–23 months, and remains at around −1.0
   up to 59 months of age. The prevalence of stunting is 8.5 percent from
   0–11 months of age, rises sharply to 21.8 percent at 12–23 months, and
   remains at about that level until 4 years of age. These data indicate
   that stunting occurs from birth to 23 months of age and that there is
   no substantial catch-up growth from 23 to 59 months. At the end of the
   preschool period, the height of children is about 1 SD below the mean
   value of the reference population, and about 20 percent of children
   have heights in the lower extreme (< –2 SD) of the reference
   distribution. In contrast, the mean weight-for-height z-score remains
   between +0.1 and +0.3 from birth to 59 months of age, indicating that
   weight relative to height is slightly above the value expected

   given the height of the population. Moreover, wasting remains below 3.5
   percent from birth to 59 months.

   For older children important catch-up growth is not observed either,
   especially in low socioeconomic conditions. Data from the Second
   National Nutrition Survey 1999 showed that children ages 2–9 years from
   the upper 25 percent of the SES index have higher values of
   height-for-age relative to the rest of the population (average
   differences 3.8 cm in girls and 4.1 cm in boys) but are still shorter
   than the WHO/NCHS/CDC reference (average differences 1.6 cm in girls
   and 1.8 cm in boys) (Figures B-3 and B-4) (Monterrubio-Flores, 2006).
   Thus, whereas the prevalence of stunting for 5–11-year-old children is

   The aforementioned data show that childhood obesity represents a
   growing problem in Mexican society, a problem that will add an
   additional burden to a health care system already preoccupied and
   overwhelmed by public health issues related to poverty and
   underdevelopment. When comparing prevalence of under- and overnutrition
   in the populations of the United States and Mexico, two important
   differences emerge. First, the Mexican data clearly reflect a dual
   burden—the problem of undernutrition (especially stunting) and
   micronutrient deficiencies are unsolved and therefore require ongoing
   public health strategies and monitoring systems for addressing the
   problem. In contrast, these problems are not widespread in the American
   population and thus are not public health priorities. Second, the
   prevalence of childhood obesity in Mexico is higher among wealthier
   groups, whereas in the United States, the populations at greatest risk
   for

   obesity are ethnic minorities (e.g., African Americans, Hispanic
   Americans, American Indians) and lower SES families. Interestingly,
   this latter difference does not occur in the Mexican adult population,
   in which obesity is much more homogeneous among SES groups. This
   difference in the distribution of obesity among SES groups between
   children and adults may be related to low SES households providing
   environments that are more prone to encourage infections and
   malnutrition, especially among young children. These differences should
   be considered when formulating recommendations to prevent obesity in
   children and adolescents in Mexicans living in Mexico and those living
   in the United States.

FACTORS INFLUENCING CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT OBESITY

   In order to define a set of recommendations for preventing obesity
   among Mexican children and youth, the relative contribution of
   different determinants driving the problem must be examined. Although
   several scientific observations have built strong evidence on the
   biological and socioeconomic determinants of obesity, the relative
   contribution of these factors is context specific. This section
   contains an analysis and description, based on the best available
   evidence, of the relative weight of potential determinants in the
   Mexican context.

   Using an ecologic framework to understand the determinants of obesity,
   it is clear that several factors at different levels interact to
   explain energy imbalance, which is the direct cause of obesity. The
   next section reviews the relative contribution of the two main factors
   related to energy balance—energy intake versus energy expenditure—and
   explores the social and cultural factors influencing them in the
   Mexican context. The authors use available evidence to describe how the
   environment has changed for Mexican children and youth over the last
   few decades toward an “obesogenic” environment, understood as an
   environment that may promote obesity and encourage the expression of an
   individual’s predisposition to gain weight.

Energy Balance and Individual Factors

   Obesity can be viewed as a problem of a positive energy balance—in
   other words, an excess energy intake relative to a given energy
   expenditure sustained over time. Even a minor energy imbalance over
   time can result in the accumulation of excess body fat. During
   childhood and adolescence, adequate balance should be kept in order to
   allow normal growth. When energy intake exceeds expenditures, including
   the requirement for normal growth and development, then body fat
   accumulates and the risk of obesity

   increases. Dietary intake represents the energy intake side of the
   energy balance equation, while energy expenditure has several
   components—resting metabolic rate, adaptive thermogenesis, the
   thermogenic effect of food, and physical activity (Horton, 1983).

   In addition to energy intake, other factors, including genetics, can
   explain the variability between populations in linear growth. However,
   there is consensus that the variability in linear growth across regions
   is due more to social, demographic, and economic factors than to
   genetics, at least among preschool children (Habicht et al., 1974). In
   an international comparison using the WHO global database on child
   growth and a database of national factors, Frongillo et al. (1997)
   concluded that most national variability of stunting and wasting among
   preschool children was explained by national factors and geographic
   region where higher energy availability, female literacy, and gross
   product were the most important associated factors. The genetic
   contribution to linear growth after puberty remains unknown.

   In the last few decades, extensive research has focused on the search
   for a genetic component in the etiology of obesity, and consequently
   some evidence on the role of genes in the obesity etiology has been
   documented (Snyder et al., 2004; Chagnon et al., 2000; Oksanen et al.,
   1997; Rosenbaum and Leibel, 1998). According to the “thrifty genotype”
   hypothesis, originally proposed in the sixties by James Neel (1962),
   Indian ancestry could be a genetic risk factor for metabolic syndrome
   features, including obesity; the hypothesis could partially explain the
   individual predisposition observed in highly admixed populations such
   as Mexicans. An analysis among Mexican Americans in San Antonio, Texas,
   showed that diabetes risk augments as the Native-American admixture
   increases estimated from skin color measurements (Gardner et al.,
   1984). Recently, the use of ancestral indicator markers has been
   proposed as an alternative methodology to evaluate this hypothesis and
   for genetic mapping purposes, although its effectiveness remains to be
   proven (Fernandez and Shiver, 2004). However, for the moment there has
   not been a gene or even a unique genomic region associated consistently
   with obesity risk. More importantly, the fact that the observed
   worldwide trends in obesity cannot be explained by modification on the
   genetic pool of populations suggests a minor role of the genetic
   component in the current obesity epidemic. Moreover, as a
   non-modifiable factor, the contribution of genetic factors in designing
   effective obesity preventive strategies may have a minor role when
   compared to environmental and behavioral factors.

   Another proposed factor that may increase individual susceptibility to
   obesity and related chronic diseases such as CVD and diabetes, other
   than genetic susceptibility, is malnutrition in early life, especially
   low birth weight (LBW) and stunting before the age of 3 years
   (Caballero, 2001). The in-

   creasing prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases affecting more
   people at younger ages in developing countries than in the developed
   world (WHO, 2006b) may suggest an extra vulnerability of populations in
   epidemiologic transition, such as the Mexican people. If nutritional
   insults in early life confer this extra vulnerability, then the results
   of combating undernutrition in early life (gestation and the first 2–3
   years of life) will have double benefits—adequate nutritional policies
   will affect not only the undernutrition-related problem but also the
   increasing epidemic of chronic diseases.

   After observing an association of LBW and low height at 1 year of age
   with hypertension and other CVD, Barker (1992) proposed the fetal
   origin of disease hypothesis, later known as thrifty phenotype
   hypothesis, as an alternative to the thrifty genotype hypothesis
   previously described (Hales and Barker, 2001). This hypothesis (called
   “programming hypothesis”) suggests that poor fetal or early life
   nutrition causes an adaptation process that increases the capacity to
   store energy, and thus may program future propensity to obesity,
   diabetes, and CVD. Since then, several studies (mainly in developed
   countries) have tried to test this hypothesis with inconclusive
   results. The association between LBW or short stature during early life
   and the risk for diabetes and hypertension has been observed in several
   populations (Simmons, 2005). However, other studies have failed to
   observe the same association (Stern et al., 2000; Lucas et al., 1999).
   The size of the effect and its relative impact of the programming
   hypothesis on the high prevalence of these diseases in developing
   countries remain controversial.

   In terms of the risk of developing obesity in adulthood, the impact of
   fetal or postnatal growth retardation remains unclear. Large cohort
   studies such as the Nurses’ Health Study have shown a J-shape in the
   association of birth weight and adult obesity, with both LBW as well as
   high birth weight showing an increased risk relative to normal birth
   weight (5.6–7 pounds, equivalent to 2.5–3.8 kg) (Rich-Edwards et al.,
   1999). The impact of postnatal growth retardation on the risk of
   obesity is less clear. For instance, the study—which because of its
   natural design has been recognized as quasi-experimental—of records on
   the Dutch famine during World War II has shown that the prevalence of
   adult obesity was higher among those exposed to famine during the first
   two trimesters of pregnancy than among those exposed during the last
   trimester and early infancy. This last group had an even lower
   prevalence of obesity than those who were not exposed to the famine
   (Stein et al., 1995).

   One of the reasons for the inconsistency of the results may be the fact
   that the majority of these studies have been performed in developed
   countries, where there is a low prevalence of undernutrition and
   therefore the effect could be low. On the other hand, the majority of
   these studies have shown that LBW and stunting are not risk factors per
   se. The increased risk

   may be expressed only among subjects who move from a scarcity to an
   abundance of energy intake. Studies characterized by their nutritional
   transition with clear modifications in dietary patterns and lifestyle
   are needed from developing countries to support or reject this
   hypothesis. However, analysis of a Guatemalan population showed that
   fetal programming might have a minor role at least for CVD risk among
   adults (Stein et al., 2002.)

   Although the programming hypothesis is still controversial, while new
   evidence from developing countries arises the potential contribution of
   LBW and short stature during the first years of life in the definition
   of preventive strategies should be considered, especially in Mexico
   where stunting remains as a prevalent problem. In contrast to the
   genetic component information, the basis of programming theory could be
   modified in just one generation if researchers succeed in controlling
   undernutrition during early life. This implies investing in nutrition
   promotion programs in early life as a potential strategy for obesity
   prevention.

Levels of Physical Activity and Inactivity

   Although there is limited information on levels and trends of time
   dedicated to physical activity and inactivity in Mexican children and
   youth, the available information indicates a tendency to sedentary
   lifestyles. In a study conducted on children and youth ages 9–16 years
   in low- and middle-income schools in the Mexico City area, they devoted
   an average of 4.1 hours/day to total video viewing (representing total
   leisure screen time except computer use) and only 1.8 hours/day to
   moderate or vigorous physical activity. Boys reported more television
   viewing and time spent in physical activity than girls (Figure B-5)
   (Hernandez et al., 1999).

   Another study conducted using a similar methodology with youth and
   young adults ages 11–24 years in the state of Morelos, Mexico, found
   results that also suggest a sedentary lifestyle. In this case,
   adolescent boys and young men reported significantly more time
   dedicated to moderate and vigorous physical activities than girls and
   young women. Boys spent more time playing videogames [3.2 (SD 2.4)
   hours daily], than watching television [2.7 (SD 1.9) hours daily],
   while adolescent girls and young women spent 2.6 (SD 2.5) hours daily
   using VCR or videogames and 2.8 (SD 1.9) hours daily watching
   television. Significant differences in the mean daily screen
   time—defined as total hours per day watching television, videogames, or
   VCR—were observed by age, type of community, SES, and medical insurance
   in both adolescent boys and girls and young adult men and women.
   Adolescent girls who reported that they were dieting to lose weight had
   significantly less screen time exposure than girls who wanted to gain
   weight. Mean screen time significantly increased with the level of
   urbanization of the community, and, in girls and young women, screen
   time increased with

   increasing SES (p < 0.01) (Lajous M; personal communication; August
   2004; Cancun, Mexico). A study using data from the Second National
   Nutrition Survey (1999) found that adolescent girls and women ages
   12–49 years dedicated an average of 45 minutes/day to physically active
   sports and 3.64 hours/day to television viewing. Thirty-four percent of
   the adolescent girls and young women ages 12–20 years old reported that
   they practiced sports regularly, and they had higher odds of practicing
   sports than women ages 31–49 years old (Hernandez et al., 2003).

   The association between television viewing and obesity (as measured by
   BMI levels) has been documented (Gortmaker et al., 1996; Robinson,
   2001). This association also was found in Mexico in the studies
   mentioned previously. In the study conducted with children in Mexico
   City, after adjustments for other covariates such as parental obesity,
   SES, age, and gender, children who spent more than 3.1 hours/day
   viewing television programs were 1.69 times more likely to be obese or
   at risk for obesity than children who viewed television programs less
   than 1 hour/day. On the other hand, children who engaged in physical
   activity less than 1 hour/day were 1.6 times more likely to be obese or
   at risk for obesity than children who engaged in physical activity more
   than 2.5 hours/day. When analyzing the associations between television
   program viewing, physical activity, and being obese or at risk for
   obesity, similar associations were found (Table B-2) (Hernandez et al.,
   1999). There were related findings in the study conducted with youth in

Eating Pattern Trends: Nutritional Transition

   As stated previously, Mexico is experiencing a nutritional transition
   with a clear shift over the past decades to higher intakes of fat,
   refined carbohydrates and processed foods, and lower intakes of whole
   grains, vegetables, and dietary fiber that represent traditional diets
   (Popkin, 2001; Rivera et al., 2004a). The transition is closely related
   to the process of urbanization and the migration from rural areas into
   the cities but also is affecting the rural areas to a lesser extent.
   The relationship among the nutritional transition, urbanization, and
   poverty is complex and manifests differently in various countries.
   Studies have shown that the nutritional transition was observed mainly
   among the higher SES groups living in rural areas and among low SES
   groups in urban areas, suggesting that lower-income populations,
   principally in urbanized environments, could be affected by the two
   extremes of the nutritional spectrum (Seidell, 2000). In Mexico, the
   nutritional transition, as assessed by changes in dietary fat intakes
   and BMI values in adults, has been observed in all regions regardless
   of their level of development, in urban and rural areas, and in all
   socioeconomic groups. In contrast, as presented previously, high BMIs
   in children are more prevalent in the more developed regions and urban
   areas. However, evidence suggests that children living in low-income
   neighborhoods and attending public schools in Tijuana along the Mexican
   side of the U.S.–Mexican border are

   experiencing a nutrition transition with respect to an increased risk
   of obesity and related chronic disease (Villa-Caballero et al., 2005).

   The strongest evidence of this transition comes from the contrast
   between adults’ self-reported dietary intakes from the 1988 and 1999
   National Nutritional Surveys. During this 11-year period, the
   percentage of energy intake from fat among Mexicans increased from 23.5
   percent to 30.3 percent (Figure B-6). This increment was observed
   across all regions of the country, including the poorest region
   (south), which increased from 22.1–26.9 percent during the same time
   period (Rivera et al., 2004a). However, this increment was not observed
   in rural areas, where the percentage of energy intake from fat remained
   stable at 22–23 percent. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information
   about changes in the type of fats (e.g., saturated, trans fat, and
   unsaturated fat) in the Mexican diet, especially for children and
   youth.

   In this same analysis, the mean percentage of energy intake from
   carbohydrates decreased slightly from 59.7 percent to 57.5 percent.
   However, the lack of information on the type of carbohydrate
   (especially in the 1988 survey) limits the possibility to analyze
   intakes of refined versus complex

   carbohydrates. A secondary analysis using data from National Income and
   Expenditure Surveys collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística,
   Geografía e Informática (INEGI) from 1984 to 1998 showed that consumer
   purchases of refined carbohydrates and sweetened sodas increased by 6.3
   percent and 37.2 percent from 1984 to 1998, respectively, whereas the
   amount of fruit and vegetables purchased dropped by almost 30 percent
   during the same period (Figure B-7) (Rivera et al., 2004). This
   observation suggests that complex carbohydrate intake has declined.
   Whether or not the modification of relative prices of these food
   commodities during this period played an influential role in the
   consumer purchases is an area that requires further research.

   In the Second National Nutrition Survey 1999, dietary intake for
   school-aged children was evaluated using a 24-hour dietary recall.
   Foods were ranked according to their contribution to the total amount
   of food intake (in grams). Four food groups represented nearly 50
   percent of their total amount of food consumed. The main contributors
   to children’s diets were milk and dairy products (185.5 g), tortilla
   and maize products (156.4 g), and sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages
   (135.3 g). Only 8 percent of the children had fruits and vegetable
   intakes greater than 400 g/day, which represents the current
   recommended intake (WCRF, 1997), while 56 percent had intakes less than
   100 g/day (Figure B-8) (Ramirez CI and Rivera JA; personal
   communication; February 2006). The median energy intake in preschool
   children was 949 calories and 1,377 in school-aged children. Pro-

   tein intake in both groups was well above adequate levels at 150
   percent of estimated requirements. Children living in the northern and
   Mexico City regions had the highest fat intake and the lowest fiber
   intake. Children living in the southern region, indigenous children,
   and those in the lowest SES group had higher fiber and carbohydrate
   intakes and the lowest fat intake (Barquera et al., 2003).

   A study conducted using data from the Second National Nutrition Survey
   1999 classified foods consumed by children ages 1–4 years as either
   centrally processed or not processed. Centrally processed foods are
   defined as those involving any kind of industrial process, whether they
   are foods that had been consumed without industrial process before
   (e.g., milk or bread) or foods that were developed by industry (e.g.,
   sweetened soda and packaged snack foods). Centrally processed foods
   made an important contribution to the total energy and nutrient intakes
   at the national level and in sub-populations. For example, the
   contribution to total energy intake was 46 percent; protein intake was
   39 percent; total fat intake was 56 percent; and saturated fat intake
   was 69 percent. These findings underscore the im-

Factors that Influence Energy Intake and Energy Expenditure

Family and Sociocultural Factors

   Family and cultural values are strong determinants of both eating
   patterns and physical activity levels (Patrick and Nicklas, 2005).
   Although direct evidence was not available on the role of family and
   cultural values as determinants of childhood obesity in Mexico, there
   is anecdotal evidence suggesting that chubby children are perceived to
   be healthy children, especially among the poorest and rural
   sub-populations, in Mexican society. Researchers are unaware of any
   empirical evidence supporting this widespread cultural belief or its
   origin. It has been suggested that recent and concurrent undernutrition
   in the same communities or even in the same families, reinforce the
   ideas that heavier children are healthier. In a small

   study in Xalapa, Veracruz, half of all parents of obese children did
   not identify their own children as having any weight problem (Brewis,
   2003). This parental perception suggests either a level of denial or a
   normalization of obesity that reinforces children to be heavier than
   the accepted healthy range. These beliefs, combined with other cultural
   values such as feeding a child as an act of love and caring, or that
   acquiring and using consumer goods that decrease physical activity such
   as television, video games, and cars are identified as markers of
   higher SES within communities, need to be counterbalanced with
   community-based interventions that empower parents and key community
   members to promote healthier lifestyles. This is an area where both
   observational and experimental research are greatly needed.

   Self-reported energy intake can vary considerably between non-obese and
   obese subjects. Based on data from the Second National Nutrition Survey
   1999, researchers estimated energy under-reporting in Mexican women
   ages 18–49 years using a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire.
   Researchers found that the prevalence of energy under-reporting in
   non-obese women was approximately one-third (33.66 percent) and more
   than half (53.73 percent) in obese women. The adjusted prevalence ratio
   for under-reporting was 1.51 times higher in obese compared with
   non-obese women (95 percent CI 1.35, 1.69). The researchers concluded
   that obese Mexican women tend to under-report energy consumption more
   than their non-obese coun-

   terparts. The differential under-reporting in Mexico between obese and
   non-obese women suggests that there is a perception of the association
   between diet and excess weight, which may be a positive sign of
   increasing awareness of the epidemic (Campirano et al., 2003). However,
   experimental studies in children and adolescents have shown that mean
   daily caloric intakes may be under-reported by as much as 17 to 33
   percent of energy expenditure and that under-reporting tends to
   increase with age (Bandini et al., 2003; Champagne et al., 1998).
   Similar methodological challenges exist for conducting research on
   children’s physical activity levels (IOM, 2005).

   Another factor that may influence dietary patterns and physical
   activity is the change in family structure experienced in Mexico during
   the last two to three decades. The following additional issues also may
   influence dietary and physical activity patterns: the increase of
   women’s roles in the labor force, increasing rates of divorce and
   single parenthood, increasing numbers of families with key members in
   the United States, and decreasing household size. For example, reduced
   time available for food selection and for cooking can encourage the use
   of more energy-dense processed food and therefore can influence the
   quality of the diet. Also, reduced time of parents at home coupled with
   increasing levels of insecurity in the streets may encourage television
   viewing and sedentary lifestyles. However, empirical evidence of these
   possible effects in Mexico is lacking.

Environmental Factors: Transition Toward an Obesogenic Environment

   Opportunities for physical activity. Information about access and use
   of television and the Internet indicates that Mexico is moving toward a
   more sedentary environment. The number of television stations operating
   in the country has increased from 115 in 1980 to 658 in 2004
   (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes, 2005). Not surprisingly,
   by 2000 85 percent of the households in Mexico had access to a
   television set, and this proportion reached 97 percent in Mexico City.
   Even in the states with a high poverty level, such as Chiapas or
   Oaxaca, more than 56 percent of the households had a television set
   (INEGI, 2000). Mexico has a higher number of television sets per capita
   than most Latin American countries, although the number is still lower
   than that in the United States (Figure B-11). However, exposure to
   television in Mexico can be underestimated because Mexican households
   are larger than those in the United States. Restricted television
   (television systems that charge for access) also is becoming more
   popular, increasing from 1,250,000 subscriptions in 1995 to 2,660,000
   in 2003 (COFETEL, 2005).

   In addition to the explosive growth of the television industry in
   Mexico, the Internet also is becoming more popular. The number of
   Internet users grew from 94,000 in 1995 to 16,492,454 in 2005 (INEGI,
   2005a). Most

   importantly, Internet use is concentrated in youth and adolescents, as
   shown in Figure B-12, rising from 2.43 percent to 7.73 percent between
   2001 and 2005 for children ages 6–11 years and from 14.41 percent to
   34.16 percent between the same years in adolescents ages 12–17 years.
   Finally, it is estimated that more than 22.8 million Mexicans—13.1
   percent of 6- to 11-year-old children and 28.1 percent of 12- to
   17-year-old adolescents—use computers (INEGI, 2005b).

   Another indicator suggesting that the Mexican population is moving
   toward an obesogenic environment with reduced options to engage in
   physical activity is the growth in the number of motorized vehicles.
   Although the population of Mexico has increased 17 percent from 1990 to
   2000, the number of motor vehicles registered increased by 38 percent
   during the same period of time, representing nearly 11 million
   automobiles in 2000 and 13.5 million automobiles in 2002 (INEGI,
   2005b).

   Trends in access to unhealthy and healthy foods. Over the past few
   decades, Mexicans have experienced an increased availability and access
   to less healthful foods and beverages (e.g., high energy–dense, low
   nutrient– dense, and low-fiber foods and high-calorie low-nutrient
   beverages). This is especially true for Mexicans living in urban areas.
   This increased access to these types of foods and beverages is yet
   another fact indicating the country is shifting toward an obesogenic
   environment.

   Transnational corporations representing the fast food restaurant or
   quick serve restaurant industry have expanded substantially over all
   the major and middle-size cities across Mexico. The first Mexican
   franchise of McDonald’s Corporation opened in 1985 in one of the
   wealthiest neighborhoods of Mexico City. According to the company’s
   website, there are currently 320 franchises nationwide located not only
   in wealthy areas but also in middle- and low-income neighborhoods
   (McDonald’s Corporation, 2006). A very similar phenomenon has happened
   with other restaurant companies such ALSEA, which operates Domino’s
   Pizza and Burger King in Mexico. According to a company report (ALSEA,
   2005), over 15 years, the quick serve restaurant company has
   established 529 Domino’s Pizza sites in 123 cities and promoted sales
   of more than 37 million pizzas in 2004. Indeed, hamburgers and pizza
   are the major types of fast food restaurants representing 30 percent
   and 37 percent, respectively, of the entire fast food market in Mexico.
   The success of these companies relies on the acceptance of their
   products by Mexicans. Given the huge consumer demand, the meals are
   affordable for a large proportion of the population (Hawkes, 2002).

   Another form of energy-dense foods that are widely available is Mexican
   street foods that are sold informally on the streets in cities as well
   as in schools. Although data are limited about the numbers of sites,
   varieties, prices, and nutrient-content of the Mexican street foods,
   this industry appears to be rooted in Mexican culinary culture and its
   growth has paralleled the population growth in urban areas. An
   important feature of this industry

   is the modification of traditional Mexican food that usually was not
   fried and contained tomato, hot pepper, and other vegetables. However,
   current street foods sold are high energy–dense as a result of
   widespread use of vegetable oil for frying, increasing the use of cream
   and cheese, and reducing the use of vegetables. Therefore, this
   “Mexican fast food,” which is not centrally processed, is an important
   source of total energy in the Mexican diet, including children and
   youth.

   As with the fast food restaurant industry, the high consumption of
   sweetened beverages, particularly carbonated soft drinks, in Mexico is
   linked to large-scale marketing activities across multiple media
   platforms (e.g., print, radio, broadcast and cable television,
   Internet, outdoor signage). Indeed, according to a WHO report that
   reviewed marketing activities of global soft drink and fast food
   companies in emerging markets, Mexico was identified as the world’s
   leading per-capita consumer of Coca-Cola. In 1998, Mexicans consumed
   more than 400 milliliters per day of sweetened carbonated soft drinks.
   By volume of sales, Mexico is the Coca-Cola Company’s second largest
   market after the United States (Hawkes et al., 2002).

   Another important source of energy in the Mexican diet is the high
   intake of oil. The use of oils with a high trans fatty acid content has
   increased considerably in both the fast food industry and in baked and
   fried foods and snacks produced by industry. Also, high fructose corn
   syrup has been replacing the sugar cane as a sweetener in soft drink
   production, although some evidence exists about its potential impact on
   weight gain (Bray et al., 2004), this is still a topic of much debate.
   The association of certain types of fats or sweeteners to obesity
   remains unknown and needs further research.

   Advertising and marketing trends. In 2004, food advertising was ranked
   fourth and beverage advertising was ranked sixth in 20 categories for
   the amount spent on advertising to Mexicans through television, radio,
   and print media totaling US $1.064 billion and US $565 million,
   respectively. Television advertising is the primary venue for food and
   beverage advertising to the Mexican population (WARC, 2005). There were
   limited data publicly available to the authors documenting the growing
   trend of companies’ promotion of high energy–dense and low
   nutrient–dense foods and sweetened beverages, sedentary activities, and
   entertainment to Mexican children and youth. There are data showing
   that fast food restaurant and beverage companies engage in
   philanthropic activities and sponsorship of sporting events as ways to
   market to Mexican youth (Hawkes, 2002). The Global Kids Study,
   conducted in 1996 and 1998 by Just Kid Inc., Nickelodeon, and Research
   International, provides information about the brand and consumer
   environment, attitudes, beliefs, and consumption behaviors

   of a cohort of 400 children, ages 7–12 years, and their mothers who
   were surveyed in each of six countries. The purpose of the marketing
   research was to provide Nickelodeon with a strategic planning tool to
   support the entertainment company’s international business initiatives
   targeting children and youth in countries such as Mexico. The cities
   where the study was conducted in Mexico include Mexico City,
   Guadalajara, and Monterey. An interview and questionnaire were used to
   gather detailed marketing research data about the children and their
   families. The findings showed that international global brands, such as
   Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken, are well
   recognized by Mexican children based on their brand awareness and
   preferences (Friend and Stapylton-Smith, 1999). There are presently no
   publicly available data documenting Mexican children’s and youths’
   discretionary income, particularly among higher SES groups, which they
   may use to purchase foods and beverages without parental guidance,
   especially away from home settings such as fast food restaurants,
   shopping malls, and schools.

   Consumers ages 18 years and younger are subject to special protection
   under Mexican law. However, there is currently no single governmental
   authority or body of law governing products or advertising to Mexican
   children and youth. The three government institutions primarily
   responsible for the regulation of children’s advertising in Mexico are
   the Attorney General for Consumer Protection, Ministry of the Interior,
   and the Ministry of Health (Arochi et al., 2004). The non-governmental
   self-regulatory organization in Mexico is the National Council for
   Advertising (Consejo Nacional de la Publicidad) (Friedman and Dickler,
   2003). There are clear guidelines and laws restricting the promotion of
   alcohol and tobacco products to Mexican children. According to Article
   16 of the Communications Council Code of Ethics, advertisers must not
   “undermine parental authority, judgment, or preferences” and “children
   should not be encouraged to urge other persons to purchase a product,
   especially their parents.” Companies are also encouraged to avoid
   taking advantage of children’s credulity or lack of experience. While
   television and radio advertising should not exceed 18 percent of the
   total time of transmission to Mexicans, special regulations for
   children’s advertising have not yet been developed in Mexico.
   Furthermore, there are currently no guidelines or regulations for the
   promotion of high-calorie and low-nutrient foods and beverages to young
   consumers (Arochi et al., 2004).

   However, Mexico is one of the many countries that endorsed the WHO
   Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health at the 57th
   World Health Assembly in 2004 (WHO, 2004). The Global Strategy provides
   member states with a range of policy options to address less healthful
   dietary practices and physical inactivity, including provisions for
   marketing, advertising, sponsorship, and promotion to support
   international public

   health goals. These provisions recommended that “food and beverage
   advertisements should not exploit children’s inexperience or
   credulity,” should discourage messages that promote less healthful
   dietary practices, and encourage positive healthful messages (WHO,
   2004).

   School environments. Unhealthy weight in children, particularly in
   school-age children, results from an environment that enhances the
   intake of high energy–dense foods and restricts the opportunities for
   regular physical activity. Children spend a substantial amount of time
   at school. Therefore, the school environment is an important influence
   on their physical activity behaviors and dietary patterns.

   The Ministry of Education implements a physical education program in
   elementary schools nationwide (Secretaría de Educación Pública, 1994)
   that envisions two physical education sessions, each lasting about
   30–50 minutes per week, as a means to promote a healthy lifestyle. The
   program also aims to promote a healthy diet through elementary-level
   educational materials that include units related to hygiene and
   nutrition and the promotion of healthful lifestyles.

   The physical education component of the program is structured according
   to the different skills and development characteristics attributable to
   each age group. The program is designed to promote five different types
   of skills. Stimulation of motor perception; conditional physical
   skills; basic sports skills building; physical education for health;
   and social interaction. The plan includes a section that suggests
   several activities and one more that recommends methods for evaluating
   the plan’s performance. Nevertheless, the program is not implemented as
   designed according to existing policies.

   Researchers conducted a search for publications on the school
   environment and its relationship to childhood obesity in Mexican
   schools but was not able to find published articles on this topic.
   However, formative research was obtained from a project that was
   recently initiated in 12 public schools in Mexico City; the project
   aims to change the core elements in the school environment that promote
   obesity (Rivera J, National Institute of Public Health; personal
   communication; March 2006). The first phase of the project undertook an
   assessment of the school environment. Preliminary data from children in
   4th and 5th grades in 12 schools representing over 1700 students showed
   that children, are exposed to an unhealthy environment in several ways.
   Children are exposed to high energy–dense foods (e.g., high-fat and
   high-sugar snacks and foods such as candy, ice cream, pizza, pork skin
   chips with cream, tacos, and other traditional Mexican fried foods) and
   to large portion sizes. In addition, children eat several times at
   school (they have as much as six feeding opportunities during the four
   hours at school). The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables is
   very lim-

   ited, and most often the available fruits are served with cream. The
   preparation and handling of foods sold in schools are under uncertain
   sanitary conditions that increases the food safety risks for the
   children. Additionally, most of the schools lack free drinking water
   from fountains. In the few schools where potable water fountains are
   available, they are not well maintained and are not used for drinking
   water.

   Physical activity is low. The school-break period is the time designed
   to eat lunch, and there is limited time left for active play or
   physical activity. During this time children are not allowed to run due
   to safety concerns, because all grades have recess at the same time and
   older children running or playing could harm younger children. In
   addition, there is limited space available for physical activity in
   many of the schools surveyed. In general, the school facilities and
   sports equipment do not facilitate adequate physical education classes
   and children spend on average less than 40 minutes of Physical
   Education (PE) per week, about 40 percent of the time established by
   norms (100 minutes per week). Moreover, PE classes are not active
   enough; children spend only nine minutes per week on moderate to
   vigorous physical activity.

   These results are similar to findings from a small pilot study in 10
   schools in Mexico City. In this sample, approximately half of the
   schools in the pilot study did not have appropriate areas for the
   physical education classes; the average space available was 290 m^2 for
   approximately 330 students. Moreover, teachers showed little motivation
   to promote physical activity, and the physical education classes were
   not well structured. Approximately 30 percent of children did not
   participate in physical education classes, and moderate to vigorous
   physical activity was achieved for approximately 10 minutes by those
   participating in the physical education classes. In 80 percent of the
   schools the average length of the physical education class is 50
   minutes a day, and the remaining 20 percent of the schools divide the
   class length by age groups (30 minutes for children younger than 10
   years of age and 50 minutes for older children) two times per week.
   Only 20 percent of the schools organize and promote extracurricular
   sporting events such as soccer and athletics tournaments. One of the
   major limitations of extracurricular physical activity programs is that
   many schools have several shifts (e.g., morning and evening) at the
   same facility, so that extracurricular physical activity programs are
   not possible. The following issues were identified as potentially
   important in terms of their influence on behavior and dietary intake at
   school:
     * Lack of drinking water from water fountains or other public
       supplies at schools in seven of the eight schools surveyed, which
       may promote the intake of sweetened beverages.

     * Lack of bottled water and the widespread availability of sweetened
       beverages in concession stands that have similar prices; therefore,
       there may be a reduced incentive for the children to drink water
       during the school day.
     * Lack of regulations for foods and beverages sold either at
       concession stands on the school grounds or at retail establishments
       located near schools.
     * The federally funded and mandatory school breakfast program
       provides energy-dense and centrally processed foods at very
       affordable prices.
     * Widespread availability of high energy–dense foods and sweetened
       beverages within and around the school environment.
     * Low availability of vegetables and fruits within and around the
       school environment.

   Although this formative research is not representative of public
   schools throughout Mexico, or even the schools in Mexico City, it
   provides a qualitative assessment of the school environment that may be
   useful to identify the elements within the environment that promote
   obesity and opportunities for positively intervening to promote a
   healthier school environment.

   Other environmental factors. These factors are important determinants
   of an environment favoring a positive energy balance in most of the
   Mexican population. However, there are many other factors that are
   likely to influence children and youth and can be considered components
   of an obesogenic environment. However, there is limited research on
   these factors upon which to design evidence-based strategies for
   effectively preventing obesity in Mexican children and youth.

   The exponential growth of mega cities in Mexico, with a lack of
   environmental design planning to facilitate physical activity, are
   likely to have an important impact on the availability and access to
   physical activity facilities, especially in poor and new neighborhoods
   in the suburbs of these cities. Data regarding availability and use of
   physical activity facilities are clearly needed to evaluate and
   potentially modify this factor. Another issue potentially contributing
   to reduced physical activity are safety concerns and poor air quality
   in Mexican cities, especially in Mexico City, which has been identified
   as one of the cities worldwide with the highest level of air pollution
   (Villarreal-Calderón et al., 2002).

   Finally, with regard to energy intake, it is likely that a change in
   agricultural and food production policies favoring large-scale
   production, marketing supports for commercial producers, and developing
   a more competitive agricultural sector for export markets (Zahniser et
   al., 2005) could modify the price and access of certain foods but not
   necessarily the most healthful choices. Many of these policies adhere
   to international trade agreements such as North American Free Trade
   Agreement (NAFTA) (Zahniser et al., 2005); thus the impact and
   consequences they may have on the di-

   etary patterns of the Mexican population has not been fully explored.
   Further research in this area is needed.

CURRENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

   Despite the strong evidence of an increasing obesity epidemic among
   children and adolescents in Mexico, its impact on the awareness of the
   population at different levels has been limited. Within the last few
   years, perhaps as a consequence of published research and dissemination
   of the Second National Nutritional Survey 1999 results, the obesity
   epidemic has reached the media, especially print- and web-based media.
   Among the scientific community, obesity, particularly in children, is
   currently a topic that has generated a great deal of attention in terms
   of funding and human resources, with support for several ongoing
   research projects. However, there is still an enormous need for raising
   awareness at the individual, family, and community levels, as well as
   within the government sector at all levels. Probably because of the
   recent and still current problem of undernutrition as one of the main
   public health problems among children, the complete understanding of
   the double burden of undernutrition and obesity from the government and
   policymakers is needed to elevate childhood obesity as a national
   priority.

   As a consequence of the low awareness within the government sector,
   there are a limited number of programs, mostly on a small scale, and
   information about these programs is not readily available. The next
   section describes selected programs and policies that are related to
   the obesity problem.

Government Policies on Food Labeling, Media Control, and Dietary Guidelines

   Mexico has a set of policies, norms, and guidelines for food labeling
   and media control of advertising food products. However, there are many
   inconsistencies during the implementation of these policies, and many
   of them have not been periodically reviewed or modified in response to
   the increasing public health problem of obesity. There has not been any
   evaluation on consumer understanding and the impact of the information
   provided on food labels. Regarding the media control, as noted earlier,
   television advertising is the primary venue for food and beverage
   advertising to the Mexican population (WARC, 2005). However, there is a
   lack of data on the effects of advertising on Mexican children’s
   preferences, purchase requests, and influence on household purchases of
   food and beverage products. Limited evidence indicates that there may
   be a rise in television advertising of processed foods and beverages
   high in sugar or fat, or both, and

   with healthy nutrition claims without specific policies guiding the
   health claims or types of advertising reaching young children.

   For several years a group of nutrition experts has been working on
   developing dietary guidelines for Mexico. After a long process that led
   to consensus-based guidelines, they are soon to be officially published
   for the Mexican population. The guidelines are based on a plate model
   rather than a food guide pyramid (Figure B-13) and present food groups
   and advice on ways that consumers can combine them. Since these are
   consensus-based guidelines, this educational tool can be used as the
   basis for developing an effective communication strategy aimed at
   improving dietary practices in Mexico.

Social Programs

Oportunidades

   The pillar of the Mexican social assistance strategy is the conditional
   cash transfer program, Oportunidades. The objective of the program is
   to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty though the development
   of human capital. At present, the program reaches more than five
   million families (about 25 million people) living in extreme poverty.

   Oportunidades provides families with a monetary transfer intended for
   food purchase, a fortified food supplement for all children from 6 to

   (to whom the monetary transfer is also given) to a series of health and
   nutrition education workshops. The program also provides curative
   health care (SEDESOL, 2006).

   A number of positive impacts of the Oportunidades program on
   nutritional status of the population have been reported. In both urban
   (Neufeld et al., 2006) and rural Mexico (Rivera et al., 2004b)
   participation is the program resulted in an increase of approximately 1
   cm in linear growth of children who were in the program from a very
   young age (< 6 mo) compared to children of similar age not in the
   program. A positive impact on the prevalence of anemia has also been
   reported among children less than 2 years of age (Rivera et al., 2004;
   Neufeld et al., 2005). However, there is concern that participation in
   the program may promote undesirable excess weight gain. Increased
   weight gain with improved socioeconomic status and higher income has
   been documented in a number of settings around the world (Uauy et al.,
   2001; Du et al., 2004). The extra resources provided to the family may
   be used to purchase more high energy–dense foods and sweetened
   beverages. The fortified food supplement for women and children provide
   approximately 1.4 and 2.15 kcal/g, respectively. In this population
   where the diet does not appear to have an energy deficit, regular
   consumption of the supplement in addition to the usual home diet
   without substitution of a similar quantity of energy may result in
   excess weight gain. Regular consumption is clearly desirable due to its
   high micronutrient content, approximately 100 percent of the
   Recommended Dietary Intake (IOM, 2001) of iron, zinc, and a number of
   other micronutrients known to be deficient in the diets of Mexican
   children and women during pregnancy and lactation (Rivera et al., 2003)
   . Consumption of the supplement has been shown to result in
   considerable improvements in the dietary intake of micronutrients and
   there is some indication of improvements in mineral status of women and
   children (Neufeld et al., 2006). On the other hand, the health and
   nutrition workshops and increased exposure to preventative health care
   services may lead to improved dietary and lifestyle choices among
   beneficiaries with a resultant decrease in the prevalence and/or
   severity of obesity.

   The prevalence of obesity in adults who were eventually enrolled in the
   program (before program benefits were received) was over 20 percent
   (Fernald et al., 2004). In women living in urban Mexico, program
   participation was associated with a greater increase in body mass index
   over a two-year follow-up period compared to non-participants,
   particularly among those who had high body mass index at the start of
   the follow-up

   (Neufeld et al., 2006). There was an increase of 1.5 percent in the
   prevalence of obesity in adolescents involved in the program when
   compared to adolescents who did not participate (Gutiérrez et al.,
   2005). Among preschool children, there is no evidence that
   participation in the program is associated with obesity, although there
   was a tendency towards higher BMI among the children who were enrolled
   in the program before 6 months of age, compared to non-beneficiaries
   (Neufeld et al., 2006).

   The Oportunidades program with its system of co-responsibilities and
   its broad coverage is a promising vehicle through which to launch
   obesity prevention. Two studies are currently underway as part of the
   program evaluation activities to further clarify the impact of the
   program on weight gain among women and children and to strengthen the
   health education component of the program in reference to obesity
   prevention. The first is a large randomized controlled trial
   implemented within the context of the program. The main objective of
   the study is to determine whether regular consumption of the fortified
   food supplement is associated with increased weight gain among children
   and women during pregnancy and increased weight retention post partum
   compared to two other supplements with identical micronutrient content
   but without additional energy. The second study uses qualitative
   research methods to gain an understanding of the perceived determinants
   of overweight and obesity in the population and barriers to change in
   behaviors associated with excess weight gain. The results of both
   studies will be presented to decision makers within the program with
   specific recommendations of how to strengthen obesity prevention among
   program beneficiaries.

Health-Sector Programs

Preven-IMSS

   The National Institute for Social Security (IMSS) provides health
   services to approximately 50 percent of the Mexican population. As part
   of the organization’s process of health improvement services, they
   recently designed and implemented an integrated health programs
   strategy known as Preven-IMSS. This strategy is focused on a portfolio
   of preventive actions aimed at improving the health status of their
   target population and marks the first time that IMSS has launched a
   large-scale prevention program. Starting in 2002, actions were
   organized by age group and vulnerable populations: children (younger
   than 10 years of age), adolescents (ages 10– 19 years), women (ages
   20–59 years), men (ages 20–59 years), and older adults (older than 60
   years of age). All the programs include major food and nutrition,
   physical activity, and health education components (Gutiérrez-Trujillo,
   2005).

   The main preventive actions for children are focused on health
   promotion, nutrition education, disease control and prevention, early
   identification of diseases, oral health, vaccination, and miscellaneous
   actions (e.g., personal hygiene, breastfeeding promotion, and fever
   control). For adolescents, the program’s preventive actions are focused
   on physical activity promotion; accident prevention; violence and
   addiction prevention; oral health; sexual health and education;
   nutrition education; obesity detection and control; parasite treatment;
   vaccination; use of preservatives; human immunodeficiency virus and
   sexually transmitted diseases prevention; visual, auditory, and
   postural defects; and reproductive health. There are also components
   for adults.

   For each preventive action, there is a set of designed activities and
   objectives personalized for each age group. As part of the promotion
   strategy, this program has a nationally distributed magazine (sold at
   newspaper shops) that features health care information related to these
   actions. In addition, television advertisements focus on healthy
   lifestyles, nutrition, obesity prevention, and promoting the magazine
   to the general public. Until now, this program has not been evaluated
   fully; however, a recent internal baseline survey was designed and
   implemented to assess the coverage of the main components and to
   evaluate intermediate program outcomes such as prevalence of anemia,
   frequency of physical activity, undernutrition, overweight, and
   obesity. This survey found an inadequate register of the nutritional
   status in the diverse population groups and of the health promotion
   activities. It is expected that one-year follow-up surveys will monitor
   selected outcomes of this integrated health program
   (Gutiérrez-Trujillo, 2005).

Ministry of Health Programs for Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases

   The Ministry of Health of Mexico has several programs that consider
   prevention as a relevant component (Ministry of Health, 2006). These
   programs are not integrated health or nutrition programs but programs
   focused primarily on the most relevant public health problems, such as
   obesity, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and cancer. Each of
   these diseases has a program that includes general management and
   preventive recommendations that must be followed by the government
   health service providers. However, most (if not all) of these programs,
   focus attention on promoting behavioral changes and early detection in
   adults, especially young adults over the age of 20 years. Obesity
   prevention during childhood and adolescence has been given much less
   consideration; rather, the predominant problems of concern for this
   group are related to food security (undernutrition and micronutrients
   deficiencies).

   The following are some recently implemented actions for increasing the
   awareness and actions related to obesity prevention in children and
   youth in the public sector:
    1. Implementation of regional or state-level programs; evaluation by
       the state (public) health sector needs to be conducted.
    2. Creation of obesity clinics in public pediatric hospitals
       addressing the clinical care and management of obese children and
       research focuses on the consequences of obesity.
    3. Development of an official memo outlining a future nationwide
       communication campaign for obesity prevention that in addition to
       addressing food production, media regulation, and food labeling, is
       intended to promote healthier lifestyles with special attention to
       children and adolescents.
    4. Addition of obesity prevention among children and adolescents as
       one of the five priorities for research funding in the last request
       for proposals by CONACYT, the federal agency that provides
       oversight for research funding.

   Moreover, recent efforts by the private sector have been implemented
   but must still be evaluated.

GOALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   In accordance with the recommendations in the IOM report, Preventing
   Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005), the final goals
   for obesity prevention among childhood and youth should be to stop the
   current trend in rising obesity incidence and prevalence and related
   chronic diseases and ultimately reduce the proportion of children and
   youth with an unhealthy weight. This ultimate goal necessarily should
   include increasing the proportion of children and adolescents meeting a
   healthful diet and appropriate amounts of regular physical activity and
   following a healthy growth trajectory. In the process of achieving
   these goals, it is important to define intermediate outcomes that will
   be needed to evaluate progress of a multi-faceted obesity prevention
   strategy. Based on the information described in previous sections, the
   authors propose a series of goals and recommendations for action for a
   multilevel and nationwide obesity prevention strategy among children
   and adolescents. An objective of the U.S.–Mexico binational meeting
   will be to broadly discuss this list of recommendations among key
   persons from each sector (e.g., academia, government, industry,
   schools, communities) to reach consensus on the next steps needed to
   initiate this multilevel strategy. A list of possible intermediate
   outcomes and goals for discussion during the binational meeting
   include:

     * Increased quantity and quality of physical activity at schools in
       both planned physical education time and recreational time such as
       recess.
     * Increased and improved facilities for recreational activities in
       communities, especially suburban areas.
     * Increased advertising and marketing messages in preferably
       broadcast, cable, and satellite television, but also in other media
       such as radio, the Internet, and cell phones, aimed at children,
       youth, and their parents that promote healthy lifestyles, including
       healthful diets and regular physical activity.
     * Decreased number of media advertising or marketing campaigns
       promoting high-calorie and low-nutrient food and beverage products
       targeted at children and adolescents that increase the risk of
       positive energy balance (such as refined sugars and saturated and
       trans fats).
     * Decreased proportion of children and youth who have more than two
       hours of leisure screen time (including television and video
       watching) per day.
     * Increased proportion of children and youth consuming more than five
       portions of fruits and vegetables per day.

   As stated in the IOM recommendations, in order to achieve these types
   of intermediate outcomes, a multilevel strategy clearly is needed.
   However, in contrast to the U.S. context, Mexican society at large
   (e.g., government, industry, community leaders, schools, families) is
   far behind on some fundamental aspects needed to build support for this
   strategy. Three main issues that should be covered as priority steps in
   developing an effective obesity prevention strategy are:
     * creating awareness among decision makers (including all branches of
       federal and state powers) as well as among the general public;
     * regulating and enforcing laws;
     * empowering communities so that they can achieve the necessary
       changes in different environments (e.g., school, community,
       industry) that, as described in previous sections, are contributing
       to a net positive energy balance among Mexicans in general, and
       specifically children and youth.

   Priority recommendations for action specifically related to the Mexican
   context are listed below. The recommendations can be viewed as
   preliminary and will be modified through discussion with different
   stakeholders.

Government Level

     * Underpin the idea of childhood obesity prevention as an urgent
       national priority, with strong participation and leadership of
       government at all levels in several actions including:

     * Regulations and implementation of media and food, beverage, and
       restaurant industry policies;
     * Support and funding of obesity prevention programs at federal and
       state levels with planned evaluations of their health impact;
     * Support and funding of surveillance and monitoring efforts and wide
       dissemination of their findings not only at the national level,
       such as the National Nutrition Surveys, but also at the state and
       county levels;
     * Planning of urban development with an appropriate access and
       promotion of facilities for recreational activities;
     * Initiation of a widespread nationwide media campaign across print,
       electronic (e.g., radio, television), and wireless and
       Internet-based media (e.g., cell phones) to increase awareness of
       the obesity problem in the population;
     * Expand the training of professionals to design, implement, and
       evaluate strategies for effectively responding to the obesity
       epidemic.

     * Review current regulations for food labeling (NOM 051-SECOFI and
       NOM-086-SSA1-1994), evaluate the impact and consumers’
       understanding of food labeling, and make necessary modifications
       required to support obesity prevention goals.
     * Review current government regulations and guidelines on the use of
       health claims on food products, especially nutrition-related health
       claims.
     * Develop incentives or regulations for advertising and marketing to
       children and youth, especially for food and beverage products high
       in total calories and in particular for those with a high content
       of refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and fat.
     * Seek mechanisms such as incentives or regulations to improve the
       enforcement of policies related to media and the food, beverage,
       and restaurant industries, including food labeling.
     * Create an advisory committee that, together with the Federal
       Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS), will
       develop and evaluate policies for food labeling, marketing, media
       control, and dietary guidelines. This committee should include
       experts from different public and private institutions, as well as
       industry representatives and consumers. Priority steps should focus
       on the following areas:
          + Modify food labeling, focusing on the need of acceptance and
            understanding for the majority of the population. Limited
            evidence suggests that most of the information contained on
            food labels is difficult for consumers to understand. Develop
            communication strategies that are clear and understandable by
            the general public.
          + Reduce, at minimum, the content of health claims in
            media-based marketing, especially for those foods that promote
            “healthy” choices that do not meet basic nutritional
            guidelines.

          + Conduct research on advertising and marketing targeted at
            Mexican children and youth focused on high-calorie,
            low-nutrient food and beverage products, and limit or
            eliminate practices that promote these types of products.
          + In collaboration with industry, conduct research on the types
            and amount of fat that is used and needed in products.
          + Set a limit on the recommended use of dietary fats and oils,
            particularly saturated fat and trans fats, by the food,
            beverage, and restaurant industry and fast food available
            through informal establishments.
          + Regulate media marketing for food products with high content
            of refined carbohydrates and fat in regards to type of
            information, and advertising locations. For example, the
            possibility of setting strict limits in children’s
            environments, such as schools, parks, and entertainment
            centers, should be researched and discussed.

     * Evaluate the use of policy instruments such as international trade,
       subsidies, and taxes for encouraging or discouraging the production
       and consumption of certain foods to encourage the availability and
       access to healthful foods such as fruits and vegetables during all
       seasons and to reduce the consumption of less healthful foods and
       beverages.
     * Promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables and other familiar
       healthful foods and beverages through diverse media.
     * Promote a diverse media campaign supporting the consumption of
       water as a substitute for sweetened beverages (including carbonated
       soft drinks).

School Level

     * Revise the school breakfast program to ensure healthful food and
       meal options.
     * Regulate the foods and beverages offered to children and youth in
       and around the school environment.
     * Promote the enforcement of minimally established time that children
       and youth participate in physical education in both private and
       public schools, as well as physical education programs that achieve
       the recommended amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activity.
     * Encourage the organization of local and regional events to promote
       sports practice in schools.
     * Define minimal spaces at schools to ensure regular physical
       activity during physical education time and during recess.
     * Revise and improve school curricula to include obesity prevention
       and healthy lifestyle promotion.

Community Level

     * Stimulate community organization and community members’ empowerment
       to request and influence the modification of norms and environments
       aimed at achieving healthy lifestyles.
     * Explore the spectrum of available organizations to identify the
       best strategies for increasing community empowerment and awareness,
       especially among parents, of the obesity epidemic. Potential
       community organizations include parents’ societies, religious
       groups, and non-governmental organizations.

   In conclusion, Mexico is on the course of an epidemiologic and
   nutritional transition toward more sedentary lifestyles and obesogenic
   environments. The present trajectory is moving toward an increasing
   burden of obesity in children and youth with serious predictable health
   and economic burdens to the entire population and Mexican society.
   These risks must be addressed immediately with multi-level
   interventions undertaken by a variety of stakeholders in government,
   schools, and communities targeting children and youth in many settings.
   The response to the growing obesity epidemic in Mexico will require
   many years and perhaps decades to implement and to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the results. The joint U.S.–Mexico workshop, for which
   this and the companion paper from the U.S. context served as background
   for discussion, should delineate the initial steps of the strategy
   required to tackle this urgent public health problem.

   The Joint U.S.-Mexico Workshop on Preventing Obesity in Children and
   Youth of Mexican Origin was initiated by a desire to share experiences
   regarding the problem of obesity in children and youth of Mexican
   origin on both sides of the border, with a particular focus on
   potential solutions. U.S and Mexican researchers, public health
   officials, industry leaders, and policy-makers engaged in valuable
   dialogue to share perspectives, challenges, and opportunities.
   Commonalities and differences in the United States and Mexico regarding
   risk factors, potential interventions and programs, and need for all
   sectors to collaborate and make progress toward solving this serious
   public health problem were also discussed. This dialogue served as a
   basis to explore a bi-national agenda for addressing this epidemic,
   which was the ultimate goal of the workshop.

Downloading and Using eBooks from NAP

What is an eBook?

   An ebook is one of two file formats that are intended to be used with
   e-reader devices and apps such as Amazon Kindle or Apple iBooks.

Why is an eBook better than a PDF?

   A PDF is a digital representation of the print book, so while it can be
   loaded into most e-reader programs, it doesn't allow for resizable text
   or advanced, interactive functionality. The eBook is optimized for
   e-reader devices and apps, which means that it offers a much better
   digital reading experience than a PDF, including resizable text and
   interactive features (when available).

Where do I get eBook files?

   eBook files are now available for a large number of reports on the
   NAP.edu website. If an eBook is available, you'll see the option to
   purchase it on the book page.

   Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts

Description

   The growing problem of changing environmental conditions caused by
   climate destabilization is well recognized as one of the defining
   issues of our time. The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions, and
   the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate
   geoengineering has often been considered to be a "last-ditch" response
   to climate change, to be used only if climate change damage should
   produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing
   to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on
   emissions control, there is a lack of information on these ways of
   potentially intervening in the climate system.

   As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention
   discusses albedo modification - changing the fraction of incoming solar
   radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately
   modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to
   compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with
   greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo
   modification raises political and governance issues at national and
   global levels, as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention:
   Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social,
   political, and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques.

   It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it
   should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action. One
   serious concern is that such an action could be unilaterally undertaken
   by a small nation or smaller entity for its own benefit without
   international sanction and regardless of international consequences.
   Transparency in discussing this subject is critical. In the spirit of
   that transparency, Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool
   Earth was based on peer-reviewed literature and the judgments of the
   authoring committee; no new research was done as part of this study and
   all data and information used are from entirely open sources. By
   helping to bring light to this topic area, this book will help leaders
   to be far more knowledgeable about the consequences of albedo
   modification approaches before they face a decision whether or not to
   use them.

Downloading and Using eBooks from NAP

What is an eBook?

   An ebook is one of two file formats that are intended to be used with
   e-reader devices and apps such as Amazon Kindle or Apple iBooks.

Why is an eBook better than a PDF?

   A PDF is a digital representation of the print book, so while it can be
   loaded into most e-reader programs, it doesn't allow for resizable text
   or advanced, interactive functionality. The eBook is optimized for
   e-reader devices and apps, which means that it offers a much better
   digital reading experience than a PDF, including resizable text and
   interactive features (when available).

Where do I get eBook files?

   eBook files are now available for a large number of reports on the
   NAP.edu website. If an eBook is available, you'll see the option to
   purchase it on the book page.

   Developing a Research Agenda for Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable
   Sequestration

Description

   To achieve goals for climate and economic growth, “negative emissions
   technologies” (NETs) that remove and sequester carbon dioxide from the
   air will need to play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
   Unlike carbon capture and storage technologies that remove carbon
   dioxide emissions directly from large point sources such as coal power
   plants, NETs remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or
   enhance natural carbon sinks. Storing the carbon dioxide from NETs has
   the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously
   preventing an equal amount of carbon dioxide from being emitted. Recent
   analyses found that deploying NETs may be less expensive and less
   disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion
   of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation
   emissions.

   In 2015, the National Academies published Climate Intervention: Carbon
   Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration, which described and
   initially assessed NETs and sequestration technologies. This report
   acknowledged the relative paucity of research on NETs and recommended
   development of a research agenda that covers all aspects of NETs from
   fundamental science to full-scale deployment. To address this need,
   Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research
   Agenda assesses the benefits, risks, and “sustainable scale potential”
   for NETs and sequestration. This report also defines the essential
   components of a research and development program, including its
   estimated costs and potential impact.

Executive Summary

   Incineration is widely used to reduce the volume of municipal solid
   waste, to reduce the potential infectious properties and volume of
   medical waste, and to reduce the potential toxicity and volume of
   hazardous chemical and biological waste. In the United States, more
   than 100 facilities incinerate municipal solid waste, and more than
   1,600 facilities incinerate medical waste. Also, almost 200
   incinerators and industrial kiln facilities, and many industrial
   boilers and furnaces combust hazardous and nonhazardous waste.

   Whether incineration is an appropriate means of managing waste has been
   the subject of much debate in this country. A major aspect of the
   debate is the potential risk to human health that might result from the
   emission of pollutants generated by the incineration process; some of
   those pollutants have been found to cause various adverse health
   effects. Although such effects have generally been observed at much
   higher ambient concentrations than those usually produced by emissions
   from an incineration facility, questions persist about the possible
   effects of smaller amounts of pollutants from incineration facilities,
   especially when combined with the mix of pollutants emitted from other
   sources. The possible social, economic, and psychologic effects
   associated with living or working near an incineration facility also
   have been topics of concern.

   This report was prepared by the National Research Council's Committee
   on Health Effects of Waste Incineration. The committee was formed to
   assess relationships between waste incineration and human health and to
   consider specific issues related to the incineration of hazardous
   waste, municipal solid waste, and medical waste. The committee was
   asked to consider various design, siting, and operating conditions at
   waste-incineration facilities with respect to releases

   of potentially harmful pollutants to the environment. It was also asked
   to consider appropriate health-based approaches for demonstrating that
   an incineration facility meets and maintains established levels of
   health protection. Issues related to communication of information on
   waste incineration were also within the study charge. The committee was
   asked to consider types of information that should be provided to
   government officials, industry managers, and the general public to help
   them in future efforts to understand and weigh the risks associated
   with waste incineration and its alternatives. Finally, the committee
   was asked to consider factors that might affect public perceptions of
   waste incineration.

   The committee was not charged to assess risks posed by any particular
   waste-incineration facility or to compare the risks of incineration
   with risks posed by various waste-management alternatives, such as
   landfilling. The committee focused its attention on wastes that have
   reached an incineration facility—it was not asked to address the
   collection or storage of wastes at, or their transportation to, any
   incineration facility; nor was it asked to consider treatment of
   residual ash away from a facility.

WASTE-INCINERATION PROCESSES AND EMISSIONS

   The principal gaseous products of waste incineration, like other
   combustion processes, are carbon dioxide and water vapor. And, like
   many combustion processes, incineration also produces byproducts such
   as soot particles and other contaminants released in exhaust gases, and
   leaves a residue (bottom ash) of incombustible and partially combusted
   waste that must be emptied from incinerator chambers and properly
   disposed. The composition of the gas and ash byproducts is determined,
   at least in part, by the composition of the wastes fed into an
   incineration facility. This feedstream composition can be altered by
   other waste-management activities, such as reducing the amount of waste
   generated, reusing materials, and recycling waste materials for use as
   feedstocks for various manufacturing processes.

   The exhaust gases from waste incineration facilities may contain many
   potentially harmful substances, including particulate matter; oxides of
   nitrogen; oxides of sulfur; carbon monoxide; dioxins and furans;
   metals, such as lead and mercury; acid gases; volatile chlorinated
   organic compounds; and polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some pollutant
   emissions are formed, in part, by incomplete combustion that may in
   turn lead to the formation of pollutants such as dioxins and furans.
   The formation of products of incomplete combustion is governed by the
   duration of the combustion process, the extent of gas mixing in the
   combustion chamber, and the temperature of combustion. Good combustion
   efficiency depends upon maintaining the appropriate temperature,
   residence time, and turbulence in the incineration process. Optimal
   conditions in a combustion chamber must be maintained so that the gases
   rising from the chamber mix thoroughly and continuously with injected
   air; maintaining the optimal tempera-

   ture range involves burning of fuel in an auxiliary burner during
   startup, shutdown, and process upsets. The combustion chamber is
   designed to provide adequate turbulence and residence time of the
   combustion gases.

   Operation of the incinerator also affects the emission of heavy metals,
   chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen that may be present in the waste fed
   into the incinerator. Such chemicals are not destroyed during
   combustion, but are distributed among the bottom ash, fly ash, and
   released gases in proportions that depend on the characteristics of the
   metal and the combustion conditions. Mercury and its compounds, for
   example, are volatile, so most of the mercury in the waste feed is
   vaporized in the combustion chamber. In the cases of lead and cadmium,
   the distributions between the bottom ash and fly ash depend on
   operating conditions. At higher combustion-chamber temperatures, more
   of the metals can appear in the fly ash or gaseous emissions.
   Therefore, combustion conditions need to maximize the destruction of
   products of incomplete combustion and to minimize the vaporization and
   entrainment of heavy metals, especially when adequate control of
   emissions is lacking. Formation of oxides of nitrogen is promoted by
   high temperatures and the presence of nitrogen-containing wastes.

   In addition, air-pollution control devices can greatly influence
   emissions from waste-incineration facilities. For example, airborne
   particles can be controlled with electrostatic precipitators, fabric
   filters, or wet scrubbers. Hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, dioxins,
   and heavy metals can be controlled with wet scrubbers, spray-dryer
   absorbers, or dry-sorbent injection and fabric filters. Oxides of
   nitrogen can be controlled, in part, by combustion-process modification
   and ammonia or urea injection through selective catalytic or
   noncatalytic reduction. Concentrations of dioxins and mercury can be
   reduced substantially by passing the cooled flue gas through a carbon
   sorbent bed or by injecting activated carbon into the flue gas.

   With current technology, waste incinerators can be designed and
   operated to produce nearly complete combustion of the combustible
   portion of waste and to emit low amounts of the pollutants of concern
   under normal operating conditions. In addition, using well-trained
   employees can help ensure that an incinerator is operated to its
   maximal combustion efficiency and that the emission-control devices are
   operated optimally for pollutant capture or neutralization. However,
   for all types of incinerators, there is a need to be alert to
   off-normal (upset) conditions that might result in short-term emissions
   greater than those usually represented by typical operating conditions
   or by annual national averages. Such upset conditions usually occur
   during incinerator startup or shutdown or when the composition of the
   waste being burned changes sharply. Upset conditions can also be caused
   by malfunctioning equipment, operator error, poor management of the
   incineration process, or inadequate maintenance.

   Typically, emissions data have been collected from incineration
   facilities during only a small fraction of the total number of
   incinerator operating hours and generally do not include data during
   startup, shutdown, and upset condi-

   tions. Furthermore, such data are typically based on a few stack
   samples for each pollutant. The adequacy of such emissions data to
   characterize fully the contribution of incineration to ambient
   pollutant concentrations for health-effects assessments is uncertain.
   More emissions information is needed, especially for dioxins and
   furans, heavy metals, and particulate matter.

Recommendations

   Government agencies should continue to improve—or in some cases should
   begin—the process of collecting, and making readily available to the
   public, substantially more information on the following:
     * The effects of design and operating conditions on emissions and
       ash. Such information should show how specific emissions and ash
       characteristics are affected by modifying the operating conditions
       of an incinerator to maximize its combustion efficiency. It should
       also indicate the types and combinations of operating conditions
       that optimize the effectiveness of emission-control devices.
     * New combustor designs; continuous emission monitors;
       emissions-control technologies; operating practices; and techniques
       for source reduction, fuel cleaning, and fuel preparation,
       including records of demonstrated environmental performance and
       effects on emissions and ash.
     * Emission and process conditions during startup, shutdown, and upset
       conditions. Emissions testing has usually been performed under
       relatively steady-state conditions. However, the greatest emissions
       are expected to occur during startup, shutdown, and malfunctions.
       Such emissions need to be better characterized with respect to
       possible health effects. Therefore, data are needed on the level of
       emissions, the frequency of accidents and other off-normal
       performance, and the reasons for such occurrences.

ENVIRONMENTAL PATHWAYS OF HUMAN EXPOSURE

   After pollutants from an incineration facility disperse into the air,
   some people close to the facility may be exposed directly through
   inhalation or indirectly through consumption of food or water
   contaminated by deposition of the pollutants from air to soil,
   vegetation, and water. For metals and other pollutants that are very
   persistent in the environment, the potential effects may extend well
   beyond the area close to the incinerator. Persistent pollutants can be
   carried long distances from their emission sources, go through various
   chemical and physical transformations, and pass numerous times through
   soil, water, or food.

   Dioxins, furans, and mercury are examples of persistent pollutants for
   which incinerators have contributed a substantial portion of the total
   national emis-

   sions. Whereas one incinerator might contribute only a small fraction
   of the total environmental concentrations of these chemicals, the sum
   of the emissions of all the incineration facilities in a region can be
   considerable. Many older incinerators have been closed down and
   replaced by modern low-emitting units, so the relative contribution of
   incineration to the current concentrations of chemicals in the
   environment is uncertain.

   Results of environmental monitoring studies around incineration
   facilities have indicated that the specific facilities studied were not
   likely to be major contributors to local ambient concentrations of the
   substances of concern, although there are exceptions. However,
   methodological limitations of those studies do not permit general
   conclusions to be drawn about the overall contributions of waste
   incineration to environmental concentrations of those contaminants.

   Although emissions from incineration facilities can be smaller than
   emissions from other types of sources, it is important to assess
   incinerator emissions in the context of the total ambient concentration
   of pollutants in an area. In areas where the ambient concentrations are
   already close to or above environmental guidelines or standards, even
   relatively small increments can be important.

   Computational models for the environmental transport and fate of
   contaminants through air, soil, water, and food can provide useful
   information for assessing major exposure pathways for humans, but, in
   general, they are not accurate enough to provide estimates of overall
   environmental contributions from an individual facility within a factor
   of 10. The models suggest that fish consumption is the major pathway of
   human exposure to mercury, and that meats, dairy products, and fish are
   potentially the major exposure pathways for dioxins and furans. For
   assessment of persistent pollutants, there is usually a poor
   correlation between total ambient concentrations and local emissions
   from an incinerator.

Recommendations

     * Environmental assessment and management strategies for emissions
       from individual incineration facilities should include a
       regional-scale framework for assessing dispersion, persistence, and
       potential long-term impacts on human health.
     * Better material balance information—including measurements of
       source emissions to air and deposition rates to soil, water, and
       vegetation—are needed to determine the contribution of
       waste-incineration facilities to environmental concentrations of
       persistent chemicals. The variation of these emissions over time
       needs to be taken into account: for the short term to determine if
       any important emission increases occur at an incineration facility,
       and for the long term to measure changes due to the replacement of
       less-efficient incinerators with modern, lower-emitting units.

     * To facilitate evaluation of the overall contributions of
       incinerators to pollutants in the environment, estimates of
       dispersion of incinerator emissions into the environment should be
       gathered. The additional information would allow conversion of
       emissions estimates into environmental concentration estimates.
     * Government agencies should link emissions and facility-specific
       data from all incineration facilities to characterize better the
       contributions of incinerators to environmental concentrations.
       Existing databases should be linked to provide easy access to
       specific operating conditions of an incinerator, height and
       diameter of the emission stack, flow rate and temperature of the
       gases leaving the stack, local meteorological conditions,
       air-dispersion coefficients as a function of distance from a
       facility, and precise geographic location of the emission point.
       Data should be standardized for uniform reporting.

HEALTH EFFECTS

   Few epidemiologic studies have attempted to assess whether adverse
   health effects have actually occurred near individual incinerators, and
   most of them have been unable to detect any effects. The studies of
   which the committee is aware that did report finding health effects had
   shortcomings and failed to provide convincing evidence. That result is
   not surprising given the small populations typically available for
   study and the fact that such effects, if any, might occur only
   infrequently or take many years to appear. Also, factors such as
   emissions from other pollution sources and variations in human activity
   patterns often decrease the likelihood of determining a relationship
   between small contributions of pollutants from incinerators and
   observed health effects. Lack of evidence of such relationships might
   mean that adverse health effects did not occur, but it could also mean
   that such relationships might not be detectable using available methods
   and data sources.

   Pollutants emitted by incinerators that appear to have the potential to
   cause the largest health effects are particulate matter, lead, mercury,
   and dioxins and furans. However, there is wide variation in the
   contributions that incinerators can make to environmental
   concentrations of those contaminants. Although emissions from newer,
   well-run facilities are expected to contribute little to environmental
   concentrations and to health risks, the same might not be true for some
   older or poorly run facilities.

   Studies of workers at municipal solid-waste incinerators show that
   workers are at much higher risk for adverse health effects than
   individual residents in the surrounding area. In the past, incinerator
   workers have been exposed to high concentrations of dioxins and toxic
   metals, particularly lead, cadmium, and mercury.

Recommendations

     * To increase the power of epidemiologic studies to assess the health
       effects of incinerators, future multi-site studies should be
       designed to evaluate combined data from all facilities in a local
       area as well as multiple localities that contain similar
       incinerators and incinerator workers, rather than examining health
       issues separately site by site.
     * In addition to using other exposure-assessment techniques, worker
       exposures should be evaluated comprehensively through biological
       monitoring, particularly in combination with efforts to reduce
       exposures of workers during maintenance operations.
     * Assessments of health risks attributable to waste incineration
       should pay special attention to the risks that might be posed by
       particulate matter, lead, mercury, dioxins and furans.
     * Health risks attributable to emissions resulting from incinerator
       upset conditions need to be evaluated. Data are needed on the
       levels of emissions during process upsets as well as the frequency,
       severity, and causes of accidents and other off-specification
       performance to enable adequate risk assessments related to these
       factors. Such information is needed to address whether off-normal
       emissions are important with respect to possible health effects.
     * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational
       Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should continue striving to
       improve coordination of enforcement activities between the two
       agencies to protect the health of incineration workers.

REGULATION OF WASTE-INCINERATION FACILITIES

   Waste-incineration facilities are required to comply with a combination
   of federal, state, and local regulations that vary from place to place
   and time to time. EPA has proposed or has promulgated separate
   regulations for incineration of medical, hazardous, and municipal solid
   wastes to reduce emissions to values achieved by the best-controlled
   12% of incinerators. This standard is known as “maximum achievable
   control technology,” or MACT. Facilities that meet the MACT
   requirements are generally expected to have substantially lower
   emissions. The intended reduction in emissions would lower exposures
   and possible risks to populations surrounding incinerators, especially
   for particulate matter, lead, mercury, and other metals. However, the
   effects of such regulations are less apparent when emissions of the
   most-important pollutants from all incineration sources are considered
   on a regional scale. For example, the collective contribution of
   dioxins from multiple incineration sources might remain problematic
   despite MACT regulations. Because the collective effects of incin-

   erators on metropolitan or regional scales are largely unknown, it is
   uncertain whether implementation of MACT standards for incinerators
   will substantially reduce the actual risks posed by persistent
   environmental pollutants at those scales.

   Based on estimates of incinerator emissions, environmental transport
   and fate, potential total exposure, and relative toxicity of the
   individual substances inferred from studies not involving incineration,
   the committee concludes
     * Compliance with MACT regulations is expected to reduce
       substantially local population exposures, especially for
       particulate matter, lead, mercury and other metals, acidic gases,
       and acidic aerosols.
     * Substantial concerns about regional dioxin and furan exposures and
       moderate concerns about regional exposures to metals are not
       expected to be relieved by MACT regulations, because the
       regulations may not adequately reduce risks attributable to
       cumulative emissions on a regional basis.
     * Substantial concerns about workers' exposures to particulate
       matter, lead, mercury, and dioxins and furans are not expected to
       be relieved by MACT compliance, because those regulations were not
       designed to affect workers' exposures.

Recommendations

     * Technologies used in other countries for combustion, emission
       control, continuous emission monitoring, and public dissemination
       of information, as well as optimum operating practices, should be
       actively studied and considered for adoption in the United States.
     * All regulated medical-waste incinerators and municipal solid-waste
       combustors should have uniform limits for each pollutant,
       irrespective of plant size, design, age, or feedstock, as is the
       case for hazardous-waste combustors. The same technology for
       air-pollution control is applicable to small and large facilities.
       Allowing less-stringent limitations for some designs or sizes is
       inconsistent with the principle of minimizing risks of health
       effects.
     * Government agencies should encourage research, development, and
       demonstration of continuous emission monitors (CEMs), dissemination
       technologies, and computer programs that automatically analyze,
       summarize, and report CEM data. In addition to the CEMs already
       required in municipal solid waste incinerator rules, requirement of
       CEMs for hydrochloric acid and particulate-matter should be
       considered on such incinerators. Also, as soon as a mercury monitor
       that measures ionic and metallic forms of mercury emissions has
       been proven reliable, EPA should consider its use for domestic
       incinerators. The same approach should be used for

          other monitors, including those for other heavy metals and
          dioxins and furans. EPA should also explore the utility of
          technologies such as direct electronic transmission and display
          to disseminate CEM data to regulatory authorities and the
          public. Providing such data and data summaries on the Internet
          should be considered.

     * In future regulatory decision-making, greater consideration should
       be given to emission levels achieved in actual performance of
       incinerators, including process upset conditions (described
       earlier). In monitoring for compliance or other purposes, data
       generated during the intervals in which a facility is in startup,
       shutdown, and upset conditions should be included in the hourly
       emission data recorded and published. It is during those times that
       the highest emissions may occur, and omitting them systematically
       from monitoring data records does not allow for a full
       characterization of the actual emissions from an incineration
       facility.

SOCIAL ISSUES AND COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS

   In addition to possible physical-health effects, a waste-incineration
   facility may have other effects on individuals, groups, or the entire
   population in the surrounding area. The effects might be economic (such
   as job creation or decrease in property values), psychological (such as
   stress or stigma), or social (such as community factionalization or
   unity). However, there is little rigorous information on those impacts
   of waste-incineration facilities.

   Citizen concerns need to be heard and understood. Conflicts can
   increase the time and expense of conducting waste incinerators and
   other facilities that might be potentially beneficial to society.
   Opposition to the facilities also can indicate that important concerns
   are not being addressed adequately.

   Much public opposition to waste incineration might be due to a lack of
   understanding of the relative health risks posed by incineration in
   comparison with other waste-management methods. But health is not the
   only issue, and the differences between expert and public perceptions
   are not due merely to differences in information and understanding;
   they can also be due to differences in social values. People's
   perceptions are often extraordinarily resistant to change, in part
   because they reflect underlying values. Efforts that ignore or try to
   change these perceptions radically are likely to fail. Risk
   communication should accept as legitimate the perceptions and concerns
   of various members of the public and involve them in consultative,
   participatory processes. Not only do members of the public have a right
   and responsibility to be involved in the assessment and management of
   hazards in their communities, but such involvement might result in
   improved assessments and management strategies.

   Developing effective participatory programs is very difficult, but some
   general principles are beginning to emerge. The process of public
   involvement should be open, inclusive, and substantive, and members of
   the public in an

   affected area should be involved early and often. Major concerns are
   likely to include issues of safety, compensation, and local oversight
   and control. Satisfying the public's need for information on
   incinerator safety requires continual assessment and demonstration of
   regulatory compliance with existing standards.

Recommendations

     * The social, psychological, and economic effects of proposed and
       existing waste incineration facilities should be assessed, and
       mitigation of or compensation for such effects should be considered
       where appropriate.
     * The boundaries of an area potentially affected by a waste
       incinerator should not be defined at the outset by a particular
       community's political boundaries or jurisdiction. Instead, the
       assessment area should be based on the geographic extent over which
       various effects could reasonably occur. Such an approach permits a
       more-accurate analysis of the impacts. It also permits a better
       understanding of problems that might arise in connection with
       information exchange among all persons involved with, or affected
       by, decision-making concerning the facility.
     * Proponents of an incineration facility should assume, in dealing
       with local communities, that they (the proponents) should make the
       case for a new or expanded facility, especially if a waste
       combustor is not used solely within a manufacturing facility to
       incinerate waste on site.
     * If a new or expanded facility is contemplated, local citizens might
       consider conducting their own assessments of the proposed facility
       and its effects through various approaches, including, for example,
       hiring independent consultants that members of the community trust,
       seeking technical-assistance grants from the government, or finding
       technical advisers who are acceptable to both sides.
     * Particular attention should be paid to equity issues when a
       facility is to be placed in a community that is already
       experiencing disproportionate health, environmental, or
       socioeconomic burdens.
     * Government agencies should improve—or in some cases begin—to
       collect and make readily available, information on site-specific
       and large-scale empirical research on possible socioeconomic
       impacts of waste-incineration facilities on their host areas. To
       the extent practicable, efforts should be expanded to gather such
       information routinely before and during operation of incineration
       facilities that have the potential to have more than a minor
       socioeconomic impact.

UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY

   Incineration facilities vary with regard to types of waste incinerated,
   operating practices, allowable magnitudes of emission, emission-control
   technologies,

   types of substances emitted, environmental conditions, proximity to
   other sources of contaminants, and frequency of process upsets. The
   people who might be exposed to the contaminants are likely to differ in
   their susceptibilities and activity patterns. Some uncertainties are
   specific to waste incineration, and some are inherent in any activity
   that releases contaminants into the environment.

   Some of the uncertainties and variability can be reduced or better
   accounted for; others will remain intractable. The most-effective
   decisions concerning the siting, design, operation, and regulation of
   incineration facilities are the ones that take uncertainty and
   variability fully into account.

Recommendations

     * Incinerator risk assessments should include the following
       components of uncertainty and variability analyses
          + An estimate of the variability and uncertainty distributions
            of all input values and their effects on final estimates.
          + A sensitivity analysis to assess how model predictions are
            related to variations in input data.
          + Variance-propagation models that show how the variability and
            uncertainty of final results are tied to the uncertainties and
            variabilities associated with the various models, their
            inputs, and assumptions used throughout the risk assessment.

   The committee's evaluation of waste incineration and public health was
   substantially impaired by the lack of available compilations of the
   ambient concentrations of pollutants resulting from incinerator
   emissions. In addition, large variabilities and uncertainties
   associated with risk-assessment predictions often limit the ability to
   define risks posed by incinerators.

   Incineration has been used widely for waste disposal, including
   household, hazardous, and medical waste--but there is increasing public
   concern over the benefits of combusting the waste versus the health
   risk from pollutants emitted during combustion. Waste Incineration and
   Public Health informs the emerging debate with the most up-to-date
   information available on incineration, pollution, and human
   health--along with expert conclusions and recommendations for further
   research and improvement of such areas as risk communication. The
   committee provides details on:
     * Processes involved in incineration and how contaminants are
       released.
     * Environmental dynamics of contaminants and routes of human
       exposure.
     * Tools and approaches for assessing possible human health effects.
     * Scientific concerns pertinent to future regulatory actions.

   The book also examines some of the social, psychological, and economic
   factors that affect the communities where incineration takes place and
   addresses the problem of uncertainty and variation in predicting the
   health effects of incineration processes.

INTRODUCTION

   Mexico is among many countries that have experienced a rapid increase
   over the past two decades in the proportion of children and adolescents
   with excessive weight. In the decade between the First (1988) and
   Second (1999) National Nutrition Surveys, there was an increase in the
   prevalence of Mexican children ages 2–4 years who were either obese or
   at risk for obesity,^1 rising from 21.9 percent to 28.7 percent. This
   is the only age group in children for which national trend data are
   available. For older Mexican children, the lack of national trend data
   limits the evaluation of obesity trends during that decade. However,
   data from the Second National Nutrition Survey show equally alarming
   evidence of a growing obesity epidemic in children and youth. Based on
   the age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) charts developed by
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2000
   (Kuczmarski et al., 2000), 21.1 percent of Mexican children ages 6–11
   years have a BMI equal to or greater than the 85th percentile and are
   considered to be obese (8.8 percent) or at risk for obesity (12.3
   percent). Among girls ages 12–19 years, 22.3 percent have a BMI

   ^1

   At risk for obesity and obesity are defined as having a BMI equal to or
   greater than the 85th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of the age-
   and gender-specific BMI charts developed by the CDC in 2000 (Kuczmarski
   et al., 2000).

   equal to or greater than the 85th percentile and are either obese (5.7
   percent) or at risk for obesity (16.6 percent).

   These data reflect an evolving obesity epidemic, representing an
   enormous burden for the public health and health care systems in
   Mexico. The association between childhood obesity and many health
   risks, in both children and adults, has been consistently found. The
   major public health impact is the association of childhood obesity with
   chronic disease risks in adulthood, especially overweight and obesity,
   type 2 diabetes, hypertension, asthma, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular
   diseases (CVD), and certain cancers. Excessive weight at younger ages
   has also been associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes such as low
   self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function,
   especially in adolescents, although findings have not always been
   consistent (Swallen et al., 2005). However, research is currently not
   available to demonstrate this association in Mexican children and
   youth.

   Nutrition-related chronic diseases represent a serious public health
   problem for the Mexican population. According to the Organization for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2005 Health Report, one
   quarter (24.2 percent) of the Mexican adult population is classified as
   obese (OECD, 2005). Data from the most recent National Health Survey
   (2000) showed that nearly 8 percent of all Mexican adults over 20 years
   of age have type 2 diabetes and approximately 30 percent have
   hypertension (Olaiz et al., 2003). Moreover, type 2 diabetes and CVD
   are the leading causes of death in the adult Mexican population, and
   some small studies suggest an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes
   and glucose intolerance at younger ages (Cruz et al., 2004;
   Rodríguez-Moran et al., 2004).

   Although there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of the economic
   impact of obesity in Mexico, a recent analysis estimated an
   attributable cost of diabetes for the public health sector of
   approximately $317 million U.S. dollars for the year 2005, almost
   equally distributed between direct and indirect costs (Arredondo and
   Zuñiga, 2004). The increasing incidence of obesity at younger ages and
   the scarce public resources in the country will considerably aggravate
   these economic projections.

   As in many developing countries, the Mexican population is in the
   process of an epidemiologic transition and is experiencing a double
   disease burden. Child mortality rates and the incidence of infectious
   diseases have decreased. However, statistics show a significant
   increase in obesity and related chronic diseases such as diabetes,
   hypertension, and CVD in adults. High rates of malnutrition and related
   problems are still observed, especially among sub-populations of
   Mexican children. This paradoxical situation is the result of multiple
   factors, partly attributed to the uneven development among different
   segments of the population and increased socioeconomic inequalities
   (Uauy et al., 2001). A closely related phenom-

   enon that the Mexican population has experienced over the past few
   decades is a nutritional transition, that is a shift in the overall
   structure of dietary patterns and a reduction in energy expenditure.
   This transition is affecting most of the population, and has been
   proposed that it is the main driving force of the obesity epidemic and
   related chronic conditions in developing countries (Popkin, 2001).

   Given the concern over the growing prevalence of obesity and its
   impact, the U.S. Congress directed the CDC in 2002 to request that the
   Institute of Medicine (IOM) develop an action plan targeted to prevent
   obesity in U.S. children and youth. The IOM convened a
   multidisciplinary committee to develop a prevention-focused action
   plan. In 2004, the committee released the report Preventing Childhood
   Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005), which proposed a set of
   recommendations for a variety of sectors and stakeholders that, when
   implemented together, would catalyze synergistic actions to effectively
   prevent the large majority of children and youth in the United States
   from becoming obese and facilitate the adoption of healthier
   lifestyles. By making childhood obesity a national priority, this set
   of recommendations calls on coordinated actions among the government,
   industry, media, community organizations, schools, and families that
   together will develop a broad-based public health strategy needed to
   effectively halt and decrease this growing epidemic (IOM, 2005).

   Are these recommendations applicable to Mexican–American and Mexican
   children and youth? Are these recommendations applicable to the
   particular public health challenges faced by Mexico? Is there any
   benefit to developing a common binational obesity prevention agenda or
   strategy? These are the main questions that stimulated the IOM to
   sponsor a joint U.S.–Mexico workshop—in collaboration with the National
   Institute of Public Health in Mexico (INSP) and supported by Kaiser
   Permanente—that will focus on exploring a binational approach to
   obesity prevention and the adaptation of the IOM report recommendations
   to Mexican children and youth living in the United States and in
   Mexico. The purpose of this paper is to review the factors that
   contribute to obesity in Mexican children and adolescents, provide an
   overview of current programs addressing this problem, and propose a set
   of actions that may offer the greatest potential for success in
   preventing and controlling the epidemic. A companion paper, authored by
   U.S. colleagues, will address obesity trends and determinants in
   Mexican–American children and youth (Trowbridge and Mendoza, 2007) and
   provide a complementary view to the issues presented in this paper.

   Based on an ecologic perspective, several components and their degrees
   of influence are context specific. For instance, the acceptance and
   understanding of “healthy behavior” recommendations are linked closely
   to cultural values that could be specific for each ethnic group. Also,
   given that

   most of the recommendations imply actions at different normative
   levels, there are substantial differences in the legal, economic, and
   political contexts that need to be considered carefully in the use of
   the IOM report model to develop recommendations for Mexican children
   and youth living on both sides of the U.S.–Mexico border.

   Approaching obesity prevention among Mexican children and youth as a
   binational problem could have many advantages. Given the strong link
   between the population in Mexico and the one that has migrated to the
   United States, common cultural perceptions and values can be explored
   as a combined effort to design culturally acceptable recommendations
   and to define research priorities. Moreover, the permanent
   relationship, including remittances and transfer of commodities between
   U.S. migrant workers and their families, might allow the development of
   coordinated strategies that could impact not only the population living
   at the border (characterized by a high mobilization across countries)
   but also the population living in the remote areas (especially the
   rural areas) of Mexico, where most migrants trace their family roots.
   Finally, the obesity burden, on one hand, and the evidence of effective
   programs in the United States, on the other, can potentially improve
   advocacy efforts in Mexico and vice versa. Therefore, if coordination
   between countries can be fostered, progress toward effective preventive
   interventions will be accelerated with benefits and impacts on both
   sides of the U.S.–Mexico border.

DEFINING THE PROBLEM

Definition and Measurement of Obesity

   BMI, which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in
   squared meters (kg/m^2), is a useful indirect measurement of body fat
   and unhealthy weight in children ages 2 years and older and adults. It
   is often used as a screening tool to identify individuals who are obese
   and those at risk for obesity because the measurements of height and
   weight are easily obtained compared with skinfold thickness
   measurements and other complex procedures that require more training
   and standardization. BMI is one of the best indicators of body fat,
   which is proposed as the cause component of the health consequences
   associated with obesity (Mei et al., 2002). Indeed, BMI has been
   associated consistently with several risk factors, even among children
   and adolescents. Preliminary results of the association between BMI and
   chronic disease risk factors among Mexican adolescents based on the
   National Health Survey (2000) are consistent with analyses from other
   countries in which CVD risk factors show a dose–response relationship
   with BMI categories, whereby the normal-weight category shows the
   lowest risk profile and the obesity category shows the highest risk

   file (Villalpando et al., in press) (Figure B-1). BMI has certain
   disadvantages. It has been suggested that other indicators, such as
   waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or skinfold thickness
   measurements, could have a stronger association with metabolic
   abnormalities. However, these measurements are not usually obtained for
   children and youth in health clinics and school systems as readily as
   weight and height, and are usually not known by parents; thus, BMI is
   the measurement most commonly used.

   Although there may be a need to develop ethnic-specific definitions for
   overweight and obesity, the cut-off points used to define overweight (a
   BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m^2) and obesity (a BMI equal to or greater
   that 30 kg/m^2) for adults are widely accepted. However, given that BMI
   changes with children’s growth and development, it is more appropriate
   to use age-and gender-specific BMI charts to define obesity and at risk
   for obesity in children and adolescents. For consistency with the IOM
   report Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005)
   and with the companion paper examining the factors contributing to
   obesity in Mexican– American children and youth, this paper uses the
   CDC BMI charts established in 2000 to define obesity and being at-risk
   for obesity for children

   and adolescents between the ages of 2–19 years. According to this
   reference, children and adolescents with a BMI equal to or greater than
   the 95th percentile are considered obese, and those with a BMI between
   the 85th and 95th percentiles are considered to be at risk for obesity
   (IOM, 2005; Kuczmarski et al., 2000). In the absence of a reference
   population or cut-off points specific for the Mexican population, the
   authors conclude that the CDC BMI charts are the best available for
   children and adolescents 2–19 years. In the future, the recently
   released WHO Child Growth Standards, developed using data collected by
   the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study
   that provide new guidelines for assessing obesity in children ages 0–5
   years (WHO, 2006a) could also be used for that age range.

Obesity Prevalence and Trends in Children and Youth in Mexico

   The only national survey that included anthropometric measurements of
   school-aged children was the Second National Nutrition Survey (Rivera
   et al., 2001), conducted by the National Institute of Public Health of
   Mexico between October 1998 and March 1999. The Third National
   Nutrition Survey 2006 is currently in progress and will provide further
   data on obesity trends in children, youth, and adults throughout the
   entire country.

   The results of the Second National Nutrition Survey were based on a
   national probabilistic sample of 17,944 households. The sampling
   methodology and response rates are described in detail elsewhere
   (Resano-Pérez et al., 2003). The resulting sample is representative at
   the national level of urban (≥ 2,500 people) and rural (< 2,500 people)
   sites and of four geographic regions: north (the wealthiest region),
   south (the poorest region), Mexico City [a large urban center with the
   greatest socioeconomic status (SES) contrasts], and central (including
   states that are generally between the north and the south with respect
   to SES). The study population included children younger than 5 years of
   age (n = 8,011), school-aged children ages 5–11 years (n = 11,415), and
   women ages 12–49 years (n = 18,311). The sample represented about 10.6
   million children 4 years of age or younger and 15.6 million children
   ages 5–11 years. In addition to these age ranges, which were employed
   in the First and Second Mexican National Nutrition Survey and are used
   in previous publications, for consistency with the IOM report (IOM,

   The national prevalence of children at risk for obesity and obese by
   age, geographic region, and sociodemographic characteristics derived
   from the National Nutrition Survey 1999 are illustrated in Table B-1.
   In infants younger than 2 years, the national prevalence of children at
   risk for obesity [defined as the percent > +2 SD of the WHO/National
   Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/CDC reference population] is 5.84
   percent. For children ages 2–5 years, the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥
   95th percentile of the age-and gender-specific CDC BMI charts) was 10.4
   percent, and the prevalence of children at risk for obesity (BMI
   between the 85th and 95th percentile of the CDC BMI charts) was 17.1
   percent for a total of 27.5 percent of children in this age category
   who are either at risk or obese. Both groups present higher prevalence
   in the north compared with the other regions, and for 2– 5-year-olds,
   the prevalence was higher in urban versus rural areas and in high
   versus low SES strata.

   The only age category for which there are available data from two
   national surveys (1988 and 1999), allowing for an evaluation of obesity
   trends, is children younger than 5 years of age. Figure B-2 shows the
   trend in the proportion of children ages 2–4 years that were over the
   85th percentile of the reference population. An increase was evident at
   the national level (31 percent, from 21.9 percent to 28.7 percent) and
   in each of the four regions represented in the survey; this increase
   was especially notable in the north (with the highest SES), which
   showed an estimated increase over 50 percent (from 20.8 percent to 31.8
   percent) in the prevalence of obesity or at risk for obesity (> 85th
   percentile) over the 11-year period. This increment was mainly driven
   by the proportion of children who were at risk for obesity rather than
   the obesity category.

   Among Mexican children ages 6–11 years, 8.8 percent were classified as
   obese (> 95th percentile) and 12.3 percent were classified as at risk
   for obesity (> 85th percentile) at the national level. The magnitude of
   the regional prevalence followed the children’s SES status. The highest
   prevalence of obesity was found in the north (12.7 percent), followed
   by Mexico City (11.4 percent), the central region (8.8 percent), and
   the south (5.5 percent). The prevalence was higher in those living in
   urban (11 percent) versus rural areas (3.4 percent), in children whose
   mothers had a higher level of formal education (e.g., more than high
   school = 13.2 percent, high school = 11.8 percent, primary school = 7.5
   percent, without formal education = 4.8 percent), and in the
   non-indigenous population (9.4 percent versus 3.4 percent). The
   prevalence of children at risk of obesity was higher than for the
   obesity category following the same pattern. The relatively larger
   prevalence of unhealthy weight in wealthier subpopulations is in
   contrast with the very small differences in prevalence of unhealthy
   weight found among the same subpopulations for adult women (Rivera et
   al., 2002).

Undernutrition and Catch-Up Growth in Children and Youth in Mexico

   The coexistence of under- and overnutrition is a characteristic of the
   Mexican population, particularly among children and young women. Along
   with the high prevalence of unhealthy weight in children, the
   prevalence of stunting ,^2 anemia, and micronutrient deficiencies
   remain public health concerns. Stunting continues to be an important
   public health problem in children younger than 5 years of age while
   wasting^3 is no longer a widespread problem, decreasing from a national
   prevalence of 6 percent in 1988 to a prevalence of 2 percent in 1999.
   At the national level, stunting occurred in almost one of every five
   children younger than 5 years of age (17.7 percent) while wasting
   occurred in only 2 percent. The mean height-for-age z-score in this age
   group was −0.8 ± 1.3 while the mean weight-for-height z-score was +0.2
   ± 1.1. Stunting occurs predominantly during the first two years of
   life. The prevalence increases almost threefold between the first and
   the second years of life (from about 8 percent to 22 percent) and
   remains at about 20 percent up to 4 years of age. From 5–11 years, the
   percent of

   ^2

   Stunting is defined as low height for age (< 2 SD of the WHO/NCHS/CDC
   reference population).

   ^3

   Wasting is defined as low weight for age (< 2 SD of the WHO/NCHS/CDC
   reference population).

   stunting in children was 16.1 percent, which is mainly the result of
   stunting during early childhood. The long-term effects of stunting on
   height are evident in the adult population. On average, Mexican adult
   women are short (e.g., the mean height of women 12–49 years of age is
   152.9 cm).

   Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in most age groups
   (Villalpando et al., 2003a, b, c). More than one in every four children
   younger than 5 years (27.2 percent) are anemic, and between one-quarter
   to one-half have one or more micronutrient deficiencies. The prevalence
   of iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiencies are at approximately 52
   percent, 33 percent, and 27 percent, respectively. Additionally, more
   than 25 percent of children have serum ascorbic acid concentrations
   indicative of low dietary intake of vitamin C. Some micronutrient
   deficiencies occur predominantly at younger ages. Anemia rates peak in
   the second year of life, when almost half of all children are affected,
   but decrease to about 17 percent prevalence at 4 years of age. Iron
   deficiency affects about two-thirds of all children between 1 and 2
   years of age and less than 50 percent between 3 and 4 years of age.

   The prevalence of anemia in children ages 5–11 years was 19.5 percent;
   it was slightly higher in rural (21.9 percent) than urban (18.3
   percent) areas, higher in indigenous (24 percent) than non-indigenous
   (18 percent) children, and much lower in Mexico City (11 percent) than
   in other regions (18 percent to 24 percent). The micronutrient with the
   highest deficiency prevalence was iron (36 percent), followed by
   vitamin C (30 percent), vitamin A and zinc (about 20 percent), and
   folic acid (about 10 percent). Urban areas had a much lower prevalence
   of iron and zinc deficiencies (38.2 percent and 18.2 percent,
   respectively) than rural areas (48.3 percent and 40 percent,
   respectively) (Rivera and Sepúlveda-Amor, 2003).

   As mentioned earlier, stunting is a public health problem in Mexico,
   but the prevalence of wasting is within expected values for a healthy
   population. Results from the Second National Nutrition Survey (Rivera
   et al., 2001) show that the mean height-for-age z-score is −0.4 from
   0–11 months, drops to −1.1 at 12–23 months, and remains at around −1.0
   up to 59 months of age. The prevalence of stunting is 8.5 percent from
   0–11 months of age, rises sharply to 21.8 percent at 12–23 months, and
   remains at about that level until 4 years of age. These data indicate
   that stunting occurs from birth to 23 months of age and that there is
   no substantial catch-up growth from 23 to 59 months. At the end of the
   preschool period, the height of children is about 1 SD below the mean
   value of the reference population, and about 20 percent of children
   have heights in the lower extreme (< –2 SD) of the reference
   distribution. In contrast, the mean weight-for-height z-score remains
   between +0.1 and +0.3 from birth to 59 months of age, indicating that
   weight relative to height is slightly above the value expected

   given the height of the population. Moreover, wasting remains below 3.5
   percent from birth to 59 months.

   For older children important catch-up growth is not observed either,
   especially in low socioeconomic conditions. Data from the Second
   National Nutrition Survey 1999 showed that children ages 2–9 years from
   the upper 25 percent of the SES index have higher values of
   height-for-age relative to the rest of the population (average
   differences 3.8 cm in girls and 4.1 cm in boys) but are still shorter
   than the WHO/NCHS/CDC reference (average differences 1.6 cm in girls
   and 1.8 cm in boys) (Figures B-3 and B-4) (Monterrubio-Flores, 2006).
   Thus, whereas the prevalence of stunting for 5–11-year-old children is
   about 16 percent, the prevalence of BMI > 85th percentile of the 2000
   CDC BMI charts in this age category ranges from 19 percent to 35
   percent (average = 25.7 percent) in boys and from 21 percent to 43
   percent (average = 28.6 percent) in girls (Rivera et al., 2001). This
   contrast indicates that even though linear catch-up growth is not
   achieved, weight relative to height, i.e., BMI, is high.

   The aforementioned data show that childhood obesity represents a
   growing problem in Mexican society, a problem that will add an
   additional burden to a health care system already preoccupied and
   overwhelmed by public health issues related to poverty and
   underdevelopment. When comparing prevalence of under- and overnutrition
   in the populations of the United States and Mexico, two important
   differences emerge. First, the Mexican data clearly reflect a dual
   burden—the problem of undernutrition (especially stunting) and
   micronutrient deficiencies are unsolved and therefore require ongoing
   public health strategies and monitoring systems for addressing the
   problem. In contrast, these problems are not widespread in the American
   population and thus are not public health priorities. Second, the
   prevalence of childhood obesity in Mexico is higher among wealthier
   groups, whereas in the United States, the populations at greatest risk
   for

   obesity are ethnic minorities (e.g., African Americans, Hispanic
   Americans, American Indians) and lower SES families. Interestingly,
   this latter difference does not occur in the Mexican adult population,
   in which obesity is much more homogeneous among SES groups. This
   difference in the distribution of obesity among SES groups between
   children and adults may be related to low SES households providing
   environments that are more prone to encourage infections and
   malnutrition, especially among young children. These differences should
   be considered when formulating recommendations to prevent obesity in
   children and adolescents in Mexicans living in Mexico and those living
   in the United States.

FACTORS INFLUENCING CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT OBESITY

   In order to define a set of recommendations for preventing obesity
   among Mexican children and youth, the relative contribution of
   different determinants driving the problem must be examined. Although
   several scientific observations have built strong evidence on the
   biological and socioeconomic determinants of obesity, the relative
   contribution of these factors is context specific. This section
   contains an analysis and description, based on the best available
   evidence, of the relative weight of potential determinants in the
   Mexican context.

   Using an ecologic framework to understand the determinants of obesity,
   it is clear that several factors at different levels interact to
   explain energy imbalance, which is the direct cause of obesity. The
   next section reviews the relative contribution of the two main factors
   related to energy balance—energy intake versus energy expenditure—and
   explores the social and cultural factors influencing them in the
   Mexican context. The authors use available evidence to describe how the
   environment has changed for Mexican children and youth over the last
   few decades toward an “obesogenic” environment, understood as an
   environment that may promote obesity and encourage the expression of an
   individual’s predisposition to gain weight.

Energy Balance and Individual Factors

   Obesity can be viewed as a problem of a positive energy balance—in
   other words, an excess energy intake relative to a given energy
   expenditure sustained over time. Even a minor energy imbalance over
   time can result in the accumulation of excess body fat. During
   childhood and adolescence, adequate balance should be kept in order to
   allow normal growth. When energy intake exceeds expenditures, including
   the requirement for normal growth and development, then body fat
   accumulates and the risk of obesity

   increases. Dietary intake represents the energy intake side of the
   energy balance equation, while energy expenditure has several
   components—resting metabolic rate, adaptive thermogenesis, the
   thermogenic effect of food, and physical activity (Horton, 1983).

   In addition to energy intake, other factors, including genetics, can
   explain the variability between populations in linear growth. However,
   there is consensus that the variability in linear growth across regions
   is due more to social, demographic, and economic factors than to
   genetics, at least among preschool children (Habicht et al., 1974). In
   an international comparison using the WHO global database on child
   growth and a database of national factors, Frongillo et al. (1997)
   concluded that most national variability of stunting and wasting among
   preschool children was explained by national factors and geographic
   region where higher energy availability, female literacy, and gross
   product were the most important associated factors. The genetic
   contribution to linear growth after puberty remains unknown.

   In the last few decades, extensive research has focused on the search
   for a genetic component in the etiology of obesity, and consequently
   some evidence on the role of genes in the obesity etiology has been
   documented (Snyder et al., 2004; Chagnon et al., 2000; Oksanen et al.,
   1997; Rosenbaum and Leibel, 1998). According to the “thrifty genotype”
   hypothesis, originally proposed in the sixties by James Neel (1962),
   Indian ancestry could be a genetic risk factor for metabolic syndrome
   features, including obesity; the hypothesis could partially explain the
   individual predisposition observed in highly admixed populations such
   as Mexicans. An analysis among Mexican Americans in San Antonio, Texas,
   showed that diabetes risk augments as the Native-American admixture
   increases estimated from skin color measurements (Gardner et al.,
   1984). Recently, the use of ancestral indicator markers has been
   proposed as an alternative methodology to evaluate this hypothesis and
   for genetic mapping purposes, although its effectiveness remains to be
   proven (Fernandez and Shiver, 2004). However, for the moment there has
   not been a gene or even a unique genomic region associated consistently
   with obesity risk. More importantly, the fact that the observed
   worldwide trends in obesity cannot be explained by modification on the
   genetic pool of populations suggests a minor role of the genetic
   component in the current obesity epidemic. Moreover, as a
   non-modifiable factor, the contribution of genetic factors in designing
   effective obesity preventive strategies may have a minor role when
   compared to environmental and behavioral factors.

   Another proposed factor that may increase individual susceptibility to
   obesity and related chronic diseases such as CVD and diabetes, other
   than genetic susceptibility, is malnutrition in early life, especially
   low birth weight (LBW) and stunting before the age of 3 years
   (Caballero, 2001). The in-

   creasing prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases affecting more
   people at younger ages in developing countries than in the developed
   world (WHO, 2006b) may suggest an extra vulnerability of populations in
   epidemiologic transition, such as the Mexican people. If nutritional
   insults in early life confer this extra vulnerability, then the results
   of combating undernutrition in early life (gestation and the first 2–3
   years of life) will have double benefits—adequate nutritional policies
   will affect not only the undernutrition-related problem but also the
   increasing epidemic of chronic diseases.

   After observing an association of LBW and low height at 1 year of age
   with hypertension and other CVD, Barker (1992) proposed the fetal
   origin of disease hypothesis, later known as thrifty phenotype
   hypothesis, as an alternative to the thrifty genotype hypothesis
   previously described (Hales and Barker, 2001). This hypothesis (called
   “programming hypothesis”) suggests that poor fetal or early life
   nutrition causes an adaptation process that increases the capacity to
   store energy, and thus may program future propensity to obesity,
   diabetes, and CVD. Since then, several studies (mainly in developed
   countries) have tried to test this hypothesis with inconclusive
   results. The association between LBW or short stature during early life
   and the risk for diabetes and hypertension has been observed in several
   populations (Simmons, 2005). However, other studies have failed to
   observe the same association (Stern et al., 2000; Lucas et al., 1999).
   The size of the effect and its relative impact of the programming
   hypothesis on the high prevalence of these diseases in developing
   countries remain controversial.

   In terms of the risk of developing obesity in adulthood, the impact of
   fetal or postnatal growth retardation remains unclear. Large cohort
   studies such as the Nurses’ Health Study have shown a J-shape in the
   association of birth weight and adult obesity, with both LBW as well as
   high birth weight showing an increased risk relative to normal birth
   weight (5.6–7 pounds, equivalent to 2.5–3.8 kg) (Rich-Edwards et al.,
   1999). The impact of postnatal growth retardation on the risk of
   obesity is less clear. For instance, the study—which because of its
   natural design has been recognized as quasi-experimental—of records on
   the Dutch famine during World War II has shown that the prevalence of
   adult obesity was higher among those exposed to famine during the first
   two trimesters of pregnancy than among those exposed during the last
   trimester and early infancy. This last group had an even lower
   prevalence of obesity than those who were not exposed to the famine
   (Stein et al., 1995).

   One of the reasons for the inconsistency of the results may be the fact

   these studies have shown that LBW and stunting are not risk factors per

   may be expressed only among subjects who move from a scarcity to an
   abundance of energy intake. Studies characterized by their nutritional
   transition with clear modifications in dietary patterns and lifestyle
   are needed from developing countries to support or reject this
   hypothesis. However, analysis of a Guatemalan population showed that
   fetal programming might have a minor role at least for CVD risk among
   adults (Stein et al., 2002.)

   Although the programming hypothesis is still controversial, while new
   evidence from developing countries arises the potential contribution of
   LBW and short stature during the first years of life in the definition
   of preventive strategies should be considered, especially in Mexico
   where stunting remains as a prevalent problem. In contrast to the
   genetic component information, the basis of programming theory could be
   modified in just one generation if researchers succeed in controlling
   undernutrition during early life. This implies investing in nutrition
   promotion programs in early life as a potential strategy for obesity
   prevention.

Levels of Physical Activity and Inactivity

   Although there is limited information on levels and trends of time
   dedicated to physical activity and inactivity in Mexican children and
   youth, the available information indicates a tendency to sedentary
   lifestyles. In a study conducted on children and youth ages 9–16 years
   in low- and middle-income schools in the Mexico City area, they devoted
   an average of 4.1 hours/day to total video viewing (representing total
   leisure screen time except computer use) and only 1.8 hours/day to
   moderate or vigorous physical activity. Boys reported more television
   viewing and time spent in physical activity than girls (Figure B-5)
   (Hernandez et al., 1999).

   Another study conducted using a similar methodology with youth and
   young adults ages 11–24 years in the state of Morelos, Mexico, found
   results that also suggest a sedentary lifestyle. In this case,
   adolescent boys and young men reported significantly more time
   dedicated to moderate and vigorous physical activities than girls and
   young women. Boys spent more time playing videogames [3.2 (SD 2.4)
   hours daily], than watching television [2.7 (SD 1.9) hours daily],
   while adolescent girls and young women spent 2.6 (SD 2.5) hours daily
   using VCR or videogames and 2.8 (SD 1.9) hours daily watching
   television. Significant differences in the mean daily screen
   time—defined as total hours per day watching television, videogames, or
   VCR—were observed by age, type of community, SES, and medical insurance
   in both adolescent boys and girls and young adult men and women.
   Adolescent girls who reported that they were dieting to lose weight had
   significantly less screen time exposure than girls who wanted to gain
   weight. Mean screen time significantly increased with the level of
   urbanization of the community, and, in girls and young women, screen
   time increased with

   increasing SES (p < 0.01) (Lajous M; personal communication; August
   2004; Cancun, Mexico). A study using data from the Second National
   Nutrition Survey (1999) found that adolescent girls and women ages
   12–49 years dedicated an average of 45 minutes/day to physically active
   sports and 3.64 hours/day to television viewing. Thirty-four percent of
   the adolescent girls and young women ages 12–20 years old reported that
   they practiced sports regularly, and they had higher odds of practicing
   sports than women ages 31–49 years old (Hernandez et al., 2003).

   The association between television viewing and obesity (as measured by
   BMI levels) has been documented (Gortmaker et al., 1996; Robinson,
   2001). This association also was found in Mexico in the studies
   mentioned previously. In the study conducted with children in Mexico
   City, after adjustments for other covariates such as parental obesity,
   SES, age, and gender, children who spent more than 3.1 hours/day
   viewing television programs were 1.69 times more likely to be obese or
   at risk for obesity than children who viewed television programs less
   than 1 hour/day. On the other hand, children who engaged in physical
   activity less than 1 hour/day were 1.6 times more likely to be obese or
   at risk for obesity than children who engaged in physical activity more
   than 2.5 hours/day. When analyzing the associations between television
   program viewing, physical activity, and being obese or at risk for
   obesity, similar associations were found (Table B-2) (Hernandez et al.,
   1999). There were related findings in the study conducted with youth in
   the state of Morelos in which a BMI of 0.13 kg/m^2 higher (95 percent
   CI 0.04, 0.23) was found in adolescent boys who spent

Eating Pattern Trends: Nutritional Transition

   As stated previously, Mexico is experiencing a nutritional transition
   with a clear shift over the past decades to higher intakes of fat,
   refined carbohydrates and processed foods, and lower intakes of whole
   grains, vegetables, and dietary fiber that represent traditional diets
   (Popkin, 2001; Rivera et al., 2004a). The transition is closely related
   to the process of urbanization and the migration from rural areas into
   the cities but also is affecting the rural areas to a lesser extent.
   The relationship among the nutritional transition, urbanization, and
   poverty is complex and manifests differently in various countries.
   Studies have shown that the nutritional transition was observed mainly
   among the higher SES groups living in rural areas and among low SES
   groups in urban areas, suggesting that lower-income populations,
   principally in urbanized environments, could be affected by the two
   extremes of the nutritional spectrum (Seidell, 2000). In Mexico, the
   nutritional transition, as assessed by changes in dietary fat intakes
   and BMI values in adults, has been observed in all regions regardless
   of their level of development, in urban and rural areas, and in all
   socioeconomic groups. In contrast, as presented previously, high BMIs
   in children are more prevalent in the more developed regions and urban
   areas. However, evidence suggests that children living in low-income
   neighborhoods and attending public schools in Tijuana along the Mexican
   side of the U.S.–Mexican border are

   experiencing a nutrition transition with respect to an increased risk
   of obesity and related chronic disease (Villa-Caballero et al., 2005).

   The strongest evidence of this transition comes from the contrast
   between adults’ self-reported dietary intakes from the 1988 and 1999
   National Nutritional Surveys. During this 11-year period, the
   percentage of energy intake from fat among Mexicans increased from 23.5
   percent to 30.3 percent (Figure B-6). This increment was observed
   across all regions of the country, including the poorest region
   (south), which increased from 22.1–26.9 percent during the same time
   period (Rivera et al., 2004a). However, this increment was not observed
   in rural areas, where the percentage of energy intake from fat remained
   stable at 22–23 percent. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information
   about changes in the type of fats (e.g., saturated, trans fat, and
   unsaturated fat) in the Mexican diet, especially for children and
   youth.

   In this same analysis, the mean percentage of energy intake from
   carbohydrates decreased slightly from 59.7 percent to 57.5 percent.
   However, the lack of information on the type of carbohydrate
   (especially in the 1988 survey) limits the possibility to analyze
   intakes of refined versus complex

   carbohydrates. A secondary analysis using data from National Income and
   Expenditure Surveys collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística,
   Geografía e Informática (INEGI) from 1984 to 1998 showed that consumer
   purchases of refined carbohydrates and sweetened sodas increased by 6.3
   percent and 37.2 percent from 1984 to 1998, respectively, whereas the
   amount of fruit and vegetables purchased dropped by almost 30 percent
   during the same period (Figure B-7) (Rivera et al., 2004). This
   observation suggests that complex carbohydrate intake has declined.
   Whether or not the modification of relative prices of these food
   commodities during this period played an influential role in the
   consumer purchases is an area that requires further research.

   In the Second National Nutrition Survey 1999, dietary intake for
   school-aged children was evaluated using a 24-hour dietary recall.
   Foods were ranked according to their contribution to the total amount
   of food intake (in grams). Four food groups represented nearly 50
   percent of their total amount of food consumed. The main contributors
   to children’s diets were milk and dairy products (185.5 g), tortilla
   and maize products (156.4 g), and sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages
   (135.3 g). Only 8 percent of the children had fruits and vegetable
   intakes greater than 400 g/day, which represents the current
   recommended intake (WCRF, 1997), while 56 percent had intakes less than
   100 g/day (Figure B-8) (Ramirez CI and Rivera JA; personal
   communication; February 2006). The median energy intake in preschool
   children was 949 calories and 1,377 in school-aged children. Pro-

   tein intake in both groups was well above adequate levels at 150
   percent of estimated requirements. Children living in the northern and
   Mexico City regions had the highest fat intake and the lowest fiber
   intake. Children living in the southern region, indigenous children,
   and those in the lowest SES group had higher fiber and carbohydrate
   intakes and the lowest fat intake (Barquera et al., 2003).

   A study conducted using data from the Second National Nutrition Survey
   1999 classified foods consumed by children ages 1–4 years as either
   centrally processed or not processed. Centrally processed foods are
   defined as those involving any kind of industrial process, whether they
   are foods that had been consumed without industrial process before
   (e.g., milk or bread) or foods that were developed by industry (e.g.,
   sweetened soda and packaged snack foods). Centrally processed foods
   made an important contribution to the total energy and nutrient intakes
   at the national level and in sub-populations. For example, the
   contribution to total energy intake was 46 percent; protein intake was
   39 percent; total fat intake was 56 percent; and saturated fat intake
   was 69 percent. These findings underscore the im-

   children and demonstrate the need for involving food and beverage
   companies in efforts to prevent and control childhood obesity

Factors that Influence Energy Intake and Energy Expenditure

Family and Sociocultural Factors

   Family and cultural values are strong determinants of both eating
   patterns and physical activity levels (Patrick and Nicklas, 2005).
   Although direct evidence was not available on the role of family and
   cultural values as determinants of childhood obesity in Mexico, there
   is anecdotal evidence suggesting that chubby children are perceived to
   be healthy children, especially among the poorest and rural
   sub-populations, in Mexican society. Researchers are unaware of any
   empirical evidence supporting this widespread cultural belief or its
   origin. It has been suggested that recent and concurrent undernutrition
   in the same communities or even in the same families, reinforce the
   ideas that heavier children are healthier. In a small

   SOURCE: González-Castell et al. (2003).

   study in Xalapa, Veracruz, half of all parents of obese children did
   not identify their own children as having any weight problem (Brewis,
   2003). This parental perception suggests either a level of denial or a
   normalization of obesity that reinforces children to be heavier than
   the accepted healthy range. These beliefs, combined with other cultural
   values such as feeding a child as an act of love and caring, or that
   acquiring and using consumer goods that decrease physical activity such
   as television, video games, and cars are identified as markers of
   higher SES within communities, need to be counterbalanced with
   community-based interventions that empower parents and key community
   members to promote healthier lifestyles. This is an area where both
   observational and experimental research are greatly needed.

   Self-reported energy intake can vary considerably between non-obese and
   obese subjects. Based on data from the Second National Nutrition Survey
   1999, researchers estimated energy under-reporting in Mexican women
   ages 18–49 years using a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire.
   Researchers found that the prevalence of energy under-reporting in
   non-obese women was approximately one-third (33.66 percent) and more
   than half (53.73 percent) in obese women. The adjusted prevalence ratio
   for under-reporting was 1.51 times higher in obese compared with
   non-obese women (95 percent CI 1.35, 1.69). The researchers concluded
   that obese Mexican women tend to under-report energy consumption more
   than their non-obese coun-

   terparts. The differential under-reporting in Mexico between obese and
   non-obese women suggests that there is a perception of the association
   between diet and excess weight, which may be a positive sign of
   increasing awareness of the epidemic (Campirano et al., 2003). However,
   experimental studies in children and adolescents have shown that mean
   daily caloric intakes may be under-reported by as much as 17 to 33
   percent of energy expenditure and that under-reporting tends to
   increase with age (Bandini et al., 2003; Champagne et al., 1998).
   Similar methodological challenges exist for conducting research on
   children’s physical activity levels (IOM, 2005).

   Another factor that may influence dietary patterns and physical
   activity is the change in family structure experienced in Mexico during
   the last two to three decades. The following additional issues also may
   influence dietary and physical activity patterns: the increase of
   women’s roles in the labor force, increasing rates of divorce and
   single parenthood, increasing numbers of families with key members in
   the United States, and decreasing household size. For example, reduced
   time available for food selection and for cooking can encourage the use
   of more energy-dense processed food and therefore can influence the
   quality of the diet. Also, reduced time of parents at home coupled with
   increasing levels of insecurity in the streets may encourage television
   viewing and sedentary lifestyles. However, empirical evidence of these
   possible effects in Mexico is lacking.

Environmental Factors: Transition Toward an Obesogenic Environment

   Opportunities for physical activity. Information about access and use
   of television and the Internet indicates that Mexico is moving toward a
   more sedentary environment. The number of television stations operating
   in the country has increased from 115 in 1980 to 658 in 2004
   (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes, 2005). Not surprisingly,
   by 2000 85 percent of the households in Mexico had access to a
   television set, and this proportion reached 97 percent in Mexico City.
   Even in the states with a high poverty level, such as Chiapas or
   Oaxaca, more than 56 percent of the households had a television set
   (INEGI, 2000). Mexico has a higher number of television sets per capita
   than most Latin American countries, although the number is still lower
   than that in the United States (Figure B-11). However, exposure to
   television in Mexico can be underestimated because Mexican households
   are larger than those in the United States. Restricted television
   (television systems that charge for access) also is becoming more
   popular, increasing from 1,250,000 subscriptions in 1995 to 2,660,000
   in 2003 (COFETEL, 2005).

   In addition to the explosive growth of the television industry in
   Mexico, the Internet also is becoming more popular. The number of
   Internet users grew from 94,000 in 1995 to 16,492,454 in 2005 (INEGI,
   2005a). Most

   FIGURE B-11 Number of television sets per 1,000 inhabitants, selected

   importantly, Internet use is concentrated in youth and adolescents, as
   shown in Figure B-12, rising from 2.43 percent to 7.73 percent between
   2001 and 2005 for children ages 6–11 years and from 14.41 percent to
   34.16 percent between the same years in adolescents ages 12–17 years.
   Finally, it is estimated that more than 22.8 million Mexicans—13.1
   percent of 6- to 11-year-old children and 28.1 percent of 12- to
   17-year-old adolescents—use computers (INEGI, 2005b).

   Another indicator suggesting that the Mexican population is moving
   toward an obesogenic environment with reduced options to engage in
   physical activity is the growth in the number of motorized vehicles.
   Although the population of Mexico has increased 17 percent from 1990 to
   2000, the number of motor vehicles registered increased by 38 percent
   during the same period of time, representing nearly 11 million
   automobiles in 2000 and 13.5 million automobiles in 2002 (INEGI,
   2005b).

   Trends in access to unhealthy and healthy foods. Over the past few
   decades, Mexicans have experienced an increased availability and access
   to less healthful foods and beverages (e.g., high energy–dense, low
   nutrient– dense, and low-fiber foods and high-calorie low-nutrient
   beverages). This is especially true for Mexicans living in urban areas.
   This increased access to these types of foods and beverages is yet
   another fact indicating the country is shifting toward an obesogenic
   environment.

   Transnational corporations representing the fast food restaurant or
   quick serve restaurant industry have expanded substantially over all
   the major and middle-size cities across Mexico. The first Mexican
   franchise of McDonald’s Corporation opened in 1985 in one of the
   wealthiest neighborhoods of Mexico City. According to the company’s
   website, there are currently 320 franchises nationwide located not only
   in wealthy areas but also in middle- and low-income neighborhoods
   (McDonald’s Corporation, 2006). A very similar phenomenon has happened
   with other restaurant companies such ALSEA, which operates Domino’s
   Pizza and Burger King in Mexico. According to a company report (ALSEA,
   2005), over 15 years, the quick serve restaurant company has
   established 529 Domino’s Pizza sites in 123 cities and promoted sales
   of more than 37 million pizzas in 2004. Indeed, hamburgers and pizza
   are the major types of fast food restaurants representing 30 percent
   and 37 percent, respectively, of the entire fast food market in Mexico.
   The success of these companies relies on the acceptance of their
   products by Mexicans. Given the huge consumer demand, the meals are
   affordable for a large proportion of the population (Hawkes, 2002).

   Another form of energy-dense foods that are widely available is Mexican
   street foods that are sold informally on the streets in cities as well
   as in schools. Although data are limited about the numbers of sites,
   varieties, prices, and nutrient-content of the Mexican street foods,
   this industry appears to be rooted in Mexican culinary culture and its
   growth has paralleled the population growth in urban areas. An
   important feature of this industry

   is the modification of traditional Mexican food that usually was not
   fried and contained tomato, hot pepper, and other vegetables. However,
   current street foods sold are high energy–dense as a result of
   widespread use of vegetable oil for frying, increasing the use of cream
   and cheese, and reducing the use of vegetables. Therefore, this
   “Mexican fast food,” which is not centrally processed, is an important
   source of total energy in the Mexican diet, including children and
   youth.

   As with the fast food restaurant industry, the high consumption of
   sweetened beverages, particularly carbonated soft drinks, in Mexico is
   linked to large-scale marketing activities across multiple media
   platforms (e.g., print, radio, broadcast and cable television,
   Internet, outdoor signage). Indeed, according to a WHO report that
   reviewed marketing activities of global soft drink and fast food
   companies in emerging markets, Mexico was identified as the world’s
   leading per-capita consumer of Coca-Cola. In 1998, Mexicans consumed
   more than 400 milliliters per day of sweetened carbonated soft drinks.
   By volume of sales, Mexico is the Coca-Cola Company’s second largest
   market after the United States (Hawkes et al., 2002).

   Another important source of energy in the Mexican diet is the high
   intake of oil. The use of oils with a high trans fatty acid content has
   increased considerably in both the fast food industry and in baked and
   fried foods and snacks produced by industry. Also, high fructose corn
   syrup has been replacing the sugar cane as a sweetener in soft drink
   production, although some evidence exists about its potential impact on
   weight gain (Bray et al., 2004), this is still a topic of much debate.
   The association of certain types of fats or sweeteners to obesity
   remains unknown and needs further research.

   Advertising and marketing trends. In 2004, food advertising was ranked
   fourth and beverage advertising was ranked sixth in 20 categories for
   the amount spent on advertising to Mexicans through television, radio,
   and print media totaling US $1.064 billion and US $565 million,
   respectively. Television advertising is the primary venue for food and
   beverage advertising to the Mexican population (WARC, 2005). There were
   limited data publicly available to the authors documenting the growing
   trend of companies’ promotion of high energy–dense and low
   nutrient–dense foods and sweetened beverages, sedentary activities, and
   entertainment to Mexican children and youth. There are data showing
   that fast food restaurant and beverage companies engage in
   philanthropic activities and sponsorship of sporting events as ways to
   market to Mexican youth (Hawkes, 2002). The Global Kids Study,
   conducted in 1996 and 1998 by Just Kid Inc., Nickelodeon, and Research
   International, provides information about the brand and consumer
   environment, attitudes, beliefs, and consumption behaviors

   of a cohort of 400 children, ages 7–12 years, and their mothers who
   were surveyed in each of six countries. The purpose of the marketing
   research was to provide Nickelodeon with a strategic planning tool to
   support the entertainment company’s international business initiatives
   targeting children and youth in countries such as Mexico. The cities
   where the study was conducted in Mexico include Mexico City,
   Guadalajara, and Monterey. An interview and questionnaire were used to
   gather detailed marketing research data about the children and their
   families. The findings showed that international global brands, such as
   Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken, are well
   recognized by Mexican children based on their brand awareness and
   preferences (Friend and Stapylton-Smith, 1999). There are presently no
   publicly available data documenting Mexican children’s and youths’
   discretionary income, particularly among higher SES groups, which they
   may use to purchase foods and beverages without parental guidance,
   especially away from home settings such as fast food restaurants,
   shopping malls, and schools.

   Consumers ages 18 years and younger are subject to special protection
   under Mexican law. However, there is currently no single governmental
   authority or body of law governing products or advertising to Mexican
   children and youth. The three government institutions primarily
   responsible for the regulation of children’s advertising in Mexico are
   the Attorney General for Consumer Protection, Ministry of the Interior,
   and the Ministry of Health (Arochi et al., 2004). The non-governmental
   self-regulatory organization in Mexico is the National Council for
   Advertising (Consejo Nacional de la Publicidad) (Friedman and Dickler,
   2003). There are clear guidelines and laws restricting the promotion of
   alcohol and tobacco products to Mexican children. According to Article
   16 of the Communications Council Code of Ethics, advertisers must not
   “undermine parental authority, judgment, or preferences” and “children
   should not be encouraged to urge other persons to purchase a product,
   especially their parents.” Companies are also encouraged to avoid
   taking advantage of children’s credulity or lack of experience. While
   television and radio advertising should not exceed 18 percent of the
   total time of transmission to Mexicans, special regulations for
   children’s advertising have not yet been developed in Mexico.
   Furthermore, there are currently no guidelines or regulations for the
   promotion of high-calorie and low-nutrient foods and beverages to young
   consumers (Arochi et al., 2004).

   However, Mexico is one of the many countries that endorsed the WHO
   Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health at the 57th
   World Health Assembly in 2004 (WHO, 2004). The Global Strategy provides
   member states with a range of policy options to address less healthful
   dietary practices and physical inactivity, including provisions for
   marketing, advertising, sponsorship, and promotion to support
   international public

   health goals. These provisions recommended that “food and beverage
   advertisements should not exploit children’s inexperience or
   credulity,” should discourage messages that promote less healthful
   dietary practices, and encourage positive healthful messages (WHO,
   2004).

   School environments. Unhealthy weight in children, particularly in
   school-age children, results from an environment that enhances the
   intake of high energy–dense foods and restricts the opportunities for
   regular physical activity. Children spend a substantial amount of time
   at school. Therefore, the school environment is an important influence
   on their physical activity behaviors and dietary patterns.

   The Ministry of Education implements a physical education program in
   elementary schools nationwide (Secretaría de Educación Pública, 1994)
   that envisions two physical education sessions, each lasting about
   30–50 minutes per week, as a means to promote a healthy lifestyle. The
   program also aims to promote a healthy diet through elementary-level
   educational materials that include units related to hygiene and
   nutrition and the promotion of healthful lifestyles.

   The physical education component of the program is structured according
   to the different skills and development characteristics attributable to
   each age group. The program is designed to promote five different types
   of skills. Stimulation of motor perception; conditional physical
   skills; basic sports skills building; physical education for health;
   and social interaction. The plan includes a section that suggests
   several activities and one more that recommends methods for evaluating
   the plan’s performance. Nevertheless, the program is not implemented as
   designed according to existing policies.

   Researchers conducted a search for publications on the school
   environment and its relationship to childhood obesity in Mexican
   schools but was not able to find published articles on this topic.
   However, formative research was obtained from a project that was
   recently initiated in 12 public schools in Mexico City; the project
   aims to change the core elements in the school environment that promote
   obesity (Rivera J, National Institute of Public Health; personal
   communication; March 2006). The first phase of the project undertook an
   assessment of the school environment. Preliminary data from children in
   4th and 5th grades in 12 schools representing over 1700 students showed
   that children, are exposed to an unhealthy environment in several ways.
   Children are exposed to high energy–dense foods (e.g., high-fat and
   high-sugar snacks and foods such as candy, ice cream, pizza, pork skin
   chips with cream, tacos, and other traditional Mexican fried foods) and
   to large portion sizes. In addition, children eat several times at
   school (they have as much as six feeding opportunities during the four
   hours at school). The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables is
   very lim-

   ited, and most often the available fruits are served with cream. The
   preparation and handling of foods sold in schools are under uncertain
   sanitary conditions that increases the food safety risks for the
   children. Additionally, most of the schools lack free drinking water
   from fountains. In the few schools where potable water fountains are
   available, they are not well maintained and are not used for drinking
   water.

   Physical activity is low. The school-break period is the time designed
   to eat lunch, and there is limited time left for active play or
   physical activity. During this time children are not allowed to run due
   to safety concerns, because all grades have recess at the same time and
   older children running or playing could harm younger children. In
   addition, there is limited space available for physical activity in
   many of the schools surveyed. In general, the school facilities and
   sports equipment do not facilitate adequate physical education classes
   and children spend on average less than 40 minutes of Physical
   Education (PE) per week, about 40 percent of the time established by
   norms (100 minutes per week). Moreover, PE classes are not active
   enough; children spend only nine minutes per week on moderate to
   vigorous physical activity.

   These results are similar to findings from a small pilot study in 10
   schools in Mexico City. In this sample, approximately half of the
   schools in the pilot study did not have appropriate areas for the
   physical education classes; the average space available was 290 m^2 for
   approximately 330 students. Moreover, teachers showed little motivation
   to promote physical activity, and the physical education classes were
   not well structured. Approximately 30 percent of children did not
   participate in physical education classes, and moderate to vigorous
   physical activity was achieved for approximately 10 minutes by those
   participating in the physical education classes. In 80 percent of the
   schools the average length of the physical education class is 50
   minutes a day, and the remaining 20 percent of the schools divide the
   class length by age groups (30 minutes for children younger than 10
   years of age and 50 minutes for older children) two times per week.
   Only 20 percent of the schools organize and promote extracurricular
   sporting events such as soccer and athletics tournaments. One of the
   major limitations of extracurricular physical activity programs is that
   many schools have several shifts (e.g., morning and evening) at the
   same facility, so that extracurricular physical activity programs are
   not possible. The following issues were identified as potentially
   important in terms of their influence on behavior and dietary intake at
   school:
     * Lack of drinking water from water fountains or other public
       supplies at schools in seven of the eight schools surveyed, which
       may promote the intake of sweetened beverages.

     * Lack of bottled water and the widespread availability of sweetened
       beverages in concession stands that have similar prices; therefore,
       there may be a reduced incentive for the children to drink water
       during the school day.
     * Lack of regulations for foods and beverages sold either at
       concession stands on the school grounds or at retail establishments
       located near schools.
     * The federally funded and mandatory school breakfast program
       provides energy-dense and centrally processed foods at very
       affordable prices.
     * Widespread availability of high energy–dense foods and sweetened
       beverages within and around the school environment.
     * Low availability of vegetables and fruits within and around the
       school environment.

   Although this formative research is not representative of public
   schools throughout Mexico, or even the schools in Mexico City, it
   provides a qualitative assessment of the school environment that may be
   useful to identify the elements within the environment that promote
   obesity and opportunities for positively intervening to promote a
   healthier school environment.

   Other environmental factors. These factors are important determinants
   of an environment favoring a positive energy balance in most of the
   Mexican population. However, there are many other factors that are
   likely to influence children and youth and can be considered components
   of an obesogenic environment. However, there is limited research on
   these factors upon which to design evidence-based strategies for
   effectively preventing obesity in Mexican children and youth.

   The exponential growth of mega cities in Mexico, with a lack of
   environmental design planning to facilitate physical activity, are
   likely to have an important impact on the availability and access to
   physical activity facilities, especially in poor and new neighborhoods
   in the suburbs of these cities. Data regarding availability and use of
   physical activity facilities are clearly needed to evaluate and
   potentially modify this factor. Another issue potentially contributing
   to reduced physical activity are safety concerns and poor air quality
   in Mexican cities, especially in Mexico City, which has been identified
   as one of the cities worldwide with the highest level of air pollution
   (Villarreal-Calderón et al., 2002).

   Finally, with regard to energy intake, it is likely that a change in
   agricultural and food production policies favoring large-scale
   production, marketing supports for commercial producers, and developing
   a more competitive agricultural sector for export markets (Zahniser et
   al., 2005) could modify the price and access of certain foods but not
   necessarily the most healthful choices. Many of these policies adhere
   to international trade agreements such as North American Free Trade
   Agreement (NAFTA) (Zahniser et al., 2005); thus the impact and
   consequences they may have on the di-

   etary patterns of the Mexican population has not been fully explored.
   Further research in this area is needed.

CURRENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

   Despite the strong evidence of an increasing obesity epidemic among
   children and adolescents in Mexico, its impact on the awareness of the
   population at different levels has been limited. Within the last few
   years, perhaps as a consequence of published research and dissemination
   of the Second National Nutritional Survey 1999 results, the obesity
   epidemic has reached the media, especially print- and web-based media.
   Among the scientific community, obesity, particularly in children, is
   currently a topic that has generated a great deal of attention in terms
   of funding and human resources, with support for several ongoing
   research projects. However, there is still an enormous need for raising
   awareness at the individual, family, and community levels, as well as
   within the government sector at all levels. Probably because of the
   recent and still current problem of undernutrition as one of the main
   public health problems among children, the complete understanding of
   the double burden of undernutrition and obesity from the government and
   policymakers is needed to elevate childhood obesity as a national
   priority.

   As a consequence of the low awareness within the government sector,
   there are a limited number of programs, mostly on a small scale, and
   information about these programs is not readily available. The next
   section describes selected programs and policies that are related to
   the obesity problem.

Government Policies on Food Labeling, Media Control, and Dietary Guidelines

   Mexico has a set of policies, norms, and guidelines for food labeling
   and media control of advertising food products. However, there are many
   inconsistencies during the implementation of these policies, and many
   of them have not been periodically reviewed or modified in response to
   the increasing public health problem of obesity. There has not been any
   evaluation on consumer understanding and the impact of the information
   provided on food labels. Regarding the media control, as noted earlier,
   television advertising is the primary venue for food and beverage
   advertising to the Mexican population (WARC, 2005). However, there is a
   lack of data on the effects of advertising on Mexican children’s
   preferences, purchase requests, and influence on household purchases of
   food and beverage products. Limited evidence indicates that there may
   be a rise in television advertising of processed foods and beverages
   high in sugar or fat, or both, and

   with healthy nutrition claims without specific policies guiding the
   health claims or types of advertising reaching young children.

   For several years a group of nutrition experts has been working on
   developing dietary guidelines for Mexico. After a long process that led
   to consensus-based guidelines, they are soon to be officially published
   for the Mexican population. The guidelines are based on a plate model
   rather than a food guide pyramid (Figure B-13) and present food groups
   and advice on ways that consumers can combine them. Since these are
   consensus-based guidelines, this educational tool can be used as the
   basis for developing an effective communication strategy aimed at
   improving dietary practices in Mexico.

Social Programs

Oportunidades

   The pillar of the Mexican social assistance strategy is the conditional
   cash transfer program, Oportunidades. The objective of the program is
   to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty though the development
   of human capital. At present, the program reaches more than five
   million families (about 25 million people) living in extreme poverty.

   Oportunidades provides families with a monetary transfer intended for
   food purchase, a fortified food supplement for all children from 6 to
   23

   months of age, children aged 2 to 4 years with low weight for age, and
   for pregnant and lactating women; and educational scholarships
   conditioned on regular attendance in school, the size of which is grade
   and gender dependent. All benefits are conditioned on the use of
   regular preventative health services, the content of which changes over
   the life-course and regular attendance of the female head of household
   (to whom the monetary transfer is also given) to a series of health and
   nutrition education workshops. The program also provides curative
   health care (SEDESOL, 2006).

   A number of positive impacts of the Oportunidades program on
   nutritional status of the population have been reported. In both urban
   (Neufeld et al., 2006) and rural Mexico (Rivera et al., 2004b)
   participation is the program resulted in an increase of approximately 1
   cm in linear growth of children who were in the program from a very
   young age (< 6 mo) compared to children of similar age not in the
   program. A positive impact on the prevalence of anemia has also been
   reported among children less than 2 years of age (Rivera et al., 2004;
   Neufeld et al., 2005). However, there is concern that participation in
   the program may promote undesirable excess weight gain. Increased
   weight gain with improved socioeconomic status and higher income has
   been documented in a number of settings around the world (Uauy et al.,
   2001; Du et al., 2004). The extra resources provided to the family may
   be used to purchase more high energy–dense foods and sweetened
   beverages. The fortified food supplement for women and children provide
   approximately 1.4 and 2.15 kcal/g, respectively. In this population
   where the diet does not appear to have an energy deficit, regular
   consumption of the supplement in addition to the usual home diet
   without substitution of a similar quantity of energy may result in
   excess weight gain. Regular consumption is clearly desirable due to its
   high micronutrient content, approximately 100 percent of the
   Recommended Dietary Intake (IOM, 2001) of iron, zinc, and a number of
   other micronutrients known to be deficient in the diets of Mexican
   children and women during pregnancy and lactation (Rivera et al., 2003)
   . Consumption of the supplement has been shown to result in
   considerable improvements in the dietary intake of micronutrients and
   there is some indication of improvements in mineral status of women and
   children (Neufeld et al., 2006). On the other hand, the health and
   nutrition workshops and increased exposure to preventative health care
   services may lead to improved dietary and lifestyle choices among
   beneficiaries with a resultant decrease in the prevalence and/or
   severity of obesity.

   The prevalence of obesity in adults who were eventually enrolled in the
   program (before program benefits were received) was over 20 percent
   (Fernald et al., 2004). In women living in urban Mexico, program
   participation was associated with a greater increase in body mass index
   over a two-year follow-up period compared to non-participants,
   particularly among those who had high body mass index at the start of
   the follow-up

   (Neufeld et al., 2006). There was an increase of 1.5 percent in the
   prevalence of obesity in adolescents involved in the program when
   compared to adolescents who did not participate (Gutiérrez et al.,
   2005). Among preschool children, there is no evidence that
   participation in the program is associated with obesity, although there
   was a tendency towards higher BMI among the children who were enrolled
   in the program before 6 months of age, compared to non-beneficiaries
   (Neufeld et al., 2006).

   The Oportunidades program with its system of co-responsibilities and
   its broad coverage is a promising vehicle through which to launch
   obesity prevention. Two studies are currently underway as part of the
   program evaluation activities to further clarify the impact of the
   program on weight gain among women and children and to strengthen the
   health education component of the program in reference to obesity
   prevention. The first is a large randomized controlled trial
   implemented within the context of the program. The main objective of
   the study is to determine whether regular consumption of the fortified
   food supplement is associated with increased weight gain among children
   and women during pregnancy and increased weight retention post partum
   compared to two other supplements with identical micronutrient content
   but without additional energy. The second study uses qualitative
   research methods to gain an understanding of the perceived determinants
   of overweight and obesity in the population and barriers to change in
   behaviors associated with excess weight gain. The results of both
   studies will be presented to decision makers within the program with
   specific recommendations of how to strengthen obesity prevention among
   program beneficiaries.

Health-Sector Programs

Preven-IMSS

   The National Institute for Social Security (IMSS) provides health
   services to approximately 50 percent of the Mexican population. As part
   of the organization’s process of health improvement services, they
   recently designed and implemented an integrated health programs
   strategy known as Preven-IMSS. This strategy is focused on a portfolio
   of preventive actions aimed at improving the health status of their
   target population and marks the first time that IMSS has launched a
   large-scale prevention program. Starting in 2002, actions were
   organized by age group and vulnerable populations: children (younger
   than 10 years of age), adolescents (ages 10– 19 years), women (ages
   20–59 years), men (ages 20–59 years), and older adults (older than 60
   years of age). All the programs include major food and nutrition,
   physical activity, and health education components (Gutiérrez-Trujillo,
   2005).

   The main preventive actions for children are focused on health
   promotion, nutrition education, disease control and prevention, early
   identification of diseases, oral health, vaccination, and miscellaneous
   actions (e.g., personal hygiene, breastfeeding promotion, and fever
   control). For adolescents, the program’s preventive actions are focused
   on physical activity promotion; accident prevention; violence and
   addiction prevention; oral health; sexual health and education;
   nutrition education; obesity detection and control; parasite treatment;
   vaccination; use of preservatives; human immunodeficiency virus and
   sexually transmitted diseases prevention; visual, auditory, and
   postural defects; and reproductive health. There are also components
   for adults.

   For each preventive action, there is a set of designed activities and
   objectives personalized for each age group. As part of the promotion
   strategy, this program has a nationally distributed magazine (sold at
   newspaper shops) that features health care information related to these
   actions. In addition, television advertisements focus on healthy
   lifestyles, nutrition, obesity prevention, and promoting the magazine
   to the general public. Until now, this program has not been evaluated
   fully; however, a recent internal baseline survey was designed and
   implemented to assess the coverage of the main components and to
   evaluate intermediate program outcomes such as prevalence of anemia,
   frequency of physical activity, undernutrition, overweight, and
   obesity. This survey found an inadequate register of the nutritional
   status in the diverse population groups and of the health promotion
   activities. It is expected that one-year follow-up surveys will monitor
   selected outcomes of this integrated health program
   (Gutiérrez-Trujillo, 2005).

Ministry of Health Programs for Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases

   The Ministry of Health of Mexico has several programs that consider
   prevention as a relevant component (Ministry of Health, 2006). These
   programs are not integrated health or nutrition programs but programs
   focused primarily on the most relevant public health problems, such as
   obesity, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and cancer. Each of
   these diseases has a program that includes general management and
   preventive recommendations that must be followed by the government
   health service providers. However, most (if not all) of these programs,
   focus attention on promoting behavioral changes and early detection in
   adults, especially young adults over the age of 20 years. Obesity
   prevention during childhood and adolescence has been given much less
   consideration; rather, the predominant problems of concern for this
   group are related to food security (undernutrition and micronutrients
   deficiencies).

   The following are some recently implemented actions for increasing the
   awareness and actions related to obesity prevention in children and
   youth in the public sector:
    1. Implementation of regional or state-level programs; evaluation by
       the state (public) health sector needs to be conducted.
    2. Creation of obesity clinics in public pediatric hospitals
       addressing the clinical care and management of obese children and
       research focuses on the consequences of obesity.
    3. Development of an official memo outlining a future nationwide
       communication campaign for obesity prevention that in addition to
       addressing food production, media regulation, and food labeling, is
       intended to promote healthier lifestyles with special attention to
       children and adolescents.
    4. Addition of obesity prevention among children and adolescents as
       one of the five priorities for research funding in the last request
       for proposals by CONACYT, the federal agency that provides
       oversight for research funding.

   Moreover, recent efforts by the private sector have been implemented
   but must still be evaluated.

GOALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   In accordance with the recommendations in the IOM report, Preventing
   Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance (IOM, 2005), the final goals
   for obesity prevention among childhood and youth should be to stop the
   current trend in rising obesity incidence and prevalence and related
   chronic diseases and ultimately reduce the proportion of children and
   youth with an unhealthy weight. This ultimate goal necessarily should
   include increasing the proportion of children and adolescents meeting a
   healthful diet and appropriate amounts of regular physical activity and
   following a healthy growth trajectory. In the process of achieving
   these goals, it is important to define intermediate outcomes that will
   be needed to evaluate progress of a multi-faceted obesity prevention
   strategy. Based on the information described in previous sections, the
   authors propose a series of goals and recommendations for action for a
   multilevel and nationwide obesity prevention strategy among children
   and adolescents. An objective of the U.S.–Mexico binational meeting
   will be to broadly discuss this list of recommendations among key
   persons from each sector (e.g., academia, government, industry,
   schools, communities) to reach consensus on the next steps needed to
   initiate this multilevel strategy. A list of possible intermediate
   outcomes and goals for discussion during the binational meeting
   include:

     * Increased quantity and quality of physical activity at schools in
       both planned physical education time and recreational time such as
       recess.
     * Increased and improved facilities for recreational activities in
       communities, especially suburban areas.
     * Increased advertising and marketing messages in preferably
       broadcast, cable, and satellite television, but also in other media
       such as radio, the Internet, and cell phones, aimed at children,
       youth, and their parents that promote healthy lifestyles, including
       healthful diets and regular physical activity.
     * Decreased number of media advertising or marketing campaigns
       promoting high-calorie and low-nutrient food and beverage products
       targeted at children and adolescents that increase the risk of
       positive energy balance (such as refined sugars and saturated and
       trans fats).
     * Decreased proportion of children and youth who have more than two
       hours of leisure screen time (including television and video
       watching) per day.
     * Increased proportion of children and youth consuming more than five
       portions of fruits and vegetables per day.

   As stated in the IOM recommendations, in order to achieve these types
   of intermediate outcomes, a multilevel strategy clearly is needed.
   However, in contrast to the U.S. context, Mexican society at large
   (e.g., government, industry, community leaders, schools, families) is
   far behind on some fundamental aspects needed to build support for this
   strategy. Three main issues that should be covered as priority steps in
   developing an effective obesity prevention strategy are:
     * creating awareness among decision makers (including all branches of
       federal and state powers) as well as among the general public;
     * regulating and enforcing laws;
     * empowering communities so that they can achieve the necessary
       changes in different environments (e.g., school, community,
       industry) that, as described in previous sections, are contributing
       to a net positive energy balance among Mexicans in general, and
       specifically children and youth.

   Priority recommendations for action specifically related to the Mexican
   context are listed below. The recommendations can be viewed as
   preliminary and will be modified through discussion with different
   stakeholders.

Government Level

     * Underpin the idea of childhood obesity prevention as an urgent
       national priority, with strong participation and leadership of
       government at all levels in several actions including:

     * Regulations and implementation of media and food, beverage, and
       restaurant industry policies;
     * Support and funding of obesity prevention programs at federal and
       state levels with planned evaluations of their health impact;
     * Support and funding of surveillance and monitoring efforts and wide
       dissemination of their findings not only at the national level,
       such as the National Nutrition Surveys, but also at the state and
       county levels;
     * Planning of urban development with an appropriate access and
       promotion of facilities for recreational activities;
     * Initiation of a widespread nationwide media campaign across print,
       electronic (e.g., radio, television), and wireless and
       Internet-based media (e.g., cell phones) to increase awareness of
       the obesity problem in the population;
     * Expand the training of professionals to design, implement, and
       evaluate strategies for effectively responding to the obesity
       epidemic.

     * Review current regulations for food labeling (NOM 051-SECOFI and
       NOM-086-SSA1-1994), evaluate the impact and consumers’
       understanding of food labeling, and make necessary modifications
       required to support obesity prevention goals.
     * Review current government regulations and guidelines on the use of
       health claims on food products, especially nutrition-related health
       claims.
     * Develop incentives or regulations for advertising and marketing to
       children and youth, especially for food and beverage products high
       in total calories and in particular for those with a high content
       of refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and fat.
     * Seek mechanisms such as incentives or regulations to improve the
       enforcement of policies related to media and the food, beverage,
       and restaurant industries, including food labeling.
     * Create an advisory committee that, together with the Federal
       Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS), will
       develop and evaluate policies for food labeling, marketing, media
       control, and dietary guidelines. This committee should include
       experts from different public and private institutions, as well as
       industry representatives and consumers. Priority steps should focus
       on the following areas:
          + Modify food labeling, focusing on the need of acceptance and
            understanding for the majority of the population. Limited
            evidence suggests that most of the information contained on
            food labels is difficult for consumers to understand. Develop
            communication strategies that are clear and understandable by
            the general public.
          + Reduce, at minimum, the content of health claims in
            media-based marketing, especially for those foods that promote
            “healthy” choices that do not meet basic nutritional
            guidelines.

          + Conduct research on advertising and marketing targeted at
            Mexican children and youth focused on high-calorie,
            low-nutrient food and beverage products, and limit or
            eliminate practices that promote these types of products.
          + In collaboration with industry, conduct research on the types
            and amount of fat that is used and needed in products.
          + Set a limit on the recommended use of dietary fats and oils,
            particularly saturated fat and trans fats, by the food,
            beverage, and restaurant industry and fast food available
            through informal establishments.
          + Regulate media marketing for food products with high content
            of refined carbohydrates and fat in regards to type of
            information, and advertising locations. For example, the
            possibility of setting strict limits in children’s
            environments, such as schools, parks, and entertainment
            centers, should be researched and discussed.

     * Evaluate the use of policy instruments such as international trade,
       subsidies, and taxes for encouraging or discouraging the production
       and consumption of certain foods to encourage the availability and
       access to healthful foods such as fruits and vegetables during all
       seasons and to reduce the consumption of less healthful foods and
       beverages.
     * Promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables and other familiar
       healthful foods and beverages through diverse media.
     * Promote a diverse media campaign supporting the consumption of
       water as a substitute for sweetened beverages (including carbonated
       soft drinks).

School Level

     * Revise the school breakfast program to ensure healthful food and
       meal options.
     * Regulate the foods and beverages offered to children and youth in
       and around the school environment.
     * Promote the enforcement of minimally established time that children
       and youth participate in physical education in both private and
       public schools, as well as physical education programs that achieve
       the recommended amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activity.
     * Encourage the organization of local and regional events to promote
       sports practice in schools.
     * Define minimal spaces at schools to ensure regular physical
       activity during physical education time and during recess.
     * Revise and improve school curricula to include obesity prevention
       and healthy lifestyle promotion.

Community Level

     * Stimulate community organization and community members’ empowerment
       to request and influence the modification of norms and environments
       aimed at achieving healthy lifestyles.
     * Explore the spectrum of available organizations to identify the
       best strategies for increasing community empowerment and awareness,
       especially among parents, of the obesity epidemic. Potential
       community organizations include parents’ societies, religious
       groups, and non-governmental organizations.

   In conclusion, Mexico is on the course of an epidemiologic and
   nutritional transition toward more sedentary lifestyles and obesogenic
   environments. The present trajectory is moving toward an increasing
   burden of obesity in children and youth with serious predictable health
   and economic burdens to the entire population and Mexican society.
   These risks must be addressed immediately with multi-level
   interventions undertaken by a variety of stakeholders in government,
   schools, and communities targeting children and youth in many settings.
   The response to the growing obesity epidemic in Mexico will require
   many years and perhaps decades to implement and to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the results. The joint U.S.–Mexico workshop, for which
   this and the companion paper from the U.S. context served as background
   for discussion, should delineate the initial steps of the strategy
   required to tackle this urgent public health problem.

   The Joint U.S.-Mexico Workshop on Preventing Obesity in Children and
   Youth of Mexican Origin was initiated by a desire to share experiences
   regarding the problem of obesity in children and youth of Mexican
   origin on both sides of the border, with a particular focus on
   potential solutions. U.S and Mexican researchers, public health
   officials, industry leaders, and policy-makers engaged in valuable
   dialogue to share perspectives, challenges, and opportunities.
   Commonalities and differences in the United States and Mexico regarding
   risk factors, potential interventions and programs, and need for all
   sectors to collaborate and make progress toward solving this serious
   public health problem were also discussed. This dialogue served as a
   basis to explore a bi-national agenda for addressing this epidemic,
   which was the ultimate goal of the workshop.

Downloading and Using eBooks from NAP

What is an eBook?

   An ebook is one of two file formats that are intended to be used with
   e-reader devices and apps such as Amazon Kindle or Apple iBooks.

Why is an eBook better than a PDF?

   A PDF is a digital representation of the print book, so while it can be
   loaded into most e-reader programs, it doesn't allow for resizable text
   or advanced, interactive functionality. The eBook is optimized for
   e-reader devices and apps, which means that it offers a much better
   digital reading experience than a PDF, including resizable text and
   interactive features (when available).

Where do I get eBook files?

   eBook files are now available for a large number of reports on the
   NAP.edu website. If an eBook is available, you'll see the option to

   Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts

Description

   The growing problem of changing environmental conditions caused by
   climate destabilization is well recognized as one of the defining
   issues of our time. The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions, and
   the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate
   geoengineering has often been considered to be a "last-ditch" response
   to climate change, to be used only if climate change damage should
   produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing
   to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on
   emissions control, there is a lack of information on these ways of
   potentially intervening in the climate system.

   As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention
   discusses albedo modification - changing the fraction of incoming solar
   radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately
   modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to
   compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with
   greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo
   modification raises political and governance issues at national and
   global levels, as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention:
   Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social,
   political, and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques.

   It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it
   should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action. One
   serious concern is that such an action could be unilaterally undertaken
   by a small nation or smaller entity for its own benefit without
   international sanction and regardless of international consequences.
   Transparency in discussing this subject is critical. In the spirit of
   that transparency, Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool
   Earth was based on peer-reviewed literature and the judgments of the
   authoring committee; no new research was done as part of this study and
   all data and information used are from entirely open sources. By
   helping to bring light to this topic area, this book will help leaders
   to be far more knowledgeable about the consequences of albedo
   modification approaches before they face a decision whether or not to
   use them.

Description

   To achieve goals for climate and economic growth, “negative emissions
   technologies” (NETs) that remove and sequester carbon dioxide from the
   air will need to play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
   Unlike carbon capture and storage technologies that remove carbon
   dioxide emissions directly from large point sources such as coal power
   plants, NETs remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or
   enhance natural carbon sinks. Storing the carbon dioxide from NETs has
   the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously
   preventing an equal amount of carbon dioxide from being emitted. Recent
   analyses found that deploying NETs may be less expensive and less
   disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion
   of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation
   emissions.

   In 2015, the National Academies published Climate Intervention: Carbon
   Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration, which described and
   initially assessed NETs and sequestration technologies. This report
   acknowledged the relative paucity of research on NETs and recommended
   development of a research agenda that covers all aspects of NETs from
   fundamental science to full-scale deployment. To address this need,
   Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research
   Agenda assesses the benefits, risks, and “sustainable scale potential”
   for NETs and sequestration. This report also defines the essential
   components of a research and development program, including its
   estimated costs and potential impact.
