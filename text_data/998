The 8 Stages of a TV Couple, From ‘Will-They-Won’t-They’ to ‘OMG, They Did’

   By Kathryn VanArendonk

   For the next three weeks, Vulture is holding a TV Couple Scuffle to
   determine the greatest couple on television in the past 30 years.
   (Today, Heather Havrilesky will decide whether Friday Night Lights’
   Tami and Eric Taylor or The Sopranos’ Tony and Carmela will move on to
   the next round.) Below, Kathryn VanArendonk breaks down the many
   relationship stages a TV couple cycles through.

   Like the prehistoric apes and fans of the first season of Heroes,
   couple-dom on TV often follows a regular, inevitable evolution. We
   often love romantic relationships on TV at some specific, distinct
   stages, but if a show is on long enough (or if it burns through plot
   quickly), most TV couples will live through several iterations of
   narrative pairing, oscillating between driving the main story and
   taking a backseat to other plots.

   Not all couples will follow this trajectory, and some of the best and
   most interesting are those who break the rules. There are also many who
   begin at a later stage. But for most shows, this is what the default
   life path of a romantic pairing looks like, a timeline suitable for
   examination, so you can prep yourself for when Cece and Schmidt
   inexorably move into post-marriage conflict phase.

   The Together Phase

   The will-they-won’t-they.
   This is one of the most familiar, and most treacherous, stages in a TV
   couple’s life. It’s a device that crosses genres and decades, defining
   sitcoms and dramas, vampire shows and workplace comedies, and police
   procedurals and family melodramas alike. Moonlighting is perhaps the
   best-known example of a show where the couple (and the show) could not
   survive the transition past romantic consummation, but it’s often
   considered a turning point even in shows that go on for several more
   years. Remember when Castle was kind of fun? Yeah. In some of the best
   TV relationships, though, this is just the first, headiest stage of the
   relationship, full of sexy glances and meaningful stares and live
   studio audiences making the wooooOOOOooo sound.

   The OMG, they did.
   Many TV couples never make it past the will-they-won’t-they. The West
   Wing ends at the precise moment Donna and Josh get together. If they do
   survive, though, there’s a brief, confusing, sometimes giddy, and often
   fraught stage where everyone tries to adjust to the new paradigm. On
   Friends, it’s Phoebe and Joey playing a high-stakes game of chicken
   about who knows that Chandler and Monica are together. On Gilmore
   Girls, it’s Rory and Lorelai going on a double date so awful that they
   have to break out the Bop-It.

   They’re together now, time to find some other story lines.
   This is the moment when you really hope that your favorite TV couple is
   on a show that also has plenty of other stuff going on. Just as in real
   life, TV relationships often need some space to breathe, and it’s a
   good opportunity for a show to shift to some other plots while the
   happy couple spends some time being happy together. (Happiness is great
   in real life; happiness is usually pretty boring in fiction.) Corey and
   Topanga got together on Boy Meets World — time to tell some Shawn
   stories! If the couple is really the main juice going on in a show,
   though, hold on to your horses, because it’ll be time to move straight
   into …

   The Breakup Phase

   They’re together now, time to make them unhappy.
   After the will-they-won’t-they, this may be the most familiar (and most
   frustrating) stage in any TV couple relationship. When your series
   hinges on the dramatic tension of one specific character, continued
   conflict is inevitable. You may recognize this stage as Ross and
   Rachel’s “We were on a break!”; basically all of Hannah and Adam’s
   relationship on Girls; Pam’s stint at art school and, later, the
   Michael Scott Paper Company on The Office; and the arrival of Addison
   on Grey’s Anatomy. Speaking of which …

   The love triangle.
   Technically, this stage can (and frequently does) happen in the
   will-they-won’t-they phase, but it’s often at its most potent after two
   characters have finally gotten together and are now threatened by a
   third party. Veronica and Logan/Duncan! Jane and Michael/Rafael!
   Meredith and Derek/Addison! Buffy and Angel/Spike! Elena and
   Stefan/Damon! The “now they’re unhappy” stage is often miserable, but
   when it really works, a good love triangle can provide narrative juice
   for weeks, powering countless “next week on” promos and thousands of
   pages of fanfic.

   The Aftermath

   The wedding.
   If they’re long-standing enough, TV relationships tend to run in waves
   — union, breakup, reunion; happy, sad, happy. Once you’ve hit the
   love-triangle phase, or you’ve spent some time together but unhappy,
   it’s probably time to turn things around again, and one frequent method
   is a big engagement/wedding plot. Jim and Pam (The Office), Lily and
   Marshall (How I Met Your Mother), Callie and Arizona (Grey’s Anatomy),
   the several Parenthood weddings, Ben and Leslie (Parks and Rec) —
   especially on a network show, there’s nothing like a TV wedding for
   some Nielsen sweeps TV couple action.

   The marriage.
   Marriage on television works out one of two ways. Either yours is one
   of those rock-solid relationships that forms a reliable backdrop for
   other tensions on the show (with the occasional rocky patch thrown in
   for realism and excitement). This is the marriage of sitcoms and of
   family dramas (there’s always at least one stable couple). The other
   option is a doomed relationship, bound by a show’s need for extreme
   relationship changes to inevitably end in death or divorce. This is
   almost any marriage on a Shonda Rhimes show, and also a good chunk of
   any marriages on “prestige” TV (we can all turn and wave fondly at
   Betty and Megan Draper).

   The new partner.
   When the marriage doesn’t go so well, or if the love triangle has too
   much juice before you even walk down the aisle, protagonists tend to
   jump ship and the whole TV couple cycle starts over again with a new
   person. Sometimes this is the direct follow-up to the love triangle and
   stays entangled with the old relationship, which is how you end up with
   Team Rafael versus Team Michael, people. But sometimes it’s just a
   breakup (or a death) and a new person. First, it was Sam and Diane, of
   course, but then it was Sam and Rebecca. Rory and Logan. Meredith Grey
   and New Hot Doctor.

   And with every new relationship, the TV couple wheel turns again,
   swinging back through will-they-won’t-they territory and circling back
   through the next stages. And yes, it can get repetitive. It’s also one
   of the things that differentiates television from any other medium — TV
   shows, particularly a long-running one, are uniquely suited to portray
   the same lengthy, protracted, familiar-yet-new relationship cycles we
   experience in life. A Grey’s Anatomy relationship timeline is
   undeniably implausible. The not-quite-together-yet Booth and Brennan
   partnership on Bones was drawn out past the point of sense. And yet,
   part of why they resonate so deeply is that their length and twists and
   failures and tragedies and re-beginnings look so much like the
   relationships we know, far more than novels that end in marriage, or
   movies that end with a prom dance.

   So roll your eyes the next time a TV couple gets together and then
   instantly falls apart, and grit your teeth through the next dumb love
   triangle. But celebrate them, too. And keep your fingers crossed for
   Cece and Schmidt.

How Comedy Usurped Drama As the TV Genre of Our Time

   By Matt Zoller Seitz

   As “serious” TV has become plot-obsessed, it’s comedy that’s now
   plumbing the depths of human character — and owning the era.
   Photo-Illustration: Maya Robinson and Photos by Netflix, FX, HBO and CW
   [emmyInsider.png]

   “Where is the telethon for the noble writer?” Gretchen shouts. “Bravely
   drinking coffee, spilling his blood to get his feelings out, filling
   two, maybe three whole pages before his heroic effort is cut short by
   his desire to watch internet porn or get a snack!” This outburst is the
   nerve-jangling high point of “There Is Not Currently a Problem,” an
   episode of the FXX sitcom You’re the Worst; it happens after the
   heroine, Gretchen (Aya Cash), insults her dunderheaded novelist
   boyfriend, Jimmy (Chris Geere), amid a group of friends who can’t leave
   a gathering because the Los Angeles Marathon has blocked off local
   streets. She blasts the other guests for “sucking the air out of the
   room with their self-pity-riddled nonproblems” and caps her tirade by
   slamming one of Jimmy’s hardbacks down on a mouse that Jimmy has been
   chasing; one scene after that, Gretchen is sprawled on a bed, telling a
   friend that she can’t tell her boyfriend that she’s been clinically
   depressed since childhood. The guests euthanize the mouse with carbon
   monoxide by stuffing it in a shoe box affixed to a car’s tailpipe; two
   episodes later, a doom-spiraling Gretchen stalks a more privileged
   happy couple and briefly abducts their infant daughter and their dog.

   In Conversation: Louis C.K.

   You’re the Worst is billed as a comedy. But it’s more accurate to call
   it a CIT — comedy in theory. It runs 30 minutes (minus ads) and boasts
   eccentric, energetic characters. But it’s not consistently light, and
   it shows no interest in being lovable or comforting. Sometimes it’s
   ha-ha funny. Sometimes it’s funny-strange. Other times it’s defiantly
   not funny. When the characters are at their, well, worst, you want to
   avert your eyes, because what they’re going through seems so
   mortifyingly personal and because creator Stephen Falk and his writers
   show their travails in the most unexpected, even alienating manner. If
   you came into “There Is Not Currently a Problem” right after Gretchen’s
   collapse, you might mistake You’re the Worst for a dark drama with
   seriocomic overtones. And if you decided to start watching during the
   episode with the yuppies and their child, you’d assume the show was
   about them, because it starts with their lovemaking and then follows
   them around L.A. for several minutes before revealing Gretchen as a
   supporting character, peeping through the couple’s window.

   We’ve left the age of Difficult Men — to borrow the title of Brett
   Martin’s 2013 book about Sopranos–Mad Men–Breaking Bad–style drama —
   and entered an age of Difficult Shows. You’re the Worst, Orange Is the
   New Black, Lady Dynamite, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None,
   The Carmichael Show, Jane the Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Baskets,
   Veep, Silicon Valley, Archer, Catastrophe, Mom, Black-ish, Fresh Off
   the Boat — there’s infinitely more tonal and aesthetic variety in these
   mostly-funny-but-not-always comedies than in any comparable list of
   dramas you could put together. Even a short list gives you a sense of
   the extraordinary variety and vitality. HBO’s controversy-magnet Girls,
   about North Brooklyn hipsters blundering their way toward maturity,
   features tearful arguments, awkward-explicit sex, and explosions of
   rage that teeter on the edge of physical violence (see season five’s
   finale, in which Jemima Kirke’s Jessa and Adam Driver’s Adam destroy an
   apartment during a fight). Louis C.K.’s self-distributed, limited-run
   barroom-ensemble piece Horace and Pete — the follow-up to his formally
   innovative FX program, Louie, itself a consummate example of a CIT —
   looked like a 1970s-era three-camera sitcom, but it turned out to be a
   heart-ripping kitchen-sink theater production, with subplots about
   mental illness, domestic violence, and infidelity playing out in
   monologues (including an eight-minute showstopper delivered in close-up
   by guest star Laurie Metcalf).

   You’re the Worst and Netflix’s BoJack Horseman tackle depression
   head-on, more brutally than most dramas; the latter is outwardly an
   animated showbiz satire set in a world where anthropomorphized
   creatures jostle against humans, but with each passing season, its
   fascination with narcissism and delusion makes it feel like the
   continuation of Mad Men by other means. Silicon Valley and Veep are
   more stinging in their critiques of power centers (respectively, the
   Northern California tech scene and Washington, D.C.) than their
   dramatic analogues Halt and Catch Fire and House of Cards. Netflix’s
   Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, starring Ellie Kemper as a woman raised in a
   religious cult, is as joke-filled as a show can be, but it’s also about
   somebody recovering from something so horrific that if the show were a
   drama, it might be too bleak to watch (Hulu’s The Path, about members
   of a present-day religious cult, essentially lives within the past that
   Kimmy left behind — and it’s a tough sit, to put it mildly). Amazon’s
   Transparent, starring Jeffrey Tambor as a Southern California patriarch
   transitioning from male to female, is a half-hour show that
   superficially suggests a single-camera, movie-styled sitcom. But after
   one or two episodes, it too becomes as hard to fix with a reductive
   label as its main character. It jumps around in time and alternates
   sensitive but droll comedy with painful scenes where characters
   confront their delusions, prejudices, and untreated emotional wounds.

   This revolution is just as important as the one that reshaped TV drama
   after The Sopranos, but it has happened mostly under the media’s radar,
   maybe because so much attention was focused on whether there would ever
   be a proper successor to the adventures of Don Draper or Walter White.
   That so many of the most fascinating half-hour shows feature racially
   mixed and gender-balanced casts — in contrast to male-driven, often
   violence-filled dramas —is a big reason why. Horace and Pete, Netflix’s
   Master of None, Black-ish, The Mindy Project, Fresh Off the Boat,
   Transparent, and The Carmichael Show explore contemporary social issues
   in ways that most dramas just aren’t built to do (especially the period
   ones). Ten years ago, you never would have anything like the recent
   Mindy Project episode where Mindy Kaling’s heroine, an Indian-American
   doctor, defends herself against another Indian-American’s accusation
   that she’s a “coconut” — brown on the outside, white on the inside — or
   the episode of Master of None in which Aziz Ansari’s hero confronts the
   same harsh reality of racially insensitive casting that once made shows
   like Ansari’s unbankable. Nor would you have seen anything like Horace
   and Pete’s “rapid response” jokes about Donald Trump’s candidacy and
   the Hulk Hogan–Gawker case, which were possible only because the show
   was a low-budget labor of love, each episode written and shot in the
   span of a week. Showrunners have availed themselves of every tool in an
   overstuffed creative kit, unleashing a rainbow spectrum of comedic
   approaches and focusing the spotlight on women, people of color, gay,
   bisexual, and transgendered characters, and beleaguered white men who
   are more anxious than glamorous. And they’ve given writers and
   directors the freedom to confound loyal viewers who know to expect the
   unexpected.

   To what do we owe this great flowering of possibility? One factor is
   distribution. There’s a precedent for creative restlessness in TV
   comedy, but it never had much of a legacy because until fairly recently
   shows had to be across-the-board mainstream hits to get renewed. That
   meant for every truly original sitcom like Seinfeld or The Simpsons
   that ran for years on a network, or The Larry Sanders Show, which
   enjoyed six seasons under the protection of ad-free HBO, you had many
   critically acclaimed flameouts, like NBC’s Buffalo Bill (1983–84), a
   Dabney Coleman vehicle about a hateful daytime-talk-show host; ABC’s
   Hooperman (1987–89), a single-camera John Ritter cop show for which the
   term dramedy was coined; and CBS’s Frank’s Place (1987–1988), a
   single-camera, laugh-track-free sitcom with a predominantly
   African-American cast that looked like a high-quality Hollywood feature
   and had a bluesy, lived-in feeling that mainstream ’80s audiences
   couldn’t process. Even the more tonally adventurous comedies, including
   Norman Lear’s socially aware sitcoms and MTM’s WKRP in Cincinnati, were
   more regimented in their approach, rarely throwing audiences curveballs
   so intimidating that they wondered what they were looking at. The
   fragmenting of TV audiences in the age of cable and streaming has been
   a boon for artists and rebels. It means that it takes fewer eyeballs to
   make a show a “hit.”

   Another factor is emphasis: Most dramas are plot-driven, stringing
   audiences from revelation to revelation, whereas comedies are
   character-driven. Game of Thrones, Empire, The Americans, Mr. Robot,
   Homeland, House of Cards, and the Shondaland shows (How to Get Away
   With Murder, Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy) are all about their twists, and
   they’re strategic about giving characters pretty basic motivations,
   such as a thirst for power, money, or validation. But comedies like
   Girls, Transparent, BoJack Horseman, and Catastrophe focus on unpacking
   their characters’ demented psychology, and they often detour into
   narrative cul-de-sacs (see the Girls episode about Shoshanna in Japan).

   Distinctions that once delineated the comedy-drama divide — hero versus
   anti-hero; classical structure versus experimental or improvised
   storytelling; 60 versus 30 minutes — mean little, and this applies to
   hour-long shows as well as half-hours. Just as Girls, You’re the Worst,
   and short-lived but acclaimed half-hour shows like Togetherness were
   billed as comedies but often played like dramas, the Breaking Bad
   follow-up Better Call Saul runs in an hour time slot, features many of
   Bad’s characters, and boasts periodic eruptions of violence, but it’s
   at least five-sixths a patient, introspective character comedy. Another
   hour-long series, the CW’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, is a weekly musical
   comedy that’s as discomfiting as You’re the Worst or BoJack Horseman.
   It stars Rachel Bloom as a lawyer who left a lucrative job in New York
   City to chase an ex-boyfriend in West Covina, California, and must now
   confront the possibility that she’s not the plucky, lovelorn heroine in
   one of the rom-coms she loves so much but a villain: “the bitch in the
   corner of the poster.”

   I’ve often urged people to watch series along the lines of You’re the
   Worst only to have them grouse later that it upset them: “You call that
   a comedy?” one asked. CIT is admittedly not an inviting acronym — it
   sounds like you’re describing a failure rather than a show that
   achieves precisely what it sets out to do — but what else can we call
   such odd ducks? All this innovating has been hell for the Emmys, where
   shows like Orange have actually switched categories; Louis C.K. has
   reportedly submitted Horace and Pete as a drama. We may be headed
   toward a future where the labels “comedy” and “drama” and “hour” and
   “half-hour” no longer tell us anything useful about a show, and we’ll
   have to think about them, live with them, in order to figure out what
   they are. No joke.

The 10 Best Rom-Com Tributes in The Mindy Project

   By Maggie Fremont

   Photo: Isabella Vosmikova/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images

   The Mindy Project never met a rom-com trope it didn’t like. Mere
   minutes into the pilot episode, Dr. Mindy Lahiri exclaimed, “I’m Sandra
   Bullock!” The majority of its characters have participated in some form
   of dramatic rom-com run. (In the best iteration, Jeremy ran in the rain
   all the way to his best friend, Dr. Jody Kimball-Kenny, before Jody
   leaves for Africa.) The show even gave its parade of love interests
   very rom-com jobs: Seth Meyers was an architect, Allison Williams
   showed up as an oceanographer, and Anders Holm played everyone’s
   favorite pastor-slash-DJ. Sure, there isn’t an actual rom-com about a
   doctor falling for a pastor-slash-DJ, but I would totally pay good
   money for one. (It would be called Heartbeats and the tagline would be
   #Blessed.)

   Beyond playing with rom-com tropes, The Mindy Project also paid homage
   to many of the genre’s modern classics. (Yes, How to Lose a Guy in 10
   Days is considered a classic in this scenario.) Now the series finale
   has aired — and Mindy Lahiri, inventor of Wreath Witherspoon, finally
   got the happy ending she’s always wanted — Vulture is looking back at
   the show’s greatest tributes to her favorite type of movies. As The
   Mindy Project proves, one can be completely in love with something and
   also be able to poke fun at its ridiculousness.

   The Mindy Project Finale: ‘She Gets What She Needs, Not What She Wants’

When Harry Met Sally…

   Easily the most name-checked rom-com on The Mindy Project. This makes
   sense since Mindy and Danny are basically Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) and
   Harry Burns (Billy Crystal), two friends who bicker with each other
   until they realize they are completely in love. It’s Mindy favorite
   movie, a movie which Danny refers to as “When Doofus Met Dummy.” Sick
   burn, Castellano. While I’ll never not laugh at Danny paraphrasing
   “I’ll have what she’s having” into “I’ll order whatever gave her an
   orgasm,” the best tribute to the film comes halfway through the first
   season when Latin professor Jamie (B.J. Novak) arrives to woo our
   heroine in the appropriately titled episodes “Harry & Sally” and “Harry
   & Mindy.” Jamie is seemingly perfect for Mindy, except for one tiny
   problem: He has a best friend named Lucy (Eva Amurri), and they are
   clearly in love each other. The two episodes have lots of references to
   the film — the batting cages, a double date gone horribly wrong — and
   in the end, Mindy realizes that she has somehow become the supporting
   character in Jamie and Lucy’s romantic comedy. She is basically Rob
   Reiner’s mother.

   Here’s the real trick, though: While Mindy feels like she’s being edged
   out of a story about two friends finding one another, she is actually
   beginning that same story with Danny. Over the course of those two
   episodes, Mindy and Danny grow closer and closer as friends. At the end
   of the second episode, when Jamie makes a big speech to Lucy after she
   hits it off with Danny on a double date, we’re not paying attention to
   Jamie and Lucy finally hooking up — we’re watching pals Mindy and Danny
   walk off together and share a heartfelt moment of friendship. We’re
   watching the beginning of Mindy and Danny’s story.

Bridget Jones’s Diary

   The Mindy Project never did a specific homage to the movie adaptation
   of Bridget Jones’s Diary (itself a Pride and Prejudice adaptation), but
   the show screams Bridget Jones from the pilot: the voice-over, Mindy’s
   obsession with her weight, the vivid fantasy life, her weird group of
   cohorts, the fact that she’s smart and somehow good at her job even
   though she is a scorching hot mess. And don’t forget about her choice
   of suitors: In the pilot, Mindy is hooking up with Jeremy, your basic
   Daniel Cleaver–esque English Lothario. On the other hand, there’s Danny
   Castellano. He’s terse, thinks he’s smarter than everyone, and he finds
   Mindy ridiculous until he gets to know her. (Okay, he still finds her
   ridiculous after that, but he is charmed by that ridiculousness.) Put
   the guy in an ugly reindeer sweater and you’ve got yourself Mark Darcy.
   So it comes as no surprise that the book Mindy turns to when she’s not
   feeling well is Bridget Jones’s Diary. In season two’s “Indian BBW,”
   after Danny and Mindy have been dating in secret and both wind up in
   the hospital with viral meningitis, Danny makes a very swoony gesture
   by getting into Mindy’s hospital bed and reading from her favorite
   book. He even does the voices. And that’s how Danny Castellano got the
   nickname Tiny Italian Mark Darcy. Or, at least, he should have.

Pretty Woman

   Season one hit the rom-com tropes pretty hard, typically by taking a
   romantic-comedy premise and letting it blow up in Mindy Lahiri’s face.
   Many rom-com premises would be terrifying if placed into the real
   world, and The Mindy Project is at its best when it exposes those types
   of truths, like its role-reversal take on Pretty Woman. In “Pretty
   Man,” Mindy accidentally sleeps with a prostitute named Adam (Josh
   Meyers) and he is no Julia Roberts. The guy is very into kissing,
   giving him a wardrobe makeover isn’t as fun as Mindy hopes, and he
   writes some offensive original music. (That last one has nothing to do
   with Pretty Woman, but it is a perfectly crafted cringeworthy moment
   and deserves recognition.) This experience with Adam is yet another
   blow to Mindy’s rom-com-loving heart. As much as she may want to be,
   Mindy Lahiri is no Richard Gere.

Sleepless in Seattle

   It’s all about the Empire State Building, you guys. The big romantic
   conclusion of Nora Ephron’s masterpiece about the magic of falling in
   love takes place at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine’s
   Day. After lots of shenanigans, American standards, and cross-country
   plane tickets, Tom Hanks’s sad hot dad Sam Baldwin lays eyes on Meg
   Ryan’s impeccably coiffed Annie Reed for the first time on top of that
   giant building and they just know they are meant for each other. Tom
   Hanks reaches out his hand toward Meg Ryan, asks “Shall we?”, and we
   are all left swooning as they take the elevator down to the ground
   floor. They don’t even kiss and it is still one of the most romantic
   scenes of all time.

   No wonder Mindy Lahiri is obsessed with finding true love at the Empire
   State Building. She is so obsessed, in fact, that she spends time
   hanging out in the lobby waiting to bump into Mr. Right. Of course, she
   ends up getting arrested out of fear that she’s a terrorist (saying
   things like “Boom, fireworks” and “I am a true believer” don’t help her
   situation), but that doesn’t dash Mindy’s hopes of finding love at her
   most sacred of places. She has such a reverence for the Empire State
   Building that when B.J. Novak’s character wants to take her up to the
   top for a romantic Valentine’s Day date in “Harry & Mindy,” she
   refuses, because she knows he’s actually in love with someone else. It
   would be offensive to go up there with him. Of course, that reverence
   also makes it the perfect place for Mindy and Danny to officially get
   together. In this scenario, though, Mindy has to take the stairs all
   the way to the top, so she is a sweaty shell of a human when Danny
   finds her lying on the ground. Even still, their makeout sesh is just
   as swoon-worthy as Tom and Meg’s hand-holding elevator ride.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

   The premise of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is perfect rom-com fodder:
   Andie Anderson (of course that’s her name) is a magazine writer (of
   course that’s her job) who’s writing an article about the things women
   do that make men want to break up with them. And so she chooses Matthew
   McConaughey’s smooth ad dude, Benjamin Barry (!) as her unwitting
   accomplice and they end up falling love. Basically, it’s a movie about
   how Andie sucks at her job but looks great in a yellow dress. Mindy
   takes the How to Lose a Guy premise in season two’s “French Me, You
   Idiot” and uses it to get her boyfriend Cliff (Glenn Howerton) to dump
   her so that she can be with Danny. She tries going to the bathroom with
   the door open, telling Cliff that her psychic told her they’d have
   eight kids but she only wants six, and the classic: “If you break up
   with me, I’ll kill you and all of your friends.” None of these work.
   You know what does? Mindy and Danny almost burning down the church
   during Cliff’s grandmother’s funeral as they secretly make out in the
   back. Kate Hudson never tried that!

Groundhog Day

   Season five’s “Hot Mess Time Machine” homage to Groundhog Day is pretty
   much right on: Mindy wakes up to the same song every morning (Sonny and
   Cher’s “I Got You, Babe” is replaced by Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me
   Maybe”), spends the beginning iterations of her day living the high
   life once she realizes there are no consequences to her actions (for
   Mindy, this means breaking into vending machines and spending $100,000
   on lunch dates with Oscar Isaac), until she realizes, like Phil Connors
   before her, that this time loop is all about love. In other words,
   Mindy needs to win back Nurse Ben (Bryan Greenberg). It is the perfect
   rom-com for The Mindy Project to parody, because, let’s face it, Mindy
   Lahiri is pretty much Phil Connors. Ultimately, she has to overcome her
   selfishness and win over Ben by actually listening to him and
   considering his feelings for once. That X-Men Storm costume doesn’t
   hurt, either.

Say Anything…

   There are so many memorable moments in the John Cusack ’80s classic
   about lovesick Lloyd Dobler: “I gave her my heart and she gave me a
   pen.” Lloyd’s epic speech about not wanting to sell anything, buy
   anything, or process anything as a career. And every Say Anything fan
   thinks about the movie while waiting for the “fasten seat belt” sign to
   turn off during a flight. But, of course, the biggest moment is Lloyd’s
   grand gesture: He shows up outside Diane Court’s window, and holds up a
   boom box blasting “In Your Eyes.” The Mindy Project, a show obsessed
   with grand gestures, does a twist on this scene twice. In season one’s
   “Harry & Sally,” Danny tries to win back oceanographer Jillian (Allison
   Williams) by showing up at her work with a stereo (which he has Morgan
   hold), but he winds up blasting Korn instead of Natalie Imbruglia’s
   “Torn.” This does not work as well as Lloyd’s romantic serenade. But
   even when a Mindy character gets “In Your Eyes” correct, the rest of
   the gesture goes horribly wrong. See Cliff’s attempt to make amends
   with Mindy in season two’s “French Me, You Idiot.” He uses “In Your
   Eyes,” but it’s played by a live mariachi band at 6 a.m. in her
   apartment hallway because, come on, that’s hilarious.

13 Going on 30/Sliding Doors

   We’re combining these two films because that is exactly what happens in
   season four’s premiere “While I Was Sleeping.” (Hey, that’s another
   rom-com!) In 13 Going on 30, teenage Jenna wishes she was a cool
   30-year-old and wakes up as Jennifer Garner with her dream life, only
   she comes to realize her dream life isn’t so dreamy after all. (But she
   does get an entire room of snobby fashionistas to do the Thriller
   dance, and if that isn’t a true accomplishment, I don’t know what is.)
   In Sliding Doors, we watch Gwyneth Paltrow live out two parallel lives,
   one in which she catches a train, dumps her cheating boyfriend, meets
   her soul mate, and after a big kiss in the rain, gets hit by a van and
   dies. In her other life, she misses that train, is stuck with the
   cheating boyfriend, and falls down a flight of stairs, but eventually
   runs into that soul mate at the end. So yeah, not exactly a comedy.

   In the Mindy version, Mindy is upset that Danny will never propose,
   goes to bed wishing she had fallen for someone else, and when she wakes
   up, she’s married to Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Matt, a very handsome Real
   Housewives producer. As it turns out, they got together on that fated
   Danny and Mindy makeout flight, only this time Danny never ran to the
   back of the plane to tell Mindy how he felt. She instead winds up
   meeting Matt, who comes out of the bathroom and mistakes her for a
   small Native American man. Though things seems ideal at first (also,
   Kaling and JGL’s chemistry is off the charts), Mindy realizes Danny is
   the one she loves, and she professes her love to him in the rain, and
   then gets hit by a bus. Mindy wakes up back in the universe we know and
   love. Danny finally proposes, and Mindy is not a 13-year-old who has an
   addiction to Razzles.

You’ve Got Mail

   Season two’s finale, “Danny and Mindy,” has lovely references to
   Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally, but it is overwhelmingly
   and wonderfully a tribute to You’ve Got Mail. Since Danny has screwed
   things up with Mindy, he needs to find a way to win her back. He does
   this by pretending to be a hot dude who had a moment with Mindy on the
   subway — connecting with her over email, of course. Meanwhile, he’s
   also trying his best to be her friend again. You know, not unlike Joe
   Fox (Tom Hanks) trying to win over Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), the
   independent bookstore owner he’s put out of business, who also happens
   to be the woman he met online and fell madly in love with, the Shopgirl
   to his NY152. There are lots of scenes of Mindy and Danny writing to
   one another, he comes over and sits on her bed when she’s sick, they
   walk all over New York City together: all shots that could be taken
   directly out of Ephron’s original film. Danny’s plan doesn’t go as
   smoothly as Joe Fox’s, but let’s be real: No one does it like Tom
   Hanks.

Truth in Comedy After Louis C.K.

   By Jesse David Fox

   Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Comedy Central

   In 2015, while working on the first installment of Vulture’s “100 Jokes
   That Shaped Modern Comedy,” there was a small debate among the team of
   comedians, comedy historians, and comedy journalists assembled to work
   on the project. I say debate, but actually, everyone was pretty much in
   agreement: A Bill Cosby joke should make the list. We reasoned, it is a
   list of jokes first, not a list of the comedians who tell them
   (especially since some jokes on the list were told by multiple people),
   which detached it slightly from each person. But more so, Bill Cosby is
   a cancer in the body of history of American comedy that you can’t
   neatly cut out. He codified a style of long stories, loosely told and
   filled with jokes that inspired a generation of comedians, who in turn
   inspired another generation. Although the ink hasn’t dried on how we
   write about Cosby, his work, and his life, it has on his impact on
   comedy.

   The former is true for Louis C.K., but the latter isn’t. With the New
   York Times bringing to light C.K’s sexual misconduct against female
   comedians, and C.K. admitting the allegations are true, it makes you
   rethink the last 15 years of stand-up comedy, an era that he largely
   defined.

   The Controversial Episode of Louie That Now Plays Like a Confessional

   “Truth in comedy” is an expression out of the improv world, but it
   generally is held as a tenet for stand-up as well. Louis C.K. was the
   contemporary hero of that philosophy. There was even a bit of modern
   comedy legend around it: Not unlike the story of young Richard Pryor
   disappearing after a show in Las Vegas by saying “What the fuck am I
   doing here?” and eventually reemerging as the dirty, political, honest
   comedian who generally is considered the greatest stand-up ever, the
   tale about Louis C.K. went as follows: He was a struggling absurdist
   until he decided to (1) create a new hour-long set every year, and (2)
   make his act more personal. The takeaway from the legend was that Louis
   C.K. gave the audience something more raw than they’ve experienced
   before, pushing the boundaries of “truth in comedy.”

   Was this true? Kind of. Richard Pryor changed the game, talking about
   the roughest parts of his life, whether it was growing up in a
   whorehouse or freebasing cocaine, but it took another couple decades
   before comedians pushed the level of honesty much further. To quickly
   sum it up, the ’90s brought what became known as alternative comedy,
   which was defined by its lack of polish, both in terms of unfiltered
   material and unprofessional settings. It was best defined by two venues
   named Luna (New York’s Luna Lounge and L.A.’s Luna Park) and two shows,
   New York’s Eating It and L.A.’s UnCabaret. The comedians most
   associated with both spaces, but especially Beth Lapides’s UnCabaret,
   were women like Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney, Margaret Cho, and Janeane
   Garofalo. There were definitely men in both scenes, but the difference
   is that the male comics merely liked or preferred those spaces, while
   the female comedians needed it because of how historically unsupportive
   comedy clubs were toward them. In that vein, these scenes also had men
   who deliberately did both alternative rooms and comedy clubs because it
   made them better comedians. Louis C.K. is the most famous example.
   Unlike a Marc Maron, who generally stayed true to the ethos of those
   alternative rooms, C.K. found a way to appropriate the truth-first
   comedy pioneered by female comics for a more aggressive, more masculine
   comedy-club audience. His comedy wasn’t just truthful; it was brutally
   honest. He took the sensitivity of those rooms and used it to tell dick
   jokes. And that was revolutionary.

   Over on the Cut, Anna Silman put together a list of all the times — and
   there were a lot — that Louis C.K. joked about masturbation, including
   arguably one of his most famous jokes. From his 2008 special, Chewed
   Up:

     “I need to cum, I need to — cumming is a need, I came the first time
     when I was 12 and I haven’t skipped a day. I cum every day and I
     fucked maybe 20 times in my life so. It’s just been me doing most of
     the work and I really — you know, I jerk off way too much and it
     upsets me and I don’t know why. Maybe ’cause it’s so selfish, I
     don’t know what it is, but I know it’s bad, I know I’m hurting
     somebody somewhere. There’s something wrong with — I was thinking
     the other day, that you can figure out how bad — how bad a person
     you are by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like, how
     long you waited? And for me it was between the two buildings going
     down.”

These Louis C.K. Jokes Aren't So Funny Anymore

   For this, he was considered the greatest living comedian by many
   critics, comedy fans, and, most importantly, other comedians. So much
   so, comedians like Jerry Seinfeld were criticized for merely performing
   well-written jokes they’d been working on for years. Most young comics
   start out trying to be one of their heroes and for the last 15 years,
   for many, especially men, that meant doing their version of C.K. Go to
   an open mic in any city and you’ll see a few dudes talking about how
   disgusting they are because of this thing about their dick or that
   thing about their dick. C.K. became a standard-bearer for what good
   comedy was and, in turn, what it meant to be honest onstage. Honesty
   itself was fetishized.

   The thing is, C.K. wasn’t being honest onstage when he was selling out
   theaters (and later, arenas). Part of this is structural: C.K. works
   doggedly on material, manipulating his stories to be as funny as
   possible. All comedians do this, especially by the time you can buy
   tickets to see them. What C.K. learned from those alternative spaces,
   the darker your act seems, the more likely the audience think it really
   happened. He achieved this by going inside his psyche, or at least
   appearing to. Where Pryor found comedy in the darkness of his life,
   C.K. revealed the darkness in his head. He would tell us that he tries
   to be a good dad, but he still thinks one of his daughters is an
   asshole, to reference one of his most famous bits. Or take another
   well-known one: “Of course … but maybe,” where he walks the audience
   through all of his bad thoughts and they laugh because they’ve also had
   negative thoughts that aren’t tied to how they live or act as people.
   But Louis C.K. acted on his. That’s the truth he didn’t share with us.
   Considering his prominence in comedy and the prominence of honesty in
   his act, it makes you rethink all supposedly truthful comedy of the
   last 15 years. It makes it harder to hear a comedian say, “This really
   happened,” and believe them.

   C.K.’s act was lauded for being confessional, but here’s the thing
   about confessing: It is a selfish act. You are revealing bad things
   about yourself, in exchange for absolution. As my colleague Matt Zoller
   Seitz wrote, “It’s a power move, rooted in the thrill of subterfuge and
   shock: an artist’s version of indecent exposure.” It’s hard not to see
   parallels between C.K.’s offstage behavior and his act, but it’s not
   just his act. You can also see it in the acts he influenced. I see it
   in my favorite comedians of the last decade, personally, and the
   comedians I’ve celebrated professionally. Pete Holmes is gentler and
   less clubby than C.K., and comes off as extraordinarily nice for a
   comic, but he has a joke about masturbating while having phone sex with
   a partner that I loved at the time I heard it, and I now question my
   own feelings about it as a comedy fan and journalist. I bring this up
   not to implicate Holmes in any way, but to examine how I viewed comedy
   for the last decade, and how we will look back on the comedy C.K.
   influenced.

   With the story about this era of comedy unfinished, I do not want to
   remove C.K. and his influence without offering a replacement — another
   comedian or two who can reframe and reorient how we’ve thought of truth
   in comedy in the 21st century. Five years ago, Tig Notaro was not
   confessing to the audience when she told them she had cancer. She was
   sharing. She was giving her tragedy to the audience, acting as a
   surrogate to life’s darkness and telling us that it’s okay to laugh at
   it. For the last 20 years, Maria Bamford was not confessing her
   struggles so that an audience would tell her that she’s okay. She was
   purposefully trying to destigmatize talking about mental illness in
   polite society. Both Notaro and Bamford use their act and their truth
   to help their audience, to improve society. Both Notaro and Bamford are
   tremendously influential to a younger generation of comedians. Both
   Notaro and Bamford are two of the greatest comedians working today.
   What if we defined this era around them? You can judge for yourself.
   Notaro is performing in L.A. tonight. Bamford is in Portsmouth, New
   Hampshire. Go see them.

The 8 Stages of a TV Couple, From ‘Will-They-Won’t-They’ to ‘OMG, They Did’

   By Kathryn VanArendonk

   For the next three weeks, Vulture is holding a TV Couple Scuffle to
   determine the greatest couple on television in the past 30 years.
   (Today, Heather Havrilesky will decide whether Friday Night Lights’
   Tami and Eric Taylor or The Sopranos’ Tony and Carmela will move on to
   the next round.) Below, Kathryn VanArendonk breaks down the many
   relationship stages a TV couple cycles through.

   Like the prehistoric apes and fans of the first season of Heroes,
   couple-dom on TV often follows a regular, inevitable evolution. We
   often love romantic relationships on TV at some specific, distinct
   stages, but if a show is on long enough (or if it burns through plot
   quickly), most TV couples will live through several iterations of
   narrative pairing, oscillating between driving the main story and
   taking a backseat to other plots.

   Not all couples will follow this trajectory, and some of the best and
   most interesting are those who break the rules. There are also many who
   begin at a later stage. But for most shows, this is what the default
   life path of a romantic pairing looks like, a timeline suitable for
   examination, so you can prep yourself for when Cece and Schmidt
   inexorably move into post-marriage conflict phase.

   The Together Phase

   The will-they-won’t-they.
   This is one of the most familiar, and most treacherous, stages in a TV
   couple’s life. It’s a device that crosses genres and decades, defining
   sitcoms and dramas, vampire shows and workplace comedies, and police
   procedurals and family melodramas alike. Moonlighting is perhaps the
   best-known example of a show where the couple (and the show) could not
   survive the transition past romantic consummation, but it’s often
   considered a turning point even in shows that go on for several more
   years. Remember when Castle was kind of fun? Yeah. In some of the best
   TV relationships, though, this is just the first, headiest stage of the
   relationship, full of sexy glances and meaningful stares and live
   studio audiences making the wooooOOOOooo sound.

   The OMG, they did.
   Many TV couples never make it past the will-they-won’t-they. The West
   Wing ends at the precise moment Donna and Josh get together. If they do
   survive, though, there’s a brief, confusing, sometimes giddy, and often
   fraught stage where everyone tries to adjust to the new paradigm. On
   Friends, it’s Phoebe and Joey playing a high-stakes game of chicken
   about who knows that Chandler and Monica are together. On Gilmore
   Girls, it’s Rory and Lorelai going on a double date so awful that they
   have to break out the Bop-It.

   They’re together now, time to find some other story lines.
   This is the moment when you really hope that your favorite TV couple is
   on a show that also has plenty of other stuff going on. Just as in real
   life, TV relationships often need some space to breathe, and it’s a
   good opportunity for a show to shift to some other plots while the
   happy couple spends some time being happy together. (Happiness is great
   in real life; happiness is usually pretty boring in fiction.) Corey and
   Topanga got together on Boy Meets World — time to tell some Shawn
   stories! If the couple is really the main juice going on in a show,
   though, hold on to your horses, because it’ll be time to move straight
   into …

   The Breakup Phase

   They’re together now, time to make them unhappy.
   After the will-they-won’t-they, this may be the most familiar (and most
   frustrating) stage in any TV couple relationship. When your series
   hinges on the dramatic tension of one specific character, continued
   conflict is inevitable. You may recognize this stage as Ross and
   Rachel’s “We were on a break!”; basically all of Hannah and Adam’s
   relationship on Girls; Pam’s stint at art school and, later, the
   Michael Scott Paper Company on The Office; and the arrival of Addison
   on Grey’s Anatomy. Speaking of which …

   The love triangle.
   Technically, this stage can (and frequently does) happen in the
   will-they-won’t-they phase, but it’s often at its most potent after two
   characters have finally gotten together and are now threatened by a
   third party. Veronica and Logan/Duncan! Jane and Michael/Rafael!
   Meredith and Derek/Addison! Buffy and Angel/Spike! Elena and
   Stefan/Damon! The “now they’re unhappy” stage is often miserable, but
   when it really works, a good love triangle can provide narrative juice
   for weeks, powering countless “next week on” promos and thousands of
   pages of fanfic.

   The Aftermath

   The wedding.
   If they’re long-standing enough, TV relationships tend to run in waves
   — union, breakup, reunion; happy, sad, happy. Once you’ve hit the
   love-triangle phase, or you’ve spent some time together but unhappy,
   it’s probably time to turn things around again, and one frequent method
   is a big engagement/wedding plot. Jim and Pam (The Office), Lily and
   Marshall (How I Met Your Mother), Callie and Arizona (Grey’s Anatomy),
   the several Parenthood weddings, Ben and Leslie (Parks and Rec) —
   especially on a network show, there’s nothing like a TV wedding for
   some Nielsen sweeps TV couple action.

   The marriage.
   Marriage on television works out one of two ways. Either yours is one
   of those rock-solid relationships that forms a reliable backdrop for
   other tensions on the show (with the occasional rocky patch thrown in
   for realism and excitement). This is the marriage of sitcoms and of
   family dramas (there’s always at least one stable couple). The other
   option is a doomed relationship, bound by a show’s need for extreme
   relationship changes to inevitably end in death or divorce. This is
   almost any marriage on a Shonda Rhimes show, and also a good chunk of
   any marriages on “prestige” TV (we can all turn and wave fondly at
   Betty and Megan Draper).

   The new partner.
   When the marriage doesn’t go so well, or if the love triangle has too
   much juice before you even walk down the aisle, protagonists tend to
   jump ship and the whole TV couple cycle starts over again with a new
   person. Sometimes this is the direct follow-up to the love triangle and
   stays entangled with the old relationship, which is how you end up with
   Team Rafael versus Team Michael, people. But sometimes it’s just a
   breakup (or a death) and a new person. First, it was Sam and Diane, of
   course, but then it was Sam and Rebecca. Rory and Logan. Meredith Grey
   and New Hot Doctor.

   And with every new relationship, the TV couple wheel turns again,
   swinging back through will-they-won’t-they territory and circling back
   through the next stages. And yes, it can get repetitive. It’s also one
   of the things that differentiates television from any other medium — TV
   shows, particularly a long-running one, are uniquely suited to portray
   the same lengthy, protracted, familiar-yet-new relationship cycles we
   experience in life. A Grey’s Anatomy relationship timeline is
   undeniably implausible. The not-quite-together-yet Booth and Brennan
   partnership on Bones was drawn out past the point of sense. And yet,
   part of why they resonate so deeply is that their length and twists and
   failures and tragedies and re-beginnings look so much like the
   relationships we know, far more than novels that end in marriage, or
   movies that end with a prom dance.

   So roll your eyes the next time a TV couple gets together and then
   instantly falls apart, and grit your teeth through the next dumb love
   triangle. But celebrate them, too. And keep your fingers crossed for
   Cece and Schmidt.

How Comedy Usurped Drama As the TV Genre of Our Time

   By Matt Zoller Seitz

   As “serious” TV has become plot-obsessed, it’s comedy that’s now
   plumbing the depths of human character — and owning the era.
   Photo-Illustration: Maya Robinson and Photos by Netflix, FX, HBO and CW
   [emmyInsider.png]

   “Where is the telethon for the noble writer?” Gretchen shouts. “Bravely
   drinking coffee, spilling his blood to get his feelings out, filling
   two, maybe three whole pages before his heroic effort is cut short by
   his desire to watch internet porn or get a snack!” This outburst is the
   nerve-jangling high point of “There Is Not Currently a Problem,” an
   episode of the FXX sitcom You’re the Worst; it happens after the
   heroine, Gretchen (Aya Cash), insults her dunderheaded novelist
   boyfriend, Jimmy (Chris Geere), amid a group of friends who can’t leave
   a gathering because the Los Angeles Marathon has blocked off local
   streets. She blasts the other guests for “sucking the air out of the
   room with their self-pity-riddled nonproblems” and caps her tirade by
   slamming one of Jimmy’s hardbacks down on a mouse that Jimmy has been
   chasing; one scene after that, Gretchen is sprawled on a bed, telling a
   friend that she can’t tell her boyfriend that she’s been clinically
   depressed since childhood. The guests euthanize the mouse with carbon
   monoxide by stuffing it in a shoe box affixed to a car’s tailpipe; two
   episodes later, a doom-spiraling Gretchen stalks a more privileged
   happy couple and briefly abducts their infant daughter and their dog.

   In Conversation: Louis C.K.

   You’re the Worst is billed as a comedy. But it’s more accurate to call
   it a CIT — comedy in theory. It runs 30 minutes (minus ads) and boasts
   eccentric, energetic characters. But it’s not consistently light, and
   it shows no interest in being lovable or comforting. Sometimes it’s
   ha-ha funny. Sometimes it’s funny-strange. Other times it’s defiantly
   not funny. When the characters are at their, well, worst, you want to
   avert your eyes, because what they’re going through seems so
   mortifyingly personal and because creator Stephen Falk and his writers
   show their travails in the most unexpected, even alienating manner. If
   you came into “There Is Not Currently a Problem” right after Gretchen’s
   collapse, you might mistake You’re the Worst for a dark drama with
   seriocomic overtones. And if you decided to start watching during the
   episode with the yuppies and their child, you’d assume the show was
   about them, because it starts with their lovemaking and then follows
   them around L.A. for several minutes before revealing Gretchen as a
   supporting character, peeping through the couple’s window.

   We’ve left the age of Difficult Men — to borrow the title of Brett
   Martin’s 2013 book about Sopranos–Mad Men–Breaking Bad–style drama —
   and entered an age of Difficult Shows. You’re the Worst, Orange Is the
   New Black, Lady Dynamite, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None,
   The Carmichael Show, Jane the Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Baskets,
   Veep, Silicon Valley, Archer, Catastrophe, Mom, Black-ish, Fresh Off
   the Boat — there’s infinitely more tonal and aesthetic variety in these
   mostly-funny-but-not-always comedies than in any comparable list of
   dramas you could put together. Even a short list gives you a sense of
   the extraordinary variety and vitality. HBO’s controversy-magnet Girls,
   about North Brooklyn hipsters blundering their way toward maturity,
   features tearful arguments, awkward-explicit sex, and explosions of
   rage that teeter on the edge of physical violence (see season five’s
   finale, in which Jemima Kirke’s Jessa and Adam Driver’s Adam destroy an
   apartment during a fight). Louis C.K.’s self-distributed, limited-run
   barroom-ensemble piece Horace and Pete — the follow-up to his formally
   innovative FX program, Louie, itself a consummate example of a CIT —
   looked like a 1970s-era three-camera sitcom, but it turned out to be a
   heart-ripping kitchen-sink theater production, with subplots about
   mental illness, domestic violence, and infidelity playing out in
   monologues (including an eight-minute showstopper delivered in close-up
   by guest star Laurie Metcalf).

   You’re the Worst and Netflix’s BoJack Horseman tackle depression
   head-on, more brutally than most dramas; the latter is outwardly an
   animated showbiz satire set in a world where anthropomorphized
   creatures jostle against humans, but with each passing season, its
   fascination with narcissism and delusion makes it feel like the
   continuation of Mad Men by other means. Silicon Valley and Veep are
   more stinging in their critiques of power centers (respectively, the
   Northern California tech scene and Washington, D.C.) than their
   dramatic analogues Halt and Catch Fire and House of Cards. Netflix’s
   Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, starring Ellie Kemper as a woman raised in a
   religious cult, is as joke-filled as a show can be, but it’s also about
   somebody recovering from something so horrific that if the show were a
   drama, it might be too bleak to watch (Hulu’s The Path, about members
   of a present-day religious cult, essentially lives within the past that
   Kimmy left behind — and it’s a tough sit, to put it mildly). Amazon’s
   Transparent, starring Jeffrey Tambor as a Southern California patriarch
   transitioning from male to female, is a half-hour show that
   superficially suggests a single-camera, movie-styled sitcom. But after
   one or two episodes, it too becomes as hard to fix with a reductive
   label as its main character. It jumps around in time and alternates
   sensitive but droll comedy with painful scenes where characters
   confront their delusions, prejudices, and untreated emotional wounds.

   This revolution is just as important as the one that reshaped TV drama
   after The Sopranos, but it has happened mostly under the media’s radar,
   maybe because so much attention was focused on whether there would ever
   be a proper successor to the adventures of Don Draper or Walter White.
   That so many of the most fascinating half-hour shows feature racially
   mixed and gender-balanced casts — in contrast to male-driven, often
   violence-filled dramas —is a big reason why. Horace and Pete, Netflix’s
   Master of None, Black-ish, The Mindy Project, Fresh Off the Boat,
   Transparent, and The Carmichael Show explore contemporary social issues
   in ways that most dramas just aren’t built to do (especially the period
   ones). Ten years ago, you never would have anything like the recent
   Mindy Project episode where Mindy Kaling’s heroine, an Indian-American
   doctor, defends herself against another Indian-American’s accusation
   that she’s a “coconut” — brown on the outside, white on the inside — or
   the episode of Master of None in which Aziz Ansari’s hero confronts the
   same harsh reality of racially insensitive casting that once made shows
   like Ansari’s unbankable. Nor would you have seen anything like Horace
   and Pete’s “rapid response” jokes about Donald Trump’s candidacy and
   the Hulk Hogan–Gawker case, which were possible only because the show
   was a low-budget labor of love, each episode written and shot in the
   span of a week. Showrunners have availed themselves of every tool in an
   overstuffed creative kit, unleashing a rainbow spectrum of comedic
   approaches and focusing the spotlight on women, people of color, gay,
   bisexual, and transgendered characters, and beleaguered white men who
   are more anxious than glamorous. And they’ve given writers and
   directors the freedom to confound loyal viewers who know to expect the
   unexpected.

   To what do we owe this great flowering of possibility? One factor is
   distribution. There’s a precedent for creative restlessness in TV
   comedy, but it never had much of a legacy because until fairly recently
   shows had to be across-the-board mainstream hits to get renewed. That
   meant for every truly original sitcom like Seinfeld or The Simpsons
   that ran for years on a network, or The Larry Sanders Show, which
   enjoyed six seasons under the protection of ad-free HBO, you had many
   critically acclaimed flameouts, like NBC’s Buffalo Bill (1983–84), a
   Dabney Coleman vehicle about a hateful daytime-talk-show host; ABC’s
   Hooperman (1987–89), a single-camera John Ritter cop show for which the
   term dramedy was coined; and CBS’s Frank’s Place (1987–1988), a
   single-camera, laugh-track-free sitcom with a predominantly
   African-American cast that looked like a high-quality Hollywood feature
   and had a bluesy, lived-in feeling that mainstream ’80s audiences
   couldn’t process. Even the more tonally adventurous comedies, including
   Norman Lear’s socially aware sitcoms and MTM’s WKRP in Cincinnati, were
   more regimented in their approach, rarely throwing audiences curveballs
   so intimidating that they wondered what they were looking at. The
   fragmenting of TV audiences in the age of cable and streaming has been
   a boon for artists and rebels. It means that it takes fewer eyeballs to
   make a show a “hit.”

   Another factor is emphasis: Most dramas are plot-driven, stringing
   audiences from revelation to revelation, whereas comedies are
   character-driven. Game of Thrones, Empire, The Americans, Mr. Robot,
   Homeland, House of Cards, and the Shondaland shows (How to Get Away
   With Murder, Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy) are all about their twists, and
   they’re strategic about giving characters pretty basic motivations,
   such as a thirst for power, money, or validation. But comedies like
   Girls, Transparent, BoJack Horseman, and Catastrophe focus on unpacking
   their characters’ demented psychology, and they often detour into
   narrative cul-de-sacs (see the Girls episode about Shoshanna in Japan).

   Distinctions that once delineated the comedy-drama divide — hero versus
   anti-hero; classical structure versus experimental or improvised
   storytelling; 60 versus 30 minutes — mean little, and this applies to
   hour-long shows as well as half-hours. Just as Girls, You’re the Worst,
   and short-lived but acclaimed half-hour shows like Togetherness were
   billed as comedies but often played like dramas, the Breaking Bad
   follow-up Better Call Saul runs in an hour time slot, features many of
   Bad’s characters, and boasts periodic eruptions of violence, but it’s
   at least five-sixths a patient, introspective character comedy. Another
   hour-long series, the CW’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, is a weekly musical
   comedy that’s as discomfiting as You’re the Worst or BoJack Horseman.
   It stars Rachel Bloom as a lawyer who left a lucrative job in New York
   City to chase an ex-boyfriend in West Covina, California, and must now
   confront the possibility that she’s not the plucky, lovelorn heroine in
   one of the rom-coms she loves so much but a villain: “the bitch in the
   corner of the poster.”

   I’ve often urged people to watch series along the lines of You’re the
   Worst only to have them grouse later that it upset them: “You call that
   a comedy?” one asked. CIT is admittedly not an inviting acronym — it
   sounds like you’re describing a failure rather than a show that
   achieves precisely what it sets out to do — but what else can we call
   such odd ducks? All this innovating has been hell for the Emmys, where
   shows like Orange have actually switched categories; Louis C.K. has
   reportedly submitted Horace and Pete as a drama. We may be headed
   toward a future where the labels “comedy” and “drama” and “hour” and
   “half-hour” no longer tell us anything useful about a show, and we’ll
   have to think about them, live with them, in order to figure out what
   they are. No joke.

The 10 Best Rom-Com Tributes in The Mindy Project

   By Maggie Fremont

   Photo: Isabella Vosmikova/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images

   The Mindy Project never met a rom-com trope it didn’t like. Mere
   minutes into the pilot episode, Dr. Mindy Lahiri exclaimed, “I’m Sandra
   Bullock!” The majority of its characters have participated in some form
   of dramatic rom-com run. (In the best iteration, Jeremy ran in the rain
   all the way to his best friend, Dr. Jody Kimball-Kenny, before Jody
   leaves for Africa.) The show even gave its parade of love interests
   very rom-com jobs: Seth Meyers was an architect, Allison Williams
   showed up as an oceanographer, and Anders Holm played everyone’s
   favorite pastor-slash-DJ. Sure, there isn’t an actual rom-com about a
   doctor falling for a pastor-slash-DJ, but I would totally pay good
   money for one. (It would be called Heartbeats and the tagline would be
   #Blessed.)

   Beyond playing with rom-com tropes, The Mindy Project also paid homage
   to many of the genre’s modern classics. (Yes, How to Lose a Guy in 10
   Days is considered a classic in this scenario.) Now the series finale
   has aired — and Mindy Lahiri, inventor of Wreath Witherspoon, finally
   got the happy ending she’s always wanted — Vulture is looking back at
   the show’s greatest tributes to her favorite type of movies. As The
   Mindy Project proves, one can be completely in love with something and
   also be able to poke fun at its ridiculousness.

   The Mindy Project Finale: ‘She Gets What She Needs, Not What She Wants’

When Harry Met Sally…

   Easily the most name-checked rom-com on The Mindy Project. This makes
   sense since Mindy and Danny are basically Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) and
   Harry Burns (Billy Crystal), two friends who bicker with each other
   until they realize they are completely in love. It’s Mindy favorite
   movie, a movie which Danny refers to as “When Doofus Met Dummy.” Sick
   burn, Castellano. While I’ll never not laugh at Danny paraphrasing
   “I’ll have what she’s having” into “I’ll order whatever gave her an
   orgasm,” the best tribute to the film comes halfway through the first
   season when Latin professor Jamie (B.J. Novak) arrives to woo our
   heroine in the appropriately titled episodes “Harry & Sally” and “Harry
   & Mindy.” Jamie is seemingly perfect for Mindy, except for one tiny
   problem: He has a best friend named Lucy (Eva Amurri), and they are
   clearly in love each other. The two episodes have lots of references to
   the film — the batting cages, a double date gone horribly wrong — and
   in the end, Mindy realizes that she has somehow become the supporting
   character in Jamie and Lucy’s romantic comedy. She is basically Rob
   Reiner’s mother.

   Here’s the real trick, though: While Mindy feels like she’s being edged
   out of a story about two friends finding one another, she is actually
   beginning that same story with Danny. Over the course of those two
   episodes, Mindy and Danny grow closer and closer as friends. At the end
   of the second episode, when Jamie makes a big speech to Lucy after she
   hits it off with Danny on a double date, we’re not paying attention to
   Jamie and Lucy finally hooking up — we’re watching pals Mindy and Danny
   walk off together and share a heartfelt moment of friendship. We’re
   watching the beginning of Mindy and Danny’s story.

Bridget Jones’s Diary

   The Mindy Project never did a specific homage to the movie adaptation
   of Bridget Jones’s Diary (itself a Pride and Prejudice adaptation), but
   the show screams Bridget Jones from the pilot: the voice-over, Mindy’s
   obsession with her weight, the vivid fantasy life, her weird group of
   cohorts, the fact that she’s smart and somehow good at her job even
   though she is a scorching hot mess. And don’t forget about her choice
   of suitors: In the pilot, Mindy is hooking up with Jeremy, your basic
   Daniel Cleaver–esque English Lothario. On the other hand, there’s Danny
   Castellano. He’s terse, thinks he’s smarter than everyone, and he finds
   Mindy ridiculous until he gets to know her. (Okay, he still finds her
   ridiculous after that, but he is charmed by that ridiculousness.) Put
   the guy in an ugly reindeer sweater and you’ve got yourself Mark Darcy.
   So it comes as no surprise that the book Mindy turns to when she’s not
   feeling well is Bridget Jones’s Diary. In season two’s “Indian BBW,”
   after Danny and Mindy have been dating in secret and both wind up in
   the hospital with viral meningitis, Danny makes a very swoony gesture
   by getting into Mindy’s hospital bed and reading from her favorite
   book. He even does the voices. And that’s how Danny Castellano got the
   nickname Tiny Italian Mark Darcy. Or, at least, he should have.

Pretty Woman

   Season one hit the rom-com tropes pretty hard, typically by taking a
   romantic-comedy premise and letting it blow up in Mindy Lahiri’s face.
   Many rom-com premises would be terrifying if placed into the real
   world, and The Mindy Project is at its best when it exposes those types
   of truths, like its role-reversal take on Pretty Woman. In “Pretty
   Man,” Mindy accidentally sleeps with a prostitute named Adam (Josh
   Meyers) and he is no Julia Roberts. The guy is very into kissing,
   giving him a wardrobe makeover isn’t as fun as Mindy hopes, and he
   writes some offensive original music. (That last one has nothing to do
   with Pretty Woman, but it is a perfectly crafted cringeworthy moment
   and deserves recognition.) This experience with Adam is yet another
   blow to Mindy’s rom-com-loving heart. As much as she may want to be,
   Mindy Lahiri is no Richard Gere.

Sleepless in Seattle

   It’s all about the Empire State Building, you guys. The big romantic
   conclusion of Nora Ephron’s masterpiece about the magic of falling in
   love takes place at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine’s
   Day. After lots of shenanigans, American standards, and cross-country
   plane tickets, Tom Hanks’s sad hot dad Sam Baldwin lays eyes on Meg
   Ryan’s impeccably coiffed Annie Reed for the first time on top of that
   giant building and they just know they are meant for each other. Tom
   Hanks reaches out his hand toward Meg Ryan, asks “Shall we?”, and we
   are all left swooning as they take the elevator down to the ground
   floor. They don’t even kiss and it is still one of the most romantic
   scenes of all time.

   No wonder Mindy Lahiri is obsessed with finding true love at the Empire
   State Building. She is so obsessed, in fact, that she spends time
   hanging out in the lobby waiting to bump into Mr. Right. Of course, she
   ends up getting arrested out of fear that she’s a terrorist (saying
   things like “Boom, fireworks” and “I am a true believer” don’t help her
   situation), but that doesn’t dash Mindy’s hopes of finding love at her
   most sacred of places. She has such a reverence for the Empire State
   Building that when B.J. Novak’s character wants to take her up to the
   top for a romantic Valentine’s Day date in “Harry & Mindy,” she
   refuses, because she knows he’s actually in love with someone else. It
   would be offensive to go up there with him. Of course, that reverence
   also makes it the perfect place for Mindy and Danny to officially get
   together. In this scenario, though, Mindy has to take the stairs all
   the way to the top, so she is a sweaty shell of a human when Danny
   finds her lying on the ground. Even still, their makeout sesh is just
   as swoon-worthy as Tom and Meg’s hand-holding elevator ride.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

   The premise of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is perfect rom-com fodder:
   Andie Anderson (of course that’s her name) is a magazine writer (of
   course that’s her job) who’s writing an article about the things women
   do that make men want to break up with them. And so she chooses Matthew
   McConaughey’s smooth ad dude, Benjamin Barry (!) as her unwitting
   accomplice and they end up falling love. Basically, it’s a movie about
   how Andie sucks at her job but looks great in a yellow dress. Mindy
   takes the How to Lose a Guy premise in season two’s “French Me, You
   Idiot” and uses it to get her boyfriend Cliff (Glenn Howerton) to dump
   her so that she can be with Danny. She tries going to the bathroom with
   the door open, telling Cliff that her psychic told her they’d have
   eight kids but she only wants six, and the classic: “If you break up
   with me, I’ll kill you and all of your friends.” None of these work.
   You know what does? Mindy and Danny almost burning down the church
   during Cliff’s grandmother’s funeral as they secretly make out in the
   back. Kate Hudson never tried that!

Groundhog Day

   Season five’s “Hot Mess Time Machine” homage to Groundhog Day is pretty
   much right on: Mindy wakes up to the same song every morning (Sonny and
   Cher’s “I Got You, Babe” is replaced by Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me
   Maybe”), spends the beginning iterations of her day living the high
   life once she realizes there are no consequences to her actions (for
   Mindy, this means breaking into vending machines and spending $100,000
   on lunch dates with Oscar Isaac), until she realizes, like Phil Connors
   before her, that this time loop is all about love. In other words,
   Mindy needs to win back Nurse Ben (Bryan Greenberg). It is the perfect
   rom-com for The Mindy Project to parody, because, let’s face it, Mindy
   Lahiri is pretty much Phil Connors. Ultimately, she has to overcome her
   selfishness and win over Ben by actually listening to him and
   considering his feelings for once. That X-Men Storm costume doesn’t
   hurt, either.

Say Anything…

   There are so many memorable moments in the John Cusack ’80s classic
   about lovesick Lloyd Dobler: “I gave her my heart and she gave me a
   pen.” Lloyd’s epic speech about not wanting to sell anything, buy
   anything, or process anything as a career. And every Say Anything fan
   thinks about the movie while waiting for the “fasten seat belt” sign to
   turn off during a flight. But, of course, the biggest moment is Lloyd’s
   grand gesture: He shows up outside Diane Court’s window, and holds up a
   boom box blasting “In Your Eyes.” The Mindy Project, a show obsessed
   with grand gestures, does a twist on this scene twice. In season one’s
   “Harry & Sally,” Danny tries to win back oceanographer Jillian (Allison
   Williams) by showing up at her work with a stereo (which he has Morgan
   hold), but he winds up blasting Korn instead of Natalie Imbruglia’s
   “Torn.” This does not work as well as Lloyd’s romantic serenade. But
   even when a Mindy character gets “In Your Eyes” correct, the rest of
   the gesture goes horribly wrong. See Cliff’s attempt to make amends
   with Mindy in season two’s “French Me, You Idiot.” He uses “In Your
   Eyes,” but it’s played by a live mariachi band at 6 a.m. in her
   apartment hallway because, come on, that’s hilarious.

13 Going on 30/Sliding Doors

   We’re combining these two films because that is exactly what happens in
   season four’s premiere “While I Was Sleeping.” (Hey, that’s another
   rom-com!) In 13 Going on 30, teenage Jenna wishes she was a cool
   30-year-old and wakes up as Jennifer Garner with her dream life, only
   she comes to realize her dream life isn’t so dreamy after all. (But she
   does get an entire room of snobby fashionistas to do the Thriller
   dance, and if that isn’t a true accomplishment, I don’t know what is.)
   In Sliding Doors, we watch Gwyneth Paltrow live out two parallel lives,
   one in which she catches a train, dumps her cheating boyfriend, meets
   her soul mate, and after a big kiss in the rain, gets hit by a van and
   dies. In her other life, she misses that train, is stuck with the
   cheating boyfriend, and falls down a flight of stairs, but eventually
   runs into that soul mate at the end. So yeah, not exactly a comedy.

   In the Mindy version, Mindy is upset that Danny will never propose,
   goes to bed wishing she had fallen for someone else, and when she wakes
   up, she’s married to Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Matt, a very handsome Real
   Housewives producer. As it turns out, they got together on that fated
   Danny and Mindy makeout flight, only this time Danny never ran to the
   back of the plane to tell Mindy how he felt. She instead winds up
   meeting Matt, who comes out of the bathroom and mistakes her for a
   small Native American man. Though things seems ideal at first (also,
   Kaling and JGL’s chemistry is off the charts), Mindy realizes Danny is
   the one she loves, and she professes her love to him in the rain, and
   then gets hit by a bus. Mindy wakes up back in the universe we know and
   love. Danny finally proposes, and Mindy is not a 13-year-old who has an
   addiction to Razzles.

You’ve Got Mail

   Season two’s finale, “Danny and Mindy,” has lovely references to
   Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally, but it is overwhelmingly
   and wonderfully a tribute to You’ve Got Mail. Since Danny has screwed
   things up with Mindy, he needs to find a way to win her back. He does
   this by pretending to be a hot dude who had a moment with Mindy on the
   subway — connecting with her over email, of course. Meanwhile, he’s
   also trying his best to be her friend again. You know, not unlike Joe
   Fox (Tom Hanks) trying to win over Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), the
   independent bookstore owner he’s put out of business, who also happens
   to be the woman he met online and fell madly in love with, the Shopgirl
   to his NY152. There are lots of scenes of Mindy and Danny writing to
   one another, he comes over and sits on her bed when she’s sick, they
   walk all over New York City together: all shots that could be taken
   directly out of Ephron’s original film. Danny’s plan doesn’t go as
   smoothly as Joe Fox’s, but let’s be real: No one does it like Tom
   Hanks.

Truth in Comedy After Louis C.K.

   By Jesse David Fox

   Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Comedy Central

   In 2015, while working on the first installment of Vulture’s “100 Jokes
   That Shaped Modern Comedy,” there was a small debate among the team of
   comedians, comedy historians, and comedy journalists assembled to work
   on the project. I say debate, but actually, everyone was pretty much in
   agreement: A Bill Cosby joke should make the list. We reasoned, it is a
   list of jokes first, not a list of the comedians who tell them
   (especially since some jokes on the list were told by multiple people),
   which detached it slightly from each person. But more so, Bill Cosby is
   a cancer in the body of history of American comedy that you can’t
   neatly cut out. He codified a style of long stories, loosely told and
   filled with jokes that inspired a generation of comedians, who in turn
   inspired another generation. Although the ink hasn’t dried on how we
   write about Cosby, his work, and his life, it has on his impact on
   comedy.

   The former is true for Louis C.K., but the latter isn’t. With the New
   York Times bringing to light C.K’s sexual misconduct against female
   comedians, and C.K. admitting the allegations are true, it makes you
   rethink the last 15 years of stand-up comedy, an era that he largely
   defined.

   The Controversial Episode of Louie That Now Plays Like a Confessional

   “Truth in comedy” is an expression out of the improv world, but it
   generally is held as a tenet for stand-up as well. Louis C.K. was the
   contemporary hero of that philosophy. There was even a bit of modern
   comedy legend around it: Not unlike the story of young Richard Pryor
   disappearing after a show in Las Vegas by saying “What the fuck am I
   doing here?” and eventually reemerging as the dirty, political, honest
   comedian who generally is considered the greatest stand-up ever, the
   tale about Louis C.K. went as follows: He was a struggling absurdist
   until he decided to (1) create a new hour-long set every year, and (2)
   make his act more personal. The takeaway from the legend was that Louis
   C.K. gave the audience something more raw than they’ve experienced
   before, pushing the boundaries of “truth in comedy.”

   Was this true? Kind of. Richard Pryor changed the game, talking about
   the roughest parts of his life, whether it was growing up in a
   whorehouse or freebasing cocaine, but it took another couple decades
   before comedians pushed the level of honesty much further. To quickly
   sum it up, the ’90s brought what became known as alternative comedy,
   which was defined by its lack of polish, both in terms of unfiltered
   material and unprofessional settings. It was best defined by two venues
   named Luna (New York’s Luna Lounge and L.A.’s Luna Park) and two shows,
   New York’s Eating It and L.A.’s UnCabaret. The comedians most
   associated with both spaces, but especially Beth Lapides’s UnCabaret,
   were women like Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney, Margaret Cho, and Janeane
   Garofalo. There were definitely men in both scenes, but the difference
   is that the male comics merely liked or preferred those spaces, while
   the female comedians needed it because of how historically unsupportive
   comedy clubs were toward them. In that vein, these scenes also had men
   who deliberately did both alternative rooms and comedy clubs because it
   made them better comedians. Louis C.K. is the most famous example.
   Unlike a Marc Maron, who generally stayed true to the ethos of those
   alternative rooms, C.K. found a way to appropriate the truth-first
   comedy pioneered by female comics for a more aggressive, more masculine
   comedy-club audience. His comedy wasn’t just truthful; it was brutally
   honest. He took the sensitivity of those rooms and used it to tell dick
   jokes. And that was revolutionary.

   Over on the Cut, Anna Silman put together a list of all the times — and
   there were a lot — that Louis C.K. joked about masturbation, including
   arguably one of his most famous jokes. From his 2008 special, Chewed
   Up:

     “I need to cum, I need to — cumming is a need, I came the first time
     when I was 12 and I haven’t skipped a day. I cum every day and I
     fucked maybe 20 times in my life so. It’s just been me doing most of
     the work and I really — you know, I jerk off way too much and it
     upsets me and I don’t know why. Maybe ’cause it’s so selfish, I
     don’t know what it is, but I know it’s bad, I know I’m hurting
     somebody somewhere. There’s something wrong with — I was thinking
     the other day, that you can figure out how bad — how bad a person
     you are by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like, how
     long you waited? And for me it was between the two buildings going
     down.”

These Louis C.K. Jokes Aren't So Funny Anymore

   For this, he was considered the greatest living comedian by many
   critics, comedy fans, and, most importantly, other comedians. So much
   so, comedians like Jerry Seinfeld were criticized for merely performing
   well-written jokes they’d been working on for years. Most young comics
   start out trying to be one of their heroes and for the last 15 years,
   for many, especially men, that meant doing their version of C.K. Go to
   an open mic in any city and you’ll see a few dudes talking about how
   disgusting they are because of this thing about their dick or that
   thing about their dick. C.K. became a standard-bearer for what good
   comedy was and, in turn, what it meant to be honest onstage. Honesty
   itself was fetishized.

   The thing is, C.K. wasn’t being honest onstage when he was selling out
   theaters (and later, arenas). Part of this is structural: C.K. works
   doggedly on material, manipulating his stories to be as funny as
   possible. All comedians do this, especially by the time you can buy
   tickets to see them. What C.K. learned from those alternative spaces,
   the darker your act seems, the more likely the audience think it really
   happened. He achieved this by going inside his psyche, or at least
   appearing to. Where Pryor found comedy in the darkness of his life,
   C.K. revealed the darkness in his head. He would tell us that he tries
   to be a good dad, but he still thinks one of his daughters is an
   asshole, to reference one of his most famous bits. Or take another
   well-known one: “Of course … but maybe,” where he walks the audience
   through all of his bad thoughts and they laugh because they’ve also had
   negative thoughts that aren’t tied to how they live or act as people.
   But Louis C.K. acted on his. That’s the truth he didn’t share with us.
   Considering his prominence in comedy and the prominence of honesty in
   his act, it makes you rethink all supposedly truthful comedy of the
   last 15 years. It makes it harder to hear a comedian say, “This really
   happened,” and believe them.

   C.K.’s act was lauded for being confessional, but here’s the thing
   about confessing: It is a selfish act. You are revealing bad things
   about yourself, in exchange for absolution. As my colleague Matt Zoller
   Seitz wrote, “It’s a power move, rooted in the thrill of subterfuge and
   shock: an artist’s version of indecent exposure.” It’s hard not to see
   parallels between C.K.’s offstage behavior and his act, but it’s not
   just his act. You can also see it in the acts he influenced. I see it
   in my favorite comedians of the last decade, personally, and the
   comedians I’ve celebrated professionally. Pete Holmes is gentler and
   less clubby than C.K., and comes off as extraordinarily nice for a
   comic, but he has a joke about masturbating while having phone sex with
   a partner that I loved at the time I heard it, and I now question my
   own feelings about it as a comedy fan and journalist. I bring this up
   not to implicate Holmes in any way, but to examine how I viewed comedy
   for the last decade, and how we will look back on the comedy C.K.
   influenced.

   With the story about this era of comedy unfinished, I do not want to
   remove C.K. and his influence without offering a replacement — another
   comedian or two who can reframe and reorient how we’ve thought of truth
   in comedy in the 21st century. Five years ago, Tig Notaro was not
   confessing to the audience when she told them she had cancer. She was
   sharing. She was giving her tragedy to the audience, acting as a
   surrogate to life’s darkness and telling us that it’s okay to laugh at
   it. For the last 20 years, Maria Bamford was not confessing her
   struggles so that an audience would tell her that she’s okay. She was
   purposefully trying to destigmatize talking about mental illness in
   polite society. Both Notaro and Bamford use their act and their truth
   to help their audience, to improve society. Both Notaro and Bamford are
   tremendously influential to a younger generation of comedians. Both
   Notaro and Bamford are two of the greatest comedians working today.
   What if we defined this era around them? You can judge for yourself.
   Notaro is performing in L.A. tonight. Bamford is in Portsmouth, New
   Hampshire. Go see them.

Inside the Making of Billie Eilish’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?

   By Craig Jenkins@CraigSJ

   “You can think whatever you want about our music. I love that it’s
   ambiguous.” Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for iHeartMedia

   Finneas O’Connell is having a life-changing week. At just 21 years old,
   O’Connell has enjoyed promising success as an actor, performer, and
   producer in the last five years. You might recognize him as the leader
   of the Los Angeles rock band the Slightlys, or from his role as
   Alistair in the final season of Ryan Murphy’s beloved high-school
   art-kid drama, Glee. He’s now slipped into a less-visible role, but his
   most crucial one yet, as the sole producer of his younger sister Billie
   Eilish’s captivating debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We
   Go?.

   This week, the album O’Connell helped assemble in bedrooms and hotel
   rooms last year debuted on top of album charts in the U.S., as well as
   in multiple countries across the globe. At home, Asleep’s 307,000
   equivalent unit first-week harvest is the second-largest sales week of
   the year, landing just 40,000-some-odd units behind the first-week
   total for Ariana Grande’s meteoric Thank U, Next. Asleep is the first
   No. 1 album by an artist born in the 21st century. At 17, Eilish is the
   youngest Billboard 200 chart topper since Shawn Mendes pulled a similar
   feat at 16 on 2015’s Handwritten.

   The success of Asleep might feel like a UFO landing to listeners still
   new to the sturdy body of work Eilish and O’Connell have pieced
   together since 2016’s wispy, forlorn “Ocean Eyes,” but the brother and
   sister’s journey has been a path of self-discovery and creative
   refinement. Asleep is smarter than your average modern post-genre pop
   album and stranger than our biggest mainstream singer-songwriter works.
   The dance tracks are quiet to the point of claustrophobia, and the pop
   gestures are unusual and almost ironic. “Xanny” tiptoes quietly over
   pilled-out partygoers wondering what makes them tick. “Wish U Were Gay”
   plays a story of a doomed crush like a radio jingle. “When the Party’s
   Over” reimagines a breakup song as a church hymn. When We All Fall
   Asleep, Where Do We Go? is making an impact because it feels new and
   unpredictable, and also because the singer, producer, and players have
   spent the last few years honing their chops to a fine point.

   On Monday, I rang O’Connell up as he relaxed in Highland Park, Los
   Angeles, where he and Eilish were raised, to talk about the making of
   an international hit album. O’Connell is an affable polymath with a
   keen sense of humor and an infectious love of his craft.

   I didn’t get the Invisalign intro at first, but lately, I think of it
   as kind of like the seat-belt warning light before a car ride. Does
   that make sense?
   ﻿Yeah, that makes sense. It became this kind of running joke with me
   and Bill, ‘cause we’d record, and she has been wearing Invisalign for
   like a year-and-a-half now. She’d have it in ‘cause she’d forget,
   ‘cause she’d get so used to wearing it. But it makes your words sound a
   little bit messy when you’re talking with it in. It gives you kind of a
   lisp. So whenever we’d record she’d have to take it out. And I have so
   much audio of her taking out her Invisalign that I was like, “Billie,
   this is gonna be your version of the Lil Wayne lighter flick.” You know
   how when you listen to a new Lil Wayne song he’s lighting up a blunt in
   the song? I was like, “Bill, this is gonna be your signature sound.”

   So we had a sound bite of her taking it out, and we just kind of were
   joking around about it. When we were wrapping it up, I felt like the
   album was pretty dark and covered a lot of heavy stuff, with songs like
   “Bury a Friend” and “Listen” and “Ilomilo.” It was kind of a grim
   reflection of the time that we’re growing up in. The art that I like
   that is the darkest … if there’s an element of humor in it, I think I
   take it even more seriously. It really resonates with me. It was really
   important with this album to find a sense of humor in the midst of all
   of this heaviness. So that was kind of the goal with the intro.

“Bad Guy”

   ?si=v7LR8hvNQvONkXvi4pXjFw

   This song’s got a cool New York synth-punk feel I wouldn’t have guessed
   I’d hear on an album like this. Who do you guys look up to musically
   that people wouldn’t expect?
   ﻿I think the people we look up to that they would expect are the
   Beatles. In my lineage and era of music, Lana Del Rey’s really big to
   us; Coldplay’s really big for me; and bands I grew up on, like Green
   Day and My Chemical Romance. I think the stuff that people probably
   wouldn’t expect is that we started listening to music consciously at a
   really young age. I feel like a lot of the time when you’re growing up,
   you’re listening to whatever’s being played for you. We were very
   quickly discerning about what we wanted to hear and what we wanted to
   listen to. And our dad, especially, was really supportive and helpful
   in sort of building our ears. I like the New York ’80s synth vibe, but
   I’d have to admit that it isn’t a genre I’m particularly familiar or
   well-versed in. I credit the influence of that being strange early
   2000s synth-pop that just had really interesting bounce and groove,
   that was kind of funky in an electronic way.

“Xanny”

   IFRAME:
   https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4QIo4oxwzzafcBWkKjDpXY
   ?si=HyjVBIRJSq61CupF0AUNTg

   I like how the sound tells a story as much as the lyrics do. It feels
   like this song is happening in the middle of a party. I got the sense
   that the instruments on this one were being played a hair out of time,
   to get that woozy, drunk feeling.
   Billie and I were like, “Let’s just make this, the verse especially,
   feel so … jazzy.” I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to sing along to a
   Frank Sinatra record, but you basically can’t. The way he sings …

   He had very specific and intentional timing, yeah.
   Yeah, he just has this crazy lilt to his voice and it throws everything
   into this mellow area that I love. So we tried to go with the emphasis
   of that. And that sort of did help articulate it. Also [most albums
   use] quantizing, which is basically loading in your MIDI and then
   having the computer sort of assign grid lines to all of your playing so
   it corrects it all. I stopped quantizing most of the things I played on
   this album, because …

   That’s what it is!
   I like the human component.

   Absolutely.
   It feels like it has a brain.

“You Should See Me in a Crown”

   IFRAME:
   https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A3XF5xLJHOQQRbWya6hBp7d
   ?si=62ZCu3kiTgCEo2Voo0y8Hg

   Music nerds are always looking for the autobiographical story behind
   the song, but I feel like a lot of the songs that you guys are writing
   are coming from somewhere else. How often does a song come out of
   someone just obsessing over a concept or fixating on an odd turn of
   phrase that you heard somewhere?
   I think a song like “You Should See Me in a Crown” … once I knew that
   that was what I wanted to be the hook, I’m just trying to service that
   hook as well as I can. It has less to do with how to tie in our own
   truth to that hook as it does, “How can we write the best song that has
   ‘You should see me in a crown’ as the hook, and what will we have to do
   to achieve that?”

   So sometimes the story of the song is just, “I hear these words and now
   I have to write a beautiful song around them?”
   Exactly, yeah, “I thought of this title. We have to figure out how to
   justify it.” And then there are songs like “Xanny” that really are very
   autobiographical to Billie and my experience growing up in L.A.

“All the Good Girls Go to Hell”

   IFRAME:
   https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6IRdLKIyS4p7XNiP8r6rsx
   ?si=diT6CDFLQvyZq2c2I51CIA

   I’m hung up on this chorus. It’s a really interesting line, the idea
   that good and evil deities would have this quiet respect for each
   other. It’s not one you hear a lot in Western theology. I wonder how
   your fans are handling the heavier themes in the music.
   ﻿I think Billie has some of the most engaged listeners I’ve ever met or
   heard of. I was doing an interview the other day, and the woman that I
   was being interviewed by was like, “I love all of the fan conspiracies
   about your music. I read somewhere that some fans think that ‘All the
   Good Girls Go to Hell’ is about climate change. I love that they think
   that.” I was like, “That’s ‘cause it is.” You can think whatever you
   want about our music. I love that it’s ambiguous. But that’s not a
   conspiracy theory. That’s just true.

   If there were a God and a Devil, if you believe that there are, the
   idea that humans have made such a mess of the planet at this point that
   they’re both talking to each other like, “What’s going on? Why did they
   do all of this?” That was an appealing concept. “Big hills burn in
   California.” We grew up here, and one thing about California as a state
   is that we don’t really have extreme weather in general. There are
   hurricanes and floods and shit, and we sometimes have earthquakes, but
   a lot of the time, the natural disasters are not in our backyard. In
   the last two years, there have been these horrendous wildfires.

   You could just look out the window and see the skyline on fire. That’s
   gotta have an effect.
   Exactly. I had this feeling of, “Oh, we kinda did this.” Especially
   because, I think, one or both of those fires were man-made, which is so
   scary. I just loved the idea of God and the Devil being essentially
   peers, even if they have different agendas, and looking at human beings
   as this kind of meek group of people and just being like, “What are
   they trying to do here?”

“When the Party’s Over”

   This song is, for what seems to be a breakup song, profoundly
   emotionally mature. It’s looking out for the other person. But what
   catches me is that it sounds like a church cantata. It sounds like the
   liturgical music that you hear in a cathedral. Did you guys grow up
   around that kind of music or grow up in a church background?
   We did, yeah. We didn’t grow up in the church, but we grew up singing
   in a chorus. And the chorus rehearsed at a church, and we sang in
   church services often, and it was a big part of our musical upbringing,
   certainly. Choral music has just always been a huge influence on both
   of our tastes in music.

   It comes through on the record.
   I’m glad to hear that. Conceptually, most of that song came to me on a
   drive home from the house of a girl I was dating. It’s one of those
   cases where I had left her house kind of for no reason. I just sort of
   had said, “Yeah, I gotta go home.” I remember driving home, and there’s
   this freeway in L.A., the 2. I was driving down the 2 back to my house,
   and it’s a very kind of quiet freeway. It just turns around a mountain.
   I remember just having that quiet when I’m coming home, and I’m on my
   own. “I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.” When
   you’re the one putting an end to something, and you’re not actually
   happy about it, you’re not enjoying it, but you feel compelled to for
   some reason. I feel like there’s kind of a safety in not letting
   yourself become fully invested in something.

“8”

   So “8” was originally called “See Through”? I’ve heard a version with
   no pitch-shifting or backing instruments, just the raw vocal and the
   ukulele.
   We get really picky about titles of songs, and I think in that case,
   “8” was a song that we thought we’d be more likely to click on and
   listen to, if we were just observers of our music, than a song called
   “See Through.”

   How often do you take things you’ve recorded and revamp them?
   A lot, a lot, a lot. “All the Good Girls Go to Hell” was a hook that we
   had sitting around for a long time. And then, I was like, “I love this
   hook. We’ve gotta figure this out and write some verses to it and flesh
   it out,” which was really satisfying. We revamp things all the time.
   The way that “8” happened was, we recorded it, and it was just her and
   the ukulele. It was very bare-boned and stripped and really slow. Like,
   so slow. And pretty. I remember saying to her, “We gotta speed this
   up.” There are a lot of ways to speed up a recording in postproduction.
   It never quite sounds as real as it would if you just rerecorded it at
   the right speed. But there are a lot of ways to do it. Instead of
   trying to make it sound real, I set it up the way that, like, if you
   turned a 33 RPM vinyl onto 45 RPM, it just sounds faster. The pitch is
   higher and shit. The whole song’s sped up. I shifted her voice to make
   it sound like it was playing at normal speed during the choruses. But
   the whole song, including the uke and everything, is all sped up 20
   BPM, which is why it has that strange, kind of kooky feeling.

“My Strange Addiction”

   I liked how this one uses guitar strings as a percussion instrument.
   It’s not the only unusual choice on the record, as far as production
   goes. Talk to me about getting weird in the studio.
   The funny thing is, not that this is a point of pride of mine or
   whatever, but we just didn’t record almost any of this album in a
   studio. It’s kind of all done in bedrooms and hotel rooms. The bass
   line and the drums of “Strange Addiction” are so rigid. They’re just
   really percussive, and they just go like … [Hums the synth melody.] I
   just loved that. Once we had that, I was like, “Man, I would love to
   have something that just feels kind of woozy and floaty over top of
   it.” I was like, “I could probably do that with a synth.” But sometimes
   it takes you 15 to 20 minutes with a synth to do what playing one
   guitar chord would do. So Fender had sent me a Jag, which is a type of
   guitar they make. It had a whammy bar, so I played the whammy bar and
   just had the chord kind of droop and go, “Neowowoww.” And I thought
   that sounded really cool. I’m a little bit obsessed with Nile Rodgers’s
   guitar playing, so at the end of the song I played this, like … [Hums a
   funk guitar riff.] Then I shifted it an octave, so it has this crazy,
   impossibly high feeling that I really liked.

   It can take an artist and a songwriter and a producer years to get on
   the same page. It must help to have grown up together. What would you
   guys be doing if not for this though?
   I often joke that I would be a getaway driver.

   Elaborate?
   I just drive really, really fast. And I’ve never been pulled over.

   You have this in common with a lot of musicians.
   I like the idea of being involved in a heist without having to hold a
   gun, ever. That’s pretty cool to me. You’re just like, “Yeah, I just
   drive.” I’d love to justify wearing those douchey leather driving
   gloves. I’d love to have a pair of those but get to wear ‘em and not
   be, like, a huge douchebag. And I think Billie would probably be an
   equestrian. She’d probably work at a stable with horses all the time.
   That’s her other favorite thing in the world.

   I wouldn’t have guessed.
   Yeah, she loves horses. When we go on tour, she’s like, “How can I ride
   horses on this tour? How can I figure that out?”

“Bury a Friend”

   IFRAME:
   https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4SSnFejRGlZikf02HLewEF
   ?si=wTL03hW6QVGmajd3wEdk-A

   I heard this song in a crowded bar Friday night, and I wondered how it
   manages to maintain a sense of intimacy even when it’s played really
   loud. The harmonies are tight and close. The mix is kind of spacious.
   It doesn’t move like pop music. I’m curious about how you arrived at
   that sound. Is it a function of where you recorded it and how you
   pieced it together? Are you thinking, I don’t want anything to sound
   like everything else?
   I have to give credit to her vocal delivery. The beat has got a lot of
   movement in it, but it’s very subdued in its sonics. It’s not very
   bright. It’s very dull. And then her vocal delivery is really
   secretive. I think vocal delivery, more than anything else, articulates
   how a song sounds. Just the quiet, menacing nature of the way that
   she’s talking is the reason that it sounds like that.

“Listen Before I Go”; “I Love You”; “Goodbye”

   The flow of the last three songs is intense. You have this incredibly
   dark song, I think, that’s about disappearing. And then you’ve got the
   love song. Then you’ve got your Wizard of Oz/Dark Side of the Moon
   conclusion, your dramatic Hollywood ending. Are these three songs
   telling one story in installments? Or is that reading too much into
   sequencing?
   Well, Billie loved the linear nature of those song titles, just saying
   “Listen Before I Go, I Love You, Goodbye.” She liked the readability of
   that. I think in broad terms they are [related]. They’re different
   sentiments about a farewell. I love stand-up comedy so much. I really
   love it. But my big complaint about most stand-up comedy is when you
   watch a stand-up special, or you go see stand-up, they’re doing amazing
   jokes, and you’re laughing so hard, and then, suddenly, they’re like,
   “Thanks everybody. Good night.” There’s not really an end, most of the
   time. There are sometimes. Really amazing stand-ups will do that. But,
   often, they just kind of are hilarious for an hour, and then it’s over.
   And I love arc. I love story arcs. I love things that have a
   conclusion. So I really love that this album finishes and it has this
   kind of farewell to it. Even “I Love You” is kind of a farewell in a
   certain way. That was really important to me.
