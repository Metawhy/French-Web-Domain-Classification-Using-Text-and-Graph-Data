   It is with great sadness that parents Chris and Leszek Marcinowicz, and
   brother, Adam confirm the death of Hannah Marcinowicz, her husband
   Jonathan, and their 6 month old baby Saskia, in an air crash on Sunday.
   This is devastating news for everyone involved with Hannah, and we
   would ask for your support and understanding at this difficult time.

   Hannah was passionate about her love of music and the professional
   career she followed as a classical saxophonist and clarinettist. She
   was a rare talent that brought sunshine to everyone she touched, and we
   will miss her and her family terribly.

The London Golden Sax Project

   The London Golden Sax Project is a unique rediscovery of London’s song
   heritage from the Oliver-esque street seller’s cry of ‘Will You Buy’ to
   the timeless classic of ‘A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square’.

   Hannah Marcinowicz and award-winning British stage and screen composer,
   Jonathan Goldstein (BBC, Saatchi & Saatchi, Royal Shakespeare Company),
   collaborate to create evocative musical soundscapes celebrating the old
   and the new, blending the ethereal world of choir and organ with the
   modern world of saxophone and strings.
