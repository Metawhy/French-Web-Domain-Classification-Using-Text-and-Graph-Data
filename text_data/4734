About the Chateaubriand Fellowship Program

   The Chateaubriand Fellowship is a grant offered by the Embassy of
   France in the United States. It supports outstanding Ph.D. students
   from American universities who wish to conduct research in France for a
   period ranging from 4 to 9 months. Chateaubriand fellows are selected
   through a merit-based competition, through a collaborative process
   involving expert evaluators in both countries.

   The program is divided into two subprograms:

   The Chateaubriand Fellowship in Science, Technology, Engineering,
   Mathematics & Biology-Health (STEM) for doctoral students aims to
   initiate or reinforce collaborations, partnerships or joint projects
   between French and American research teams. This fellowship is offered
   by the Office for Science & Technology (OST) of the Embassy of France
   in partnership with American universities and French research
   organizations such as Inserm and Inria. It is a partner of the National
   Science Foundation’s GROW program .

   The Chateaubriand Fellowship in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS)
   targets outstanding Ph.D. students from American universities who seek
   to engage in research in France, in any discipline of the Humanities
   and Social Sciences. This fellowship is offered by the Cultural
   Services of the Embassy of France. HSS Chateaubriand fellows are
   selected through a merit-based competition, using a binational
   collaborative process involving expert evaluators from both countries.
