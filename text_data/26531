   The University of Göttingen is an internationally renowned research
   university. Founded in 1737 in the Age of Enlightenment, the University
   is committed to the values of social responsibility of science,
   democracy, tolerance and justice. It offers a comprehensive range of
   subjects across 13 faculties: in the natural sciences, humanities,
   social sciences and medicine. With over 30,000 students and offering up
   to 212 degree programmes, the University is one of the largest in
   Germany.

Was early stick insect evolution triggered by birds and mammals?

   Stick and leaf insects are a diverse and strikingly bizarre group of
   insects with a world-wide distribution, which are more common in
   tropical and subtropical areas. A team of international researchers led
   by the University of Göttingen has now generated the first phylogenomic
   tree of these insects.

Giant exoplanet around tiny star challenges understanding of how planets form

   An international team of researchers with participation from the
   University of Göttingen has discovered the first large gas giant
   orbiting a small star. The planet was found orbiting the nearby red
   dwarf star GJ 3512. This discovery challenges scientists’ very
   understanding of how planets form: low-mass stars should have less
   available material to form planets. Moreover, this new gas giant is on
   an eccentric orbit, which suggests the presence of another massive
   planet, which may have been ejected from the system in a chaotic
   interaction.

Increased risk of simultaneous droughts in wheat-growing areas

   If global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated, the risk
   of extreme droughts simultaneously affecting central wheat-growing
   areas could increase three to fourfold by the end of the century. This
   is the conclusion of an international study involving the University of
   Göttingen. Even with a significant reduction in CO2 and other
   greenhouse gas emissions, the scientists estimate the risk will double.
   The results were published in the journal Science Advances.

Instant messaging in proteins discovered

   Proteins are essential for every living cell and responsible for many
   fundamental processes. In particular, they are required as
   bio-catalysts in metabolism and for signalling inside the cell and
   between cells. Many diseases come about as a result of failures in this
   communication, and the origins of signalling in proteins have been a
   source of great scientific debate. Now, for the first time, a team of
   researchers at the University of Göttingen has actually observed the
   mobile protons that do this job in each and every living cell, thus
   providing new insights into the mechanisms.

University Senate decides about personnel

   The Senate of the University of Göttingen unanimously agreed that
   Professor Reinhard Jahn should be entrusted with the rights and duties
   of President for a period of approximately one year starting on 1
   December 2019. Jahn's appointment is intended to bridge the period
   until a new president takes up office. The University Foundation
   Committee still has to confirm the vote.

Sustainable support for researchers

   The Welcome Centre for the Göttingen Campus and the Südniedersachsen
   region continues to work hard to strengthen sustainable collaboration
   with its existing project partners. As a result, the University of
   Göttingen, as the sponsor of the Welcome Centre of the Göttingen
   Campus, has now agreed a cooperation agreement with the Max Planck
   Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen.
