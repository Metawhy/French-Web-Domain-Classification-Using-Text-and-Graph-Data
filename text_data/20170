   Abstract: The record layer is the main bridge between TLS applications
   and internal sub-protocols. Its core functionality is an elaborate
   authenticated encryption: streams of messages for each sub-protocol
   (hand- shake, alert, and application data) are fragmented, multiplexed,
   and encrypted with optional padding to hide their lengths. Conversely,
   the sub-protocols may provide fresh keys or signal stream termination
   to the record layer.

   Compared to prior versions, TLS 1.3 discards obsolete schemes in favor
   of a common construction for Authenticated Encryption with Associated
   Data (AEAD), instantiated with algorithms such as AES- GCM and
   ChaCha20-Poly1305. It differs from TLS 1.2 in its use of padding,
   associated data and nonces. It encrypts the content-type used to
   multiplex between sub-protocols. New protocol features such as early
   application data (0-RTT and 0.5-RTT) and late handshake messages
   require additional keys and a more general model of stateful
   encryption.

   We build and verify a reference implementation of the TLS record layer
   and its cryptographic algorithms in F*, a dependently typed language
   where security and functional guarantees can be specified as pre- and
   post-conditions. We reduce the high-level security of the record layer
   to cryptographic assumptions on its ciphers. Each step in the reduction
   is verified by typing an F* module; when the step incurs a security
   loss, this module precisely captures the corresponding game-based
   security assumption.

   We first verify the functional correctness and injectivity properties
   of our implementations of one- time MAC algorithms (Poly1305 and GHASH)
   and provide a generic proof of their security given these properties.
   We show the security of AEAD given any secure one-time MAC and PRF. We
   extend AEAD, first to stream encryption, then to length-hiding,
   multiplexed encryption. Finally, we build a security model of the
   record layer against an adversary that controls the TLS sub-protocols.
   We compute concrete security bounds for the AES-GCM and
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphersuites, and derive recommended limits on sent
   data before re-keying. Combining our functional correctness and
   security results, we obtain the first verified implementations of the
   main TLS 1.3 record ciphers.

   We plug our implementation of the record layer into an existing TLS
   library and confirm that the combination interoperates with Chrome and
   Firefox, and thus that experimentally the new TLS record layer (as
   described in RFCs and cryptographic standards) is provably secure.

   Augmented Secure Channels and the Goal of the TLS 1.3 Record Layer

   Christian Badertscher and Christian Matt and Ueli Maurer and Phillip
   Rogaway and Bjrn Tackmann

   Abstract: Motivated by the wide adoption of authenticated encryption
   and TLS, we suggest a basic channel abstraction, an augmented secure
   channel (ASC), that allows a sender to send a receiver messages
   consisting of two parts, where one is privacy-protected and both are
   authenticity-protected. Working in the tradition of constructive
   cryptography, we formalize this idea and provide a construction of this
   kind of channel using the lower-level tool authenticated-encryption.

   We look at recent proposals on TLS 1.3 and suggest that the criterion
   by which their security can be judged is quite simple: do they
   construct an ASC? Due to this precisely defined goal, we are able to
   give a natural construction that comes with a rigorous security proof
   and directly leads to a proposal on TLS 1.3 that is provably secure.

   The Multi-User Security of Authenticated Encryption: AES-GCM in TLS 1.3

   Mihir Bellare and Bjoern Tackmann

   Abstract: We initiate the study of multi-user (mu) security of
   authenticated encryption (AE) schemes as a way to rigorously formulate,
   and answer, questions about the "randomized nonce" mechanism proposed
   for the use of the AE scheme GCM in TLS 1.3. We (1) Give definitions of
   mu ind (indistinguishability) and mu kr (key recovery) security for AE
   (2) Characterize the intent of nonce randomization as being improved mu
   security as a defense against mass surveillance (3) Cast the method as
   a (new) AE scheme RGCM (4) Analyze and compare the mu security of both
   GCM and RGCM in the model where the underlying block cipher is ideal,
   showing that the mu security of the latter is indeed superior in many
   practical contexts to that of the former, and (5) Propose an
   alternative AE scheme XGCM having the same efficiency as RGCM but
   better mu security and a more simple and modular design.

   A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol Candidates

   Benjamin Dowling and Marc Fischlin and Felix Gnther and Douglas Stebila

   Abstract: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is currently
   developing the next version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   protocol, version 1.3. The transparency of this standardization process
   allows comprehensive cryptographic analysis of the protocols prior to
   adoption, whereas previous TLS versions have been scrutinized in the
   cryptographic literature only after standardization. Here we look at
   two related, yet slightly different candidates which were in discussion
   for TLS 1.3 at the point of writing of the main part of the paper in
   May 2015, called draft-ietf-tls-tls13-05 and
   draft-ietf-tls-tls13-dh-based.

   We give a cryptographic analysis of the primary ephemeral
   Diffie-Hellman-based handshake protocol, which authenticates parties
   and establishes encryption keys, of both TLS 1.3 candidates. We show
   that both candidate handshakes achieve the main goal of providing
   secure authenticated key exchange according to an augmented multi-stage
   version of the Bellare-Rogaway model. Such a multi-stage approach is
   convenient for analyzing the design of the candidates, as they
   establish multiple session keys during the exchange.

   An important step in our analysis is to consider compositional security
   guarantees. We show that, since our multi-stage key exchange security
   notion is composable with arbitrary symmetric-key protocols, the use of
   session keys in the record layer protocol is safe. Moreover, since we
   can view the abbreviated TLS resumption procedure also as a
   symmetric-key protocol, our compositional analysis allows us to
   directly conclude security of the combined handshake with session
   resumption.

   We include a discussion on several design characteristics of the TLS
   1.3 drafts based on the observations in our analysis.

   A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 draft-10 Full and Pre-shared
   Key Handshake Protocol

   Benjamin Dowling and Marc Fischlin and Felix Gnther and Douglas Stebila

   Abstract: We analyze the handshake protocol of TLS 1.3
   draft-ietf-tls-tls13-10 (published October 2015). This continues and
   extends our previous analysis (CCS 2015, Cryptology ePrint Archive
   2015) of former TLS 1.3 drafts (draft-ietf-tls-tls13-05 and
   draft-ietf-tls-tls13-dh-based). Here we show that the full (EC)DHE
   Diffie-Hellman-based handshake of draft-10 is also secure in the
   multi-stage key exchange framework of Fischlin and Gnther which
   captures classical Bellare-Rogaway key secrecy for key exchange
   protocols that derive multiple keys.

   We also note that a recent protocol change---the introduction of a
   NewSessionTicket message for resumption, encrypted under the
   application traffic key---impairs the protocol modularity and hence our
   compositional guarantees that ideally would allow an independent
   analysis of the record protocol. We additionally analyze the pre-shared
   key modes (with and without ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key), and fit them
   into the composability framework, addressing composability with the
   input resumption secret from a previous handshake and of the output
   session keys.
