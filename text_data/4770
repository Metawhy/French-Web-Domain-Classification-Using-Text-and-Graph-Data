   intuitive and fair to everyone. We want SMTs to be the most advanced
   protocol for tokenizing web applications, and it is technical changes
   like these, informed by our unrivaled experience with STEEM, that will
   help us deliver on that promise. Speaking of SMTs, be sure to check out
   our recent blockchain update in which we disclose an ETA for the SMT
   testnet and an update on Platform Independent State Files.

   Voting is at the center of Steem's Proof of Brain algorithm, which we
   believe will be a core value proposition for developers launching SMTs,
   so we want to make sure that when that protocol goes live, the voting
   process is as streamlined as possible.

   When Steem was first released each account had voting power between 0
   and 100%. This system is still present in many interfaces and the
   nomenclature of Steem. During the calculation of rewards an account's
   voting power was multiplied by their Steem Power to get something we
   called a” reward share.” A reward share is an internal system that
   helps the blockchain keep track of author and curation rewards.

   The problem of this approach is that the voting power percent only had
   a precision of two, meaning the smallest amount we could represent was
   0.01%. As users consumed their voting power, the accuracy of these
   calculations became worse and worse and at small levels of voting
   power, the system was almost unusable. Furthermore, this system did not
   interact well with powering up/down STEEM and delegations and made it
   easy to exploit the rules to vote with more Steem Power than you would
   otherwise normally be able to.

Enter Voting Mana

   In Hardfork 20 we changed the internal representation of voting power
   to voting mana which helped to eliminate certain Steem exploits. The
   basic principle is the same. The value still represents the same
   concept of remaining availability to vote on content, but does so in a
   more accurate and consistent manner. Voting mana is the intermediary
   value that was previously calculated by multiplying voting power and
   Steem Power. Voting power regeneration is now more precise, as are the
   consumed values that result in awarding reward shares to content. Along
   with this change, we were able to make the rules regarding Steem Power
   and delegations consistent and eliminate the exploits that previously
   riddled Steem.

Vote Directly with Mana

   Even though we changed the internal structures of Steem to use voting
   mana, the vote operation itself still used a percentage weight. It is
   not nearly as bad for precision as the percentage voting power, but it
   is less than ideal for precision of votes. This is especially true when
   changing your vote. For example, if your max mana is 1,000,000 and you
   vote on a piece of content with 50% weight, you will use 10,000 mana.(A
   100% vote is capped at 1/50th of your remaining mana). If you later go
   and change your vote to 100%, you will use 19,800 mana. If you had
   voted 100% instead originally the vote would have been worth 20,000.
   This subtlety is hidden through the use of the percent weight.

   In the SMT hardfork we are adding a new vote operation that will vote
   directly with voting mana. The same max vote restrictions are enforced,
   but will make the impact of the vote clearer. This operation will be
   used for voting on all SMTs and allows users to vote with each SMT
   separately, each with different amounts of mana. This will allow you to
   upvote content with one SMT while downvoting it with a different SMT.
   Comments can specify up to 5 SMTs that can vote on them, for a total of
   6 assets (5 SMTs plus STEEM).

   There is one more oddity from the previous example. Did you notice it?

   You changed your vote from 50% to 100% and in total used 29,800 mana
   when a 100% upvote first would have only used 20,000 mana! When you
   change a vote you lose out on any curation rewards you would have
   earned. We think this is harsh enough for changing a vote.

   Being charged fully for both votes is unnecessarily punitive, which is
   why were are making the following changes to how votes are charged.

   If the absolute reward shares assigned by the vote increase, you are
   only charged for the delta. You will still be fully charged for
   changing from a downvote to an upvote and vis-versa. Here are a few
   examples to help demonstrate how these rules will impact your voting.

   If you change a vote from 75% to 100%, you consume mana of a 25%
   upvote.

   If you change the 100% vote to 50%, you consume no mana.

   If you change the 50% vote to -50%, you consume mana of a 50% downvote.

   If you change the -50% vote to -100%, you consume mana of a 50%
   downvote.

   If you change the -100% vote to -25%, you consume no mana.

   If you change the -25% back to a 75% upvote, you consume mana of a 75%
   upvote.

   We believe these changes will continue the progress we have already
   made over the last several years to make voting more intuitive and fair
   to everyone.

Blockchain Update: Platform Independent State Files

   steemitblog (73)Steemit Team in steem •  5 days ago  (edited)

   PISFs.jpg

SMT Burnups?

   The blockchain team has spent the time since our last burnup focusing
   on the remaining token emissions work for SMTs and Platform Independent
   State Files. Aside from a little more work on SMT emissions, all of
   that development work is now complete and is awaiting review. For that
   reason, there will be no more SMT Burnups!

Platform Independent State Files

   There are two very good reasons for having Platform Independent State
   Files (PISFs). PISFs can be used to dramatically reduce downtime on
   exchanges while also increasing the level of decentralization in the
   ecosystem.

What are they?

   Up until now, whether using MIRA or boost memory mapped files, the
   databases were “platform specific” in that they were potentially
   impacted by the operating system on which they were running or the
   machine that the database was built with, or both. PISFs are a way to
   migrate that database into a format that is consistent across all
   platforms.

Exchanges

   Without a Platform Independent State File, an exchange (or any other
   node operator) that has to conduct a reindex (e.g in the event of a
   hardfork) might have to wait 24 hours or longer for that reindex to
   complete. During that time their Steem node will not be functional.
   With PISFs we can ensure that no node has to be down for more than a
   few hours!

Decentralization

   Another benefit of PISFs is that it will become far easier for
   community developers to host their own independently verified version
   of state. If just a few people host their own versions of state,
   updated every 10,000 blocks (for example) then it will be easy to
   verify that the state files are identical with identical hashes.

   This is the key to understanding how PISFs increase decentralization
   without decreasing security. The easier it is to independently verify
   that state files are consistent, the more certain we can be that the
   database has not been tampered with with very low computational costs.

Verifiability

   This provides some insight into how we think about blockchains as a
   technology. We do not believe that blockchain’s superpower is “smart
   contracts.” Just because code is executed by a decentralized network of
   machines does not mean you can trust it. Whether it is code or content
   that is stored on a blockchain, what matters is whether that
   information has been independently verified.

   This gets back to a core tenet of the open source software movement:
   eyeballs are what matter. Linus’ Law states that, “given enough
   eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” Extended to the blockchain space we
   could say that, “given enough eyeballs, all inconsistencies are
   shallow.

Soft Consensus

   This is why we think there is so much potential lurking in “Soft
   Consensus.” Soft Consensus is code that is stored on a distributed
   ledger like Steem, but is not executed by the network (“on-chain”).
   This decentralizes the code by enabling anyone to verify that it is
   being executed properly, without the extremely high cost of executing
   that code on-chain.

   Steem’s superpower is that it reduces the cost of Soft Consensus to a
   fraction of what it would be on any other chain. This enables
   applications like Splinterlands to take advantage of Steem’s high
   speed, fee-less transactions, and vibrant community to bootstrap the
   best blockchain-powered trading card game in the world.

Testnet

   With SMT development now done (just awaiting review which could reveal
   minor additional work) the next major announcement from the blockchain
   team will be the release of the testnet which we expect to happen in
   1-2 weeks!
     __________________________________________________________________

@steemitblog Rewards

   As we disclosed in our last post, now that it is so easy to set
   beneficiaries on steemit.com posts, we will be accepting rewards on
   @steemitblog posts, but setting the beneficiary as @null. This will
   enable our posts to Trend in a more organic way that reflects how
   stakeholders feel about our announcements, without enriching us
   financially. This time we thought we'd try something different, so in
   addition to setting @null as a beneficiary, we are also setting the
   SteemDAO as a beneficiary! That means half of the author rewards will
   be burned, and half will go to the DAO to fund proposals.

   Felicidades amigos de @votovzla, los felicito por tan grandioso y
   estupendo éxito con la realización del gran meetup, lo hicieron cuando
   muchos no se hubiesen arriesgado y felicitaciones a todos los amigos de
   steemit que visitaron mi tierra natal para dar su gran aporte con
   charlas interesantes y testimonios de vida en la plataforma steemit.
   Todas las charlas para aprender y seguir creciendo en este mundo
   cripto, felicitaciones a todos los expositores.
   Aunque al final a la zona le tocó el recorte de electricidad el local
   quedó lleno de luz y alegria de todos en especial de la amiga
   @angelica7, quien con su expontaneidad característica se atrevió a
   cantar.
   Un meetup que demuestra que Venezuela está llena de emprendedores y
   luchadores como todos los que participaron en el evento.

   Que hermoso comentario, al leerlo pude sentir gran destello de energía
   me encanta. Debo compartir como lo dije en el Meetup que la blockchain
   de Steem se las trae, es como una ventana de oportunidades y solo se
   debe estar dispuesto a atreverse. Gracias @votovzla por tan maravilloso
   encuentro de almas y gracias a ti @marimex y a tu esposa por tan lindas
   palabras, ustedes dos son preciosos. Buena vibra.

   ¡FELICIDADES Muchachos!

   Wow... Impresionante todo lo que puede hacer un equipo de trabajo,
   donde demuestra que querer es poder, y que en la unión está la fuerza,
   es allí en la verdadera esencia de un buen equipo, donde la
   solidaridad, compañerismo, compromiso, esfuerzo mancomunado y
   disciplina, hace la diferencia.

   Bravos Chicos, lo hicieron excelente, a pesar de todos los
   contratiempos, dificultades y los problemas presentados en tan poquito
   tiempo, donde demuestra que su organización, entrega y planificación es
   un punto fuerte y sólido de emprender su trabajo en el día a día.

   Lastima que todo se me complico para ir, no conseguí efectivo, me
   suspendieron la asignación de harina por Sunagro, me paso de todo un
   poquito, pero todo ocurre por que tiene que ocurrir, a lo mejor no era
   el momento para mí, los tiempos de Dios son perfecto. Vendrán nuevos
   #meetup donde podre participar en mejores condiciones.

   Nuevamente les reitero mis sinceras,calurosas y efusivas
   ¡FELICITACIONES!.

   Saludos cordiales.

   Un fuerte abrazo y besote en la distancia pero no en el olvido.

SMT Burnup Update (July)

   steemitblog (73)Steemit Team in smt •  2 months ago  (edited)

   When SMT.jpg

   Hello Steemians, this post is our answer to the question "When SMT?"
   Also, in case you haven't heard, we just tagged a release for hardfork
   21! If the Witnesses approve that code by a supermajority, the Steem
   blockchain will hardfork on 27th of August, 2019. You can find the
   release notes for that hardfork here.

TL;DR

   Based on our current estimates, we predict the SMT MVP will be complete
   by September 20th. This is not a hard date, but simply an estimate
   which we expect to change over time. The burnup is primarily intended
   for our internal use to better plan the medium to long term roadmap for
   Steemit, but we wanted to share this with you to better communicate the
   current status of SMTs.

Progress

   We resumed work on SMTs over a month ago when the Hardfork 21 release
   candidate was first released and have been splitting time between SMTs
   and Steem 0.21.0. Last fall, when we were previously working on SMTs,
   we were posting weekly progress updates in the form of a burnup chart.
   For those that aren't familiar with a burnup chart, it plots our actual
   progress on top of our ideal progress.

   The ideal progress is a bit of a fuzzy concept, but in AGILE
   methodology it requires our team to size all work needing to be done
   and then estimating how much of that work can be done each week. It
   isn't an exact science, but over the course of the project can be quite
   accurate in tracking and predicting our progress.

   Without further ado, let's take a look at our progress.

   Screen Shot 2019-07-30 at 2.24.21 PM.png

Not Starting From Zero

   This chart looks a bit different from the charts that were posted last
   fall, and there is a reason for that. First of all, we aren't starting
   at 0. Prior to the restructuring last fall, and immediate change of
   priorities, we had completed 129 points out of 340. The second big
   difference is that we are tracking two different SMT completion
   targets. We have also had a small amount of scope increase. These were
   from things that needed to get cleaned up or small stories that we had
   not made issues for. This accounts for an increase of 13 points. Our
   two targets are 279 and 353 points. The first target we are calling the
   SMT MVP and the second target Full SMT.

   Before we restarted development on SMTs we went through all of the
   outstanding work to determine what was really needed to get SMTs
   released. If there was any fat that could be cut without harming the
   usefulness of SMTs, we wanted to cut it or at least delay their release
   so we can get SMTs out sooner. We found 74 points that fit this
   category, which accounts for a little over 20% of the project!

Two Targets, Two Lines

   You can see both targets on the burn up chart. The red line represents
   the MVP target and the yellow line is the full MVP. We predict the
   reduction in scope will allow us to get SMTs out around five weeks
   earlier.

   These are not features that we are permanently cutting, but ones that
   we are not going to complete prior to deploying a public SMT testnet.
   Our plan is to continue development of these features as we test
   publicly. They may or may not be done by the time testing is complete.
   If we can include them without taking a step back in testing or
   significantly delaying the release of SMTs, they will be included in
   the release. Otherwise, we are still committed to developing these
   features, but they will be added in a later hardfork.

   So what made the cut? Or better yet, what didn't?

Technical Debt Issues

   There are a few issues that were included to cleanup code to make the
   maintenance of the SMT code a bit easier. We decided that this is a low
   priority and is not required to release SMTs.

Automated Market Maker

   The Market Maker system is technically involved and not required for
   launching or using SMTs. This was an easy feature set to cut to get
   SMTs out faster.

SMT NAI DNS

   This is a DNS system utilizing Steemit subdomains that would allow
   automated and easy conversion from on-chain Numerical Asset Identifiers
   (NAIs). Last fall we were already planning on developing this during
   the SMT testnet. This system is external to the blockchain. Plans did
   not change at all on this feature.

Current Progress

   As of July 29th, we had 154 points completed but were predicted to have
   171 completed. It would seem that we are already behind schedule.
   However, we have 37 points in review currently which encompass the
   remaining work on the ICO feature set. It is the middle of summer and
   some of our developers have been taking some much needed time off.

   Because of this, work was still being completed, but was not being peer
   reviewed. When the pending work is reviewed and merged we will have 191
   points complete, which would put us 5 points ahead of schedule at the
   end of the week! We won't count those points until they are actually
   complete because the code review process has some back and forth and
   delays do happen. But we do expect to be back on track by the end of
   the week.

Estimated Release

   One crucial feature of a burnup chart is the ability to predict when a
   project will be complete. Based on our current estimates, we predict
   the SMT MVP will be complete by September 20th. This is not a hard
   date, but simply an estimate. If a security vulnerability is reported
   to us and we cannot work on SMTs for a week or the scope of the MVP
   increases, this will cause the date to get pushed back.

   The burnup is primarily intended for our internal use to better plan
   the medium to long term roadmap for Steemit, but we wanted to share
   this with you to better communicate what the current status of SMTs is.

Not a Hardfork Date

   Expect that date to slip, but it is probably going to be in the
   ballpark of when SMTs will actually be done. This is also not a
   hardfork date, but an internal date for when we send SMTs to the
   testnet. We are expecting a testnet cycle longer than the usual 30 days
   due to the size and complexity of the feature set. There are also many
   libraries and applications that need to be updated to be able to
   utilize SMTs. All of this pushes out a potential hardfork date. We will
   determine our recommended hardfork date only when we feel SMTs are
   ready to go live and our community of developers has had to time to
   update their software to utilize the SMT feature set.

   We plan to keep providing these burnup charts in the future, so if you
   find them informative be sure to follow @steemitblog for these and
   other updates!

   Thanks for sharing the plan.

   Fingers crossed you hit the optimistic date - please keep it up in
   letting us know what is happening so we can be along for the journey;
   if possible add some floating descriptions to the points in the graph
   or indicators representing the key elements that can read on a legend
   perhaps.

   As per usual many communities and steeming peps out here having fun and
   willing to help - just ask if you need a hand, even if just a sound
   board or feedback.

   Cheers

   For the non developers reading this, keep in mind that even though
   agile is cool and estimating story points works relatively well, it's
   really easy to under or overestimate a task, which means that the date
   will probably move quite a bit.

   But this is great news, I was not expecting an mvp to be planned so
   soon after hf21 !

   Perhaps we'll have some steemfest SMT testnet tokens :p

   Yes, since the dex is moved to v2, the tokens will not be tradable
   on-chain. But nothing will be stopping other people from offering
   off-chain exchanges for them. That's why we feel confident that we can
   delay this feature, because 3rd parties will likely jump in to fill
   this need.

   Hi there,

   Sounds like SMTs should be good to go within Q4...

   I'm interested in creating a token and was about to get it done today
   via Steem-Engine. However, I would rather not spend the fees involved,
   if SMTs are due to be released soon.

   Are SMTs going to offer similar features such as the Nitrous / Forum
   integration? Are STEEM-Engine tokens going to be around after SMT
   tokens have launched? Is it worth it creating a STEEM-Engine token a
   couple of months prior to the launch of SMTs?

   Thx for any advice.

   Automated market maker aren't included on SMT lite? How are people
   supposed to swap between SMT and STEEM? Build an exchange themselves?
   SMT swapping with order books will have horrible liquidity like most of
   tokens on Steem Engine lol

   Now that you haven't developed it yet, What do you think about making
   the automated market maker resemble Uniswap more instead of Bancor? I
   believe Uniswap model will encourage more STEEM to be locked up
   compared to Bancor and it also will have more liquidity because adding
   liquidity to it is Incentivised. Uniswap contracts are also open
   source.

   SMTs and Communities are being developed in parallel and are
   independent of one another. Communities is non-consensus which means
   that we can begin releasing features as we develop them. That means you
   should start seeing Communities features implemented in some front ends
   well before SMTs are released. With respect to SMTs there are two
   important milestones, when we release the Testnet, and the hardfork
   date. We have much more control over when we release the testnet which
   is basically a way for developer to "play" with SMTs before they are
   released. However, in order for SMTs to be added to the Steem
   blockchain, a hardfork is required and that is a much more complicated
   process which requires that we coordinate with the Witnesses and
   Exchanges to ensure there is a smooth transition between forks.

   Hey there! I'm trying to sign into Dtube with my private posting key,
   and it's saying that it's wrong even though I'm copy/pasting it
   straight from my steem wallet. what's going on? it's not my steem
   account i'm trying to login to, but the actual dtube account.

   Dtube account is tied to Dtube's blockchain. They now has dual login,
   Steem and Dtube. Dtube account is compulsory and Steem is only required
   if you want to automatically post your video to Steem.

   Here's tutorial for claiming your @dtube account with your Steem
   account:

   The first thing to do before SMT is to simplify the registration
   process.
   Can't you simplify how you sign up as above link?
   This is a technology that has already been implemented.

   How will SMT launch influence Steem-Engine ecosystem? This is a general
   question, directed at everyone.

   Don't get your hopes up too much. It would be only 4 months between
   major hardforks... that's unlikely.
   I expect 2-3 months of testing in the SMT testnet before release.

   I'd be happy to see 2-3 months of testnet. This community has been
   waiting for SMTs for a long time. Delivering to testnet stage would be
   really great to see.
