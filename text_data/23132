Evidence-Based, Personalized Nutrition
at Your Fingertips

   DayTwo’s science empowers clinicians and people with diabetes,
   providing a food-as-medicine approach to manage glucose levels and
   improve overall health.

Research + Results

   People process the same foods differently,
   nutrition based on averages does not work well for any one person

   By profiling the gut microbiome and additional clinical parameters,
   we now know what foods are good and bad for each of us

   We’ve shown that an individual’s microbiome in addition to other
   factors, is better for predicting blood glucose response after meals.
   The standard approach of counting carbohydrates and calories does not
   work as well because it considers only the characteristics of food. It
   fails to factor in the unique microbiome and lifestyle of each person.

   As a clinician, I have seen that my patients do not respond to the same
   foods the same way — just like not all weight-loss diets work for all
   people the same.
