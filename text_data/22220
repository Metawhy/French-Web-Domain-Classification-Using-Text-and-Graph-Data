WHAT WE DO

Passionately protecting and restoring critical ecosystems

   The Peace Parks dream is to re-establish, renew and preserve large
   functional ecosystems that transcend man-made boundaries – thereby
   protecting and regenerating natural and cultural heritage vital to
   enabling and sustaining a harmonious future for man and the natural
   world.

Commitment

   We engage with governments to obtain buy-in, secure protected land, and
   channel investment into development of transboundary conservation
   areas.

Conservation at Scale

   We plan and implement innovative strategies that revitalise habitat
   integrity, restore ecological functionality, and protect biodiversity.

Commercial Development

   We develop nature-based tourism and enterprise opportunities to ensure
   the long-term sustainability of protected areas.

Community Engagement

   We capacitate communities in the sustainable use of natural resources
   and unlock opportunities for deriving equitable benefits from
   conservation.

Connected Conservation

   A transfrontier conservation area (TFCA) is defined as the area or
   component of a large ecological region that straddles the boundaries of
   two or more countries, encompassing one or more protected areas as well
   as multiple resource use areas.


   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqGa921g724


   Peace Parks Foundation has been actively involved with the
   establishment and development of ten of the 18 TFCAs found throughout
   southern Africa, all of which are in various stages of development. The
   establishment of each TFCA, or peace park, is complex and far-reaching,
   and involves several phases of activity, which can take many years to
   achieve.  It is an exemplary process of partnerships between
   governments and the private sector – an African success story that will
   ensure peace, prosperity and stability for generations to come.

Lubombo TFCA, Tourism

A bridge to a better life

23 August 2006

   While many residents of the rural area surrounding the Greater St Lucia
   Wetland Park say they have not derived the anticipated benefits
   associated with tourism, the Minister for Environmental Affairs and
   Tourism believes a new bridge in the area could help change this.

   Speaking at the recent opening ceremony for the Ophansi bridge over the
   Mkhuze River, Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the structure not only
   marked a milestone in the development of the Lubombo Tourism Route, but
   opened up a new tourism route within the park.

   The new access road and bridge gave 20 000 people in KwaJobe their
   first all weather access to Hluhluwe, said Van Schalkwyk. Diving at
   Sodwana Bay and game viewing in Mkhuze Game Reserve were now less than
   an hour apart.

   “This new tourism circuit will stimulate economic growth in the Greater
   St Lucia Wetland Park and will open a new world of opportunity for the
   people of KwaJobe,” he said.

   Roland Vorwerk of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park Authority, said
   that the D820 access road on which the bridge was built, linked with
   the Lubombo Road, which connects Hluhluwe with Sodwana and Kosi bays.

   Ten kilometres of this road had already been tarred, with a further 6km
   still to be done.

   Van Schalkwyk said R9.5 million had been ploughed into the bridge’s
   construction, and a further R1.2 million would be spent on a gate and
   community craft market. About 120 local people had been employed on the
   bridge-building project. On-job training had been given in concrete
   works, brickwork, stone pitching, road surfacing and the construction
   of storm water culverts.

   The opening of the bridge follows the launch of the new Lubombo Tourism
   Route at the Tourism Indaba in Durban earlier this year. The route
   traverses southern Mozambique, eastern Swaziland and northern
   KwaZulu-Natal, and combines Maputo, Mozambique’s beaches and the
   mountains of Swaziland with South Africa’s Kruger National Park and the
   Greater St Lucia.

   There have been complaints about the lack of spin-offs for the local
   community, with some suggestions that dune mining might have been
   preferable. However, to date, far more benefits in terms of jobs and
   community empowerment had been delivered than dune mining would have
   done:
     * There had been significant growth in tourism beds in the region,
       including 60% growth in the number of establishments – a direct
       result of the redevelopment of the park and marketing value added
       through its World Heritage status.
     * Agreements had been concluded in respect of six new lodges in the
       park. These confirmed deals equate to well over 300 direct jobs.
       They have been set up as community, private and public partnerships
       and give a significant share to rural people who have been
       neglected.
     * About 26 craft groups, employing 600 people, had been established
       in a park programme to develop and market craft. These groups
       supplied a major retailer – Mr Price.
     * The St Lucia park now included one third of the province’s
       coastline. Sixteen parcels of land that had been fragmented in the
       1990s had been consolidated into a single park; old military bases
       had been removed; and ancient migratory routes for many species of
       animals were being restored.

   A major reason for this economic growth was the way the park had
   improved infrastructure and increased the number and species of game.
   Commercial forests had been removed from the eastern shores and a
   similar process was under way on the western shores.

   Most importantly for tourism growth, a highly successful anti-malaria
   campaign had all but eradicated the disease in the park for the first
   time in many decades, said Van Schalkwyk.

   Andrew Zaioumis, CEO of the Wetland Authority, said while the
   construction of the bridge had brought short-term benefits for people,
   the next step was to ensure that these benefits flowed through to the
   long term.
