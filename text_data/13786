Research & technology

   Real-world data and advanced AI inform the science and delivery of
   brain health

   The Learning Corp has taken a non-traditional approach to product
   development and delivery. With Constant Therapy, we gave patients
   direct access to a developing health and wellness app, and set up the
   process to learn from their experience to refine it. In the five years
   since, the technology we’ve used, and the real-world evidence we’ve
   collected from the 100+ million exercises our users have completed in
   the app, are informing our clinical approach, so that we can increase
   the speed of innovation in and adoption of digital therapeutics.

Clinical research using Constant Therapy

   A number of randomized clinical trials and retrospective studies using
   Constant Therapy demonstrate the benefit of delivering standardized and
   personalized therapy on a digital platform.

A Guide to Right Hemisphere Brain Damage

   The Learning Corp | Aug 6, 2018 | Traumatic brain injury, Stroke

   Leaving food on half their plate… Drawing only half an object… Starting
   writing from the middle of the page… Insisting they waved their left
   hand when they actually didn’t… If you’ve observed any of these
   behaviors, you’ve seen some of the amazing, yet problematic
   neurological symptoms of right hemisphere brain damage caused by stroke
   or traumatic brain injury.

Right Side Brain Damage Provides Only Half The Picture

   Our brains are divided into 2 halves – the right side (or hemisphere)
   and the left side – connected in the middle by the corpus callosum. The
   functions of each are distinctly different so that when one side is
   damaged by stroke or brain injury, only the functions that are
   controlled by that injured side are impacted.

   With right hemisphere brain damage (known as RHBD or RHD), a person may
   have trouble with things like attention, perception, and memory, as
   well as loss of mobility and control on the left side of the body,
   since each hemisphere controls functions on the opposite side of the
   body.

   The other problem making this even more difficult is that often, a
   person with RHBD is not even aware of their problems, and may deny they
   exist at all.

   By increasing awareness of the potential effects of right side brain
   injury, our goal is to help caregivers and families of individuals with
   RHBD recognize, understand, and cope more effectively with the
   challenges their loved ones are facing.

What Is Controlled By The Right Side Of The Brain?

   In general, the right side of our brain is in charge of visual
   awareness, imagination, emotions, spatial abilities, face recognition,
   music awareness, 3D forms, interpreting social cues, and left-hand
   control. It performs some math, but only rough estimations and
   comparisons.

   The brain’s right side also helps comprehend visual imagery and make
   sense of what we see. It plays a role in language, particularly in
   interpreting context and a person’s tone, staying on topic in a
   conversation and organizing thoughts and ideas.

How Does RHBD Impact Daily Life?

   Injury to the right side of the brain may result in cognitive and
   communication problems. Difficulties with memory, attention and
   components of executive function are most common, including planning,
   organizing and self-awareness in the following areas:
     * Attention — Difficulty concentrating on a task or focusing on what
       is said or seen.
     * Visual & Spatial Perception — Processing information in the left
       visual field, resulting in trouble judging location and objects in
       their surroundings. This is called Left Neglect.
     * Reasoning & Problem Solving — Difficulty identifying that there is
       a problem and generating solutions.
     * Memory — Difficulty recalling previously learned information and
       learning new information.
     * Social Communication — Difficulty interpreting abstract language
       such as metaphors, making predictive inferences, understanding
       jokes, and nonverbal cues. Affect, or emotional expressiveness, is
       often flat and reduced. There may be difficulty filtering comments
       during conversations.
     * Organization — Difficulty arranging information and planning,
       reflected in communication difficulties such as telling a story in
       the right order, giving directions, or maintaining a topic during
       conversation.
     * Insight — Difficulty recognizing problems and their impact on daily
       functioning.
     * Orientation — Difficulty recalling the date, time, or place.
     * Musicality — Trouble picking up on certain sounds, which could
       result in miscommunication or inability to appreciate the
       musicality of speech and tone.
     * Speech — Voices can sound monotone or unnatural.
     * Emotional Indifference — Acting as if nothing serious – physical or
       mental – needs to be addressed, when this may not be the case.
     * Loss of Mobility & Control of The Left Side of the Body — Damage to
       the right side of the brain can result in a loss of functionality
       or weakness (called hemiparesis) in the left side of the body.

RHBD Is Complicated By Associated Neurological Self-Awareness Issues

   Perhaps the most difficult challenges facing survivors of stroke or
   brain injury with right side damage is that they are often unaware they
   are missing half of the picture. They may be unaware of things on the
   left side, plus, may deny the need to get help for their condition.

   Right side brain damage may result in the following cognitive
   challenges:
     *  Hemispatial (or Unilateral) Left Neglect — Refers to difficulty
       seeing or processing awareness of anything on the left side,
       including inability to respond to people or objects on the left, or
       being unaware there is a problem on the left. For example, they may
       forget that they are able to move their left arm or leg. Or they
       may fail to eat food from the left side of their plate, or fail to
       comb the hair on the left side of their head. This may have serious
       consequences for safety.
     * Denial Syndrome or Anosognosia — Considered a sub-feature of
       Hemispatial Neglect, it is a complex neurological condition (rather
       than a psychological one) that occurs when specific brain regions
       are damaged by a stroke, rendering a survivor unable to move one
       part of their body, but because a closely related region of the
       brain is still intact, it tells them that their bodies are
       responding normally. The result is that survivors may believe that
       they are carrying out their physical functions in a normal fashion
       despite their actual inability to do so. This can lead to refusal
       to undergo rehabilitation.

How Is Right Hemisphere Brain Damage Treated?

   Like other damage resulting from brain injury or stroke, RHBD is
   treatable. In rehab, Speech-Language Pathologists, Occupational
   Therapists, and Physical Therapists, using evidence-based practice,
   work with survivors in one-on-one therapy to improve skills and limit
   the consequences of right side brain damage.

   Science tells us that the most important element in rehabilitation is
   carefully directed, focused, repetitive practice, so expect this kind
   of therapy to form the basis of most rehab programs. In addition,
   clinicians may treat left-neglect by focusing on conscious awareness
   and using contextual cues that can remove ambiguity.

   The goal of therapy programs is always to help survivors regain lost
   skills and become more independent.

Tips For Caring For Someone With RHBD

   At home, caregivers can take specific steps to help loved ones deal
   with limitations of right hemisphere brain damage, and also help
   improve awareness of their recovering side. And caregivers should take
   steps to avoid caregiver stress in the process. Here’s how:
     * Keep The Environment Safe — Keep all items that have the potential
       to be dangerous (like cleaning chemicals or sharp objects) in a
       secured or out-of-the-way place.
     * Decrease Environmental Clutter & Distractions — Too much visual or
       auditory stimulation in the environment may be confusing.
     * Help Them With Routines & Planning — Try to have a routine every
       day so your loved one knows what to expect. Use calendars, clocks,
       and notepads to remind them of important information. Break down
       directions into small steps and repeat as needed.
     * Use a Caring Approach — Recovering from stroke or brain injury can
       be frustrating for the survivor. Avoid sarcasm or scolding, even if
       your patience is thin. For example, if they haven’t seen the fork
       to their left, gently remind them by saying “look to the
       left,” “here is your fork” or drawing their hand to the fork,
       rather than saying something which may come across as
       condescending, such as “What did you forget?”
     * Be Sensitive To The Survivor’s Visual & Sensory Difficulties — Talk
       to the rehabilitation team about how to best support the survivor’s
       needs. For some individuals, it may be appropriate to place
       critical items the person needs to their right side if they have
       trouble seeing or sensing things on their left side.
     * Help Increase Awareness Of The Left Side — Hold their hand, touch
       their arm, or stand on their left side during a conversation to
       help them become more aware. Placing non-critical items like the TV
       remote or a glass of water on the neglected side may encourage them
       to look and reach for objects on that side. Talk to the
       rehabilitation team about how best to support the survivor’s needs
       so that the neglected side is incorporated into daily tasks, but is
       not too frustrating for the survivor.
     * Encourage Scanning — Have your loved one fully scan (turn their
       head or move eyes from side to side to see) their surroundings to
       adjust for any loss in field of vision. For pen-and-paper tasks,
       using your finger to guide the eye gaze or highlighting the left
       margin of a page can be helpful visual reminders to scan. Place a
       comfortable chair next to the bed on the left (the neglected) side,
       encouraging them to look in your direction as you speak.

   As much as we know today, researchers still feel there is a need for
   significantly more treatment research for cognitive and communication
   disorders associated with RHBD, and are therefore continuously studying
   the effects of right side brain injuries. If you are a survivor or a
   caregiver, be sure to stay up-to-date on research developments in the
   field, so that your recovery can benefit from the very latest
   information.

ICYMI: Can tech help detect a second stroke for recovering survivors?

   Paul Wicks, Ph.D. | Sep 16, 2019 | Stroke

   Read the first in our In Case You Missed It Series, where we review
   previously published scientific research about Constant Therapy and
   brain rehabilitation. ICYMI is written by The Learning Corp scientific
   advisor Paul Wicks, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist and expert in digital
   health, clinical trials, and patient centricity. Paul’s work has been
   profiled by the BBC, NPR, CNN, BBC Radio 4, the Wall Street Journal,and
   the New York Times. He was awarded MIT Technology Review’s TR35
   “Humanitarian of the Year” award, recognized as a TED Fellow, and
   recently joined the inaugural FLIER Program at the Academy of Medical
   Sciences. He sits on the editorial boards of the BMJ, BMC Medicine,
   JMIR, Digital Biomarkers and The Patient.

   In the first few hours, days, and weeks after having a stroke, patients
   receive a lot of medical attention from doctors, nurses, and
   speech-language pathologists. These specialist teams work together to
   treat stroke, prevent worsening, and begin rehabilitation. But what
   happens in the months and years afterwards, when the patient has been
   sent home from hospital? We know that a lot of stroke survivors go on
   to have a second stroke – especially in the first three months after
   their first one, but the risk remains high up to five years later. We
   also know that once patients are back at home it can be hard to keep up
   with rehab exercises and track progress towards recovery. Things are
   even tougher for older patients or people living in isolated rural
   areas, who might struggle to attend rehab sessions and clinic
   appointments in the city.

Tech can help when survivors of stroke are older or live far from clinic
appointments

   In this case, Constant Therapy, delivered via an iPad or smartphone,
   can close the gap. In a scientific peer-reviewed study conducted at the
   Boston University Aphasia Research Laboratory, our co-founder Dr Swathi
   Kiran describes the moving story of (Bob*) a 71 year old retired
   teacher living in the aftermath of a stroke. When he first arrived at
   Dr Kiran’s clinic, Bob had trouble saying words, understanding simple
   yes/no questions, and naming things. Most insurance companies only
   provide for a few weeks of speech and language therapy after a stroke,
   and to make matters worse he lived all the way up in New Hampshire and
   had to travel long distances to get the care he needed. Dr Kiran
   prescribed a series of exercises to be conducted at home using Constant
   Therapy to address the problems caused by his stroke.

   Can Tech Help Detect Another Stroke for Recovering Survivors?

   Exercises that supported Bob to say words started off with basics like
   copying words, matching sounds to letters, and putting things in
   categories. As he got faster and more accurate at these basics, the
   Constant Therapy system started getting progressively harder and adding
   more complex tasks like spelling words, completing sentences, and
   understanding words in everyday tasks like listening to a voicemail
   message. By practicing nearly every day in the comfort of his home and
   a pace personalized to him by the system, Bob was making great
   progress, when tragedy struck again.

A change in therapy performance warranted notice

   Just four months after his initial stroke, Bob’s wife noticed that
   while he seemed fine on the outside, he was struggling with rehab
   exercises that he had been passing with flying colors just days before.
   The change in performance on the Constant Therapy exercises prompted a
   visit to his doctor.  His family doctor noticed some other symptoms and
   an MRI scan revealed he’d had a second stroke. A second stroke can be
   devastating, but because he had already been using rehab exercises most
   days he was able to get back on track quickly. While he suffered
   setbacks, over the course of the next year he continued to make steady
   gains at his new pace and his family and therapists could be kept up to
   date on his progress. After discharge from a second course of
   speech-language therapy, Bob worked on maintaining and improving skills
   at home with Constant Therapy.

   stroke

   As it turns out, there were some early warning signs from his iPad
   exercises in the days leading up to and around the second stroke. While
   he had been making steady progress through identifying words, naming
   pictures, and doing multiplication maths at a moderate level of
   difficulty, around the time of his stroke he suddenly went from 80-100%
   accuracy to 50% and then 0% accuracy in a matter of days. Although we
   can’t know exactly when the stroke took place it did make us wonder –
   could digital platforms act as an early warning system for the onset of
   second, third, and other follow-on strokes in patients who don’t get to
   see their therapists often?

Bob’s story of stroke survival is far from unusual

   We know today there are about 800,000 strokes a year in the United
   States, and about 1 in 4 of those are in people who’ve had a previous
   stroke. Our team is always thinking of ways we could help patients and
   their therapists to not only rehabilitate themselves after stroke but
   also to help provide them with key information to manage their care in
   the months and years afterwards on the road to recovery.

Back to work after stroke: how Patty Geer worked her recovery

   The Learning Corp | Sep 7, 2019 | Stroke, Aphasia

   Patty Geer moved to Florida 30 years ago with dreams of working for
   Disney. But a chance interview at a job fair landed her a position, and
   eventually a career in finance, with the Hyatt Hotels Corporation.

“I realized my stroke recovery was going to have to be my work”

   Work has been a big focus of her life ever since. So when she suffered
   a stroke two years ago, one of Patty’s first thoughts was when she
   could return to her job.

     “I was 51 years old and too young for the rest of my life to be
     over.”  – Patty Geer, survivor of stroke

   “I was in the hospital and thought I’d better catch up on emails. I
   pulled out my phone and couldn’t read a thing. The nurse told me that
   the stroke had affected my vision and ability to read. When they
   brought in flashcards and I couldn’t name simple things like a hammer
   or pencil, I cried. I realized my recovery was going to have to be my
   work.”

Research shows getting back to work after stroke positively impacts brain
health

   Research published in 2018 in the AHA/ASA Stroke Journal shows that
   returning to work can be good for your recovery if you’ve suffered a
   mild to moderate stroke. “Being employed before a stroke and returning
   to work after can be particularly helpful for people in mentally
   stimulating [occupations], such as teacher, lawyer, executive,
   engineer. Working in these kinds of jobs activates several
   interconnected areas in the brain and enhances brain plasticity,” says
   Dr. Hen Hallevi, head of the neurology department at Tel Aviv Sourasky
   Medical Center, and one of the study’s co-authors.

Patty starts stroke rehabilitation with back to work as her goal

   After a week at the hospital, Patty started stroke rehab and was
   introduced to Constant Therapy. Much of her in-clinic and at-home work
   in the app was focused on object recognition. “That is where my friend
   the rhinoceros entered my life. A picture of it kept coming up in the
   app, but I could not remember what it was called. I would get so
   frustrated, and the more I thought about that rhinoceros, the more it
   came up in all the exercises.”
   Patty Geer stroke recovery

   Patty keeps her rhinoceros nearby to remind her of the challenges she
   faced during stroke recovery.

   Patty made it her short term goal to learn to say the word
   “rhinoceros”. Longer term, her goals for recovery were to improve
   reading and be able to drive, in order to go back to work.

   “The assignments that I worked on at home with the Constant Therapy app
   were a critical part of my recovery. They kept my mind working, they
   kept me constantly growing and improving. I took it in steps, and the
   app works that way too, guiding your recovery forward a step at a time.
   Each time I finished an exercise or moved to the next level, it gave me
   the confidence to think I could return to work.”

A remarkable return to work

   And return she did, just three and a half months after her stroke.

   “Ironically, the stroke did not affect my ability to see numbers and
   understand numbers, which given my job was quite a blessing. But my
   reading continued to be a challenge. My colleagues knew I wanted to be
   able to contribute to the success of our team, so they worked with me
   to make sure I wasn’t just sitting in a chair. For example our IT
   Manager, Debbie, set up my computer with software so that it would read
   my emails to me. That really helped.”

Stroke recovery is full of ups and downs

   The joy of returning to work was overshadowed by touch and go moments,
   and a particular low point one day. “I shut my door and thought I can’t
   do this. It’s too hard. Sobbing, I called my mentor Pat, who I had
   worked with for 20 years. I asked her to help me figure out a way to
   exit gracefully. She said to remember I was early in my recovery, to
   keep going, and to call her if I felt the same way in six months. Well,
   I didn’t need to make that call because six months later I was thriving
   again.

   What about the rhino? Today Patty knows what it is, and can call it by
   name. It’s even become her power animal. And while her reading has
   improved, her vision has not, so Patty’s goal to drive is still on
   hold. Her best friend Lisa drives her to and from work every day.

Yes, work can be therapy!

   “There’s never been a day where I haven’t been able to get to work or I
   haven’t been able to get to where I need to go. I am so grateful that I
   have a friend like Lisa to take care of me, and that I have my family
   and all my friends at Hyatt with me. Work is now my therapy.”

       I too had a mini stroke 8 years ago. Its been hell having all my
       physical and mental energies expire out of me but I am in a better
       place after the last 6 years. I’m lucky not to have been injured
       too much but still have to rehabilitate myself to walk, dress, see
       and think more so I keep myself from falling over. I try to loose
       more weight after loosing 55 lbs. The weight became an issue when I
       couldn’t move much and had given up on walking.
       So a note to say things do get better even after a serious fall.
       Thank you, your story on Patti was awe inspiring. If you can use
       this story please feel free. Thank you.
