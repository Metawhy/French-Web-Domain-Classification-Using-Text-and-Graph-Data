   HyMeX in brief
   HyMeX aims at a better understanding, quantification and modelling of
   the hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean, with emphasis on the
   predictability and evolution of extreme weather events, inter-annual to
   decadal variability of the Mediterranean coupled system, and associated
   trends in the context of global change. The multidisciplinary research
   and associated database developed within HyMeX aim to improve the
   observational and modelling systems, better predict extreme events,
   simulate the long-term water-cycle, and provide guidelines for
   adaptation measures.

      EXploiting new Atmospheric Electricity Data for Research and the
                            Environment (EXAEDRE)

   Several studies indicate that the electrical activity should increase
   in warmer climate scenario with less numerous but more severe
   thunderstorms. The expected increase of dangerous electrical
   atmospheric phenomenon then requires defining at present the adaptation
   measures and strategies to anticipate their impacts on human
   activities. However, we are far from understanding all the physical
   processes associated with natural lightning flashes and their links
   with the properties of their parent thunderstorms.
   The EXAEDRE (EXploiting new Atmospheric Electricity Data for Research
   and the Environment) project aims at consolidating the activities,
   which started during the HyMeX (HYdrological cycle in the Mediterranean
   EXperiment) field campaign by the French community on the research and
   operational exploitation of both observations and numerical simulations
   in relation with atmospheric electricity.
   The EXAEDRE activities rely on innovative multi-disciplinary and state
   of the art instrumentation and modelling tools to provide a
   comprehensive description of the electrical activity in thunderstorms.
   The EXAEDRE observational part is based on i) existing lightning data
   collected during HyMeX Special Observation Period (SOP1), and permanent
   lightning observations provided by the research SAETTA and the
   operational Météorage lightning locating systems, ii) new lightning
   observations mapped with a brand new VHF interferometer especially
   developed within the EXAEDRE project, iii) a dedicated field campaign
   over Corsica combining ground-based lightning location detection
   (SAETTA, Météorage, interferometer), a suite of ground-based
   instruments sensitive to lightning component properties and cloud
   electrification, the new airborne electric field mills AMPERA, a suite
   of airborne microphysics probes and the airborne 95 GHz Doppler cloud
   radar RASTA onboard the French Falcon research aircraft, and
   operational weather radar and satellite imagers.
   The modelling part of the EXAEDRE project relies on the electrification
   and lightning schemes developed in the French cloud resolving model
   MésoNH and on the Météo-France operational model AROME for innovative
   investigation of lightning data assimilation Through its rather
   comprehensive observational and modelling approach, the EXAEDRE project
   will improve our knowledge on lightning physics and on the links
   between lightning occurrence, electrification, dynamics and
   microphysics.
   The project will also assess the benefits of the lightning information
   for severe weather nowcasting and for numerical weather prediction
   improvement through lightning data assimilation. Finally the EXAEDRE
   project should also prepare the exploitation of the future optical
   lightning observations of the Meteosat Third Generation program.
   The EXAEDRE consortium consists in Academics and Industries that are
   complementary and experts in their respective fields. The EXAEDRE
   research activities should help promote and expend industrial partner's
   know-how and expertise on instrumentation, data analysis and
   information tools. The EXEADRE outcomes will eventually provide a first
   set of inputs for the development of adaptation measures and strategies
   to ensure the safety of the community in the large sense, but also to
   provide key information to the decision chains and emergency agencies.
   The 36-month project (1st Oct 2016-1st Oct 2019) is funded by the
   French National Research Agency (ANR) (contract ANR-16-CE04-0005). It
   is a contribution to the HyMeX (www.hymex.org) program of the MISTRALS
   metaprogram.
   Partners: LA, CRNM, ONERA, CIELE, Météorage, [IS]2, LaMP, LATMOS,
   SAFIRE.
