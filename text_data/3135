New data reveals 197 land and environmental defenders murdered in 2017

   Rachel Cox Español Tweet Share Environmental Activists DONATE

   Today, in partnership with The Guardian, we publish new data showing
   that 197 people were killed in 2017 for standing up to the governments
   and companies that steal their land and harm the environment, calling
   out the corrupt and unjust practices that enable it.

   These activists are at the frontline of a global battleground. From the
   ruthless scramble for natural wealth in the Amazon, to park rangers
   protecting the nature reserves of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
   faces of environmental defenders span continents, countries and
   regions. Yet, the threats they face are one and the same.

Agribusiness overtakes mining for links to killings

   There are some depressingly familiar trends in the data we are
   releasing today, when compared to figures released in recent years.
   Latin America remains at the top of the scale for global killings of
   land and environment defenders in 2017. However, agribusiness has
   overtaken mining as the industry most linked to the murder of activists
   – together these industries make up over 60% of known links. Meanwhile,
   defending national parks continues to be one of the world’s most
   dangerous jobs, with 21 recorded deaths linked to poaching.

   Emilsen Manyoma from Colombia, was the leader of Comunidades
   Construyendo Paz en los Territorios (Conpaz), an organisation working
   to create spaces free from armed groups in her community, and speaking
   out against right-wing paramilitary groups. Documenting killings and
   forced disappearances, she was an outspoken critic who called out
   companies for forcing people off their land. Alongside her husband, Joe
   Javier Rodallega, she lost her life in a targeted and deadly attack.

Mexico now far more dangerous for environment defenders

   Mexico is now a far more dangerous place for those fighting to protect
   their land, sitting in fourth place (up from fourteenth) in the global
   list of deadliest countries to be an environmental defender.

   At the very start of 2017, Isidro Balenegro Lopez, a Mexican activist
   and Goldman environmental prize winner, was gunned down. He was an
   outspoken critic of illegal logging which threatened the ancient
   forests near his home - a region afflicted by violence, drug
   trafficking and corruption. He is the second award winner to be
   murdered, following the death of the celebrated Honduran activist Berta
   Caceres, who was killed less than 12 months earlier.

     Until companies, investors and governments genuinely include
     communities in decisions around the use of their land and natural
     resources, the people who dare to speak out will continue to face
     violence, imprisonment and loss of life. - Rachel Cox, Global
     Witness Campaigner

   Murder is just one tactic used to silence environmental activists –
   they are often faced with an arsenal of death threats, sexual violence
   and aggressive legal assaults. Wayne Lotter, a leading campaigner
   against the ivory trade in Tanzania had reported numerous deaths
   threats as a result of his animal conservation work. He was shot and
   killed by two armed men in August 2017.

   for defenders in 2017

But killings are levelling off

   Tracking the deaths of environmental defenders in real time means we
   can show that the number of killings have levelled off for the first
   time in four consecutive years. As the international community sits up
   and listens to these hidden stories, there is a momentum for renewed
   pressure on companies and investors to take more responsibility and
   further scrutinize governments who have allowed those who kill to get
   away with it.

   By putting these killings on the map, and campaigning for governments,
   companies and investors to safeguard and consult communities affected
   by projects on their land, we hope that our work helps to end levels of
   impunity that have emboldened the perpetrators of violence and in most
   cases, allowed them to literally get away with murder.

   2017.
