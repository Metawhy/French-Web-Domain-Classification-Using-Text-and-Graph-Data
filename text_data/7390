What is Osteopathy?

   Osteopathy is a drug free holistic treatment, concentrating on the
   health of the entire body. It is concerned with the health of your
   bones, muscles and ligaments (also called musculoskeletal framework)
   and how they function together. Osteopathy in London can detect, treat
   or even prevent health issues through the use of massage, stretching
   and physical manipulation. Read more

   Imagine losing control of your car and waking up at the hospital
   paralysed from the neck down. This is the story of Kristopher Boesen,
   who experienced a life-changing moment where his car spiraled out of
   control on a slippy road surface, slamming into a tree and lamp post.
   Doctors warned Kris’s parents that he might never be able to function
   from the neck down again.

   Pelvic pain can be felt during pregnancy which is a common condition,
   but not only. It can also happen to women without being pregnant or
   having given childbirth. Pelvic pain can originate from a muscular
   dysfunction, such as:
   ✨Vulvodynia
   ✨Dyspareunia
   ✨Vaginismus
   ✨Vestibulodynia
   ✨Pudendal nevralgia
   ✨Interstitial cystitis
   ✨Irritable bowel syndrome
   With gentle stretching techniques working on relaxing the pelvic
   muscles, women’s health physiotherapy can help ease the pain in that
   area and will target the entire relevant muscles group surrounding the
   pelvic floor.
   But our physiotherapists are also there to listen, advise with posture
   and problems in your daily life as well as any couple relationship
   issues if this is affecting your sexual life.
   For more information, visit our webpage and do not hesitate to contact
   our team if you wish to chat with a specialised physio. 💛

   Imagine losing control of your car and waking up at the hospital
   paralysed from the neck down. This is the story of Kristopher Boesen,
   who experienced a life-changing moment where his car spiraled out of
   control on a slippy road surface, slamming into a tree and lamp post.
   Doctors warned Kris’s parents that he might never be able to function
   from the neck down again.

   Welcome, October 🍁 Today marks Older People’s Day.
   There's an underlying myth that falls are an inevitable part of getting
   old. The surprising truth is our risk of a fall decreases with one
   thing - exercise.
   If you or know someone who recently had a fall, lost mobility or
   strength and wish to get back to better physical health and full
   confidence, physiotherapy can help.

   Pelvic pain can be felt during pregnancy which is a common condition,
   but not only. It can also happen to women without being pregnant or
   having given childbirth. Pelvic pain can originate from a muscular
   dysfunction, such as:
   ✨Vulvodynia
   ✨Dyspareunia
   ✨Vaginismus
   ✨Vestibulodynia
   ✨Pudendal nevralgia
   ✨Interstitial cystitis
   ✨Irritable bowel syndrome
   With gentle stretching techniques working on relaxing the pelvic
   muscles, women’s health physiotherapy can help ease the pain in that
   area and will target the entire relevant muscles group surrounding the
   pelvic floor.
   But our physiotherapists are also there to listen, advise with posture
   and problems in your daily life as well as any couple relationship
   issues if this is affecting your sexual life.
   For more information, visit our webpage and do not hesitate to contact
   our team if you wish to chat with a specialised physio. 💛
