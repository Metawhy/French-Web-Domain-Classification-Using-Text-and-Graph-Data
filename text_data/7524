October 2019 Dinner Menu

   affiliate links and this site uses cookies. Click here for details.
   What’s for dinner in my house during October 2019? Menu items include
   skillet shepherd’s pie, cider-glazed chicken, and meatloaf with mashed
   potatoes.

   It’s been a while since I shared a menu on Of The Hearth. I used to
   plan a month’s worth of meals each season (fall, winter, spring, and
   summer) and we’d use each of these menus for three consecutive months
   before moving on to a new menu (you can read details on how I did this
   here and see many of the menus here). I stopped using that … [Read

Dare to Prepare: Flood Preparedness and Safety

   Floods occur more frequently than any other natural disaster in the
   U.S. Here are preparedness and safety tips in case you ever experience
   a flood.

   I recently watched as many families in my area got trapped on roadways
   and/or saw water rush into their homes due to heavy rains from a
   tropical system. Like in other coastal areas, this is a somewhat
   frequent occurrence around here because we live in a flood-prone area.
   Those of us in these areas need to be proactive about preparing … [Read

Stuffed Pepper Skillet

   This dish is nutritious, affordable, and flavorful. As a bonus, this
   Stuffed Pepper Skillet is conveniently prepared in one pan.

   I feel like a significant portion of my life as a wife and mom is spent
   trying to prepare nutritious and affordable meals that my husband and
   kids will actually eat. Preparing meals takes so much effort because my
   husband is a picky eater and my kids’ preferences are somewhat
   mercurial. If this sounds like your household and/or you like … [Read

The Most Wonderful Things About Autumn

   affiliate links and this site uses cookies. Click here for details.
   It’s fall, y’all! Here are 22 things, including cooler temperatures and
   apple cider, that make the fall season fabulous.

   I enjoy watching the seasons change. I love the order the seasons give
   our lives, the biblical truths of which they remind us, and the way
   each transition from one to the next feels like a new beginning. Though
   I’m typically excited when we change seasons, I’m often extra
   enthusiastic when we transition to fall. Maybe this is because I …

Our 2019-2020 Kindergarten Curriculum

   affiliate links and this site uses cookies. Click here for details.
   My oldest child is in kindergarten! We’re using a customized
   Timberdoodle curriculum kit and various supplementary materials as we
   homeschool her.

   Can you believe that my oldest child is in kindergarten? It feels a bit
   surreal because I’m sure it was just yesterday that she was a baby!
   However, I’m now homeschooling a kindergartner and a preschooler while
   my 1-year-old keeps watch. My preschooler is using many of the same
   materials we used when my oldest was in preschool (see an … [Read

   This printable first day of school photo prop is a fun and easy way to
   document back-to-school memories for your family.

   Many parents take photos of their kids when they are headed out the
   door or walking up to their classrooms on the first day of school.
   Recently, some families have begun having their kids hold cute signs
   that provide a little bit of info about themselves. I take lots of
   photos of my kids, but I’ve never kept up with things like baby … [Read

9 Ways Wives Can Avoid Nagging

   affiliate links and this site uses cookies. Click here for details.
   Wives can make suggestions and ask their husbands to complete tasks
   without nagging. Here’s how.

   Nagging, which is repeatedly pestering someone to complete a task or
   act on some advice, isn’t a very pleasant or effective way to
   communicate. Last week I shared some ideas regarding why women, but not
   men, are seen as nags. I'm fascinated by the explanations that experts
   and laypeople have proposed. This week we are going to explore … [Read

Soft and Fluffy Honey Wheat Bread

   September 9, 2019 By Shannon 5 Comments This post may contain affiliate
   links and this site uses cookies. Click here for details.
   This recipe yields healthy whole wheat bread that is soft, light, and
   flavorful. It is easy to prepare, so try some today!

   I recently began making my own bread each week. Though I’ve made bread
   before, I’ve never made enough of it to eliminate the need for us to
   purchase some each time I grocery shop. One reason for this was lack of
   time. With three kids under age five, I don’t exactly have a lot of
   time for baking! The main reason, though, was that I hadn’t found …
