About Us

   Trafalgar Personnel Limited has been successfully meeting the child and
   home care needs of Canadian families since 1979. Founded by Marna
   Martin, the company has expanded over the years and now offers a
   variety of services including full-time Live-In and Live-out nannies,
   au pairs and caregivers on a full-time, part-time, temporary and
   occasional basis providing child, elder and special needs care as well
   as full and part time Housekeepers.

   Our office is located in downtown Oakville in the Miller Mews at 323
   Church St., Unit 13, Oakville, Ontario L6J 1P2. Our door is off the
   inside courtyard, where the pub patio is, at the corner of church and
   Reynolds. Parking is available on the street, in the town parking
   garage on the south west corner and in the outdoor town parking lot on
   the north side of the Miller Mews off Reynolds Street.

   We remain in touch with both employer and employee throughout the
   entire employment period and are happy to answer any questions, or
   assist in any problem solving as necessary. We understand the big
   change overseas applicants go through when coming to Canada. Thus we
   provide a few social functions such as camp weekends: Camp CanAqua in
   Halliburton, Ontario, pub/pizza nights, sightseeing outings, dinners
   etc., to help the caregivers adjust and make friends.  Also, the
   caregiver “welcome package” includes a list of other nannies, au pairs
   and caregivers who have been placed through Trafalgar Personnel and
   live in your area.

   Our employees and families are interviewed and screened in order to
   ensure that a match is compatible. We guarantee that all offers of
   employment are discussed thoroughly with each employer and are reviewed
   to ensure they meet provincial employment standards legislation.

   We expect both employers and their caregivers to treat each other
   fairly and with respect, and to maintain open communication lines so
   that they can work together in finding solutions to any problems that
   may arise. We are here to provide guidance and support, whenever
   needed, throughout the entire placement.
