   Feeling a bit sluggish today? While a slug may not be the cutest animal
   to make a soft toy from, this one was a big hit with my daughter.
   We are very excited to be part of this sew-a-softie series. Every day
   for the rest of the July, there will be one or more softie tutorials
   posted on the sew-a-softie Facebook page and on Instagram.

   We were exploring our local rock pool and discovered these fascinating
   burrowing sea anemones. When you touch the centre of the anemone, it
   quickly closes up! SNAP! We collected some seashells from our adventure
   and went home to make our own burrowing sea anemones.

   making a snake, which turned into a worm.
