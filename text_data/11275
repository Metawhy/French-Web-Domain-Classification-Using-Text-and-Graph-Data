Math Books for the Beginning of the School Year

   September 3, 2019September 2, 2019 Amanda B.

   At the beginning of the school year, I cover simple math concepts like
   number sense and sorting. Having math books to introduce these concepts
   can be a great way for students to engage with new skills. Here are a
   few of my favourite books for the beginning of the year. I like to do
   read-aloudsâ€¦ Continue reading Math Books for the Beginning of the

Alphabet Books for Kindergarten

   August 27, 2019August 21, 2019 Amanda B.

   At the beginning of the school year, I love to have a variety of
   alphabet books available to our kindergarten students. I read these
   books, put them out at tables during centers, and have them around the
   classroom for students to read. I'm going to go through a few of my
   favourites, and hopefully youâ€¦ Continue reading Alphabet Books for

   I found these cute pumpkins while I was out shopping and I had so many
   ideas for them! For this center, I wrote numbers on the bottom of them,
   students would pick a pumpkin, and show the number in different ways. â€¢
   In the first picture, I paired the pumpkins with a magnetic board for
   students to practice writing the number on. The second version of the
   center, has students practicing their one-to-one correspondance and
   counting skills. Both also work on number recognition! â€¢ â€¢ I thought
   these pumpkins could work great at a table center, with small world
   play or in a sensory bin! How would you use them? â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ acorns &

   ðŸ§± New Product! ðŸ§± I am always looking for ways to work on sight words in
   a fun and engaging way. What better way to reinforce sight words than
   Lego? â€¢ I made two different versions of this activity: a reusable
   workmat that you can laminate and use whiteboard markers with, and a
   worksheet that students can colour and write on. Which one would you
   use in your classroom? Let me know in the comments! If there is enough
   interest, I can do a giveaway later this week! â€¢ â€¢ If you would like to
   take a look at these activities, I'll put links in my bio! â€¢ â€¢ â€¢
