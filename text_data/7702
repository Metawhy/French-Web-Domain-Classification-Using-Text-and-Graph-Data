   The middle tier is hazelnut mud cake with frangelico syrup and milk
   chocolate ganache.

   Mum had no say in the design so I went with elegant and pretty, just
   like her.

Nikki and Scott hitched - yay!

   [P1050827c.jpg]
   Nikki and Scott married on Australia Day! Congratulations.
   While I can't say it was against all odds, there were certainly many
   dramas along the way.
   Married at Caloundra where I believe the weather fined up for a few
   hours just for them :)
   I hope in the end it was a magical day and well done on pulling this
   wedding together in 4 weeks. Not many who could do that!
   Wet and wild weather here in Brisbane certainly made caking difficult
   this week.
   The cake is a vanilla bean buttercake with fresh strawberries and white
   chocolate ganache. Pin It
