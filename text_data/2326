     * Wrap Jacket
       I just got this jacket in and I am obsessed with the style. I
       haven't had a jacket like this but it looks really cute over a
       sweater. It will be super versatile this fall.
     * Cream Crew Neck Sweater
       This sweater is currently on sale for $50. I will be wearing it all
       season. Love the cream color but it also comes in four other
       colors.
     * Over the Knee Boot
       These are a great investment piece. A pair of boots that can be
       worn over and over again!

Game Day Party Spread

   September 28, 2019

   It‚Äôs football season! Whether you closely follow, or not you are
   probably around the football talk and probably lose some TV time
   because there is a game on‚Ä¶ all the time! I enjoy game days and the
   excuse to get together with friends to indulge in some tailgating
   foods. Last weekend we had some friends over for the Chief‚Äôs game and
   the weather was perfect to watch it outside on our back patio. The
   adults chatted & watched the game, the kids played in the yard and we
   all enjoyed the food.

Budget-Friendly Fall Fashion

   September 27, 2019

   Dressing for fall might be my favorite of all the seasons. There are
   tons of fun layers to play with, great textures like velvet and
   leather, and of course, tons of booties to style! One of my favorite
   places to look for new boot trends right now is Walmart. Walmart
   Fashion has majorly stepped up its game and come out with such amazing
   options that are very budget-friendly. And the best thing about
   budget-friendly options is you can try new trends without having to
   worry about spending a ton of money.
