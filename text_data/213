How Emotion-Detection Technology Will Change Marketing

   Tom Shapiro

   Written by Tom Shapiro
   @TomShapiro
   Emotion_Based_Tech.jpg

   Imagine someone arrives at your website, Facebook Page, or
   advertisement. Now, imagine that you could change your marketing
   dynamically, right there on the spot, in response to their emotional
   reactions.

   It would be nothing short of a game changer for your business, right?

   Yet this is not fantasy. Exploding with investment and technological
   advances, the world of emotion detection and recognition technology
   will change the face of marketing in the years to come.

   Emotions are what drive your audience to purchase. In fact, studies by
   the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio found that people with damage to the
   part of the brain that triggers emotions -- in other words, people that
   are unable to feel emotions -- find it extremely difficult to make
   decisions.

   The lesson? If your marketing is not evoking an emotional response from
   your target audience, you are making it extremely difficult for your
   prospective customers to purchase from you. That’s right, your own
   marketing is potentially causing prospects to turn away from you and
   your brand.

   What's a marketer to do? Let's dive into some research.

   Click here to download our free introductory ebook on marketing
   psychology.

The Power of Emotions

   Many of the most successful marketing campaigns and initiatives are
   focused on emotions. Take Dove’s “Real Beauty” campaign, which was an
   attempt to change the conversation around women’s beauty. Or Nike’s
   “Just Do It” campaign, firing up the inner-athlete in everyone. Or
   MasterCard’s “Priceless” campaign, which has been powering brand
   success for a whopping 19+ years.

   All of this marketing aims to move your heart, and then relies on the
   experience to build a lasting bond with the brand. What it doesn’t do
   is rely on feature sets, discounts, or new technology to move you to a
   sale. None of it speaks to the number of offices, employees, or years
   in business of the brand. Google Senior VP of Global
   Marketing, Lorraine Twohill, states, “If we don’t make you cry, we
   fail. It’s about emotion.”

   Twohill is not alone with this sentiment. Multiple studies point to
   emotional marketing as more effective than other forms of marketing
   (e.g., product-focused marketing). Based on an analysis of 1,400
   successful ad campaigns, the book Brand Immortality by Hamish Pringle
   and Peter Field reveals that advertising campaigns focused on emotional
   content performed approximately twice as well (31% vs. 16%) as those
   with only rational content.

   The power of emotional content should not come as a surprise. After
   all, emotions drive us to action. As consumers, we first decide on a
   purchase based on emotion, and then try to justify it through the more
   rational parts of our brain. Longer-term, emotions are what cause
   people to prefer brand names, even if generic alternatives are
   available.

   Findings from a 2015 Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience study of 100 ads
   across 25 brands in the consumer goods market revealed that ads with
   the best emotional response generated a 23% lift in sales, meaning that
   emotional marketing is not merely effective as an engagement vehicle
   but also as a true business driver.

   And don’t think that emotion-based marketing is applicable to only B2C
   marketing and individual consumers. Business buyers are also creatures
   of emotion. In fact, successful B2B companies like GE, Cisco, IBM,
   AutoDesk, and Qualcomm all focus on emotions in their marketing.
   Similar to the Pringle and Field findings, the research report “From
   Promotion to Emotion: Connecting B2B Customers to Brands” by CES and
   Google explains that B2B brands achieve roughly twice the impact with a
   target audience when appealing to the personal value to the buyer
   including emotional benefits.

A Mountain of Investment

   In consideration of the power of emotional marketing, it should be no
   surprise that the emotion detection and recognition market is projected
   to be worth $22.65 Billion by 2020, according to the market research
   firm MarketsandMarkets. As a result, investment in the space is
   exploding.

   Apple, one of the most valuable companies on the planet, has been
   keenly interested in emotion recognition for years. In 2014 the company
   filed a patent that described software for analyzing and identifying a
   person’s mood based on a variety of signals, including facial
   expression. Earlier this year, Apple acquired Emotient, an
   emotion-recognition technology company.

   Emotient has a patent for a method of collecting and labeling up to
   100,000 facial images a day, supporting a computer’s ability to
   recognize facial expressions. It’s reasonable to believe that
   Emotient’s emotion recognition technology will start appearing in
   iPhones and iPads before you know it, and then possibly used as a
   platform for more targeted and dynamic engagement when users are in
   their browsers.

   Last year the consumer-research company Nielsen bought Innerscope,
   which uses biometrics such as brain scans and galvanic skin response
   (GSR) to measure subconscious emotional responses to media and
   marketing.

   Affectiva, an emotion recognition technology developer, raised $14
   million just a few months ago. Affectiva boasts the world’s largest
   emotion data repository, with 40 billion data points and close to 4
   million faces analyzed using its technology.

   Overall, those using emotion analysis to test audience reaction to
   their marketing include major marketers such as Unilever, P&G, Mars,
   Honda, Kellogg, and Coca Cola. For example, Kellogg’s used Affectiva’s
   software to determine its ads for Crunchy Nut cereal, with the goal of
   generating high engagement rates with the audience. Viewers were shown
   multiple versions of a commercial featuring animals. A version of the
   ad featuring a snake produced the most laughs, but low engagement rates
   when viewing the ad a second time.

   The facial recognition software revealed that an alternative version of
   the ad featuring an alien produced the desired engagement levels.
   Kellogg’s therefore decided to rollout the alien-based ad instead,
   helping to drive the cereal’s sales.

Nothing Short of a Revolution

   Being able to adjust one’s marketing dynamically, based on the
   real-time reactions of your audience, will empower marketers to provide
   the right message at the right time to the right person.

   In the future, it's likely that you'll be able to calibrate your
   marketing mid-stream with just about any digital experience -- no two
   prospects may experience a brand’s marketing in the same exact way.

   Going beyond advertising, you can already see how Facebook is on a path
   to incorporating emotional reaction into a user’s News Feed by
   introducing "Reactions" this past February. Rather than simply "Liking"
   a post, users can now designate their reaction across six emotions:
   Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry.

   facebook-reactions-669x404.png

   Facebook interprets the use of Reactions as an indication that a
   person’s network on the social platform wants to see more of those
   types of posts. That type of primitive application is sure to evolve
   moving forward. Sammi Krug, Product Manager at Facebook, explains,
   “Over time we hope to learn how the different Reactions should be
   weighted differently by News Feed to do a better job of showing
   everyone the stories they most want to see.”

   As of the time of this writing, Facebook Ads treat Reactions the same
   as Likes. Ad reports do not include a breakdown of individual
   Reactions, although the breakdown can be found in Page Insights. For ad
   delivery, as well, Reactions are treated the same as Likes. Of course
   the next logical step will be for Facebook to treat different emotional
   reactions differently, rewarding Love more than Like, for example, and
   demoting an ad’s visibility if users express anger.

The Future

   It's safe to say that we should expect a great deal of change in the
   world of marketing moving forward. Gabi Zijderveld, CMO at Affectiva,
   provides a peek into the future by explaining the evolution of emotion
   recognition technology:

     Initially, the technology was used to understand how consumers
     engage with their brand content and advertising, and how these
     emotions then influence brand awareness and purchase intent. Now the
     technology is also used to infuse consumer experiences, apps and
     interactive advertising with Emotion AI. This will help to transform
     the face of marketing and advertising by reading human emotions and
     then adapting consumer experiences to these emotions in real time.
     The technology gives marketers the power to truly delight and engage
     their customers with uniquely dynamic and personalized
     interactions.”

   Web development is already on the path towards more personalization. As
   emotion recognition technology becomes more sophisticated and more
   deeply embedded in our array of devices, it will become expected that
   our computers and phones provide us with a continual progression of
   customized triggers and messaging. The technology will be found even in
   future car dashboards, refrigerator doors, and conference room walls --
   essentially any surface will become a possible means for detection of
   emotions.

   Social media will constantly focus on each user’s emotions. For
   example, in the future expect Facebook’s algorithm to focus just as
   much on one’s emotional reactions as it does to one’s historical click
   behavior, providing a unique social environment that goes far beyond
   prediction of the types of posts, pages, and ads one would like. Expect
   Facebook Ads to provide advertisers with the ability to hyper target
   not only based on age, geography, and job titles, but also on the
   individual’s emotional state or progression of emotional states.

   Online marketing will likely evolve into sequential experiences, with
   deeper engagement upon recognition of positive emotional reactions. You
   can also expect more deeply embedded forms of marketing similar to
   product placement. Ultimately, expect emotion recognition to be just
   another core component of marketing, similar to how “digital marketing”
   is now really just “marketing.”

   Emotion recognition technology is clearly bringing about a revolution
   in marketing. Are you ready to start capitalizing on the opportunity?

The Ultimate Social Media Holiday Calendar for 2019 [Template]

   Sophia Bernazzani

   Written by Sophia Bernazzani
   @soph_bern

   Check out our free social media content calendar template.
   Get the Template
   social-media-calendar-holidays-1

   Whether it's International Cat Day, Pizza Day, or Talk Like a Pirate
   Day, it seems like almost every day, the internet is celebrating a
   holiday.

   Whenever I log onto Twitter, I quickly scan what's trending on the
   lefthand side of the screen.

   Download Now: Free Social Media Calendar Template

   Have you ever had this experience -- when you see an obscure holiday or
   observance day trending, and you think to yourself "Yup, I'm
   celebrating that"?

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/ezYHn3gTVeI

   Some of these holidays might be simply too silly for your brand to
   engage with (and we certainly don't suggest sharing content on social
   media and then tacking on a completely irrelevant hashtag for the sake
   of traffic -- that's just plain annoying). But others might not be. You
   could be missing valuable opportunities to take advantage of trending
   topics with fun and relevant "holiday" content on social media.

   From food to politics to animals and everything in between, there is a
   plethora of observance days worldwide during which marketers can share
   content relevant to their industries, get involved in a movement, or
   simply generate more awareness.

   To help you plan for trending holidays, we created a list that you can
   bookmark, as well as a downloadable calendar so you can get automatic
   reminders. The list isn't exhaustive (there are a lot of food-specific
   holidays out there) and these dates and hashtags may still be subject
   to change. But this is a great starting point for social media
   marketers who want to learn more about what's trending and how they can
   plan their content in a way that will be fun and engaging on Twitter
   and other social platforms.

   Want to finish out your 2018 calendar with some upcoming holiday posts?

26 of the Funniest Tweets About Social Media We've Ever Seen

   Sophia Bernazzani

   Written by Sophia Bernazzani
   @soph_bern

   There are a lot of things to be negative about on the internet today.

   And between cyberbullying on Twitter, fake news on Facebook, and too
   many weight loss tea ads on Instagram, it's easy to feel jaded about
   social media in particular.

   In fact, we surveyed more than 3,000 people around the world, and
   one-third responded that they feel "awful" after browsing social media
   -- with Facebook taking the crown for most awful feelings induced.

   So, in an effort to combat these feelings of awfulness, we've compiled
   30 of the funniest tweets about social media we could find. And with a
   healthy mix of snark, mockery, and memes, we think they sum up what
   it's like to be a social media user -- the good, the bad, and the ugly.

26 of the Funniest Tweets About Social Media We've Ever Seen

1) On Optimism

     Instagram: My life is a party.
     Snapchat: My life is a quirky tv show
     Facebook: My life turned out great!
     Twitter: We're all going to die.
     — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) January 8, 2017

2) Just Keep Mowing ...

     how it feels to log off twitter in 2017 pic.twitter.com/PsGAAPI7GN
     — Ziwe (@ziwe) June 5, 2017

3) Take the Good with the Bad

     Twitter: your jokes suck
     Instagram: your face sucks
     Snapchat: your life sucks
     Facebook: your family misses you and is also racist
     — Adrienne Airhart (@craydrienne) October 29, 2015

4) Social Media Gods Don't Give with Both Hands

     it's super annoying to me when people are very good at twitter and
     also really good at instagram come on you can't have both
     — Marissa Emanuele (@HiThisIsMarissa) April 25, 2017

5) You Had One Job

     twitter users: let us edit tweets
     twitter: the stars are now hearts
     twitter users: an edit button please
     twitter: we made everything round
     — Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) June 15, 2017

6) On Twitter Expanding its Character Limit

     This account has been asked to test Twitter's new 280 character
     limit, but as a 100-year-old brand, we believe our fans most enjoy
     traditional tweets with brevity, so we declined. We hope to continue
     to provide a fun, positive place to discuss MoonPies moving forward.
     Thank you.
     — MoonPie (@MoonPie) September 27, 2017

7) Seriously, Though

     I would love to start an interview series with random people from
     Instagram called “How Do You Afford Your Life?”
     — Sam Lansky (@samlansky) September 25, 2017

8) Please, Don't Auto-Play Videos with Sound

     I want an app for each website I visit. And I want all of them to
     have loud videos that play automatically. This is my ideal user
     experience
     — Shuja Haider (@shujaxhaider) August 28, 2017

9) Change Your Passwords, People

     how i'll feel if my DMs ever leak pic.twitter.com/Re6UH60EtV
     — corey kindberg (@coreykindberg) August 28, 2017

10) Personal Branding Is Everything

     This is my Twitter brand. pic.twitter.com/I0D19IJ6EJ
     — liz (@eedollmeyer) August 27, 2017

11) At Least They're Honest

     I'm a:
     ⚪️ man
     ⚪️ woman
     🔘 brand
     Seeking:
     ⚪️ men
     ⚪️ women
     🔘 retweets and attention
     — MoonPie (@MoonPie) August 23, 2017

12) Total Eclipse of the Tweet

     it's a big day for circular foods pic.twitter.com/qMWfLs0dsS
     — [halloween name] (@arb) August 21, 2017

13) It's Important to Keep Things in Perspective

     Facebook: Essential oils.
     Snapchat: I'm a bunny!
     Instagram: I ate a hamburger.
     Twitter: THIS COUNTRY IS BURNING TO THE GROUND.
     — Jeanne Hulme (@jeannes_jargon) July 28, 2017

14) Short, Sweet, and To the Point (1/47)

     The 280-character limit is a terrible idea. The whole beauty of
     Twitter is that it forces you to express your ideas concisely (1/47)
     — James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) September 26, 2017

15) Seriously, Twitter Users Are Salty About This One

     139 characters pic.twitter.com/WkfdXL8oLh
     — Caitlin Kelly (@caitlin__kelly) September 26, 2017

How to Create Shareable Content: 46 Tips From the Experts [Infographic]

   Lindsay Kolowich

   Written by Lindsay Kolowich
   @lkolow

   expert-tips-shareable-content.jpeg

   It's not enough just to write some content, publish it, and cross your
   fingers it does well. Most experts have found it takes a lot of
   thinking, strategizing, and optimizing to create content that your
   audience not only reads, but shares with their networks and links back
   to on their websites.

   SEO Expert Steve Wiideman, for example, recommends starting with
   question-based keywords and prioritizing them by search volume. Erika
   Heald, VP & Head of Content at Highwire PR, finds that putting together
   an editorial calendar at the beginning of each quarter makes it easier
   to vary the types of content she and her team publish. Ryan Hoover,
   Founder of ProductHunt, reminds us that it's all about being authentic
   and adding value to the conversation.

   Venngage asked over 140 different experts to share their top tactics
   for creating addictive, shareable content. Check out the infographic
   below to learn what they had to say.

The 8 Types of Social Media Community Managers (+ Job Descriptions)

   Lindsay Kolowich

   Written by Lindsay Kolowich
   @lkolow
   social-media-community-manager

   In the last decade, the need for social media managers has boomed.
   According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, this trend is not
   slowing down any time soon. The role of a social media manager or
   specialist is categorized within the "Advertising, Promotions, and
   Marketing Manager" sector of the labor force, which is projected to
   grow by 10% before 2026.

   Although more companies are hiring social media community managers, the
   role hasn't evolved much towards goal-oriented, metrics-driven
   marketing. This could be because many companies haven't figured out the
   right way to measure the ROI of their efforts. Because of this,
   they don't know how to hire someone who can help them drive real
   business results.

Download a ready-made job description for the social media manager role here.

   With little focus on bottom-line social media efforts, companies
   relegate the social media role to people with little experience. Once
   hired, those social media specialists aren't ready to lead successful
   goal-oriented efforts.

   While a social media job might center around posting strategies,
   companies should broaden their search and look for experts who are also
   creative or strategic. Here's an example of what a strong job
   description for a social media role might look like:

Social Media Manager Job Description

   A social media manager is responsible for growing audiences on social
   platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Along
   with maintaining a posting schedule, he or she will also regularly
   create platform-specific content including text posts, videos, and
   graphics. They must have a good eye for trends and an understanding of
   social media metrics.

   A strong social media manager should have versatile skills that span
   from copywriting to design, but each type of social role
   usually requires a primary focus or expertise.

   If you're a manager trying to hire your next social media maven, it's
   important to identify how your company needs to grow first. For
   example, if you want to expand your brand on visual platforms, you will
   want to hire a social media expert with knowledge and experience
   related to multimedia production.

   If you're an aspiring social media manager, it's also important to know
   which skills you should hone in on to become in expert in your field.

   To help businesses managers and young social media specialists, we've
   crafted a list of eight social media job roles that could help a
   company grow.

Social Community Manager Jobs

1. Copywriter

   Content is a key component in any marketing strategy, especially when
   social media is involved. Even if you have dedicated bloggers or ebook
   writers, text-based content still needs to be adapted to each social
   network. For example, a strong social media manager might write
   Instagram captions with a relaxed and relatable voice, but might write
   in a more business-oriented voice for LinkedIn

   This role is typically responsible for the creation and adaptation of
   written content for specific social media networks. This person should
   be comfortable writing social posts that are as short as 140 characters
   or blogs over 200 words.

Skills Necessary

     * Copywriting
     * Understanding of Brand Voice
     * Adaptability
     * Positioning
     * Creativity

How This Drives Results

   Writing generic posts for all platforms might make your brand seem out
   of touch, so it's important to have a social media manager who can
   maintain a brand voice while still adapting it to different platforms.
   A great caption or piece of written content that speaks directly to
   your audience could lead to more engagement.

2. Digital or Multimedia Producer

   In 2018, 80% of marketers used visual assets as part of their social
   media strategy, and 63% were regularly using video.

   With the growth of visual platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, and
   the launch of Story and Live Video features on most major social media
   sites, there is now a greater need for social media managers with
   multimedia skills.

   Social media community manager works as a content creator by preparing
   a photo for a social media post

   This type of social media manager might focus on creating images or
   graphics to accompany Facebook posts, taking and curating
   photos or videos for Instagram, producing mobile-optimized stories for
   Snapchat, and creating other content from scratch that helps to grow
   your following.

Skills Needed

     * Experience with Design Software
     * Basic Photography and Videography
     * Adaptability
     * Creativity

How This Drives Results

   Adapting visual content specifically for each social network yields
   more clicks and leads. For example, in an A/B test, we found that
   tweets including both a link and an image optimized for the platform
   yielded 55% more leads than tweets with just a link. Adapting and
   creating content for each specific network is critical to driving
   results.

3. Social Media Metrics Analyst

   As all marketing roles become more and more data-driven, a social media
   community manager needs to be able to dig into the data, analyze that
   data, and draw actionable insights.

   Social media community manager showing his team marketing analytics.
   That includes macro data, such as overall reach and leads generated,
   and micro data like individual experiments around content positioning.
   This person should also be able to set goals that are just out of
   reach -- and find a way to hit them.

   A successful social media community manager enjoys looking at data
   and knows how to use it to make informed decisions. At the same time,
   this person shouldn't be so stuck in the data that it prevents
   experimentation and risk-taking.

   It's important for a social media community manager to constantly test
   new strategies, new content, and new campaigns. This person will be
   skilled at running experiments, such as post frequency tests,
   and refining their social strategy based on the results.

Skills Necessary

     * Data Analysis
     * Curiosity
     * Experience with Running Scientific Experiments
     * Strong Presentation Skills

How This Drives Results

   Constantly testing and analyzing results helps social media community
   managers build more effective standards in their routines. For example,
   that Twitter image test discussed above was designed, implemented, and
   measured by one social media manager. That experiment's results
   have had a serious impact on our social media efforts.

4. News Commentator and Curator

   A successful social media community manager will be able to find new
   opportunities for the company by keeping track of their industry, news,
   and social media trends. They need to know where to look for the news
   and what people are saying about it. They also need to know what's
   changing on social networks and in the industry. When shifts or new
   trends occur, they must be able to react and respond accordingly.

   A social media community manager reviews news and trends regularly.
   They should be skilled at "tactful newsjacking," meaning the ability to
   (tactfully) capitalize on a news story, trend, or hashtag. And if
   something goes awry, they need to be able to mitigate the issue calmly
   and diplomatically.

   Recently, Netflix capitalized on the news that IHOP was changing its
   name to IHOB. The Netflix US Twitter account simply tweeted, "brb
   changing my name to Netflib." See this list for a few other great
   examples.

   The social media community manager can act as an extension of the PR
   team, connecting your team directly with journalists and reporters,
   which can result in increased coverage for the company. For global
   brands, it will also be important for the social media community
   manager to be able to think outside their own region.

Skills Necessary

     * Content Curation
     * Hungry for Information
     * Effective Monitoring
     * Quick Decision-making
     * Good Judgment
     * Can Think Globally

How This Drives Results

   Staying on top of trends as they rise allows your social media
   community manager to newsjack. Posts relating to news or trends can
   boost social media traffic, encourage more engagement from followers
   who might re-share or retweet your content, and could even gain
   attention from journalists looking for story fodder.

5. Customer Service Representative

   When someone runs social media, they are perceived as the voice of the
   company. They'll constantly get questions and comments about their
   company's products, services, and content which might not always be
   positive.

   A social media community manager opens his platform's messenger app to
   answer follower messages. The social media community manager needs to
   be able to communicate with people in different buying stages and mood
   dispositions. They're the "traffic director." They must be able to
   understand where a follower's question or comment is coming from,
   address it appropriately, and provide a course of action or solution.

   To successfully communicate with followers, they should be intimately
   familiar with their company's brand, products, and services.

Skills Necessary

     * Strong Communication
     * Adaptability
     * Calmness
     * Desire to Solve Others' Problems
     * Ability to Troubleshoot
     * Knows @here to Pass Complex Questions,
     * Knowledge of the Company, Products, and Services

How This Drives Results

   Having a link to customer service on social media allows you to respond
   to customer issues on your audience's preferred platform. Responding to
   someone's concerns on social media, rather than over a phone call, can
   also save your company time, money, and other resources.

   Because social media is a public forum, your community manager can use
   these opportunities to showcase your company's quality of customer
   service. For example, if a company is happy with your product or tweets
   about a positive experience, you can retweet or share the post.

6. Community Manager and Facilitator

   Part of building a following on social media is helping that following
   connect with each other and become a community.

   True communities don't simply engage with the company or moderator;
   they engage with each other -- which actually scales the social media
   community much better, too. But community management takes work,
   including asking questions to seed discussions and kicking out people
   who spam or otherwise detract from the community.

   A social media community manager responds to posts in an online
   discussion. A good facilitator asks relevant and thought-provoking
   questions in an engaging way. Another part is setting the tone for the
   community, being present, enforcing community guidelines, and sometimes
   even removing members or deleting posts when appropriate.

Skills Necessary

     * Resourcefulness,
     * Ability to Connect People
     * Can Stimulate Discussion
     * Firm but Empathetic

How This Drives Results

   If your followers like your community, they'll recommend it to
   others -- either on purpose or inadvertently by commenting and having
   it show up on their timeline. This leads to more exposure, which leads
   to more reach.

   To grow a social following, the social media community manager needs to
   help the company's community get value from each other.

7. Funnel Marketing Manager

   Social media is a powerful tool that can help the whole funnel, not
   just the top. It expands the reach of your content, attracts visitors
   to your website, generates leads, and nurtures those prospects
   into becoming customers. That means a social media manager needs to be
   able to pick and share content in a way that will accomplish each of
   those goals.

   A funnel marketing social community manager plans a strategy around the
   company's funnel.

   At the top of the funnel, they need to share social content that
   generates leads. As they get further down the funnel, the social
   media expert needs to engage one-on-one with potential customers who
   are considering a product or service.

   Social media is also particularly effective as a lead nurturing tool
   because prospects use multiple media to consume information. Because
   social channels are more fast-paced than traditional media, like
   email, you can engage with leads in a more timely manner.

   Social media community managers need to have a strong understanding of
   the sales and marketing funnel. Then, they must understand
   which content is appropriate for each level of the funnel.

   To be effective, this manager will need to keep in touch with multiple
   teams in their company. For example, they'll need to pass
   appropriate leads to the sales team or product feedback to customer
   service.

Skills Necessary

     * Funnel Understanding
     * Knowledge of Content for Each Funnel Stage
     * Basic Sales Skills
     * Strong Communication

How This Drives Results

   Sharing conversion-oriented content on social media can attract more
   visitors to your site and convert them into leads for your sales team.
   According to a 2018 GlobalWebIndex Study, 40% of digital consumers use
   social media as a tool when researching products. With the right person
   at the helm of your company's social media accounts, your posts could
   catch the eye of these users.

8. Project Manager and Campaign Coordinator

   Many people across a company may want certain things posted, responded
   to, favorited or "liked." It's up to the social media manager to decide
   which requests to honor and when to honor them. This means they need to
   be highly organized and able to manage multiple requests.

   A project manager meets with colleagues to plan social projects or
   campaigns. They need to be able to quickly assess whether a request
   would resonate with the company's followers, or whether it's too niche
   or too narrow. For example, a location-specific post might be too
   narrow to send to a company's entire Twitter following.

   Social media community managers also need to effectively coordinate
   with different departments to organize campaign launches, while still
   pushing launches and growth initiatives of their own.

Skills Necessary

     * Strong Organization
     * Strong Communication
     * Ability to Negotiate
     * Data-Based Decision-Making

How This Drives Results

   Social media plays a big role in promoting initiatives from different
   departments and teams across a company. When a social media community
   manager effectively balances these promotions with other engaging and
   relevant content, they'll be able to win the hearts and minds of their
   followers and internal stakeholders.

How to Think About Social Media Management

   With this diverse and highly visible role, it's hard to believe that
   the social media community manager position is often still considered
   entry-level.

   These eight jobs should be in the back of any hiring manager's mind as
   they interview potential social media managers. If we can change the
   perception of the role, we'll have a good chance of mastering the
   ability to measure and value social media's ROI.
