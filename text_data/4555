Green Toys Review

   [539354_10151435097058485_1677415718_n.jpg]
   We just celebrated Big Brother's Birthday with an airplane theme this
   year. With his birthday being in July I thought it fitting to do red,
   white and blue colors and theme with the airplanes. So how fitting that
   another wonderful sponsor of his party is Green Toys, with all their
   products made in the USA!
   I love made in the USA products. And not only are Green Toys made in
   the USA but they are all made from 100% recycled plastic milk jugs. So
   cool. They also have these really cool airplanes that fit so perfectly
   with our theme and decor!
   [DSC04591+copy.jpg]
   They have so many products that I can't even begin to list them all.
   However they were so generous to sponsor with the following toys that
   were the hit of the party and around our house!
   [DSC04584+copy.jpg]
   New this year is the Tractor. Bright orange and sturdy. The wagon
   detaches as well. Little Brother even likes to try and ride on this
   one. Out of all the toys we received this was the favorite.
   [DSC04592+copy.jpg]
   [Riding+Tractor.jpg]
   The Ferry Boat. Also new this year and another favorite. Retractable
   ramp and two little cars and really floats on water. Unique and so much
   fun.
   [DSC05019+copy.jpg]
   Race Cars. Fun and sturdy for small hands these cars are virtually
   indestructible.
   [DSC04596+copy.jpg]
   The Seaplane. Perfect for our party theme with real moving propeller.
   Floats on water and is another unique and fun toy.
   [DSC04588+copy.jpg]
   And of course how perfect are the airplanes. Moving propellers, rolling
   wheels and in blue and red Americana colors! LOVE these!
   [DSC04586+copy.jpg]
   Green Toys believes the world would be a much better place if everyone
   said "please" and "thank you", cell phones didn't ring during movies,
   and all toys were fun, safe and made from environmentally friendly
   materials. They are not holding their breath for the first two, so they
   are concentrating on toys! And I'm so glad they are! All the Green Toys
   are super sturdy and built to last. They are also lightweight and easy
   to hold and play for little hands. They can take the rough play from my
   boys who can break toys in a matter of minutes.
   [DSC05015+copy.jpg]
   The race cars were put to good use in the kids favor "suitcases" and
   the other bigger toys became decoration and prizes for fun games at the
   party. Think pin the propeller on the airplane! You should have seen
   the smiles and excitement when they got to pick their prize and take it
   home. What a great feeling to send home some amazing quality toys for
   all the little party goers!
   [Suitcase+Favors.jpg]
   [IMG_0348.jpg]
   [DSC04670+copy.jpg]
   Here the airplanes make the perfect decor to our waffle bar table!
   [Food+Table.jpg]
   Green Toys number one priority is safety. No BPA, phthalates or PVC.
   Just simple fun designs that you can feel good about your children
   playing with and giving as gifts. The packaging they come in is
   completely recyclable and smart as well.
   I can not say enough good things about Green Toys. Fun, affordable and
   inventive toys that continue to be a favorite and hold up like no other
   in our household. You can purchase Green Toys through their website or
   many stores and web sites around the world. Keep up to date with them
   on Facebook for new products, giveaways and more.
   Thank You Green Toys for sponsoring Big Brother's Birthday Bash! We
   LOVE Green Toys!

Going Under Cover with GoodNites

   This is a Sponsored post written by me on behalf of GoodNites for
   SocialSpark. All opinions are 100% mine.
   Hosted by imgur.com
   Shhhhhhhhhh.....We have recently went on an under cover mission. A
   mission battling night time wetness.  For three days and three nights
   we battled it out with our GoodNites! I'm happy to report Little
   Brother came out on top and rocked the TinkerBell design in the
   process.
   No wetting, no leaking and no crunchy crunch diaper noise to give us
   away. All was quiet on the home front.
   We used our GoodNites for exclusively night time, but of course they
   are great leak protection for road trips, overnights with family or
   even trips to the store for extra security. When little ones need to go
   they don't give much notice.
   Both Little Brother and I liked the design and discreet nature of the
   GoodNites underwear. Easily hidden under jammies or pants. They come in
   two sizes. S-M (ages 4-8 roughly) and L-XL (ages 8-14). Although you
   hope your child isn't still needing GoodNites by age 8, bedwetting is
   often a nightly battle for many families for years.
   Make sure you head over to Mission Control (aka GoodNites Facebook
   page) like I did and see what other families are saying about their
   bedwetting experiences and offer/receive honest advice and feedback.
   After all the best advice is from someone who is going through or has
   been through the same experience. I love chatting with other mom's.
   You can also sign up for the undercover mission via either the
   GoodNites website or Facebook page. They are giving away weekly prizes
   and a grand prize trip to California! I'm signed up with my fingers
   crossed! Battle bedwetting and win!

Peaceable Kingdom Paper Airplane Kit Review

   [316908_10151343593961166_832792751_n.png]
   Big Brother just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago and I was so lucky to
   get to work with Peaceable Kingdom as a sponsor of his birthday party.
   "Come into the kingdom and join the fun!" from their motto to their
   site design and mission, everything about Peaceable Kingdom is happy
   and fun! A perfect pairing for a party!
   [DSC05008+copy.jpg]
   I paired up with Peaceable Kingdom as they offer some really fun
   affordable gift ideas for children. And fun products that educate,
   stimulate and inspire. I specifically spotted their Paper Airplanes
   Kit. As Big Brother's Birthday theme was airplanes this year I just
   knew these would be perfect favor ideas for the kids!
   [DSC04598+copy.jpg]
   [DSC04600+copy.jpg]
   The Paper Airplane Kits are just $4.99 and it comes with everything you
   need to make three brightly colored paper airplanes. With direction on
   how to fold them and 85 stickers to create your one of a kind design.
   They were super easy to assemble and the boys really put a lot of
   thought into their creations. The best part, the airplanes really fly!
   Fast and far! Such a fun, happy and creative toy! Something to get
   imagination flowing!
   [DSC04991+copy.jpg] [DSC04993+copy.jpg]
   [DSC04996+copy.jpg] [DSC05023+copy.jpg]
   I'll have a post coming on the party soon, but here are the little
   suitcases I made for each attending child with their airplane souvenirs
   to take home! I thought they turned out so good and brought smiles and
   excitement to the kids as well.
   [DSC04616.jpg]
   [IMG_0348.jpg]
   Peaceable Kingdom is such a fun company. The products they offer range
   from Birthday Cards, Books, Games, Stickers and more. And not just a
   couple items, but a huge variety of choices! Here are a few of my
   favorites.
   [STK133_SPREAD.jpg]
   [gm100.gif]
   [GM106_HootOwlHoot_SPREAD_R.jpg]
   They also have online games and crafts that you can print out. They
   know the vital importance of happy relationships with our kiddos and
   all of their products help to connect us with them.
   And one of my very most favorite things that Peaceable Kingdom has to
   offer is their Birthday Club. For US residents 10 and under they not
   only will send a special card but a little something extra too! What
   kid doesn't LOVE to receive mail? Big Brother was so so excited and
   happy when his card arrived. It came with a package of scratch and
   sniff stickers. He was elated. The little things that brighten a
   child's day, what a special company indeed.
   [DSC04384.jpg]
   Peaceable Kingdom has been around since 1983 and started with a single
   product. They are now a industry leader in stickers, greeting cards and
   cooperative games. Their mission is to: Make good, do good, be good!
   You can find out more about what they do to follow this mission on
   their web site. I think Peaceable Kingdom will be around for awhile.
   [DSC05034+copy.jpg]
   Find out what you've been missing, products and more by following on
   Facebook! And don't forget that Birthday Club! Tell them I sent you and
   say hello! They are sure to bring a smile to you and your family!
   Thank You Peaceable Kingdom for sponsoring Big Brother's 5th Birthday
   Airplane Party!

Owl Always Love You Personalized Book Review by Flattenme

   [flattenme.jpg]
   I am so excited to share this amazing personalized book from Flattenme
   with you. My boys love books and reading so it was a no brainer when
   Flattenme contacted me to review the Owl Always Love You book. I was
   however so surprised with how much we could love a book once it
   arrived.
   [DSC04729+copy.jpg]
   First and for most this is a personalized book. It has Little Brother's
   name on the cover and every page. That in itself is so special and
   brings bright eyes and smiles every time we read the book. Second this
   book is perfectly bound and the artwork is so beautiful. You have to
   really take in each page as you read. The rhyming is so clever and so
   cute the boys will quietly sit and listen and then ask to read it all
   over again when we're done. A perfect bedtime book!
   [DSC04730+copy.jpg]
   [DSC04733+copy.jpg]
   There are certain books that I put up on the shelf and only bring down
   when we can read together so they don't get ripped and ruined by the
   boys. This book has made it to the safety shelf where it can be
   displayed and read together as a family for years to come. My hope is
   that this will also be a great memento that Little Brother can always
   have with him to know how much we all love him.
   [DSC04732+copy.jpg] [DSC04752+copy.jpg]
   Owl Always Love You is just one of the many fun gift idea's that
   Flattenme has to offer. From books to T-Shirts, wall art, water bottles
   and cards, all of their gifts are meant to spark your child's
   imagination with either their name or their photo. What a perfect gift
   idea for any occasion!

   ideas, giveaways and more!

   _______________________________________________________________
   Back to school is such an exciting time for most families. I remember
   looking forward to school clothes shopping with my Mom, Sister's and
   Aunt every year. We would make a mini getaway out of it and spend some
   girl time together.
   Shoes were always high on the list of must have's so that is what you
   have the chance to win in this giveaway! And not just any shoes but the
   best all natural high quality shoes from Twig!
   [Twig-Giveaway2.jpg]
   Twig is a small family run business and stands for, Quality, Style and
   Comfort. They believe in taking care of their customers. If you call
   them, you will speak directly to the owners. And if you email them, you
   will receive a personalized email from a Twig family member. Something
   that is rare these days.
   [logo.jpg]
   And what is more important is the quality of shoes you will be putting
   on your kids. Twig believes in good foot health over fashion. They know
   that poor footwear as children will lead to poor foot health as an
   adult. Their shoes are made from only the best natural materials and
   are hand made in Mexico. They are not a big assembly line process like
   mass produced brands and therefor take great care in each and every
   pair of shoes that is made.
   Twig offers:
   - Shoes made from the best natural materials.
   - Durability to stand up and look good after several months.
   - Trend right, fashionable footwear.
   - Product with strong emotional appeal.
   - Twig Footwear is a family-owned small business with BIG dreams!
   - Selling to other small businesses. Not for the mass market.
   We had a chance to review the "Walter" style last year and they have
   been one of the best shoes we have owned. Big Brother has been wearing
   those shoes a ton and they still look as good as the day we got them. I
   love that if I'm going to spend money on good quality items that they
   can also be handed down to Little Brother as well. (You can read more
   about Twig and see detailed photos of these shoes here)
   [DSC08389+copy.jpg]
   Twig Footwear has in my opinion some of the best kids shoes on the
   market. They are cute and fashionable and age appropriate. Your child
   will not only have on the cutest and most stylish shoes but I bet their
   feet will be the most comfortable as well.
   Twig firmly believes in supporting local Mom & Pop stores and keeping
   small businesses alive. I also share this belief and I'm proud to be
   sharing Twig with you today. Please enter to win these fantastic shoes
   and tell your friends. Support Twig and see what real service and
   quality is all about. You can visit them on Facebook as well and have
   real conversation with the owners too!
   Now enter below then hop on over to the other participating blogs for
   more back to school goodies!

Jillie Pays It Forward - Fundraiser

   JILLIE UPDATE:
   Jillie is feeling healthy and ready to pay it forward!
   For those of you who are new here and don't know about Jillie, let me
   give you a brief introduction. Jillie is the daughter of close friends
   of mine and was diagnosed with Acute Myloid Leukemia last year at the
   age of 2.5. My blog and followers rallied around her with giveaways,
   messages, love and support and her story has a happy ending as she is
   now in remission and cancer free!
   While in the hospital where she spent nearly every day for 4 months her
   family noticed the lack of good healthy food and an over abundance of
   junk food easily handed out to the children with cancer.
   Jillie and her family are now trying to pay it forward. Raising money
   to bring change and healthy food options to the hospital where Jillie
   was staying. They believe healthy food in can create such a difference
   in the healing of these children.
   Please visit Jillie's site to read more about her story and the need to
   pay it forward. Please donate if you can or share her story to make a
   difference. If everyone donated even just $1 the impact could be so
   great! Thank You!
