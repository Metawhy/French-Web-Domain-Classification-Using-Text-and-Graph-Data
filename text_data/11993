       time I've been using it, so it's time to correct that! I have used

       didn't despise. MM is FAR superior to anything else out there.
       Thank you! ” — Noah

       have been desperate for, for ages. I have a library of 35,000 MP3's
       and have been unable to find any player that can cope with anything
       close to that number in a sensible, intuitive and most importantly,
       speedy fashion (MusicMatch is a total joke in comparison).

       awe and admiration since I downloaded it yesterday.” — Tim

       life.”
