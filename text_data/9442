   the products and services. It is your responsibility to consult with a
   legal advisor to ensure compliance with applicable laws

   agents or affiliates, accessing or using the Portal will not do

   5. REMEDIES. BITDEFENDER and Partner expressly agree and understand
   that the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this

   flowing from any such breach may not be readily susceptible to being
   measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, BITDEFENDER and Partner
   acknowledge that upon adequate proof of a violation by the Partner of
   any of the provisions of this Agreement, Bitdefender shall be entitled
   to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction against
   any threatened or future breach hereof. Any such breach shall toll the
   running of the time period from the date of such breach, until such
   breach shall cease. The Partner expressly acknowledges that Partner has
   carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions and the
   rights and remedies of Bitdefender under this Agreement. The Partner

   and are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of
   Bitdefender.


   6. SEVERABLE PROVISIONS. The provisions of this Agreement are
   severable, and if any one or more provisions is determined to be
   illegal or otherwise unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining
   provisions, and any partially enforceable provision, shall be binding
   and enforceable to the extent enforceable in any jurisdiction.


   7. BINDING EFFECT. The rights of Bitdefender under this Agreement shall
   inure to the benefit of Bitdefender and its successors and assigns. The
   Partner’s obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon
   Partner and Partner’s successors, assigns, agents, heirs, personal
   representatives, and estate.


   8. WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. The failure of Bitdefender to enforce
   any provision or provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be
   construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any
   future violations thereof, nor prevent Bitdefender thereafter from
   enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights
   granted herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall
   not constitute a waiver of the right of Bitdefender to assert all other
   legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. The Partner
   acknowledges that Bitdefender has other remedies at law and that
   Bitdefender is entitled to assert all of those remedies concurrent with
   those granted under this Agreement.


       9. GOVERNING LAW AND CONSTRUCTION. The present contract is governed
   by the Romania Laws. In case any of the clauses of the present contract
   will be declared void, the other clauses will not be affected and will
   continue to be valid and applicable within the limits of the Florida
   Laws. The venue is at the competent courts from Bucharest. The
   prevailing party in any bad debts dispute shall be entitled to recover
   costs and expenses associated with resolving such dispute, including
   reasonable attorney fees.

   10. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Both Parties to this Agreement expressly
   acknowledge that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create a
   partnership or other association between the Parties hereto except as
   otherwise expressly agreed in writing. Both Parties to this Agreement
   also expressly acknowledge the authority of the individual(s) signing
   this Agreement to execute same on its behalf. This agreement does not
   limit the rights of the parties to negotiate a relationship and sign an
   agreement with another party in case of failure of negotiations between
