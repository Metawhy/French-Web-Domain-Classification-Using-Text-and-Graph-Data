Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 7 (The End)

   Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 7

   Weâ€™ve finally made it to the end of the weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“
   for this final installment weâ€™ll be looking at Switches, Teleports and
   Pop-Up Spikes â€“ altogether thatâ€™s a total of 20 weapons and tools! For
   a refresher on the other 17, take a look at these links:

   Part 1 â€“ Inventory, Bombs, Boulders, Spikes
   Part 2 â€“ Redesigned Inventory, One Shot Bumpers, Multi Use Bumpers
   Part 3 â€“ Fans, Cannons, Slime
   Part 4 â€“ Harpoons, Cake, Stun Bombs
   Part 5 â€“ Deathlogs, Lava Pits, Mines
   Part 6 â€“ Proton Beams, Mirrors, Conveyor Belts

   Switch

                                   switch

   Switches activate or deactivate whatever tool they are attached to and
   are when a Splatt walks over it. Some Switches can only be triggered
   once and will then break, other switches can be triggered multiple
   times to activate and deactivate whichever tool it is attached to.

                                   switch

   Switches can be used to trigger a variety of tools including Boulders,
   Harpoons, Fans, Pop-Up Spikes and Proton Beams. In addition to this
   Switches can be used to trigger Moving Platforms to start or stop
   moving. You can use Sci-Eye mode to see which Switch is connected to
   which tool â€“ a feature that is very useful for puzzle levels that
   contain multiple Switches.

   Teleport

                                  Teleport

   Teleports come in pairs and can be used to warp weapons and Splatts
   from one Teleport Unit to the paired Teleport Unit. A Teleport can be
   entered and exited from either side and each side is colour coded to
   make life easier â€“ anything that goes into the Blue side of one
   Teleport will exit from the Blue side of the other. Similarly anything
   that goes into the Orange side will come out of the Orange side of the
   paired Teleport.

                                  Teleport

   This rule also applied to any projectiles shot through a Teleport,
   making it possible to fire a Cannonball or Harpoon Bolt through a
   Teleport for a surprise attack that the Splatts will never see coming.

   Pop-Up Spikes

                                Pop-Up Spikes

   Pop-Up Spikes are sharp and pointy, just like ordinary Spikes, however
   the similarities stop there. Pop-Up Spikes will always be connected to
   a Switch and are stored inside a metal container, making them
   completely harmless to all Splatts until they are activated.

                                Pop-Up Spikes

   If the Pop-Up Spikes have not been activated by the Switch, Splatts can
   walk over the metal container unhindered. Once activated, the Pop-Up
   Spikes will â€˜pop upâ€™ without warning whenever a Splatt walks over the
   container. The Splatt will be thrown up into the air with the force of
   the Spikes popping up, which will prove deadly for Rapid and Alpha
   Splatts. The Tank Splatt is capable of taking a hit from the Pop-Up
   Spikes without dying, so you will need to combine other deadly weapons
   into your traps to take out this solidly built Splatt.

   We hope youâ€™ve enjoyed reading about all the tools and weapons and are
   looking forward to being let loose in our labs when we launch 101 Ways
   To Die on Steam, Xbox One and Playstation 4 later this year!

Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 6

   Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 6

   Not many weapons left to go now. This time around weâ€™ll be looking at
   Proton Beams, Mirrors and Conveyer Belts.
   If you missed any of our previous weapon blogs or need a refresher you
   can find the previous installments at the links below:

   Part 1 â€“ Inventory, Bombs, Boulders, Spikes
   Part 2 â€“ Redesigned Inventory, One Shot Bumpers, Multi Use Bumpers
   Part 3 â€“ Fans, Cannons, Slime
   Part 4 â€“ Harpoons, Cake, Stun Bombs
   Part 5 â€“ Deathlogs, Lava Pits, Mines

   Proton Beams

                                Proton Beams

   Previously known as a Laser, the Proton Beam is a highly charged stream
   of energy that causes Splatts to catch fire if they stand directly in
   the beam for too long. Proton Beams travel in straight lines and are
   blocked by walls, tools and other Splatts.

                                Proton Beams

   Proton Beams can be used in combination with Mirrors to redirect the
   beam around corners and to get the best angle for maximum Splatt
   incineration. Once on fire, Splatts can stay alive for a short amount
   of time, if the Splatt does not maintain contact with the Proton Beam
   the fire will go out on its own after a few seconds, meaning that the
   longer a Splatt stays in contact with the Proton Beam, the more damage
   will be inflicted.

   Mirrors

                                   Mirrors

   Mirrors reflect Proton Beams and can placed on floors, walls and
   ceilings. The angle of the Mirror can be changed to set which direction
   the Proton Beams will be reflected at.

                                   Mirrors

   Multiple Mirrors can be used in combination to redirect the Proton Beam
   multiple times, giving it the potential to cover a large area and
   ensuring that Splatts stay in contact with the Proton Beam for as long
   as possible.

   Conveyor Belts

                                  Conveyors

   Conveyor Belts can be used to slow down or speed up the movement of
   Splatts, depending on which direction the belt is rotating. Conveyors
   can also be used to transport some weapons like Bombs and Boulders in
   the desired direction.

                                  Conveyors

   Although the Conveyors donâ€™t directly cause any damage to the Splatts,
   they can be instrumental in bringing about their demise. For instance
   slowing a Splatt down while in contact with a Proton Beam can keep the
   Splatt in the beam for just that little bit longer, allowing for enough
   extra damage to be inflicted for the Splatt to die.

   As always (and if you havenâ€™t already) if you want to see more
   screenshots and GIFs of these weapons in action please check out our
   social media pages which are regularly updated with cool new stuff.

Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 5

   Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 5

   Weâ€™re on to part 5 already! Read on for all you need to know about
   Deathlogs, Mines and Lava Pits.

   If you need a refresher on the Weapons and tools weâ€™ve covered
   previously you can check out these links:

   Part 1 â€“ Inventory, Bombs, Boulders, Spikes
   Part 2 â€“ Inventory Redesign, One Shot Bumpers, Multi Use Bumpers
   Part 3 â€“ Fans, Cannons, Slime
   Part 4 â€“ Harpoons, Cake, Stun Bombs

   Deathlog

                                  Deathlog

   This medieval, spike-laden log hangs from a chain in the ceiling and
   will swing back and forth to clobber anything stupid enough to blunder
   into it. Although The Deathlog is most effective when placed at a
   Splattâ€™s head height, we donâ€™t want to make things too easy (this is a
   puzzle game after all). Instead youâ€™ll often find Deathlogs pre-placed
   in a level swinging at a height too high for a Splatt to just walk into
   it. Instead youâ€™ll need to make use of other tools such as Bumpers or
   Mines to impale the Splatts on these swinging death-traps.

                                  Deathlog

   Once a Splatt is impaled on a Deathlog it will be game over for them,
   so if youâ€™re trying to make any elaborate combo deaths make sure the
   Deathlog is at the end of the chain ðŸ˜‰

   Mine

                                    Mine

   Mines can be triggered manually or when a Splatt walks over it.
   Although the Mine creates a fantastic explosion when detonated and can
   easily dispatch a weaker Rapid Splatt, a single Mine explosion by
   itself is not enough to kill an Alpha or Tank Splatt. Youâ€™ll have to
   plan a careful trap using a combination of tools to kill these guys.

                                    Mine

   Lava Pit

                                  Lava Pit

   The Splatts can be very child-like and, like any child, they enjoy a
   good game of â€˜The Floor Is Lavaâ€™. Only, for them, sometimes the floor
   is actually Lava. Splatts are pretty good at jumping over our carefully
   placed Lava Pits though, so youâ€™ll need to use other tools to coax them
   to have a swim in one.

                                  Lava Pit

   Once youâ€™ve successfully managed to get a Splatt into the Lava Pit, he
   will be set on fire and flail around for a few seconds before sinking
   to a fiery death.

   weapons in action (and maybe some sneak peaks at the weapons to come in
   the next part and beyond) please check out our social media pages which

Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 4

   Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 4

   Itâ€™s time for the next installment of our weapons rundown. This time
   weâ€™re looking at the Harpoon, Cake and Stun Bomb. Before we get started
   hereâ€™s a recap of which weapons and tools weâ€™ve covered previously:
   â€“ Bomb, Boulder, Spikes (Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 1)
   â€“ Single Use Bumpers, Multi-use Bumpers (Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“
   Part 2)
   â€“ Fan, Cannon, Slime (Weapons in 101 Ways To Die â€“ Part 3)

   Weâ€™ve also had some name changes, so for those of us who have read our
   previous Weapons blogs, Fodder are now called Franken-splatts (or
   Splatts for short) and there are three classes of Splatt â€“ read our
   â€˜Meet the Splatts!â€™ blog for more details on the new names.

   Harpoon

                                   Harpoon

   The Harpoon features both manual and automatic fire options, the
   automatic firing will be triggered if a Splatt passes through the red
   sensor area in front of the Harpoon. As the Harpoon is a very powerful
   tool, there is a 5 second reload time before the Harpoon can be fired
   again, which will prevent players from killing all Splatts using just a
   Harpoon. The force of being hit by a Harpoon bolt will throw a Splatt
   across a room towards any dangerous tools you might have placed there,
   which we think is far more fun than just using a Harpoon by itself to
   kill everything.

                                   Harpoon

   Early on in the development of the game Harpoons dealt 100% damage,
   resulting in an instant kill. This meant that some combos such as
   skewering a Splatt with a Harpoon bolt that would fling them into a
   mine would not work, as the Splatt would be dead before they hit the
   Mine. By lowering the Harpoonâ€™s damage slightly we have made it
   possible to achieve more variety of RIPs and combos, and as a result,
   more amusing deaths.

   Cake

                                    Cake

   The Cake is the ultimate distraction tool. When the Splatts see this
   sweet treat they will run straight for it, forgetting about the danger
   around them or their need to reach the exit. This can be an excellent
   strategy for delaying or diverting the Splatts so that they will walk
   right into your trap.

                                    Cake

   Such is their love of Cake that the Splatts can devour a whole cake in
   just a few seconds, so your window for deploying your dessert-based
   schemes will be short â€“ use this time wisely! Cake has a health
   indicator to let you know how quickly the cake is being used up, the
   more Splatts sharing the Cake, the quicker it will disappear. The Cake
   will also disappear if it is damaged by other tools (e.g. squished by a
   Boulder, blown up by a Mine etc.)

   Stun Bomb

                                  Stun Bomb

   A Stun Bomb creates a forceful â€˜pushâ€™ which will not directly cause
   damage to Splatts, but will cause them to become dazed and confused.
   This state only lasts for a few seconds, but while in this state the
   Splatts will not be aware of their surroundings so they will not
   attempt to avoid weapons or actively head towards the safety of the
   exit.

                                  Stun Bomb

   Stun Bombs can also be used to affect other tools, which very useful
   for setting your traps in motion. The Stun Bomb will be triggered
   automatically if a Splatt blunders into it, or can be triggered
   manually from the inventory menu, this method often requires precision
   timing to yield the most deadly results.

   (and maybe some sneak peaks at the weapons to come in part 5 and
   beyond) please check out our social media pages which are regularly

Meet The Splatts!

   Meet The Splatts!

   Those of you who have been following 101 Ways To Die for a while will
   know these adorably hideous creatures as â€˜Fodderâ€™.

                                [Mam_01.png]

   They are slow, dim-witted and we find it hilarious when they walk
   straight into the arms of death. Some of our tests have indicated that
   these uniform â€˜Fodderâ€™ clones do not provide enough challenge or
   variety, so we set out to fix that. The Fodder have been given a
   makeover, a name-change and some extraordinary new abilities.

   Professor Splattunfuder has been busy in his laboratory cultivating
   cells and splicing genes, and can now reveal his new creations which we
   call â€˜The Frankensplattsâ€™ (or â€˜Splattsâ€™ for short). There are three
   species of Splatts: Alpha, Tank and Rapid. Hereâ€™s the rundown on each.

   Alpha

                                 [Alpha.png]

   The Alpha Splatts â€“ affectionately called Alf by the Professor â€“ bear
   the closest resemblance to the old â€˜Fodderâ€™. They are the most
   primitive form of Splatt, the first of their kind, the â€˜Adamâ€™ of their
   species from which all other Splatts were created. These creatures have
   average speed and average health stats.

   Tank

                                 [Tank.png]

   A more advanced form of Splatt, the Tanks have evolved thicker skin and
   wear protective armour which give them higher than normal health stats.
   Tank Splatts can take twice the amount of damage as an Alpha Splatt,
   however all that armour weighs them down, causing them to move at half
   the speed.

   Rapid

                                 [Rapid.png]

   The final variant is the Rapid Splatt. As you might guess, the Rapid
   can move much faster than the Alpha and Tank Splatts but this extra
   speed comes at a cost. The Rapidâ€™s lighter build is less robust which
   results in a much lower health stat for this speedy Splatt.

   By having these three variations of Splatt the puzzles in our levels
   can be made more diverse and complex. For example some weapons do more
   damage than others, so sometimes you must carefully consider which
   order the Splatts need to be killed in or plan which weapons need to be
   used on each type of Splatt.

   As the assistant to the morally corrupt Professor Ernst Splattunfuder,
   you must help recreate '101 Ways To Die' - a book full of delightfully
    gory death recipes for dispatching your foes in the most stylish ways
                                  possible.

   With an arsenal of deadly tools at your disposal, find the most violent
    and brutal ways to maim, slice, burn, explode, rip and impale the lab
         created creatures known as Splatts. Don't let them escape!
