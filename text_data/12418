A complex firing Of MBDA’s Aster 30 successfully carried out at DGA missile
test centre

   The missile test division of the DGA carried out a complex test firing
   of the Aster 30 air defence missile on behalf of the French Navy at its
   Levant test centre. The firing scenario of the Aster 30 training
   missile launched from the Chevalier Paul air defence frigate involved
   an air target pursuing a friendly aircraft. The purpose of the test was
   to prove Aster 30’s ability to discriminate and intercept when dealing
   with two interlinked radar tracks.

   This elaborate scenario, created for the French Navy in cooperation
   with DGA Naval Technology and DGA Information Management, and using an
   instrumented training missile, allowed technical data to be collected
   giving precise details of the missile’s final interception phase.

   In addition to the main priority which was the safety of both personnel
   and property within a complex scenario that put three fast moving
   objects in flight, one of which was a missile fitted with measuring
   instrumentation, the challenge met by the DGA was to have two Mirach
   targets flying in close proximity to each other.

   The firing demonstrated the excellent qualities of the PAAMS system and
   its Aster missile in complex situations, notably under the conditions
   where friend and foe are in close proximity. It is one of the few
   systems currently in service in the world capable of such a
   performance.

   The PAAMS system, developed in cooperation between France, Italy and
   the UK, comprises a multi-functional radar, a surveillance radar, Aster
   15 and Aster 30 missiles, a vertical launch system and a command and
   control system. PAAMS provides self, local and fleet area defence.
