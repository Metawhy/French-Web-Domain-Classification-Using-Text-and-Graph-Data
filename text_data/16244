   The SMArT project is funded by the call ANR-DFG Programmes blancs 2013,
   a program of the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) and the
   (German) Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

   The objective of the SMArT project is to provide advanced techniques
   for arithmetic reasoning for formal system verification. During the
   last decade, there has been tremendous progress on symbolic
   verification techniques, spurred in particular by the development of
   SMT (satisfiability modulo theories) techniques and tools. SMT solvers
   are core engines that are successfully used for program verification,
   bounded and parameterized model checking, test generation, etc. They
   combine a SAT solver for deciding satisfiability of propositional logic
   with theory reasoners for deciding satisfiability of sets of literals
   over interpreted symbols, and instantiation techniques for handling
   quantifiers.

   Reasoning in various fragments of arithmetic is a fundamental and
   ubiquitous requirement in verification. Today's SMT solvers are mostly
   limited to quantifier-free formulas over linear arithmetic (i.e.,
   formulas involving only constants, +, and <), for which efficient
   decision procedures exist over both integer and real numbers. This
   fragment is sufficient for ensuring certain properties such as the
   absence of out-of-bound array accesses in simple heap-manipulating
   programs. Nevertheless, the linear fragment represents a severe
   restriction on expressiveness, and ideas have started to emerge on the
   support for stronger arithmetic fragments within SMT solvers.

   We propose to adapt known efficient techniques and algorithms to handle
   rich arithmetic fragments and for which mature solvers exist, so that
   they can be used within an SMT context. The advantages of such a
   combination are: (1) the arithmetic solver no longer needs to handle
   propositional operators, (2) the SMT solver gets access to a
   sophisticated infrastructure (data structures and algorithms) for
   handling much more expressive arithmetic fragments, (3) users benefit
   from the modular architecture of SMT solvers where arithmetic can be
   combined with other relevant theories.

   investigators or partners of SC², and the SMArT project has been
   instrumental in triggering SC-square. Check out also the community web
