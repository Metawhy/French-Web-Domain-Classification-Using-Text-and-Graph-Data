   "No cancer therapy is developed today without the genomic knowledge
   that ICGC provided to the world."

   The ICGC, established in 2007, aimed to define the genomes of 25,000
   primary untreated cancers (the 25K Initiative). The ICGC solved
   numerous data governance, ethical and logistical challenges to make
   global genomic data sharing for cancer possible, providing the
   international community with comprehensive genomic data for many cancer
   types.

   The second ICGC Initiative, the Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes
   (PCAWG), defined similarities and differences between cancer types.
   Based on this information, The ICGC for Medicine Initiative (ICGCmed)
   resolved the future strategy for the ICGC in a "White Paper", laying
   the foundation for the current ICGC Initiative ICGC-ARGO (Accelerating
   Research in Genomic Oncology), where key clinical questions and patient
   clinical data drive the interrogation of cancer genomes

Announcements

     * 16/May/2018 - The ICGC Secretariat was based at the Ontario
       Institute of Cancer Research in Toronto since its inception and its
       base of operations has now moved to The University of Glasgow,
       located in the City of Glasgow in the United Kingdom under the
       leadership of its new Executive Director, and Chairman, Professor
       Andrew Biankin.

     * 17/November/2017 - The ICGC Data Coordination Center (DCC) is
       pleased to announce ICGC data portal data release 26
       (http://dcc.icgc.org).
       ICGC data release 26 in total comprises data from more than 17,000
       cancer donors spanning 76 projects and 21 tumour sites.

     * 11/May/2017 - ICGC Open to new cancer genome projects: We are
       recruiting new ICGC projects to contribute to the world’s largest
       repository of cancer genomes. Interested? Contact Jennifer Jennings

       announce ICGC data portal data release 24 (http://dcc.icgc.org).
       ICGC data release 24 in total comprises data from more than 17,000
       cancer donors spanning 76 projects and 21 tumour sites.

     * 17/April/2016 - ICGCmed is pleased to announce the release of its
       white paper (http://icgcmed.org).
       The International Cancer Genome Consortium for Medicine (ICGCmed)
       will link genomics data to clinical information, health and
       responses to therapies.

     * 18/November/2015 - The International Cancer Genome Consortium
       (ICGC) PanCancer dataset generated by the PanCancer Analysis of
       Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is now available on Amazon Web Services
       (AWS), giving cancer researchers access to over 2,400 consistently
       analyzed genomes corresponding to over 1,100 unique ICGC donors
       (https://icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud).

Updates

     * Currently, the ICGC has received commitments from funding
       organizations in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South
       America for 88 project teams in 17 jurisdictions to study over
       25,000 tumor genomes. Projects that are currently funded are
       examining tumors affecting: the biliary tract, bladder, blood,
       bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, eye, head and neck, kidney,
       liver, lung, nasopharynx, oral cavity, ovary, pancreas, prostate,
       rectum, skin, soft tissues, stomach, thyroid and uterus. The
       genomic analyses of tumors conducted by ICGC members in Australia
       (ovarian and pancreatic cancer), Brazil (skin cancer), Canada
       (pancreatic, pediatric brain and prostate cancer), China (bladder,
       esophageal, gastric, lung and renal cancer), European Union/France
       (renal cancer), France (liver cancer), Germany (blood, brain and
       prostate cancer), India (oral cancer), Italy (pancreatic cancer),
       Japan (liver cancer), Saudi Arabia (thyroid cancer), Singapore
       (biliary tract cancer), South Korea (blood and lung cancer), Spain
       (blood cancer), the UK (blood, bone, breast, esophageal, lung,
       prostate and skin cancer) and the USA (bladder, blood, brain,
       breast, cervical, colon, gastric, head and neck, liver, lung,
       ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, renal, skin, thyroid and
       uterine cancer) are now available through the Data Coordination
       Center housed on the ICGC website at www.icgc.org.

   Project Summary

   The purpose of this project is to obtain comprehensive molecular
   (genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic) data of biliary tract cancers
   including intra/extra biliary tract and gall bladder cancers and to
   discover novel therapeutic targets. The data will further be jointly
   analyzed with the Singapore BTC project group to explore unique
   molecular signatures (mutational process or epigenetic/transcriptomic
   signature) associated with distinctive ethnic/epidemiological
   backgrounds.
