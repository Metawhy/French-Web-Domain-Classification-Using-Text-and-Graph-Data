   Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural
   flaws in the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic
   system that underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the
   reliability and effectiveness of encrypted Internet connections and can
   compromise critical TLS/SSL mechanisms, including domain validation,
   end-to-end encryption, and the chains of trust set up by certificate
   authorities. If left unchecked, these flaws can facilitate a wide range
   of security attacks, such as website spoofing, server impersonation,
   and man-in-the-middle attacks.
   [ct_home_security.png?height=162&amp;width=320]
   Certificate Transparency helps eliminate these flaws by providing an
   open framework for monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in nearly
   real time. Specifically, Certificate Transparency makes it possible to
   detect SSL certificates that have been mistakenly issued by a
   certificate authority or maliciously acquired from an otherwise
   unimpeachable certificate authority. It also makes it possible to
   identify certificate authorities that have gone rogue and are
   maliciously issuing certificates.
   Because it is an open and public framework, anyone can build or access
   the basic components that drive Certificate Transparency. This is
   particularly beneficial to Internet security stakeholders, such as
   domain owners, certificate authorities, and browser manufacturers, who
   have a vested interest in maintaining the health and integrity of the
   SSL certificate system.
   To learn more about Certificate Transparency, read the introductory
   documentation. If you're already familiar with the basic concepts of
   Certificate Transparency and you want to dive deeper into the
   implementation details, take a look at the detailed design
   documentation. We also have an open source project that shows you how
   to build some of the key components that drive the Certificate
   Transparency framework.
   The 'trans' IETF WG was established to create a standard RFC for
   Certificate Transparency.
