21st European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
Bordeaux July 20-31, 2009

   The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
   is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
   Information (FoLLI) in different sites around Europe. The main focus of
   ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and computation.
   ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well
   as workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas
   of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic
   and Computation.
   ESSLLI 2009 à Bordeaux
   Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
   500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into
   an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
   researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
   Language and Information. During two weeks, around 40 lectures and 10
   workshops are proposed to the attendants, each of 1.5 hour per day
   during a five day week, with up to seven parallel sessions. ESSLLI also
   includes a student session (papers and posters by students only, 1.5
   hour per day during the two weeks) and four evening lecture by senior
   scientists of the covered areas.
   The sites of the last ESSLLI give a pretty good idea of what ESSLLI
   looks like: Hamburg 2008, Dublin 2007, Malaga 2006, Edinburgh 2005,
   Nancy 2004.
