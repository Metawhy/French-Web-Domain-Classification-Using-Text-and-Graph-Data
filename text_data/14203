Bye, Typepad.

   Bye, Typepad

   I have moved to Blogger.   My address is still wagonized.com but the
   blog is now

   here.

   Going to the typepad blog made any Safari app on iOS crash.

   So this is my 934th and last post on this platform! Bye, Typepad.

What's in front of you

   I have been drawing what was in front of me these past few days. There
   is nothing like sketching the first thing in your line of vision to
   shake off the old anxiety-inducing "what am I gonna draw" question.
   Just sit your butt down -- or not -- and draw what's in front of you.
   Be it a cello or a corner of your coffee table. More on my Tumblr.

Red pepper

   If you ever need a red pepper to look like a (metallic, apparently)
   tooth, call on me, I am your (wo)man.  I will try color next time.

Hampton Diner

   2mn sketch at the diner

   I can't think of a better exercise for sketching fast than a quick
   doodle before your food comes at the diner.  To hell with proportions,
   colors and steady lines.  The goal is to loosen up the hand, let go of
   perfection, let go of anything decent for that matter, and just sketch.
    And if the food hasn't arrived yet, add some color.

Loft beds, state-wide testings and French verbs

   This is what has been going on. Some building, some testing and as
   always, some teaching (and hopefully some learning). The Pencil tool
   for the Paper app has been nothing short of a "homecoming". The comfort
   of being able to rest one's palm on the surface of the iPad has made
   Paper feel as close to actual paper (=home) as possible. And the app
   keeps getting better.

House Of Cards

   Watching Season 2 of House Of Cards makes it nearly impossible to
   finish a drawing. Or anything else, for that matter.

   after 2 months of use so far).

Year of the horse

   It's the year of the horse. Happy new year!

   While I see some amazing art being produced with the Paper app, my own
   lack of knowledge of color and painting confines me to a very
   pen-on-paper kind of approach.

Journal Bandolier

   How neat it is to carry around iPad and styluses (stylii?) thanks to a
   cool little convenient journal bandolier, made by Emily at
   cleverhands.net.

The best dip, in good company

   6-layer dip, straight from heaven I made my best dip the other day and
   felt like sharing.  We ate it at our friends' house, while the football
   game was on.  That's when I doodled.

Lady for sale

   I found a super well-kept 1993 Volvo 240 wagon for sale but it lacks
   two important features: a manual transmission and a roof rack. But I
   keep looking. The one I used to own had over 200K miles on it, and
   strangely enough, I do not have a single picture of it.

First post of 2014

   Image

   2014 has a nice ring to it. I drew a piece of our living room, the
   warmest spot in the house on a cold New Year's Eve. Before and after
   coloring.

   As it turns out, my husband Tom is featured in the Handmade
   Photograph today!

Off to the new year

   I have been posting more on Tumblr lately than here.  And because I
   have been test-drawing my new Pencil, I have been using the iPad almost
   exclusively -- hence all the drawings done on Paper by 53.

   Happy new year to all, and may drawing happen on a daily basis!

Sweet

   I have finally received my Pencil through the mail and it's been a fun
   experience so far. I am preparing a full review of Pencil for which I
   will post a link. The mere shape of it makes so much sense: once its
   magnet secures it to the iPad cover, you are good to go.

Will this be a big deal?

   I purchased a Pencil by Fifty Three and cannot wait for it to make its
   way to my mailbox so I can decide whether it's a big fricken deal or
   not. I adopted and loved the Paper app from the moment it came out, and
   I am curious to know what it will be like to have a tool which allows
   for my hand to rest on the screen while I draw. My guess is, it will
   most likely be a big deal.

Ellipses

   Can of Coke

   You'd think I've got this thing down: and ellipse at the top of the can
   and one at the bottom.  And I still get it approximately at best.


   I have ordered my Pencil for the Paper app (I got the walnut) and
   cannot wait to try it out.

Yawn

   Yawn. There, before going to sleep tonight -- a big yawn on the iPad.

   My next purchase is this, by the way.

Living in a box

   I am captivated by the tiny house movement. I think these people have
   it all figured out. Tinier is better. Paper app for the iPad.

Le Petit Parisien

   Apparently, one can find French people outside of New York City now.
   They (we?!) are slowly making our way into the American suburbs, one
   pastry shop at a time.

A few stolen minutes

   Montclair movies

   When you carry a sketchbook around, you welcome a text from the people
   you are supposed to meet that says "We're running a few minutes late".
    Wednesday night, Montclair, NJ.

Growing mess and a new stylus

   The growing mess on my desk: lesson plans, hard drives, lip balm, a
   candle that smells like cookies and some store receipts.

   I just bought a new Wacom Bamboo stylus to sketch on the iPad and I am
   wondering what I had been thinking using cheaper alternatives. The way
   the Bamboo glides on the surface of the tablet is what I had been
   looking for for months.

Classroom requests!

   Photo Oct 02, 9 38 34 PM Photo Oct 02, 9 28 46 PM

   I have been drawing for my classes lately.  We are doing classroom
   requests with my Freshmen ("Je peux recharger ma tablette, SVP?"), and
   in my mind, a little doodle is always better than a translation.
