   LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 15: BET NETWORKS Hosts an Exclusive Dinner &
   Performance for upcoming docuseries "Death Row Chronicles" about the
   rise and fall of the world's most dangerous record label at NeueHouse

   The label that helped make Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg famous now shares a
   home with Mr. Potato Head.

   Hasbro, a massive toy company that is the source of countless hours of
   childhood joy — thanks to Mr. Potato Head, Monopoly, G.I. Joe,
   Transformers, My Little Pony, Power Rangers, and much, much more —
   announced on Thursday that it will join forces with Death Row Records,
   a label synonymous with West Coast gangster rap thanks to artists like
   Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac.

   More precisely, Hasbro purchased Entertainment One, a multimedia
   company that owns the children’s franchises Peppa Pig and PJ Masks
   (these are apparently popular among the youth, though they surely pale
   in comparison with Mr. Potato Head). Entertainment One also has a music
   division, which happens to be one of the biggest independent labels in
   the industry — it took in more than $30 million in revenue in the first
   quarter of 2019. And back in 2013, eOne acquired the catalog of Death
   Row, which had previously been forced to declare bankruptcy in 2006.

   The cross-branding opportunities here basically write themselves, but
   there is no word on whether a Death Row Records-themed Monopoly game is
   forthcoming. There are, however, “$130 million in cost synergies”
   available to both companies if they pass Go by 2022, according to
   Deadline.

   In a statement, Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner celebrated his purchase. “The
   acquisition of eOne adds beloved story-led global family brands that
   deliver strong operating returns to Hasbro’s portfolio and provides a
   pipeline of new brand creation driven by family-oriented storytelling,”
   he said.

   Mr. Potato Head and the Power Rangers did not respond to requests for
   comment.

Young Thug Never Stopped Believing in Himself (Even If You Did)

   Cole executive-produced the new album, Lil Baby and Gunna appearing on

   Young Thug

   Young Thug wants to talk about faith. More specifically, he wants to
   talk about the faith that we should have in him, the kind he’s always
   had in himself. At numerous points during our phone conversation, he
   dances around the low points of the last few years and the arrests,
   familial struggles, commercial disappointments, and the critical
   grumblings that followed. Instead, Thug wants to bask in the positivity
   of this moment and the potential in the immediate future. His latest
   album, So Much Fun, is projected to sell between 125,000 – 150,000
   equivalent album units in its first week, which is not only the biggest
   solo week of his career, but good enough to potentially notch him his
   first chart-topping album. The project’s lead single, “The London,”
   which features J. Cole and Travis Scott, is the most successful single
   as a lead artist of his career and everyone from Post Malone to Ed
   Sheeran to Lil Nas X have employed his talents in recent months.

   “I’ve been going through the storm,” he says. “Once this album goes
   number one, the storm is over. The storm been calmed. That’s one of the
   main reasons why I wanted it to be fun, because I felt like this album
   was going to go number one. I felt like it was going to be the
   highest-charting album in my career. I felt like everything that’s
   happening; I felt that it would happen and deep down I was going
   through a lot. That’s why I wanted to make it So Much Fun, because I
   wanted to really fall back on this and be like, ‘Damn, this is really
   [how I] overcome oppression and struggle.'”

   After a half-decade of industry and media-led prognostication, Thug’s
   market heights finally match his outsized influence. In conversation,
   the Atlanta wunderkind dissolves all preconceived notions that have
   built up over the years about the formerly reclusive star. The central
   narrative of Thug’s career was one of inflexibility — of interviews
   avoided, rollouts botched, unending leaks, projects seemingly abandoned
   — but now, at least over the phone, he radiates a calm energy. Thug
   knows he’s built a career on his inscrutable nature, but his evolution
   leading a new generation of stars (Gunna, Lil Keed) on his YSL Records
   and having conversations with the likes of Jay-Z make the future clear,
   at least to him. Someone needs to be the new Tupac.

   If projections hold true, So Much Fun, will be your highest first sales
   week. Does commercial success like that matter to you?
   No, it don’t really matter to me, because it’s a sport. It’s not
   numbers to me, but it matters, the growth. I just want people to know
   that there’s a such thing as growing. There’s a such thing as faith,
   have faith in me. That’s the only reason why I care about the numbers
   at this point. Other than that I don’t really care about numbers,
   because I’ve seen artists sell a million records in a week and can’t
   sell out a show. They sell out 5,000 tickets, but you sold a million
   copies in one week. I’ve seen artists sell 10,000 copies, and then your
   tour sell out as soon as you put it on the market. I don’t really care
   for that. The only reason why I care for it this time is because I want
   people to see the growth and [have] faith in me.

   Emotionally or mentally, where were you at during the creation of this
   album?
   I’ve always had faith. So it wasn’t nothing that I was going through
   that I didn’t have faith or didn’t think could be done or happen. It
   was more about faith and perfect timing with me. I feel like it was the
   perfect time to put it out. My headspace was perfect. I always had a
   perfect headspace when it came to music even if my money was low, even
   if I had problems at home or even if I had problems in the real world
   or even if I had doubters or even if I had open cases or judgmental
   people. I never ever cracked under pressure on those types of things. I
   always kept a balance, and I was able to overcome any type of obstacle.

   Did J. Cole really executive produce the album?
   You guys have to ask him that. We have non-disclosures. We have forms
   we have to sign. He’s kind of like a prince at this point. It’s like,
   if anything comes out about him, he would like for him to put it out.

   There have been a lot more videos, interviews, and high-profile
   features for you this year. What inspired you to do be more open with
   your fans and with press?
   The fact that I never let people in and I always stayed tight when it
   came to that, because of critics. You know just simple things. Things
   that wouldn’t tear me down, but things that would tear people around me
   down, those sorts of things.

   For much of 2018, it felt like you were investing in YSL and all the
   artists that you have on that label. How does being a label boss differ
   from your individual career?
   My career is more about me, more about my label, sitting down having
   meetings discussing my business, my life, my whereabouts, my
   where-beings, and the label is nothing about me. It’s all about other
   people.

   How does it feel seeing Lil Keed and Gunna becoming stars in their own
   right?
   I feel naturally happy about it. I think I always knew the ground that
   those guys could shake-up. It wasn’t much of a surprise with me as it
   was with you guys and critics and fans. It wasn’t such a surprise for
   me, because I’ve always believed Gunna, Keed, and Lil Baby to be exact
   all of those these like my lil’ brothers. I done gave all them the game
   from my standpoint.

   What was it like collaborating with a Lil Baby or Gunna on this album?
   You sound rejuvenated. It seems like a different Thug when you’re on a
   track with them.
   Just those guys being who they are and coming up in the game and being
   able to take care of family and do things that I’ve been able to do for
   the past 10 years, it just gives me a different type of boost. Then me
   knowing that I was one of the reasons that they’re where they are. You
   know, on a very humble scale, I was one of the reasons not physically,
   but mentally. I was a real mentor for these guys lives to keep them on
   the path that they’re on. Don’t spend money. Don’t do this. Don’t make
   the mistakes I’ve [made]. It makes me so happy.

   These guys are making a way for themselves, and I really wanted this.
   It’s not nothing that just had to happen. It’s not like “Lil Baby ‘bout
   to blow up so you got to gottdamn ride his coattails.” It’s like nah,
   Lil Baby was my little brother. I was giving Lil Baby 20,000, 50,000
   dollars. Me and him just swapping money with each other before he start
   rapping. It wasn’t about an image. It was more about real love and
   purity, structure. That’s what keeps me boosted is seeing those guys be
   able to do what I’ve been doing and keeping it up and not falling off.

   Do you still enjoy being a rapper or does the life of being a celebrity
   ever get to you?
   I prayed for it my whole life. So I don’t think I ever be over it. I
   enjoy it every single day. I enjoy taking pictures. I enjoy people
   asking for pictures even the days I don’t take pictures I still enjoy
   people asking me. If I don’t take pictures I be like, “No, I don’t like
   taking pictures, but thank you so much.” I can’t ever get tired of it.
   I hear other artists saying they get tired and it’s draining. I don’t
   understand. Maybe they didn’t have the dream I had. I always dreamed
   for these things. So I don’t think I can ever get tired of it, because
   I really prayed for it.

   What will separate Punk from So Much Fun?
   So Much Fun is like nothing to be thought about. It’s only for fun
   purposes. The name of the album is directly what it means. There’s no
   static to it. It’s just so much fun. I don’t even want you to think
   when you listen to this even if I’m saying a metaphorical bars or
   anything. I don’t want it to be nothing thought too hard about. I want
   it to be only party. If you’re not partying, if it’s not Friday you
   just got your paycheck you in the car with your friends, if you not in
   the club drunk, if you not just having fun doing whatever you feel
   like, don’t play this album.

   The difference from that and Punk is Punk is me letting them in on my
   real life. Me letting them know all the situations I’ve been through.
   Opening up, letting the fans in, I feel like I never let ‘em. I feel
   like I was always quite about certain things, because of people.

   With people starting to rank the best albums of the decade, personally
   which of your albums do you think is your best or favorite?
   I would like to say Punk is, even though it’s not out. My best album
   would probably be Punk, because it’s more like real life. It’s more
   like Tupac. Tupac could be one of the biggest rappers in the world,
   because he rapped what he rapped about. I had conversations with Jay-Z
   and he told me, ‘We gotta learn how to continue what Pac had going. Pac
   was a teacher. Pac teaches.’ This album Punk that I’m going to put out
   soon is probably going to be the best album, because it really teaches
   you, gives you life situations, it’s teaching I’m human. I am you. I am
   him. It’s very verbal. I think it’ll probably be the best album even
   though it’s not out.

   What inspired you and Future to include Lil Baby and Gunna on Super
   Slimey 2?
   The impact that Lil Baby [and Gunna had] when they dropped theirs
   [project]. We always compared it like “Damn, there’s no such thing as a
   better duo, except those guys.” Then these like our little brothers,
   for real. Future really dropped knowledge on these guys. We dropped
   knowledge on each other. Sometimes they drop knowledge on us to now. We
   dropped knowledge on these guys and we feel like it’s just the right
   thing to do. Anything other than that is unacceptable. Like saying that
   there’s not a better duo or anything than Gunna and Baby was. So I feel
   like we needed to combine those two, Super Slimey 2.

   What do you personally think is the biggest misconception people still
   have about you?
   Who I am. I’m still misunderstood.

   Do you think people will ever understand who you are?
   People still misunderstood. You know I’m going to put this album out
   Punk, and it’s going to let them know a little about my life, let them
   know a little bit about life itself. I don’t think I want to make them
   to understand. I like to say that I’m misunderstood. It keeps it tense.
   It keeps it perfect.

2020 Candidate Andrew Yang Takes a Stand Against … Circumcision

   One of the strangest campaigns in the crowded Democratic primary field
   just got a little stranger

   Andrew Yang, a candidate in the Democratic primaries for president,
   speaks at a town hall meeting sponsored by the Euclid chapter of the
   NAACP at Christ Lutheran Church in ClevelandElection 2020 Yang,
   Cleveland, USA - 24 Feb 2019

   Phil Long/AP/REX/Shutterstock

   A few months ago, Andrew Yang was the longest of long shots to land the
   Democratic nomination. Now, he’s polling as a fringe contender, thanks
   in part to some outside-the-box policy proposals that have gained
   traction in certain corners of the Internet. In a recent interview with
   the Daily Beast, Yang became the first, and likely only, 2020 candidate
   to take a stand against circumcision. “I’m highly aligned with the
   intactivists,” he said. “History will prove them even more correct.”

   Not only does Yang, 44, align himself with intactivists, a name for
   those who oppose circumcision, he wants to incorporate the position
   into public policy. “From what I’ve seen, the evidence on it being a
   positive health choice for the infant is quite shaky,” added Yang, who
   has no plans to ban circumcision, only to “inform parents that it is
   entirely up to them whether their infant gets circumcised, and that
   there are costs and benefits either way.”

     Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang comes out against circumcision,
     says "Intactivist" will be part of his political coalition.

     — Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 19, 2019

   “The more choice we give parents, and the more we diminish the possible
   preconceptions or misinformation various parents are receiving, then
   the better off we’ll be as a society,” he said.

   Circumcision has been found to reduce the risk of urinary tract
   infections in infants and sexually transmitted diseases in men. The
   practice has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and
   recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But UTIs
   in infants are rare and treatable, and intactivists believe there are
   better ways to reduce the risk of STDs than performing surgery on an
   infant’s genitals. “I think there’s nothing more inhumane than tying
   down a baby or a child and amputating a healthy, normal part of his
   body,” Intact America founder Georganne Chapin told the Daily Beast,
   adding that she thinks Yang’s campaign slogan, “Humanity First,” is
   “awesome.”

   On Tuesday morning, Yang offered parents an additional piece of advice.

     Would Zion Williamson be so epic if his name were Charles? Parents
     take note.

     — Andrew Yang (@AndrewYangVFA) March 19, 2019

   Yang’s candidacy initially drew attention because of his proposal to
   institute a universal basic income — or “Freedom Dividend” — of $1,000
   per month, largely in an effort to offset the effects of the job loss
   that will result from automation. “If you’re dealing with an economic
   shift this historic, then you need to bring real solutions to bear that
   are going to help people manage the transition,” he told Rolling Stone
   in January. “And the most efficient way to do that is a universal basic
   income.”

   A month after speaking with Rolling Stone, Yang appeared on the popular
   Joe Rogan Experience podcast. He started to develop a cult following.
   “Everything is up and to the right since the Joe Rogan podcast,”
   campaign manager Zach Graumann told the Daily Beast earlier this month.
   “That was the key. That was the moment.”

   Yang’s unexpected rise was nurtured in corners of the Internet like
   Reddit and 4chan, and often with the help of the #MAGA sect, which took
   to Yang’s proposal to give every American adult $1,000 per month, no
   strings attached. Memes abounded. The #YangGang was born.

     Did Trump just lose the 2020 meme war? Memers flock to
     @andrewYangVFA's campaign centered around AI mass job loss requiring
     universal basic income (UBI) after mentions on @JoeRogan and
     @WikiLeaks. See #Yanggang and #yanggang2020 for thousands of
     examples. pic.twitter.com/n7vxeMN4l2

     — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 8, 2019

   According to a report from Axios published Tuesday morning, Yang has
   received more mentions on 4chan and 8chan than any other Democratic
   candidate. But as his candidacy has taken root in far-right hotbeds,
   it’s unclear how much of the support is sincere, and how much is part
   of a tongue-in-cheek effort to introduce chaos into the Democratic
   primary and elevate a candidate users believe will increase President
   Trump’s chances of winning in 2020.

   Regardless, Yang’s heightened profile has yielded more than a few
   memes. Last week, his campaign announced it had received contributions
   from 65,000 unique donors, the threshold necessary to qualify for the
   first two Democratic debates. Shortly before making the announcement,
   Yang tweeted that he believed one his donors was Nicolas Cage. Cage’s
   manager later confirmed to Rolling Stone that the actor did indeed
   donate to Yang’s campaign and that he supports his candidacy.

   Again, this is a strange campaign.

Inside Carlos Santana’s New Jazz-Rock Supergroup

   No matter who you are or what skills you bring to the table, starting a
   new band with keyboardist Herbie Hancock and saxophonist Wayne Shorter,
   two of the jazz world’s most iconic luminaries, is serious business.
   Not so serious, though, that Carlos Santana, a legend in his own right,
   hesitates to crack wise about the origin of Mega Nova, the jazz-rock
   supergroup he’s formed with Hancock, Shorter and two more heavyweight
   players: bassist Marcus Miller and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana, the
   guitarist’s wife.

   “I asked them if it was OK for me to start a rumor that we were going
   to do something together, and they said, ‘Of course,'” Santana tells
   Rolling Stone, laughing. “So I started a rumor, and here we are. And I
   feel so excited, because with these musicians, anything and everything
   can be transmitted.”

   The new band, Mega Nova – named in tribute to Shorter’s 1969 solo album
   Super Nova – will make its debut in a one-off concert at the Hollywood
   Bowl on August 24th. It’s not the first time these players have met
   onstage; most of the band members have played together on various
   occasions, and Santana and Shorter toured together in 1988. Shorter and
   Hancock collaborated with Santana in a program called “Hymns for Peace”
   at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2004, and Miller and Blackman Santana
   were among the supporting musicians that joined the core triumvirate
   for a Hancock-led event, “Celebrating Peace,” at the Hollywood Bowl in
   2012.

   “Carlos is a big jazz fan, a big supporter of the music,” Hancock tells
   RS. “With his heart, he honors jazz. But it’s not just words; it’s also
   his deeds. This is the kind of action that he’s taken to include jazz,
   because he has so much respect for it, and he respects Wayne and me –
   as we respect him: as a musician, as a storyteller in music. Nobody can
   deliver a melody like Carlos.”

   The admiration is mutual, emphatically so. “For me, this is a real
   blessing,” Santana says, “to dream of something, and then to see it
   come to fruition.” To be in the company of Shorter and Hancock – whose
   work with trumpeter and bandleader Miles Davis in the mid-1960s
   launched trailblazing careers in jazz, fusion and pop, individually and
   in collaboration – is a lesson in humility, as Santana describes it.

   How does Santana find common ground with his illustrious comrades? “It
   starts with surrender,” he says without hesitation. “I immediately
   defer to both of them, and I wait my turn to see when they invite me to
   come up with something. I’m very honored and grateful that they trust
   me. So for me, it’s about learning to defer – I learned that word from
   Magic Johnson, when he said he deferred to [Kareem] Abdul-Jabbar. It
   means you have the courtesy to honor those who came before you.”

   Respect also animates Blackman Santana’s approach to Mega Nova –
   specifically, her admiration for Tony Williams, the trailblazing
   drummer who worked in Davis’ band with Hancock and Shorter, and for
   Jack DeJohnette, the protean percussionist who played on Davis sessions
   as well as Shorter’s Super Nova.

   “Tony is to me unparalleled in his sound concept, the amount of things
   he innovated on and with,” she tells RS. “From tuning my drums to
   concepts of playing inside the music, taking drum solos, composition –
   he’s influenced me in every way.” DeJohnette, she notes, started as a
   pianist, “so he approaches [drumming] in a very musical way. He’s got a
   lot of good energy, a lot of good fire. And he puts together really
   good projects.”

   Blackman Santana, a noted bandleader and composer who has collaborated
   with such heavyweights as Lenny Kravitz, Cream’s Jack Bruce and Living
   Colour’s Vernon Reid, holds Hancock and Shorter in special esteem. “Not
   only is it a pleasure and an honor to play with them, but it’s also a
   challenge to step up to them,” she says. “If I can somehow make those
   cats feel inspired, I’ll feel like I’ve reached the mountaintop.”

   But as Shorter sees it, Mega Nova has to provide optimal conditions for
   Blackman Santana, as well. “She needs to be free from any kind of rigid
   arrangements,” he tells RS. Shorter cites two performances of “The
   Star-Spangled Banner” that Santana and Blackman Santana played before
   NBA Finals games in 2015 and 2016. “They were respectful,” he says,
   “but Cindy had carte blanche. She was playing riffs and rises” –
   Shorter reels off rhythms and rolls vocally, illustrating Blackman
   Santana’s unbridled free playing.

   That boundless exuberance is consistent with what Shorter set out to
   express on Super Nova, the first album he recorded after leaving Miles
   Davis’ band. “When you’re going fishing, you want to throw the line out
   as far as you can,” he says. “I was throwing the music at a distance,
   where it would challenge me, and also sharing the challenge – like when
   you’re kids playing, maybe in a vacant lot, and you play all day and
   you’d discover stuff. It’s like, what are you going to do after you
   leave Miles Davis? So, Super Nova: You’re on your own, you’re an
   astronaut – let’s jump out into space.”

     “The whole concept of building something together: That’s what this
     is about.” –Herbie Hancock

   Even so, every astronaut knows careful planning and a safety tether are
   crucial to success and survival. “The best improvisation has a solid
   base,” says Miller, a celebrated bassist known for his work with Luther
   Vandross and with Miles Davis in the 1980s. He recounts something the
   great arranger and producer Quincy Jones once told him: “The biggest
   hindrance to creativity is a blank page.” Impose a few parameters, he
   recalls Jones saying, and creativity flowers instantly.

   “When you’re an improviser, it’s a really ethereal kind of thing,
   because you’re not really sure what you’re going to do when you go
   onstage,” Miller tells RS. “This is kind of a freaky feeling, to be
   standing there with 7,000 people waiting for us, and we don’t really
   know exactly what it is that’s going to happen out there. Imagine that
   feeling – it’s a huge leap of faith.”

   Both Santana and Hancock view that collaborative uncertainty as an
   accurate reflection of Mega Nova’s design and ideals. “We have hearts
   that are very compatible in the way we look at the world, the way we
   look at humanity, and our responsibility as human beings, as musicians,
   as storytellers from the cultural community,” Hancock says. The
   inevitability and necessity of globalization, he notes, is a key
   concern.

   “We have the capacity for creating a world that we can all believe in,
   one that we can look forward to for ourselves and our children,”
   Hancock says. “What we want to do is make a step toward bringing
   cultures and ethnicities and people in general together, and show the
   value of collaboration from the standpoint of respect. The whole
   concept of building something together: That’s what this is about.”

   Santana is even more pointed about the objective. “I want to be able to
   travel with this band eventually, and be the peace ambassadors, which
   is what Louis Armstrong used to be, and what I would say Bob Marley or
   John Lennon represented,” he says. “Let me say really clearly: Wayne
   and Herbie and I and Cindy and Marcus, we are the frequency to do the
   opposite of Donald Trump. We don’t see walls – we saw the Berlin Wall
   come down. We’ve been to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we saw what that
   stuff is. We play music to bring, once and for all, inclusiveness and
   family. This is the band.”

   New Order

   New Order are currently recording tracks for their 10th studio album.

   Buda Mendes/Getty

   When New Order went on tour this past summer — three years after
   reporting that they were done for good — the band played a single new
   track amid a set heavy on classic hits. The band had worked on the
   song, titled “Plastic,” between the gigs that were supposed to be their
   last; and now it will appear on their 10th studio LP. “The shows were
   being well-received and we were enjoying it,” singer-guitarist Bernard
   Sumner, 59, tells Rolling Stone. “It seemed like the logical thing to
   do.”

   Drummer Stephen Morris says that new material “has been small steps
   coming since 2011,” but this past December he and his bandmates started
   moving faster, recording for the first time since bassist Peter Hook
   left the band in 2007. The current lineup welcomes back Gillian
   Gilbert, the keyboardist who last played on 2001’s Get Ready, and adds
   Bad Lieutenant members Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. Sumner says
   that the new configuration has made the band more flexible, allowing
   different members to move across guitars, keys and backing vocals. “The
   lines have gotten a bit blurrier than they used to be,” he says. “We’ve
   become songwriters instead of instrumentalists.”

   why

   Still, recording has become less glamorous since the days when the band
   hung out at Manchester’s Haçienda nightclub and producer Arthur Baker
   rushed their “Confusion” reel-to-reel straight to the DJ booth at New
   York’s Funhouse. “We used to just play for hours jamming in the studio
   and then find a bit — a second — that wasn’t bad,” says Morris. “And
   then find another second that could go on top of that. Now we’ve become
   a bit more professional in recording, for better or for worse. We’re
   streamlined.”

   He and Gilbert — the couple married in 1994 — have spent the last
   decade raising their family on a farm outside of Manchester, and the
   band that brought the couple together has once again occupied their
   home. “Me and Gillian have long conversations about music all the time
   when we should be doing other stuff,” says Morris, whose daughter Tilly
   plays keys in a group called Hot Vestry. “It’s like, blimey, we did it
   again! Once we watched a box set of Breaking Bad, and we shut up while
   doing that. We’re just waiting for another one to divert us from going
   on and on about New Order.”

   Over in London, Sumner’s creative process is a little more insular.
   “It’s rainy and cold and wet outside,” he says. “It’s dark. It’s a good
   time to write.”

   Morris laughs knowingly when he hears this. “That explains a lot of the
   band’s content, doesn’t it?” he asks. “Bernard likes to be alone while
   writing – alone with his wine.”

   The band has thus far completed two tracks: “Plastic” and “Restless,”
   which features Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands. Morris says that the
   record will keep true to New Order’s sound while taking advantage of
   newer drum and synth programming technology, adding that he thinks
   “production is going in reverse now.”

   “A lot of people have started using old analog stuff even though it has
   no memory,” he explains. “I fool around with modular synths because you
   create a sound by accident. There’s a lot of noise, and then you’d stop
   and see something great. There’s something spontaneous about it. You
   don’t really get that anymore.”

   Morris’ nostalgia is particularly endearing given his band’s
   overwhelming influence on the last 15 years of electro and dance-punk.
   With equal passion he praises the krautrock drums of Neu! and Can and
   the younger generation that has taken New Order’s innovations into the
   new millenium. “I absolutely love James Murphy and DFA,” says Morris.
   “We toured with Holy Ghost!, which was fantastic. Everything they do is
   incredible: It’s what we were doing years ago only they’re doing it for
   now.”

   Adds Sumner: “I don’t think you can say that anyone is doing what New
   Order does but musicians are all influenced by their record
   collections. Our earliest influences were Bowie and Iggy Pop and
   Kraftwerk and songwriters like Neil Young before that. Instead of
   changing things in a negative way, [the bands influenced by New Order]
   are giving it new life.”

   Appropriately, the band will be releasing this LP — hopefully sometime
   in Autumn — on Mute, home to a roster of synth-loving electronic
   artists including Zola Jesus, Arca and Depeche Mode. Founder Daniel
   Miller acts as the band’s informal soundboard. “I don’t think we’d ever
   finish if we didn’t have someone to tell us to stop,” says Morris.
   “It’s hard to let something you’re working on go.” When the record
   comes out, Sumner says that fans should expect a heavy electronic sound
   with melodic guitars and “an orchestral feel.”

   “Some people may say that electronic music is cold and unromantic,”
   Sumner says, referencing their hit “Blue Monday” as a example of how a
   song can be both robotic and emphatic. “That’s true in a way, but now a
   computer is able to translate exactly what your brain is thinking.
   That’s exciting. It’s what we were trying to achieve in the 1980s.”

   LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 15: BET NETWORKS Hosts an Exclusive Dinner &
   Performance for upcoming docuseries "Death Row Chronicles" about the
   rise and fall of the world's most dangerous record label at NeueHouse
   Hollywood on February 15, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by

   The label that helped make Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg famous now shares a
   home with Mr. Potato Head.

   Hasbro, a massive toy company that is the source of countless hours of
   childhood joy — thanks to Mr. Potato Head, Monopoly, G.I. Joe,
   Transformers, My Little Pony, Power Rangers, and much, much more —
   announced on Thursday that it will join forces with Death Row Records,
   a label synonymous with West Coast gangster rap thanks to artists like
   Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac.

   More precisely, Hasbro purchased Entertainment One, a multimedia
   company that owns the children’s franchises Peppa Pig and PJ Masks
   (these are apparently popular among the youth, though they surely pale
   in comparison with Mr. Potato Head). Entertainment One also has a music
   division, which happens to be one of the biggest independent labels in
   the industry — it took in more than $30 million in revenue in the first
   quarter of 2019. And back in 2013, eOne acquired the catalog of Death
   Row, which had previously been forced to declare bankruptcy in 2006.

   The cross-branding opportunities here basically write themselves, but
   there is no word on whether a Death Row Records-themed Monopoly game is
   forthcoming. There are, however, “$130 million in cost synergies”
   available to both companies if they pass Go by 2022, according to
   Deadline.

   In a statement, Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner celebrated his purchase. “The
   acquisition of eOne adds beloved story-led global family brands that
   deliver strong operating returns to Hasbro’s portfolio and provides a
   pipeline of new brand creation driven by family-oriented storytelling,”
   he said.

   Mr. Potato Head and the Power Rangers did not respond to requests for
   comment.

Young Thug Never Stopped Believing in Himself (Even If You Did)

   Cole executive-produced the new album, Lil Baby and Gunna appearing on

   Young Thug

   Young Thug wants to talk about faith. More specifically, he wants to
   talk about the faith that we should have in him, the kind he’s always
   had in himself. At numerous points during our phone conversation, he
   dances around the low points of the last few years and the arrests,
   familial struggles, commercial disappointments, and the critical
   grumblings that followed. Instead, Thug wants to bask in the positivity
   of this moment and the potential in the immediate future. His latest
   album, So Much Fun, is projected to sell between 125,000 – 150,000
   equivalent album units in its first week, which is not only the biggest
   solo week of his career, but good enough to potentially notch him his
   first chart-topping album. The project’s lead single, “The London,”
   which features J. Cole and Travis Scott, is the most successful single
   as a lead artist of his career and everyone from Post Malone to Ed
   Sheeran to Lil Nas X have employed his talents in recent months.

   “I’ve been going through the storm,” he says. “Once this album goes
   number one, the storm is over. The storm been calmed. That’s one of the
   main reasons why I wanted it to be fun, because I felt like this album
   was going to go number one. I felt like it was going to be the
   highest-charting album in my career. I felt like everything that’s
   happening; I felt that it would happen and deep down I was going
   through a lot. That’s why I wanted to make it So Much Fun, because I
   wanted to really fall back on this and be like, ‘Damn, this is really
   [how I] overcome oppression and struggle.'”

   After a half-decade of industry and media-led prognostication, Thug’s
   market heights finally match his outsized influence. In conversation,
   the Atlanta wunderkind dissolves all preconceived notions that have
   built up over the years about the formerly reclusive star. The central
   narrative of Thug’s career was one of inflexibility — of interviews
   avoided, rollouts botched, unending leaks, projects seemingly abandoned
   — but now, at least over the phone, he radiates a calm energy. Thug
   knows he’s built a career on his inscrutable nature, but his evolution
   leading a new generation of stars (Gunna, Lil Keed) on his YSL Records
   and having conversations with the likes of Jay-Z make the future clear,
   at least to him. Someone needs to be the new Tupac.

   If projections hold true, So Much Fun, will be your highest first sales
   week. Does commercial success like that matter to you?
   No, it don’t really matter to me, because it’s a sport. It’s not
   numbers to me, but it matters, the growth. I just want people to know
   that there’s a such thing as growing. There’s a such thing as faith,
   have faith in me. That’s the only reason why I care about the numbers
   at this point. Other than that I don’t really care about numbers,
   because I’ve seen artists sell a million records in a week and can’t
   sell out a show. They sell out 5,000 tickets, but you sold a million
   copies in one week. I’ve seen artists sell 10,000 copies, and then your
   tour sell out as soon as you put it on the market. I don’t really care
   for that. The only reason why I care for it this time is because I want
   people to see the growth and [have] faith in me.

   Emotionally or mentally, where were you at during the creation of this
   album?
   I’ve always had faith. So it wasn’t nothing that I was going through
   that I didn’t have faith or didn’t think could be done or happen. It
   was more about faith and perfect timing with me. I feel like it was the
   perfect time to put it out. My headspace was perfect. I always had a
   perfect headspace when it came to music even if my money was low, even
   if I had problems at home or even if I had problems in the real world
   or even if I had doubters or even if I had open cases or judgmental
   people. I never ever cracked under pressure on those types of things. I
   always kept a balance, and I was able to overcome any type of obstacle.

   Did J. Cole really executive produce the album?
   You guys have to ask him that. We have non-disclosures. We have forms
   we have to sign. He’s kind of like a prince at this point. It’s like,
   if anything comes out about him, he would like for him to put it out.

   There have been a lot more videos, interviews, and high-profile
   features for you this year. What inspired you to do be more open with
   your fans and with press?
   The fact that I never let people in and I always stayed tight when it
   came to that, because of critics. You know just simple things. Things
   that wouldn’t tear me down, but things that would tear people around me
   down, those sorts of things.

   For much of 2018, it felt like you were investing in YSL and all the
   artists that you have on that label. How does being a label boss differ
   from your individual career?
   My career is more about me, more about my label, sitting down having
   meetings discussing my business, my life, my whereabouts, my
   where-beings, and the label is nothing about me. It’s all about other
   people.

   How does it feel seeing Lil Keed and Gunna becoming stars in their own
   right?
   I feel naturally happy about it. I think I always knew the ground that
   those guys could shake-up. It wasn’t much of a surprise with me as it
   was with you guys and critics and fans. It wasn’t such a surprise for
   me, because I’ve always believed Gunna, Keed, and Lil Baby to be exact
   all of those these like my lil’ brothers. I done gave all them the game
   from my standpoint.

   What was it like collaborating with a Lil Baby or Gunna on this album?
   You sound rejuvenated. It seems like a different Thug when you’re on a
   track with them.
   Just those guys being who they are and coming up in the game and being
   able to take care of family and do things that I’ve been able to do for
   the past 10 years, it just gives me a different type of boost. Then me
   knowing that I was one of the reasons that they’re where they are. You
   know, on a very humble scale, I was one of the reasons not physically,
   but mentally. I was a real mentor for these guys lives to keep them on
   the path that they’re on. Don’t spend money. Don’t do this. Don’t make
   the mistakes I’ve [made]. It makes me so happy.

   These guys are making a way for themselves, and I really wanted this.
   It’s not nothing that just had to happen. It’s not like “Lil Baby ‘bout
   to blow up so you got to gottdamn ride his coattails.” It’s like nah,
   Lil Baby was my little brother. I was giving Lil Baby 20,000, 50,000
   dollars. Me and him just swapping money with each other before he start
   rapping. It wasn’t about an image. It was more about real love and
   purity, structure. That’s what keeps me boosted is seeing those guys be
   able to do what I’ve been doing and keeping it up and not falling off.

   Do you still enjoy being a rapper or does the life of being a celebrity
   ever get to you?
   I prayed for it my whole life. So I don’t think I ever be over it. I
   enjoy it every single day. I enjoy taking pictures. I enjoy people
   asking for pictures even the days I don’t take pictures I still enjoy
   people asking me. If I don’t take pictures I be like, “No, I don’t like
   taking pictures, but thank you so much.” I can’t ever get tired of it.
   I hear other artists saying they get tired and it’s draining. I don’t
   understand. Maybe they didn’t have the dream I had. I always dreamed
   for these things. So I don’t think I can ever get tired of it, because
   I really prayed for it.

   What will separate Punk from So Much Fun?
   So Much Fun is like nothing to be thought about. It’s only for fun
   purposes. The name of the album is directly what it means. There’s no
   static to it. It’s just so much fun. I don’t even want you to think
   when you listen to this even if I’m saying a metaphorical bars or
   anything. I don’t want it to be nothing thought too hard about. I want
   it to be only party. If you’re not partying, if it’s not Friday you
   just got your paycheck you in the car with your friends, if you not in
   the club drunk, if you not just having fun doing whatever you feel
   like, don’t play this album.

   The difference from that and Punk is Punk is me letting them in on my
   real life. Me letting them know all the situations I’ve been through.
   Opening up, letting the fans in, I feel like I never let ‘em. I feel
   like I was always quite about certain things, because of people.

   With people starting to rank the best albums of the decade, personally
   which of your albums do you think is your best or favorite?
   I would like to say Punk is, even though it’s not out. My best album
   would probably be Punk, because it’s more like real life. It’s more
   like Tupac. Tupac could be one of the biggest rappers in the world,
   because he rapped what he rapped about. I had conversations with Jay-Z
   and he told me, ‘We gotta learn how to continue what Pac had going. Pac
   was a teacher. Pac teaches.’ This album Punk that I’m going to put out
   soon is probably going to be the best album, because it really teaches
   you, gives you life situations, it’s teaching I’m human. I am you. I am
   him. It’s very verbal. I think it’ll probably be the best album even
   though it’s not out.

   What inspired you and Future to include Lil Baby and Gunna on Super
   Slimey 2?
   The impact that Lil Baby [and Gunna had] when they dropped theirs
   [project]. We always compared it like “Damn, there’s no such thing as a
   better duo, except those guys.” Then these like our little brothers,
   for real. Future really dropped knowledge on these guys. We dropped
   knowledge on each other. Sometimes they drop knowledge on us to now. We
   dropped knowledge on these guys and we feel like it’s just the right
   thing to do. Anything other than that is unacceptable. Like saying that
   there’s not a better duo or anything than Gunna and Baby was. So I feel
   like we needed to combine those two, Super Slimey 2.

   What do you personally think is the biggest misconception people still
   have about you?
   Who I am. I’m still misunderstood.

   Do you think people will ever understand who you are?
   People still misunderstood. You know I’m going to put this album out
   Punk, and it’s going to let them know a little about my life, let them
   know a little bit about life itself. I don’t think I want to make them
   to understand. I like to say that I’m misunderstood. It keeps it tense.
   It keeps it perfect.

2020 Candidate Andrew Yang Takes a Stand Against … Circumcision

   One of the strangest campaigns in the crowded Democratic primary field
   just got a little stranger

   Andrew Yang, a candidate in the Democratic primaries for president,
   speaks at a town hall meeting sponsored by the Euclid chapter of the
   NAACP at Christ Lutheran Church in ClevelandElection 2020 Yang,
   Cleveland, USA - 24 Feb 2019

   Phil Long/AP/REX/Shutterstock

   A few months ago, Andrew Yang was the longest of long shots to land the
   Democratic nomination. Now, he’s polling as a fringe contender, thanks
   in part to some outside-the-box policy proposals that have gained
   traction in certain corners of the Internet. In a recent interview with
   the Daily Beast, Yang became the first, and likely only, 2020 candidate
   to take a stand against circumcision. “I’m highly aligned with the
   intactivists,” he said. “History will prove them even more correct.”

   Not only does Yang, 44, align himself with intactivists, a name for
   those who oppose circumcision, he wants to incorporate the position
   into public policy. “From what I’ve seen, the evidence on it being a
   positive health choice for the infant is quite shaky,” added Yang, who
   has no plans to ban circumcision, only to “inform parents that it is
   entirely up to them whether their infant gets circumcised, and that
   there are costs and benefits either way.”

     Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang comes out against circumcision,
     says "Intactivist" will be part of his political coalition.

     — Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 19, 2019

   “The more choice we give parents, and the more we diminish the possible
   preconceptions or misinformation various parents are receiving, then
   the better off we’ll be as a society,” he said.

   Circumcision has been found to reduce the risk of urinary tract
   infections in infants and sexually transmitted diseases in men. The
   practice has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and
   recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But UTIs
   in infants are rare and treatable, and intactivists believe there are
   better ways to reduce the risk of STDs than performing surgery on an
   infant’s genitals. “I think there’s nothing more inhumane than tying
   down a baby or a child and amputating a healthy, normal part of his
   body,” Intact America founder Georganne Chapin told the Daily Beast,
   adding that she thinks Yang’s campaign slogan, “Humanity First,” is
   “awesome.”

   On Tuesday morning, Yang offered parents an additional piece of advice.

     Would Zion Williamson be so epic if his name were Charles? Parents
     take note.

     — Andrew Yang (@AndrewYangVFA) March 19, 2019

   Yang’s candidacy initially drew attention because of his proposal to
   institute a universal basic income — or “Freedom Dividend” — of $1,000
   per month, largely in an effort to offset the effects of the job loss
   that will result from automation. “If you’re dealing with an economic
   shift this historic, then you need to bring real solutions to bear that
   are going to help people manage the transition,” he told Rolling Stone
   in January. “And the most efficient way to do that is a universal basic
   income.”

   A month after speaking with Rolling Stone, Yang appeared on the popular
   Joe Rogan Experience podcast. He started to develop a cult following.
   “Everything is up and to the right since the Joe Rogan podcast,”
   campaign manager Zach Graumann told the Daily Beast earlier this month.
   “That was the key. That was the moment.”

   Yang’s unexpected rise was nurtured in corners of the Internet like
   Reddit and 4chan, and often with the help of the #MAGA sect, which took
   to Yang’s proposal to give every American adult $1,000 per month, no
   strings attached. Memes abounded. The #YangGang was born.

     Did Trump just lose the 2020 meme war? Memers flock to
     @andrewYangVFA's campaign centered around AI mass job loss requiring
     universal basic income (UBI) after mentions on @JoeRogan and
     @WikiLeaks. See #Yanggang and #yanggang2020 for thousands of
     examples. pic.twitter.com/n7vxeMN4l2

     — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 8, 2019

   According to a report from Axios published Tuesday morning, Yang has
   received more mentions on 4chan and 8chan than any other Democratic
   candidate. But as his candidacy has taken root in far-right hotbeds,
   it’s unclear how much of the support is sincere, and how much is part
   of a tongue-in-cheek effort to introduce chaos into the Democratic
   primary and elevate a candidate users believe will increase President
   Trump’s chances of winning in 2020.

   Regardless, Yang’s heightened profile has yielded more than a few
   memes. Last week, his campaign announced it had received contributions
   from 65,000 unique donors, the threshold necessary to qualify for the
   first two Democratic debates. Shortly before making the announcement,
   Yang tweeted that he believed one his donors was Nicolas Cage. Cage’s
   manager later confirmed to Rolling Stone that the actor did indeed
   donate to Yang’s campaign and that he supports his candidacy.

   Again, this is a strange campaign.

Inside Carlos Santana’s New Jazz-Rock Supergroup

   No matter who you are or what skills you bring to the table, starting a
   new band with keyboardist Herbie Hancock and saxophonist Wayne Shorter,
   two of the jazz world’s most iconic luminaries, is serious business.
   Not so serious, though, that Carlos Santana, a legend in his own right,
   hesitates to crack wise about the origin of Mega Nova, the jazz-rock
   supergroup he’s formed with Hancock, Shorter and two more heavyweight
   players: bassist Marcus Miller and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana, the
   guitarist’s wife.

   “I asked them if it was OK for me to start a rumor that we were going
   to do something together, and they said, ‘Of course,'” Santana tells
   Rolling Stone, laughing. “So I started a rumor, and here we are. And I
   feel so excited, because with these musicians, anything and everything
   can be transmitted.”

   The new band, Mega Nova – named in tribute to Shorter’s 1969 solo album
   Super Nova – will make its debut in a one-off concert at the Hollywood
   Bowl on August 24th. It’s not the first time these players have met
   onstage; most of the band members have played together on various
   occasions, and Santana and Shorter toured together in 1988. Shorter and
   Hancock collaborated with Santana in a program called “Hymns for Peace”
   at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2004, and Miller and Blackman Santana
   were among the supporting musicians that joined the core triumvirate
   for a Hancock-led event, “Celebrating Peace,” at the Hollywood Bowl in
   2012.

   “Carlos is a big jazz fan, a big supporter of the music,” Hancock tells
   RS. “With his heart, he honors jazz. But it’s not just words; it’s also
   his deeds. This is the kind of action that he’s taken to include jazz,
   because he has so much respect for it, and he respects Wayne and me –
   as we respect him: as a musician, as a storyteller in music. Nobody can
   deliver a melody like Carlos.”

   The admiration is mutual, emphatically so. “For me, this is a real
   blessing,” Santana says, “to dream of something, and then to see it
   come to fruition.” To be in the company of Shorter and Hancock – whose
   work with trumpeter and bandleader Miles Davis in the mid-1960s
   launched trailblazing careers in jazz, fusion and pop, individually and
   in collaboration – is a lesson in humility, as Santana describes it.

   How does Santana find common ground with his illustrious comrades? “It
   starts with surrender,” he says without hesitation. “I immediately
   defer to both of them, and I wait my turn to see when they invite me to
   come up with something. I’m very honored and grateful that they trust
   me. So for me, it’s about learning to defer – I learned that word from
   Magic Johnson, when he said he deferred to [Kareem] Abdul-Jabbar. It
   means you have the courtesy to honor those who came before you.”

   Respect also animates Blackman Santana’s approach to Mega Nova –
   specifically, her admiration for Tony Williams, the trailblazing
   drummer who worked in Davis’ band with Hancock and Shorter, and for
   Jack DeJohnette, the protean percussionist who played on Davis sessions
   as well as Shorter’s Super Nova.

   “Tony is to me unparalleled in his sound concept, the amount of things
   he innovated on and with,” she tells RS. “From tuning my drums to
   concepts of playing inside the music, taking drum solos, composition –
   he’s influenced me in every way.” DeJohnette, she notes, started as a
   pianist, “so he approaches [drumming] in a very musical way. He’s got a
   lot of good energy, a lot of good fire. And he puts together really
   good projects.”

   Blackman Santana, a noted bandleader and composer who has collaborated
   with such heavyweights as Lenny Kravitz, Cream’s Jack Bruce and Living
   Colour’s Vernon Reid, holds Hancock and Shorter in special esteem. “Not
   only is it a pleasure and an honor to play with them, but it’s also a
   challenge to step up to them,” she says. “If I can somehow make those
   cats feel inspired, I’ll feel like I’ve reached the mountaintop.”

   But as Shorter sees it, Mega Nova has to provide optimal conditions for
   Blackman Santana, as well. “She needs to be free from any kind of rigid
   arrangements,” he tells RS. Shorter cites two performances of “The
   Star-Spangled Banner” that Santana and Blackman Santana played before
   NBA Finals games in 2015 and 2016. “They were respectful,” he says,
   “but Cindy had carte blanche. She was playing riffs and rises” –
   Shorter reels off rhythms and rolls vocally, illustrating Blackman
   Santana’s unbridled free playing.

   That boundless exuberance is consistent with what Shorter set out to
   express on Super Nova, the first album he recorded after leaving Miles
   Davis’ band. “When you’re going fishing, you want to throw the line out
   as far as you can,” he says. “I was throwing the music at a distance,
   where it would challenge me, and also sharing the challenge – like when
   you’re kids playing, maybe in a vacant lot, and you play all day and
   you’d discover stuff. It’s like, what are you going to do after you
   leave Miles Davis? So, Super Nova: You’re on your own, you’re an
   astronaut – let’s jump out into space.”

     “The whole concept of building something together: That’s what this
     is about.” –Herbie Hancock

   Even so, every astronaut knows careful planning and a safety tether are
   crucial to success and survival. “The best improvisation has a solid
   base,” says Miller, a celebrated bassist known for his work with Luther
   Vandross and with Miles Davis in the 1980s. He recounts something the
   great arranger and producer Quincy Jones once told him: “The biggest
   hindrance to creativity is a blank page.” Impose a few parameters, he
   recalls Jones saying, and creativity flowers instantly.

   “When you’re an improviser, it’s a really ethereal kind of thing,
   because you’re not really sure what you’re going to do when you go
   onstage,” Miller tells RS. “This is kind of a freaky feeling, to be
   standing there with 7,000 people waiting for us, and we don’t really
   know exactly what it is that’s going to happen out there. Imagine that
   feeling – it’s a huge leap of faith.”

   Both Santana and Hancock view that collaborative uncertainty as an
   accurate reflection of Mega Nova’s design and ideals. “We have hearts
   that are very compatible in the way we look at the world, the way we
   look at humanity, and our responsibility as human beings, as musicians,
   as storytellers from the cultural community,” Hancock says. The
   inevitability and necessity of globalization, he notes, is a key
   concern.

   “We have the capacity for creating a world that we can all believe in,
   one that we can look forward to for ourselves and our children,”
   Hancock says. “What we want to do is make a step toward bringing
   cultures and ethnicities and people in general together, and show the
   value of collaboration from the standpoint of respect. The whole
   concept of building something together: That’s what this is about.”

   Santana is even more pointed about the objective. “I want to be able to
   travel with this band eventually, and be the peace ambassadors, which
   is what Louis Armstrong used to be, and what I would say Bob Marley or
   John Lennon represented,” he says. “Let me say really clearly: Wayne
   and Herbie and I and Cindy and Marcus, we are the frequency to do the
   opposite of Donald Trump. We don’t see walls – we saw the Berlin Wall
   come down. We’ve been to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we saw what that
   stuff is. We play music to bring, once and for all, inclusiveness and
   family. This is the band.”

   New Order

   New Order are currently recording tracks for their 10th studio album.

   Buda Mendes/Getty

   When New Order went on tour this past summer — three years after
   reporting that they were done for good — the band played a single new
   track amid a set heavy on classic hits. The band had worked on the
   song, titled “Plastic,” between the gigs that were supposed to be their
   last; and now it will appear on their 10th studio LP. “The shows were
   being well-received and we were enjoying it,” singer-guitarist Bernard
   Sumner, 59, tells Rolling Stone. “It seemed like the logical thing to
   do.”

   Drummer Stephen Morris says that new material “has been small steps
   coming since 2011,” but this past December he and his bandmates started
   moving faster, recording for the first time since bassist Peter Hook
   left the band in 2007. The current lineup welcomes back Gillian
   Gilbert, the keyboardist who last played on 2001’s Get Ready, and adds
   Bad Lieutenant members Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. Sumner says
   that the new configuration has made the band more flexible, allowing
   different members to move across guitars, keys and backing vocals. “The
   lines have gotten a bit blurrier than they used to be,” he says. “We’ve
   become songwriters instead of instrumentalists.”

   why

   Still, recording has become less glamorous since the days when the band
   hung out at Manchester’s Haçienda nightclub and producer Arthur Baker
   rushed their “Confusion” reel-to-reel straight to the DJ booth at New
   York’s Funhouse. “We used to just play for hours jamming in the studio
   and then find a bit — a second — that wasn’t bad,” says Morris. “And
   then find another second that could go on top of that. Now we’ve become
   a bit more professional in recording, for better or for worse. We’re
   streamlined.”

   He and Gilbert — the couple married in 1994 — have spent the last
   decade raising their family on a farm outside of Manchester, and the
   band that brought the couple together has once again occupied their
   home. “Me and Gillian have long conversations about music all the time
   when we should be doing other stuff,” says Morris, whose daughter Tilly
   plays keys in a group called Hot Vestry. “It’s like, blimey, we did it
   again! Once we watched a box set of Breaking Bad, and we shut up while
   doing that. We’re just waiting for another one to divert us from going
   on and on about New Order.”

   Over in London, Sumner’s creative process is a little more insular.
   “It’s rainy and cold and wet outside,” he says. “It’s dark. It’s a good
   time to write.”

   Morris laughs knowingly when he hears this. “That explains a lot of the
   band’s content, doesn’t it?” he asks. “Bernard likes to be alone while
   writing – alone with his wine.”

   The band has thus far completed two tracks: “Plastic” and “Restless,”
   which features Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands. Morris says that the
   record will keep true to New Order’s sound while taking advantage of
   newer drum and synth programming technology, adding that he thinks
   “production is going in reverse now.”

   “A lot of people have started using old analog stuff even though it has
   no memory,” he explains. “I fool around with modular synths because you
   create a sound by accident. There’s a lot of noise, and then you’d stop
   and see something great. There’s something spontaneous about it. You
   don’t really get that anymore.”

   Morris’ nostalgia is particularly endearing given his band’s
   overwhelming influence on the last 15 years of electro and dance-punk.
   With equal passion he praises the krautrock drums of Neu! and Can and
   the younger generation that has taken New Order’s innovations into the
   new millenium. “I absolutely love James Murphy and DFA,” says Morris.
   “We toured with Holy Ghost!, which was fantastic. Everything they do is
   incredible: It’s what we were doing years ago only they’re doing it for
   now.”

   Adds Sumner: “I don’t think you can say that anyone is doing what New
   Order does but musicians are all influenced by their record
   collections. Our earliest influences were Bowie and Iggy Pop and
   Kraftwerk and songwriters like Neil Young before that. Instead of
   changing things in a negative way, [the bands influenced by New Order]
   are giving it new life.”

   Appropriately, the band will be releasing this LP — hopefully sometime
   in Autumn — on Mute, home to a roster of synth-loving electronic
   artists including Zola Jesus, Arca and Depeche Mode. Founder Daniel
   Miller acts as the band’s informal soundboard. “I don’t think we’d ever
   finish if we didn’t have someone to tell us to stop,” says Morris.
   “It’s hard to let something you’re working on go.” When the record
   comes out, Sumner says that fans should expect a heavy electronic sound
   with melodic guitars and “an orchestral feel.”

   “Some people may say that electronic music is cold and unromantic,”
   Sumner says, referencing their hit “Blue Monday” as a example of how a
   song can be both robotic and emphatic. “That’s true in a way, but now a
   computer is able to translate exactly what your brain is thinking.
   That’s exciting. It’s what we were trying to achieve in the 1980s.”

Boston Cannabis Week: Photos

   <p>“I’m blessed to be here, as a Black woman entrepreneur who just
   started her business in February. It’s hard and you’re constantly
   taking in a lot of people’s energy…you also need to practice self-care.
   There’s this mindset that it’s better to work for yourself and make
   your own money but you have to pay your rent — so you have to do all of
   these other jobs to survive. It’s hard but it’s an amazing journey and
   I will never, ever quit.”</p> <p>“Our lab is based out of Framingham.
   We test for anyone who’s interested in finding out more about their
   cannabis products of adult age in Massachusetts. If you’re a home
   grower or you’re making edibles, we can tell you more information about
   the potency, certify the safety, the purity of the products that are
   being made and consumed. From a personal standpoint, I’ve experienced
   the benefits of cannabis both recreationally and medically. I’m a
   diabetic and it helps to modulate blood glucose amongst other things.
   While Massachusetts has taken the lead to be the first state to take
   these initiatives, there’s a long way to go when it comes to
   actualizing the vision.”</p> <p>“We are a women founded nonprofit
   designed to improve diversity and inclusion inside the cannabis
   industry through education, networking and events. As we’re building
   regulations as it pertains to cannabis, there are certain conversations
   that need to be had to make sure that they are fair, structured and
   helpful. Realistically, the drug war was most harmful to communities of
   color. We need to make a very concerted effort to encourage those
   particular populations to take leadership roles and become business
   owners so we can not only improve diversity, but to give back after the
   damage that was done.” – Cara Brabb Burnham, cofounder, ELEVATE
   Northeast </p>

Masked Country Star Orville Peck Kicks Off North American Tour

   <p>Signed to Nirvana’s old record label and partially hidden beneath a
   fringed leather mark, Orville Peck is an unusual country cowboy — the
   sort of deep-voiced singer whose music evokes the surrealism of David
   Lynch as much as the baritoned boom of Johnny Cash. We caught up with
   him at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on September 20, 2019 for the
   beginning of his North American Tour.</p> <p>Orville Peck at the Music

Boston Cannabis Week: Photos

   <p>“I’m blessed to be here, as a Black woman entrepreneur who just
   started her business in February. It’s hard and you’re constantly
   taking in a lot of people’s energy…you also need to practice self-care.
   There’s this mindset that it’s better to work for yourself and make
   your own money but you have to pay your rent — so you have to do all of
   these other jobs to survive. It’s hard but it’s an amazing journey and
   I will never, ever quit.”</p> <p>“Our lab is based out of Framingham.
   We test for anyone who’s interested in finding out more about their
   cannabis products of adult age in Massachusetts. If you’re a home
   grower or you’re making edibles, we can tell you more information about
   the potency, certify the safety, the purity of the products that are
   being made and consumed. From a personal standpoint, I’ve experienced
   the benefits of cannabis both recreationally and medically. I’m a
   diabetic and it helps to modulate blood glucose amongst other things.
   While Massachusetts has taken the lead to be the first state to take
   these initiatives, there’s a long way to go when it comes to
   actualizing the vision.”</p> <p>“We are a women founded nonprofit
   designed to improve diversity and inclusion inside the cannabis
   industry through education, networking and events. As we’re building
   regulations as it pertains to cannabis, there are certain conversations
   that need to be had to make sure that they are fair, structured and
   helpful. Realistically, the drug war was most harmful to communities of
   color. We need to make a very concerted effort to encourage those
   particular populations to take leadership roles and become business
   owners so we can not only improve diversity, but to give back after the
   damage that was done.” – Cara Brabb Burnham, cofounder, ELEVATE
   Northeast </p>

   Dove Cameron

   Dove Cameron got her start on Disney, starring in the sitcom 'Liv and
   Maddie'.

   Blythe Thomas

   Dove Cameron knows people have never been sure what to make of her. The
   23-year-old got her start on Disney, starring in the sitcom Liv and
   Maddie before helming the musical film franchise Descendants, in which
   she played Maleficent’s daughter. While she thrived on the platform,
   her life and celebrity felt separate from the entertainment engine for
   which she was working.

   “I always felt like I was an actress-for-hire rather than a brand
   ambassador or a ‘Disney kid,’” she says bluntly. When Descendants 3
   aired earlier this summer, her final appearance in the franchise, the
   feeling of something being “severed” came as a shock. “When it ended, I
   really didn’t anticipate having any sort of emotional page turn.”

   What seemed to affect her more was public perception, especially as she
   was in the midst of figuring out her next move. “A lot of people had
   more ideas about me than even I had about myself,” she says, laughing.
   Cameron admits that her own personal preferences and image never helped
   the image placed on her.

   “I happen to look quite clean, and I happen to not be interested in
   things that we would typically call ‘inappropriate,’ like things that
   might be bad for the brand,” she explains, referring to the impulse by
   past Disney stars to be rebellious. “I just happened to be one of those
   people that wasn’t naturally inclined to behave like that.”

   As she came close to the end of her time with the company, Cameron
   realized she craved creativity, something that made her feel more like
   a participant, more than a watcher within the industry. So, after
   signing with Disruptor/Columbia Records, she explored other options and
   began working in the studio with seasoned writers and producers like
   the Orphanage, Jonas Jeberg, Delacey, Carly Paige Waldrip, and Chloe
   Angelides. Together, they cooked up a “pretty meaty collection” of
   songs she’s beginning to release. Dreamy, rock-tinged love song “Waste”
   and the darker, synthy break-up opus “Bloodshot” — both released last
   week — are the long-awaited taste of the new Dove Cameron, the real
   Dove Cameron.

   “I do get the sense that I can feel a little bit far away from even my
   fans I have now, and I don’t know if that’s because of a highly glossy
   image,” she says. “I do think this music opens up more of who I really
   am.”

   For both, Cameron wanted to approach stereotypical coming-of-age
   feelings from fresh angles. On “Waste,” a song she describes as one of
   her absolute favorites, she wanted to step away from the “melty,
   dripping, sappy love songs” she tends to loathe.

   “It’s more about the dire effects that happen to you when you’re
   massively in love with someone all of a sudden,” she explains further,
   “and the chemicals that get released and the feeling of suffering
   something so delicious.”

   On the opposite end, “Bloodshot” was originally inspired by some boy
   problems Cameron’s co-writer Waldrip had been experiencing, but the
   goal was to keep the actual meaning more open-ended.

   “I tend to really hate a break-up song,” she admits. “It’s more about
   the feeling of losing someone. It could be about a death or a
   friendship loss.”

   nfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   For the time being, Cameron is shifting her entire focus to music. A
   third new song may arrive soon, she explains, and she plans on filming
   proper videos for each single. To help aid that plan, she’s avoiding
   the commitment of any television series; following her appearances in
   the off-Broadway adaptation Clueless: The Musical and a London
   production of The Light in the Piazza, she’s steering clear of her
   accidental detour into musical theater. Hopefully, the next time she
   will be on stage, she’ll be performing her original songs.

   “I feel all of a sudden like I’ve come down to reality,” Cameron
   concludes. “I feel more grounded and human than ever.”
