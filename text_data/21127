     * By taking what students are already familiar with (the media), this
       (workshop) helps them to think critically. This workshop offers a
       plethora of resources for application in the classroom.
       Screen Education: Engaging 21st Century Digital Natives In Media
       Literacy Education ABC Project, Columbia SC, September 12, 2013
     * Your sessions, both with students and teachers, have been some of
       the most valuable, relevant, engaging activities and training that
        I have been a part of in my 17 years in education. Teaching our
       students to think critically and be “healthy skeptics” are lifelong
       skills that they need, and tapping into the media that is so much a
       part of their world is an amazing way to grab their attention and
       engage them in authentic ways. Just AWESOME.
       Understanding Media Messages Karen Bush, Principal, Inman
       Intermediate School, Inman SC, December 2, 2013
     * This (media) literacy is essential for our day and era since so
       much of our world consists of visual images. Frank provided a cache
       of information to be used in the classroom....priceless!
       Critical Thinking & Media Literacy Writing Improvement Network, SC
       State Museum, Columbia SC, September 24, 2013
     * Media literacy is a concept that is not given adequate attention in
       our schools. Students would benefit from classes that directly
       focus on these techniques.
       Creating Opportunities to Engage Students in A 21st Century World
       Spartanburg 1, Chapman HS, December 3, 2013
     * Media literacy is so critical as a 21st century skill because it
       puts the power of persuasion into the hands of our future leaders.
       Students must learn to analyze media and recognize point of view so
       they can be literate consumers and producers of content.
       Analyzing and Understanding Media as a 21st Century Common Core
       Skill Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Pickford Center,
       Hollywood, CA, January 8, 2014
     * Media literacy challenges students to further analysis skills that
       can overflow into their reading ability. The presentation and
       information gave backing to using certain media in the classroom.
       Thinking About Media in a 21st Century Common Core World Berkeley
       County Teacher Forum, Cane Bay, SC, Summerville SC, February 14,
       2014
     * Media is everywhere and needs to be an integral component of ELA
       classrooms in instructional strategies of the classroom in 21st
       century education. Media literacy is critical for our students to
       objectively analyze and process the mass of media information in
       this world.
       Close Reading of Media Texts Berkeley County Teacher Forum, Cane
       Bay, SC, Summerville SC, February 14, 2014
     * Media literacy is necessary if our students are to become
       thoughtful/reflective media consumers. Splendid introduction to the
       topic. I'm excited about trying Frank's suggestions in my fifth
       grade class. I think my students will be excited.
       Close Reading of Media Texts SCIRA Conference, Myrtle Beach SC,
