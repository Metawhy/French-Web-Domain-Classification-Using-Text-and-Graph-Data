   In Memoriam: Ben “bushing” Byer
   image

   We are deeply saddened by the news that our member, colleague, and
   friend Ben “bushing” Byer passed away of natural causes on Monday,
   February 8th.

   Many of you knew him as one of the public faces of the iPhone Dev Team,
   Team Twiizers and fail0verflow.

   Outspoken but never confrontational, he was proof that even in the
   competitive and oftentimes aggressive hacking scene, there is a place
   for both a sharp mind and a kind heart.

   To us he was, of course, much more. He brought us together, as a group
   and in spirit. Without him, we as a team would not exist. He was a
   mentor to many, and an inspiration to us all.

   Yet above anything, he was our friend. He will be dearly missed.

   Our thoughts go out to his wife and family.

   Keep hacking. It’s what bushing would have wanted.
