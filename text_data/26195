Room Tour 2019-2020

   7/31/2019

   0 Comments

   Last year's room tour. This year was so much easier because I am not
   moving art rooms! I'm simplifying a few things and improving
   organization overall but not much is changing!
   I dyed all of the fabric on my bulletin boards and desk using the
   shibori method and it is still looking good so I decided to leave it
   up. I used liquid starch to 'adhere' it to the front of my metal desk
   and staples to affix it to the cork boards.

   I decided to make a supply station to hold my supplies and this is a
   little more centralized and not directly under the portfolio shelves so
   I think it will work out a lot better. I added nails on the side of the
   bookshelf to hold the rulers, protractors and some circle templates and
   I tired to put all of the 'art 1 supplies on one side.
   Picture
   I love the size of my room. I have a class that is split with half
   students in advanced 2D design and half in 3D design (with a few in AP
   classes). The size of the space allows me to have some working on
   wheels or hand building while others are in more focused
   drawing/painting activities. I changed the layout from 4-desk tables to
   3-desk groupings facing the front. I hope this will be a welcome
   change.
   Picture
   The rug in this book corner is from World Market, it is for patios so I
   think it will take a lot of wear and tear.
   Picture
   View from the back of the room looking towards my desk. I love having a
   T.V. to use for displaying announcements, showing videos and
   slideshows.
   Picture
   Picture
    I decided to add lighting under these cabinets. I found some on amazon
   and the wire shelves are from Home Depot. I wanted to make this space a
   little more user friendly for hot-glue guns, wood burners and chrome
   books, so I added the power strips with velcro tape.
   Bought these. Ended up not liking the motion sensor and had them
   re-wired to not use the motion sensor, plugged them into a switch that
   I can command with a remote.
   Picture
   Picture
   The wire shelf with cleaning supplies is new this year! The mirror I
   made mid year from a mirror sent to me from Wayfair....it arrived
   broken so I used the shards to make a mosaic to look like a mirror from
   the Jungalow.
   Picture
   I decided to be more consistent with cell phone rules this year so I
   made a 'jail' charging station so that the phones have a safe place to
   go if they are becoming a distraction....I added a couple of chargers,
   but plenty of spots for multiple students to charge them at once. Link
   to pocket chart. Link to power strip.
   Picture
   Here is a view of my cabinets without lighting and before the wire
   shelving was installed.
   Picture
   I don't think everything will ever be 100% organized but its fun to
   make it better each year. Thanks for reading!
   I'm also including my amazon wish list, in case you want to se what I
   did not buy this year but I would like to have for the room in the
   future.

Educators ArtLab

   7/15/2019

   0 Comments

   Picture
   TThe last week of June, I was selected to participate in the Educators
   ArtLab at the Kansas City Art Institute. To get into the program, I had
   to submit a digital portfolio of my work and my student's work. There
   were 3 options for 'Major Studio': painting, product design and
   photography. I am so glad that I was chosen to participate in the
   Painting Major Studio. I was one of 11 other teachers from around the
   country and we worked with the amazing professor Jonah Criswell.
   Going in, I really did not know what to expect. We had a supply list to
   bring with us, but I didn't know anyone else who would be part of the
   program so I was excited to make friends with some new art teachers. I
   did not realize that they would be from so many far away places...I
   thought many would be from Missouri, but there were only three or four
   other Missouri teachers in the entire program. I was taking the
   residency as a class and paid a little extra to get 2 graduate level
   studio art credits.
   We stayed in the residence hall and ate mostly in the student cafeteria
   for meals. The first thing we did when we got to campus and were
   settled in, was to take a tour. Many famous artists have attended the
   Art Institute including Nick Cave and Walt Disney. We got to see many
   of the art studios and facilities on campus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture
   The first night, they treated us to a wonderful meal in the restaurant
   of the Kemper Museum. The meal was good, and it gave us a chance to
   break the ice and start talking to other teachers and find out where
   they were from. At my table, there were teachers from Ohio, Colorado,
   Oklahoma, and Texas.
   Picture
   That night, a few of us took a walk over to the Nelson-Atkins just to
   check it out.
   Picture
   Picture
   The next day we started our first class on campus. The 11 of us
   painters went to the painting building, while the product design people
   were in the lab designing stuff to be 3D printed and the photographers
   were planning their photo series for the week. The photography and
   product design groups were a little smaller. I heard that painting was
   the largest group because so many people want to do the painting class,
   but it is hard to get into. In fact, there were a couple people in the
   other studios that really wanted to be in painting but did not get in.
   I felt proud that I had been selected.
   That morning, Jonah did a demo on how to get started painting from a
   live model. He went over how to set up our palette with warm/cool
   colors and how to look at the lighting in the mostly white room. He
   learned our names quickly and I was very impressed by how funny and
   engaging he was as an instructor.
   When you take a class like this, it is always funny because you think
   that you know a lot about art, until you hear someone else explain it
   better...and then you realize that you don't know anything and you
   start to doubt yourself and try to hold in all of the information as
   much as you can. The new input wants to burst out as quickly as it goes
   in, I wanted to write down every nugget of information so that it would
   stick in my brain.
   Picture
   Picture
   After working from the model in two poses, I've never went straight
   into painting from a model, with no time do sketch things out, and
   mixing colors on the fly because she will only be in the pose for 45
   minutes to an hour, you have to work so fast. Our assignment after the
   model finished was to select a part of our painting and blow it up
   bigger, to create an abstraction.
   We had lunch and then Jonah gave a great lecture on art history. He
   talked about Abstraction, Modernity and Modernism.
   My main take away from this lecture was thinking about how atmosphere,
   zeitgeist, process and existentialism influenced the artists in the
   abstraction movement differently. Also, society was changing and people
   of the middles classes were trying to find a language to describe
   internal feelings and struggles. They borrowed terms from music to
   describe art and and color became a metaphor.
   Great quotes: "The reconstruction of society, nature, the mind and
   material construction became a frontier for thought in ways that
   previous generations were not able to entertain, due to the power and
   disposition of entrenched institutions."
   "As older institutions lost power, there was a search for newer ones,
   spirituality underwent many avant garde changes, the personal, mystic
   experience was often at the center of surrealist and abstract artists
   interest, ritual occult practices, although not popular were also en
   vogue. The independence streak of Modern people’s zeitgeist resisted
   the success of this kind of new medieval iconography but it remains an
   undercurrent, complimenting Freud through Jung."​
   Picture
   After the lecture, we were able to move our stuff into individual
   studios upstairs. Here, we could work on whatever we wanted as artists.
   We had all afternoon to work and we did! All the way until dinner.
   Jonah came around while we were working and talked to us individually
   about our work. He told me to check out some contemporary painters:
   Susan Lichtman and Eve Mansdorf.
   Tuesday was a lot like Monday with a lot of time to work from the model
   in the morning, and a lecture in the afternoon. Tuesday morning, we had
   to take a piece from someone else's artwork and repaint it, continuing
   it on abstractly to create a new image.
   My take away from the lecture was that people started to use less
   content, with the purpose of imposing a strong feeling about an image
   to invoke meaning. Many connections were made with contemporary artists
   and how they relate to the original abstract artists in the early 20th
   century. (Julie Mehretu, Dana Schutz)
   Quote from the lecture:
   "Modernism is the title given to a kind of aesthetic ideaology, or
   project that was in some ways superimposed upon the activities of many
   artists, thinkers, architects etc. Its fundamental argument is that the
   new age required a new orientation of the traditional arts to more
   sufficiently explain being and thought. Industrialization, Darwinism,
   modularity and the rise of American culture and industry (due to its
   remaining infrastructure after ww1 and ww2) allowed for this notion of
   “newness” to be deeply inspiration in midcentury American artists."
   My biggest take away from this lecture was how does it feel to be alive
   as an artist in the world right now?
   ​
   Picture
   Can I just say that when you are trying to synthesize such deep
   information, decoding what it means to you and recreating new artwork
   based on new input and new ways of looking at the world, that is some
   heavy stuff. Tonight, myself and another artist decided to skip dinner
   and keep working and then grab something later. We worked until 6:00
   and then went to a little gallery show at the H&R Block Space. After
   the gallery show, we took an Uber down to the Crossroads district. I
   took them to a couple of my favorite KC places (Extra Virgin for tapas
   and the Green Lady Lounge) and before heading back to the Art
   Institute, we walked up to the Power and Light District. We took an
   Uber back to campus.
   Picture
   Wednesday morning, I got up early but I was tired. We realized that
   this would be the last day with the model because we needed to wrap
   stuff up on Thursday to prepare for an art show on Friday. We painted a
   beautiful composition of the model in a lounge chair. I didn't really
   like any of my paintings of the model, I told Jonah that what I was
   doing in the class was just playing around but what I did upstairs was
   'business'. You can see one of my paintings from the model session
   below, along with my studio space and a photo of the painting
   building.
   Picture
   Wednesday was a tiring day. We painted from the model, and our
   assignment was to think about warm and cool reds/yellows/and blues as a
   way to create depth. Warmth of the paper can activate cools, or cool
   paper makes cools recede.
   Jonah was not afraid to paint right on our paintings to demonstrate
   something. "What is this, work for your show at the louvre," he joked.
   Jonah encouraged us to find 5 hours a week to work on our own artwork.
   He said that teachers are like Ferraris, we are always on and moving
   fast.
   Picture
   Picture
   Wednesday afternoon, we worked in our studios and after dinner,
   Jennifer and I walked to a little pub in Westport. We did not stay long
   and then we went to bed early. Thursday, I woke up early to put some
   extra time in the studio. I was in my studio by 6:00, I was the first
   one over there and I made a lot of progress on my painting.
   Thursday morning, we did not work from the model, we just worked in our
   studios. After lunch, we walked over to the Nelson-Atkins to see the 30
   Americans Show. After that, we carpooled to the West Bottoms to see
   Jonah's studio. Dinner that night was in the banquet hall on campus,
   they catered Q39 BBQ for us. After a presentation about portfolios from
   the recruiting office, we had to hang our show in the gallery.
   Picture
   Picture
   Picture
   Friday morning, we took down our work from the show and moved it into
   the painting room for our critiques. We critiqued 5 students and then
   took a break and critiqued 5 more, spending about 10-12 minutes on each
   one. Before the critiques, Jonah talked to us about critiques, how to
   use nonverbal cues, and have a written option for students.
   Jonah provided very thoughtful insight into our work and gave each of
   us very different advice. He told me: "You are a very gifted artist.
   You are running on a 6 cylindar but you don't turn it on very often.
   You need to trust your instincts with your camera, don't be afraid to
   make it uglier. You can make art that looks good, but you've done that
   before you have found yourself as an artist. You have a need to be a
   good wife, career, friend and artist at the same time, you need to make
   artwork that is like if you won the lottery/ship is going down."
   Wow, I've never had a critique like that in my life. It felt good to be
   noticed as an artist and a person and to be respected.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture
   After the critique, we had lunch at the Nelson-Atkins in their
   beautiful restaurant. We rehung our artwork for the show real quick and
   then we invited the 'public' in to see the work.
   ​Not many people came to see, but it was fun to see what the
   photography students and the product design students had been working
   on.
   Also, I won a prize for my social media use of our hashtag (you can use
   it to see more images from the week on instagram) #kcaieal #eal2019  My
   prize was geli plates!

Professional Development

   1/21/2019

   0 Comments

   Hello!
   It has been a while since I've written any new blog posts. In August, I
   started a new job at a local school district--and now I am teaching
   high school art. I still have a few middle school posts that I started
   but never finished writing so I hope to go back and publish those
   eventually, but from this point on, most of my posts will be high
   school-themed projects. YAY!
   Can I just say, I love teaching high school? I taught elementary art
   for 9 years, middle school for 4 and now I am about halfway through my
   first year of high school and it is my favorite so far. In terms of
   projects that I am interested in, kids 'getting' my personality, and
   the pace of the daily schedule, it is like night and day from
   middle/elementary. There is a little more paperwork, and I had a bit of
   a learning curve as I moved to a new district, now I am implementing
   more technology than ever and it took a little bit to get used to the
   new gradebook and all of that, but the rest is so fun.
   For this post, I want to focus on Professional Development. Every
   school district does this a little bit differently.
   During the 2018-2019 school year, I will:
     * Read Drawing on the Right side of the Brain book. I will link my
       notes after reading. Write reflective blog posts about my
       implementation of vocabulary and academic language. My goal is to
       finis the book by June 2019.
     * Attend MAEA Spring Conference April 11th-13th 2019, and will attend
       sessions specializing in vocabulary and academic language.
     * Collaborate with other art teachers in the district, PLC fine art
       team and outside the district. I am currently enrolled in a
       graduate level oil painting class which runs from August
       2018-May2019. During the course of this class, I collaborate
       frequently with cohort members comprised of practicing artists,
       local teachers and my professors.

   Today is MLK day so the kids had the day off. I spent the day in the
   art room of a local art teacher in a neighboring school district who
   was in session, making up a snow day. Man, I got so much information, I
   decided that the best way to reflect and delve into all of my ideas
   would be to draft this post, that way I can include links and photos.
   When I got to the artroom at the neighboring school, the teacher was in
   the middle of an advanced drawing class. The students were working on
   coloring with colored pencils. I was curious about her development of
   this skill and she shared some of the initial activities with me....and
   I promptly took scans and then forgot to save the scans on my notes and
   I just took a break from writing this to have a good cry....but I'm
   glad that I looked at what I actually got from her because I got a ton
   of great ideas!
   ​
   Picture
   List of ideas:
   Use www.sketchforschools.com to create custom sketchbooks for classes.
   First page includes a place for student's name, 2nd page is the course
   syllabus, pages 4-10 have examples of elements and principles. Page 11
   has instructions on how to write an artist statement, page 12 has self
   reflection/rubric for artwork, pages 13-20 have weekly sketch prompts
   with an art style for inspiration. Wow, I cannot wait to design my own
   book!! After the first 20-30 pages, the rest of the book is #60 weight
   drawing paper for sketching and prompts.
   Supply bags. Using bigger than gallon-size bags, supply bags have the
   following: glue stick, drawing pencils, kneaded eraser, tortillions,
   sharpies and other supplies that kids have added.
   Use 'imagination at work' handout at the beginning of the year to check
   for creativity. (got a copy) This is also used in gifted testing.
   Final exam sample. In drawing, students were charged with combining a
   drooling dragon, an eccentric elephant and a maniac mouse into a single
   composition. The drawing should take the entire 90 minutes.
   Perspective: demo 2 point and 1 point; give students a small example to
   use as a guide for their own name (tailor the activity to each students
   ability). Some get to do 1 point, while others are encouraged to do 2
   point.
   3-D class ideas: cardboard cube. Use x-acto to cut square pieces, tear
   away the cardboard to reveal the corrugation. Use a different design on
   each side, assemble into a cube.
   ​Spirit animal quiz for a spirit animal mandala or other spirit animal
   project.
   Weaving loom. Raku firing. Make the loom out of clay, add texture and
   then when it is finished, weave in the center.
   Stonehenge paper roll from jerry's artarama. Amazing for colored pencil
   and drawing. Buy every 3 years it lasts a long time.
   Encaustic painting with Cray-Pen crayon melting tool. OMG these are
   amazing and I had to make a sample immediately. They aren't too crazy
   expensive and would be great for my Mixed Media class.
   Never Dull wadding polish. Buy it at wal-mart in the automotive
   section. You can use it to lighten magazine images and smear the ink
   around to create textured backgrounds. Useful in collages. You can draw
   on it with sharpie or gold pen. Cheap and useful for Mixed Media
   class.
   I cam home with a big armload of fabric from a surplus donation she
   gets every year for her fibers class.
   Also, she created a google drive folder and shared tons of images and
   reference materials with me.
   Looms, portfolios, weaving and basketmaking. Room layout. I need more
   electric pencil sharpeners that actually work.
   Tempera ink resist project for art 1. Collage candy wrapper for art 1.
   Inspiration for a display board outside the art room. Make sure the
   wood is 3/4" thick so I can use nails to hang stuff. Use nice carpeting
   on it. Can be done pretty cheaply.

   Looms!! She has her husband build these for her. Saving for later!!
     __________________________________________________________________

   We also talked about art shows, I need 20 pieces for the COC show...she
   already has her pieces chosen! We talked about other exhibits in the
   area and the coloring book competition that she has been advertising.
   She gave me so many great resources on google drive and she is going to
   keep adding the folder.
   To me, getting to visit another art teacher's room and see how they
   organize things and to hear and watch them interact with their students
   is one of the most valuable things I can do to improve my skill. I made
   sure to ask her about assessment, and reflection, but it was wonderful
   to get ideas for future projects.

   Procedures and Routines/Classroom Management Plan
   First day
     * Explain procedures for fire, tornado, and intruder drill.
     * Explain procedures for leaving the room: have a pass for
       restrooms/drinks and office.
     * Explain procedures for getting a sharp pencil or sharpening a
       pencil.
     * Explain procedures for safety: sinks get really hot, paper cutter
       is dangerous, don’t go into the storage closet.
     * Establish your classroom rules (keep them simple):
          + 1. Listen and follow directions.
          + 2. Raise your hand before speaking or leaving your seat. (I
            did not do this one as I wanted them to be free to go to the
            sink or get a pencil without checking in with me)
          + 3. Keep your hands and feet to yourself.
          + 4. Respect your classmates and your teacher.

     * Establish consequences for breaking rules. Consequences:
          + 1st time a rule is broken: Warning
          + 2nd time a rule is broken: Time-Out
          + 3rd time a rule is broken: Letter Home

   Everyday
     * Bell Work: The handbook states that student will do bell work at
       the beginning of each class. My first two years, I had little
       squares of paper on the tables for students to respond to the
       prompt: drawing, writing, or answering a question. After the bell
       work time, we would proceed with the lesson for the day. The bell
       work usually related to the project of the day, but sometimes it
       was just for fun. The bell work could also be done in the
       sketchbooks.
     * Explain procedures for the day: what to do first, what to do when
       finished, how to clean up for that particular day. If tables need
       to be reset for the next class, then point that out during your
       instructions. If you want them to put everything away at the end of
       class, make sure to mention it.
     * If it is a painting day, go over procedures for putting artwork
       into the drying rack. If it is a clay day, explain where to put
       clay so that it can dry. If it is an oil pastel day, explain how to
       wash hands without crowding the sink area.
     * Explain how to clean tables (if needed), what to do when finished
       cleaning, and what to do if they finish working before it is time
       to clean up.
     * If it is a drawing day, know that many students will not finish in
       one day, but a few will be done super early and you must have
       something for them to do if they get done early. I will list some
       ideas later.
     * If it is a new material, like metal or clay, demonstrate how to use
       the tools, the new material and explain some basic dos and don’ts.
       Be careful about listing too many ‘don’ts’ as this can give middle
       schoolers ideas and they will try something just because you tell
       them not to.
     * Make sure you know how you are going to distribute the supplies in
       advance. Are you going to pass it out? Are the kids going to come
       up and get it from you? Are they going to get it off a shelf? If
       there are a lot of papers to pass out, I would pick a student and
       then let them pick a friend to help them pass stuff out.
     * Decide in advance if you are going to play music during work time
       and have an appropriate playlist. Be prepared for someone to
       complain.
     * What works for some classes may not work for every class!

   Behavior Procedures
   Have a safe seat.
   Have a plan for everything that might happen:
     * ‘blurting out’
     * Refusal to work
     * Disrespectfulness
     * Defiance
     * Students not getting along with others at their table
     * Being overly LOUD and disruptive
     * Wandering the room
     * Crying because the project is too ‘hard’
     * What if a student wants to sit alone? Do you have a spot for them
       to move?

   Have a plan worked out with the music (or other teacher near you) about
   using safe seat/buddy rooms for BIST.
   Know what battles you are going to fight in advance. One year, I
   decided that I was going to ban all ‘throwing’. I was tired of students
   tossing erasers, paper towels into the trash can from across the room
   and even throwing pencils to each other. The more I lectured them about
   the dangers of throwing things, the more I noticed kids throwing
   things. They were throwing things just to see if I would catch them. It
   was a nightmare.
   Possible consequences for behavior: loss of privilege, safe seat, buddy
   room, talk to classroom teacher, note home, phone call home, return to
   art room during Cardinal Time or Friday Social to ‘conference’,office
   referral.
   Possible rewards for good behavior: sincere praise, pat on the back,
   silent cheer, two-minute dance party, teacher dab, note home, parent
   phone call, class party, applause from the class, artwork selected for
   display or art show, note to classroom teacher, candy, trinket or
   physical prize.
   Early finishers
   --Books (drawing, origami, architecture, zentangling, anything that
   relates to the current lesson)
   --Origami--paper and idea books
   --Drawing paper
   --Markers, crayons, colored pencils and other supplies that don’t
   require a lot of ‘clean up’
   --coloring sheets or activity sheets
   --Sketchbooks
   --Special things that are only available during a particular project
   (origami spinners, dragon’s eyes, tie-dye with oil pastel, Christmas
   Ornament, Mother’s Day card, paper snowflakes)
   Clean Up
   Procedures for clean up vary from activity to activity. Sometimes
   students can ‘clean up’ in 2 minutes, sometimes it takes 5 minutes.
   Here is a good article with tips.
   If they get cleaned up too early, they get bored and get into trouble.
   It is helpful to have a game to play at the end. If it is a 5 minute
   clean up day, like with painting or clay, you might not have 2 minutes
   to spare.
   I would usually flash off the lights to signal ‘clean up time’. In the
   past, I have rewarded the ‘best’ team in order to encourage the others
   to hurry and clean up quickly.
       Clean up Games
       Stars--This one involves marking stars on the board beside each
   team’s table color to   reward the best team of the day. The team with
   the most stars on the board at the end of class gets a prize (sticker,
   candy, trinket, origami paper, etc.) Pros: Visual reminder of who is
   doing what is expected and who needs to catch up. Cons: Can take a lot
   of time to implement, prizes cost money, you have to keep track of who
   wins and loses each day.
       Warden--Before clean up, I select a ‘warden’ to judge the other
   teams on cleanliness and sitting quietly. The warden’s job is to check
   each table, and tell the ones that still have trash or supplies out to
   put them away. The warden also selects a winning team to get a prize.
   Pros: Making a peer oversee cleanup frees the teacher up a bit to help
   if a student is having an issue. Also makes kids notice rulers, paper
   wads, and things that need to get done that they don’t otherwise notice
   if it isn’t a competition. Cons: Prizes cost money and you have to keep
   track of the warden each day and the winners each day so that they
   aren’t always the same people in every class. Also, some kids may not
   want to be the warden or may not want to listen to the warden.
       Secret Mission--Announce that there is a secret mission. Do not
   tell them the mission, but pick out a scrap of blue paper or a pencil
   in a hard to notice place. If someone does the secret mission, they get
   a prize. I also sometimes let the secret mission person pick someone
   else to get a prize also, which takes the pressure off me! Pros: Kids
   do jobs that they never noticed before, like sorting all of the paper,
   and stacking all of the markers perfectly. It can be instituted halfway
   through the year when students get lax at cleanup time.  Cons: Keeping
   track of who has won before and buying prizes, as they can get
   expensive.
   Games if You have 2 minutes at the end
   Joke Time--Students clean up with enough time to tell jokes at the end
   of class. Sometimes I would let them read from my joke book or if they
   had a good ‘school appropriate’ joke, they could stand up and share
   with the class.
   Quiz Game --quiz students over things from the lesson or previous
   projects.
   Silent ball--make ball out of a paper wad and let them throw it to each
   other silently. 6th graders especially love this one.
   Silent ball in line--Sometimes if we had 90 seconds, I would make a
   paper wad and have the class pass it to the person behind them,
   silently, from the front of the line to the back of the line (like the
   game telephone) without dropping it. If they could get it all the way
   the the end, they ‘win’ if someone drops it, they lose!
   Whole Class Reward---Each class works towards a free day or a game day.
   At the end of each class, award points for coming in quietly, doing the
   bell work, being good listeners, working quietly and cleaning up well.
   There is a chance to earn up to 5 points each day, when a class gets to
   a certain goal of 50 points (for example) they get a party.
   Pictionary--draw a picture on the whiteboard and have students guess
   what it is
   Here are my favorite articles on Smart Classroom Management:
   A Sneaky, Hidden Reason Why You’re Inconsistent
   How to Handle Aggressively Disrespectful Students

New Room, Who Dis?

   7/23/2018

   2 Comments

   I have a new art room and I am so excited for the change!
   Here is a link to my old classroom flashback post.
   I have created a new Instagram account in order to share all of my new
   high school stuff. It is a public account so please follow me @cjhs_art
   ​Now, I would like to give you a little tour of the room along with
   some links to some of the new items I picked up this summer. Some
   things I made totally new, like the shibori fabric, that I tie-dyed
   last spring. And lots of things were 'thrifted' from local places like
   the DAV, flea markets, and the Habitat for Humanity.
   In the past, I've had a painted desk, but this time I wanted something
   a little quicker than that. I used the good 'ole liquid starch hack. I
   simply held the hand-dyed fabric up and brushed liquid starch over it.
   I stretched it and it smoothed out and it dried on the metal desk.
   Simple as that.
   Picture
   ​
    I had to pack up everything in my old room, move it home, pack it up
   again and move it to my new room. My husband helped me with one load
   from my old school home, but the rest of it, I physically moved and
   loaded up all by myself.
   I've tried to be picky about what to keep and what to retire. And in
   some cases, I just wanted some fresh new stuff.
   ​Once I had the fabric on the desk, I had it in my head that I wanted
   to go for a bohemian vibe.
   Literally everyone on pinterest is either using rainbows or farmhouse
   to decorate their rooms, but with my beaded mona lisa curtain, new
   plants, and with the tie dye stuff, neither of those 'vibes' worked for
   me.
   ​I created a moodboard to kind of narrow down what I liked....because
   my problem is that I am a maximalist, not a minimalist.
   So I like LOTS of stuff. A moodboard is kind of like pinterest, but its
   a little different.
   My pinterest boards had everything I have ever liked for
   classroom/home/diy inspiration and I was able to cull in into one quick
   visual board.
   I've tried to provide links to as many of the products that I purchased
   new at the bottom of this post as possible.
   Picture
   Picture
   The lamp shade used to be plain white, I just put a little fabric on it
   to make it match. Simple makeover. I don't know if I will keep the
   paint pallet table here, since this is where my over head projector
   pulls down, but for now it hides a bit of the cord vomit. I'm not 100%
   happy with this area, I still feel like it looks cluttered, but some of
   this stuff I will use a lot so I'm still trying to figure out what to
   discard or pack up.
   Picture
   ​
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture
   The canvas fabric cubes that I had on the shelves looked too cluttered
   so I recovered these and added a wood tag and a little macrame. I still
   think the shelves look cluttered but I have a lot of stuff....so I
   might still need to edit them a bit. ​Below, you can see the small book
   shelves before I painted them white. Also, there was an annoying orange
   extension cord for the overhead projector that I have since covered in
   conduit. I hate it when cords show!
   Picture
   Picture
   I'm still trying to decide if the framed fabric needs a quote added in
   vinyl or paint......
   Picture
   This is my most obvious 'boho' corner. The green chair was at a flea
   market in Springfield for $23 and the brown was I found at habitat for
   humanity for $8. They are not in perfect condition, but I always loved
   it when my teachers had real furniture in the classroom, even if it was
   a little 'used.'
   The wicker stool was at DAV and I paid like $10 for it. The wicker vase
   and plant are the only other things I bought in the above picture. I
   figure all of this stuff will be great for still life drawing so it was
   worth the investment.
   ​Below, you can see the other plant that I bought and the two plant
   stands I purchased.
   Picture
   For the first time in 10 years, I have a window!!
   Picture
   Picture
   My room has 3 office chairs. I still opted to bring this yellow chair
   from home because I love it and I don't have a desk at home that it
   works well with.....
   Picture
   This room also has an exterior door, which has been really nice for
   moving and unloading stuff. I can pull right up to the door and viola!
   Unload! This is the view from the exterior doorway. Pottery wheels! And
   lots of wire shelving for clay.
   Picture
   These tapestries are so cool! I seriously could not decide which one to
   get...but this one was the first one that I fell in love with. I put a
   link at the bottom of this post to the one I got, but if you have a big
   blank wall space, you might look at some of the others. I hung it with
   velcro and hot glue, but I don't know if it will stay because it was
   the Dollar Tree velcro.....
   I have had some sort of star or paper lantern in every classroom I've
   ever had. At first, I wasn't going to have anything hanging from the
   ceiling but I spray painted the BIG gold one (used to be pink and
   white), and I had the green one at home. The white one is from home, I
   just added a little blue paint to make it look sort of tie dyed and now
   I can't imagine this space without the suspended stars.
   Picture
   This room really is big, with a couple of different areas.
   Picture
   Picture
   These mirrors were $5 walmart buys. They came white and I just used a
   little blue acrylic to make a design on the edges. The map bunting I
   made several years ago from an old atlas.
   Picture
   Picture
   Picture
   The open storage you can see in the mirror here is still a work in
   progress. I put a bunch of stuff up in the top that I might try to put
   elsewhere....Mostly, this will be a place where we store portfolios and
   'in-progress' work. We can work on LARGE projects because we have
   plenty of space!
   Picture
   This is the view from behind my desk. These panorama photos are a bit
   misleading so I made a 360 video.
   Picture
   The room has two entrance doors, three closet doors and one exterior
   door. Above is the view from one of the doors. Below is the view from
   the other door.
   Picture
   Picture
   ​
     __________________________________________________________________

   I like that the room has two light switches, I can have half of the
   lights on at a time, I should've turned them all on for this photo (and
   taken this single chair down, oops). But above the cabinets is some
   dead space that I have decorated with some oversized art supplies. Some
   people like to use that space for storage.....and I might need to do
   that eventually, but for now, I'm going to try to keep it uncluttered
   and 'decorative'.
   Picture
   The scissors are paper mache that I made with a student teacher several
   years ago. They have travelled to most of my art rooms. This year, I
   added the letters MAKE ART, which I painted in July, inspired by the
   artist Jen Stark.
   Picture
   The prisma color box used to be a box of crayons, but I painted over it
   this year. The 'messy' watercolor box and the big crayola marker are
   new this year.
   Picture
   Picture
   Picture
   I had a tendency to clutter up the area above my cabinets in the past,
   you can see the old crayon box, which is now a prismacolor box...I
   still have the paint jar, but it doesn't look right with the other new
   stuff so I took it down. The globes I left at my old school and I also
   left the manikins.
   I am so grateful to the last art teacher for leaving such well-labeled
   and organized art cabinets, so helpful!! Made my job this summer a lot
   easier.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture
   Today, (after I took this picture) the custodian offered to adjust all
   of the desks so they are the same height, which I think will help when
   sharing supplies. The desks are like mini drafting tables, but the
   mechanism inside is a little janky so they don't really work right
   anymore.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture
   As you can see it is a nice big room. In at least one of my classes, I
   will have more than one 'class' at the same time...so it will be nice
   to have several learning areas to utilize. My new schedule is block, so
   I will have 3 long classes and one long planning period each day. I am
   most excited about the new schedule and the window in my art room.
   School doesn't start for another week, so I have been working on lesson
   plans and syllabi and new emergency sub plans. It has been a busy
   summer with moving, changing to a new job and learning all the new ins
   and outs, but it is also really exciting and I am looking forward to
   all the changes!
   Product Links:
   Here is all the stuff I bought.
   Growth mindset Activities Bunting on TPT, posted above my board. I
   printed it on a color printer and laminated it.
   Maritime Wall Tapestry Wall art for only $15.91 !! They have the Great
   Wave and Starry Night, but this one just felt right.
   Cavallini Papers Color Wheel Vintage Style I sprung for the one on the
   wood rod...even thought it was way more expensive than the poster by
   itself.
   Green Click 34 ft LED Outdoor globe String Lights with Remote
   Control. I like the warm light ones, and I bought a color string for my
   porch at home.
   Darice Square Bevel Mirror For $5 each at Walmart.
   Llama ceramic planter. Mine was a gift!
   Mint Lexington 3 Tier cart I bought this last year at Michaels.
   Lamp, and chairs and wicker table were thrifted.
   ​Paint Palette Wood Table on clearance at Hobby Lobby.
   I dyed most of the fabric myself. Using the Jacquard Mini Indigo Tie
   Dye kit at Michaels.
   I found the Rag Rug at Ross for $10 so I though it was a good buy.
   ​
   Joann Fabric had a bunch of Indigo Shibori Decor items like pillows at
   the start of summer. I went in at the end to see what was left and 70%
   off, but most was gone, I got the idea to frame a piece of dyed
   fabric.... and I did buy about 3 yards of a shibori looking design, but
   I learned that it is so much cheaper to dye your own. The cut I got was
   like $20 and I used a coupon to make it a little cheaper. They have
   more fabric, if I need it in a pinch.
   Michaels has a bunch of 'indigo' accessories: duct tape, washi tape,
   ribbon, garland/banners, but most of it was not on sale and I could not
   justify spending money on it at full price. Now I need at least 3 more
   rolls so I will be going back. I couldn't find a link for this.
   Picture
   This is a small bulletin board that I have outside my room. I printed a
   bunch of 4X4 photos but I didn't have a good wall space that looked
   right to use them as a mural so I ended up using them for this bulletin
   board instead.
   Picture
   Finally, in case you are an art teacher and you are curious about the
   state of my closets....have a look here.

Art Room FlashBack

   7/23/2018

   0 Comments

   OMG! I am so excited to show you a new space this year. ​I am moving to
   a high school art job in a new district and I am thrilled for a new
   opportunity.
   Before I show you my new art room I want to do an Art Room Flashback,
   as many teachers are getting their rooms ready right now, I thought it
   might be helpful to have some inspiration.
   I taught in the middle school room for summer school for a few years
   before I moved to it in 2014.
   Before I decorated my middle school art room in 2014.
   ​After I decorated it.
   Updated decor and additions in 2018.
   Here is an even farther flashback to my elementary art room
   2013-2014 and a few pics here.
   Of course you change a few things every year. Here are a few pics of my
   room in action so you can see how full it was once the students were in
   there...a very busy, tight space. I would've really liked to get rid of
   my teacher's desk to make more room in there, but I always needed a
   spot for sub plans and it felt like the best place for them.
   Picture
   Picture
   Picture
   The space above the cabinets was a little cluttered with junk.....
   Picture
   This was a 'bell ringer' type activity. I drew a bunch of types of ever
   green trees on the board and had them draw as many as they could on dry
   erase boards. It was a good warm up. I like to change up my room a bit
   for the holidays.
   Picture
   Picture
   Even with all of the student supplies in the 'store' my middle school
   students still had trouble finding basic things like pencils.....
   Picture
   Picture
   Picture
   I tried to clear up some of the clutter, but with a single small
   counter (also holding my paper cutter) it was hard to keep it looking
   uncluttered.
   Picture
   Thank goodness for that curtain covering the mess of a closet!
   Picture
   My 'timeout' spot is by the door. We use BIST so sometimes I had
   someone in the 'buddy seat' and sometimes I had them sit there if they
   needed to cool off or even just to focus.

   Art Room Tour SPRING 2017

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/n4iOf8aKSO4?wmode=opaque

   I will tell you that it was much easier to move the first time. Even
   though I had two art rooms when I taught elementary, when I moved to
   the middle school across town, I just put everything in the middle of
   the room and a crew of custodians moved all of my furniture and boxes.
   This time around, I took a load home almost every day of books, decor
   items and accumulated junk. Over spring break, I went through several
   of my totes and condensed as much as I could down, and got rid of a
   bunch of fabric and junk. I had to have everything out before the last
   day of school, so my husband went with me, and we got almost everything
   the weekend before the last day. We put it all in my garage.
   Several days in June/July, I took loads of stuff to my new room and
   started sorting it an organizing it. I still have a pile in the garage
   that I hate to get rid of but I probably won't need since I will be
   teaching high school.
   Picture
   My My load of stuff that I brought home. It was kind of a cool looking
   truck load. The photo below is a pic of my room undecorated. I left a
   few things for the new art teacher, like the tables, which were a gift
   from a friend...and the paint cans and my cool painted desk and the
   rugs and the styrofoam paint pallet that I painted...and the cool knobs
   on all of the cabinet drawers. Hopefully it is appreciated by a new
   teacher in the future.

   For now, I am busy decorating my new room. TRYING to purge old
   'babyish' stuff and overall trying not to make my new space look too
   cluttered. I am not a minimalist. I am a maximalist to the max.

Hippie Van Sub Plan

   5/30/2018

   0 Comments

   I guess while I'm on the subject of favorite sub plans, I will share my
   'hippie' van. I am rarely gone, but this year I had a few extra
   absences at the end of the year so I whipped up a few extra 'sub'
   plans. (Submarine Sandwich, The Art Sub)
   I saw this idea on insta or pinterest and wanted something that the
   kids could draw with a sub and then complete the painting part with me.
   Nothing too fancy, just draw, trace in sharpie, erase old pencil lines,
   color small details (pressing hard with wax crayon) and paint with
   watercolor or tempera cakes.
   I made a packet for each student to look at, with views of the 'hippie
   van' in side, frontal or 3/4ths view. They could draw whichever view
   they wanted.
   Here is what the substitute was supposed to read:
     Dear students, Mrs. Mitchell and her husband have purchased a
   Volkswagon Van. The van is an old ‘hippie’ van that has a lot of
   potential. It is needs to be fixed up as it was made in 1969. When it
   was new, it had new white leather interior. Now, the seats, steering
   wheel and tires all need to be replaced. The van used to be turquoise
   and white, but somebody painted it all white so now it is like a blank
   canvas. Mrs. Mitchell needs your help! She wants a spiffy new paint job
   that matches her personality. Mrs. Mitchell and her husband are
   planning to remodel the inside of the van so that it is like a little
   camper, with a bed, table and little bench seat. Their plan is to take
   the van on an epic road trip down the Route 66. Please help design the
   coolest, most colorful van ever!
    1. Explain that students will LIGHTLY sketch the van in one of those
       positions, trace in sharpie and then color SMALL DETAILS only with
       crayons today. Next time, we will paint the rest of the van and
       background with watercolor paint. This is called a wax resist.
    2. Pass out the individual sheets, (tell students NO TRACING and don’t
       write on these) and the white watercolor paper. This paper is great
       for painting, but it is kind of expensive, so please tell them to
       draw lightly in pencil first. If they make a mistake, they can
       erase or flip it over, please don’t give them extra paper unless
       they REALLY need it.
    3. Ideas for redecorating the van: recreate a famous work of art, draw
       ‘cute’ animals, make it travel themed, colorful classic ‘hippie’
       design, design with art supplies.
    4. After they draw in pencil, they should trace in sharpie. IF their
       sharpie doesn’t work good, you can give them a fresh one from the
       bin. Last, they should color small details with crayons pressing
       hard. We will paint the rest of the image next week.

   The lesson was so successful with the sub's results, that I ended up
   doing it with every class. It was fun to see how creative the students
   were! Sometimes I think they are better before they add paint.....
   Initially, I was leery of calling it a 'hippie' van, but our school
   alternates cowboy and 'hippie' day for halloween every year so I
   figured it was okay.
