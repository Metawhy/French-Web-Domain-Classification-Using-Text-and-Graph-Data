Charred Corn and Goat Cheese Avocado Toast

   Written by: Gaby Apr 28, 2016

Can you tell I’m ready for summer? It’s time. I need it in my life. And
this Charred Corn and Goat Cheese Avocado Toast needs to be in my life on a
daily basis.

   Charred Corn and Goat Cheese Avocado Toast from
   www.whatsgabycooking.com (@whatsgabycookin)

   We’ve all seen avocado toast like 100 million times, but it will never
   get old. I always jazz it up with different toppings, textures, and top
   it off with some crunchy salt and freshly cracked black pepper. It
   makes me endlessly happy and this is my latest ode to avocado toast.

   Goat Cheese. Charred Corn. Chives. Lemon. Salt. Pepper. Voila. Works
   for breakfast, lunch or even dinner!

My love for Avocado Toast runs deep. Really deep. So deep that I rounded up
my favorite 5 versions of it for you today!

   Avocado Toast 5 Ways from www.whatsgabycooking.com (@whatsgabycookin)

   Besides the traditional here’s what we’ve got going on:

   Avocado Toast with Tomatoes and my world famous Basil Vinaigrette
   (modest right?)

   Avocado Toast with Smoked Salmon and Red Onions

   Avocado Toast with Bacon and Eggs

   Avocado Toast with Goat Cheese and Chives

   Avocado Toast with Pico de Gallo

   Each one is delish and will make your mouth water! One is topped
   with tomatoes and basil vinaigrette and it’s perfect for lunch! Another
   is topped with Smoked Salmon and Red Onions which is kinda perfect for
   breakfast. As is the Avo Toast with Bacon and Eggs! I love the one
   topped with Goat Cheese and Chives and the other one with Pico de Gallo
   for a little mid-afternoon snack!

   But the truth of the matter is, you really can’t go wrong with any of
   these, at any time of the day!
