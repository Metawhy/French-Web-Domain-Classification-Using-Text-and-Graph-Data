   Syria

Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'

   Kate Allen

   Thousands of Syrians are dead and their city devastated. How dare the
   US, UK and French militaries speak of ‘surgical strikes’?

   From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria, the US and its military allies have for
   years told a tale of “precision bombing” and “surgical strikes”. It was
   a lie then and it’s a lie now. When huge numbers of bombs and missiles
   are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa,
   civilians are killed in their hundreds – possibly thousands. But still,
   the myth of precision and “meticulous processes” persists. Not least
   because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities
   they’ve bombed, and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with
   irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty.

   Last week I did what UK, US and French military officials refuse to do:
   I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a
   result of mass bombardments by the US-led coalition between June and
   October 2017.

     The coalition has refused to send investigators into Raqqa to
     establish the truth of its boast about 'precision'

   Never before have I seen a city so completely devastated. Not just in
   one district area, but almost entirely. Think Dresden and you’d be
   close. Street after street of windowless, hollowed-out buildings. Miles
   of rubble. Piles of twisted metal. Utter ruin. There has been no
   assistance for residents desperate to rebuild, and entire families are
   reduced to living in bombed-out husks of buildings. Meanwhile, many
   children spend all day scavenging in the rubble for bits of steel and
   plastic they can sell so as to buy food. They risk injury and death
   from unsafe buildings and uncleared landmines.

   Among those I met in this ruined city was Mohamed, a 28-year-old
   carpenter who cares for his younger brother, Rabi’a, who is now
   paralysed after a coalition airstrike destroyed the building where his
   family was sheltering in October 2017. Most of his family were killed.
   Mohamed lost his wife, two children (the youngest of whom was 11 days
   old), his parents, his sister, her husband and their four children.
   With his family as devastated as the city he still inhabits, Mohamed
   has devoted himself to looking after his brother. It’s heartbreaking,
   tragic and deeply moving.

   The battle to oust Islamic State from Raqqa followed the modern US
   military playbook. A massive aerial assault conducted with willing
   military powers (here, the UK and France); zero use of ground troops;
   and a reliance on proxy fighters at street level (here, the Kurdish-led
   Syrian Democratic Forces militia). The bombardment was immense. For
   four months the coalition pounded the city into the ground – with
   thousands of airstrikes (215 from the UK, says the MoD) and 30,000 US
   artillery rounds. Never mind that artillery is notoriously imprecise
   and should not be used in heavily populated areas (such use is
   “indiscriminate” in international legal parlance), the coalition fired
   artillery round after artillery round into residential areas for four
   solid months. In fact, as US forces themselves boasted, more artillery
   was fired into the streets, squares and homes of downtown Raqqa than
   has been fired in any conflict in the world since Vietnam.

   ‘More than 11,000 buildings are uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely
   considered the most-destroyed city of modern times.’

   As I saw for myself, the results are predictably apocalyptic; 80% of
   the city has been reduced to ruins. More than 11,000 buildings are
   uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely considered the most-destroyed city of
   modern times.

   On top of this lethally irresponsible behaviour, the coalition has
   refused to send investigators into the ruined city to establish the
   truth of its boast about “precision”. It has refused to set up a
   compensation fund for those maimed or bereaved by its handiwork. And –
   perhaps most worryingly of all – it has refused to even try to learn
   lessons from this latest exercise in mass bombing without
   responsibility.

   Recently, Amnesty and Airwars presented the UK, US and French
   authorities with detailed evidence from our own painstaking
   on-the-ground investigation showing that at least 1,600 civilians in
   Raqqa were killed by the coalition’s aerial attacks, 10 times more than
   previously acknowledged. Collating huge data streams from
   investigations spanning almost two years and including multiple visits
   to Raqqa, we built a database of the victims, with names for more than
   1,000 of the dead.

   For the last two years, the coalition’s responses have been a mix of
   denial, attacks on the messenger and grudging acknowledgement of a
   small number of deaths when presented with irrefutable evidence.

We lost faith in joint efforts to halt wars. Result? Ask Syria...

   Last year, after Amnesty published a 70-page report based on 42 site
   visits in Raqqa and interviews with 112 beleaguered Raqqa residents,
   then defence secretary Gavin Williamson responded not with alarm at the
   report’s findings but with a broadside against Amnesty from the House
   of Commons despatch box. Our report was “deeply disappointing” and
   “disgraceful”. We needed to recognise the “amazing professionalism of
   our Royal Air Force”. Flag-waving rather than dealing with the
   unpalatable facts – this was yet another aggressive denial from a
   government increasingly unwilling to hold its own military forces to
   account.

   Last week, Willamson’s successor Penny Mordaunt signalled that the UK
   would in future go even further in its refusal to deal with alleged war
   crimes committed by UK forces overseas.

   The fact that Isis fighters terrorised and effectively held hostage
   vast populations in Syria and Iraq doesn’t justify the coalition in
   indiscriminate bombing campaigns. Our armed forces are supposed to be
   better than that. If they are not, it is largely because our
   politicians and top brass continue to wave their flags and hide behind
   the lie of precision.

   exhibition, War in Raqqa: Rhetoric versus Reality, based on Amnesty’s
   Raqqa research, is at the Architectural Association until 30 May

Argentina's women joined across South America in marches against violence

   The crowd of women packed into the historic square of Plaza de Mayo in
   downtown Buenos Aires under the freezing rain was so vast that some had
   to close their umbrellas to all fit together. “Machismo Kills,” read
   the hand-painted sign held aloft by one young woman.

   Tens of thousands of women marched here on Wednesday to protest the
   growing problem of violence against women in Argentina, a problem so
   prevalent that the country sanctioned a law four years ago legally
   defining as “femicide” cases of domestic violence, so-called “honour”
   killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.

   The Buenos Aires march was matched by others across Argentina and other
   South American countries, after women’s groups called for solidarity
   via social media under the hashtags #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”,
   meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) and #BlackWednesday.

   “This is a march against femicide,” supreme court judge Elena Highton
   de
   Nolasco told the press on the eve of the march. “Cases of femicide are
   growing in number, they are becoming more violent, more perverse – we
   even
   had the news today that there have been 19 femicides in the last 18
   days.”

   “Walking home I want to feel free, not brave,” read another sign by one
   of the marchers on Wednesday.

   “I came because they are killing women who could be my sisters, my
   friends,” said one young marcher.

   Similar marches were held in all of Argentina’s main cities, while the
   Ni Una Menos movement transcended the country’s borders. Demonstrations
   also took place in Mexico, El Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and
   Uruguay.

   The protest was prompted by the abduction of Lucía Pérez, a schoolgirl
   who was drugged, raped and tortured earlier this month in the coastal
   city of Mar del Plata.

   The cruelty of her attack was such that Pérez suffered a cardiac
   arrest, according to prosecutor María Isabel Sánchez, who described it
   as “an act of inhuman sexual aggression”.

   Following their assault, the assailants washed the 16-year-old in an
   attempt to erase forensic evidence and took her to a nearby hospital,
   where she died shortly after arrival from internal injuries sustained
   during her rape.

   “I know it’s not very professional to say this, but I’m a mother and a
   woman, and though I’ve seen thousands of cases in my career, I’ve never
   seen anything like this,” prosecutor Sánchez told local media.

   But Pérez’s murder is just the latest in a harrowing sequence of
   “femicides”, crimes usually committed by husbands, boyfriends, family
   members or acquaintances of the victim. In more than one case, the
   woman has been set on fire by her partner.

   Hundreds of people took part in the march in Santiago, Chile.

   The unrelenting series of killings led Michelle Bachelet, president of
   neighbouring Chile, to post a video on Twitter saying that similar
   cases of
   violence in her own country “have led me to join Ni Una Menos, the
   social
   movement born in Argentina, which expresses the frustration felt by our
   own
   compatriots at the cases of violence against women and girls”.

   Every 30 hours in Argentina a woman is killed in such crimes, according
   to statistics kept by La Casa del Encuentro, an NGO that helps female
   victims of violence.

Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen

   Patrick Wilcken
   From Germany to Canada, governments are finally waking up to the
   catastrophe in Yemen. Saudi’s remaining allies are part of the problem

   The end of this week marks three tragedy-filled years for the people of
   Yemen, who have suffered from the Saudi-led military coalition’s
   devastating – and often indiscriminate – bombing of their country.
   Fleets of fighter jets, the bulk from Saudi Arabia itself, have wreaked
   havoc on an impoverished country, with thousands of airstrikes on
   targets including hospitals, markets, homes, factories and funeral
   halls.

   Thousands of civilians have been killed, thousands more horribly
   injured. Collapsed infrastructure, coupled with a partial blockade,
   have deprived most of the population of clean water and proper
   healthcare, unleashing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.

   Despite all this, western countries, led by the US and the UK, have
   supplied the Saudi-led coalition with huge amounts of advanced military
   equipment, facilitating a military campaign characterised by repeated
   violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war
   crimes.

Nearly half of US arms exports go to the Middle East

   This conflict has revealed in the starkest possible terms the real cost
   of the lucrative global arms trade, not to mention the challenge of
   implementing the UN arms trade treaty. Beyond the US and the UK, many
   other countries – including France, Spain and Italy – profess their
   support for human rights and adherence to the treaty while similarly
   lavishing hi-tech weaponry on the Saudi coalition.

   However, on this grim anniversary for Yemen there are glimmers of hope.
   Across the world vocal criticism from campaigners, journalists and,
   crucially, some politicians has begun to bear fruit. In recent months,
   under growing public pressure, a host of European countries have
   suspended arms transfers to the Saudi coalition. In other countries
   where arms exports have continued, they are coming under intense
   scrutiny, with court challenges and growing criticism from
   parliamentarians and the wider public.

   It’s just possible the tide may be turning.

   In Greece, there was a storm of protest in December when news emerged
   of a deal to send 300,000 tank shells to Saudi Arabia. Amid mounting
   pressure, led by Amnesty Greece, a parliamentary committee broke with
   precedent and cancelled the deal.

   UN calls for more aid to avoid largest humanitarian crisis in 70 years

   In Finland, when images surfaced in January of the United Arab
   Emirates, a key Saudi coalition member, using a Finnish-made Patria
   armoured vehicle for combat operations in Yemen, there was public
   uproar. News that Finland had granted a licence for spare Patria parts
   prompted most candidates in the recent Finnish elections – including
   the president – to speak out about arming the UAE. Norway announced in
   the same month that it was suspending exports of lethal military goods
   to the UAE (it had already stopped supplying Saudi Arabia), citing the
   risk of misuse in Yemen. Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium’s Flemish
   region have repeatedly denied licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

   The really big news, though, was the decision by Germany’s incoming
   coalition to suspend future licences for arms transfers to countries
   directly engaged in the Yemen conflict. After years of concerted
   pressure from civil society, journalists and some key politicians, one
   of the world’s major arms manufacturers has finally drawn the line. It
   remains to be seen how robust this stance will be – in the past arms
   suspensions have often been short-lived and reversed when the pressure
   abates – and, crucially, goods under current deals will still be
   shipped. But it’s another sign that opponents of these reckless arms
   sales are beginning to gain traction.

   Meanwhile, pressure is growing elsewhere as well.

   In the UK, public opinion and all opposition parties support an end to
   arming Saudi Arabia. Much of the outcry over Mohammed bin Salman’s
   recent visit to London focused on this. Dismayed at the government’s
   unwillingness to halt its vast arms sales to Saudi Arabia, campaigners
   took the UK to court, arguing that the government breached its own –
   and international – laws. It is disappointing that their case was lost
   (the government won on the grounds that its licensing decisions were
   “rational” given the evidence being assessed, notwithstanding that much
   of it had been provided by the Saudis themselves), but efforts are
   under way to appeal.

   In the US, impassioned speeches in the Senate accompanied a vote last
   June to block the transfer of $510m of precision-guided munitions and
   related services to Riyadh. The vote was lost by an unprecedentedly
   narrow margin of 47-53. Meanwhile, a new Senate resolution invoking the
   1973 War Powers Act seeks to remove US logistical and intelligence
   support for the Saudi-led coalition’s Yemen campaign on the basis that
   it amounts to US involvement in a war never authorised by Congress.

Why is Saudi Arabia in Yemen and what does it mean for Britain?

   And in Canada, France, Italy and Spain we are seeing a flurry of
   challenges to arms supplies to the coalition – including court cases,
   activism and intense public debate.

   A growing legal and moral quandary now faces European supplier
   countries that still pour weapons into the bloody conflict. Under the
   UN arms trade treaty, they have an obligation to halt the supply of
   weapons if these are likely to be used for serious violations of
   international human rights or humanitarian law. The US, as a signatory,
   has pledged not to undermine the treaty’s object and purpose, which
   includes “reducing human suffering” – a commitment mocked by the
   current desperate situation on the ground in Yemen.

   As Yemen enters another gruelling year of hunger, disease and war, with
   more than 20 million of its people now in need of humanitarian aid, the
   moral and legal bankruptcy of western support for the Saudi-led
   coalition has never been clearer.

   A growing number of countries have recognised the risk of ever-greater
   complicity in the mounting violations and likely war crimes being
   committed in Yemen. It’s time for the Saudi coalition’s remaining arms
   suppliers to follow suit and end their Faustian pact over weapons and
   Yemen.

Brazil officials failed to act after warning of 'fire day’ in Amazon,
prosecutors say

   Investigation into why environment agency ignored warnings that farmers
   and land-grabbers were planning day of coordinated fires

   Drone footage reveals devastation from Amazon fires – video

   Brazilian environmental officials and federal prosecutors say they sent
   a warning that farmers and land-grabbers in the Amazon were planning a
   day of coordinated fires on 10 August to send a message to far-right
   president Jair Bolsonaro, but authorities failed to act.

   Wildfires and burning deforested land are common during the Amazon’s
   dry seasons but peaked this month to more than 26,000 – the highest
   August figure since 2010. The environmental disaster has taken on
   international dimensions and overshadowed the G7 meeting in Biarritz.

   Federal prosecutors in the Amazon state of Pará have now launched an
   investigation after revealing that they warned Brazil’s environment
   agency Ibama that a “fire day” demonstration was being planned around
   the town of Novo Progresso.

   The prosecutors noted that the local Folha do Progresso news site had
   reported on plans for the fire day 5 August. “We need to show the
   president that we want to work” one local farmer told the website,
   adding that the only way to clear land for pasture was by felling trees
   and burning them.

   But Ibama did not reply to the warnings until two days after the
   protests began, when it said that its operations had been hampered
   because police support had been withdrawn, putting their teams at risk
   in a region where they already face threats.

   “It was a considerable failure,” prosecutor Paulo Moreira Oliveira told
   the Guardian. “There should have been immediate action to confront the
   risk of these fires.”

   A separate investigation is examining the rise in deforestation on
   public land in Pará and whether public bodies and authorities could be
   responsible. Moreira Oliveira said that Ibama has imposed fewer fines
   for deforestation in Pará even though forest clearance has increased
   since Bolsonaro took office.

   Two environment officials with experience in the region told the
   Guardian they also knew about the fire day beforehand. One official at
   the Chico Mendes Institute in Pará – which, like Ibama, is part of the
   ministry of the environment – said officials had asked bosses in
   Brasília for help, but requests for reinforcements were ignored.

   “I know support was requested for an emergency plan, but it was not
   answered,” the official said. Both spoke anonymously because the
   government has banned environment officials from talking to media.

   Brazil’s prosecutor-general Raquel Dodge said on Monday that there was
   a “suspicion of orchestrated action,” the G1 news site reported.

Brazilian Amazon deforestation surges to break August records

   Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked Ibama for running a “fines industry”
   and vowed to open up the Amazon for development.

   He first blamed the fires on NGOs but provided no evidence, then
   conceded that farmers were also setting land on fire to increase
   productive areas and called on them to stop.

   On Sunday, Brazil’s justice minister Sergio Moro tweeted that Bolsonaro
   had asked for a “rigorous investigation” and said federal police had
   been activated, after environment minister Ricardo Salles tweeted an
   article from the Globo Rural site about the “fire day”.

   The site reported that about 70 rural farmers, land grabbers and
   businessmen Novo Progresso and Altamira coordinated ‘fire day’ on the
   margins of the BR-163, a highway which leads through heavily deforested
   areas.

   “These people are Bolsonaro’s electoral base,” said another environment
   official who has worked in the area. “The last thing they want to know
   about is protecting the Amazon.”

   On Monday, the leader of a farmers’ union in Novo Progresso denied that
   there had been a plan for the fire day. “We have no knowledge of this.
   If there was anything like that, it was an isolated act,” Agamenon
   Menezes told the Agência Brasil news agency.

   The Brazilian environment ministry did not respond to a request for
   comment.

Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'

   Kate Allen

   Thousands of Syrians are dead and their city devastated. How dare the
   US, UK and French militaries speak of ‘surgical strikes’?

   From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria, the US and its military allies have for
   years told a tale of “precision bombing” and “surgical strikes”. It was
   a lie then and it’s a lie now. When huge numbers of bombs and missiles
   are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa,
   civilians are killed in their hundreds – possibly thousands. But still,
   the myth of precision and “meticulous processes” persists. Not least
   because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities
   they’ve bombed, and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with
   irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty.

   Last week I did what UK, US and French military officials refuse to do:
   I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a
   result of mass bombardments by the US-led coalition between June and
   October 2017.

     The coalition has refused to send investigators into Raqqa to
     establish the truth of its boast about 'precision'

   Never before have I seen a city so completely devastated. Not just in
   one district area, but almost entirely. Think Dresden and you’d be
   close. Street after street of windowless, hollowed-out buildings. Miles
   of rubble. Piles of twisted metal. Utter ruin. There has been no
   assistance for residents desperate to rebuild, and entire families are
   reduced to living in bombed-out husks of buildings. Meanwhile, many
   children spend all day scavenging in the rubble for bits of steel and
   plastic they can sell so as to buy food. They risk injury and death
   from unsafe buildings and uncleared landmines.

   Among those I met in this ruined city was Mohamed, a 28-year-old
   carpenter who cares for his younger brother, Rabi’a, who is now
   paralysed after a coalition airstrike destroyed the building where his
   family was sheltering in October 2017. Most of his family were killed.
   Mohamed lost his wife, two children (the youngest of whom was 11 days
   old), his parents, his sister, her husband and their four children.
   With his family as devastated as the city he still inhabits, Mohamed
   has devoted himself to looking after his brother. It’s heartbreaking,
   tragic and deeply moving.

   The battle to oust Islamic State from Raqqa followed the modern US
   military playbook. A massive aerial assault conducted with willing
   military powers (here, the UK and France); zero use of ground troops;
   and a reliance on proxy fighters at street level (here, the Kurdish-led
   Syrian Democratic Forces militia). The bombardment was immense. For
   four months the coalition pounded the city into the ground – with
   thousands of airstrikes (215 from the UK, says the MoD) and 30,000 US
   artillery rounds. Never mind that artillery is notoriously imprecise
   and should not be used in heavily populated areas (such use is
   “indiscriminate” in international legal parlance), the coalition fired
   artillery round after artillery round into residential areas for four
   solid months. In fact, as US forces themselves boasted, more artillery
   was fired into the streets, squares and homes of downtown Raqqa than
   has been fired in any conflict in the world since Vietnam.

   ‘More than 11,000 buildings are uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely
   considered the most-destroyed city of modern times.’

   As I saw for myself, the results are predictably apocalyptic; 80% of
   the city has been reduced to ruins. More than 11,000 buildings are
   uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely considered the most-destroyed city of
   modern times.

   On top of this lethally irresponsible behaviour, the coalition has
   refused to send investigators into the ruined city to establish the
   truth of its boast about “precision”. It has refused to set up a
   compensation fund for those maimed or bereaved by its handiwork. And –
   perhaps most worryingly of all – it has refused to even try to learn
   lessons from this latest exercise in mass bombing without
   responsibility.

   Recently, Amnesty and Airwars presented the UK, US and French
   authorities with detailed evidence from our own painstaking
   on-the-ground investigation showing that at least 1,600 civilians in
   Raqqa were killed by the coalition’s aerial attacks, 10 times more than
   previously acknowledged. Collating huge data streams from
   investigations spanning almost two years and including multiple visits
   to Raqqa, we built a database of the victims, with names for more than
   1,000 of the dead.

   For the last two years, the coalition’s responses have been a mix of
   denial, attacks on the messenger and grudging acknowledgement of a
   small number of deaths when presented with irrefutable evidence.

We lost faith in joint efforts to halt wars. Result? Ask Syria...

   Last year, after Amnesty published a 70-page report based on 42 site
   visits in Raqqa and interviews with 112 beleaguered Raqqa residents,
   then defence secretary Gavin Williamson responded not with alarm at the
   report’s findings but with a broadside against Amnesty from the House
   of Commons despatch box. Our report was “deeply disappointing” and
   “disgraceful”. We needed to recognise the “amazing professionalism of
   our Royal Air Force”. Flag-waving rather than dealing with the
   unpalatable facts – this was yet another aggressive denial from a
   government increasingly unwilling to hold its own military forces to
   account.

   Last week, Willamson’s successor Penny Mordaunt signalled that the UK
   would in future go even further in its refusal to deal with alleged war
   crimes committed by UK forces overseas.

   The fact that Isis fighters terrorised and effectively held hostage
   vast populations in Syria and Iraq doesn’t justify the coalition in
   indiscriminate bombing campaigns. Our armed forces are supposed to be
   better than that. If they are not, it is largely because our
   politicians and top brass continue to wave their flags and hide behind
   the lie of precision.

   exhibition, War in Raqqa: Rhetoric versus Reality, based on Amnesty’s
   Raqqa research, is at the Architectural Association until 30 May

Argentina's women joined across South America in marches against violence

   Ni Una Menos demonstrations spurred by rape and killing of 16-year-old
   Lucía Pérez as thousands of protesters call for action on crimes
   against women

   The crowd of women packed into the historic square of Plaza de Mayo in
   downtown Buenos Aires under the freezing rain was so vast that some had
   to close their umbrellas to all fit together. “Machismo Kills,” read
   the hand-painted sign held aloft by one young woman.

   Tens of thousands of women marched here on Wednesday to protest the
   growing problem of violence against women in Argentina, a problem so
   prevalent that the country sanctioned a law four years ago legally
   defining as “femicide” cases of domestic violence, so-called “honour”
   killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.

   The Buenos Aires march was matched by others across Argentina and other
   South American countries, after women’s groups called for solidarity
   via social media under the hashtags #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”,
   meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) and #BlackWednesday.

   “This is a march against femicide,” supreme court judge Elena Highton
   de
   Nolasco told the press on the eve of the march. “Cases of femicide are
   growing in number, they are becoming more violent, more perverse – we
   even
   had the news today that there have been 19 femicides in the last 18
   days.”

   “Walking home I want to feel free, not brave,” read another sign by one
   of the marchers on Wednesday.

   “I came because they are killing women who could be my sisters, my
   friends,” said one young marcher.

   Similar marches were held in all of Argentina’s main cities, while the
   Ni Una Menos movement transcended the country’s borders. Demonstrations
   also took place in Mexico, El Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and
   Uruguay.

   The protest was prompted by the abduction of Lucía Pérez, a schoolgirl
   who was drugged, raped and tortured earlier this month in the coastal
   city of Mar del Plata.

   The cruelty of her attack was such that Pérez suffered a cardiac
   arrest, according to prosecutor María Isabel Sánchez, who described it
   as “an act of inhuman sexual aggression”.

   Following their assault, the assailants washed the 16-year-old in an
   attempt to erase forensic evidence and took her to a nearby hospital,
   where she died shortly after arrival from internal injuries sustained
   during her rape.

   “I know it’s not very professional to say this, but I’m a mother and a
   woman, and though I’ve seen thousands of cases in my career, I’ve never
   seen anything like this,” prosecutor Sánchez told local media.

   But Pérez’s murder is just the latest in a harrowing sequence of
   “femicides”, crimes usually committed by husbands, boyfriends, family
   members or acquaintances of the victim. In more than one case, the
   woman has been set on fire by her partner.

   Hundreds of people took part in the march in Santiago, Chile.

   The unrelenting series of killings led Michelle Bachelet, president of
   neighbouring Chile, to post a video on Twitter saying that similar
   cases of
   violence in her own country “have led me to join Ni Una Menos, the
   social
   movement born in Argentina, which expresses the frustration felt by our
   own
   compatriots at the cases of violence against women and girls”.

   Every 30 hours in Argentina a woman is killed in such crimes, according
   to statistics kept by La Casa del Encuentro, an NGO that helps female
   victims of violence.

Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen

   Patrick Wilcken
   From Germany to Canada, governments are finally waking up to the
   catastrophe in Yemen. Saudi’s remaining allies are part of the problem

   The end of this week marks three tragedy-filled years for the people of
   Yemen, who have suffered from the Saudi-led military coalition’s
   devastating – and often indiscriminate – bombing of their country.
   Fleets of fighter jets, the bulk from Saudi Arabia itself, have wreaked
   havoc on an impoverished country, with thousands of airstrikes on
   targets including hospitals, markets, homes, factories and funeral
   halls.

   Thousands of civilians have been killed, thousands more horribly
   injured. Collapsed infrastructure, coupled with a partial blockade,
   have deprived most of the population of clean water and proper
   healthcare, unleashing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.

   Despite all this, western countries, led by the US and the UK, have
   supplied the Saudi-led coalition with huge amounts of advanced military
   equipment, facilitating a military campaign characterised by repeated
   violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war
   crimes.

Nearly half of US arms exports go to the Middle East

   This conflict has revealed in the starkest possible terms the real cost
   of the lucrative global arms trade, not to mention the challenge of
   implementing the UN arms trade treaty. Beyond the US and the UK, many
   other countries – including France, Spain and Italy – profess their
   support for human rights and adherence to the treaty while similarly
   lavishing hi-tech weaponry on the Saudi coalition.

   However, on this grim anniversary for Yemen there are glimmers of hope.
   Across the world vocal criticism from campaigners, journalists and,
   crucially, some politicians has begun to bear fruit. In recent months,
   under growing public pressure, a host of European countries have
   suspended arms transfers to the Saudi coalition. In other countries
   where arms exports have continued, they are coming under intense
   scrutiny, with court challenges and growing criticism from
   parliamentarians and the wider public.

   It’s just possible the tide may be turning.

   In Greece, there was a storm of protest in December when news emerged
   of a deal to send 300,000 tank shells to Saudi Arabia. Amid mounting
   pressure, led by Amnesty Greece, a parliamentary committee broke with
   precedent and cancelled the deal.

   UN calls for more aid to avoid largest humanitarian crisis in 70 years

   In Finland, when images surfaced in January of the United Arab
   Emirates, a key Saudi coalition member, using a Finnish-made Patria
   armoured vehicle for combat operations in Yemen, there was public
   uproar. News that Finland had granted a licence for spare Patria parts
   prompted most candidates in the recent Finnish elections – including
   the president – to speak out about arming the UAE. Norway announced in
   the same month that it was suspending exports of lethal military goods
   to the UAE (it had already stopped supplying Saudi Arabia), citing the
   risk of misuse in Yemen. Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium’s Flemish
   region have repeatedly denied licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

   The really big news, though, was the decision by Germany’s incoming
   coalition to suspend future licences for arms transfers to countries
   directly engaged in the Yemen conflict. After years of concerted
   pressure from civil society, journalists and some key politicians, one
   of the world’s major arms manufacturers has finally drawn the line. It
   remains to be seen how robust this stance will be – in the past arms
   suspensions have often been short-lived and reversed when the pressure
   abates – and, crucially, goods under current deals will still be
   shipped. But it’s another sign that opponents of these reckless arms
   sales are beginning to gain traction.

   Meanwhile, pressure is growing elsewhere as well.

   In the UK, public opinion and all opposition parties support an end to
   arming Saudi Arabia. Much of the outcry over Mohammed bin Salman’s
   recent visit to London focused on this. Dismayed at the government’s
   unwillingness to halt its vast arms sales to Saudi Arabia, campaigners
   took the UK to court, arguing that the government breached its own –
   and international – laws. It is disappointing that their case was lost
   (the government won on the grounds that its licensing decisions were
   “rational” given the evidence being assessed, notwithstanding that much
   of it had been provided by the Saudis themselves), but efforts are
   under way to appeal.

   In the US, impassioned speeches in the Senate accompanied a vote last
   June to block the transfer of $510m of precision-guided munitions and
   related services to Riyadh. The vote was lost by an unprecedentedly
   narrow margin of 47-53. Meanwhile, a new Senate resolution invoking the
   1973 War Powers Act seeks to remove US logistical and intelligence
   support for the Saudi-led coalition’s Yemen campaign on the basis that
   it amounts to US involvement in a war never authorised by Congress.

Why is Saudi Arabia in Yemen and what does it mean for Britain?

   And in Canada, France, Italy and Spain we are seeing a flurry of
   challenges to arms supplies to the coalition – including court cases,
   activism and intense public debate.

   A growing legal and moral quandary now faces European supplier
   countries that still pour weapons into the bloody conflict. Under the
   UN arms trade treaty, they have an obligation to halt the supply of
   weapons if these are likely to be used for serious violations of
   international human rights or humanitarian law. The US, as a signatory,
   has pledged not to undermine the treaty’s object and purpose, which
   includes “reducing human suffering” – a commitment mocked by the
   current desperate situation on the ground in Yemen.

   As Yemen enters another gruelling year of hunger, disease and war, with
   more than 20 million of its people now in need of humanitarian aid, the
   moral and legal bankruptcy of western support for the Saudi-led
   coalition has never been clearer.

   A growing number of countries have recognised the risk of ever-greater
   complicity in the mounting violations and likely war crimes being
   committed in Yemen. It’s time for the Saudi coalition’s remaining arms
   suppliers to follow suit and end their Faustian pact over weapons and
   Yemen.

Brazil officials failed to act after warning of 'fire day’ in Amazon,
prosecutors say

   Investigation into why environment agency ignored warnings that farmers
   and land-grabbers were planning day of coordinated fires

   Drone footage reveals devastation from Amazon fires – video

   Brazilian environmental officials and federal prosecutors say they sent
   a warning that farmers and land-grabbers in the Amazon were planning a
   day of coordinated fires on 10 August to send a message to far-right
   president Jair Bolsonaro, but authorities failed to act.

   Wildfires and burning deforested land are common during the Amazon’s
   dry seasons but peaked this month to more than 26,000 – the highest
   August figure since 2010. The environmental disaster has taken on
   international dimensions and overshadowed the G7 meeting in Biarritz.

   Federal prosecutors in the Amazon state of Pará have now launched an
   investigation after revealing that they warned Brazil’s environment
   agency Ibama that a “fire day” demonstration was being planned around
   the town of Novo Progresso.

   The prosecutors noted that the local Folha do Progresso news site had
   reported on plans for the fire day 5 August. “We need to show the
   president that we want to work” one local farmer told the website,
   adding that the only way to clear land for pasture was by felling trees
   and burning them.

   But Ibama did not reply to the warnings until two days after the
   protests began, when it said that its operations had been hampered
   because police support had been withdrawn, putting their teams at risk
   in a region where they already face threats.

   “It was a considerable failure,” prosecutor Paulo Moreira Oliveira told
   the Guardian. “There should have been immediate action to confront the
   risk of these fires.”

   A separate investigation is examining the rise in deforestation on
   public land in Pará and whether public bodies and authorities could be
   responsible. Moreira Oliveira said that Ibama has imposed fewer fines
   for deforestation in Pará even though forest clearance has increased
   since Bolsonaro took office.

   Two environment officials with experience in the region told the
   Guardian they also knew about the fire day beforehand. One official at
   the Chico Mendes Institute in Pará – which, like Ibama, is part of the
   ministry of the environment – said officials had asked bosses in
   Brasília for help, but requests for reinforcements were ignored.

   “I know support was requested for an emergency plan, but it was not
   answered,” the official said. Both spoke anonymously because the
   government has banned environment officials from talking to media.

   Brazil’s prosecutor-general Raquel Dodge said on Monday that there was
   a “suspicion of orchestrated action,” the G1 news site reported.

Brazilian Amazon deforestation surges to break August records

   Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked Ibama for running a “fines industry”
   and vowed to open up the Amazon for development.

   He first blamed the fires on NGOs but provided no evidence, then
   conceded that farmers were also setting land on fire to increase
   productive areas and called on them to stop.

   On Sunday, Brazil’s justice minister Sergio Moro tweeted that Bolsonaro
   had asked for a “rigorous investigation” and said federal police had
   been activated, after environment minister Ricardo Salles tweeted an
   article from the Globo Rural site about the “fire day”.

   The site reported that about 70 rural farmers, land grabbers and
   businessmen Novo Progresso and Altamira coordinated ‘fire day’ on the
   margins of the BR-163, a highway which leads through heavily deforested
   areas.

   “These people are Bolsonaro’s electoral base,” said another environment
   official who has worked in the area. “The last thing they want to know
   about is protecting the Amazon.”

   On Monday, the leader of a farmers’ union in Novo Progresso denied that
   there had been a plan for the fire day. “We have no knowledge of this.
   If there was anything like that, it was an isolated act,” Agamenon
   Menezes told the Agência Brasil news agency.

   The Brazilian environment ministry did not respond to a request for
   comment.

Britons indulge in surprise pre-Brexit house buying spree

   This article is more than 1 month old

   Buyers looking to complete deals before 31 October, says property site
   Rightmove

   British house hunters have launched a surprise August buying spree
   before the scheduled Brexit date, with new data showing sales reached
   their highest point since 2015 during the usually sleepy summer period.

   The number of agreed sales rose by 6.1% year on year in the month to 10
   August, according to property website Rightmove, which claims to track
   nine in 10 UK house purchases.

   House prices in the UK have mostly risen constantly since April 2012,
   according to the Office for National Statistics, but the pace of growth
   has collapsed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, from an annual rate of
   8.2% to only 0.9% in June 2019.

   London and the south of England have registered price drops in recent
   months and housing market economists have highlighted the effect of
   Brexit uncertainty, as buyers hold out for the political chaos to
   subside before making long-term decisions.

   However, Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove, said the latest
   figures suggest buyers are now looking to complete deals ahead of the
   latest Brexit deadline at the end of October.

   “Whilst another approaching Brexit deadline is now nothing new for
   prospective buyers, this one may seem more definite, and therefore one
   to beat, with the government regarding this one as ‘do or die’,” he
   said.

   “While the end of October Brexit outcome remains uncertain, more buyers
   are now going for the certainty of doing a deal, with some having
   perhaps hesitated earlier in the year.”

   Historically low mortgage rates, amid intense competition among lenders
   to sign up new borrowers, have added to the incentive to push through
   purchases in short order, he added.

   “There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial,
   financial and emotional forces driving the need to move, and with the
   average time between agreeing a sale and moving in being more than
   three months, we’re now entering the last chance saloon for those who
   want to have finished their move before the end of the year,” said
   Shipside.

   “We often see an autumn activity bounce, but perhaps this year’s
   political activities have brought that forward into a summer surge as
   buyers have gone bolder and earlier than usual.”

   Glynis Frew, the chief executive of estate agent Hunters, said the
   volume of house sales was also fuelled by sellers keen to get deals
   done.

   “Many vendors at this moment in time seem happy to demand slightly
   lower asking prices if it means they can get the deal out the door as
   quickly as possible in light of the ongoing Brexit uncertainty,” she
   said.

   The rise in the volume of sales was felt in every part of the country
   but was most pronounced in the north-east and the east of England, and
   Yorkshire & the Humber, with rises of over 10%.

   The average price of properties coming on to the market in the month to
   10 August fell by £3,192 compared to the previous month, to £305,500.
   That represented a 1% decrease, but prices remained 1.2% higher than
   the same month last year.

BBC using strong-arm tactics over iPlayer, say independent producers

   Small TV companies claim BBC trying to get them to lease shows for

   The BBC has been accused of trying to strong-arm independent TV
   producers into extending the availability of their shows on the iPlayer
   from 30 days to one year without paying millions in additional
   licensing fees.

   Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, this month gave the green light for
   the biggest expansion of the BBC iPlayer since its launch in 2007, to
   enable the corporation to fight back in the streaming war against
   Netflix and Amazon.

   Independent TV producers argue that keeping their shows exclusively on
   iPlayer longer means that they are less valuable when they are
   eventually allowed to be sold on to other services, such as Netflix or
   other buyers, which they are currently allowed to do 18 months after
   they have aired on the BBC.

   Recognising this financial issue, Ofcom has said the BBC needs to
   “adequately compensate” producers and that it may have to look to pay a
   higher price for programming.

   However, Pact, the body representing the multibillion-pound UK
   independent TV production industry, says it has been repeatedly
   contacted by members reporting that the BBC is trying to get them to
   sign off on using their shows for longer on the iPlayer without paying
   more.

   Pact says the tactics started in April, when the BBC’s proposal to
   extend iPlayer viewing rights to a year were first made public, and has
   prompted it to take the step of warning its entire member base about
   the issue.

   “The BBC has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving
   the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper
   agreement,” said John McVay, Pact’s chief executive. “Pact has warned
   its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an
   agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.”

   In addition, the BBC is also planning a huge expansion of the iPlayer
   to make programmes available on the service for up to five years in
   total.

   Proposals to do this were not part of Ofcom’s assessment, which has
   agreed to allow only children’s content to be made available on the
   iPlayer exclusively for five years, as the corporation wants to keep
   shows for a further four years on a non-exclusive basis.

   According to production company executives, the BBC is offering a
   pittance for deals offering a further two packages of streaming rights
   to programmes lasting two years each – after they have been exclusively
   on the iPlayer for a year – to keep shows on the service.

   “The proposed payment structure for these periods is risible,” said one
   senior production industry executive. “Having shows effectively
   permanently available on the iPlayer will depress the price that anyone
   else will want to pay for it.”

   The BBC has also been accused of trying to give BritBox, its joint
   venture subscription streaming service with ITV due to launch this
   year, an advantage by being first in line to pick up shows after they
   leave the iPlayer, instead of services such as Netflix.

   Following the end of the one-year exclusivity window on iPlayer, the
   BBC is proposing that shows then only be allowed to be sold to a
   platform or broadcaster that “invests in and supports the UK creative
   industries” that also agrees to carry “prominent and approved” BBC
   branding and provide audience performance data. If producers want to
   wait to sell to anyone they like, they can do so only after 18 months,
   under the BBC plan.

   This has been viewed by the production industry as attempting to
   eliminate Netflix as a bidder for shows once they are first allowed to
   be sold beyond the iPlayer.

   Netflix prefers to brand shows it buys the rights to as its own in
   international markets – the BBC’s Bodyguard was known as a Netflix
   Original outside the UK – and is secretive about sharing any data on
   the popularity of shows on its platform.

   One production industry source said: “You could have a situation where
   a programme is being broadcast on TV by the BBC for free, is on the
   iPlayer for free but also on BritBox where you would have to pay for
   it.”

   Ofcom has said the extension of iPlayer rights to a year will have an
   “adverse impact” on the launch of BritBox, but ITV has dismissed those
   concerns and did not object to the BBC’s plans.

   However, Ofcom has estimated that the increase in viewing of BBC
   iPlayer content will mean an audience reduction at Channel 4’s All4,
   ITV’s ITV Hub and Channel 5’s My5 and other online platforms. The loss
   of advertising revenue as a result is estimated at almost £15m next
   year, although Channel 4 says it will be higher, with Ofcom estimating
   that losses will grow in subsequent years.

   “Both viewers and production companies win by making programmes
   available for longer on BBC iPlayer,” said a BBC spokesman. “This is
   about keeping up with viewer expectations and is long overdue.
   Audiences are choosing to consume content on demand and the value they
   receive from their licence fee should reflect that shift.

   “We continue to have conversations with Pact and production companies
   to make this happen. Longer BBC iPlayer availability does not reduce
   the opportunities for them commercially, rather, success on the BBC
   leads to commercial success for independently produced programmes.”

   The UK’s privacy watchdog has opened an investigation into the use of
   facial recognition cameras in a busy part of central London.

   The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced she would
   look into the technology being used in Granary Square, close to King’s
   Cross station.

   Two days ago the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote to the
   development’s owner demanding to know whether the company believed its
   use of facial recognition software in its CCTV systems was legal.

   The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said it was “deeply
   concerned about the growing use of facial recognition technology in
   public spaces” and was seeking detailed information about how it is
   used.

   “Scanning people’s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives in
   order to identify them is a potential threat to privacy that should
   concern us all,” Denham said. “That is especially the case if it is
   done without people’s knowledge or understanding.

   “My office and the judiciary are both independently considering the
   legal issues and whether the current framework has kept pace with
   emerging technologies and people’s expectations about how their most
   sensitive personal data is used.

   “We have launched an investigation following concerns reported in the
   media regarding the use of live facial recognition in the King’s Cross
   area of central London, which thousands of people pass through every
   day.”

   She added: “As well as requiring detailed information from the relevant
   organisations about how the technology is used, we will also inspect
   the system and its operation onsite to assess whether or not it
   complies with data protection law.”

   On Monday the development’s owners confirmed facial recognition
   software was being used around the 67-acre, 50-building site.

   The consortium of Argent, a property developer, Hermes Investment
   Management, on behalf of BT Pensioners, and AustralianSuper, an
   Australian pension scheme, said they were doing so “in the interest of
   public safety and to ensure that everyone who visits has the best
   possible experience”.

   Liberty, the human rights campaign group, has criticised the use of the
   technology as a “disturbing expansion of mass surveillance that
   threatens our privacy and freedom of expression as we go about our
   everyday lives”.

   The ICO had previously warned businesses using the surveillance
   technology that they needed to demonstrate that its use is “strictly
   necessary and proportionate” and has a clear basis in law.

   Last month the House of Commons science and technology committee
   suggested authorities cease trials of such technology until a legal
   framework was established.

   In a report on the government’s approach to biometrics and forensics,
   the MPs referred to automatic facial recognition testing carried out by
   the Metropolitan police and South Wales police.

   They noted that an evaluation of both trials by the Biometrics and
   Forensics Ethics Group raised questions about accuracy and bias.
   Concerns were also raised that police custody images of individuals not
   convicted of any crime were not being deleted.

New chapter? UK print book sales fall while audiobooks surge 43%

   Publishers hit by surprise 5.4% fall in 2018 – but warn against
   proclaiming terminal decline

   UK book sales fell for the first time in five years in 2018, despite
   the success of bestsellers such as Michelle Obama’s autobiography,
   Becoming.

   The UK publishing industry was hit by a surprise fall of £168m (5.4%)
   in sales of physical books last year, ending a period of growth
   stretching back to at least 2014.

   Sales fell from £3.11bn in 2017 to £2.95bn last year, according to the
   latest figures from the Publishers Association, which published its
   annual yearbook on Wednesday.

   Audiobook sales surged 43% to £69m last year, with Amazon’s Audible
   service dominating sales. However, Stephen Lotinga, the chief executive
   of the Publishers Association, said this was not the sole reason for
   the decline in print sales.

   “One of the biggest changes has been the increase in audiobook sales,”
   said Lotinga. “There is some substitution away from print, audio has
   surged, but there was also always going to be a point where print sales
   couldn’t continue rising every year.”

   Some of the biggest hits last year included Michelle Obama’s Becoming,
   published in print and as an audiobook, which is on its way to becoming
   the most successful memoir in modern publishing history.

   Other big sellers included Joe Wicks’s The Fat-Loss Plan: 100 Quick and
   Easy Recipes with Workouts, Michael Wolff’s White House exposé Fire and
   Fury and John Grisham’s The Rooster Bar.

   Lotinga said the rise in the popularity of podcasts, with the music
   streaming giant Spotify spending up to $500m this year buying podcast
   companies to tap the boom, was indirectly helping the book market.

   “We think that podcasting is helping to drive a resurgence in audio in
   general, including books,” he said. “Publishers are investing a huge
   amount in building [recording] studios and securing the services of top
   quality actors to voice the books. We think the whole audio scene is
   showing huge opportunity.”

   However, he warned against pronouncing the beginning of a terminal
   decline in physical book sales in the same way the music industry has
   experienced with the move from CD to streaming in the last decade.

   Sales of printed books still accounted for over 80% of the combined
   print and digital UK book market of £3.6bn last year.

   Overall, the digital book market, which as well as audiobooks includes
   ebook sales and subscriptions to services such as Amazon’s Kindle
   Unlimited, rose 4.6% to £653m.

   “I’m not concerned that this could be a watershed moment for the
   printed book, we are not there yet,” said Lotinga. “We have not seen a
   huge shift into subscription services, piracy is low, people still love
   physical books. It is a trend halt, sales are still up 8% over the last
   five years.”

   Consumer ebook sales continued their slow decline, down 2% to £251m.
   Sales have fallen 20% since 2014 as rising competition for screen time
   from services such as Netflix, Facebook and YouTube continues to eat
   away at the popularity of ebooks and ereaders.

   Total sales of UK-published books domestically and overseas, including
   income from print and digital journals, academic and reference books,
   rose 2% to £6bn last year.

What is prorogation?

   Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament,
   normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a
   new Queen’s speech. It means parliament’s sitting is suspended and it
   ends all current legislation under discussion.

   It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary
   session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.

Boris Johnson asks Queen to suspend parliament

So is this just normal procedure?

   There are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For
   prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times.
   For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than
   a week.

   However, the five-week suspension does include a three-week period that
   would typically be recess anyway, three weeks during which the Liberal
   Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held.

   The length of the prorogation will clearly have the effect of narrowing
   rebel MPs’ options – they have two weeks fewer in parliament to pass
   any anti-no-deal legislation.

Why does Boris Johnson say he is doing this?

   Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from
   considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of
   mounting a “coup” against parliament. No 10 said there would be “ample
   time” for MPs to debate Brexit either side of the EU summit on 17
   October.

   He says the move will allow him to “bring forward an ambitious new
   legislative programme for MPs’ approval”.

Can MPs vote against prorogation?

   No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in
   the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would
   vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However,
   proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in
   this way.

How does the privy council come into this?

   The request to the Queen and the proposed timetable was made at a privy
   council meeting at Balmoral by a small number of senior ministers who
   attend the meetings.

   There has been some confusion because technically senior opposition MPs
   are members of the privy council, including Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour
   leader. But these MPs do not go to actual meetings, that is the
   preserve of a select number of senior ministers, led by Jacob
   Rees-Mogg, who is the lord president of the council.

Could the Queen have refused the privy council’s request?

   Technically, yes under the royal prerogative. But in reality it would
   have been extremely difficult for her to do so. Corbyn has written to
   her saying that “there was a danger that the royal prerogative is being
   set directly against the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons”.

How will this affect plans to stop no deal?

   Less than 24 hours after Corbyn and other opposition MPs came to an
   agreement that they would use legislative efforts to stop no deal,
   rather than the “nuclear option” of an immediate no-confidence vote, it
   looks like the window for potential legislation has become far
   narrower.

   It makes the prospect of a snap no-confidence vote far more likely and
   remainer MPs will need to weigh up that option again. Corbyn has
   offered to lead a caretaker government to negotiate an extension to
   article 50 and then call a general election – an offer that is highly
   unpalatable to most Conservative MPs.

   The Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he
   would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days before
   parliament’s return next week.

   Grieve said a no-confidence vote was now more likely. “If it is
   impossible to prevent prorogation then I think it is going to be very
   difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government
   and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to
   table a motion for a vote of no confidence,” he said.

Will there be legal action to stop prorogation?

   There will certainly be an attempt. The campaigner Gina Miller revealed
   on Wednesday evening that her lawyers had made an urgent application to
   the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson’s plan to
   prorogue parliament.

   The SNP MP Joanna Cherry has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal
   team about speeding up the planned action in the Scottish courts, which
   was due to be heard on 6 September.

   Labour’s Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70
   MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an
   interim interdict – similar to an injunction in England and Wales – in
   the court of session to block prorogation.

   Led by Jolyon Maugham QC’s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking
   a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going
   to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were
   exhausted.
