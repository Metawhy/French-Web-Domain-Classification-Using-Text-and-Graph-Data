   Read a review about going first thing and I can definitely recommend
   that. The exhibition floors are amazing and the kids could explore with
   space and enjoy everything without queuing. This attraction is a must
   if you want to take on the sights of New York.

   If You Haven’t Been in a While, Go Again!

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

   Not Just a Great View!

   5 of us visited and 5 of us came away absolutely thrilled! Whilst the
   views are obviously amazing, you will also enjoy the sizeable effort
   put into making the museum portion of the experience interesting and
   easy to take in. I would totally recommend this experience to anyone
   visiting New York.TIP: Visit at nighttime for MUCH shorter queues and
   see the colourful lights of New York.

   If You Haven’t Been in a While, Go Again!

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

   Read a review about going first thing and I can definitely recommend
   that. The exhibition floors are amazing and the kids could explore with
   space and enjoy everything without queuing. This attraction is a must
   if you want to take on the sights of New York.

   If You Haven’t Been in a While, Go Again!

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.
