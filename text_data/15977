Rex Whistler Restaurant

   Sample our award-winning wine list and seasonal British menus
   surrounded by Rex Whistler's Mural 'The Expedition in Pursuit of Rare
   Meats'

Opening times

   Monday to Sunday 12.00–14.45

   Tate Britain, Millbank, London SW1P 4RG

   © Rikard Österlund

   Originally opened in 1927, the Rex Whistler Restaurant was described as
   ‘The Most Amusing Room in Europe’, owing to its specially commissioned
   mural, The Expedition in Pursuit of Rare Meats. It has been the site of
   political and social intrigue over the decades, as well as gaining a
   reputation for having one of the capital’s finest wine cellars.

     The wine list – long a whispered, greedy little secret among the
     capital’s bibulous – should be preserved for the nation in the
     galleries above.
     Marina O'Loughlin, The Guardian

   The wine cellar is overseen by our sommelier Gustavo Medina, who would
   be delighted to make recommendations and decant wine prior to your
   arrival. Contact Gustavo via email.

   The Rex Whistler is also available for hire for corporate and private
   events.

   The Rex Whistler is available for private dining on seven nights per
   week (subject to avaliability). We can accommodate between 25 and 90
   guests for dinner, with menus starting at £45 per person. For further
   information, please call 020 7887 8825 or email
   private.dining@tate.org.uk

   Join us on a Sunday for a Roast Sunday Lunch - see sample menu below
   for more detail.
