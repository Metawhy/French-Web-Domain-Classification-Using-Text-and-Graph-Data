   Ghost of Tsushima is my most anticipated title after of course tlou2.
   Hearing about PSVR2 also warms my heart. I will buy both day one.

   I don't understand these companies who won't delay their games to have
   better launch titles for their new systems, even 1 year in advance. I
   don't know, must be unreasonable, but it's definitely the culprit as to
   why the PS4's launch lineup sucked, imagine if they had TLOU and Gran
   Turismo 6 as launch titles for the PS4.
   I'm predicting smaller, more VR-oriented announcements during this
   event, no PSX, and a megaton E3 next year.

       (May 2020)
     * PlayStation Meeting (Feb.12): PS5 reveal+TLOU2+GoT
     * PSVR2 under development

   Sounds legit, in line with the PS5 November 2020 launch I expect and a
   PSVR2 announcement maybe somewhere in 2021.

   Nintendo has mastered the art of delaying a current gen title for the
   their nextgen console. BOTW and Twilight Princess being the most famous
   ones.
   Hell, gamers that bought a WIIU got the equivalent of "blue balls"
   waiting all last gen on Zelda. I should know because my balls have not
   been the same since.

   100% agree.
   Multiplatform games carried the Ps4 in the early days and the gap
   towards the Xbox One was not that big.
   That changed dramatically later on with the hugely successful first
   party games and snowball.
   If they had a stronger launch line up, Ps4 could've outsold Xbox One by
   3:1 worldwide and not only a little over 2:1

   It was awful. The first 3 E3's were a drag because all they did was
   announce games that were either years in advance or small Indie titles
   and multiplatform Indies at that.

   Not all 4chan leaks turn out false. That said you should you take any
   rumor with a grain of salt. This one has some weight to it though since
   it seems pretty percise and is using language that seems like it could
   be truthful.
   Regardless, you always take these things with a grain of salt and use
   your own conclusions.

   A little strange to say marketing in the coming months will concentrate
   on Death Stranding and TLOU2 when TLOU2 isn't due until May according
   to the leak.
   Maybe TLOU2 is arriving earlier than May?
   I'm looking forward to hearing more about the PS5 at last too.

   There's lulls with every system. I was content with ganes like
   Driveclub, Infamous and KZ mp. I thought thy did a great job of having
   a gd amount of f2p games available at launch to fill in voids.

   I don't believe any of these 4chan leaks personally (why not post here
   or Reset?) but this one is notable as it doesn't even mention the 25th
   anniversary. I seriously doubt Sony will skip doing something for it
   from mid-November through the Game awards in early December at least.
   They still have a 20th anniversary section on the PlayStation website.

   Its not exactly implausible, but I'm a bit dubious about the timings
   also. I would expect them to tap the gas a bit more during the holiday
   season with some sort of anniversary showcase.
   That being said, its not going to be too far off the reality, no matter
   what. August has Gamescom, September TGS, so realistically October is
   going to be the first month they have open to do additional promotion.
   My only doubt is due to the first quarter of calendar 2020 being really
   stacked, December seems like a perfect month to do something big.

   So when is Sony going to reveal the name of their new studio? Are they
   waiting to acquire more studios first so they can announce them all at
   once?
   Why so secretive?

   Yesterday I went to Hogans Beach which is a restaurant/outdoor beach
   bar area and my god it was fucking terrible. I knew as soon as my
   family said we should go to that restaurant Hulk Hogan bought that we
   were in for some shit.
   Sat down at this place and there were six waitresses. All. Doing.
   Fucking. Nothing. Literally every single one of them were walking in
   rounds around the restaurant, not talking to any tables or anything.
   After five minutes my sister went up to the pay counter and asked for
   some service and menus. One girl came over, told us she'd be right
   back, then walked off and did nothing. After fifteen minutes we finally
   get a drink order in.
   We ordered some conch fritters and those shits were like eight dollars.
   What do they serve us? I wish I had a picture. It was like five
   fritters ontop of a bed of soggy, dead looking grass stuff. My sister
   ordered some crab legs and was literally given three small crab legs.
   My blackened chicken sandwich was unsalvageable even by the avocado
   they put on it.
   So fuck you Hulk Hogan your restaurant is shitty and you take weird
   pictures of your daughter. Also nobody likes to dine with the same mans
   picture adorning every single wall and giving you crazy looks while you
   try to eat shitty food.

   I guess he's proud that his daughter is attractive and has nice legs.
   They are rather nice.

   Actually in UPBftU Endless Unperfect #2 Revengeance, it's gonna be
   Hogan vs Kenshiro.
   If Hogan wants me to jcak off to his daughter, or even to him, I'd do
   whatever he says. I'll do anything Hogan says, bet money on it.

   WWF/WCW Hogan would win because he has creative control as part of his
   contract and wouldn't job to a tiny foreigner like Goku. If Goku showed
   up as the Giant Saiyan Ape they might be able to work a program and
   make some serious dough brother.
   Either that or you could say Hogan beat Inoki, who drew with Ali, who
   beat Superman.
   Do Hogan's promos about riding Harleys in Death Valley and doing
   superhuman feats count as canon?

   I agree.
   I think that Ghost of Tsushima it will probably have the potential to
   represents one of the very first and big games that will be able to
   exploit the potential of the new console.
   Hype for the next State of Play (1 November 2019), and for the
   Playstation Meeting (12 February) 2020.

   Fake.
   Microsoft has a marketing deal with EA for Jedi Fallen Order, no way
   that the game will show up at a State of Play episode. Also, the May
   2020 release date for TLOU2 makes no sense at all, I mean, every single
   leak it's pointing towards a February release.

   Maybe it will come back for PS5 after Ghost of Tsushima.

   I wouldn't find it strange if Ghost of [insert name here] becomes their
   franchise.
   Given the time and money being spent and reboot and what's not we are
   hearing to meet next-gen standards* it doesn't strike me as a one off
   project.
   More so with larger and probably more dynamic worlds being possible
   with the upcoming generation, the market has space for something like
   that because all other rendition (to my knowledge) have a western
   theme.

   It will be interesting to see the new PSVR 2 in the next 1/2 years.
   And to see how much it will be evolved compared to the previous one

   Maybe they still don't have any new studio. Or if they have it, they
   may still not have a name.

   I think it will happen either at the Playstation Meeting on February
   12th 2020.
   (to present the studies that are working on new games for the new
   console)
   Or directly to E3 2020.

   Yeah, they had great gameplay. The quest design was far too bland and
   got worse as the series went on, but playing it was awesome. SP is a
   fantastic and underrated studio, I hope they don't fuck up their great
   catalogue by making Ghost of Sushi a walk 'em-up bonding simulator.

   I don't understand these companies who won't delay their games to have
   better launch titles for their new systems, even 1 year in advance. I
   don't know, must be unreasonable, but it's definitely the culprit as to
   why the PS4's launch lineup sucked, imagine if they had TLOU and Gran
   Turismo 6 as launch titles for the PS4.
   I'm predicting smaller, more VR-oriented announcements during this
   event, no PSX, and a megaton E3 next year.

   It wouldn't be exclusive to PS5, it will still be released on PS4.
   Ghost of tsushima should be a cross gen title.
   It would literally be a 4K/60fps game on PS5 hardware.

   I love the PSVR too, but it is still hurting for the really good games.
   Astrobot is probably the only VR system seller imo. There are other
   really good games like Moss and Tetris Effect, but still not enough.

   Nah thts all opinion. There's over 10 games thts lit imo and well worth
   entry. Firewall, Moss, ASTRO, PSVR Resi Evil, Arizona Sunshine, Beat
   Saber, Blood and Truth,Borderlands VR, Super Hot, Far Point, Rush of
   Blood, Star Trek Bridge crew, etccc
   Idc if not all are exclusives I have played all of these and enjoyed
   them on PSVR and thy were all worth it to me. Every game doesn't have
   to be a Super Mario 64 moment or system seller even though Astrobot Def
   is imo they just need to have a nice package and the support for PSVR
   has been great, again imo.

   I think there is not much correlation in announcing the launch date of
   The Last of Us Part 2 before the release of Death Stranding.
   Because, in any case, both games will have the opportunity to make
   their marketing path in extreme comfort, considering the times taken by
   Sony with the next State of Play on November 1st, and the next
   Playstation Meeting on February 12th 2020.

   Think of the positive side.
   The more time Naughty Dog has to work on The Last of Us Part 2, the
   greater the final quality of the work will be.
   Furthermore, considering that the game will be released in May 2020, it
   can be a great preview of what will await us on the Sony stage for the
   future E3 2020.

   It's not wise take the words of the "insiders" in general for "true".
   (and especially the best known ones)
   For the simple reason that they are the first to be "guided" in
   diverting attention based on various factors.
   (including those of "personal profit" on the credibility given to them)
   For example this:
   (cover of a Switch Mini, passed off as fake by the insider, and instead

   I hope PS5 doesn’t launch until late 2021 or 2022. That’s right, you

   PS4 is struggling to run the latest games, you can see that with
   Battlefield V (low res, unstable framerate), Days Gone (unstable
   framerate), Ace Combat 7 (low res, unstable framerate) and many other
   recent releases. Next year the hardware will be pushed beyond it's
   actual limits by games like FF7R (low res) and Cyberpunk 2077 (low res,
   heavily downgraded compared to the enhanced consoles/PC), and while
   titles like TLOU Part II and Ghost of Tsushima are going to look and
   run really well, that would be because those games are First Party
   projects running on engines optimized and built with the strenghts and
   weaknesses of the PS4 hardware in mind.
   Personally I want the PS5 to come out as soon as possible because I'm
   starting to see how we have reached the roof of what the PS4 hardware
   is truly capable of, and beside all of that, I just want to see how
   next-gen games look like (Avatar, EA Motive's new IP, Starfield,
   Horizon 2, the new Gran Turismo, whatever Rocksteady is working on,
   etc).

   I hope PS5 doesn’t launch until late 2021 or 2022. That’s right, you
   heard me. I believe PS4 still has a lot of life left in it. It hasn’t
   fully matured both in price and games.

   As much as I love PS4, the comming of PS5 for 2020 is almost certain.
   Both for the agreements made by Sony with AMD for the chips for the new
   generation, and to counter the arrival of the Xbox Scarlet, which
   Microsoft wants to launch by the end of 2020.
   (and I don't think Sony will leave the field free to Microsoft, in the
   console market)
   Furthermore, the latest exclusive PS4 games coming for 2020 will be
   Medievil, Death Stranding, Final Fantasy VII Remake, The Last of Us
   Part 2, and probably Ghost of Tsushima in cross-gen with PS5.
   And besides these, there are no more new exclusive games for PS4.
   (so it is likely that the new games that will be announced at the
   Playstation Meeting 2020 in February, and at E3 2020, by Sony will be
   new exclusives for the new PS5, such as Horizon Zero Dawn 2)

   I bet that by 2020 Final Fantasy XVI will be announced.
   (be it at the Playstation Meeting 2020, or E3 2020, or a dedicated
   event)

   Will this be the design of the new PS5?

   We will probably know this only during the presentation of the console,

How much is this computer worth on selling it?
       You need to determine the disk size. According to what I've read,
       it could have a 256, 512, or 768GB SSD in it. Which one is actually
       in there should make a big difference as to the price. Actually
       according to this page if it's the 2.4GHz model, it's probably a
       256GB SSD. Well, it's good to...

       Samsung. In the late 90s Samsung bought the hardware division of
       3DO Systems, which had a brand new console chipset completed that

   Ghost of Tsushima is my most anticipated title after of course tlou2.
   Hearing about PSVR2 also warms my heart. I will buy both day one.

   I don't understand these companies who won't delay their games to have
   better launch titles for their new systems, even 1 year in advance. I
   don't know, must be unreasonable, but it's definitely the culprit as to
   why the PS4's launch lineup sucked, imagine if they had TLOU and Gran
   Turismo 6 as launch titles for the PS4.
   I'm predicting smaller, more VR-oriented announcements during this
   event, no PSX, and a megaton E3 next year.

     * PlayStation Meeting (Feb.12): PS5 reveal+TLOU2+GoT
     * PSVR2 under development

   Sounds legit, in line with the PS5 November 2020 launch I expect and a
   PSVR2 announcement maybe somewhere in 2021.

   Nintendo has mastered the art of delaying a current gen title for the
   their nextgen console. BOTW and Twilight Princess being the most famous
   ones.
   Hell, gamers that bought a WIIU got the equivalent of "blue balls"
   waiting all last gen on Zelda. I should know because my balls have not
   been the same since.

   100% agree.
   Multiplatform games carried the Ps4 in the early days and the gap
   towards the Xbox One was not that big.
   That changed dramatically later on with the hugely successful first
   party games and snowball.
   If they had a stronger launch line up, Ps4 could've outsold Xbox One by
   3:1 worldwide and not only a little over 2:1

   It was awful. The first 3 E3's were a drag because all they did was
   announce games that were either years in advance or small Indie titles
   and multiplatform Indies at that.

   Not all 4chan leaks turn out false. That said you should you take any
   rumor with a grain of salt. This one has some weight to it though since
   it seems pretty percise and is using language that seems like it could
   be truthful.
   Regardless, you always take these things with a grain of salt and use

   A little strange to say marketing in the coming months will concentrate
   on Death Stranding and TLOU2 when TLOU2 isn't due until May according
   to the leak.
   Maybe TLOU2 is arriving earlier than May?
   I'm looking forward to hearing more about the PS5 at last too.

   There's lulls with every system. I was content with ganes like
   Driveclub, Infamous and KZ mp. I thought thy did a great job of having

   I don't believe any of these 4chan leaks personally (why not post here
   or Reset?) but this one is notable as it doesn't even mention the 25th
   anniversary. I seriously doubt Sony will skip doing something for it
   from mid-November through the Game awards in early December at least.
   They still have a 20th anniversary section on the PlayStation website.

   Its not exactly implausible, but I'm a bit dubious about the timings
   also. I would expect them to tap the gas a bit more during the holiday
   season with some sort of anniversary showcase.
   That being said, its not going to be too far off the reality, no matter
   what. August has Gamescom, September TGS, so realistically October is
   going to be the first month they have open to do additional promotion.
   My only doubt is due to the first quarter of calendar 2020 being really
   stacked, December seems like a perfect month to do something big.

Why was Jeffrey Epstein’s death on 4chan before it became public?

   Before The Post broke the news of Jeffrey Epstein’s death, it was
   posted to online message board 4chan — prompting the FDNY to probe
   whether one of its paramedics leaked the details. The user made …

   So when is Sony going to reveal the name of their new studio? Are they
   waiting to acquire more studios first so they can announce them all at
   once?
   Why so secretive?

   Yesterday I went to Hogans Beach which is a restaurant/outdoor beach
   bar area and my god it was fucking terrible. I knew as soon as my
   family said we should go to that restaurant Hulk Hogan bought that we
   were in for some shit.
   Sat down at this place and there were six waitresses. All. Doing.
   Fucking. Nothing. Literally every single one of them were walking in
   rounds around the restaurant, not talking to any tables or anything.
   After five minutes my sister went up to the pay counter and asked for
   some service and menus. One girl came over, told us she'd be right
   back, then walked off and did nothing. After fifteen minutes we finally
   get a drink order in.
   We ordered some conch fritters and those shits were like eight dollars.
   What do they serve us? I wish I had a picture. It was like five
   fritters ontop of a bed of soggy, dead looking grass stuff. My sister
   ordered some crab legs and was literally given three small crab legs.
   My blackened chicken sandwich was unsalvageable even by the avocado
   they put on it.
   So fuck you Hulk Hogan your restaurant is shitty and you take weird
   pictures of your daughter. Also nobody likes to dine with the same mans
   picture adorning every single wall and giving you crazy looks while you
   try to eat shitty food.

   I'm glad that there's finally a Hogan thread in OT again. Some days
   Hogan is all I can think about.

   Actually in UPBftU Endless Unperfect #2 Revengeance, it's gonna be
   Hogan vs Kenshiro.
   If Hogan wants me to jcak off to his daughter, or even to him, I'd do
   whatever he says. I'll do anything Hogan says, bet money on it.

   WWF/WCW Hogan would win because he has creative control as part of his
   contract and wouldn't job to a tiny foreigner like Goku. If Goku showed
   up as the Giant Saiyan Ape they might be able to work a program and
   make some serious dough brother.
   Either that or you could say Hogan beat Inoki, who drew with Ali, who
   beat Superman.
   Do Hogan's promos about riding Harleys in Death Valley and doing
   superhuman feats count as canon?

   I think that Ghost of Tsushima it will probably have the potential to
   represents one of the very first and big games that will be able to
   exploit the potential of the new console.
   Hype for the next State of Play (1 November 2019), and for the
   Playstation Meeting (12 February) 2020.

   Fake.
   Microsoft has a marketing deal with EA for Jedi Fallen Order, no way
   that the game will show up at a State of Play episode. Also, the May
   2020 release date for TLOU2 makes no sense at all, I mean, every single
   leak it's pointing towards a February release.

   I wouldn't find it strange if Ghost of [insert name here] becomes their
   franchise.
   Given the time and money being spent and reboot and what's not we are
   hearing to meet next-gen standards* it doesn't strike me as a one off
   project.
   More so with larger and probably more dynamic worlds being possible
   with the upcoming generation, the market has space for something like
   that because all other rendition (to my knowledge) have a western
   theme.

   Maybe they still don't have any new studio. Or if they have it, they
   may still not have a name.

   I think it will happen either at the Playstation Meeting on February
   12th 2020.
   (to present the studies that are working on new games for the new
   console)
   Or directly to E3 2020.

   Yeah, they had great gameplay. The quest design was far too bland and
   got worse as the series went on, but playing it was awesome. SP is a
   fantastic and underrated studio, I hope they don't fuck up their great
   catalogue by making Ghost of Sushi a walk 'em-up bonding simulator.

   I don't understand these companies who won't delay their games to have
   better launch titles for their new systems, even 1 year in advance. I
   don't know, must be unreasonable, but it's definitely the culprit as to
   why the PS4's launch lineup sucked, imagine if they had TLOU and Gran
   Turismo 6 as launch titles for the PS4.
   I'm predicting smaller, more VR-oriented announcements during this
   event, no PSX, and a megaton E3 next year.

   It wouldn't be exclusive to PS5, it will still be released on PS4.
   Ghost of tsushima should be a cross gen title.
   It would literally be a 4K/60fps game on PS5 hardware.

   I love the PSVR too, but it is still hurting for the really good games.
   Astrobot is probably the only VR system seller imo. There are other
   really good games like Moss and Tetris Effect, but still not enough.

   Nah thts all opinion. There's over 10 games thts lit imo and well worth
   entry. Firewall, Moss, ASTRO, PSVR Resi Evil, Arizona Sunshine, Beat
   Saber, Blood and Truth,Borderlands VR, Super Hot, Far Point, Rush of
   Blood, Star Trek Bridge crew, etccc
   Idc if not all are exclusives I have played all of these and enjoyed
   them on PSVR and thy were all worth it to me. Every game doesn't have
   to be a Super Mario 64 moment or system seller even though Astrobot Def
   is imo they just need to have a nice package and the support for PSVR
   has been great, again imo.

   I think there is not much correlation in announcing the launch date of
   The Last of Us Part 2 before the release of Death Stranding.
   Because, in any case, both games will have the opportunity to make
   their marketing path in extreme comfort, considering the times taken by
   Sony with the next State of Play on November 1st, and the next
   Playstation Meeting on February 12th 2020.

   Think of the positive side.
   The more time Naughty Dog has to work on The Last of Us Part 2, the
   greater the final quality of the work will be.
   Furthermore, considering that the game will be released in May 2020, it
   can be a great preview of what will await us on the Sony stage for the
   future E3 2020.

   It's not wise take the words of the "insiders" in general for "true".
   (and especially the best known ones)
   For the simple reason that they are the first to be "guided" in
   diverting attention based on various factors.
   (including those of "personal profit" on the credibility given to them)
   For example this:

   I hope PS5 doesn’t launch until late 2021 or 2022. That’s right, you
   heard me. I believe PS4 still has a lot of life left in it. It hasn’t
   fully matured both in price and games.

   PS4 is struggling to run the latest games, you can see that with
   Battlefield V (low res, unstable framerate), Days Gone (unstable
   framerate), Ace Combat 7 (low res, unstable framerate) and many other
   recent releases. Next year the hardware will be pushed beyond it's
   actual limits by games like FF7R (low res) and Cyberpunk 2077 (low res,
   heavily downgraded compared to the enhanced consoles/PC), and while
   titles like TLOU Part II and Ghost of Tsushima are going to look and
   run really well, that would be because those games are First Party
   projects running on engines optimized and built with the strenghts and
   weaknesses of the PS4 hardware in mind.
   Personally I want the PS5 to come out as soon as possible because I'm
   starting to see how we have reached the roof of what the PS4 hardware
   is truly capable of, and beside all of that, I just want to see how
   next-gen games look like (Avatar, EA Motive's new IP, Starfield,
   Horizon 2, the new Gran Turismo, whatever Rocksteady is working on,
   etc).

   As much as I love PS4, the comming of PS5 for 2020 is almost certain.
   Both for the agreements made by Sony with AMD for the chips for the new
   generation, and to counter the arrival of the Xbox Scarlet, which
   Microsoft wants to launch by the end of 2020.
   (and I don't think Sony will leave the field free to Microsoft, in the
   console market)
   Furthermore, the latest exclusive PS4 games coming for 2020 will be
   Medievil, Death Stranding, Final Fantasy VII Remake, The Last of Us
   Part 2, and probably Ghost of Tsushima in cross-gen with PS5.
   And besides these, there are no more new exclusive games for PS4.
   (so it is likely that the new games that will be announced at the
   Playstation Meeting 2020 in February, and at E3 2020, by Sony will be
   new exclusives for the new PS5, such as Horizon Zero Dawn 2)

How much is this computer worth on selling it?
       You need to determine the disk size. According to what I've read,
       it could have a 256, 512, or 768GB SSD in it. Which one is actually
       in there should make a big difference as to the price. Actually
       according to this page if it's the 2.4GHz model, it's probably a
       256GB SSD. Well, it's good to...

Who could be the next company in the console race?
       Samsung. In the late 90s Samsung bought the hardware division of
       3DO Systems, which had a brand new console chipset completed that
       was two generations beyond the original 3DO hardware and a
       generation beyond the not-released M2. The MX hardware was to be
