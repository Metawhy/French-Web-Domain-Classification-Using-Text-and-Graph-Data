Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2153 Synchronous Step-Down Converter

   Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2153 Synchronous Step-Down Converter
   achieves offers 1.5A of continuous output current with excellent load
   and line regulation over a 4V to 36V input supply range. The output
   voltage of the MP2153 can be regulated as low as 0.6V. The Constant On
   Time (COT) control scheme provides fast transient response and eases
   loop stabilization. By using input voltage feed-forward, the MP2153
   maintains a fairly constant switching frequency across the input and
   output voltage ranges.

   Texas Instruments INA185 Current Sense Amplifier is designed for use in
   cost-sensitive space-constrained applications. This device is a
   bidirectional, current-sense amplifier (also called a current-shunt
   monitor). The INA185 senses voltage drop across a current-sense
   resistor at common-mode voltages from –0.2V to +26V, independent of the
   supply voltage. The INA185 integrates a matched resistor gain network
   in four, fixed-gain device options: 20V/V, 50V/V, 100V/V, or 200V/V.
   This matched gain resistor network minimizes gain error and reduces the
   temperature drift.

   The INA185 operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply. The device
   draws a maximum supply current of 260µA and features a high slew rate.
   The INA185 also has a high bandwidth making this device an excellent
   choice for many power-supply and motor-control applications.

Features

     * SOT-563 package (1.6mm×1.6mm)
          + 39% smaller footprint than SC70
          + 0.55mm package height
     * Common-mode range (V[CM]): –0.2V to +26V
     * High bandwidth: 350kHz (A1 devices)
     * Offset voltage
          + ±55µV (max) at V[CM] = 0V
          + ±100µV (max) at V[CM] = 12V (A4 device)
     * Output slew rate: 2V/µs
     * Bidirectional current-sensing capability

     * Accuracy
          + ±0.2% maximum gain error (A1, A2, A3)
          + 0.5µV/°C maximum offset drift
     * Gain options
          + 20V/V (A1 devices)
          + 50V/V (A2 devices)
          + 100V/V (A3 devices)
          + 200V/V (A4 devices)
     * Quiescent current: 260µA (max)

Applications

     * Motor control
     * Battery monitoring
     * Power management

     * Lighting control
     * Overcurrent detection
     * Solar inverters
