Rapper Deem Spencer Makes Music for the Calm Kids

   Interviews Men’s Fashion Music
   By Andrew Matson
   on August 20, 2018

   One of the models in our fall men’s fashion campaign, 22-year-old
   rapper Deem Spencer, has a different angle on hip-hop. In a field known
   for brash extroverts, his songs are notably chill, with main themes of
   “fear, insecurity, being naive.” If you’re unfamiliar with Spencer’s
   music, start with his 2017 album We Think We Alone, which you can hear
   in our video below. Should you like what you hear, stay tuned to his
   SoundCloud and look out for his sixth project.

   Spencer spoke to us about making music for calm kids, his city and his
   journey to his personal style.

Meet Mansur Gavriel: Get to Know the Chic Brand Through Their Theme Songs

   Interviews Style
   By Britt Burritt
   on August 20, 2018

   You never know what chance encounter may change the course of your
   life, so it’s best to always be prepared, dress well and be nice.

   For Rachel Mansur and Floriana Gavriel, the designers behind New
   York-based label Mansur Gavriel, that fateful event occurred in 2010 at
   an xx show. “We began talking to each other as strangers in the lobby
   of the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles,” says Mansur. “We had a very
   quick and striking connection.” Mansur had studied textiles at Rhode
   Island School of Design; Gavriel studied fashion and photography at
   Germany’s University of the Arts Bremen. The two had been living on
   different continents: Mansur in L.A. and Gavriel in Berlin. Their
   meeting resonated with both, even as Gavriel returned to Berlin. “We
   had a shared aesthetic and were in similar stages in life,” Mansur
   says. “We both loved the idea of telling a visual story and were ready
   to start something—and to dream big.”

   Nicole and Brent wed in the quaint port of call of Roche Harbor Resort
   on San Juan Island in Washington State, surrounded by their loved ones
   and the Salish Sea.

   Why did you chose the venue?

   We love the water, the outdoors and the islands around Washington. We
   fell in love with Roche Harbor, and San Juan Island, the first time we
   visited. As we explored options, we knew we wanted an outdoor venue and
   a beautiful place that would showcase the Pacific Northwest not only
   for our local guests but for those traveling … and Roche Harbor was
   just perfect for that.

Menswear Icon Nick Wooster on Sneakers, Style and What Every Man Should Have
in His Closet

   Interviews Men’s Fashion Style
   By Amy Leigh Morgan
   on July 26, 2018

   Mr. Nick Wooster has been called an Internet superhero and the “alpha
   male of American street style.” Some fans even call him Woost God. He’s
   got upward of half a million followers on Instagram, and photographers
   hound him at Fashion Week and Pitti Uomo. It’s safe to say he knows a
   thing or two about style.

   Mr. Wooster can also boast (if he were so inclined) 30 years of
   experience as a fashion director and creative consultant at highbrow
   retailers around the world. So it’s safe to say he knows a thing or two
   about luxury.

   Which is why his new collaboration with Brooklyn-based sneaker company
   GREATS is so exciting. From luxurious Italian craftsmanship to
   Instagram-worthy designs, these bold, playful shoes are made to be
   enjoyed. We caught up with him between promotional appearances for the
   Nick Wooster x GREATS collection to ask him a few questions about
   shoes, style and what every man needs in his closet.

   That fashion is a trade is often downplayed. Most designers of clothing
   and accessories choose to emphasize the artistry of their work, the
   conception, creation and display of their wares. That’s understandable
   and interesting, but so much of the industry involves measuring and
   cutting, skilled workers, factory floors, machinery and supply
   chains—not so sexy but absolutely essential.

   Art and trade are on full display at the 1,000-square-foot studio of
   design darlings Marcela Velez and Melissa Losada of M2Malletier. The
   duo launched their well-received and coveted collection of clearly sexy
   handbags in Barcelona, where they made a home for themselves in a
   pre-World War I cement factory that was renovated by Spanish
   starchitect Ricardo Bofill. The building, called La Fábrica, resembles
   a brutalist Gothic castle—in other words, it’s unlike anything you’ve
   ever seen.

   On Spanish style influencer Gala Gonzalez’s summer agenda: travel to 18
   destinations, eat authentic Mexican food (in Mexico), lots of skin
   moisturizer, and French electro-pop. Throughout this, the Amlul
   blogger will be packing Gala sandals, designed by Pedro García. Her
   namesake shoes are just the latest in an ongoing collaboration between
   Gonzalez and fellow Spaniards Mila and Pedro García. “I have a deep
   personal relationship with them,” Gala says. “Also, I’m truly happy to
   spread a Spanish brand worldwide!” It’s an obvious fit for the
   fashionable brunette beauty who favors comfortable flats and fun times.
   “I feel very identified with their ‘think party, wear daily’
   philosophy,” she says.

   on July 9, 2018

   Try as you might, sometimes you can’t get away. Whether it’s because
   your PTO bank is low or your bank account is, a holiday isn’t always on
   the horizon. When beset by a deficit of vacation days, it’s fun to live
   vicariously through your well-traveled pals.

   This week we’ve been poring over the stunning pics of Nordstrom’s print
   design director, Kim Chin, who just returned from Iceland. We can
   practically feel the chill coming from her cool shots of this Nordic
   land famed for its hospitality, its geologic landscape and for giving
   the world Bjork (takk!). Find out where to dine, stay and swim, plus
   what to pack.

Trish McEvoy’s 5 Steps to Total Skin Fitness

   Beauty Skin Care
   By Emma Zaratian
   on July 2, 2018

   The daily skincare routine. When you’re rushing from here to there,
   juggling life’s demands and falling into bed exhausted at night, it’s
   easy to shrug it off as a theoretically smart but non-essential luxury.
   After all, you did remember to brush your teeth. But we’re here to
   caution you from cutting too many corners. Someone in the skincare
   industry once quipped that you might have a handbag for 10 years, but
   you’ll always have your face. While we love handbags to no end, it’s a
   wise adage that underscores the worth of any skincare investment you
   can afford. Minutes a day now can add years to your skin’s health down
   the road.

   So what’s it take? To get a professional opinion on how to really nail
   your daily skincare routine, we consulted with one of the industry’s
   top makeup artists and skin gurus, Trish McEvoy. Not only is Trish the
   founder of her own beauty line, she and her dermatologist husband,
   Ronald Sherman, opened The Dr. Ronald Sherman/Trish McEvoy Skin Care
   Center in New York together in 1978—and have pioneered a vast amount of
   medi-spa cosmeceutical science since then.

   Trish talks about skin care in terms of ‘fitness’. Skin fitness, like
   that workout routine you may or may not have time for, simply
   translates into an effective daily regimen. But instead of cardio and
   weights, it’s a synergistic five-step routine anyone at any age can
   adopt for healthier, more radiant skin. Ahead, Trish talks us through
   the five essential steps of daily skin care, plus answers a few
   lingering questions we had on the topic.

   We love fanfare. We excel at cheering. We’re pretty great rooting and

   USA Games in Seattle this week, July 1–6, we’ll be doing all those
   things from the stands and the field.

   and individual events and their 50,000 fans this week at the Seattle
   Center and University of Washington. We’ll be there with the delegates
   from all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., clapping in the stands,

   In a springtime ceremony Milan and David tied the knot, Texas style.

   Milan, tell us about the location.

   I knew I wanted to get married somewhere around my hometown of Dallas
   and David has always loved Fort Worth, so it was a perfect fit for us.
   We felt that Fort Worth truly encompassed the spirit of Texas, and we
   wanted all of our friends and family to be able to experience that.

   Our Catholic faith was another thing we really connected on from the
   beginning. The moment we laid eyes on St. Patrick Cathedral downtown,
   we decided that this was the spot where we wanted to be married. Our
   reception was an even easier decision. Right in the heart of downtown
   Fort Worth is Reata restaurant. They offer delicious Southern cooking
   and they have this gorgeous two-level roof with a glass, domed dining
   room that is pure magic at night. We spent the evening dancing under
   the Texas stars with all of our closest family and friends.
