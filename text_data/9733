   Acorus Networks

   Acorus Networks protects your networks and applications from DoS and
   DDoS attacks. By attacking Scoop.it in April 2014, the hacker enabled
   Marc Rougier to meet Acorus Networks – very early – and now invest with
   Elaia Partners. The cofounders of Acorus Networks, Raphael, Benjamin
   and Olivier are amongst the few people you feel that you can trust by
   the end of the first meeting.
