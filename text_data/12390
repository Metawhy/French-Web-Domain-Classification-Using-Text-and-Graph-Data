   10 Color Word Books

10 Color Word Books

   By Crystal McGinnis 10:25 AM
     __________________________________________________________________

     Color words are included in almost every kindergarten curriculum!
   Kindergarten students read them, spell them, and write them! When
   teaching color words, I try to expose the kiddos to them as much as
   possible. One way I do this is by incorporating color words into small
   group reading sessions. We use these color word books during small
   group, and then we place them in our book boxes to use as a familiar
   read later. These books are perfect for teaching color words, sight
   words, tracking print, text features, context clues and more. When
   creating these books, I tried to keep them very predictable for new
   readers at the beginning of the school year. They all follow a
   predictable pattern, and incorporate the given color word on each page.
   If you would like to use these in your classroom, they are available in
   my Teacher Pay Teachers store. They are incredibly easy to print and
   staple. No sorting needed! I created them so that they print 3 books
   with each set to save paper.

   Songs for Teaching Kids How to Take Care of School Supplies

Songs for Teaching Kids How to Take Care of School Supplies

   By Crystal McGinnis 5:19 AM
     __________________________________________________________________

   Do your kids love to sing as much as mine do? Songs are a perfect way
   to teach skills in your classroom. Your kids will pick them up quickly,
   and they can learn so much from them! I wrote these "school supply"
   songs to teach kinders the proper way to care for their school
   supplies. I wrote songs for glue, crayons, pencils, and scissors. I
   tried to incorporate as many "rules" into the songs as I could.
   Hopefully these songs will help the kids throughout the year. All of
   the songs are sung to the tune of "I'm a Little Teapot." You can grab
   these songs for FREE in my tpt store by clicking the link below. I hope
   your kids love them!

   Alphabet Poems for Shared Reading

Alphabet Poems for Shared Reading

   By Crystal McGinnis 2:02 PM
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am always looking for new ways to introduce the letters of the
   alphabet! I use anchor charts, centers, songs, digital games, books,
   play-doh, and almost every other kind of manipulative that I can to
   make those alphabet letters and sounds stick. A couple of years ago, I
   observed an amazing teacher modeling shared reading during a
   professional development day. It was at that moment that I decided,
   shared reading would be the perfect way to not only introduce the
   letters of the alphabet, but also help those new readers develop
   phonemic awareness, understand concepts of print, be exposed to
   rhyming, and so much more! I sat down one quiet Sunday afternoon, and
   started writing these alphabet poems for shared reading. It was my goal
   to write one for each letter of the alphabet, and then let my kinders
   create a poetry notebook with all of the poems included. I am happy to
   say that I was able to get this accomplished. (Some of those letters
   were tough!) Now that they are complete, we will add a poem to our
   poetry notebook each week as we focus on a new letter. I will also keep
   these displayed in the classroom so that they can be used as a
   reference by the kiddos. If you would like to use these poems in your
   classroom, follow this link to get the printable version.

   10 Pattern Centers for Kindergarten

10 Pattern Centers for Kindergarten

   By Crystal McGinnis 5:47 PM
     __________________________________________________________________

   Morning Math Tubs are a great way to keep your kiddos busy while you
   are taking care of attendance, lunch count, and those other morning
   tasks that need your attention. I created this set of morning math
   tubs, or math centers, to use at the beginning of the school year when
   patterns are introduced. This set includes 10 math tubs, with 10
   separate patterning activities. I tried to include math manipulatives
   that most kindergarten classes have such as teddy bear counters,
   pattern blocks, linking chains, and more. I also created them in BLACK
   OR WHITE to save ink. Check them out below. If you want to use them in
   your classroom, click this link to get them.
   [20190702_141210.jpg]
    Teddy Bear Patterns
   The kiddos create patterns, and extend patterns using teddy bear
   counters.
   [20190702_142209.jpg]
   Number Patterns
   Students extend patterns using numbered clothespins.
   [20190702_143139.jpg]
   Pattern Block Patterns
   The kids create and extend patterns using pattern blocks.
   [20190702_142935.jpg]
   Linking Chain Patterns
   Students create linking chain patterns, and extend them using colored
   linking chains.
   [20190702_143644.jpg]
   Pattern Clip-It
   Students complete each pattern by clipping the missing picture.
   [20190702_143958.jpg]
   People Patterns
   Students complete each pattern card by placing the correct missing
   person in each box.
   [20190702_144712.jpg]
   Unifix Cube Patterns
   The kiddos create and extend colored patterns using unifix cubes. They
   create ab, abb, aab, and abc patterns.
   [20190702_145323.jpg]
   Pattern Mats
   Students use these pattern mats to create patterns using manipulatives
   of their choice, such as pom poms! These could be used with target
   erasers or any other counters. Whatever small counters you have on hand
   would work!
   [20190702_145927.jpg]
   Play-doh Patterns
   The kiddos create and mimic patterns using play-doh.
   [20190702_151305.jpg]
   Popsicle Stick Patterns
   Students match pattern cards, and then create the pattern with popsicle
   sticks. I colored the popsicle sticks with marker, but crayons would
   work. It was simple!

   Color Word Poems for Shared Reading

Color Word Poems for Shared Reading

   By Crystal McGinnis 6:29 AM
     __________________________________________________________________

   Do you teach color words in kindergarten? If you do, poetry is a
   perfect way to make those color words stick! Each year, I create a
   color words poetry journal with 11 color word poems. As we learn how to
   spell and write each color word, we also learn a new poem from the
   journal. In each poem, we highlight the color words and color the
   pictures of each "colored object."
   After reading them several times, we use these poems during our guided
   reading sessions as a familiar read. We also use them as a resource for
   writing because they are filled with words we know.
   Sometimes I write the color word poems on chart paper, and we display
   the poem for the kiddos to use as a resource. You are welcome to use
   these poems in your classroom! If you want a copy of the poems in the
   poetry notebook, click here to get them in my tpt store.

   Ocean Animals

Ocean Animals

   By Crystal McGinnis 6:06 AM
     __________________________________________________________________

   One of my favorite units to teach during the school year is the Ocean!
   I usually teach this unit at the end of the school year right before
   summer break. The kids LOVE learning about ocean animals, and it is a
   great way to keep them engaged all the way up to the end of school when
   they are more difficult to keep focused. I am going to share with you
   some of the activities that we complete during our study of the ocean.
   They are all available in my Ocean Unit on TPT.
   [20190410_174337.jpg]
   We begin our ocean unit with a focus on ocean animals. We focus on one
   ocean animal each day. I love to develop my kids' prior knowledge by
   completing this "What We Already Know" chart. The kids write one fact
   about the ocean animal on a sticky note and add it to the chart. We
   then look at each sticky note and talk about what they wrote.
   [Ocean%2B7.jpg]
    I then introduce that animal using these nonfiction animal slides. The
   kids stay really engaged when I project the images as we discuss the
   ocean animal information.
   [Ocean%2B2.jpg]
   [Slide3.JPG]
   We then complete a Can/Have/Are chart as a class. This is a great way
   to organize our newly learned information. We keep this displayed to
   use during our writing projects.
   [Ocean.jpg]
   After completing the chart, we color and read the ocean animal book
   that matches the animal we are studying. These books provide more
   information about each ocean animal. These books are in a  "teacher
   led" format, but the kiddos still love them!
   [20190410_174150.jpg]
   After we read our ocean animal book for the day, we complete some
   additional activities that include reading, writing, labeling,
   organizing, and more!
   [20190410_174817.jpg]
   [Ocean%2B4.jpg]
   Each day during our ocean unit, we will sing an ocean animal themed
   song. We will also create an ocean themed craft to match the animal we
   are learning about that day. Here is an example of the shark craft and
   song!
   [20190410_192409.jpg]
   [20190410_174551.jpg]
   I like to display the song on the projector to create a "shared
   reading" experience.
   [Ocean%2B3.jpg]
   [20190410_175031.jpg]
   Here are some of the additional activities that we complete during our
   2 week ocean unit!
   Sea Turtle Research Project
   [Ocean%2B8.jpg]
   Ocean Animal Writing Book
   [Ocean%2B10.jpg]
   Shark Labeling Activity

   If you would like to use my Ocean Animal Unit in your classroom, you
   can grab it here. You can stretch this unit out over a 2 week period. I
   hope your kids love it!
