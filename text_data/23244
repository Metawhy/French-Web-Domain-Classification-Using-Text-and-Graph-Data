   Welcome to the webpage of the thematic trimester combi17. The trimester
   has now started.

Program of the next weeks

     * March 28th - March 29th: last lectures of Nicolas Orantin and Don
       Zagier: see the planning and detail.
     * Thursday, March 30th: Séminaire Flajolet.

   How to find IHP?.

   Below you'll find the complete timeline of the trimester and more
   general information. The links in the right column give more
   information on all the events.

Videos/slides of the lectures

   The courses (except the one of Zagier) during the trimester and the
   introductory school are recorded. See here.

   Here are also the slides of the first and third lecture of Alexey
   Bufetov on Integrable Probability.

Themes

   The main goal of this trimester is to give to researchers in
   combinatorics the opportunity to meet and work together. More
   precisely, we aim at gathering people from the three following wide
   themes:
     * Asymptotic representation theory,
     * Random maps, Dimer models,
     * Enumerative geometry and moduli spaces.

   These three fields share some common features either via the objects
   they study or the techniques they involve and some collaborations
   already exist. But we feel that the three communities will benefit from
   more exchanges and hope that the trimester will reinforce the already
   existing links and foster new deep interactions.
   The trimester includes:
     * An introductory winter school in CIRM near Marseille
     * Three international workshops,
     * Graduate and research courses
     * Weekly graduate and research seminars
     * Outreach activities

   and will host many scientists for long and short visits.

Other activities on related topics in Paris

     February 2nd-March 23rd : master course "Analytic combinatorics and
   applications" by Timothy Budd in Orsay.
