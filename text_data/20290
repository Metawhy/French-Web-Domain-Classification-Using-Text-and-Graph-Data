   Alternative to Slack

Alternative to Slack

   Mattermost is an open source Slack alternative. It's written in Golang
   and React and runs as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   Use the features you like (file sharing, real-time group chat and
   webhooks—to name a few) and access the source code.

   Mattermost vs. Microsoft Teams

Mattermost vs. Microsoft Teams

   For engineers, modern collaboration means more than just group chat.
   While Microsoft Teams can meet the needs of some business users who
   need a simple chat solution, developers need the power to connect
   services, proprietary systems, and complex workflows without limiting
   their autonomy.

   Migrate from Hipchat

Migrate from Hipchat

   Organizations are migrating from Hipchat, IRC and Rocket.Chat to
   Mattermost. After Slack acquired Hipchat, customers searched for open
   source alternatives. And Mattermost became the leading choice for
   on-premises Atlassian customers.
