   Learn more about us

Why you need Search Engine Optimization for your online business

   There are many ways to generate traffic and especially visits by
   potential customers, some involve paying for each visit (pay per click
   or referral). This might be a valid short term solution but without
   doubt, the long term strategy involving the highest return on
   investment (ROI), is aiming for free traffic coming from search
   engines. Search engine optimization, also known as SEO, is the process
   of getting traffic from the “free”, “organic” and “natural” listings on
   search engines. These listings (SERPs) are the results that a search
   engine will return to a user who has entered a query based on a
   specific set of terms (keywords). All major search engines such
   as Google, Yahoo and Bing offer these results, where web pages and
   other content such as videos or local listings are shown and ranked
   based on what the search engine considers most relevant to users. In
   this case, if your website appears in the first pages of the search
   engines’ results, the more chances you have of obtaining free traffic.

            Dear Wendy,
            Thank you for your email and for your interest in our company.
            We can definitely help your client establish an online
            presence in Vietnam by helping him reach out and connect with
            potential clients here.
            Please find attached an introduction to our services and our
            fee schedule.
            In regards to the language your client will want to use to
            address potential clients, we can work both in English and/or
            Vietnamese. A project really depends on the language used so
            if you wish to roll-out a campaign in two languages, we will
            consider these as two projects in terms of fees even though we
            can report and manage both simultaneously.
            We can also help with building a Vietnamese language website
            or translating your client’s current website.

INTRODUCTION AND PRICING, 6th of December 2014 Golden Speed SEO
            At Golden Speed Seo, our vision of SEO is not exclusively
            about achieving good rankings for our customers. Good rankings
            are definitely a target in the mid and longterm but to focus
            exclusively on rankings is not a sustainable tactic in 2014.
            Our entire SEO process is designed around getting your website
            the maximum exposure possible. We guarantee in-depth work on a
            regular basis that encompasses a wide range of tasks such as,
            just to name a few:
            * building your website’s authority within its industry, this
            will make your website appear as more relevant among your
            online competitors
            * working on a variety of dimensions related to inbound
            marketing so you maximize the value of each visit to your
            website
            * creating great content so that your site is linked to and
            shared in social media as best as possible (G+, Facebook,
            Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, etc.)
            * link building based on quality and relevance, forging
            alliances with industry related blogs and websites
            * our experience with e-commerce websites as well as with
            marketplaces (ebay, amazon) and market comparison bots (Google
            products, etc.) can be a valuable asset, depending on your
            sales model
            Our SEO and online marketing campaigns generally include three
            stages. The first two are one-time actions that we strongly
            recommend you implement before moving towards the ongoing
            monthly SEO service and if necessary a specific Content
            Management
            service.

Website Audit (not mandatory but recommended to ensure the foundations of
your online campaign are rock solid)
            To be carried out at the very beginning of the SEO campaign.
            We will carry out a comprehensive review not only of your
            website (architecture, on-page content, url structure,
            internal linking, html, redirects, etc.) but also of its
            presence online (link
            profile, traffic sources, competitors, etc.).
            We will deliver a complete report that will include actions
            and recommendations described clearly for your website to have
            a solid foundation before any other SEO work is carried out.

Keyword and competitor analysis (recommended)
            We carry out an in-depth search related to your industry and
            target audience to detect the opportunities that exist and
            define the most profitable targets for your SEO campaign. An
            analysis of your main competitors is also carried out to
            detect the main keywords that
            they are competing for.

On-going SEO monthly campaign
            * continued changing of meta-tags to improve CTR, adapt to
            your marketing campaigns or seasonal trends
            * advice on how to create useful and memorable content.
            Different techniques are evaluated (info-graphs, guides, etc.)
            depending on whether the purpose is to generate leads or
            create link bait, or both.
            * link-building based exclusively on creating a natural
            link-profile through industry/topic
            related incoming links that are contextual and relevant.
            * using social media to market your content and create
            positive “social signals” for search engines to pick-up
            (please note this is not an SMO campaign)
            Content management Services (can be combined with SEO or
            contracted independently)
            * we will manage content creation on our client’s blog and
            implement it directly on the CMS in order to optimize it for
            search engines
            * all the content created for our client’s blog will be
            marketed accordingly across a wide spectrum of platforms
            * creating an industry specific library by compiling data from
            external sources
            * identifying different platforms (forums, discussion groups)
            where client’s in-house staff can contribute and participate
            to create brand awareness, we can also participate on client’s
            behalf
            * surveillance of traffic analytics and update of meta tags
            (titles, descriptions) to improve click through ratio
            Based on the guidelines of our clients we can provide high
            quality articles for your own blog (if applicable) or for
            posting in other blogs and website. We do require a constant
            flow of raw material from our clients such as photos, videos
            and other factual information
            related to the production of the goods that they sell or
            services they provide. Our monthly packages are not based on
            volume (how many directory submission, how many articles
            published, how many social posts, etc.) but rather on the time
            we will spend
            on your campaign each month.
            For optimal results and especially if the niche is a technical
            one (i.e.: iris recognition, law, mechanics, programming,
            etc.), the contribution of in-house staff can make a huge
            impact and we will guide them to optimize their social
            presence and industry leadership
            recognition (specialized forums, linkedin groups, etc.).
            We will also be your in-house counsel for all SEO and online
            marketing related questions, we communicate extensively with
            our clients throughout our collaboration.

            Hello Kevin, here is an essential tip when blog commenting. I
            really recommend you spend time reading a post before adding a
            comment. Make sure your comment provides added value to the
            discussion or article, even if you are only asking a question.
            Make it clear you have read the content and are really
            interested by it.
            You must avoid at all costs, the typical, standard, copy/paste
            comments that will not get you any do-follow links but just
            irritate webmasters.
            Remember, your signature and the link behind it is something
            (website, agency, company) you are trying to promote so if you
            are promoting link-building or seo services (in Vietnam or
            elsewhere), the quality of your comment will tell potential
            customers about the quality of your work (on-topic and
            engaging comments for SEO). If they are just bad comments, who
            would want to hire someone for link-building?
            Cheers

            Hello, this is a relatively simple structured SEO blog written
            for all those seeking to learn a bit more about online
            marketing and search engine optimization, especially for our
            niche clients within Vietnam.
            What you will need when creating a blog is that you must have
            a passion about your main topic, be it SEO, SEM, online
            marketing or pet shampoo. If you try promoting your blog by
            commenting on other blogs, I suggest you try to make engaging
            comments which will come naturally if you are interested in
            the particular topic of those blogs.

       site? I’m getting fed up of WordPress because I’ve had issues with

            Hello, it is fairly easy to check as you can see at the bottom
            right of any page on this site that it is powered by
            WordPress. It remains a good platform with many SEO plugins
            that can do a great job or, if you’re not careful, overdo the
            job (Google Penguin will not appreciate over-optimization).
            If you’re worried about spam, you won’t be able to stop
            receiving spammy messages (like some of the ones here which we
            have approved but removed the associated links) but you
            certainly will reduce the number by using anti-spam plugins.
            We use Spam Free WordPress by Todd Lahman, great job Todd!
            This being said, the amount of people that post 0 added value
            comments thinking that in 2012 you can get a do-follow link is
            still amazing especially since most of them are supposedly
            selling SEO services and other online marketing services….I’m
            worried for their clients.

            Hi there, I recommend creating an RSS feed (widgets are
            available for WordPress) and then associating it with your
            Twitter account. You have many many ways to automatically
            tweet your new posts. Another in-house favorite is scoop.it, a
            great tool for curating any topic and then distributing out
            via your twitter and facebook accounts.

            Yes absolutely. Text spinning is out of date and link-building
            as many were doing is gone for good. SEO is undergoing a huge
            transformation and only those that can adapt will be able to
            provide positive ROI to their customers and their online
            marketing strategy.
            Those that rely on old and obsolete, black or grey hat
            techniques are out of the picture and frankly, I’m happy to
            see them go.

       There are various SEO services providing different results, but all
       of them require to focus on Internet keywords as their leading
       factor. It’s only with this initial step of discovering the
       Internet keywords that SEO services could lead websites toward the
       right destinations. Otherwise, the entire SEO efforts will be in

            That’s very true. Many clients tend to overlook this essential
            task that should be carried out as one of the initial steps of
            any SEO campaign.
            Identifying the most relevant target keywords for your landing
            pages must be done with a methodical approach.
            This will save you time and money in your SEM and PPC
            campaigns (Adwords) by improving your click-through ratio
            (CTR) and reducing the bounce rate so you will improve your
            overall quality score and your cost-per-click (CPC).
            In all aspects of online marketing and especially SEO where
            all efforts are set out around target keywords, choosing the
            right keywords is an essential ingredient for success.
            Knowledge of your target audience, their habits and interests
            will vary from one region or country to another is only one
            part of a thorough keyword analysis. You must then perform an
            in-depth analysis of statistical data (Google Analytics and
            Google Adwords data) in order to confirm some prospects and
            identify new opportunities regarding keywords and potential
            traffic generation.
            This is one reason why, for example, SEO Vietnam can only be
            done by savvy local experts that understand exactly how a
            Vietnamese person will carry out his surfing and search on the
            internet. The same applies to other countries and regions.

            Chào bạn,
            Rất vui vì bạn đã quan tâm tới trang web của chúng tôi. Sau
            đây là các nội dung về dịch vụ SEO của chúng tôi mà bạn muốn
            tìm hiểu:
            Dịch vụ SEO Vietnam chất lượng cao tại Việt Nam dành cho khách
            hàng địa phương và quốc tế
            Những công ty lớn và nhỏ đều cần sự hiện diện trên mạng để
            giao tiếp với khách hàng và đặc biệt là để có thêm nhiều khách
            hàng hơn nữa.
            Để đạt được điều này, việc tạo ra một internet site mới chỉ là
            bước đầu tiên. Ngay trước khi bạn thiết lập site của mình, bạn
            phải trả lời câu hỏi sau:
            Làm cách nào mà bạn có thể tăng cơ hội được tìm thấy trên
            internet bởi những khách hàng tiềm năng đang tìm kiếm những
            sản phẩm và/hoặc dịch vụ của bạn?
            Đây chính là nơi marketing trực tuyến làm nên khác biệt giữa
            sự thành công và thất bại trong việc kinh doanh trực tuyến của
            bạn.
            Để hiện diện trên internet và đạt được traffic chất lượng từ
            những người thật sự tìm kiếm sản phẩm và/hoặc dịch vụ của bạn,
            bạn cần phải phát triển một chiến lược marketing trực tuyến.
            Có rất nhiều cách để tạo lưu lượng người ghé thăm trang web,
            đặc biệt là sự viếng thăm của những khách hàng tiềm năng, bao
            gồm việc trả tiền cho mỗi chuyến viếng thăm (pay per click
            hoặc tương tự). Điều này có thể là một giải pháp có hiệu quả
            ngắn hạn nhưng có một điều không thể nghi ngờ là chiến lược
            dài hạn liên quan đến việc thu hồi lại vốn đầu tư cao nhất
            (ROI) đang tập trung vào lượng traffic miễn phí từ những công
            cụ tìm kiếm.
            Tối ưu hóa công cụ tìm kiếm (SEO) là quá trình thu thập lưu
            lượng người truy cập trang web từ những danh sách “miễn phí”,
            “cơ bản” và “tự nhiên” trên công cụ tìm kiếm. Những danh sách
            này (SERPs) là những kết quả mà một công cụ tìm kiếm sẽ trả về
            cho người đã nhập câu hỏi dựa trên một tập hợp từ cụ thể (từ
            khóa). Tất cả những công cụ tìm kiếm chủ yếu như Google, Yahoo
            và Bing đưa ra những kết quả này, nơi các trang web và nội
            dung khác như videos hay danh sách cục bộ được đưa ra và xếp
            hạng dựa trên những gì mà công cụ tìm kiếm nghĩ là liên quan
            nhiều nhất đến người dùng. Trong trường hợp này, nếu website
            của bạn xuất hiện ở những trang đầu trong các kết quả của
            những công cụ tìm kiếm, bạn sẽ có thêm nhiều cơ hội đạt được
            lượng traffic miễn phí.
            Golden Speed SEO là một công ty SEO chuyên nghiệp sẽ nỗ lực
            giúp cho trang web của bạn đạt được thứ hạng cao trong những
            kết quả của các công cụ tìm kiếm với những thuật ngữ tìm kiếm
            có liên quan. Điều đó sẽ khiến các vị khách đang tìm kiếm
            những sản phẩm và dịch vụ tương tự của công ty bạn tìm đến với
            bạn.
            Chúng tôi chỉ sử dụng những phương pháp đúng đắn và cập nhật
            nhất để quảng bá website của bạn. Đội ngũ quản lý của chúng

            Hello Ajay,
            Thanks for inquiring about our SEO services in Vietnam. We
            provide both SEO (search engine optimization) and SMO (social
            media optimization) services in Vietnam and abroad for local
            and international clients.
            We have native speaking staff in English, French, Spanish and
            of course Vietnamese.
            European management and skilled local staff are our main
            assets. We regularly update our knowledge, for example, last
            month our SEO Director was in Europe following an advanced SEO
            course for SEO professionals, delivered by a top-notch French
            SEO agency. Refreshing and updating our skills is not a matter
            we take lightly.
            We aim to provide services comparable to European firms. Using
            only manual methods, we work with quality and not quantity
            (number of back links or submissions for example). We do not
            aim to compete with local or regional cheap SEO services and
            other fishy practices (top spot guaranteed in x months, etc.).
            Our services and fees are tailor made so I would need to know
            about your customer’s site (size, language, etc.).
            We provide three main services in SEO:
            1) Site audit : fees depend entirely on the size of the site 
            leads to on-page optimization recommendations
            2) Keyword and competition analysis and suggestions
            3) Off-page SEO
            Regarding off-page SEO, for your project in Vietnam, we also
            target local social media that are used locally as well as
            PR/article distribution.
            We put effort into indexing each backlink and even promoting
            tier-2 links.
            In all the packages, the customer supplies the raw material
            (content) or we can also subcontract it at additional cost for
            the client.
            We already use platforms like Squidoo, and Digg-like sites for
            our off-page SEO. So what you provide as SMO, we include in
            our SEO.
            We can create and maintain social media profiles (SMM, social
            media marketing Vietnam).
            It seems our package composition is not the same as yours so
            it is not easy to deliver comparable costs to what you offer
            on your site.
            Basically your SEO+SMO = our SEO.
            This list is what we won’t include based on your own package
            list:
            -keyword research is included in our site audit and
            competition analysis
            -on-page SEO for the whole site is not included but we can
            agree to optimiz the target landing pages (title tags, images,
            etc.).
            -we do not work on quantity and submit everything manually so
            no “100 directory submissions per month” performance
            criteria…do not worry on this, we do a great job.
            -the email, chat and phone support (which we can of course
            offer too) has to be determined based on the project, we
            cannot quote it without more details. Do you mean this support
            is for customers of the client or for the client to call/email
            his questions about our SEO services? If it is the latter, for
            sure, email support would be included in the fees already.
            -any technical intervention on client’s site (installing
            Google Analytics, CSS, etc.) can be done but at additional
            cost (we can get competitive fees here).
            If you are looking to establish a partnership with the number
            one SEO agency in Vietnam, Golden Speed SEO is the right
            choice. We have answered with more details via email.

            Hello James, thanks for your interest in our services.
            We provide a comprehensive and complete SEO strategy for our
            clients, well beyond link building.
            We can deliver a complete and in-depth analysis of your
            website (on-page optimisation, site structure, siloing,
            technical criteria, etc.).
            Keyword and competitor analysis is another step you must carry
            out with great care before launching a link-building campaign.
            Finally, link building within a broader and varied off-page
            SEO strategy will be carried out providing a diverse and solid
            link profile that will give your landing pages the required
            relevance and authority for search engines to rank them well
            in SERPs (results pages).
            We do of course provide link building as a service without
            carrying out the previous steps mentioned above if our
            customer has already done them. We work with unique, fresh and
            original content, all submissions are done manually and we do
            not spam the internet or link from bad neighbourhoods so as to
            provide a link profile that will provide positive rankings in
            the long term for our clients.
            Quick and speedy results based on black-hat techniques are
            totally excluded from our methods. We have worked on projects
            where he have had to ‘clean up’ our customers’ profiles after
            they had employed ‘cheap and quick’ results link builders… The
            key to success in SEO is quality links (in-context, with
            added-value and from authority sites) and not quantity
            (counting links is a mistake from our point of view).
            Our prices will be based on your keywords, your competition
            and the general timeframe you will target.
            We specialise in English, French and Spanish SEO but we can
            carry out projects in any language.
