Ableton AG - Privacy Information

   Ableton AG, Schönhauser Allee 6-7, D-10119 Berlin herewith informs you
   about the processing of personal data for which Ableton is responsible
   in the sense of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

   Apart from sending us a letter, you may contact us at any time via
   privacy[at]ableton[dot]com
   You can reach our data protection officer by sending an e-mail to
   AbletonDSB[at]daspro[dot]de or by sending a letter to Ableton DSB,
   daspro GmbH, Kurfürstendamm 21, 10719 Berlin.

   Below we have compiled the most important information on typical data
   processing for you, broken down by groups of data subjects. For certain
   data processing operations, which only concern specific groups, the
   information requirements are fulfilled separately. Where the term
   "data" is used, only personal data within the meaning of the GDPR are
   meant.
    1. Website Visitors
    2. Newsletter Recipients
    3. Job Candidates
    4. Customers and Respective Contacts
    5. Communication Partners, Artists, Externals
    6. Rights of Data Subjects and Further Information
    7. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")

1. Website Visitors

   1.1 Server protocol data
   Our web server processes a series of data for each request, which your
   browser automatically transmits to our web server. This data comprises
   the IP address currently assigned to your device, the date and time of
   the request, the time zone, the specific page or file called up, the
   http status code and the amount of data transferred. Additionally, the
   website from which your request came, the browser used, the operating
   system of your end device and the set language. The web server uses
   this data to display the contents of this website in the best possible
   way on your device.

   1.2 Web analysis with Google Analytics
   This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google
   Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files
   placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the
   site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
   website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored
   there. IP anonymization is activated for this website, meaning Google
   will shorten your IP address within the European Union or in another
   contracting state to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only
   in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a
   Google server in the USA and shortened there.

   Google will use this information as a processor according to Art. 28
   GDPR to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the
   website activities and to provide the website’s operator with further
   services connected with the use of the website and the internet. The IP
   address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics
   is not merged with other Google data.

   You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings
   on your browser. You can prevent Google from collecting the data
   generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website
   (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by
   downloading and installing the available browser plug-in.

   1.3 Web analysis with Google AdWords
   This website uses Google AdWords conversion tracking, another Google
   analysis service. Google AdWords uses temporary cookies that are stored
   on your computer for a short time when you click on an Ableton ad. The
   information generated by the cookie about your use of this website
   after the advertisement has been clicked is usually transferred to a
   Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this
   information as a contractually designated processor pursuant to Art. 28
   GDPR to evaluate your use of the website after the advertisement has
   been clicked and to compile reports on these website activities.

   1.4 Web analysis with Crazy Egg
   This website uses Crazy Egg, a web analysis service of Crazy Egg, Inc.
   ("Crazy Egg"). A cookie analyses your user behavior (especially your
   clicks) on our websites. The information generated by the cookie about
   your click behavior on our websites is usually transferred to a Crazy
   Egg server in the USA. You can object to the use of Crazy Egg at any
   time.

   1.5 The purpose of data processing is to present Ableton AG on the
   internet and to communicate with job candidates, interested parties,
   customers and business partners. The purpose of evaluating user
   behavior on the website is to design the website in line with their
   requirements.

   1.6 The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR (contract of
   use for the website). The legal basis for the analysis of user behavior
   is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest, namely the demand-oriented
   design of the website).

   1.7 Protocol and communication data will not be transferred to third
   parties unless special circumstances have arisen. If a criminal offence
   is suspected or in the course of an investigation, data may be
   transferred to the police and the public prosecutor's office. We use
   service providersfor the provision of our services by way of
   commissioned data processing, in particular for the provision,
   maintenance and servicing of IT systems.

   1.8 IP addresses are anonymized after 24 hours at the latest.
   Pseudonymous user data is deleted after a period of six months.

   1.9 The use of the website is not possible without disclosure of
   personal data, such as the IP address. Communication via the website
   without providing data is not possible. The use of the website is also

   (legitimate interest, namely advertising). The legal basis for the
   transfer of payment information to payment providers is Article 6 (1)

   4.3 Banks and payment providers may be recipients of data for the
   processing of payments and credit worthiness checks. In individual
   cases, data may be transferred to debt collection service providers,
   lawyers and courts. We also use service providers for the provision of
   our services by way of commissioned data processing, in particular for
   the provision, maintenance and servicing of IT systems.

   a period of ten calendar years after the contract’s end in accordance

   (legitimate interest, namely communication with contact persons
   relevant to the contract) and Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR (statutory
   obligations, in particular tax and commercial law provisions) apply. If
   just communication concerned, the legal basis is Article 6(1) (f) GDPR
   (legitimate interest, namely documentation of communication processes).

   5.3 Contact and contract data can be transmitted to other service
   providers, business partners as well as offices and authorities if
   necessary for the execution of the contract or order. We also use
   service providers for the provision of our services by way of

   long as we are not bound by legal obligations that require or allow us
   to continue processing your data.

   6.5 If the applicable legal requirements are met, you can request a
   restriction to the processing of your personal data.

   6.6 You have the right to object to the processing, insofar as the data
   processing is based on profiling or direct marketing purposes.

   6.7 If the processing is carried out on the basis of the weighing of
   interests, you may object to the processing by stating reasons arising
   from your particular situation.

   6.8 If the data processing takes place on the basis of your consent or
   a contract, you have the right to a transfer of the data provided by
   you, insofar as the rights and freedoms of others are thereby not
   impaired.

   6.9 If we process your data on the basis of a declaration of consent,
   you have the right to revoke this consent at any time with future
   effect. The processing carried out prior to a revocation remains
   unaffected by the revocation.

   6.10 Moreover, you have the right to file a complaint at any time with
   a data protection supervisory authority, if you believe that data
   processing has been carried out in violation of the applicable law.

   children under 13 years without containing verifiable consent from
