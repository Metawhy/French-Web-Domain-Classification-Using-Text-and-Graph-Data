    Hertz at Wellington

   As New Zealand?s capital city, Wellington is a bustling harbour city.
   With countless cultural attractions, beautiful scenery and fine food,
   there?s really no wonder why Wellington is such a robust travel
   destination.
   Although Wellington?s Downtown is quite compact, it certainly doesn?t
   miss the mark where attractions are involved. The mixture of
   architecture here makes Wellington truly unique ? from 19th century
   cottages to Art Deco inspired buildings ? this city has it all. If
   you?re really looking to immerse yourself in New Zealand?s culture,
   hire a car in Wellington and drive out to the southeast side of the
   city.

   The beautiful region of Wairarapa is located an hour?s drive north of
   Wellington. This is a rural part of New Zealand which offers travellers
   a more off the beaten track tourist experience. Have a drive out on the
   coastal roads through to Cape Palliser ? here you can enjoy the
   panoramic views while watching the seal colonies. There are so many
   hidden gems in this region of New Zealand, The Putangirua Pinnacles are
   some of the best examples of badlands erosion in the country. If you?re

    Hertz at Christchurch Airport

   Christchurch is the largest city in New Zealand's South Island, and
   values nature as well as urban development. The region is filled with
   dramatic views, botanical gardens and beautiful beaches. One of the
   main civic hubs of Christchurch is the pleasant Cathedral Square, home
   of the imposing Christchurch Cathedral; here you'll find some equally
   pleasant dwellings around the banks of the meandering Avon River.

    Show More

   If you're considering hiring a car from Christchurch Airport, you'll
   approach the city from the west, encountering landmarks like Hagley
   Gardens and the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. Major attractions like
   the Christchurch Gondolas are in driving distance from the airport.
   Christchurch has one of the most diverse sets of attractions in New
   Zealand. The Botanic Gardens and Hagley Park contrast nicely with
   modern amenities like Cashel Street - the famous shopping district of
   the city. Cathedral Square provides a glimpse of a far older heritage,
   and Canterbury Museum is a must for anyone interested in New Zealand's
   absorbing history. Those who took up Christchurch Airport car rental
   may wish to make the short drive to the Orana Wildlife Park, or the
   spectacular Christchurch Gondolas. You should also bear in mind, that

Hertz Car Rental Locations

   Please note that from 15 Nov to 15 Apr many cities are required by law
   to restrict the circulation to only vehicles equipped with snow chains
   or winter tyres. For a summary of the orders, please visit
   www.poliziadistato.it. To comply with the regulations, in specific
   locations subject to this requirement, vehicles are equipped with snow
   chains - the price is included in the rental charges through the cost
   of "Winterization Fee". At pick-up if you decide to bring your own snow
   chains or do not intend on driving on the roads subject to this
   requirement, you may decline the equipment by signing the appropriate
   release form. This change will be reflected in the rental charges. For
   more information on the fees, please click here. In all other regions,
   we recommend that you check before renting if your journey includes one
   of the roads subject to this requirement and therefore request the snow
   chains, if necessary.
