Overview

   ADBIS conferences aim to provide a forum where researchers and
   practitioners in the fields of databases and information system can
   interact, exchange ideas and disseminate their accomplishments and
   visions. Inaugurated 19 years ago, ADBIS originally included
   communities from Central and Eastern Europe, however, throughout its
   lifetime it has spread and grown to include participants from many
   other countries throughout the world.

   The ADBIS 2015 conference will be held in Futuroscope/Poitiers in
   France, September 8-11, 2015 and will continue the tradition by
   fostering the growth and providing a platform for researchers and
   practitioners to present their result.

   Organizer of the conference is LIAS/ISAE-ENSMA - Laboratory of Computer
   Science and Automatic Control for Systems.

   The conference will consist of regular sessions with technical
   contributions (regular papers, short papers) reviewed and selected by
   an international program committee, as well as of invited talks and
   tutorials presented by leading scientists. The official language of the
   conference will be English. Doctoral consortium and different Workshops
   will be held in line with the main conference.

   Best Papers of the Main Conference will be invited for submission in
   Special Issues of the following journals (both ISI-indexed Journals).
     * Information Systems, Elsevier
     * International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems

   Best papers of the Workshops will be invited for submission in special
   issues of the following Journal.
     * Information Systems Frontiers, Springer

Why Futuroscope/Poitiers ?

Poitiers and its surroundings: culture and leisure

   Poitiers, a warm and lively city with many narrow alleyways situated
   around its historic university, one of the oldest in Europe. It is a
   favorite stopover for romanesque art lovers who are able to find many
   different reasons to stroll around and discover the town. In the north,
   across the Clain Valley, sports fans will be just as delighted with the
   lake at St-Cyr and the International Welcome Centre which includes a
   wide variety of sports and leisure activities.

Futuroscope: the european park of the moving images

   Just outside Poitiers on a great green plain, futuristic shapes
   puncture the skyline. It's as if all the far-fetched settings from the
   science fiction movies have been beamed down to earth. These are the
   pavilions of Futuroscope and what goes on inside them can be
   breath-taking. You can experience the magic of massive 3D cinema,
   virtual reality simulator rides and the latest in communication
   technologies. There are 22 of the world's largest and most exciting
   visual presentations, ranging from classics like Mount Everest and The
   Grand Canyon to the very latest in dynamic entertainement
   (http://www.futuroscope.com).
