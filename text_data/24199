Introducing...CHICKAPIGLETS!

   Oh my goodness y'all need to sit down for all this cuteness! My friends
   at Chickapig have outdone themselves with this new game...
   CHICKAPIGLETS!!! Just released today & on sale exclusively at Target!
   [IMG-7461.jpg]
   Take it from this mom/kindergarten teacher/dog mom/chicken mom...this
   game is a real HOOT! Brian Calhoun's original CHICKAPIG game is geared
   towards 8+ year-olds. This new game CHICKAPIGLETS was created for a
   little bit younger crowd...4+ year-olds (although older kiddos,
   including myself, enjoy this silly fun also!) It was the perfect game
   for my little "summertime fun day" with this tribe of cuties! Just
   check out this pic... they are all so focused. And the older kiddos
   loved teaching & helping the little guys play!
   [IMG-7463.jpg]
   Okay so here's the scoop on this game. Yes! it is fun...loads of silly
   fun BUT... as a mom & a teacher I'm also looking for those hidden perks
   like "Is it developmentally appropriate? Does it build social skills?
   Is there just one way to play? Does this game reinforce early learning
   skills?" and on and on and on.... And the answer is hands down YES!
   YES! YES! to all of those questions. Here are just a few of the things
   I love about Brian Calhoun's new CHICKAPIGLETS game:
    1. It's FUN! Yes I know I already mentioned that but as a teacher I
       know that you can have a wonderful lesson planned but if its not
       fun & engaging for the students they really don't pay attention.
       Well this game holds their attention... especially when a COW POOP
       card gets turned over... oh my do they giggle!!!
       [IMG-7466.jpg]
    2. It's a COOPERATIVE game! Yep no winners, no losers! I know kids
       need to learn healthy competition skills however, for this age
       group, many are just not ready for that skill. The objective is to
       work together to help Little Joe Chickapig race the cow around the
       game board. Yep! they are building those social skills! They take
       turns but everyone is moving the same game token. However each
       player does get their own Animal Hybrid card  & they work to match
       the 2 animals to make new silly animals.
       [IMG-7464.jpg]
    3. It reinforces EARLY LEARNING SKILLS! This game is similar to the
       Memory game that we all remember playing. On your turn, you turn
       over 2 tokens to try to match them to the animals to the ones your
       Animal Hybrid card. (Warning: here comes a little "teacher talk"!)
       Research has proven that memory-type games and activities have many
       benefits: improves concentration, increases attention span,
       improves cognitive skills, reinforces visual tracking skills,
       improves ability to distinguish similarities and differences and
       the list goes on. All of these early skills are crucial to building
       a foundation for academic success. So YES!...this game is good for
       the brain!!!
    4. There's MORE THAN ONE WAY to play! If racing that cow around the
       gameboard is too slow for you, there are "Advanced Play"
       rules/directions included. After finishing our first game, the
       cuties that I played with yesterday actually started playing a
       basic memory game with the Animal Tokens. They were also trying to
       come up with some new Animal Hybrids for Little Joe Chickapig's
       farm...loved seeing those creative imaginations at work!
       [IMG-7465.jpg]

   Y'all I could go on and on but I think you get the idea... this game is
   AWESOME! A big thank you Brian Calhoun & the Chickapig gang for
   creating another fabulous game! Head on over to their Facebook page to
   read more about it. {Click HERE for Chickapig Facebook page}
   Now it's time for a Target run.... go grab one for yourself! I promise
   your kiddos will love it! And if you haven't already grabbed a copy of
   Brian Calhoun's book Little Joe Chickapig, be sure to throw that in
   your cart also! {Click HERE to read my post about the book!}

Little Joe Chickapig Cookie Treats

   Hey y'all it almost time for a little Easter break {woo hoo!!!} The
   past few weeks we have been learning all about egg-hatching animals.
   Last month I just so happened to come across a fabulous book Little Joe
   Chickapig by Brian Calhoun. This sweet story about following your
   dreams has captured the hearts of my students. They have fallen in love
   with this adorable little half chicken-half pig critter. Little Joe
   Chickapig has helped inspire us to write about our dreams, motivated us
   to learn more about characters and settings of books, helped us to make
   text-to-self connections and also helped us to engage in oodles of
   hands-on learning fun. To sum it up... Little Joe Chickapig has become
   part of our classroom! We just love him!!  So as a little Easter treat,
   I decided to make a special snack for my awesome hard-working kiddos...
   Oh yes! you guessed it... Little Joe Chickapig cookies! Omigoodness I
   wish you could have heard the squeals when they saw these sitting on
   the table. Happy, motivated kiddos sure do make this teacher's heart
   smile! I hope everyone has a fabulous weekend!

From Egg-sitting to Chick-sitting!

   Check out what Little Joe Chickapig was up to in our classroom...
   Yep! Thats's right LJC was doing a little egg-sitting for some of the
   hens back at the Chickapig farm & asked us for a little help. Of course
   we said yes & quickly discovered that egg-sitting is a lot of work. We
   had to check the eggs often to be sure that they were safe and warm. We
   also had to carefully turn them...just like the mama hen does. (Shhh,
   don’t tell them but they are also getting a little extra practice
   telling time!) We used our "EGG-SITTING LOG BOOK"  to keep track of all
   of this.
   [whcpic7.png]
   {This Log Book is part of my "What's Hatchin' Chick?" unit.}
   First, all of the students made a warm and safe nest to keep their egg
   in. Many also chose to cover it with a little blanket (since they were
   a little too big to sit on the egg to keep it warm! lol) Awww, they're
   so stinkin' cute!
   Check out some of these cute names... Little Bob, Rozee, Little Jo, Chi
   Chi...
   We stopped about every hour to do an "egg check" (I tried to stop on
   the hour since my students were just learning to tell time to the
   hour.) The wrote down the time, turned the egg and check to be sure it
   was warm and safe.
   [egg%2Blog1.png]
   At the end of the school day, my students decided that they wanted to
   put the eggs back under Chickapig. When I asked them if they wanted to
   take their eggs home with them they said, “No we want Chickapig to keep
   them warm so they hatch!”  Hmmm... ???
   Fast forward to the next morning... WOW! Little Joe Chickapig is one
   awesome [DEL: egg-sitter :DEL]  chick-sitter! We found 6 adorable
   little fluffy chicks & a note. Omiword! these kiddos were beyond
   excited! A few things that I heard that morn... "Chickapig you did it!"
   "Thank you for keeping the eggs warm all night!" "He followed his
   heart!" "I guess he took the rest of the eggs back to the farm."
   One of my favorite questions that morning came from a sweet little girl
   who raises chickens at home... "So Miss B, do you think these are baby
   chickapigs or just plain old chickens?" lol
   Baby chickapig or baby chicken...we really didn't care but after
   noticing that they had beaks instead of snouts, we figured out they
   were chicks and... We LOVE them! <3
   Be sure to check out my "What's Hatchin' Chick" unit for the
   Egg-Sitting Log Book that we used in this post plus oodles of other
   activities to go along with your hatching unit.
   [WhatsHatchinChickcoverpic.png]
   Thank you so much Little Joe Chickapig for hanging out in our classroom
   and inspiring all kinds of learning fun!
   {Pssst! ...if you haven't picked up this awesome book yet, head to
   Target now!}
   Also, be sure to check out the Chickapig Facebook page!

   it's time for me to head to the kitchen to come up with a fun little
   treat for my students...

LITTLE JOE CHICKAPIG Writing Craftivity {freebie!}

   Hey y'all I'm back with more LITTLE JOE CHICKAPIG talk! If you read my
   blog post last week then you know about this "treasure" that I stumbled
   upon at Target. If you missed that post, then just sit back, watch this
   quick little video introduction and then let me tell you a little bit
   about it...

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJdB-u6LHVE

   Last week I found the most amazing resource for teaching young children
   the importance of following your dreams... LITTLE JOE CHICKAPIG: A
   Story About Following Your Dreams! It was released earlier this month &
   is sold exclusively at Target right now.  It is so stinkin' cute!!
   ...and that plush CHICKAPIG toy...irrisistable!!! Omigoodness!
   [IMG-5673.JPG]
   Soooo...just what is a CHICKAPIG??? Hmmm...CHICK---A---PIG?? That's
   exactly what I was thinking when I spotted this thing perched up on
   that shelf in Target the other night. Then I opened up the book and...
   Ta Da!!!...my question was answered.

                 [chickapig%2Bdefinition%2Bvia%2Btarget.png]
                          (image via Target website)

   I LOVE LOVE  LOVE it! What a cute and unique little dude! ...the
   perfect character for this story. This adorable rhyming book is written
   by Brian Calhoun and illustrated by Pat Bradley and Brian Calhoun. In
   addition to being the author of this book, Brian Calhoun is also a
   well-respected custom guitar maker. He has apparently made guitar for
   famous stars, including Keith Urban, Jason Mraz & Dave Matthews just to
   name a few! WOW!!! He sure knows how to follow his dreams-from guitar
   maker to children's book author! Rock on Brian!!!
   LITTLE JOE CHICKAPIG  has a very clear message that ALL children need
   to hear: Follow your dreams, whatever they may be. (And, as adults, I
   think its important for us to be reminded of this from time to time
   also.) As C.S. Lewis said, You are never too old to set a new goal, or
   to dream a new dream. Some days I'm still trying to decided what I want
   to be when I grow up! lol ;) As a teacher, I believe that instilling
   courage & confidence in my students gives them the power to accomplish
   anything that they set their mind to in this big 'ole world.
   What message can kiddos get from this book?
   1. Follow your dreams.
   2. Have courage to try new things.
   3. Listen to advice from your parents, teachers & other grown ups in
   your life.
   4. Work hard.
   5. Never give up.
   I am so in love with this book & the message that it sends! I really
   wanted to find a way to extend my students' learning so I decided to
   create a few extension resources to compliment the story of  LITTLE JOE
   CHICKAPIG. I made several versions of  "Follow Your Dreams" writing
   prompt to match your students' writing levels. This writing craftivity
   can be easily differentiated for kinders, firsties or 2nd graders.

                         [chickapig%2Bcoverpic.png]
                Click on the book to check out this resource!

   I used the beginning writer version with my kinders.  Here is the
   finished work from one of my littles...
   [IMG-5675.jpg]
   Just in case you're wondering, this kinder wrote: I want to drive a big
   monster truck and go to the Monster Jam. This sweet little guy has come
   so far with his writing this year and all he ever talks about OR writes
   about OR draws about is monster trucks! I was definitely not surprised
   to see this was his dream! So darn cute!!
   This book is truly one of my favs! I highly recommend that y'all get
   out and make that Target run & grab yourself a copy!  And don't forget
   to always FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!
   [1zebra%2Bsignature.jpg]
   P.S. Be sure to look for the little cow on each page of the book!

Introducing... Little Joe Chickapig!

   Oh my goodness y'all! Look what I found at Target tonight!!! Ahhhhh! I
   just can't take all the cuteness!
   My kiddos wanted to go browse in the book section when we made a quick
   run to Target. And by quick I mean that I squeezed in time to grab a
   quick drink at Starbucks AND wander aimlessly through the Dollar Spot
   shelves AND all those cute spring purses.... well... you get the
   picture-it was a typical Target trip...just shopping for all the things
   we don't need. LOL Anyway back to this stinkin' adorable book... That
   CHICKAPIG stuffed animal caught my eye instantly! Ohhhhh it's just so
   cute but "What the heck is a Chickapig?" is what I was wondering. So I
   grabbed the book and mystery solved!
   This is a story about following your dreams. The pictures are
   absolutely adorable & I know my kinders are going to love the rhyming
   text. I highly recommend this little treasure that I stumbled upon
   tonight! {*This is not a paid endorsement-I just really love this
   book!}
   Be sure to check back soon-I've started creating a few reproducibles
   and writing prompts to go along with Little Joe Chickapig!
   Hope you [DEL: enjoy :DEL] survive the rest of this full moon week! :)
