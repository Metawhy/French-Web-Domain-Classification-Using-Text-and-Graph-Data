Abstract

Aim

   To assess the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing
   biodiversity decline. We first test whether species richness of
   butterfly assemblages is higher within European Natura 2000 (N2000)
   sites than in their surroundings. We then assess temporal trends in
   butterfly richness and test whether these trends differ inside and
   outside the N2000 network.

Location

   Germany, Europe.

Methods

   We utilized generalized linear mixed‐effects models (GLMM) to analyse
   an 11‐year data series on species richness of butterfly assemblages
   collected on 245 transects across Germany, located inside and outside
   N2000 sites, and comprising a total of 122 butterfly species.

Results

   Butterfly species richness was highest inside N2000 protected areas,
   while outside it constantly declined with increasing distance from
   N2000 sites. We found an overall decline in species richness by 10%
   within 11 years. This decline neither differed between transects
   located inside or outside the N2000 network nor varied with distance
   from N2000 sites.

Main conclusions

   The higher species richness inside the N2000 network underlines their
   proper designation and their potential for the conservation of
   biodiversity. However, the current negative trend in butterfly species
   richness across Germany is not mitigated by the N2000 network, and we
   assume insufficient management or measures targeted at other organisms
   than butterflies as potential reasons.

1 INTRODUCTION

   In spite of nationally and internationally set goals and introduced
   policies, we are currently experiencing an undiminished decline of
   biodiversity (Brooks et al., 2012; Butchart et al., 2010; Eskildsen
   et al., 2015; Tittensor et al., 2014). In Europe, the cornerstone of
   species protection policy is the Natura 2000 (N2000) network of
   protected areas (EC, 2010). The N2000 network is one of the most
   important and largest conservation networks of the world (Hochkirch
   et al., 2013; Lockwood, 2006), currently covering over 18% of the EU′s
   land surface (EC, 2015a). It has been based on two basic directives—the
   “Birds Directive” targeted on the conservation of birds (EEC, 1979) and
   the “Habitats Directive” focussing on selected threatened species and
   habitats (EEC, 1992).

   Several studies already investigated the effectiveness of designation,
   that is, how well the N2000 network covers the distribution of
   threatened species or the diversity of certain taxonomic groups (e.g.,
   D'Amen et al., 2013; Guareschi, Bilton, Velasco, Millán, & Abellán,
   2015; Maiorano et al., 2015; Trochet & Schmeller, 2013; Van der Sluis
   et al., 2016; Verovnik, Govedič, & Šalamun, 2011). These studies
   conclude that, with a few exceptions, the coverage of biodiversity is
   largely satisfactory.

   In addition to the successful designation of areas of high
   biodiversity, an even more critical measure of success would be the
   ability of protected areas to diminish, halt or even reverse the
   currently observed negative trends in biodiversity. Published trends of
   target and non‐target species (usually mammals and birds) in protected
   areas across the world tend to be rather positive (Barnes et al., 2016;
   Geldmann et al., 2013; Laurance et al., 2012), but have rarely been
   compared with populations outside protected areas.

   Studies assessing trends in species richness or abundance to evaluate
   the efficiency of the European N2000 network over time are scarce, and
   all of them focus on birds. These studies found predominantly positive
   trends of species protected under the Birds Directive, in particular
   flagship and specialized species, which seems to indicate an overall
   success of EU legislation (Donald et al., 2007; Sanderson et al.,
   2016), while for common and non‐target species, the pattern appears to
   be ambiguous (Devictor, Godet, Julliard, Couvet, & Jiguet, 2007;
   Pellissier, Touroult, Julliard, Siblet, & Jiguet, 2013; Santana et al.,
   2014). Given the low number of studies and their limitation to a few
   taxonomic groups, a general assessment of the extent to which the N2000
   network can reduce negative trends is currently hardly possible.

   Here, we assess the effectiveness of N2000 sites in preventing the
   decline of biodiversity using butterflies as an example for a
   non‐target species group. Butterflies are a popular group of insects
   which is appreciated by the public for their aesthetic, symbolic and
   intrinsic value (Potts et al., 2016). Moreover, as primary consumers,
   pollinators and prey they fulfil important roles in ecosystem
   functioning and are often used as indicators for the assessment of the
   state of ecosystems (Erhardt & Thomas, 1991; Van Swaay, Warren, & Loïs,
   2006; Zografou, Sfenthourakis, Pullin, & Kati, 2009). They are
   frequently an object of research and probably the most surveyed group
   of insects, at least in Europe (Van Swaay, Nowicki, Settele, & Van
   Strien, 2008; Van Swaay et al., 2006). These qualities predestine
   butterflies to be a convenient surrogate for less conspicuous taxa
   (Thomas et al., 2004). Butterflies can act as flagship and umbrella
   species and thus contribute to the conservation of habitats and other
   organisms (Maes & Van Dyck, 2005; Simberloff, 1998; Spitzer, Beneš,
   Dandová, Jašková, & Konvička, 2009). In our study, we used time series
   data on species richness of butterflies across Germany to address two
   particular aims: (a) To test whether butterfly species richness is
   higher in N2000 areas compared to their surroundings and (b) to assess
   overall temporal trends in species richness of butterfly assemblages
   and whether these trends differ inside and outside the N2000 network.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study sites and butterfly data

   We used data from the German Butterfly Monitoring Scheme
   (www.tagfalter-monitoring.de). Here, monitoring has been conducted by
   volunteers since 2005 according to a standardized protocol (see Kühn
   et al., 2008 for details). Data quality is checked by experts, and the
   data are centrally managed. The number of transects has been growing
   over time; therefore, there are 11‐year data series for the oldest
   transects and shorter series for the others, covering 5–11 years.
   Transect data at different time spans (i.e., number of years of
   observation) were evenly distributed, resulting in about 40 transect
   data per time span. Transects also differed in length, but each
   transect consists of several sections with a standard length of 50 m.
   For our analysis, we selected transects with 5–20 sections, resulting
   in 245 transects distributed all across Germany (Supporting Information
   Figure S1). We excluded data points with less than two species per year
   and transect leading to 1993 transect‐year combinations for our
   analysis.

   We used a map of N2000 sites obtained from the European Environmental
   Agency (EEA, 2011) to identify the position of the transects with the
   GIS software SAGA 2.1.4 in two ways. Transects overlaying at least
   partly with N2000 sites were considered as “inside.” About 28% of the
   considered transects were inside N2000 areas, which is larger than the
   overall coverage of N2000 areas in Germany (15.5%; EC, 2015a). We also
   measured the distance of individual transects (centre points) from the
   boundary of the closest N2000 site using the function near, implemented
   in the software ArcGis 10.2.

   We included occurrence data of 122 species of true butterflies
   (families Nymphalidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, Riodinidae, Papilionidae)
   and skippers (family Hesperiidae). Hardly distinguishable species were
   treated as complexes resulting in a final list of 115 items (Supporting
   Information Table S1).

   To account for potential differences in habitat suitability among
   transects within and outside N2000 areas, we computed a “habitat
   suitability index” (hsi) for each transect, which basically weights the
   amount of a particular habitat type by the number of species that are
   associated with this habitat type. In particular, we used habitat data
   from the Map of European ecosystem types (European Environment Agency,
   http://biodiversity.europa.eu/maes) classified according to EUNIS
   habitat classification level 2 (EEA, 2014) and calculated the
   percentage of each habitat type within a 1 km radius around each
   transect centre point. To assess habitat associations, we extracted the
   number of butterfly species associated with each habitat type from
   Reinhardt, Sbieschne, Settele, Fischer, and Fiedler (2007). Finally,
   the percentage of a habitat type occurring within the buffer zone of a
   particular transect was multiplied by the number of its associated
   butterfly species and the hsi was calculated as the sum of all habitat
   specific values in the buffer zone.

2.2 Data analysis

   All statistical analyses were performed using the software r 3.3.2 (R
   Core Team, 2016). We computed species richness (as number of species)
   for each sampling year within each transect. To test for the effect of
   N2000 sites on species richness of butterfly assemblages, their overall
   temporal trends and hypothesized differences in trends between N2000
   sites and their surroundings, we constructed generalized linear
   mixed‐effects models (GLMM) with a Poisson distribution and log link
   function, using the R package lme4 version 1.1‐12 (Bates, Maechler,
   Bolker, & Walker, 2014). We used the location of transects (inside or
   outside) or, alternatively, the distance of transects from the nearest
   N2000 area to test for differences in species richness within and
   outside N2000 areas. We included year (scaled to mean zero and unit
   standard deviation) as a further explanatory variable to assess overall
   temporal trends in species richness and the interaction of year and
   location (inside or outside) or distance to test for differences in
   trends. The relevance of this interaction was assessed according to
   resulting p‐values. We also included transect length as a covariable to
   account for potential sampling effects. To account for potential
   problems of pseudoreplication, we included transect as a random effect
   allowing for random intercepts and random slopes of year. To control
   for potentially confounding effects of general differences in overall
   habitat suitability inside and outside N2000 areas, we alternatively
   computed models including hsi (scaled to mean zero and unit standard
   deviation) as an additional variable which lead to four models in total
   (Supporting Information Table S2). All models were checked for spatial
   autocorrelation in the residuals by computing overall Moran's I using
   the R package ncf version 1.1‐7 (Bjornstad, 2013), but no spatial
   autocorrelation was found. We used the R package effects version 4.0‐0
   (Fox, 2003) for visualizing the results.

3 RESULTS

   According to our expectations, butterfly species richness was higher
   within N2000 sites than outside (Figure 1a; Supporting Information
   Table S2) and it constantly decreased with growing distance from the
   N2000 sites (Figure 1b, Supporting Information Table S2). Models using
   location (inside or outside N2000) or distance were both statistically
   significant, but according to AIC values, the distance from N2000
   appeared to be a better predictor of butterfly diversity than the
   location (delta AIC > 2; Supporting Information Table S2). The effect
   of distance may be attributed to habitat availability in the
   surroundings of N2000 sites. However, the effect of hsi on species
   richness was not statistically significant (p = 0.11 and 0.13,
   respectively), while the effect of location and distance remained
   significant (models M3 and M4 in Supporting Information Table S2). The
   hsi in buffer zones around transects did not differ significantly
   within or outside N2000 areas (Welch two‐sample t test: t = 1.88,
   df = 100.1, p = 0.063) but decreased with growing distance from N2000
   sites (linear regression: coefficient = −0.57, SE = 0.29, t = 1.97,
   p = 0.050).

   We also found that butterfly species richness declined over the
   11 years of observation (Figure 2, Supporting Information Table S2).
   The overall mean decline was 10%—from an average of 19.5 to 17.5
   species per transect. However, we did not find an interaction effect
   between N2000 sites and year (neither for location nor for distance) in
   any of the four models (M1: p = 0.35, M2: p = 0.93, M3: p = 0.47, M4:
   p = 0.91), indicating that the negative trends in species richness did
   not differ between N2000 sites and their surroundings (Figure 3).

4 DISCUSSION

   We found that N2000 areas harboured more butterfly species than their
   surroundings as expected. This result suggests a proper designation of
   the N2000 network and that these sites are of overall high conservation
   importance. Several previous studies at the European scale on mammals
   and birds also showed that the majority of species (both target and
   non‐target) seems to be well covered by the current extent of the N2000
   network (Maiorano et al., 2015; Trochet & Schmeller, 2013; Van der
   Sluis et al., 2016), but see Albuquerque, Assunção‐Albuquerque,
   Cayuelac, Zamoraa, and Benitoa (2013). For insects and other
   invertebrates, only regional assessments have been performed and their
   results are equivocal (D'Amen et al., 2013; Guareschi et al., 2015;
   Hernandez‐Manrique, Numa, Verdu, Galante, & Lobo, 2012). The only
   detailed study on butterflies showed that hotspots of species richness
   in Slovenia are well covered by the N2000 network (Verovnik et al.,
   2011).

   We also found that the distance from N2000 sites is a better predictor
   of butterfly richness than a simpler inside–outside approach. We
   propose two not mutually exclusive explanations for this phenomenon.
   The first is related to a gradual decrease in the availability of
   suitable butterfly habitats with increasing distance from N2000 sites.
   N2000 sites often represent the most diverse or particularly important
   parts within an overall valuable landscape (e.g., Verovnik et al.,
   2011). In such landscapes, butterfly species are likely to thrive
   accordingly well also outside the protected areas. Indeed, the amount
   of suitable habitat tended to decrease with growing distance from
   protected areas, indicating that such gradual changes in landscape
   structure can at least partly explain the distance effect. However,
   even when the amount of suitable habitat was considered in the models,
   a pure distance effect remained. One reason might be that not only
   habitat availability decreased with distance from N2000 sites but also
   the quality, for example, in terms of resource availability or
   management intensity (Kleijn & Van Langevelde, 2006).

   A second likely explanation of the observed distance effect relates to
   source‐sink dynamics (Furrer & Pasinelli, 2016; Pulliam, 1988) in a
   metapopulation context (Hanski, 1998). According to this concept,
   species may persist under less favourable conditions outside the N2000
   areas, because they may constantly immigrate from N2000 sites where the
   environmental conditions allow high population growth rates (Furrer &
   Pasinelli, 2016; Hanski, 1998). The observed distance effect is then
   defined by the dispersal ability (Furrer & Pasinelli, 2016) of the
   species within a particular assemblage. Given such a potential source
   effect of N2000 sites, our results not only confirm the importance of
   N2000 sites for protecting biodiversity within the network but also
   highlight their beneficial effects in their surroundings. However, this
   cannot be an excuse for bad management outside the N2000 network, since
   in the same way as protected areas are positively influencing their
   surroundings, detrimental forces in the surroundings can also
   negatively influence protected areas (Laurance et al., 2012).

   Most worryingly, we found an overall decline in butterfly species
   richness at German monitoring sites of 10% between 2005 and 2015.
   Although our study covered only Germany, our results suggest that
   similar processes of local species extinctions may occur in other
   European regions. Indeed, Maes and Van Dyck (2001) showed a strong
   decrease in the number of butterfly species in northern Belgium during
   the 20th century. A similar pattern was found in Denmark, where the
   most severe declines occurred between 1960 and 1979 and moderate
   declines continued in subsequent periods such as between 2000 and 2012
   (Eskildsen et al., 2015). Local species extinctions are often preceded
   by a decline in population abundance or density, which corresponds well
   to the decreasing abundances in butterfly populations as it has been
   shown, for example, by the European grassland butterfly indicator (Van
   Swaay et al., 2008, 2015). Another recent study showed a more than 75%
   decline in flying insect biomass in German protected areas (Hallmann
   et al., 2017). Potential causes of such declines are habitat loss
   (Sang, Teder, Helm, & Pärtel, 2010), fragmentation (Hanski, 2015;
   Krauss et al., 2010), habitat degradation (Stefanescu, Peñuelas, &
   Filella, 2009) or climate change (Oliver et al., 2015; Schweiger,
   Settele, Kudrna, Klotz, & Kühn, 2008; Settele, Bishop, & Potts, 2016;
   Settele et al., 2008).

   Despite generally higher butterfly species richness within N2000
   protected areas, their designation has obviously not prevented a loss
   of species over time. This result leads to the question whether current
   management of N2000 areas is generally suited to prevent such losses.
   Many butterfly species in Europe depend on habitats that require active
   management (grazing, mowing, coppicing etc.; see Van Swaay et al.,
   2012) to preserve them in a favourable state. This is especially true
   for European grasslands (Rundlöf, Bengtsson, & Smith, 2008; Van Swaay
   et al., 2012, 2015), the major habitat type of European butterflies.
   According to the last assessment of the state of nature in the European
   Union, grasslands are generally in an unfavourable conservation status
   across Europe (EC, 2015b). This situation holds true also for Germany,
   although there was a slight improvement since the previous assessment
   (EC, 2014). In Germany, comprehensive management plans have been
   adopted for only 20% of the entire network area (EC, 2014). Such a lack
   of management can lead to degradation and overgrowing, particularly of
   grasslands, by highly competitive vegetation of later successional
   stages (Collins & Beaufoy, 2012; Lindenmayer et al., 2007; Spitzer
   et al., 2009) and thus potentially contribute to the observed declines
   in butterfly richness. However, even if management plans are
   implemented, they might be inadequate for butterflies, for example,
   when agricultural intensity is too high (Konvička et al., 2008) or when
   management is targeted towards other organisms (Lindenmayer et al.,
   2007), or the time span since implementation was too short for being
   effective (Woodcock et al., 2012).

   We conclude that there is a notable decline in species richness of
   butterflies across Germany but the N2000 protected areas do currently
   not qualify as an effective mitigation measure. We argue that one of
   the main causes is the absence or insufficient implementation of
   management. We believe that negative biodiversity trends could be
   mitigated by fully implementing the European Habitats Directive which
   has not been done so far (Maes et al., 2013). This includes
   improvements in management, the allocation of funds towards targeted
   biodiversity support and enhanced monitoring (Collins & Beaufoy, 2012;
   Hochkirch et al., 2013; Hodge, Hauck, & Bonn, 2015; Potts et al.,
   2016). Furthermore, future management concepts need to consider a wider
   biodiversity context and should also take into account the mitigation
   of other potential drivers such as climate change. With respect to
   butterflies (and many other organisms as well), this means, for
   example, a stronger consideration of the landscape context in
   conservation planning and management for heterogeneity of habitats
   across space and time (Dennis, 2010; Papanikolaou, Kühn, Frenzel, &
   Schweiger, 2017; Van Swaay et al., 2012).

Summary

   Background music has been claimed to enhance people's creativity. In
   three experiments, we investigated the impact of background music on
   performance of Compound Remote Associate Tasks (CRATs), which are
   widely thought to tap creativity. Background music with foreign
   (unfamiliar) lyrics (Experiment 1), instrumental music without lyrics
   (Experiment 2), and music with familiar lyrics (Experiment 3) all
   significantly impaired CRAT performance in comparison with quiet
   background conditions. Furthermore, Experiment 3 demonstrated that
   background music impaired CRAT performance regardless of whether the
   music induced a positive mood or whether participants typically studied
   in the presence of music. The findings challenge the view that
   background music enhances creativity and are discussed in terms of an
   auditory distraction account (interference‐by‐process) and the
   processing disfluency account.

   Creativity is a vital aspect of cognition underpinning activities such
   as innovative product design, scientific advancement, and effective
   advertising and marketing communications. Background music is an
   environmental stimulus known to influence cognitive performance, which
   has also been claimed to enhance people's creativity for tasks
   involving spatial abilities such as drawing (see Schellenberg, Nakata,
   Hunter, & Tamoto, 2007). We argue, however, that there is limited
   empirical support for the claimed benefits of background music on
   creativity, with to our knowledge only one other study (i.e., Ritter &
   Ferguson, 2017) demonstrating a facilitatory effect on creativity of
   background music that participants were free to attend to for a task
   that involved participants listing novel, alternative uses for a common
   object (i.e., a brick). Another reason to be cautious regarding the
   notion that background music can enhance performance on tasks tapping
   creative cognition is the presence of a substantial research base
   demonstrating that to‐be‐ignored background sound impairs task
   performance (Beaman, 2005; Hughes & Jones, 2003).

   In the present paper, we critically examine the claim that background
   music enhances creativity by employing variants of widely used verbal
   problem solving tasks that are typically used to study creativity
   (Ansburg, 2000; Fodor, 1999; Mednick & Mednick, 1967; Mehta, Zhu, &
   Cheema, 2012; Mikulincer & Sheffi, 2000; Storm, Angello, & Bjork, 2011)
   being indexed by, and solved via, a process of insight: Compound Remote
   Associate Tasks (CRATs; e.g., see Bowden, Jung‐Beeman, Fleck, &
   Kounios, 2005; see below for further explanation). We contrast two
   competing accounts of the impact of background music on creative
   problem solving: (a) the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al.,
   2012), in which background music potentially enhances creativity by
   engendering processing disfluency and thence increased task engagement;
   and (b) the auditory distraction (interference‐by‐process) account
   (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000; Marsh, Hughes, & Jones, 2009; Perham &
   Vizard, 2010), which assumes that the presence of any type of auditory
   distractor sequence will disrupt cognitive task performance providing
   it demonstrates changing‐state characteristics. That is, auditory
   sequences in which a series of elements differ from one element to the
   next (such as tones, syllables, and words) in terms of
   frequency/pitch/timbre are more disruptive than a series within which
   the same element is repeated such as the same tone, syllable, or word.
   It has been shown, for example, that the latter, steady‐state stimuli
   typically fail to disrupt short‐term memory performance (e.g., Jones &
   Macken, 1993). It is worth noting here that in addition to this
   “acoustic interference‐by‐process,” an interference‐by‐process can also
   operate at a semantic level due to a clash between two concurrent
   semantic processes: a deliberate one applied to the to‐be‐remembered
   material and one applied automatically to the to‐be‐ignored auditory
   material (Marsh et al., 2009; Marsh, Hughes, & Jones, 2008). The focus
   of the current paper, however, is on the acoustic
   interference‐by‐process (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000).

   Prior to considering the relationship between background music and
   creative problem solving performance, it is useful to note that
   researchers have traditionally made a key distinction between two types
   of creative thinking, that is, divergent thinking versus convergent
   thinking (Guilford, 1967). Divergent thinking refers to a strategy
   whereby multiple creative ideas are produced and appraised within a
   short period of time in order to generate potential solutions for a
   given problem. A typical task involving divergent thinking is the
   Alternative Uses Task, wherein participants are required to think of as
   many uses as possible for a simple, everyday object such as a brick or
   paperclip (cf. the aforementioned study of music and creativity by
   Ritter & Ferguson, 2017). Convergent thinking, on the other hand,
   permits the connection of different ideas to determine a single,
   correct solution to a problem. Importantly, tasks involving creative
   convergent thinking—including the CRATs that we employed in the present
   study, as discussed below—may do so on the basis of associations and
   potential solutions generated through divergent thought.

   It is additionally important to note that creative problem solving,
   whether underpinned by divergent or convergent thinking, is often
   characterised by the ability to perceive a problem space in new ways by
   discovering hidden patterns or by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas
   (e.g., Ohlsson, 2011). One key way in which creative problem solving
   comes about is by means of so‐called insight, with tasks involving
   creative thinking typically being solved via insight processes.
   Accounts of insight in problem solving such as the “special‐process
   theory” (e.g., Ball & Stevens, 2009; Bowden et al., 2005) argue that
   problems that tend to be solved via an insight process call upon very
   different processing mechanisms to “noninsight” problems. For example,
   Jung‐Beeman et al. (2004) identified neural patterns just prior to the
   emergence of insight that demonstrate a hemispheric shift in processing
   occurring at this point. Jung‐Beeman et al. (2004) propose that during
   insight problem solving loose associative processing occurring
   nonconsciously in the right temporal lobe takes precedence over
   finer‐grained processing in the left hemisphere, implying that neural
   areas linked with diffuse associative processing are critical for the
   emergence of creative insight (for a recent review of related findings,
   see Shen, Yuan, Liu, & Luo, 2017).

   Several researchers suppose that an insight sequence defines creative
   thinking and that any advance in thought that is not characterised by
   such a sequence is therefore not creative (e.g., Ohlsson, 2011;
   Perkins, 2000; Wiley & Jarosz, 2012; but see Weisberg, 2015). This
   unique sequence of events that defines insight in problem solving
   comprises: presentation of the problem, repeated failure, impasse,
   restructuring, and an “Aha!” experience that is associated with
   solution generation. According to this sequence of events, failed
   attempts to solve a problem can lead to an impasse, whereby the
   participant, after several unsuccessful attempts at solving the
   problem, feels they are unable to move forward to reach a solution.
   After a period of failing to make progress, an abandoning of the
   original problem structure occurs and a new representation of the
   problem is formed through restructuring, which may itself be based on
   processes such as spreading activation in associative networks (see
   Shen et al., 2017). Such problem restructuring may then lead to the
   emergence of a solution. Crucially, problems that are typically solved
   by insight often cannot readily be solved via routine search processes.
   This is because the starting conditions, goals, and possible sequences
   of actions are ambiguous (i.e., a heuristic‐type search within the
   original problem representation will not yield a solution).

   As we have noted, our present research used CRATs as a measure of
   insight‐based creative problem solving (Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 1998). A
   CRAT involves a participant being shown three words (e.g., dress, dial,
   and flower), with the requirement being to find a single associated
   word (in this case “sun”) that can be combined with each presented word
   (either being placed before it or after it) to make a common word or
   phrase (i.e., sundress, sundial, and sunflower in the present example).
   CRATs are variants of problems referred to as Remote Associate Tasks
   (RATs; see Mednick, 1962; Mednick & Mednick, 1967), for which the
   solution can be associated with each of the provided three words in
   different ways. For example, a RAT (e.g., same, tennis, and head), in
   contrast to a CRAT, can be solved by means of semantic association
   (tennis match), synonymy (same = match) and, as with CRATs, the
   formation of compound words (matchhead).

   Nowadays, both RATs and CRATs are commonly used tests of creativity
   within psychology and cognitive neuroscience. They have been employed,
   for example, to examine creativity in relation to sleep (e.g., Cai,
   Mednick, Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009), memory (e.g., Storm et
   al., 2011), attention (e.g., Ansburg & Hill, 2003), and attentional
   deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g., White & Shah, 2011), and they
   have additionally been employed in neuroimaging studies of creativity
   (e.g., Arden, Chavez, Grazioplene, & Jung, 2010). According to Bowden
   and Jung‐Beeman (2003), the popularity of these problems resides in the
   fact that they have an unambiguous, single‐word answer, and that
   multiple items can be solved in a single session. Furthermore, RATs and
   CRATs are less complex than classic insight problems such as the candle
   problem or two‐string problem (see Weisberg, 1995), such that they are
   less susceptible to confounding of variables. These characteristics
   made these problems very appealing for the current investigation.

   Problem solving performance on RATs and CRATs has been found to
   correlate with performance on other creative tasks such as rebus
   puzzles (MacGregor & Cunningham, 2008; see Threadgold, Marsh, & Ball,
   2018, for further discussion) and classic insight tasks (Schooler &
   Melcher, 1995; but see Webb, Little, Cropper, & Ruze, 2017). Such
   patterns of association suggest that RATs and CRATs represent effective
   tests of creativity. Moreover, these problems also appear to involve
   “the same component processes critical for, and the same
   phenomenological experience of, insight solutions to more complex
   problems” (Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 2003, p. 634; see also Bowden &
   Jung‐Beeman, 2007). For example, the problems initially misdirect or
   fail to direct retrieval processes, thereby leading to an impasse. In
   addition, solvers often report an “Aha!” experience on task completion.
   As well as being characterised by the insight sequence, RATs and CRATs
   also appear to be underpinned by a range of other processes, including
   unconscious spreading activation in associative networks (Smith, Huber,
   & Vul, 2013), conscious verbal processes such as subvocal rehearsal
   (Ball & Stevens, 2009), and executive processes such as those that
   inhibit incorrect solution ideas and enable the active manipulation of
   information in working memory (Chein & Weisberg, 2014; Storm & Angello,
   2010).

   Although there is a paucity of research examining the effects of
   background music on creativity, there is a small literature on the
   impact of noise on creative cognition, with this research having
   typically used RATs, but occasionally other creative tasks too
   (Hillier, Alexander, & Beversdorf, 2006; Kasof, 1997; Martindale &
   Greenough, 1973; Mehta et al., 2012). For example, aperiodic noise such
   as white noise and pink noise has been shown to affect creativity, as
   measured using RATs. For example, Martindale and Greenough (1973;
   75 dB) and Hillier et al. (2006; 90 dB) showed that a high intensity
   white noise, compared with a no noise control condition, impaired task
   performance. Moreover, Kasof (1997) reported that a high level
   (85 dB[A]) of intermittent, compared with continuous, pink noise
   reduced creativity as measured with a poetry writing task. In contrast,
   Toplyn and Maguire (1991) found that highly creative participants (as
   gauged by their performance on RATs) demonstrated greater creativity on
   other tasks when exposed to 80 dB white noise, compared with when
   exposed to 60 or 100 dB white noise.

   Mehta et al. (2012) used more naturalistic, ambient noises to resemble
   restaurant noise, wherein distant construction noise, multitalker
   babble, and roadside traffic were blended and reported that a moderate
   level of noise (70 dB), as compared with low level noise (50 dB),
   improved performance on creative tasks. These tasks included RATs
   (Experiment 1), a task wherein participants generated novel ideas for
   improving mattress comfort (Experiment 2), a task requiring the
   generation of alternative uses for a brick (Experiment 3), and a task
   concerning how to clean scuffed shoes with no polish (Experiment 4). Of
   relevance to the present study, participants generated more correct
   answers to RATs in the presence of moderate noise compared with a low
   level of noise and a high level of noise (85 dB).

   We note here, however, that in contrast with the RATs, the other tasks
   used by Mehta et al. (2012) arguably make less demands on verbal
   working memory. Indeed, these tasks tap divergent thinking in that they
   require the production of multiple responses in a manner similar to
   standard verbal fluency tasks. Verbal fluency tasks require the
   production of numerous responses given a phonemic (produce words
   beginning with the letter “F”) or semantic (produce as many examples of
   “Fruit”) cue within a time limit (Jones, Marsh, & Hughes, 2012; Marsh,
   Crawford, Pilgrim, Sörqvist, & Hughes, 2017). Although some aspects of
   the task, such as the requirement to maintain memory for previously
   produced responses to avoid repetition tap verbal working memory, these
   tasks are not characterised by continuous generation and testing of
   word combinations and maintenance of intermediate solutions that
   distinguish the convergent thinking underpinning the RAT. Indeed,
   perhaps it is no surprise that tasks that tap divergent thinking such
   as category fluency tend to be immune to disruption produced by
   changing‐state background sound, unless it conveys semantic content
   (Jones et al., 2012). In this respect, our focus was on the variant of
   the RAT (i.e., the CRAT), since in contrast to divergent thinking
   tasks, CRATs should be more sensitive to disruption produced by the
   changing‐state acoustic properties of background sound.

   An alternative account of the relationship between background sound and
   creativity holds that benefits to cognitive task performance can be
   observed through mood and arousal (for a review, see Schellenberg,
   2005). For example, Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain (2001) showed
   that performance on tests of spatial abilities was improved when the
   tasks were executed after listening to music rated as “liked” by
   participants, as opposed to being exposed to quiet. Moreover, the
   improvement in performance was driven by changes in arousal and mood
   produced by listening to the music. It is important to note that mood
   and arousal are not the same construct. For example, mood can be
   decreased and arousal can be increased when music is disliked. It is
   possible that the effects of music on cognitive task performance are
   driven by changes to both mood and arousal, with increases in both
   leading to enhanced performance.

   A recent study by Ritter and Ferguson (2017) required participants to
   undertake tasks involving creative cognition while concurrently
   listening to music or exposure to quiet. In a between‐participants
   design, Ritter and Ferguson showed that a beneficial effect of music on
   creative task performance was limited to a comparison between a silent
   condition and a so‐called “happy music” condition (Vivaldi's “Four
   Seasons”). Exposure to “calm music,” “sad music,” and “anxious music”
   had no impact on creative task performance compared with quiet (but see
   Perham & Withey, 2012, for evidence of enhanced spatial rotation
   performance following listening to slow‐tempo, sad music of a
   participant's own choosing compared with a slow‐tempo control excerpt).
   In line with the notion that changes to mood and arousal may
   collectively enhance creative task performance, participants in Ritter
   and Ferguson's (2017) study assigned more positive mood and higher
   arousal to the happy music condition in comparison with the other
   conditions. Therefore, the benefit to creative task performance could
   have been driven by increases in mood and arousal rather than the
   presence of the music per se.

   Although the notion that increases in both mood and arousal can benefit
   creativity has some appeal, we note that Ritter and Ferguson (2017) did
   not report statistical comparisons between all of the music conditions
   in their between‐participants design, which potentially undermines
   their conclusions. Furthermore, Mehta et al. (2012) propose that
   arousal‐based explanations of the impact of to‐be‐ignored noise on
   creativity are insufficient because over a longer period of exposure to
   the sound, physiological arousal levels should normalise and cease to
   have a consistent influence. Thus, Mehta et al. argue that arousal is
   not the key contributing factor to the impact of to‐be‐ignored noise on
   creativity. They instead propose that moderate noise levels increase
   processing disfluency, with this processing disfluency increasing
   construal levels, thereby promoting more abstract thinking. More
   specifically, when construal levels are high, then individuals will
   engage in abstract thought to consider the “bigger picture” rather than
   focus on specific details (e.g., see Burgoon, Henderson, & Markman,
   2013). Such high‐level construal involves a focus on the commonality
   and central features of a situation such that its overall gist can be
   extracted. In contrast, the overall gist of a situation is less likely
   to be extracted when construal levels are low because people focus on
   peripheral (or secondary) features. In support of the influence of
   high‐level construal on creativity, research has demonstrated that
   performance on a wide range of creativity tasks can benefit from the
   experimental induction of abstract levels of thought (Friedman &
   Fӧrster, 2002; Fӧrster, Friedman, & Liberman, 2004).

   The processing disfluency account has its conceptual basis within
   research on metacognition, which focuses on processes that monitor and
   control cognition (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017a,b). Such metacognitive
   processes are involved in people's subjective judgements of how well a
   current task is being, could be, or has been performed. Metacognitive
   control processes about one's current task can be applied to initiate,
   terminate, or change the allocation of time, effort, and cognitive
   resources to the task (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017a). One of a variety of
   cues on which metacognitive monitoring is based is the subjective ease
   of processing (fluent vs. disfluent; easy vs. difficult) that derives
   from one's own experience at attempting the task. Subjective
   experiences of task difficulty can catalyse a shift in processing and
   engender increased task engagement (e.g., Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, &
   Eyre, 2007; Rummer, Schweppe, & Schwede, 2016).

   Attempts to comprehend metacognitive modulation of thought have
   typically evoked dual‐process theories, which posit the existence of
   two qualitatively distinct types of thinking: Types 1 and 2 processes
   (Evans & Stanovich, 2013a,b). Type 1 processes are autonomous and
   undemanding of working memory (a concept used in ways that links to
   notions of executive and attentional control) and tend to be fast,
   nonconscious, intuitive, and associative. On the other hand, Type 2
   processes rely on working memory (including executive and attentional
   control) and are focused on cognitive decoupling and mental simulation,
   critical for hypothetical thinking. Type 2 processes also tend to be
   slow, conscious, analytic, and deliberative. Type 2 processes can be
   activated if the monitoring system—as part of the metacognitive
   architecture—judges that a task is difficult (e.g., Bjork, Dunlosky, &
   Kornell, 2013; see also Thompson, 2010). Mehta et al. (2012) argue that
   the presence of noise creates processing disfluency and supports a
   processing shift inducing higher construal levels and more abstract
   thinking that is presumably linked to more diffuse associative
   processing of the type that is known to arise in creative insight. For
   example, in the case of CRATs, diffuse associative processing could
   cause spreading semantic activation within a network of associates
   yielding convergent activation on the word that the three seemingly
   unrelated words have in common, thereby yielding the solution (see
   Bowden & Beeman, 1998; Shen et al., 2017).

   That background sound can improve performance on creative tasks
   contrasts with a large literature relating to distraction of human
   cognition through exposure to noise (for reviews, see Beaman, 2005;
   Hughes & Jones, 2003). The task typically used to illustrate the
   vulnerability of cognition to disruption by the mere presence of
   to‐be‐ignored background sound is short‐term visual–verbal serial
   recall (Colle & Welsh, 1976; Jones & Macken, 1993; Salamé & Baddeley,
   1982). This task involves the visual presentation of verbal items
   (e.g., seven or eight letters or digits) with the requirement to recall
   these items according to the serial order in which they were presented.
   Initial work suggested that this disruption arose because the sound was
   composed of speech. However, the semantic properties of speech were
   found to be impotent in their capacity to disrupt serial recall: speech
   presented in a language understood by the participant produces no more
   disruption than that produced in a language incomprehensible to the
   participant (Jones, Miles, & Page, 1990). Thus, semantic properties of
   the to‐be‐ignored background sound were irrelevant to the level of
   disruption caused. Similarly, the notion that the disruption by
   background sound arose due to a confusion between phonemes derived from
   the visual items (via their covert articulation) that gain direct
   (spoken items) and indirect (visual items) access into a phonological
   store (Salamé & Baddeley, 1982) was undermined by findings that serial
   recall was shown to be susceptible to disruption by the presence of
   background music without lyrics, and therefore phonemes (Klatte,
   Kilcher, & Hellbrück, 1995; Klatte, Lachmann, Schlittmeier, &
   Hellbrück, 2010; Nittono, 1997; Salamé & Baddeley, 1989; Schlittmeier,
   Hellbrück, & Klatte, 2008), and by the presence of sequences of tones,
   provided they change from one successive tone to the next (Divin,
   Coyle, & James, 2001; Elliott, 2002; Jones & Macken, 1993).

   The key empirical referent for this so‐called “irrelevant sound effect”
   is the changing‐state effect. This concerns the finding that a changing
   sequence of sounds, regardless of whether the changes occur on a speech
   carrier (e.g., a sequence of different verbal tokens) or a nonspeech
   carrier (e.g., a sequence of tones of different frequency), disrupts
   serial recall to a far greater extent than a nonchanging or
   steady‐state sound (e.g., a repeated token or tone; Jones & Macken,
   1993; Jones, Madden, & Miles, 1992). According to the
   interference‐by‐process approach (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000), the
   pre‐attentive processing of the order of changes within sound impairs
   the deliberate serial rehearsal process that supports the ordered
   recall of to‐be‐remembered items.

   Given that the solving of CRATs appears to be underpinned by verbal
   processes such as subvocal rehearsal (Ball & Stevens, 2009) in addition
   to executive processes (Chein & Weisberg, 2014) and spreading
   activation in associative networks (Smith et al., 2013), we expect
   CRATs to be susceptible to disruption by the presence of to‐be‐ignored
   background music. Our rationale behind suggesting that verbal
   processing of CRATs will be susceptible to changing‐state distraction
   is supported by the findings that impairment of CRAT performance
   through concurrent articulatory suppression is observed within this
   procedure, whereas facilitation of CRAT performance occurs via
   encouraging verbalisation through the “think aloud” technique (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009). Thus, the availability of speech (inner speech or
   external speech) is necessary for efficient CRAT problem solving
   performance. In the context of serial recall, the skill of speech (or
   rather speech planning) is co‐opted because it provides an effective
   medium for retaining visual–verbal items due to its inherent
   sequentiality, continuity, and prosodic and co‐articulatory nature.
   Inner speech therefore enables the grafting of serial order constraints
   onto the presented list; the act of covertly co‐articulating
   to‐be‐remembered items generates sequential information and constraints
   that do not occur within the list itself. However, this motoric based
   serial rehearsal process is subject to interference from the automatic,
   pre‐attentive processing of the serial order of changes in a background
   auditory sequence (such as music).

   In our recent work, it is becoming clearer that tasks that may not
   necessarily involve serial rehearsal, but that do involve the use of
   inner speech for effective task performance (e.g., face recognition;
   Marsh et al., 2018) are also vulnerable to the changing‐state effect.
   Of course, speech (inner or outer) involves planning of sequential
   motor acts, which may render it vulnerable to disruption via
   changing‐state speech in many settings. In the context of CRATs, inner
   (and outer) speech clearly supports effective performance (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009). It may even be that participants use serial rehearsal
   to test out novel solutions.

   We do not claim that CRAT performance is underpinned entirely by verbal
   maintenance processes. Rather, it is clear that spreading semantic
   activation processes (Smith et al., 2013), and executive processes that
   are involved in generating response candidates and inhibiting
   misleading/incorrect solutions (Storm & Angello, 2010) are also central
   to the production of responses. That said, it is often not clear which
   component of a multicomponent task is associated with CRAT performance.
   For example, the finding of an association between Working Memory
   Capacity measures and CRAT performance (Chein & Weisberg, 2014) could
   be due to the role of attentional/cognitive control (which may involve
   executive control processes such as inhibition) or the requirement to
   retain serial order information: Working Memory Capacity tasks involve
   combining the short‐term storage of visual/verbal items with a
   concurrent processing task. Therefore, we hold that subvocal
   maintenance processes involving inner speech can underpin solution of
   CRATs and that this process is susceptible to disruption via processing
   of a changing‐state auditory sequence. The aim of the series of three
   experiments that we present here was to investigate the impact of
   to‐be‐ignored background sound (i.e., music with foreign, [unfamiliar]
   lyrics; instrumental music; and music with familiar lyrics) on tasks
   believed to measure creativity, that is, CRATs.

1 EXPERIMENT 1

   The aim of Experiment 1 was to establish if music with unfamiliar
   lyrics facilitates creativity as measured via performance with CRATs
   through engendering processing disfluency (Mehta et al., 2012), or
   impairs creativity, possibly due to the disruption of verbal processes
   such as subvocal rehearsal (Ball & Stevens, 2009) due to its
   changing‐state characteristics. To investigate these two competing
   accounts and opposing predictions, we contrasted performance in a quiet
   condition to a condition with to‐be‐ignored background music with
   clearly discernible lyrics in a foreign language that were unfamiliar
   to the participants (i.e., the musical excerpt contained Spanish lyrics
   presented to native English speakers; thus, the lyrics were both
   unfamiliar and meaningless to the participants, who were unable to
   process their semantic content). As such, any observed disruption could
   not be viewed as being attributable to interference between the
   semantic properties of the to‐be‐ignored sound and the semantic
   processes underpinning the solving of CRATs (see Marsh et al., 2008,
   2009). If unfamiliar music engenders processing disfluency (cf. Mehta
   et al., 2012), then one should observe better performance when music,
   as compared with quiet, accompanies problem solving. However, if verbal
   processes underpinning CRAT performance are susceptible to disruption
   via changing‐state irrelevant sound—as the interference‐by‐process
   account would assume (Jones & Tremblay, 2000)—then performance should
   be poorer in the presence of music as compared with quiet.

1.1 Method

1.1.1 Participants

   Thirty adults (15 female and 15 male) from the University of Central
   Lancashire participated in the experiment (M = 22 years, SD = 2.78, age
   range 19 to 30 years old). The participants were recruited via an
   opportunity sample. Participants received course credit or the standard
   department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of participation time.
   All participants spoke English as their first language and reported
   normal (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and hearing. The experiment
   received Ethical Clearance from the University of Central Lancashire.

1.1.2 Design and materials

   The design was a fully within‐participants 2 × 2 design with Sound
   (Quiet vs. Spanish Music) and CRAT Difficulty (Easy vs. Difficult) as
   the factors. A set of 38 CRATs were selected from the problems
   developed by Bowden and Jung‐Beeman (1998) using the program “Match”
   (Van Casteren & Davis, 2007). Match automates the selection of several
   groups of smaller stimuli sets from a larger pool ensuring the groups
   are matched on multiple dimensions. Here, the sets of CRATs were
   matched on solution accuracy and solution time data provided by Bowden
   and Jung‐Beeman (1998). Each CRAT consisted of the presentation of
   three single words, with the participant having to find a word that
   combines with each of the three presented words to make a common word
   or phrase. For example, if participants are presented with the words
   stick/maker/point, then the word that links with each of these is the
   word match to create the phrases or words matchstick, match maker, and
   match point. Therefore, the answer or target in this instance would be
   the word “match.”

   The 38 selected CRATs were divided into a set of 20 easy CRATs (Easy
   CRATs' solution rates: M = 68.9%, SD = 16.2, Easy CRATs' solution
   times: M = 8.23 s, SD = 2.61) and 18 difficult CRATs (Difficult CRATs'
   solution rates: M = 26.6%, SD = 14.3, Difficult CRATs' solution times:
   M = 12.1 s, SD = 3.07). Each difficulty set was then further divided
   into two equal matched sets (Set A solution rates: M = 49.4%,
   SD = 26.1, solution times: M = 9.98 s, SD = 3.6 vs. Set B solution
   rates: M = 48%, SD = 27, solution times: M = 10.1 s, SD = 3.3) as
   indexed by normative data on solution rate and solution time data for
   30‐s presentation time provided by Bowden and Jung‐Beeman (1998). It is
   typical to divide CRAT sets into easy and difficult (Ball & Stevens,
   2009). Difficult, but not easy, problems can benefit from overt
   verbalisation, whereas preventing subvocalisation via requiring
   participants to suppress articulation while problem solving can hinder
   performance with both easy and difficult problems (Ball & Stevens,
   2009). Although not a primary goal of the study, we nevertheless
   considered it important to investigate the potential differential
   susceptibility to distraction of easy and difficult problems. The
   experiment was fully counterbalanced such that each CRAT set appeared
   within each sound condition.

1.1.3 Procedure

   Participants read an information sheet and completed a consent form
   prior to taking part in the experiment. Participants were given
   instructions for the CRATs that explained the need to find one target
   word per problem, that, when combined with the three presented words
   (either before or after the presented words), created a common word or
   phrase. Prior to the test problems, participants were asked to tackle
   five practice problems to ensure familiarity with the task. These
   practice problems were also selected from Bowden and Jung‐Beeman
   (1998). Participants were allocated 30 s per CRAT item. All three
   problem words were presented simultaneously along the same horizontal
   plane.

   The music was played via Sennheiser HD‐202 headphones at approximately
   65–70 dB(A). The music was a 30‐s segment of a Spanish translation of a
   1990s UK chart pop song played via E‐Prime Software that contained
   clearly discernable lyrics and accompanying instruments. The music
   contains appreciable acoustic variation and satisfied the criterion for
   being a changing‐state stimulus. In the sound condition, this music
   segment accompanied each CRAT problem, starting with the onset of the
   problem and ending once the participant indicated they had solved the
   CRAT by pressing the spacebar. After participants pressed the spacebar,
   a textbox appeared wherein participants typed their answer.
   Participants were asked to complete the CRATs while ignoring the
   background sound. They were also reassured that they would not be asked
   anything about the background sound. Participants were fully debriefed
   at the end of the task and thanked for their participation. During
   debriefing, participants were presented with the auditory stimuli they
   were exposed to during the experiment and asked if they were familiar
   with the song or had heard it before in experiment; none replied that
   they were or had.

1.2 Results

   The data for each of the three experiments can be found via the
   following link: https://osf.io/j6hwd/. The basic data pattern for the
   present experiment indicated that CRAT solution rates were higher in
   the quiet condition in comparison with the music condition.
   Furthermore, a greater number of easy CRATs were solved in comparison
   with difficult CRATs. To examine the data further, a 2 (Sound: Quiet
   vs. Spanish Music) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs. Difficult)
   within‐participants analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on mean
   solution rates (i.e., proportion correct). An alpha level of p < 0.05
   was adopted for all statistical tests. There was a significant main
   effect of Sound, F(1, 29) = 9.91, MSE = 0.01, p = 0.004, η[p]^2 = 0.25.
   Significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet condition (M = 0.43,
   SE = 0.04) in comparison with the Spanish music condition (M = 0.36,
   SE = 0.05). There was a main effect of CRAT Difficulty, F(1,
   29) = 63.36, MSE = 0.02, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.67, with significantly
   higher solution rates for the easy CRATs (M = 0.49, SE = 0.04) in
   comparison with the difficult CRATs (M = 0.29, SE = 0.05). There was no
   significant Sound × CRAT Difficulty interaction, F(1, 29) = 1.36,
   MSE = 0.02, p = 0.25, η[p]^2 = 0.05.

1.3 Discussion

   The aim of Experiment 1 was to compare CRAT performance in a quiet
   condition to performance when ignoring background music with unfamiliar
   foreign lyrics. Significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet
   condition relative to the background music condition. As anticipated,
   there was a significant difference in solution rates for the easy
   versus the difficult CRATs. Furthermore, there was no significant
   interaction between Sound and CRAT Difficulty for solution rates. That
   Sound impaired CRAT performance regardless of problem difficulty
   coheres with the findings of Ball and Stevens (2009), who demonstrated
   that articulatory suppression similarly impaired performance with easy
   and difficult tasks. However, the results are inconsistent with the
   general view that music enhances creativity, and dispute the prediction
   that background noise enhances creativity due to the promotion of
   processing disfluency and subsequent encouragement of abstract thought
   (Mehta et al., 2012). That CRAT performance was disrupted by the
   presence of a stimulus that conveyed no meaning to the participants
   precludes a semantic interference‐by‐process explanation of the results
   (cf. Marsh et al., 2008, 2009). However, the results are consistent
   with previous findings, which demonstrate background sounds that are
   meaningless to participants, can impair performance of tasks that
   require verbal working memory components such as serial recall,
   providing they possess appreciable changing‐state properties (e.g.,
   Jones et al., 1990): an acoustic interference‐by‐process (Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000).

2 EXPERIMENT 2

   Experiment 1 identified that music with foreign (unfamiliar) lyrics had
   a detrimental effect on the solution rates of CRATs in comparison with
   a quiet condition. At first glance, this finding is at odds with the
   notion that creative performance can be enhanced in the presence of
   background sound, through encouraging processing disfluency and
   promoting the abstract thought believed to be required to solve CRATs.
   However, Mehta et al. (2012) obtained facilitatory effects on CRAT
   performance with ambient sound comprising “multi‐talker noise in a
   cafeteria, roadside traffic, and distant construction noise to create a
   soundtrack of constantly varying background noise” (p. 786), whereas
   the current study used Spanish music with a clearly discernible voice
   (although in a language foreign to the participant, thereby conveying
   unfamiliar lyrics). We note that the presence of a clearly discernible
   voice could be a key difference between our study and that of Mehta et
   al. (2012) in driving the direction of the effect of background sound
   on creative performance. One possibility is that the presence of
   discernible speech in Experiment 1 could somehow prevent participants
   from achieving the disfluent processing state that could facilitate
   CRAT performance through abstract thought.

   To address this aforementioned issue, Experiment 2 compared a quiet
   background with music without speech (lyrics) to investigate whether
   the presence of speech in some way impedes disfluent processing and
   thus prevents any supposed benefits of such disfluent processing on
   CRAT performance. In terms of the contrasting view that background
   sound can impair creative processing through impairing verbal working
   memory, music without lyrics should impair CRAT performance similarly
   to Spanish music with a discernible voice. In support of this view,
   numerous studies in the context of serial‐verbal short‐term memory
   (Klatte et al., 1995; Klatte et al., 2010; Nittono, 1997; Salamé &
   Baddeley, 1989; Schlittmeier et al., 2008) have shown that the presence
   of speech is not a prerequisite to produce disruption of verbal working
   memory. Thus, on the interference‐by‐process account, music without
   lyrics (speech) would also be expected to disrupt the creative
   processes necessary for solving CRATs and Experiment 2 sought to
   determine whether this was indeed the case.

2.1 Method

2.1.1 Participants

   Eighteen adults (12 female and six male) from the University of Central
   Lancashire aged between 19 and 45 years old participated in the
   experiment (M = 25 years, SD = 9.31). The participants were recruited
   via an opportunity sample and received course credit, or the standard
   department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of participation. All
   participants spoke English as their first language and reported normal
   (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and normal hearing. The experiment
   received Ethical Clearance from the University of Central Lancashire.

2.1.2 Design and materials

   The design and materials were identical to those outlined in Experiment
   1 above, with the exception of a manipulation to one of the levels of
   the within‐participant factors, Sound, which had two levels: Quiet vs.
   Music without Lyrics. The sound used within Experiment 2 was therefore
   the same as that used in Experiment 1, but without the lyrical content.

2.1.3 Procedure

   Each participant read an information sheet and signed a consent form
   prior to beginning the experiment. The procedure remained identical to
   that reported in Experiment 1 outlined above. All participants were
   fully debriefed at the end of the experiment. As with Experiment 1, at
   debriefing, participants were presented with the auditory stimuli they
   were exposed to during the experiment and asked if they were familiar
   with the song or had heard it before the experiment. None of the
   participants reported familiarity with the song, nor hearing it
   previously.

2.2 Results

   The pattern of results in the present experiment replicated that found
   in Experiment 1. CRAT solutions were higher in the quiet condition in
   comparison with the music condition. Furthermore, a greater number of
   easy CRATs were solved in comparison with difficult CRATs. A 2 (Sound:
   Quiet vs. Music without Lyrics) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs.
   Difficult) within‐participants ANOVA was conducted on the dependent
   variable of mean solution rate. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was adopted
   for all statistical tests. There was a significant main effect of
   Sound, F(1, 17) = 8.60, MSE = 0.02, p = 0.009, η[p]^2 = 0.34.
   Significantly more CRATs were solved in the Quiet condition (M = 0.39,
   SE = 0.04) in comparison with the Music without Lyrics condition
   (M = 0.29, SE = 0.03). There was a main effect of CRAT Difficulty, F(1,
   17) = 61.05, MSE = 0.03, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.78, with significantly
   higher solution rates for the easy CRATs (M = 0.48, SE = 0.05) in
   comparison with the difficult CRATs (M = 0.19, SE = 0.03). There was no
   significant Sound × CRAT Difficulty interaction, F(1, 17) = 2.51,
   MSE = 0.02, p = 0.13, η[p]^2 = 0.13.

2.3 Discussion

   The aim of Experiment 2 was to compare CRAT performance in a quiet
   condition versus performance with to‐be‐ignored background music
   without lyrics. This was to investigate whether the presence of speech
   in Experiment 1 produced disruption of CRAT performance, and if this
   effect would hold for music without any speech content (in other words,
   music without lyrics). Experiment 2 supported the findings of
   Experiment 1 in that significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet
   condition in comparison with the music without lyrics condition.
   Consistent with Experiment 1, there was a significant difference in
   solution rates for the easy versus the difficult CRATs. Furthermore,
   there was no significant interaction between Sound and CRAT Difficulty
   for solution rates.

   The results are again inconsistent with the general view that music
   enhances creativity, and instead we demonstrate a deficit to CRAT
   performance in the presence of to‐be‐ignored background music with
   unfamiliar lyrics (Experiment 1) as well as in the absence of lyrics
   (Experiment 2). Moreover, the results oppose the view that background
   noise leads to processing disfluency, which in turn promotes creativity
   by engendering increased abstract thought (Mehta et al., 2012). The
   results run counter to the idea that the failure to find facilitation
   of CRAT performance via background music was due to the presence of
   speech in Experiment 1. Here, we demonstrate in Experiment 2 that music
   without lyrics (i.e., in the absence of any speech content) still
   failed to produce a facilitation in creativity and in fact resulted in
   a decrement in creativity in comparison with a quiet condition.

   Taken together, the findings of Experiments 1 and 2 support the notion
   that verbal working memory is necessary for CRAT performance (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009), and that this is susceptible to disruption by the
   presence of to‐be‐ignored background sound, regardless of whether this
   background sound is speech or nonspeech based (e.g., Jones & Macken,
   1993).

3 EXPERIMENT 3

   As we have discussed in our introduction, both the
   interference‐by‐process view (Jones & Tremblay, 2000) and the
   processing disfluency view (Mehta et al., 2012) eschew the role of mood
   and arousal in mediating the effect of background sound on creative
   task performance. However, there is a compelling literature showing
   that increased mood and arousal that derives from listening to music
   may affect cognitive task performance. For example, Thompson et al.
   (2001) demonstrated a benefit to subsequent visuo‐spatial task
   performance from prior listening to music as compared with exposure to
   quiet that was entirely dependent on the change in mood and arousal
   that the music produced. Furthermore, Ritter and Ferguson (2017)
   reported that music presented 15 s prior to, and concurrently with, the
   performance of a task that involved creative verbal cognition
   facilitated performance on that task. However, this facilitatory effect
   occurred only for “happy” music that engendered positive affect and
   increased arousal. The relationship between happy music and increased
   arousal is usually attributed to the music's higher tempo (Vieillard et
   al., 2008). Moreover, music that is rated as being “liked” is typically
   “happy” music (Husain, Thompson, & Schellenberg, 2002). Therefore, it
   remains possible that given the pleasure that individuals usually
   derive from music, the music one choses to listen to might typically
   induce a positive mood and increased arousal, thereby yielding a
   positive impact on task performance (Thompson et al., 2001),
   particularly for tasks that involve creativity (Ritter & Ferguson,
   2017). Indeed, previous research has established that positive mood can
   improve performance on RATs (Rowe, Hirsh, & Anderson, 2007). In both
   Experiments 1 and 2, our use of arbitrary music with foreign or
   “unfamiliar” lyrics, and music with the absence of lyrics, could have
   induced a neutral or even negative mood state in participants, which
   might have hindered the emergence of creative insight.

   To investigate any potential mediating impact of mood on CRAT
   performance in Experiment 3, participants tackled CRAT problems in the
   presence of music with positive lyrics and fast tempo (approximately
   160 beats per minute), which we considered should increase positive
   affect and arousal. Indeed, research has identified that happy music
   typically has a tempo of around 150 beats per minute; thus, our musical
   condition exceeds this figure (Khalfa, Roy, Rainville, Dalla Bella, &
   Peretz, 2008). Furthermore, “happy” music is known to increase arousal
   (e.g., Salimpoor, Benovoy, Longo, Cooperstock, & Zatorre, 2009). To
   identify support for the assertion that music with a fast tempo is
   perceived as “happy,” we measured mood states at two different time
   points (i.e., before and after each background sound condition) using
   the Profile of Mood States (PoMS) questionnaire (McNair, 1971). In
   Experiment 3, we also acquired data relating to participants' musical
   preferences (i.e., whether they liked or disliked the presented
   background sound) and their study habits (i.e., whether they tend to
   study with music or without background music). These data were intended
   to be peripheral to the main findings, but they nevertheless had the
   capacity to provide an indication of whether the impact of mood on CRAT
   performance is influenced by either musical preference or study habits.

   We also note that in explaining the findings arising in Experiments 1
   and 2, yet another possibility is that the promotion of creativity
   through processing disfluency in the presence of background noise
   (Mehta et al., 2012) is a specific effect that is limited to the
   presence of relatively “steady‐state” sound, unlike the background
   music used in our conditions, which clearly satisfied the criteria for
   “changing‐state” sound. Therefore, in Experiment 3, we included a
   “library noise” condition, which resembled that used by Mehta and
   colleagues (Mehta et al., 2012). We contrasted this library noise
   condition with a music condition (i.e., popular music with familiar
   lyrics) and with a quiet condition.

   In terms of the outcomes of Experiment 3, if the mood and arousal
   account (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017; Thompson et al., 2001) is correct,
   then we expected to observe an increase in CRAT performance in the
   background music condition compared with the quiet and library noise
   conditions, assuming that the music condition reliably increases mood
   and arousal compared with the library noise condition. We note here
   that studies exploring the mood and arousal effect usually present
   music prior to, rather than concurrently with, the cognitive task of
   interest and typically study the effects of these music stimuli on
   visuo‐spatial performance such as mental rotation (Thompson et al.,
   2001). However, effects of music on creative task performance that are
   reportedly mediated through mood and arousal have also been shown when
   music is presented concurrently with the target task in the context of
   a verbally‐based creative task (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017). Moreover,
   participants within mood and arousal studies are free to attend to the
   music, rather than instructed to ignore the background sound, as is the
   case with studies of the irrelevant sound effect (Jones & Macken,
   1993). We make the assumption, however, that changes to mood and
   arousal induced by the presentation of music occurs regardless of
   whether participants are free to attend the music or requested to
   ignore it and explore this proposition.

   The processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012) would predict
   that both library noise and music conditions should increase CRAT
   performance, whereas the modified processing disfluency account only
   predicts a positive effect of background library noise on CRAT
   performance. Finally, the interference‐by‐process view (e.g., Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000) predicts that CRAT performance should be reduced in the
   music condition relative to the library noise and quiet conditions
   because the music condition comprises a changing‐state auditory
   stimulus, whereas the library noise condition constitutes a
   steady‐state stimulus.

3.1 Method

3.1.1 Participants

   Thirty‐six adults (23 female and 13 male) from the University of
   Central Lancashire aged between 19 and 56 years old participated in the
   experiment (M = 24 years, SD = 8.36). The participants were recruited
   via an opportunity sample. Participants received course credit, or the
   standard department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of
   participation. All participants spoke English as their first language
   and reported normal (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and hearing.

3.1.2 Design

   In relation to the assessment of CRAT performance, the design was a 3
   (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy
   vs. Difficult) × 2 (Study Habit: Music vs. No Music) mixed design. For
   the purpose of mood evaluation, the following within‐participants
   design was used to determine mood changes using the PoMs questionnaire:
   3 (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (Time: Before vs.
   After) × 6 (Mood State: Tension vs. Depression vs. Anger vs. Confusion
   vs. Fatigue vs. Vigour). The music chosen for the background sound was
   a popular 2013 mid‐tempo soul and neo‐soul song that contained positive
   lyrics and had an upbeat melody. The library noise consisted of distant
   (nonintelligible) speech, photocopier noise, typing, and rustling of
   papers.

3.1.3 Materials

   Before undertaking the CRATs, participants were asked: “Do you
   ordinarily study in the presence of background music?” and responded
   yes or no. The PoMS questionnaire is designed to measure fluctuating
   feelings and affective states (for further details, see McNair, 1971).
   The questionnaire measures six different aspects of mood state:
   tension, depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour. According
   to instructions of administration, the six mood states can be combined
   in the following way to produce a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score:
   tension + depression + anger + confusion + fatigue − vigour. However,
   for the purposes of this design, we were interested in the specific
   mood profile, and therefore, the six specific profile scores were used
   rather than a general TMD measure (McNair, 1971).

   Using the norming data on solution rate and solution time for 30‐s
   presentation time, an additional set of 19 CRAT problems (10 easy and
   nine difficult) matching accuracy and solution times to Sets A and B
   was selected using the program “Match” (Van Casteren & Davis, 2007) to
   create Set C (solution accuracy M = 47.9%, SD = 25.7, solution times:
   M = 9.6 s, SD = 3.3). The experiment was fully counterbalanced such
   that each CRAT set appeared within each sound condition. After
   undertaking the CRATs, participants were asked: “Did you like the
   music?” and responded yes or no.

3.2 Results

   Like Experiments 1 and 2, the dependent variable was the mean solution
   rate for the CRAT problems. As mentioned in the foregoing, Experiment 3
   included a number of further dependent variables. These were responses
   to the PoMS questionnaires administered before and after the completion
   of each set of CRATs. The PoMS contains measures of six mood states:
   tension, depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour. There was
   also a brief questionnaire related to musical preference (whether
   participants liked the music played during the music condition) and
   study habits (whether they regularly listened to music when studying).
   Twenty‐nine participants responded that they liked the music and seven
   responded that they disliked the music, indicating that the vast
   majority of participants found the music appealing. Furthermore, 18
   participants responded that they ordinarily studied in the presence of
   music, whereas 18 preferred to study without the presence of music.
   Participants were assigned to Music vs. No Music for Study Habit,
   accordingly. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was adopted for all statistical
   tests used.

3.2.1 Solution rates

   The descriptive data for solution rates (see Figure 1) suggested that
   CRATs were more likely to be solved in the quiet and library noise
   conditions, in comparison with the music condition. However, there
   appeared to be no difference in the number of CRATs solved between the
   quiet and library noise conditions. Easy CRATs also seemed to be solved
   more readily than difficult CRATs. To examine these apparent effects
   further, a 3 (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (CRAT
   Difficulty: Easy vs. Difficult) × 2 (Study Habit: Music vs. No Music)
   mixed ANOVA was conducted on the solution rate data. There was a
   significant main effect of Sound on solution rates, F(2, 68) = 7.08,
   MSE = 0.07, p = 0.002, η[p]^2 = 0.12. Pairwise comparisons revealed
   that significantly more CRATs were solved in the Quiet condition
   (M = 0.34, SE = 0.05) in comparison with the Music condition (M = 0.30,
   SE = 0.04, p = 0.002). There were also significantly more CRATs solved
   in the Library Noise condition (M = 0.37, SE = 0.04, p = 0.003) in
   comparison with the Music condition. However, there was no significant
   difference between the mean number of CRATs solved in the Quiet and
   Library Noise conditions (p = 0.70).

   As expected, there was a significant main effect of CRAT difficulty on
   solution rates, F(1, 34) = 218.13.75, MSE = 0.02, p < 0.001,
   η[p]^2 = 0.87, with significantly more easy CRATs solved (M = 0.48,
   SE = 0.04) than difficult CRATs (M = 0.19, SE = 0.04). There was also
   no significant main effect of Study Habit on CRAT solution times, F(1,
   32) = 0.01, MSE = 0.26, p = 0.93, η[p]^2 = 0.000. Participants who
   specified that they preferred to study without music (M = 0.34,
   SE = 0.05) did not solve significantly more CRATs than those who
   specified that they preferred to study with music (M = 0.34,
   SE = 0.05). The remaining interactions and three‐way interactions all
   failed to reach significance (all ps > 0.05).

3.2.2 PoMs questionnaire

   To ascertain any changes in mood before and after completing the CRATs
   in each sound condition, a PoMS questionnaire was administered to
   participants at two different points (before and after completing the
   CRATs in each of the three sound conditions). Therefore, each
   participant completed the PoMS questionnaire a total of six times. A 3
   (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (Time: Before vs.
   After) × 6 (Mood State: Tension vs. Depression vs. Anger vs. Confusion
   vs. Fatigue vs. Vigour) within‐participants ANOVA was conducted on the
   mood state scores. The ANOVA revealed that there was no significant
   main effect of Sound, F(2, 70) = 1.66, MSE = 0.20, p = 0.20,
   η[p]^2 = 0.05, with no significant difference in the mean mood state
   score in the Quiet (M = 5.89, SE = 0.54), Music (M = 5.65, SE = 0.58),
   and Library Noise (M = 6.10, SE = 0.54) conditions. There was a main
   effect of Time, F(1, 35) = 6.10, MSE = 9.98, p = 0.02, η[p]^2 = 0.15,
   with mean mood state scores significantly higher Before (M = 6.10,
   SE = 0.58) in comparison with After (M = 5.66, SE = 0.49) completing
   the CRATs. There was a significant main effect of Mood, F(5,
   175) = 28.17, MSE = 80.60, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.45. Pairwise
   comparisons indicated that there were significant differences between
   all mood states with the exception of tension (M = 5.05, SE = 0.67)
   versus fatigue (M = 5.13, SE = 0.78), depression (M = 2.86, SE = 0.87)
   versus anger (M = 5.13, SE = 0.78), anger versus fatigue, and fatigue
   versus vigour (M = 11.96, SE = 0.91; all ps > 0.05). There was no
   significant Sound × Time interaction, F(2, 70) = 2.43, MSE = 11.88,
   p = 0.10, η[p]^2 = 0.07, Sound × Mood interaction, F(10, 350) = 1.42,
   MSE = 8.25, p = 0.10, η[p]^2 = 0.07, or Time × Mood interaction, F(5,
   175) = 0.48, MSE = 5.18, p = 0.79, η[p]^2 = 0.01.

   As expected, there was a significant three‐way Sound × Time × Mood
   interaction, F(10, 350) = 3.50, MSE = 5.846, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.09.
   Pairwise comparisons indicated the source of this significant
   interaction. For the Quiet condition, there was no significant change
   in any of the mood states after completing the CRATs (all ps > 0.05).
   However, for the Music condition, there was a significant change in
   mood for four out of the six mood states. There was a significant
   decrease in tension (M = 5.36, SE = 0.82 vs. M = 4.00, SE = 0.69,
   p = 0.01), anger (M = 4.08, SE = 1.04 vs. M = 2.72, SE = 0.69,
   p = 0.049), confusion (M = 6.92, SE = 0.75 vs. M = 5.69, SE = 0.59,
   p = 0.02), and fatigue (M = 4.81, SE = 0.87 vs. M = 3.72, SE = 0.80,
   p = 0.03). There was no significant change in depression (M = 3.25,
   SE = 1.23 vs. M = 2.61, SE = 0.98, p = 0.33) or vigour (M = 11.86,
   SE = 0.97 vs. M = 12.72, SE = 1.13, p = 0.22). For the Library Noise
   condition, there was no significant change in five of the six mood
   states (all ps > 0.05). However, there was a significant decrease in
   vigour (M = 12.67, SE = 1.08 vs. M = 10.67, SE = 0.94, p < 0.001).

   These findings indicate that the significant changes in mood states
   before and after completing CRATs occurred within the Music condition
   and not in the Quiet or Library Noise condition, thus indicating that
   music altered a number of mood states, and as measured by the PoMS,
   provided a general increase in positive mood. Since previous research
   (Rowe et al., 2007) has shown that positive mood can improve
   performance on RATs, the present observation that music increased mood
   but decreased CRAT performance suggests that a mood‐based explanation
   of the detrimental effect of music on creative insight seems
   implausible.

3.2.3 PoMs and solution rates

   In the previous section, the PoMS scores and CRAT solution rates were
   examined independently. However, it is useful to consider the possible
   impact of mood as a mediating influence on the relationship between
   to‐be‐ignored background sound and CRAT performance. Unfortunately, the
   current dataset is unsuitable for mediation analysis (i.e., to
   ascertain mood as a possible direct or indirect mediator in the
   relationship between background sound and CRAT performance) given the
   implementation of Sound as a within‐participants factor rather than a
   between‐participants factor. However, an analysis of covariance was
   performed to examine CRAT solution rates when mood score was included
   as a covariate. Here, we focused on the relationship between the quiet
   and music conditions, given our particular interest in the disruption
   caused by to‐be‐ignored background music.

   In order to establish the mood score for entry as a covariate, the
   “before” score for each of the six mood score dimensions (tension,
   depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour) was subtracted from
   the “after” score to provide a “mood change” score for each of the six
   profile of mood state dimensions listed above. This resulted in a mood
   state dimension change score for both the music and quiet conditions,
   for each mood state (tension, depression, anger, confusion, anger, and
   vigour). The change score for the music condition was subtracted from
   the change score for the quiet condition, to provide a single change
   score for each of the six mood states. A 2 × 2 analysis of covariance
   was conducted (Sound: Quiet vs. Music) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs.
   Difficult) on solution rates, with tension, depression, anger,
   confusion, fatigue, and vigour each entered as a covariate. The
   findings revealed that all covariates failed to reach significance (all
   ps > 0.05), indicating that each of the six mood state measures failed
   to have a significant impact on CRAT solution rates, either directly or
   in interaction with the Sound and CRAT Difficulty factors.

3.3 Discussion

   Experiment 3 demonstrated that popular music with familiar lyrics
   disrupted CRAT performance (in terms of solution rates) in comparison
   with a quiet condition or library noise condition. However, there was
   no significant difference in CRAT performance between the quiet and
   library noise conditions. Mehta et al. (2012) previously demonstrated a
   beneficial effect to creativity with what could be termed “steady‐state
   sound.” Although these findings demonstrate that a steady‐state sound
   such as library noise does not result in a relative enhancement to
   creativity, we also find that the decrement was not significant,
   particularly in comparison with the background music with familiar
   lyrics.

   Furthermore, the findings imply that music with familiar lyrics
   resulted in a decrement in CRAT performance, despite an apparent
   overall positive increase in mood as identified by six mood states
   recognised in the PoMS. Given that previous research has identified
   that positive mood can lead to an improvement in RAT scores (Rowe et
   al., 2007), the findings here demonstrate that the decrement in
   performance in the music condition does not appear to be driven by
   mood. Indeed, these findings further support the notion that CRAT
   performance relies on verbal working memory, and that this is
   susceptible to disruption by nonsteady‐state sound, with or without the
   presence of speech.

4 GENERAL DISCUSSION

   In a series of three experiments, we investigated the impact of
   background music (with varying semantic properties) on creativity, as
   measured by performance on CRATs. In Experiment 1, background music
   with foreign (and therefore “unfamiliar”) lyrics resulted in a
   significant decrement to CRAT performance; significantly fewer CRATs
   were solved in the music with foreign lyrics condition in comparison
   with the quiet condition. This finding was replicated in Experiment 2
   with the implementation of background instrumental music in comparison
   with a quiet condition. In Experiment 3, familiar music was found to
   impair CRAT performance regardless of whether the music induced a
   positive mood or whether those participants typically studied in the
   presence of music. Moreover, disruption occurred despite the fact that
   the music was liked by the participants, which coheres with the
   findings of Perham and Vizard (2010) and Perham and Currie (2014), who
   showed equivalent disruption by liked and disliked background music in
   the context of serial recall and reading comprehension, respectively.

   Prior to discussing the implications of Experiments 1 to 3 for the
   theoretical accounts entertained, we undertook a Bayesian meta‐analysis
   of the collective findings. Bayes factors were calculated to quantify
   the evidence for two hypotheses: the hypothesis from the processing
   disfluency account (cf. Mehta et al., 2012) that CRAT performance would
   be better in the music conditions relative to the quiet conditions
   (H1), and the hypothesis from the auditory distraction account (Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000) that CRAT performance would be better in the quiet
   conditions relative to the music condition (H2).

   To calculate Bayes factors, one must specify the plausibility of effect
   sizes given one's theory. For both H1 and H2, we model the sort of
   effect size considered plausible on the results of Mehta et al. (2012),
   who reported that hearing a moderate level of noise resulted in
   participants solving a significantly greater proportion of RATs
   (M = 0.73) than participants in the quiet control condition (M = 0.56).
   These results provide an approximate effect size that could be expected
   for a noise manipulation (such as music) on measures of creativity,
   from 0.73 to 0.56 = 0.17. Following Dienes' (2011, 2014) guidelines,
   the experimental hypotheses in the current analyses were modelled using
   a half‐normal distribution with a mode of 0 and a standard deviation of
   0.17. Bayes factors <0.33 are interpreted as moderate evidence for the
   null hypothesis and Bayes factors >3 as moderate evidence for the
   experimental hypotheses. Bayes factors around 1 are conventionally
   considered inconclusive (Dienes, 2011, 2014). Bayes factors were
   calculated using Dienes and McLatchie's (2018) calculator (results
   following each experiment are reported on each row of Table 1).

   Individually, there was strong evidence across all three studies for H0
   relative to H1, indicating that playing music did not enhance
   creativity as measured by CRAT performance (see Table 1). In contrast,
   there was moderate to strong evidence from all three studies for H2
   relative to H0, suggesting that music decreased creativity to
   approximately the same extent one might have expected it to have
   increased (again refer to Table 1).

       2012; Experiment 1). CRAT: Compound Remote Associate Task.

   The experiment‐level analyses were followed up with a fixed‐effects
   meta‐analysis using Dienes' (2008) calculator (see Goh, Hall, &
   Rosenthal, 2016, for an overview of the benefits of including internal
   meta‐analyses within studies). The meta‐analytic posterior distribution
   (M = −0.06, SD = 0.01; 95% CI [−0.08, −0.03]) provides the best
   estimate of the population parameter and its uncertainty in light of
   all three studies. The meta‐analysis suggests that music reduces
   creativity as measured using the CRAT. Bayes factors were calculated on
   the meta‐analytic data to test H1 and H2 and revealed that the overall
   body of evidence provided substantial support for H2, that the presence
   of music diminishes rather than enhances creativity, B[H2/H1(0, 0.17)]
   = 3.36 × 10^4, thereby supporting the interference‐by‐process account
   (Jones & Tremblay, 2000) over the processing disfluency account (Mehta
   et al., 2012).

   Taken together, the findings from Experiments 1 to 3, supported by our
   Bayesian meta‐analysis, contradict the popular opinion that background
   music enhances creativity. Instead, they demonstrate that background
   music, with or without familiar semantic content (i.e., lyrics), or in
   the absence of speech, disrupts performance on CRATs, which represent a
   class of highly researched verbal problem solving tasks that are often
   solved creatively through insight‐based processes. Furthermore, the
   findings of Experiments 1 to 3 undermine the processing disfluency
   account (Mehta et al., 2012), which predicts superior performance in
   the presence of moderate intensity background noise in comparison with
   quiet. We note that a reprieve for the account might be offered if one
   were to assume that music (at least pleasant music) impairs creativity
   via inducing processing fluency (Mehta et al., 2012, p. 796). However,
   it is not immediately obvious why, on the processing disfluency
   account, noise and music should differ in relation to the processing
   fluency that they hypothetically engender.

   We contend that the deficit in CRAT performance in the presence of
   background music appears altogether more consistent with the
   interference‐by‐process framework (e.g., Marsh et al., 2009) than with
   the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012). According to
   the interference‐by‐process approach, the disruption of CRAT
   performance is attributable to the changing‐state effect, which refers
   to the finding that a changing sequence of sound (regardless of whether
   the changes occur on a speech or nonspeech carrier), disrupts serial
   recall to a far greater extent than a nonchanging or steady‐state sound
   (e.g., a repeated token or tone; Jones & Macken, 1993; Jones et al.,
   1992). The pre‐attentive perception of changes between elements in the
   sound, as a by‐product of acoustic‐based perceptual organisation
   processes (Bregman, 1990), gives rise to irrelevant order cues. These
   cues compete with the process responsible for subvocally maintaining
   the to‐be‐remembered items in sequence. In support of this suggestion,
   we have recently found that changing‐state letters (c, t, g, u) produce
   more disruption to CRAT performance than steady‐state letters (c, c, c,
   c; Marsh, Threadgold, Barker, & Ball, 2017). Music, of course, is a
   changing‐state, rather than a steady‐state, sound. Therefore, the
   findings presented here, which attest to the disruption to verbal
   insight problem solving as measured through CRAT performance, are
   entirely consistent with findings that have revealed a disruption to
   serial recall by changing‐state sounds that include music (e.g., Perham
   & Vizard, 2010). Furthermore, the findings imply that the presence or
   absence of semantic content (i.e., lyrics)—and indeed the familiarity
   of the lyrics (e.g., lyrics in foreign and unfamiliar language)—does
   not alter the disruptive influence of background music. Moreover, that
   background music successfully increased mood and arousal in Experiment
   3, but led to poorer, rather than better, CRAT performance compared
   with the quiet control and library noise condition undermines the mood
   and arousal account (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017; Schellenberg et al.,
   2007).

   One explanation for why background music impairs CRAT performance in
   the same way as it impairs serial recall (e.g., Salamé & Baddeley,
   1989) relates to the processes of verbal working memory and their
   importance for insight problem solving. Indeed, Ball and Stevens (2009)
   identified a strong verbal component to the solving of insight‐based
   CRATs, in that implementing a “think aloud” process during problem
   solving reliably enhanced solution rates. If verbal working memory is
   important for CRAT performance, and any nonsteady‐state background
   sound (such as music) is disruptive to the creative and analytic
   processes necessary to solve CRATs, a decrement to CRAT performance
   would be expected. This, therefore, suggests that it is not the type of
   semantic content within the to‐be‐ignored background per se that is
   disruptive to insight problem solving, but rather the presence of
   changing‐state sound and its impact on verbal working memory processes
   (such as rehearsal) underpinning the solving of CRATs. It might be, for
   example, that participants rehearse various target solutions, before
   obtaining an appropriate solution word. For example, for the problem
   “house,” “pear,” and “family,” it might be the case that “tree‐house”
   and “pear‐tree” are rehearsed, whereas participants test out the
   viability of another generated word, including the solution,
   “family‐tree.” That solution words can either serve as a prefix or a
   suffix to problem words may reinforce the rehearsal strategy because
   order processing is necessary to obtain an appropriate solution
   (“tree‐pear” being an appropriate combination of the problem and
   solution word but in the reverse order). However, because semantic
   associative processes are likely to be involved in CRAT solving (Smith
   et al., 2013), it would be reasonable to predict that meaningful
   background speech in a participant's mother tongue, as compared with
   meaningless background speech (speech in a language foreign to the
   participant), could produce additional disruption to CRAT solving,
   superimposed on the changing‐state effect, as a consequence of a
   semantic interference‐by‐process. The general notion is that disruption
   over and above the changing‐state effect can occur when there is a
   conflict between semantic processing of the sound and semantic
   processing in the focal task (Jones et al., 2012; Marsh et al., 2009).
   For example, in the context of mental arithmetic, Perham, Marsh,
   Clarkson, Lawrence, and Sörqvist (2016) argued that the additional
   disruption due to an ascending sequence of number distracters as
   compared with a random sequence was produced due to an additional
   priming process that was superimposed upon the interference‐by‐process
   that underpinned the changing‐state effect.

   One challenge that stems from the finding that background music impairs
   CRAT solving relates to determining the generalisability of the
   observed effect beyond CRATs alone. CRATs are but one example of a
   verbal insight problem solving task, albeit a popular and widely used
   example that is believed to provide an effective test of creativity
   (e.g., Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 1998; Mednick, 1962). However, many other
   types of verbal and non‐verbal insight problem solving tasks exist
   (e.g., see Gilhooly, Fioratou, & Henretty, 2010). An important
   consideration is to what extent do the explanations presented here in
   terms of interference‐by‐process and working memory generalise to
   further insight problem solving tasks in both the verbal and visual
   domain?

   In relation to this latter question, preliminary evidence from Ball,
   Marsh, Litchfield, Cook, and Booth (2015) suggests that non‐verbal
   (i.e., visuo‐spatial) insight problem solving may in fact be
   facilitated, rather than hampered by background sound. Participants
   solved “classic” non‐verbal insight problems (such as the pigs‐in‐pens
   problem; see Schooler, Ohlsson, & Brooks, 1993) more accurately, and
   faster, when background sound was presented (in a form that involved
   repeated, canonical counting of the digit sequence 1 to 7) compared
   with a quiet background. According to Ball et al. (2015), these results
   can be interpreted in terms of background sound impairing inner speech,
   thereby permitting the operation of nonreportable, “special processes”
   (e.g., problem restructuring) that are critical for enabling successful
   solutions to emerge in classic insight‐based problem solving tasks
   involving predominantly visuo‐spatial components. It is our conjecture
   that background music would have a similar positive effect to this, yet
   it would be the changing‐state properties of the to‐be‐ignored
   background music, rather than the music per se, that would underpin an
   apparent enhancement in creativity. In sum, boundary effects are likely
   to be evident in terms of the following: (a) the relationship between
   background music and creativity; (b) the negative consequences of
   background music on verbal insight problem solving tasks as
   demonstrated here with CRATs; and (c) the positive consequences on
   visuo‐spatial insight problem solving tasks (e.g., Ball et al., 2015).

   One further point of consideration is that Mehta et al. (2012) found
   facilitatory effects of background sound for a number of different
   tasks that are thought to tap creativity. Although we found no evidence
   for the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012) in the
   context of our current study, it is possible that other tasks, or their
   component processes, are more sensitive to the potential engendering of
   processing disfluency—and thus enhancement of cognition—via the
   presence of background noise. Arriving at a CRAT solution may involve
   multiple processes that include a delicate balance between top‐down
   processes (e.g., rehearsal and executive control, such as inhibition in
   the case of excluding incorrect response candidates) and bottom‐up
   processes, such as spreading activation in associative, semantic
   networks that provide the candidate responses (cf. Benedek et al.,
   2016). Because it is likely that the balance between these top‐down and
   bottom‐up processes may differ substantially between different insight
   problems, different susceptibility to distraction by background sound
   is likely across different types of problem solving tasks solved via a
   process of insight. In this way, it is possible that any advantage to
   creative problem solving promoted by processing disfluency due to the
   presence of background noise may be dependent upon the particular
   strategy and processes used to solve a CRAT. It is reasonable to
   suggest that such strategies and processes could differ on a
   problem‐by‐problem basis.

   Although we argue that our results can be explained in terms of the
   interference‐by‐process account (Jones & Tremblay, 2000), it is
   important to note that there are two competing explanations for a
   deficit in CRAT performance with background noise, which both stem from
   well‐established theories of creativity. One such explanation derives
   from the “broad attentional scope” (BAS) view of creativity (Zabelina,
   O'Leary, Pornpattananangkul, Nusslock, & Beaman, 2015), whereas the
   other derives from the “focused attentional scope” (FAS) perspective
   (Gilhooly, Fioratou, Anthony, & Wynn, 2007). The BAS view supposes that
   background sound may reduce the overall amount of attention that one
   can apply to the problem solving task, resulting in a diffuse
   attentional state that can facilitate insight problem solving (Jarosz,
   Colflesh, & Wiley, 2012). In comparison, the FAS view proposes that if
   background sound reduces overall attention, then insight problem
   solving will be impaired. This FAS view is consistent with theories of
   distraction that assume the presence of background sound captures
   attention away from the focal task (Cowan, 1995) or reduces the overall
   amount of attention applied to the focal task (Neath, 2000), thus
   impairing observed performance. Across three experiments, we
   demonstrate a deficit to CRAT performance with distraction via
   to‐be‐ignored background music. Such a deficit to creativity is
   consistent with the importance of FAS in verbal insight problem solving
   such as with CRATs.

   One might assume that the findings reported here suggest that a
   disruption to FAS is generated by to‐be‐ignored background music, and
   that this is disruptive to the analytic and associative processes
   necessary to solve insight problems. However, there are two key
   problems with this assumption. First, there was nothing inherent within
   the presented background sound that was likely to capture attention and
   thus disrupt the attention directed towards the task at hand. Moreover,
   the notion that the overall amount of attention that could be applied
   to the focal task is reduced in the presence of background sound is
   inconsistent with the literature showing that only tasks that require
   verbal rehearsal are susceptible to distraction (Beaman & Jones, 1997;
   Jones & Macken, 1993). Second, if background sound impaired a focused
   attentional state necessary to solve insight problem solving tasks,
   then one would expect disruption, not facilitation, on tasks that
   require visuo‐spatial insight problem solving, similar to that found
   with verbal insight problem solving. However, evidence from Ball et al.
   (2015) and the findings presented here suggest a dissociation in the
   facilitatory and disruptive effects of to‐be‐ignored background sound
   on verbal and visuo‐spatial insight problems, respectively.

   To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music
   enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of
   the presence of semantic content (no lyrics, familiar lyrics, or
   unfamiliar lyrics), consistently disrupts creative performance in
   insight problem solving as measured by CRATs.

Abstract

   Characters which are closely linked to fitness often have low
   heritabilities (V[A]/V[P]). Low heritabilities could be because of low
   additive genetic variation (V[A]), that had been depleted by
   directional selection. Alternatively, low heritabilities may be caused
   by large residual variation (V[R]=V[P] – V[A]) compounded at a
   disproportionately higher rate than V[A] across integrated characters.
   Both hypotheses assume that each component of quantitative variation
   has an independent effect on heritability. However, V[A] and V[R] may
   also covary, in which case differences in heritability cannot be fully
   explained by the independent effects of elimination‐selection or
   compounded residual variation.

   We compared the central tendency of published behavioural
   heritabilities (mean=0.31, median=0.23) with morphological and life
   history data collected by 26). Average behavioural heritability was not
   significantly different from average life history heritability, but
   both were smaller than average morphological heritability. We
   cross‐classified behavioural traits to test whether variation in
   heritability was related to selection (dominance, domestic/wild) or
   variance compounding (integration level). There was a significant
   three‐way interaction between indices of selection and variance
   compounding, related to the absence of either effect at the highest
   integration level. At lower integration levels, high dominance variance
   indicated effects of selection. It was also indicated by the low CV[A]
   of domestic species. At the same time CV[R] increased
   disproportionately faster than CV[A] across integration levels,
   demonstrating variance compounding. However, neither CV[R] nor CV[A]
   had a predominant effect on heritability. The partial regression
   coefficients of CV[R] and CV[A] on heritability were similar and a path
   analysis indicated that their (positive) correlation was also necessary
   to explain variation in heritability. These results suggest that
   relationships between additive genetic and residual components of
   quantitative genetic variation can constrain their independent direct
   effects on behavioural heritability.

Introduction

   8) argued there is a connection between the nature of a character and
   the magnitude of its heritability: characters with the lowest
   heritabilities are those most closely connected with fitness, whereas
   characters with the highest heritabilities are the least connected to
   fitness. This has been repeatedly confirmed (26; 32; 12, p. 470) and
   has been widely interpreted as evidence for Fisher's fundamental
   theorem. The standard interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem is
   that additive genetic variation (V[A]) of fitness‐related traits should
   be low as alleles directly regulating fitness will be rapidly fixed by
   elimination selection (23). It follows that heritability
   (h^2=V[A]/V[P]) of a character should decrease with the strength of its
   relationship to fitness, and empirical studies have repeatedly
   supported this prediction (10; 26; 16; 19; 24). However, 28) and 7)
   argue that Fisher's fundamental theorem did not apply to mean
   reproductive fitness of a population, but describes the partial change
   in fitness due to changes in gene frequency at a single locus.
   Regardless of Fisher's intent, directional selection on a phenotypic
   character can reduce its additive genetic variation (9; 31). Thus,
   negative relationships between a character's heritability and its
   relationship with fitness (10; 19; 24) suggest the magnitude of
   heritability reflects the nature of selection on a character
   (elimination‐selection hypothesis –16, 17) and indicates the level of a
   character's additive genetic variation (V[A]).

   At the same time, quantitative trait structure (number of component
   characters and their relationships) has both a positive effect on
   additive genetic variance (thereby increasing V[A]/V[P]), and a
   negative effect on heritability estimates through increased residual
   variance (V[R]=V[P] – V[A]) in its denominator. Both additive genetic
   and residual life history variation may be integrated across related
   component (i.e. morphological) traits (15; 29) and residual variation
   may be compounded through ontogeny (2) reported that mean standardized
   estimates of additive genetic trait variation (CV[A]– additive genetic
   coefficient of variation) are higher on average in life history than in
   morphological characters and this result has been confirmed in two wild
   populations (19; 24). The idea that life history traits compound
   effects of larger numbers of loci is also supported by the higher
   mutational variation of life history characters compared with
   morphological characters (18; 17). Thus, the effect of compounded
   residual variation in life history characters must be
   disproportionately large and practically independent of (compounded)
   additive genetic variation to explain why their heritabilities are
   smaller on average than those of morphological characters (24).
   Repeated observation of larger differences in residual variation (16;
   27; 19; 24) imply that the difference between heritabilities of these
   character categories occurs in spite of their higher average levels of
   additive genetic variation, and because of their differences in V[R],
   measured by the coefficient of residual variation (CV[R]–16; 18; 23,
   24). However, in each of the studies cited above, there are strong
   positive correlations between CV[A] and CV[R] which may constrain their
   independent effects on heritability.

   Tests of elimination‐selection and variance compounding hypotheses
   contrast expectations of the difference between morphological and life
   history characters. Behavioural characters are excluded from these
   analyses, possibly because their relationship to fitness is not certain
   (16), and in practice because the number of available estimates is
   typically low (26; 14). Nonetheless, 13) summarized the presumed
   relationships of behavioural categories, classified by the number of
   other component behaviours that they integrate (integration level) and
   their relationship with fitness. For instance, Henderson argues that
   mating behaviour, parental care and foraging behaviour integrate a
   large number of component characters such as reflex and display
   behaviours. 13) also argues that highly integrated behaviours are
   closely related to fitness. All else being equal, he suggests that
   elimination‐selection should reduce additive variation most strongly in
   highly integrated behaviours. In other words, they should have lower
   CV[A] and heritability. Applying variance compounding hypotheses to
   behavioural traits suggests that residual variation should be the
   highest among highly integrated behaviours, or they should have higher
   CV[R] and lower heritability. At the same time, the positive covariance
   between residual and additive genetic variation may constrain the
   expected independent effects of additive genetic and residual variation
   on heritability of behavioural characters.

   We compiled estimates of heritability published after 1988 to collect a
   large enough sample size to test Falconer's hypothesis that the nature
   of a character determines its heritability. We first tested whether (1)
   behavioural heritabilities are different on average than either life
   history or morphological heritabilities (26; 31) and (2) that CV[A] and
   CV[R] estimates have significant, independent (CV[A]– positive, CV[R]–
   negative) effects on behavioural heritability estimates. We then (3)
   used behavioural ecology categories to classify heritabilities, CV[A]
   and CV[R] by their presumed relationship with reproductive fitness. We
   also (4) indirectly test whether selection regulates heritability given
   that stronger selection should increase dominance variation (4; 23).
   Finally, we cross‐classified these traits by their integration level
   (or differences in structure) to test whether (5) selection and
   structure have independent effects on average heritability. In summary,
   our interest is not only in determining whether quantitative estimates
   of genetic variation vary between different categories of behaviour,
   but also in testing in one study the presumed effects of both selection
   and structure on the genetic architecture of behaviour.

Methods

Data sources

   We used heritability of morphology and life history estimates reported
   by 26) to test whether behavioural heritability is larger on average
   than life history heritability and smaller than average morphological
   heritability (26; 14). We collected 428 behavioural heritability
   estimates from 79 reports not cited in 26) or 32), published up to the
   year 2000 (Table 1). Unlike 26) we included both broad and narrow sense
   estimates of heritability and we collected estimates made on both
   domestic and wild species. Behavioural heritability estimates were
   reported for vertebrates (mammals, fish, reptiles, birds) and
   invertebrates (insects and crustaceans). 26) and 32) previously
   collected 154 estimates. We first tested whether both data sets (recent
   and older) differed in central tendency.
   Table 1. Species, it's classification and the literature source for the
   recent behavioural heritabilities and CV's compiled in this study. Each
   species was classified as wild (w), domestic (d), or semidomestic (s)
   based on the source of the population, the description of its
   maintenance and the purpose of the study. image
   Table 1. (Contd.) image

   We used an average heritability estimate if there were multiple
   estimates of heritability for one population in the same environment.
   Similarly, if trait heritability was estimated separately for males and
   females in a single study, then we averaged the two estimates. But, if
   the heritability of a trait was estimated for two different populations
   of the same species, or for the same population in different
   environments, then we included both estimates. 26) reported that
   differences between invertebrates and vertebrates were nonsignificant.
   We found similar results for behavioural characters listed in Table 1
   (invertebrate: h^2 ± SE=0.30 ± 0.02 vertebrate: 0.27 ± 0.02;
   t[580]=0.85, P=n.s.). In general, we do not have a priori expectations
   that species or higher level taxa should differ in their average
   heritability. But, heritability estimates may be affected by
   domestication or long‐term maintenance under laboratory conditions.

Analysis

   26) found that central tendency of behavioural and life history
   heritabilities did not differ when they used means and medians as the
   test statistic, and they suggested the low sample size of behavioural
   traits may have led to this result. Based on 26) data we estimated that
   the minimum sample size required to reject the null hypothesis at
   α=0.05 should be 946 (35). Our combined life history and behavioural
   trait sample size was 931. We added the life history estimates reported
   by 19), 24), 14) and 25) so that our final sample size was 948. Thus,
   our parametric hypothesis test should be powerful enough to reject the
   null hypothesis that life history and behavioural heritabilities are
   not significantly different. We used both parametric (ANOVA, Welch
   ANOVA, t‐test) and a median test for testing the significance of
   differences in central tendency. Welch's ANOVA uses an F statistic with
   degrees of freedom that are adjusted for unequal variances. We used the
   Welch ANOVA for our parametric tests of CV[A] and CV[R] categories, as
   category variance estimates differed widely and Welch ANOVA is not
   sensitive to violations of variance homogeneity (6). The median test
   compares the significance of differences between medians of each
   category relative to a combined or grand median. Although it is not as
   powerful as a parametric test, it tests the significance of differences
   in population medians (35), which in a skewed population can be a
   better measure of central tendency.

Classification methods

   Our data set comprised a wide variety of behavioural traits, ranging
   from behaviour closely associated with life history (e.g. predator
   avoidance, mating preferences, oviposition behaviour) to traits with
   domestic or economic importance, but little direct ecological relevance
   (e.g. trot stride).

Wild, domestic, semidomestic

   There were few (3) field estimates of behavioural heritability. Almost
   all of the measurements were collected in a laboratory or farm
   environment. If a species or a population had not been selected for an
   economic purpose, we classified their heritability estimates as `wild'.
   In this respect our terminology is consistent with 26) classification,
   although `nondomestic' may be a better description. Included in this
   category were a number of heritabilities estimated for populations
   which may have been maintained under laboratory conditions for a large
   number of generations (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster). These may not
   have been subjected to artificial selection intentionally, but
   heritability estimates could reflect ongoing adaptation to their
   maintenance conditions (11). For example, heritability estimates for
   Drosophila (32; 14) are lower in each trait category than the averages
   for wild (nondomestic) populations (26). We classified these
   populations as semidomestic and the remaining populations as domestic.

Estimation method

   Additive genetic variation could be estimated using broad sense and
   full sib breeding designs which include all or part of the dominance
   variance component and the between – family environmental component.
   These variance components are not included in half sib, maximum
   likelihood or regression estimates. Consequently, we expect the former
   heritability estimates should be higher on average than the latter and
   interpret the difference between them as an index of the strength of
   recent selection (5; 22; 4). Similar reasoning suggests domestic
   behaviours should also have higher levels of dominance than wild
   behaviours (26; 4). There were eight estimation methods in our combined
   data set: ANOVA (n=69); broad sense (n=49); full sib (n=63); half sib
   (n=172); maximum likelihood animal models (n=25); regression techniques
   (n=69); diallel cross (n=58); and selection studies (n=76). We dropped
   the diallel cross data from this analysis because it consisted almost
   entirely of data from one study.

Behavioural ecology trait types

   Different phenotype categories (morphology, life history, behaviour,
   etc.) may have different heritabilities because of their relationship
   with fitness (8; 26; 14). Following this logic, different categories of
   behaviour thought to be more or less closely related to fitness should
   also have different heritabilities. We classified traits into seven
   behavioural ecology categories (foraging, movement, predator avoidance,
   reproduction, social, temperament, plus one category for other traits).
   In testing variation among levels of this factor, we are interested in
   category averages rather than the heritability of a behaviour in a
   particular population that may or may not have been under directional,
   correllated or stabilizing selection.

Integration level

   13) argued that there is a hierarchy of behavioural phenotypes that
   differ in their level of analysis (see his Fig. 14‐1). Basic, narrowly
   defined phenotypes such as sensory responses, conditioned responses or
   reflexive behaviour having relatively few morphological or other
   behavioural components, were put into the low integration level
   category. Alternatively, sexual, maternal and foraging behaviour
   integrate morphological and other behavioural traits. We assigned these
   to the high integration level category. Traits which comprised
   behavioural clusters (e.g. activity level) but that we could not
   unambiguously assign to high integration level, we designated as
   `medium' integration level. 13) argues that selection should counteract
   the compounded (genetic) effects of pleiotropy and epistasis at higher
   integration levels. But, variance compounding hypotheses imply that
   residual variation should increase disproportionately faster than
   additive genetic variation with integration level. Thus, both
   mechanisms predict heritability should decrease with an increase in
   integration level.

Comparisons using mean‐standardized CV

   Variation in heritability could be due to additive genetic or
   environmental variation (16). 16) proposed reporting coefficients of
   genetic inline image variation as an index of a trait's evolutionary
   potential (evolvability) and level of genetic variation, in addition to
   the residual variation inline image which measures the nonadditive
   genetic and environmental variation. From our literature‐compiled data
   we collected reported CVs, or calculated CV[A] and CV[R] when
   heritability, phenotypic variance, or standard deviation, and the trait
   means traits were reported. Based on the literature, we expect that:
   CV[A] will have a positive relationship with heritability; CV[R] will
   have a negative relationship with heritability; and that CV[A] and
   CV[R]will covary positively. We used mean‐standardized CV (CV[A],
   CV[R]) as the dependent variable with the classification factors
   described above, to test the expected effects of selection and
   structure.

Scale effects

   29) point out that comparing the additive variance of life history and
   morphologial traits may be misleading because they are measured in
   different phenotypic units. Within a phenotype category such as
   behaviour, this problem is less important. Furthermore the data (h^2,
   CV[A], CV[R]) are all on a ratio scale and are independent of the unit
   of measurement. However, error measurements (33), mathematical
   constraints (20) and proportional relationships between mean and
   variance on an arithmetic scale may each generate apparent differences
   in coefficients of variation (8), rather than the biological processes
   such as selection or variance compounding (1; 16). If error
   measurements do not scale to character size, there will be a negative
   relationship between means and variances (33). A mathematical
   constraint may also cause a negative correlation between component and
   composite coefficients of variation (20). 8) points out that if
   coefficients of variation are similar on an arithmetic scale, then a
   log transformation or a scale change would eliminate scale‐related
   differences in variance. Thus a log transformation may stabilize the
   residual variation and strengthen the statistical relationship (8; 1),
   but it also provides a convenient test for scaling effects.

Results

Phenotype heritability distributions and differences in central tendency

   Central tendency of behavioural heritability in our data set
   (0.31 ± SE=0.013, median=0.23) was not significantly different
   (t[581]=0.37, P=n.s.: median test χ[1]^2=0.35, P=n.s.) from 32) and 26)
   data (x=0.30 ± 0.023, median=0.25), so we combined the data sets. The
   combined data set was positively skewed [mean=0.31 ± 95% confidence
   limits (CL)=0.02, median=0.23]. Eleven heritability estimates (1.9%)
   were larger than 1.0, six were smaller than 0 (1%) and the
   interquartile range was between 0.09 and 0.45 (Fig. 1).

   Frequency distributions for behavioural traits in the upper panel (a),
   life history traits in the middle panel (b), and morphological traits
   in the panel at the bottom (c). The inset in panel (a) indicates the
   proportions of domestic (dark bar) and wild (light bar) in each
   heritability interval. Behavioural heritability estimates that are
   either less than zero or greater than 1 are indicated by the light bars
   at the distribution extremes.

   Central tendency of the behavioural heritability distribution was
   similar to central tendency of the life history distribution (Fig. 1).
   A one‐way ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences
   (F[2,1527]=72.0, P < 0.0001) between average behavioural, life history
   and morphological heritabilities. A post hoc Tukey–Kramer HSD indicated
   average life history (0.26 ± 95% CL=0.024) and behavioural
   heritabilities differed significantly from average morphological
   heritability. But neither the Tukey test nor a median test
   (χ[1]^2=0.26, P=n.s.) indicated that the difference in central tendency
   between behavioural and life history heritabilities was significant.

Variation reported

   26) noted that standard errors (SE) are frequently not reported. 16)
   recommended routine reporting of CV[A] and CV[R], or at least the data
   required to estimate them. Between 1988 and 2000, 75% of the studies
   (59/79) have reported SEs or CLs associated with heritability
   estimates. But only 227 of the 428 (53%) estimates which we collected
   in addition to 26) and Roff and Mousseau's 154 estimates had associated
   SEs or CLs. Between 1993 and 2000, 29.4% studies (20/68) reported CVs
   or both the mean and variance of the traits analysed. However, we could
   obtain CV[A] for 22% of the estimates in these studies (67/304) and
   CV[R] for only 18% (54/304).

Relationships between CV[R], CV[A] and heritability

   Average CV[A] (22.83 ± SE=4.14) was smaller than the average CV[R]
   estimate (43.7 ± 7.37). The log[10]‐transformed variables were
   positively related (log CV[R]=0.73 + 0.63 log CV[A], r^2=0.49,
   P < 0.0001). Thus, although CV[R] is larger on average than CV[A], the
   slope indicates CV[R] does not generally increase disproportionally
   faster than CV[A].

   Both CV[A] and CV[R] affect heritability in the expected directions,
   although their coefficients were not very different in magnitude. The
   multiple regression with heritability as the dependent variable on
   log CV[A] and log CV[R] was highly significant (F[3,52]=94.8,
   P < 0.0001, R^2=0.85), although the interaction term was not
   significant (t=–0.58, d.f.=1, 52, P=0.56). We removed the interaction
   term and recalculated the regression, but neither the significance of
   the relationship nor the coefficient of determination changed. Both
   regression coefficients were highly significant, although CV[A] was
   positive (t=19.0, d.f.=1, 53, P < 0.0001, CV[A]=0.61) whereas CV[R] was
   negative (t=–17.9, d.f.=1, 53, P=0.0001, CV[R]=–0.64).

   A simple path analysis indicates that log CV[A] and log CV[R] do not
   have independent effects on heritability (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the
   direct effects of log CV[A] and log CV[R], indicated by the
   standardized partial regression coefficients (Fig. 2b), can be compared
   because they are on the same scale. First, their magnitudes are similar
   enough that they do not provide compelling evidence of a
   disproportionate effect of either log CV[A] or log CV[R]. Furthermore
   the correlation between log CV[A] and log CV[R] is highly significant
   and it has a critical statistical effect of reducing the variance
   explained by both log CV[A] and log CV[R], as both partials are larger
   than 1 (Fig. 2b). Only a causal model that includes the addition of an
   intercorrelated path between log CV[A] and log CV[R] (correlated
   effects model) is consistent with these observations (Fig. 2a). This
   result indicates that a disproportionate, independent effect of
   log CV[R] (or log CV[A]) on behavioural heritability is not a
   sufficient explanation of their causal relationships (21).

   Two path analytic, causal models relating CV[A], CV[R] and h^2
   (uncorrelated model above and intercorrelated effects model below). In
   the uncorrelated cause model above (a), the independent effects of
   CV[R]and CV[A] are assumed to govern variability in h^2 (21). In this
   case, the partial regression coefficients (p[hR], p[hA]) should equal
   their correlation coefficients (r[hA], r[hR]) and one or both of their
   squared values (coefficients of determination) should largely explain
   the nonresidual variance (r[hA]^2 + r[h][R]^2=1.0 – r^2[residual]). In
   the intercorrelated causes model (b), the common causes of h^2 are
   correlated (r[AR]), so the effects of CV[R] and CV[A] on heritability
   are through their direct effects measured by the standardized partial
   regression coefficients (p[hR], p[hA]) and their intercorrelated effect
   [i.e. r[hR]=p[hR] + p[hA] × r[AR]; variance explained=r^2[residual] +
   p[hR]^2 + p[hA]^2 + 2(p[hR] × r[AR] × p[hA])=1.0].

Cross‐classification of heritabilities

   All of the behavioural heritabilities were cross‐classified into
   categories related to selection or structure. Therefore we used a fully
   factorial ANOVA with heritability as the dependent variable to test for
   significant effects of differences in: (1) two estimation method
   categories, (2) wild/domestic categories, (3) three levels of
   integration and (4) seven behavioural ecology categories. With the full
   seven behavioural ecology categories, we could not estimate the three
   and four way interactions. However, heritabilities of the seven
   behaviour ecology categories did not differ significantly (one‐way
   ANOVA: F[6,574]=1.6, P=n.s.). Consequently, we collapsed the seven
   behavioural ecology categories into two metacategories: first,
   categories presumed to have consistent, directional fitness
   relationships (foraging, predator avoidance, reproduction); and second,
   categories more loosely related to fitness (social, temperament,
   movement and other). We repeated the analysis using the fully factorial
   model with the two metacategories. The four‐way interaction was not
   significant. The three‐way interaction between level of analysis,
   estimation method and wild/domestic categories was significant, in
   addition to the estimation method main effect. We removed the
   nonsignificant four‐way interaction and repeated the analysis, which
   produced the same result (three‐way interaction (level of
   analysis × estimation method × wild/domestic): F[2,554]=5.4, P < 0.01;
   estimation method: F[1,554]=12.4, P < 0.001). All the other effects had
   probability values greater than 0.16. To illustrate determinants of
   this three‐way interaction, we plotted average values governing the
   three, two‐way combinations (Figs 3 and 4).

   Average heritability of different estimation methods (with or without
   dominance in the denominator) in the upper diagram (a) and

   indicates heritability estimates that include dominance (square
   symbols), whereas the round symbols indicate estimates that do not
   include dominance. In diagram b, the square symbol indicates domestic
   categories and the round indicates wild categories. In both diagrams,
   average heritability of the different classes is estimated at three
   levels of integration (low, medium and high). The bars indicate 1 SE
   and sample sizes for each estimation method/wild‐domestic category are
   in brackets.

   Average heritability estimates of wild/domestic categories grouped by
   estimation method indicate dominance effects are larger in domestic
   (and semidomestic species) than in nondomestic (wild) species (Fig. 3).
   This observation is consistent with the idea that directional selection
   related to domestication reduces additive genetic variation. The
   distribution of wild and domestic species did not affect central
   tendency of h^2, for both categories had a similar distribution across
   the range of heritability values (Fig. 1 inset). The difference between
   estimation method categories in wild (nondomestic) species was not
   significant (t[295]=1.24, P=n.s.). 32) and 26) reported similar
   observations. Finally, our estimate of semidomestic average
   heritability that does not include dominance variance components (0.17)
   was significantly smaller than additive estimates for domestic and wild
   species (Fig. 3). But, the semidomestic estimate was similar to average
   heritabilities (0.18) reported by 32) and 14) for Drosophila behaviour.

   Average heritabilities of estimation method categories (Fig. 4a) or
   wild/domestic classes (Fig. 4b) did not differ significantly at the
   high integration level, but did at lower integration levels. In
   particular, dominance effects in the numerator significantly biased
   estimation methods upwards at low and medium levels of integration, but
   not at the high integration level (Fig. 4a). This did not appear to be
   because of different proportions of wild and domestic species
   (Fig. 4b). If selection is stronger on highly integrated traits, or
   residual variation is disproportionately high compared with additive
   variation in highly integrated characters, then there should be
   divergence in these category averages across integration levels. But,
   they converged (Fig. 4a). If these effects of selection and structure
   are stronger at higher integration levels, then we would also expect a
   decline in average heritabilities across integration level. Neither
   plot indicated there was a decrease in heritability at a higher
   integration level (Fig. 4a,b). In summary, neither the expected
   differences related to selection nor variance compounding was observed
   at the highest integration level, although the dominance‐related
   differences at lower integration levels indicates the effects of
   directional selection (22; 4).

Selection, structure and CV

   There was less data available for testing hypotheses involving CV[A]
   and CV[R], so we restricted out statistical analysis to a median test
   and one‐way Welch ANOVA analyses because of heterogeneous variances
   (6).

   We first compared CV[A] between wild and domestic species (no CVs were
   available for semidomestic species) and found differences between
   categories in both CV[A] and CV[R]. Assuming selection reduces additive
   genetic variation and selection is stronger in domestic species, CV[A]
   should be lower on average in the domestic category compared with the
   wild category. CV[A] of domestic species was lower (CV[A]:
   domestic=14.72 ± 4.9, n=30; wild=23.23 ± 2.5, n=40), and a median test
   indicated this difference was highly significant (χ[1]^2=14.720;
   P < 0.0001). A t‐test provided a marginal result (t[68]=2.777, P=0.10),
   unless one extreme outlier was removed (CV[A] domestic=10.34 ± 2.2:
   t[67]=3.69, P < 0.001). At the same time, average CV[R] of domestic
   species (30.8 ± 6.4, n=23) was also significantly lower (t[54]=–2.9,
   P < 0.01; median test, χ[1]^2=8.8, P < 0.01) than wild CV[R]
   (58.1 ± 6.4, n=33). In other words, the difference between CV[R] of
   domestic and wild species changes in the same direction as the CV[A],
   but in this case, lower residual variation characterizes traits which
   appear to be under stronger selection.

Behaviour ecology categories

   Differences in CV[A] and CV[R] among behavioural ecology categories
   were marginally significant (CV[A]; Welch ANOVAF[6,9.2]=6.5, P < 0.01;
   median test χ[6]^2=17.9; P < 0.01; CV[R]; Welch ANOVAF[6,7]=4.14,
   P < 0.05; median test χ[6]^2=15.31; P < 0.05). CV[A] and CV[R] of life
   history‐related traits (reproductive, foraging, antipredator) were
   higher than the grand average whereas CV[A] and CV[R] of the other
   traits (social, movement, temperament, other) were lower than the grand
   mean (Table 2). The slope of the regression of log[10] CV[R] on
   log[10] CV[A] across these seven categories was less than 1
   (log CV[R]=0.75 + 0.70 × log CV[A], r^2=0.71, P < 0.05, 95%
   CL=0.18–1.22), indicating CV[R] did not increase disproportionately.

   heritability, CV[A], and CV[R] estimates classified as behaviour

Integration level

   Both CV[A] and CV[R] increased from low to high integration level
   (Fig. 5). These results support 13) argument that structural
   differences classified by integration level are associated with
   differences in additive genetic variation and 31) suggestion that these
   sources of variation covary (CV[A]; Welch ANOVAF[2,34.9]=11.49,
   P < 0.0001; median test χ[1]^2=14.768; P < 0.001; CV[R]; Welch
   ANOVAF[2,21]=22.3, P < 0.0001; median test χ[1]^2=9.2; P < 0.01). In
   particular, the slope of their relationship suggests the increase in
   CV[R] is greater on average than CV[A] (log CV[R]=– 0.33 × 1.6 log CVA,
   r^2=0.99, P < 0.05, Fig. 5), consistent with variance compounding
   hypotheses.

   Regression of CV[R] on CV[A] across low, medium and high integration
   levels. The regression coefficient is significant, positive and greater
   than one (CV[R]=–18.9 × 4.01 CV[A], F[1,1]=1405.6, P=0.01, r^2=0.99;
   log CV[R]=–0.33 + 1.6 × CV[A], r^2=0.99, P=0.04) It is also the same as
   a geometric mean regression (30), which takes variation in both axes
   into account. The horizontal and vertical bars indicate 1 SE, and error
   bars may be smaller than the symbol.

Scale, means and variation

   Because of the small number of studies reporting CV[A], CV[R] and
   particularly means (x), we used a data set that included behavioural,
   life history and morphological character parameters (n=191) to test
   whether in general, a log transformation equilibrates residual
   variation of relationships between V[A] and character means. In
   addition, log‐transformed values of V[A] and x can be organized into a
   linear model, wherein the slope coefficient
   (log V[A]=intercept + coefficient × log x) tests whether additive
   genetic variance is proportional to the mean or its square. Character
   means V[R] and V[A] are positively and significantly related on both
   the arithmetic and log scale, however, in the log[10] transformed
   relationships, both residual and additive genetic variation have closer
   relationships with character averages (V[R]=–109.7 + 6.02 × x,
   r^2=0.34, F[1,186]=97.5, P < 0.0001; log V[R]=1.82 + 1.87 × log x,
   r^2=0.71, F[1,184]=451.3, P < 0.0001; V[A]=–634.8 + 16.99 × x,
   r^2=0.31, F[1,187]=84.19, P ≤ 0.0001; log V[A]=2.25 + 1.83 × log x,
   r^2=0.80, F[1,187]=693.9, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the slope
   coefficient on the log scale indicates both variance components are
   approximately proportional to the square of their mean.

   On an arithmetic scale, average CV[A] and CV[R] differed significantly
   between integration levels (CV[A]: Welch ANOVAF[2,35]=11.27, P < 0.001;
   CV[R]: F[2, 19.4]=22.6, P < 0.0001), indicating that differences
   between these categories are not entirely because of proportionality of
   their means and variances (8). CV[A] and CV[R] were positively
   correlated across behavioural ecology categories and integration
   levels. This suggests that neither measurement error (33) nor
   component/composite correlations (20) can account for differences
   within these categories.

Discussion

   There may not be a general expectation about the average relationship
   between behaviour and fitness (16), although behavioural ecologists
   often assume many foraging and reproductive behaviours are closely
   related to fitness. In general, this assumption appears justified, for
   average (or median) behavioural heritability is similar to average life
   history heritability. At the same time, this indicates mechanisms
   causing (low) heritabilities of behaviour pose much the same problem as
   low life history heritabilities (29; 16, 17; 31; 23). Low
   heritabilities could be caused by an erosion of additive genetic
   variation, by selection (elimination‐selection hypothesis) or, by a
   disproportionate increase in residual variation (disproportionate
   variance compounding hypothesis: 29; 16, 17; 24). Both hypotheses
   predict that each mechanism should lower heritability and each
   hypothesis assumes its effect on heritability is independent.
   Directional differences in both CV[A] and heritability indicated
   elimination‐selection had a detectable effect on heritability, but
   there was also a disproportionate increase in CV[R] with integration
   level. However, heritability did not differ between behavioural
   categories thought to be more or less closely related to fitness, nor
   was it low at the highest integration level. These results suggest that
   the nature of a behavioural character predisposes it to differences in
   elimination selection and its structure governs how it integrates
   variation, but selection, structure and their interaction appear to
   determine variation in heritability.

Evidence of selection

   Relatively high dominance variation suggests directional selection on
   behaviour may be common in domestic and semidomestic environments, but
   not in wild populations. We can estimate the relative contributions of
   dominance and additive variance using dominance variance standardized
   by the sum of dominance and additive variance D[α]
   [D[α]=V[d]/(V[d] + V[a]), 4]. Our estimates for semidomestic (0.58) and
   domestic (0.55) species were both not significantly different from the
   life history estimate reported by 4). This suggests behavioural traits
   in these categories are under directional selection that is as strong
   as selection on life history traits. At the same time, our estimate of
   D[α] for behaviour of wild populations (0.23) is much smaller, although
   it is not significantly different from 4) estimate for the same
   category. The relatively low proportion of dominance variance in wild
   or nondomestic populations means that heritability estimates are not
   significantly biased by the estimation method. In other words, full sib
   breeding designs could be used for estimating additive genetic
   variation of wild population behaviour. Dominance variance of domestic
   and semidomestic populations was high and CV[A] of both categories was
   smaller than wild species. Finally, there was a concomitant difference
   in CV[R], which in this case is not related to variance compounding
   effects of structure (e.g. 16, 17; 27; 18; 19; 24). These results
   indicate that additive genetic variation of behavioural characters of
   animals under domestication is generally being eroded by directional
   selection and that there may be related changes in residual variation.

Variance compounding effects of structure

   Both low CV[A] and low heritabilities of behaviour in semidomestic
   species suggest that elimination‐selection may regulate (in part)
   behavioural heritabilities by reducing the size of additive genetic
   variation in the numerator. At the same time, low heritabilities have
   generally been explained by their large residual variance measured by
   CV[R] (= CV[P] – CV[A]) in the denominator (16; 27; 24; but see 19).
   24) point out that if large residual variation governs low heritability
   estimates, then the difference in residual variation between life
   history and morphological traits should be disproportionately larger
   than the corresponding difference in additive genetic variation. They
   report a disproportionate increase in CV[R] in an extensive data set on
   the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). They also note that
   CV[A]and CV[R] are positively and strongly correlated in both males and
   females, but argue this covariation does not influence the
   disproportionate increase in CV[R]. In other words, they hypothesize
   that CV[R] and CV[A] are independent causes of variation in
   heritability. We used their published results to construct a causal
   analysis of relationships between these three variables (CV[A], CV[R],
   h^2). First we note that their partial regression coefficient of CV[R]
   on h^2 is larger than one. On one hand, this result is consistent with
   their argument of a disproportionately strong effect of residual
   phenotypic variation on heritability. But, on the other hand, this
   result is inconsistent with an independent effects model (Fig. 2),
   because there must be an intercorrelated (complementary variable) which
   diminishes the variance of h^2, to at least the complement of the
   unexplained error variation (21). Second, we found that intercorrelated
   or indirect effects of both CV[A] and CV[R] had to be included in their
   causal analysis, similar to our analysis of relationships between CV[A]
   and CV[R] and behavioural heritability (Fig. ). But, what is the nature
   of these intercorrelated effects?

   Our results indicate a distinction should be made between the effects
   of selection or structure on phenotypic variance components and
   mechanisms governing relationships between them. The evidence for
   effects of selection was discussed above. CV[R] of behavioural trait
   categories was larger than corresponding CV[A] regardless of how they
   were classified, similar to studies cited above on morphology, life
   history and sexually selected characters. At the same time, both CV[A]
   and CV[R] increased across these categories. We proposed that if the
   slope of the relationship of log CV[R] on log CV[A] is greater than
   one, then there is evidence for a disproportionate increase in CV[R].
   CV[R] does increase disproportionately faster than CV[A] across
   different integration levels, indicating the importance of structure.
   This observation also suggests 29) model should apply to variation
   between behavioural categories, in addition to differences between life
   history and morpholological phenotypes (24). But, we did not see
   different heritabilities in behavioural ecology categories that had
   significantly different CV[A] and CV[R] (Table 2), nor was lower
   heritability observed at the highest integration level (Fig. 5). In
   addition, both the path analysis and the interactions between factors
   related to selection and structure indicate the intuitive relationship
   between h^2, CV[R] and CV[A] was not solely governed by direct effects
   of selection or structure as assumed in independent effects models. We
   suggest the intercorrelated effect, which appears to have its strongest
   influence at the highest integration level, is related to the influence
   of mechanisms causing phenotypic plasticity. However, different
   measurement scales, transformations, mathematical constraints, scaling
   of errors, arbitrary categories, or sampling effects are thought to
   cause or confound the interpretation of similar relationships.

Scale effects

   Our estimates of behavioural heritabilities in domestic, semidomestic
   and wild (nondomestic) species are very similar to those reported in
   other, independently organized studies. Furthermore, the magnitude of
   variation in CV[A] and CV[R] across behavioural ecology classes
   (Table 1) or integration levels (Fig. 5) is similar to variation
   reported across life history and morphology categories (e.g. 16; 19;
   24). At the same time, scaling effects strictly due to various
   phenotypic measurement scales (29), must be less of a problem within a
   phenotype category (i.e. behaviour). Heritabilities are scale invariant
   (1). But, 31) suggests comparisons of CV[A] and CV[R] may involve
   differences related to a scale transformation between these variance
   components. Thus, one problem is determining a scale where means and
   variances of CV[A] and CV[R] have similar, proportional relationships.
   We found log‐transformed means and variances had similar relationships
   in both coefficients (CV[A] and CV[R]). In addition, the
   log‐transformed relationships between CV[A] and CV[R] were positive,
   indicating on one hand that their relationship across behavioural
   ecology categories was not caused by measurement errors (33) and on the
   other that part – whole correlations (20) cannot explain the
   relationship across integration levels. It could also be argued that
   our categories are arbitrary with respect to fitness or structure. This
   cannot be discounted in principal, and within each category we
   acknowledge the problems with assigning behavioural characters to
   ordinal categories. However, we observed that CV[R] was higher than
   CV[A] in each category class and we found differences in CV[A] between
   behavioural ecology classes which are commonly thought to differ in
   both their structure and their relationship with fitness (13). Similar
   results have been reported in studies on differences between morphology
   and life history (16; 19; 24). At the same time, the sample population
   of studies reporting coefficients of variation is small relative to the
   heritability sample population. To this we can only reinforce 16)
   appeal that these statistics be routinely reported.

Selection, structure and genotype by environment interactions

   How does the nature of a behavioural trait determine it's heritability?
   Behavioural character heritabilities differ with respect to effects of
   selection, for which we found more evidence in characters considered to
   be less closely related to fitness and less affected by variance
   compounding. Similar to 27) study which showed that sexually selected
   morphological traits had a different structure than other morphological
   traits, behavioural character categories that differ in structure have
   different CV[A] and CV[R]. Life history traits such as fecundity
   genetically integrate (3) both morphological and physiological
   characters within a single life stage (e.g. 34). This is also the case
   for complex behavioural characters (13). On one hand, both CV[A] and
   heritability are standardized measures of additive genetic variation
   (16), but on the other hand, nonsignificant correlations between CV[A]
   and heritability suggest they are not surrogate measures of genetic
   variation (16; 27). Furthermore, CV[R] is typically larger than CV[A]
   (23), implying that compounded environmental variation governs
   differences in heritability (2; 29). However, our study shows that
   CV[A]and heritability are positively related in behavioural characters,
   and disproportionate variance compounding does not generally explain
   variation in behavioural heritabilities. Our analysis points to the
   importance of relationships between additive genetic and nonadditive
   genetic residual variation. Although additive genetic variation is a
   distinct variance component, residual variation comprises dominance,
   genotype by environment interactions, epistatic and other nonadditive
   genetic variation, in addition to environmental variation. 23) point
   out that dominance variance is an important variance component in
   selection studies and that the magnitude of this component would
   negatively covary with additive genetic variation. But, this does not
   explain our observation that average heritability of category classes
   with different dominance variation converged at the highest integration
   level and that CV[A] and CV[R] are positively related. Alternatively,
   highly integrated behaviours such as foraging, mate choice and predator
   avoidance are characterized by conditional strategies or phenotypically
   plastic responses to environmental cues. Genetic variation for
   phenotypic plasticity may be because of both additive genetic variance
   and genotype by environment interaction variance. In this light,
   heritability may be viewed not as a misleading standardized index of
   additive genetic variation, but as a statistic which integrates effects
   of selection, structure and the interrelationships between variance
   components, all of which may contribute to the genetic architecture of
   different quantitative characters.

Abstract

   Gallbladder cancer is a common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract
   that shows wide geographical variation in its distribution. Cause of
   gallbladder cancer is still obscure; however, various etiological
   factors have been proposed. Of these gallstones and inflammation of the
   gallbladder is commonest. Despite three decades of active research no
   conclusive evidence is available as to what causes gallbladder cancer?
   In this article we reviewed the evidence on the role of environmental
   pollutants on gallbladder carcinogenesis. A detailed search of Medline
   was carried out which revealed only 12 articles. A number of heavy
   metals like nickel, cadmium, etc. have been implicated; however, the
   evidence is not robust enough to conclude its association. Role of
   radiation and pesticides in river water have also been evaluated
   without any conclusive evidence of its association with gallbladder
   cancer. Better designed case‐control studies or cohort studies looking
   at exposure are required before it could be accepted as one of the
   causes of GBC. J. Surg. Oncol. 2006;93:640–643. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Abstract

   To evaluate prospectively the association between serological markers
   of selected infections, including HPV, and risk of developing cervical
   cancer (CC) and precancer, we performed a nested case–control study
   within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
   (EPIC) study that included 184 cases of invasive CC (ICC), 425 cases of
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or carcinoma in situ
   (CIS), and 1,218 matched control women. At enrollment participants
   completed lifestyle questionnaires and provided sera. Subjects were
   followed‐up for a median of 9 years. Immunoassays were used to detect
   serum antibodies to Human Herpes Virus 2 (HHV‐2), Chlamydia trachomatis
   (CT), Chlamydia pneumoniae, L1 proteins of mucosal and cutaneous HPV
   types, E6/E7 proteins of HPV16/18, as well as to four polyomaviruses.
   Adjusted odds ratios (OR) [and 95% confidence intervals (CI)] for
   CIN3/CIS and ICC risk were respectively: 1.6 (1.2–2.0) and 1.8
   (1.1–2.7) for L1 seropositivity to any mucosal HPV type, 1.0 (0.4–2.4)
   and 7.4 (2.8–19.7) for E6 seropositivity to HPV16/18, 1.3 (0.9–1.9) and
   2.3 (1.3–4.1) for CT seropositivity, and 1.4 (1.0–2.0) and 1.5
   (0.9–2.6) for HHV‐2 seropositivity. The highest OR for ICC was observed
   for HPV16 E6 seropositivity [OR = 10.2 (3.3–31.1)]. Increasing number
   of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was associated with
   increasing risk. Non‐STIs were not associated with CC risk. In
   conclusion, this large prospective study confirms the important role of
   HPV and a possible contribution of CT and HHV‐2 in cervical
   carcinogenesis. It further identifies HPV16 E6 seropositivity as the
   strongest marker to predict ICC well before disease development.

Abstract

Aim

   To assess the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing
   biodiversity decline. We first test whether species richness of
   butterfly assemblages is higher within European Natura 2000 (N2000)
   sites than in their surroundings. We then assess temporal trends in
   butterfly richness and test whether these trends differ inside and
   outside the N2000 network.

Location

   Germany, Europe.

Methods

   We utilized generalized linear mixed‐effects models (GLMM) to analyse
   an 11‐year data series on species richness of butterfly assemblages
   collected on 245 transects across Germany, located inside and outside
   N2000 sites, and comprising a total of 122 butterfly species.

Results

   Butterfly species richness was highest inside N2000 protected areas,
   while outside it constantly declined with increasing distance from
   N2000 sites. We found an overall decline in species richness by 10%
   within 11 years. This decline neither differed between transects
   located inside or outside the N2000 network nor varied with distance
   from N2000 sites.

Main conclusions

   The higher species richness inside the N2000 network underlines their
   proper designation and their potential for the conservation of
   biodiversity. However, the current negative trend in butterfly species
   richness across Germany is not mitigated by the N2000 network, and we
   assume insufficient management or measures targeted at other organisms
   than butterflies as potential reasons.

1 INTRODUCTION

   In spite of nationally and internationally set goals and introduced
   policies, we are currently experiencing an undiminished decline of
   biodiversity (Brooks et al., 2012; Butchart et al., 2010; Eskildsen
   et al., 2015; Tittensor et al., 2014). In Europe, the cornerstone of
   species protection policy is the Natura 2000 (N2000) network of
   protected areas (EC, 2010). The N2000 network is one of the most
   important and largest conservation networks of the world (Hochkirch
   et al., 2013; Lockwood, 2006), currently covering over 18% of the EU′s
   land surface (EC, 2015a). It has been based on two basic directives—the
   “Birds Directive” targeted on the conservation of birds (EEC, 1979) and
   the “Habitats Directive” focussing on selected threatened species and
   habitats (EEC, 1992).

   Several studies already investigated the effectiveness of designation,
   that is, how well the N2000 network covers the distribution of
   threatened species or the diversity of certain taxonomic groups (e.g.,
   D'Amen et al., 2013; Guareschi, Bilton, Velasco, Millán, & Abellán,
   2015; Maiorano et al., 2015; Trochet & Schmeller, 2013; Van der Sluis
   et al., 2016; Verovnik, Govedič, & Šalamun, 2011). These studies
   conclude that, with a few exceptions, the coverage of biodiversity is
   largely satisfactory.

   In addition to the successful designation of areas of high
   biodiversity, an even more critical measure of success would be the
   ability of protected areas to diminish, halt or even reverse the
   currently observed negative trends in biodiversity. Published trends of
   target and non‐target species (usually mammals and birds) in protected
   areas across the world tend to be rather positive (Barnes et al., 2016;
   Geldmann et al., 2013; Laurance et al., 2012), but have rarely been
   compared with populations outside protected areas.

   Studies assessing trends in species richness or abundance to evaluate
   the efficiency of the European N2000 network over time are scarce, and
   all of them focus on birds. These studies found predominantly positive
   trends of species protected under the Birds Directive, in particular
   flagship and specialized species, which seems to indicate an overall
   success of EU legislation (Donald et al., 2007; Sanderson et al.,
   2016), while for common and non‐target species, the pattern appears to
   be ambiguous (Devictor, Godet, Julliard, Couvet, & Jiguet, 2007;
   Pellissier, Touroult, Julliard, Siblet, & Jiguet, 2013; Santana et al.,
   2014). Given the low number of studies and their limitation to a few
   taxonomic groups, a general assessment of the extent to which the N2000
   network can reduce negative trends is currently hardly possible.

   Here, we assess the effectiveness of N2000 sites in preventing the
   decline of biodiversity using butterflies as an example for a
   non‐target species group. Butterflies are a popular group of insects
   which is appreciated by the public for their aesthetic, symbolic and
   intrinsic value (Potts et al., 2016). Moreover, as primary consumers,
   pollinators and prey they fulfil important roles in ecosystem
   functioning and are often used as indicators for the assessment of the
   state of ecosystems (Erhardt & Thomas, 1991; Van Swaay, Warren, & Loïs,
   2006; Zografou, Sfenthourakis, Pullin, & Kati, 2009). They are
   frequently an object of research and probably the most surveyed group
   of insects, at least in Europe (Van Swaay, Nowicki, Settele, & Van
   Strien, 2008; Van Swaay et al., 2006). These qualities predestine
   butterflies to be a convenient surrogate for less conspicuous taxa
   (Thomas et al., 2004). Butterflies can act as flagship and umbrella
   species and thus contribute to the conservation of habitats and other
   organisms (Maes & Van Dyck, 2005; Simberloff, 1998; Spitzer, Beneš,
   Dandová, Jašková, & Konvička, 2009). In our study, we used time series
   data on species richness of butterflies across Germany to address two
   particular aims: (a) To test whether butterfly species richness is
   higher in N2000 areas compared to their surroundings and (b) to assess
   overall temporal trends in species richness of butterfly assemblages
   and whether these trends differ inside and outside the N2000 network.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study sites and butterfly data

   We used data from the German Butterfly Monitoring Scheme
   (www.tagfalter-monitoring.de). Here, monitoring has been conducted by
   volunteers since 2005 according to a standardized protocol (see Kühn
   et al., 2008 for details). Data quality is checked by experts, and the
   data are centrally managed. The number of transects has been growing
   over time; therefore, there are 11‐year data series for the oldest
   transects and shorter series for the others, covering 5–11 years.
   Transect data at different time spans (i.e., number of years of
   observation) were evenly distributed, resulting in about 40 transect
   data per time span. Transects also differed in length, but each
   transect consists of several sections with a standard length of 50 m.
   For our analysis, we selected transects with 5–20 sections, resulting
   in 245 transects distributed all across Germany (Supporting Information
   Figure S1). We excluded data points with less than two species per year
   and transect leading to 1993 transect‐year combinations for our
   analysis.

   We used a map of N2000 sites obtained from the European Environmental
   Agency (EEA, 2011) to identify the position of the transects with the
   GIS software SAGA 2.1.4 in two ways. Transects overlaying at least
   partly with N2000 sites were considered as “inside.” About 28% of the
   considered transects were inside N2000 areas, which is larger than the
   overall coverage of N2000 areas in Germany (15.5%; EC, 2015a). We also
   measured the distance of individual transects (centre points) from the
   boundary of the closest N2000 site using the function near, implemented
   in the software ArcGis 10.2.

   We included occurrence data of 122 species of true butterflies
   (families Nymphalidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, Riodinidae, Papilionidae)
   and skippers (family Hesperiidae). Hardly distinguishable species were
   treated as complexes resulting in a final list of 115 items (Supporting
   Information Table S1).

   To account for potential differences in habitat suitability among
   transects within and outside N2000 areas, we computed a “habitat
   suitability index” (hsi) for each transect, which basically weights the
   amount of a particular habitat type by the number of species that are
   associated with this habitat type. In particular, we used habitat data
   from the Map of European ecosystem types (European Environment Agency,
   http://biodiversity.europa.eu/maes) classified according to EUNIS
   habitat classification level 2 (EEA, 2014) and calculated the
   percentage of each habitat type within a 1 km radius around each
   transect centre point. To assess habitat associations, we extracted the
   number of butterfly species associated with each habitat type from
   Reinhardt, Sbieschne, Settele, Fischer, and Fiedler (2007). Finally,
   the percentage of a habitat type occurring within the buffer zone of a
   particular transect was multiplied by the number of its associated
   butterfly species and the hsi was calculated as the sum of all habitat
   specific values in the buffer zone.

2.2 Data analysis

   All statistical analyses were performed using the software r 3.3.2 (R
   Core Team, 2016). We computed species richness (as number of species)
   for each sampling year within each transect. To test for the effect of
   N2000 sites on species richness of butterfly assemblages, their overall
   temporal trends and hypothesized differences in trends between N2000
   sites and their surroundings, we constructed generalized linear
   mixed‐effects models (GLMM) with a Poisson distribution and log link
   function, using the R package lme4 version 1.1‐12 (Bates, Maechler,
   Bolker, & Walker, 2014). We used the location of transects (inside or
   outside) or, alternatively, the distance of transects from the nearest
   N2000 area to test for differences in species richness within and
   outside N2000 areas. We included year (scaled to mean zero and unit
   standard deviation) as a further explanatory variable to assess overall
   temporal trends in species richness and the interaction of year and
   location (inside or outside) or distance to test for differences in
   trends. The relevance of this interaction was assessed according to
   resulting p‐values. We also included transect length as a covariable to
   account for potential sampling effects. To account for potential
   problems of pseudoreplication, we included transect as a random effect
   allowing for random intercepts and random slopes of year. To control
   for potentially confounding effects of general differences in overall
   habitat suitability inside and outside N2000 areas, we alternatively
   computed models including hsi (scaled to mean zero and unit standard
   deviation) as an additional variable which lead to four models in total
   (Supporting Information Table S2). All models were checked for spatial
   autocorrelation in the residuals by computing overall Moran's I using
   the R package ncf version 1.1‐7 (Bjornstad, 2013), but no spatial
   autocorrelation was found. We used the R package effects version 4.0‐0
   (Fox, 2003) for visualizing the results.

3 RESULTS

   According to our expectations, butterfly species richness was higher
   within N2000 sites than outside (Figure 1a; Supporting Information
   Table S2) and it constantly decreased with growing distance from the
   N2000 sites (Figure 1b, Supporting Information Table S2). Models using
   location (inside or outside N2000) or distance were both statistically
   significant, but according to AIC values, the distance from N2000
   appeared to be a better predictor of butterfly diversity than the
   location (delta AIC > 2; Supporting Information Table S2). The effect
   of distance may be attributed to habitat availability in the
   surroundings of N2000 sites. However, the effect of hsi on species
   richness was not statistically significant (p = 0.11 and 0.13,
   respectively), while the effect of location and distance remained
   significant (models M3 and M4 in Supporting Information Table S2). The
   hsi in buffer zones around transects did not differ significantly
   within or outside N2000 areas (Welch two‐sample t test: t = 1.88,
   df = 100.1, p = 0.063) but decreased with growing distance from N2000
   sites (linear regression: coefficient = −0.57, SE = 0.29, t = 1.97,
   p = 0.050).

   bars and grey bands indicate 95% confidence intervals; ticks on the

   We also found that butterfly species richness declined over the
   11 years of observation (Figure 2, Supporting Information Table S2).
   The overall mean decline was 10%—from an average of 19.5 to 17.5
   species per transect. However, we did not find an interaction effect
   between N2000 sites and year (neither for location nor for distance) in
   any of the four models (M1: p = 0.35, M2: p = 0.93, M3: p = 0.47, M4:
   p = 0.91), indicating that the negative trends in species richness did
   not differ between N2000 sites and their surroundings (Figure 3).

4 DISCUSSION

   We found that N2000 areas harboured more butterfly species than their
   surroundings as expected. This result suggests a proper designation of
   the N2000 network and that these sites are of overall high conservation
   importance. Several previous studies at the European scale on mammals
   and birds also showed that the majority of species (both target and
   non‐target) seems to be well covered by the current extent of the N2000
   network (Maiorano et al., 2015; Trochet & Schmeller, 2013; Van der
   Sluis et al., 2016), but see Albuquerque, Assunção‐Albuquerque,
   Cayuelac, Zamoraa, and Benitoa (2013). For insects and other
   invertebrates, only regional assessments have been performed and their
   results are equivocal (D'Amen et al., 2013; Guareschi et al., 2015;
   Hernandez‐Manrique, Numa, Verdu, Galante, & Lobo, 2012). The only
   detailed study on butterflies showed that hotspots of species richness
   in Slovenia are well covered by the N2000 network (Verovnik et al.,
   2011).

   We also found that the distance from N2000 sites is a better predictor
   of butterfly richness than a simpler inside–outside approach. We
   propose two not mutually exclusive explanations for this phenomenon.
   The first is related to a gradual decrease in the availability of
   suitable butterfly habitats with increasing distance from N2000 sites.
   N2000 sites often represent the most diverse or particularly important
   parts within an overall valuable landscape (e.g., Verovnik et al.,
   2011). In such landscapes, butterfly species are likely to thrive
   accordingly well also outside the protected areas. Indeed, the amount
   of suitable habitat tended to decrease with growing distance from
   protected areas, indicating that such gradual changes in landscape
   structure can at least partly explain the distance effect. However,
   even when the amount of suitable habitat was considered in the models,
   a pure distance effect remained. One reason might be that not only
   habitat availability decreased with distance from N2000 sites but also
   the quality, for example, in terms of resource availability or
   management intensity (Kleijn & Van Langevelde, 2006).

   A second likely explanation of the observed distance effect relates to
   source‐sink dynamics (Furrer & Pasinelli, 2016; Pulliam, 1988) in a
   metapopulation context (Hanski, 1998). According to this concept,
   species may persist under less favourable conditions outside the N2000
   areas, because they may constantly immigrate from N2000 sites where the
   environmental conditions allow high population growth rates (Furrer &
   Pasinelli, 2016; Hanski, 1998). The observed distance effect is then
   defined by the dispersal ability (Furrer & Pasinelli, 2016) of the
   species within a particular assemblage. Given such a potential source
   effect of N2000 sites, our results not only confirm the importance of
   N2000 sites for protecting biodiversity within the network but also
   highlight their beneficial effects in their surroundings. However, this
   cannot be an excuse for bad management outside the N2000 network, since
   in the same way as protected areas are positively influencing their
   surroundings, detrimental forces in the surroundings can also
   negatively influence protected areas (Laurance et al., 2012).

   Most worryingly, we found an overall decline in butterfly species
   richness at German monitoring sites of 10% between 2005 and 2015.
   Although our study covered only Germany, our results suggest that
   similar processes of local species extinctions may occur in other
   European regions. Indeed, Maes and Van Dyck (2001) showed a strong
   decrease in the number of butterfly species in northern Belgium during
   the 20th century. A similar pattern was found in Denmark, where the
   most severe declines occurred between 1960 and 1979 and moderate
   declines continued in subsequent periods such as between 2000 and 2012
   (Eskildsen et al., 2015). Local species extinctions are often preceded
   by a decline in population abundance or density, which corresponds well
   to the decreasing abundances in butterfly populations as it has been
   shown, for example, by the European grassland butterfly indicator (Van
   Swaay et al., 2008, 2015). Another recent study showed a more than 75%
   decline in flying insect biomass in German protected areas (Hallmann
   et al., 2017). Potential causes of such declines are habitat loss
   (Sang, Teder, Helm, & Pärtel, 2010), fragmentation (Hanski, 2015;
   Krauss et al., 2010), habitat degradation (Stefanescu, Peñuelas, &
   Filella, 2009) or climate change (Oliver et al., 2015; Schweiger,
   Settele, Kudrna, Klotz, & Kühn, 2008; Settele, Bishop, & Potts, 2016;
   Settele et al., 2008).

   Despite generally higher butterfly species richness within N2000
   protected areas, their designation has obviously not prevented a loss
   of species over time. This result leads to the question whether current
   management of N2000 areas is generally suited to prevent such losses.
   Many butterfly species in Europe depend on habitats that require active
   management (grazing, mowing, coppicing etc.; see Van Swaay et al.,
   2012) to preserve them in a favourable state. This is especially true
   for European grasslands (Rundlöf, Bengtsson, & Smith, 2008; Van Swaay
   et al., 2012, 2015), the major habitat type of European butterflies.
   According to the last assessment of the state of nature in the European
   Union, grasslands are generally in an unfavourable conservation status
   across Europe (EC, 2015b). This situation holds true also for Germany,
   although there was a slight improvement since the previous assessment
   (EC, 2014). In Germany, comprehensive management plans have been
   adopted for only 20% of the entire network area (EC, 2014). Such a lack
   of management can lead to degradation and overgrowing, particularly of
   grasslands, by highly competitive vegetation of later successional
   stages (Collins & Beaufoy, 2012; Lindenmayer et al., 2007; Spitzer
   et al., 2009) and thus potentially contribute to the observed declines
   in butterfly richness. However, even if management plans are
   implemented, they might be inadequate for butterflies, for example,
   when agricultural intensity is too high (Konvička et al., 2008) or when
   management is targeted towards other organisms (Lindenmayer et al.,
   2007), or the time span since implementation was too short for being
   effective (Woodcock et al., 2012).

   We conclude that there is a notable decline in species richness of
   butterflies across Germany but the N2000 protected areas do currently
   not qualify as an effective mitigation measure. We argue that one of
   the main causes is the absence or insufficient implementation of
   management. We believe that negative biodiversity trends could be
   mitigated by fully implementing the European Habitats Directive which
   has not been done so far (Maes et al., 2013). This includes
   improvements in management, the allocation of funds towards targeted
   biodiversity support and enhanced monitoring (Collins & Beaufoy, 2012;
   Hochkirch et al., 2013; Hodge, Hauck, & Bonn, 2015; Potts et al.,
   2016). Furthermore, future management concepts need to consider a wider
   biodiversity context and should also take into account the mitigation
   of other potential drivers such as climate change. With respect to
   butterflies (and many other organisms as well), this means, for
   example, a stronger consideration of the landscape context in
   conservation planning and management for heterogeneity of habitats
   across space and time (Dennis, 2010; Papanikolaou, Kühn, Frenzel, &
   Schweiger, 2017; Van Swaay et al., 2012).

Summary

   Background music has been claimed to enhance people's creativity. In
   three experiments, we investigated the impact of background music on
   performance of Compound Remote Associate Tasks (CRATs), which are
   widely thought to tap creativity. Background music with foreign
   (unfamiliar) lyrics (Experiment 1), instrumental music without lyrics
   (Experiment 2), and music with familiar lyrics (Experiment 3) all
   significantly impaired CRAT performance in comparison with quiet
   background conditions. Furthermore, Experiment 3 demonstrated that
   background music impaired CRAT performance regardless of whether the
   music induced a positive mood or whether participants typically studied
   in the presence of music. The findings challenge the view that
   background music enhances creativity and are discussed in terms of an
   auditory distraction account (interference‐by‐process) and the
   processing disfluency account.

   Creativity is a vital aspect of cognition underpinning activities such
   as innovative product design, scientific advancement, and effective
   advertising and marketing communications. Background music is an
   environmental stimulus known to influence cognitive performance, which
   has also been claimed to enhance people's creativity for tasks
   involving spatial abilities such as drawing (see Schellenberg, Nakata,
   Hunter, & Tamoto, 2007). We argue, however, that there is limited
   empirical support for the claimed benefits of background music on
   creativity, with to our knowledge only one other study (i.e., Ritter &
   Ferguson, 2017) demonstrating a facilitatory effect on creativity of
   background music that participants were free to attend to for a task
   that involved participants listing novel, alternative uses for a common
   object (i.e., a brick). Another reason to be cautious regarding the
   notion that background music can enhance performance on tasks tapping
   creative cognition is the presence of a substantial research base
   demonstrating that to‐be‐ignored background sound impairs task
   performance (Beaman, 2005; Hughes & Jones, 2003).

   In the present paper, we critically examine the claim that background
   music enhances creativity by employing variants of widely used verbal
   problem solving tasks that are typically used to study creativity
   (Ansburg, 2000; Fodor, 1999; Mednick & Mednick, 1967; Mehta, Zhu, &
   Cheema, 2012; Mikulincer & Sheffi, 2000; Storm, Angello, & Bjork, 2011)
   being indexed by, and solved via, a process of insight: Compound Remote
   Associate Tasks (CRATs; e.g., see Bowden, Jung‐Beeman, Fleck, &
   Kounios, 2005; see below for further explanation). We contrast two
   competing accounts of the impact of background music on creative
   problem solving: (a) the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al.,
   2012), in which background music potentially enhances creativity by
   engendering processing disfluency and thence increased task engagement;
   and (b) the auditory distraction (interference‐by‐process) account
   (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000; Marsh, Hughes, & Jones, 2009; Perham &
   Vizard, 2010), which assumes that the presence of any type of auditory
   distractor sequence will disrupt cognitive task performance providing
   it demonstrates changing‐state characteristics. That is, auditory
   sequences in which a series of elements differ from one element to the
   next (such as tones, syllables, and words) in terms of
   frequency/pitch/timbre are more disruptive than a series within which
   the same element is repeated such as the same tone, syllable, or word.
   It has been shown, for example, that the latter, steady‐state stimuli
   typically fail to disrupt short‐term memory performance (e.g., Jones &
   Macken, 1993). It is worth noting here that in addition to this
   “acoustic interference‐by‐process,” an interference‐by‐process can also
   operate at a semantic level due to a clash between two concurrent
   semantic processes: a deliberate one applied to the to‐be‐remembered
   material and one applied automatically to the to‐be‐ignored auditory
   material (Marsh et al., 2009; Marsh, Hughes, & Jones, 2008). The focus
   of the current paper, however, is on the acoustic
   interference‐by‐process (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000).

   Prior to considering the relationship between background music and
   creative problem solving performance, it is useful to note that
   researchers have traditionally made a key distinction between two types
   of creative thinking, that is, divergent thinking versus convergent
   thinking (Guilford, 1967). Divergent thinking refers to a strategy
   whereby multiple creative ideas are produced and appraised within a
   short period of time in order to generate potential solutions for a
   given problem. A typical task involving divergent thinking is the
   Alternative Uses Task, wherein participants are required to think of as
   many uses as possible for a simple, everyday object such as a brick or
   paperclip (cf. the aforementioned study of music and creativity by
   Ritter & Ferguson, 2017). Convergent thinking, on the other hand,
   permits the connection of different ideas to determine a single,
   correct solution to a problem. Importantly, tasks involving creative
   convergent thinking—including the CRATs that we employed in the present
   study, as discussed below—may do so on the basis of associations and
   potential solutions generated through divergent thought.

   It is additionally important to note that creative problem solving,
   whether underpinned by divergent or convergent thinking, is often
   characterised by the ability to perceive a problem space in new ways by
   discovering hidden patterns or by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas
   (e.g., Ohlsson, 2011). One key way in which creative problem solving
   comes about is by means of so‐called insight, with tasks involving
   creative thinking typically being solved via insight processes.
   Accounts of insight in problem solving such as the “special‐process
   theory” (e.g., Ball & Stevens, 2009; Bowden et al., 2005) argue that
   problems that tend to be solved via an insight process call upon very
   different processing mechanisms to “noninsight” problems. For example,
   Jung‐Beeman et al. (2004) identified neural patterns just prior to the
   emergence of insight that demonstrate a hemispheric shift in processing
   occurring at this point. Jung‐Beeman et al. (2004) propose that during
   insight problem solving loose associative processing occurring
   nonconsciously in the right temporal lobe takes precedence over
   finer‐grained processing in the left hemisphere, implying that neural
   areas linked with diffuse associative processing are critical for the
   emergence of creative insight (for a recent review of related findings,
   see Shen, Yuan, Liu, & Luo, 2017).

   Several researchers suppose that an insight sequence defines creative
   thinking and that any advance in thought that is not characterised by
   such a sequence is therefore not creative (e.g., Ohlsson, 2011;
   Perkins, 2000; Wiley & Jarosz, 2012; but see Weisberg, 2015). This
   unique sequence of events that defines insight in problem solving
   comprises: presentation of the problem, repeated failure, impasse,
   restructuring, and an “Aha!” experience that is associated with
   solution generation. According to this sequence of events, failed
   attempts to solve a problem can lead to an impasse, whereby the
   participant, after several unsuccessful attempts at solving the
   problem, feels they are unable to move forward to reach a solution.
   After a period of failing to make progress, an abandoning of the
   original problem structure occurs and a new representation of the
   problem is formed through restructuring, which may itself be based on
   processes such as spreading activation in associative networks (see
   Shen et al., 2017). Such problem restructuring may then lead to the
   emergence of a solution. Crucially, problems that are typically solved
   by insight often cannot readily be solved via routine search processes.
   This is because the starting conditions, goals, and possible sequences
   of actions are ambiguous (i.e., a heuristic‐type search within the
   original problem representation will not yield a solution).

   As we have noted, our present research used CRATs as a measure of
   insight‐based creative problem solving (Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 1998). A
   CRAT involves a participant being shown three words (e.g., dress, dial,
   and flower), with the requirement being to find a single associated
   word (in this case “sun”) that can be combined with each presented word
   (either being placed before it or after it) to make a common word or
   phrase (i.e., sundress, sundial, and sunflower in the present example).
   CRATs are variants of problems referred to as Remote Associate Tasks
   (RATs; see Mednick, 1962; Mednick & Mednick, 1967), for which the
   solution can be associated with each of the provided three words in
   different ways. For example, a RAT (e.g., same, tennis, and head), in
   contrast to a CRAT, can be solved by means of semantic association
   (tennis match), synonymy (same = match) and, as with CRATs, the
   formation of compound words (matchhead).

   Nowadays, both RATs and CRATs are commonly used tests of creativity
   within psychology and cognitive neuroscience. They have been employed,
   for example, to examine creativity in relation to sleep (e.g., Cai,
   Mednick, Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009), memory (e.g., Storm et
   al., 2011), attention (e.g., Ansburg & Hill, 2003), and attentional
   deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g., White & Shah, 2011), and they
   have additionally been employed in neuroimaging studies of creativity
   (e.g., Arden, Chavez, Grazioplene, & Jung, 2010). According to Bowden
   and Jung‐Beeman (2003), the popularity of these problems resides in the
   fact that they have an unambiguous, single‐word answer, and that
   multiple items can be solved in a single session. Furthermore, RATs and
   CRATs are less complex than classic insight problems such as the candle
   problem or two‐string problem (see Weisberg, 1995), such that they are
   less susceptible to confounding of variables. These characteristics
   made these problems very appealing for the current investigation.

   Problem solving performance on RATs and CRATs has been found to
   correlate with performance on other creative tasks such as rebus
   puzzles (MacGregor & Cunningham, 2008; see Threadgold, Marsh, & Ball,
   2018, for further discussion) and classic insight tasks (Schooler &
   Melcher, 1995; but see Webb, Little, Cropper, & Ruze, 2017). Such
   patterns of association suggest that RATs and CRATs represent effective
   tests of creativity. Moreover, these problems also appear to involve
   “the same component processes critical for, and the same
   phenomenological experience of, insight solutions to more complex
   problems” (Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 2003, p. 634; see also Bowden &
   Jung‐Beeman, 2007). For example, the problems initially misdirect or
   fail to direct retrieval processes, thereby leading to an impasse. In
   addition, solvers often report an “Aha!” experience on task completion.
   As well as being characterised by the insight sequence, RATs and CRATs
   also appear to be underpinned by a range of other processes, including
   unconscious spreading activation in associative networks (Smith, Huber,
   & Vul, 2013), conscious verbal processes such as subvocal rehearsal
   (Ball & Stevens, 2009), and executive processes such as those that
   inhibit incorrect solution ideas and enable the active manipulation of
   information in working memory (Chein & Weisberg, 2014; Storm & Angello,
   2010).

   Although there is a paucity of research examining the effects of
   background music on creativity, there is a small literature on the
   impact of noise on creative cognition, with this research having
   typically used RATs, but occasionally other creative tasks too
   (Hillier, Alexander, & Beversdorf, 2006; Kasof, 1997; Martindale &
   Greenough, 1973; Mehta et al., 2012). For example, aperiodic noise such
   as white noise and pink noise has been shown to affect creativity, as
   measured using RATs. For example, Martindale and Greenough (1973;
   75 dB) and Hillier et al. (2006; 90 dB) showed that a high intensity
   white noise, compared with a no noise control condition, impaired task
   performance. Moreover, Kasof (1997) reported that a high level
   (85 dB[A]) of intermittent, compared with continuous, pink noise
   reduced creativity as measured with a poetry writing task. In contrast,
   Toplyn and Maguire (1991) found that highly creative participants (as
   gauged by their performance on RATs) demonstrated greater creativity on
   other tasks when exposed to 80 dB white noise, compared with when
   exposed to 60 or 100 dB white noise.

   Mehta et al. (2012) used more naturalistic, ambient noises to resemble
   restaurant noise, wherein distant construction noise, multitalker
   babble, and roadside traffic were blended and reported that a moderate
   level of noise (70 dB), as compared with low level noise (50 dB),
   improved performance on creative tasks. These tasks included RATs
   (Experiment 1), a task wherein participants generated novel ideas for
   improving mattress comfort (Experiment 2), a task requiring the
   generation of alternative uses for a brick (Experiment 3), and a task
   concerning how to clean scuffed shoes with no polish (Experiment 4). Of
   relevance to the present study, participants generated more correct
   answers to RATs in the presence of moderate noise compared with a low
   level of noise and a high level of noise (85 dB).

   We note here, however, that in contrast with the RATs, the other tasks
   used by Mehta et al. (2012) arguably make less demands on verbal
   working memory. Indeed, these tasks tap divergent thinking in that they
   require the production of multiple responses in a manner similar to
   standard verbal fluency tasks. Verbal fluency tasks require the
   production of numerous responses given a phonemic (produce words
   beginning with the letter “F”) or semantic (produce as many examples of
   “Fruit”) cue within a time limit (Jones, Marsh, & Hughes, 2012; Marsh,
   Crawford, Pilgrim, Sörqvist, & Hughes, 2017). Although some aspects of
   the task, such as the requirement to maintain memory for previously
   produced responses to avoid repetition tap verbal working memory, these
   tasks are not characterised by continuous generation and testing of
   word combinations and maintenance of intermediate solutions that
   distinguish the convergent thinking underpinning the RAT. Indeed,
   perhaps it is no surprise that tasks that tap divergent thinking such
   as category fluency tend to be immune to disruption produced by
   changing‐state background sound, unless it conveys semantic content
   (Jones et al., 2012). In this respect, our focus was on the variant of
   the RAT (i.e., the CRAT), since in contrast to divergent thinking
   tasks, CRATs should be more sensitive to disruption produced by the
   changing‐state acoustic properties of background sound.

   An alternative account of the relationship between background sound and
   creativity holds that benefits to cognitive task performance can be
   observed through mood and arousal (for a review, see Schellenberg,
   2005). For example, Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain (2001) showed
   that performance on tests of spatial abilities was improved when the
   tasks were executed after listening to music rated as “liked” by
   participants, as opposed to being exposed to quiet. Moreover, the
   improvement in performance was driven by changes in arousal and mood
   produced by listening to the music. It is important to note that mood
   and arousal are not the same construct. For example, mood can be
   decreased and arousal can be increased when music is disliked. It is
   possible that the effects of music on cognitive task performance are
   driven by changes to both mood and arousal, with increases in both
   leading to enhanced performance.

   A recent study by Ritter and Ferguson (2017) required participants to
   undertake tasks involving creative cognition while concurrently
   listening to music or exposure to quiet. In a between‐participants
   design, Ritter and Ferguson showed that a beneficial effect of music on
   creative task performance was limited to a comparison between a silent
   condition and a so‐called “happy music” condition (Vivaldi's “Four
   Seasons”). Exposure to “calm music,” “sad music,” and “anxious music”
   had no impact on creative task performance compared with quiet (but see
   Perham & Withey, 2012, for evidence of enhanced spatial rotation
   performance following listening to slow‐tempo, sad music of a
   participant's own choosing compared with a slow‐tempo control excerpt).
   In line with the notion that changes to mood and arousal may
   collectively enhance creative task performance, participants in Ritter
   and Ferguson's (2017) study assigned more positive mood and higher
   arousal to the happy music condition in comparison with the other
   conditions. Therefore, the benefit to creative task performance could
   have been driven by increases in mood and arousal rather than the
   presence of the music per se.

   Although the notion that increases in both mood and arousal can benefit
   creativity has some appeal, we note that Ritter and Ferguson (2017) did
   not report statistical comparisons between all of the music conditions
   in their between‐participants design, which potentially undermines
   their conclusions. Furthermore, Mehta et al. (2012) propose that
   arousal‐based explanations of the impact of to‐be‐ignored noise on
   creativity are insufficient because over a longer period of exposure to
   the sound, physiological arousal levels should normalise and cease to
   have a consistent influence. Thus, Mehta et al. argue that arousal is
   not the key contributing factor to the impact of to‐be‐ignored noise on
   creativity. They instead propose that moderate noise levels increase
   processing disfluency, with this processing disfluency increasing
   construal levels, thereby promoting more abstract thinking. More
   specifically, when construal levels are high, then individuals will
   engage in abstract thought to consider the “bigger picture” rather than
   focus on specific details (e.g., see Burgoon, Henderson, & Markman,
   2013). Such high‐level construal involves a focus on the commonality
   and central features of a situation such that its overall gist can be
   extracted. In contrast, the overall gist of a situation is less likely
   to be extracted when construal levels are low because people focus on
   peripheral (or secondary) features. In support of the influence of
   high‐level construal on creativity, research has demonstrated that
   performance on a wide range of creativity tasks can benefit from the
   experimental induction of abstract levels of thought (Friedman &
   Fӧrster, 2002; Fӧrster, Friedman, & Liberman, 2004).

   The processing disfluency account has its conceptual basis within
   research on metacognition, which focuses on processes that monitor and
   control cognition (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017a,b). Such metacognitive
   processes are involved in people's subjective judgements of how well a
   current task is being, could be, or has been performed. Metacognitive
   control processes about one's current task can be applied to initiate,
   terminate, or change the allocation of time, effort, and cognitive
   resources to the task (Ackerman & Thompson, 2017a). One of a variety of
   cues on which metacognitive monitoring is based is the subjective ease
   of processing (fluent vs. disfluent; easy vs. difficult) that derives
   from one's own experience at attempting the task. Subjective
   experiences of task difficulty can catalyse a shift in processing and
   engender increased task engagement (e.g., Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, &
   Eyre, 2007; Rummer, Schweppe, & Schwede, 2016).

   Attempts to comprehend metacognitive modulation of thought have
   typically evoked dual‐process theories, which posit the existence of
   two qualitatively distinct types of thinking: Types 1 and 2 processes
   (Evans & Stanovich, 2013a,b). Type 1 processes are autonomous and
   undemanding of working memory (a concept used in ways that links to
   notions of executive and attentional control) and tend to be fast,
   nonconscious, intuitive, and associative. On the other hand, Type 2
   processes rely on working memory (including executive and attentional
   control) and are focused on cognitive decoupling and mental simulation,
   critical for hypothetical thinking. Type 2 processes also tend to be
   slow, conscious, analytic, and deliberative. Type 2 processes can be
   activated if the monitoring system—as part of the metacognitive
   architecture—judges that a task is difficult (e.g., Bjork, Dunlosky, &
   Kornell, 2013; see also Thompson, 2010). Mehta et al. (2012) argue that
   the presence of noise creates processing disfluency and supports a
   processing shift inducing higher construal levels and more abstract
   thinking that is presumably linked to more diffuse associative
   processing of the type that is known to arise in creative insight. For
   example, in the case of CRATs, diffuse associative processing could
   cause spreading semantic activation within a network of associates
   yielding convergent activation on the word that the three seemingly
   unrelated words have in common, thereby yielding the solution (see
   Bowden & Beeman, 1998; Shen et al., 2017).

   That background sound can improve performance on creative tasks
   contrasts with a large literature relating to distraction of human
   cognition through exposure to noise (for reviews, see Beaman, 2005;
   Hughes & Jones, 2003). The task typically used to illustrate the
   vulnerability of cognition to disruption by the mere presence of
   to‐be‐ignored background sound is short‐term visual–verbal serial
   recall (Colle & Welsh, 1976; Jones & Macken, 1993; Salamé & Baddeley,
   1982). This task involves the visual presentation of verbal items
   (e.g., seven or eight letters or digits) with the requirement to recall
   these items according to the serial order in which they were presented.
   Initial work suggested that this disruption arose because the sound was
   composed of speech. However, the semantic properties of speech were
   found to be impotent in their capacity to disrupt serial recall: speech
   presented in a language understood by the participant produces no more
   disruption than that produced in a language incomprehensible to the
   participant (Jones, Miles, & Page, 1990). Thus, semantic properties of
   the to‐be‐ignored background sound were irrelevant to the level of
   disruption caused. Similarly, the notion that the disruption by
   background sound arose due to a confusion between phonemes derived from
   the visual items (via their covert articulation) that gain direct
   (spoken items) and indirect (visual items) access into a phonological
   store (Salamé & Baddeley, 1982) was undermined by findings that serial
   recall was shown to be susceptible to disruption by the presence of
   background music without lyrics, and therefore phonemes (Klatte,
   Kilcher, & Hellbrück, 1995; Klatte, Lachmann, Schlittmeier, &
   Hellbrück, 2010; Nittono, 1997; Salamé & Baddeley, 1989; Schlittmeier,
   Hellbrück, & Klatte, 2008), and by the presence of sequences of tones,
   provided they change from one successive tone to the next (Divin,
   Coyle, & James, 2001; Elliott, 2002; Jones & Macken, 1993).

   The key empirical referent for this so‐called “irrelevant sound effect”
   is the changing‐state effect. This concerns the finding that a changing
   sequence of sounds, regardless of whether the changes occur on a speech
   carrier (e.g., a sequence of different verbal tokens) or a nonspeech
   carrier (e.g., a sequence of tones of different frequency), disrupts
   serial recall to a far greater extent than a nonchanging or
   steady‐state sound (e.g., a repeated token or tone; Jones & Macken,
   1993; Jones, Madden, & Miles, 1992). According to the
   interference‐by‐process approach (e.g., Jones & Tremblay, 2000), the
   pre‐attentive processing of the order of changes within sound impairs
   the deliberate serial rehearsal process that supports the ordered
   recall of to‐be‐remembered items.

   Given that the solving of CRATs appears to be underpinned by verbal
   processes such as subvocal rehearsal (Ball & Stevens, 2009) in addition
   to executive processes (Chein & Weisberg, 2014) and spreading
   activation in associative networks (Smith et al., 2013), we expect
   CRATs to be susceptible to disruption by the presence of to‐be‐ignored
   background music. Our rationale behind suggesting that verbal
   processing of CRATs will be susceptible to changing‐state distraction
   is supported by the findings that impairment of CRAT performance
   through concurrent articulatory suppression is observed within this
   procedure, whereas facilitation of CRAT performance occurs via
   encouraging verbalisation through the “think aloud” technique (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009). Thus, the availability of speech (inner speech or
   external speech) is necessary for efficient CRAT problem solving
   performance. In the context of serial recall, the skill of speech (or
   rather speech planning) is co‐opted because it provides an effective
   medium for retaining visual–verbal items due to its inherent
   sequentiality, continuity, and prosodic and co‐articulatory nature.
   Inner speech therefore enables the grafting of serial order constraints
   onto the presented list; the act of covertly co‐articulating
   to‐be‐remembered items generates sequential information and constraints
   that do not occur within the list itself. However, this motoric based
   serial rehearsal process is subject to interference from the automatic,
   pre‐attentive processing of the serial order of changes in a background
   auditory sequence (such as music).

   In our recent work, it is becoming clearer that tasks that may not
   necessarily involve serial rehearsal, but that do involve the use of
   inner speech for effective task performance (e.g., face recognition;
   Marsh et al., 2018) are also vulnerable to the changing‐state effect.
   Of course, speech (inner or outer) involves planning of sequential
   motor acts, which may render it vulnerable to disruption via
   changing‐state speech in many settings. In the context of CRATs, inner
   (and outer) speech clearly supports effective performance (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009). It may even be that participants use serial rehearsal
   to test out novel solutions.

   We do not claim that CRAT performance is underpinned entirely by verbal
   maintenance processes. Rather, it is clear that spreading semantic
   activation processes (Smith et al., 2013), and executive processes that
   are involved in generating response candidates and inhibiting
   misleading/incorrect solutions (Storm & Angello, 2010) are also central
   to the production of responses. That said, it is often not clear which
   component of a multicomponent task is associated with CRAT performance.
   For example, the finding of an association between Working Memory
   Capacity measures and CRAT performance (Chein & Weisberg, 2014) could
   be due to the role of attentional/cognitive control (which may involve
   executive control processes such as inhibition) or the requirement to
   retain serial order information: Working Memory Capacity tasks involve
   combining the short‐term storage of visual/verbal items with a
   concurrent processing task. Therefore, we hold that subvocal
   maintenance processes involving inner speech can underpin solution of
   CRATs and that this process is susceptible to disruption via processing
   of a changing‐state auditory sequence. The aim of the series of three
   experiments that we present here was to investigate the impact of
   to‐be‐ignored background sound (i.e., music with foreign, [unfamiliar]
   lyrics; instrumental music; and music with familiar lyrics) on tasks
   believed to measure creativity, that is, CRATs.

1 EXPERIMENT 1

   The aim of Experiment 1 was to establish if music with unfamiliar
   lyrics facilitates creativity as measured via performance with CRATs
   through engendering processing disfluency (Mehta et al., 2012), or
   impairs creativity, possibly due to the disruption of verbal processes
   such as subvocal rehearsal (Ball & Stevens, 2009) due to its
   changing‐state characteristics. To investigate these two competing
   accounts and opposing predictions, we contrasted performance in a quiet
   condition to a condition with to‐be‐ignored background music with
   clearly discernible lyrics in a foreign language that were unfamiliar
   to the participants (i.e., the musical excerpt contained Spanish lyrics
   presented to native English speakers; thus, the lyrics were both
   unfamiliar and meaningless to the participants, who were unable to
   process their semantic content). As such, any observed disruption could
   not be viewed as being attributable to interference between the
   semantic properties of the to‐be‐ignored sound and the semantic
   processes underpinning the solving of CRATs (see Marsh et al., 2008,
   2009). If unfamiliar music engenders processing disfluency (cf. Mehta
   et al., 2012), then one should observe better performance when music,
   as compared with quiet, accompanies problem solving. However, if verbal
   processes underpinning CRAT performance are susceptible to disruption
   via changing‐state irrelevant sound—as the interference‐by‐process
   account would assume (Jones & Tremblay, 2000)—then performance should
   be poorer in the presence of music as compared with quiet.

1.1 Method

1.1.1 Participants

   Thirty adults (15 female and 15 male) from the University of Central
   Lancashire participated in the experiment (M = 22 years, SD = 2.78, age
   range 19 to 30 years old). The participants were recruited via an
   opportunity sample. Participants received course credit or the standard
   department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of participation time.
   All participants spoke English as their first language and reported
   normal (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and hearing. The experiment
   received Ethical Clearance from the University of Central Lancashire.

1.1.2 Design and materials

   The design was a fully within‐participants 2 × 2 design with Sound
   (Quiet vs. Spanish Music) and CRAT Difficulty (Easy vs. Difficult) as
   the factors. A set of 38 CRATs were selected from the problems
   developed by Bowden and Jung‐Beeman (1998) using the program “Match”
   (Van Casteren & Davis, 2007). Match automates the selection of several
   groups of smaller stimuli sets from a larger pool ensuring the groups
   are matched on multiple dimensions. Here, the sets of CRATs were
   matched on solution accuracy and solution time data provided by Bowden
   and Jung‐Beeman (1998). Each CRAT consisted of the presentation of
   three single words, with the participant having to find a word that
   combines with each of the three presented words to make a common word
   or phrase. For example, if participants are presented with the words
   stick/maker/point, then the word that links with each of these is the
   word match to create the phrases or words matchstick, match maker, and
   match point. Therefore, the answer or target in this instance would be
   the word “match.”

   The 38 selected CRATs were divided into a set of 20 easy CRATs (Easy
   CRATs' solution rates: M = 68.9%, SD = 16.2, Easy CRATs' solution
   times: M = 8.23 s, SD = 2.61) and 18 difficult CRATs (Difficult CRATs'
   solution rates: M = 26.6%, SD = 14.3, Difficult CRATs' solution times:
   M = 12.1 s, SD = 3.07). Each difficulty set was then further divided
   into two equal matched sets (Set A solution rates: M = 49.4%,
   SD = 26.1, solution times: M = 9.98 s, SD = 3.6 vs. Set B solution
   rates: M = 48%, SD = 27, solution times: M = 10.1 s, SD = 3.3) as
   indexed by normative data on solution rate and solution time data for
   30‐s presentation time provided by Bowden and Jung‐Beeman (1998). It is
   typical to divide CRAT sets into easy and difficult (Ball & Stevens,
   2009). Difficult, but not easy, problems can benefit from overt
   verbalisation, whereas preventing subvocalisation via requiring
   participants to suppress articulation while problem solving can hinder
   performance with both easy and difficult problems (Ball & Stevens,
   2009). Although not a primary goal of the study, we nevertheless
   considered it important to investigate the potential differential
   susceptibility to distraction of easy and difficult problems. The
   experiment was fully counterbalanced such that each CRAT set appeared
   within each sound condition.

1.1.3 Procedure

   Participants read an information sheet and completed a consent form
   prior to taking part in the experiment. Participants were given
   instructions for the CRATs that explained the need to find one target
   word per problem, that, when combined with the three presented words
   (either before or after the presented words), created a common word or
   phrase. Prior to the test problems, participants were asked to tackle
   five practice problems to ensure familiarity with the task. These
   practice problems were also selected from Bowden and Jung‐Beeman
   (1998). Participants were allocated 30 s per CRAT item. All three
   problem words were presented simultaneously along the same horizontal
   plane.

   The music was played via Sennheiser HD‐202 headphones at approximately
   65–70 dB(A). The music was a 30‐s segment of a Spanish translation of a
   1990s UK chart pop song played via E‐Prime Software that contained
   clearly discernable lyrics and accompanying instruments. The music
   contains appreciable acoustic variation and satisfied the criterion for
   being a changing‐state stimulus. In the sound condition, this music
   segment accompanied each CRAT problem, starting with the onset of the
   problem and ending once the participant indicated they had solved the
   CRAT by pressing the spacebar. After participants pressed the spacebar,
   a textbox appeared wherein participants typed their answer.
   Participants were asked to complete the CRATs while ignoring the
   background sound. They were also reassured that they would not be asked
   anything about the background sound. Participants were fully debriefed
   at the end of the task and thanked for their participation. During
   debriefing, participants were presented with the auditory stimuli they
   were exposed to during the experiment and asked if they were familiar
   with the song or had heard it before in experiment; none replied that
   they were or had.

1.2 Results

   The data for each of the three experiments can be found via the
   following link: https://osf.io/j6hwd/. The basic data pattern for the
   present experiment indicated that CRAT solution rates were higher in
   the quiet condition in comparison with the music condition.
   Furthermore, a greater number of easy CRATs were solved in comparison
   with difficult CRATs. To examine the data further, a 2 (Sound: Quiet
   vs. Spanish Music) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs. Difficult)
   within‐participants analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on mean
   solution rates (i.e., proportion correct). An alpha level of p < 0.05
   was adopted for all statistical tests. There was a significant main
   effect of Sound, F(1, 29) = 9.91, MSE = 0.01, p = 0.004, η[p]^2 = 0.25.
   Significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet condition (M = 0.43,
   SE = 0.04) in comparison with the Spanish music condition (M = 0.36,
   SE = 0.05). There was a main effect of CRAT Difficulty, F(1,
   29) = 63.36, MSE = 0.02, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.67, with significantly
   higher solution rates for the easy CRATs (M = 0.49, SE = 0.04) in
   comparison with the difficult CRATs (M = 0.29, SE = 0.05). There was no
   significant Sound × CRAT Difficulty interaction, F(1, 29) = 1.36,
   MSE = 0.02, p = 0.25, η[p]^2 = 0.05.

1.3 Discussion

   The aim of Experiment 1 was to compare CRAT performance in a quiet
   condition to performance when ignoring background music with unfamiliar
   foreign lyrics. Significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet
   condition relative to the background music condition. As anticipated,
   there was a significant difference in solution rates for the easy
   versus the difficult CRATs. Furthermore, there was no significant
   interaction between Sound and CRAT Difficulty for solution rates. That
   Sound impaired CRAT performance regardless of problem difficulty
   coheres with the findings of Ball and Stevens (2009), who demonstrated
   that articulatory suppression similarly impaired performance with easy
   and difficult tasks. However, the results are inconsistent with the
   general view that music enhances creativity, and dispute the prediction
   that background noise enhances creativity due to the promotion of
   processing disfluency and subsequent encouragement of abstract thought
   (Mehta et al., 2012). That CRAT performance was disrupted by the
   presence of a stimulus that conveyed no meaning to the participants
   precludes a semantic interference‐by‐process explanation of the results
   (cf. Marsh et al., 2008, 2009). However, the results are consistent
   with previous findings, which demonstrate background sounds that are
   meaningless to participants, can impair performance of tasks that
   require verbal working memory components such as serial recall,
   providing they possess appreciable changing‐state properties (e.g.,
   Jones et al., 1990): an acoustic interference‐by‐process (Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000).

2 EXPERIMENT 2

   Experiment 1 identified that music with foreign (unfamiliar) lyrics had
   a detrimental effect on the solution rates of CRATs in comparison with
   a quiet condition. At first glance, this finding is at odds with the
   notion that creative performance can be enhanced in the presence of
   background sound, through encouraging processing disfluency and
   promoting the abstract thought believed to be required to solve CRATs.
   However, Mehta et al. (2012) obtained facilitatory effects on CRAT
   performance with ambient sound comprising “multi‐talker noise in a
   cafeteria, roadside traffic, and distant construction noise to create a
   soundtrack of constantly varying background noise” (p. 786), whereas
   the current study used Spanish music with a clearly discernible voice
   (although in a language foreign to the participant, thereby conveying
   unfamiliar lyrics). We note that the presence of a clearly discernible
   voice could be a key difference between our study and that of Mehta et
   al. (2012) in driving the direction of the effect of background sound
   on creative performance. One possibility is that the presence of
   discernible speech in Experiment 1 could somehow prevent participants
   from achieving the disfluent processing state that could facilitate
   CRAT performance through abstract thought.

   To address this aforementioned issue, Experiment 2 compared a quiet
   background with music without speech (lyrics) to investigate whether
   the presence of speech in some way impedes disfluent processing and
   thus prevents any supposed benefits of such disfluent processing on
   CRAT performance. In terms of the contrasting view that background
   sound can impair creative processing through impairing verbal working
   memory, music without lyrics should impair CRAT performance similarly
   to Spanish music with a discernible voice. In support of this view,
   numerous studies in the context of serial‐verbal short‐term memory
   (Klatte et al., 1995; Klatte et al., 2010; Nittono, 1997; Salamé &
   Baddeley, 1989; Schlittmeier et al., 2008) have shown that the presence
   of speech is not a prerequisite to produce disruption of verbal working
   memory. Thus, on the interference‐by‐process account, music without
   lyrics (speech) would also be expected to disrupt the creative
   processes necessary for solving CRATs and Experiment 2 sought to
   determine whether this was indeed the case.

2.1 Method

2.1.1 Participants

   Eighteen adults (12 female and six male) from the University of Central
   Lancashire aged between 19 and 45 years old participated in the
   experiment (M = 25 years, SD = 9.31). The participants were recruited
   via an opportunity sample and received course credit, or the standard
   department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of participation. All
   participants spoke English as their first language and reported normal
   (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and normal hearing. The experiment
   received Ethical Clearance from the University of Central Lancashire.

2.1.2 Design and materials

   The design and materials were identical to those outlined in Experiment
   1 above, with the exception of a manipulation to one of the levels of
   the within‐participant factors, Sound, which had two levels: Quiet vs.
   Music without Lyrics. The sound used within Experiment 2 was therefore
   the same as that used in Experiment 1, but without the lyrical content.

2.1.3 Procedure

   Each participant read an information sheet and signed a consent form
   prior to beginning the experiment. The procedure remained identical to
   that reported in Experiment 1 outlined above. All participants were
   fully debriefed at the end of the experiment. As with Experiment 1, at
   debriefing, participants were presented with the auditory stimuli they
   were exposed to during the experiment and asked if they were familiar
   with the song or had heard it before the experiment. None of the
   participants reported familiarity with the song, nor hearing it
   previously.

2.2 Results

   The pattern of results in the present experiment replicated that found
   in Experiment 1. CRAT solutions were higher in the quiet condition in
   comparison with the music condition. Furthermore, a greater number of
   easy CRATs were solved in comparison with difficult CRATs. A 2 (Sound:
   Quiet vs. Music without Lyrics) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs.
   Difficult) within‐participants ANOVA was conducted on the dependent
   variable of mean solution rate. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was adopted
   for all statistical tests. There was a significant main effect of
   Sound, F(1, 17) = 8.60, MSE = 0.02, p = 0.009, η[p]^2 = 0.34.
   Significantly more CRATs were solved in the Quiet condition (M = 0.39,
   SE = 0.04) in comparison with the Music without Lyrics condition
   (M = 0.29, SE = 0.03). There was a main effect of CRAT Difficulty, F(1,
   17) = 61.05, MSE = 0.03, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.78, with significantly
   higher solution rates for the easy CRATs (M = 0.48, SE = 0.05) in
   comparison with the difficult CRATs (M = 0.19, SE = 0.03). There was no
   significant Sound × CRAT Difficulty interaction, F(1, 17) = 2.51,
   MSE = 0.02, p = 0.13, η[p]^2 = 0.13.

2.3 Discussion

   The aim of Experiment 2 was to compare CRAT performance in a quiet
   condition versus performance with to‐be‐ignored background music
   without lyrics. This was to investigate whether the presence of speech
   in Experiment 1 produced disruption of CRAT performance, and if this
   effect would hold for music without any speech content (in other words,
   music without lyrics). Experiment 2 supported the findings of
   Experiment 1 in that significantly more CRATs were solved in the quiet
   condition in comparison with the music without lyrics condition.
   Consistent with Experiment 1, there was a significant difference in
   solution rates for the easy versus the difficult CRATs. Furthermore,
   there was no significant interaction between Sound and CRAT Difficulty
   for solution rates.

   The results are again inconsistent with the general view that music
   enhances creativity, and instead we demonstrate a deficit to CRAT
   performance in the presence of to‐be‐ignored background music with
   unfamiliar lyrics (Experiment 1) as well as in the absence of lyrics
   (Experiment 2). Moreover, the results oppose the view that background
   noise leads to processing disfluency, which in turn promotes creativity
   by engendering increased abstract thought (Mehta et al., 2012). The
   results run counter to the idea that the failure to find facilitation
   of CRAT performance via background music was due to the presence of
   speech in Experiment 1. Here, we demonstrate in Experiment 2 that music
   without lyrics (i.e., in the absence of any speech content) still
   failed to produce a facilitation in creativity and in fact resulted in
   a decrement in creativity in comparison with a quiet condition.

   Taken together, the findings of Experiments 1 and 2 support the notion
   that verbal working memory is necessary for CRAT performance (Ball &
   Stevens, 2009), and that this is susceptible to disruption by the
   presence of to‐be‐ignored background sound, regardless of whether this
   background sound is speech or nonspeech based (e.g., Jones & Macken,
   1993).

3 EXPERIMENT 3

   As we have discussed in our introduction, both the
   interference‐by‐process view (Jones & Tremblay, 2000) and the
   processing disfluency view (Mehta et al., 2012) eschew the role of mood
   and arousal in mediating the effect of background sound on creative
   task performance. However, there is a compelling literature showing
   that increased mood and arousal that derives from listening to music
   may affect cognitive task performance. For example, Thompson et al.
   (2001) demonstrated a benefit to subsequent visuo‐spatial task
   performance from prior listening to music as compared with exposure to
   quiet that was entirely dependent on the change in mood and arousal
   that the music produced. Furthermore, Ritter and Ferguson (2017)
   reported that music presented 15 s prior to, and concurrently with, the
   performance of a task that involved creative verbal cognition
   facilitated performance on that task. However, this facilitatory effect
   occurred only for “happy” music that engendered positive affect and
   increased arousal. The relationship between happy music and increased
   arousal is usually attributed to the music's higher tempo (Vieillard et
   al., 2008). Moreover, music that is rated as being “liked” is typically
   “happy” music (Husain, Thompson, & Schellenberg, 2002). Therefore, it
   remains possible that given the pleasure that individuals usually
   derive from music, the music one choses to listen to might typically
   induce a positive mood and increased arousal, thereby yielding a
   positive impact on task performance (Thompson et al., 2001),
   particularly for tasks that involve creativity (Ritter & Ferguson,
   2017). Indeed, previous research has established that positive mood can
   improve performance on RATs (Rowe, Hirsh, & Anderson, 2007). In both
   Experiments 1 and 2, our use of arbitrary music with foreign or
   “unfamiliar” lyrics, and music with the absence of lyrics, could have
   induced a neutral or even negative mood state in participants, which
   might have hindered the emergence of creative insight.

   To investigate any potential mediating impact of mood on CRAT
   performance in Experiment 3, participants tackled CRAT problems in the
   presence of music with positive lyrics and fast tempo (approximately
   160 beats per minute), which we considered should increase positive
   affect and arousal. Indeed, research has identified that happy music
   typically has a tempo of around 150 beats per minute; thus, our musical
   condition exceeds this figure (Khalfa, Roy, Rainville, Dalla Bella, &
   Peretz, 2008). Furthermore, “happy” music is known to increase arousal
   (e.g., Salimpoor, Benovoy, Longo, Cooperstock, & Zatorre, 2009). To
   identify support for the assertion that music with a fast tempo is
   perceived as “happy,” we measured mood states at two different time
   points (i.e., before and after each background sound condition) using
   the Profile of Mood States (PoMS) questionnaire (McNair, 1971). In
   Experiment 3, we also acquired data relating to participants' musical
   preferences (i.e., whether they liked or disliked the presented
   background sound) and their study habits (i.e., whether they tend to
   study with music or without background music). These data were intended
   to be peripheral to the main findings, but they nevertheless had the
   capacity to provide an indication of whether the impact of mood on CRAT
   performance is influenced by either musical preference or study habits.

   We also note that in explaining the findings arising in Experiments 1
   and 2, yet another possibility is that the promotion of creativity
   through processing disfluency in the presence of background noise
   (Mehta et al., 2012) is a specific effect that is limited to the
   presence of relatively “steady‐state” sound, unlike the background
   music used in our conditions, which clearly satisfied the criteria for
   “changing‐state” sound. Therefore, in Experiment 3, we included a
   “library noise” condition, which resembled that used by Mehta and
   colleagues (Mehta et al., 2012). We contrasted this library noise
   condition with a music condition (i.e., popular music with familiar
   lyrics) and with a quiet condition.

   In terms of the outcomes of Experiment 3, if the mood and arousal
   account (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017; Thompson et al., 2001) is correct,
   then we expected to observe an increase in CRAT performance in the
   background music condition compared with the quiet and library noise
   conditions, assuming that the music condition reliably increases mood
   and arousal compared with the library noise condition. We note here
   that studies exploring the mood and arousal effect usually present
   music prior to, rather than concurrently with, the cognitive task of
   interest and typically study the effects of these music stimuli on
   visuo‐spatial performance such as mental rotation (Thompson et al.,
   2001). However, effects of music on creative task performance that are
   reportedly mediated through mood and arousal have also been shown when
   music is presented concurrently with the target task in the context of
   a verbally‐based creative task (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017). Moreover,
   participants within mood and arousal studies are free to attend to the
   music, rather than instructed to ignore the background sound, as is the
   case with studies of the irrelevant sound effect (Jones & Macken,
   1993). We make the assumption, however, that changes to mood and
   arousal induced by the presentation of music occurs regardless of
   whether participants are free to attend the music or requested to
   ignore it and explore this proposition.

   The processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012) would predict
   that both library noise and music conditions should increase CRAT
   performance, whereas the modified processing disfluency account only
   predicts a positive effect of background library noise on CRAT
   performance. Finally, the interference‐by‐process view (e.g., Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000) predicts that CRAT performance should be reduced in the
   music condition relative to the library noise and quiet conditions
   because the music condition comprises a changing‐state auditory
   stimulus, whereas the library noise condition constitutes a
   steady‐state stimulus.

3.1 Method

3.1.1 Participants

   Thirty‐six adults (23 female and 13 male) from the University of
   Central Lancashire aged between 19 and 56 years old participated in the
   experiment (M = 24 years, SD = 8.36). The participants were recruited
   via an opportunity sample. Participants received course credit, or the
   standard department payment rate in exchange for 30 min of
   participation. All participants spoke English as their first language
   and reported normal (or corrected‐to‐normal) vision and hearing.

3.1.2 Design

   In relation to the assessment of CRAT performance, the design was a 3
   (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy
   vs. Difficult) × 2 (Study Habit: Music vs. No Music) mixed design. For
   the purpose of mood evaluation, the following within‐participants
   design was used to determine mood changes using the PoMs questionnaire:
   3 (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (Time: Before vs.
   After) × 6 (Mood State: Tension vs. Depression vs. Anger vs. Confusion
   vs. Fatigue vs. Vigour). The music chosen for the background sound was
   a popular 2013 mid‐tempo soul and neo‐soul song that contained positive
   lyrics and had an upbeat melody. The library noise consisted of distant
   (nonintelligible) speech, photocopier noise, typing, and rustling of
   papers.

3.1.3 Materials

   Before undertaking the CRATs, participants were asked: “Do you
   ordinarily study in the presence of background music?” and responded
   yes or no. The PoMS questionnaire is designed to measure fluctuating
   feelings and affective states (for further details, see McNair, 1971).
   The questionnaire measures six different aspects of mood state:
   tension, depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour. According
   to instructions of administration, the six mood states can be combined
   in the following way to produce a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score:
   tension + depression + anger + confusion + fatigue − vigour. However,
   for the purposes of this design, we were interested in the specific
   mood profile, and therefore, the six specific profile scores were used
   rather than a general TMD measure (McNair, 1971).

   Using the norming data on solution rate and solution time for 30‐s
   presentation time, an additional set of 19 CRAT problems (10 easy and
   nine difficult) matching accuracy and solution times to Sets A and B
   was selected using the program “Match” (Van Casteren & Davis, 2007) to
   create Set C (solution accuracy M = 47.9%, SD = 25.7, solution times:
   M = 9.6 s, SD = 3.3). The experiment was fully counterbalanced such
   that each CRAT set appeared within each sound condition. After
   undertaking the CRATs, participants were asked: “Did you like the
   music?” and responded yes or no.

3.2 Results

   Like Experiments 1 and 2, the dependent variable was the mean solution
   rate for the CRAT problems. As mentioned in the foregoing, Experiment 3
   included a number of further dependent variables. These were responses
   to the PoMS questionnaires administered before and after the completion
   of each set of CRATs. The PoMS contains measures of six mood states:
   tension, depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour. There was
   also a brief questionnaire related to musical preference (whether
   participants liked the music played during the music condition) and
   study habits (whether they regularly listened to music when studying).
   Twenty‐nine participants responded that they liked the music and seven
   responded that they disliked the music, indicating that the vast
   majority of participants found the music appealing. Furthermore, 18
   participants responded that they ordinarily studied in the presence of
   music, whereas 18 preferred to study without the presence of music.
   Participants were assigned to Music vs. No Music for Study Habit,
   accordingly. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was adopted for all statistical
   tests used.

3.2.1 Solution rates

   The descriptive data for solution rates (see Figure 1) suggested that
   CRATs were more likely to be solved in the quiet and library noise
   conditions, in comparison with the music condition. However, there
   appeared to be no difference in the number of CRATs solved between the
   quiet and library noise conditions. Easy CRATs also seemed to be solved
   more readily than difficult CRATs. To examine these apparent effects
   further, a 3 (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (CRAT
   Difficulty: Easy vs. Difficult) × 2 (Study Habit: Music vs. No Music)
   mixed ANOVA was conducted on the solution rate data. There was a
   significant main effect of Sound on solution rates, F(2, 68) = 7.08,
   MSE = 0.07, p = 0.002, η[p]^2 = 0.12. Pairwise comparisons revealed
   that significantly more CRATs were solved in the Quiet condition
   (M = 0.34, SE = 0.05) in comparison with the Music condition (M = 0.30,
   SE = 0.04, p = 0.002). There were also significantly more CRATs solved
   in the Library Noise condition (M = 0.37, SE = 0.04, p = 0.003) in
   comparison with the Music condition. However, there was no significant
   difference between the mean number of CRATs solved in the Quiet and
   Library Noise conditions (p = 0.70).

   As expected, there was a significant main effect of CRAT difficulty on
   solution rates, F(1, 34) = 218.13.75, MSE = 0.02, p < 0.001,
   η[p]^2 = 0.87, with significantly more easy CRATs solved (M = 0.48,
   SE = 0.04) than difficult CRATs (M = 0.19, SE = 0.04). There was also
   no significant main effect of Study Habit on CRAT solution times, F(1,
   32) = 0.01, MSE = 0.26, p = 0.93, η[p]^2 = 0.000. Participants who
   specified that they preferred to study without music (M = 0.34,
   SE = 0.05) did not solve significantly more CRATs than those who
   specified that they preferred to study with music (M = 0.34,
   SE = 0.05). The remaining interactions and three‐way interactions all
   failed to reach significance (all ps > 0.05).

3.2.2 PoMs questionnaire

   To ascertain any changes in mood before and after completing the CRATs
   in each sound condition, a PoMS questionnaire was administered to
   participants at two different points (before and after completing the
   CRATs in each of the three sound conditions). Therefore, each
   participant completed the PoMS questionnaire a total of six times. A 3
   (Sound: Quiet vs. Music vs. Library Noise) × 2 (Time: Before vs.
   After) × 6 (Mood State: Tension vs. Depression vs. Anger vs. Confusion
   vs. Fatigue vs. Vigour) within‐participants ANOVA was conducted on the
   mood state scores. The ANOVA revealed that there was no significant
   main effect of Sound, F(2, 70) = 1.66, MSE = 0.20, p = 0.20,
   η[p]^2 = 0.05, with no significant difference in the mean mood state
   score in the Quiet (M = 5.89, SE = 0.54), Music (M = 5.65, SE = 0.58),
   and Library Noise (M = 6.10, SE = 0.54) conditions. There was a main
   effect of Time, F(1, 35) = 6.10, MSE = 9.98, p = 0.02, η[p]^2 = 0.15,
   with mean mood state scores significantly higher Before (M = 6.10,
   SE = 0.58) in comparison with After (M = 5.66, SE = 0.49) completing
   the CRATs. There was a significant main effect of Mood, F(5,
   175) = 28.17, MSE = 80.60, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.45. Pairwise
   comparisons indicated that there were significant differences between
   all mood states with the exception of tension (M = 5.05, SE = 0.67)
   versus fatigue (M = 5.13, SE = 0.78), depression (M = 2.86, SE = 0.87)
   versus anger (M = 5.13, SE = 0.78), anger versus fatigue, and fatigue
   versus vigour (M = 11.96, SE = 0.91; all ps > 0.05). There was no
   significant Sound × Time interaction, F(2, 70) = 2.43, MSE = 11.88,
   p = 0.10, η[p]^2 = 0.07, Sound × Mood interaction, F(10, 350) = 1.42,
   MSE = 8.25, p = 0.10, η[p]^2 = 0.07, or Time × Mood interaction, F(5,
   175) = 0.48, MSE = 5.18, p = 0.79, η[p]^2 = 0.01.

   As expected, there was a significant three‐way Sound × Time × Mood
   interaction, F(10, 350) = 3.50, MSE = 5.846, p < 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.09.
   Pairwise comparisons indicated the source of this significant
   interaction. For the Quiet condition, there was no significant change
   in any of the mood states after completing the CRATs (all ps > 0.05).
   However, for the Music condition, there was a significant change in
   mood for four out of the six mood states. There was a significant
   decrease in tension (M = 5.36, SE = 0.82 vs. M = 4.00, SE = 0.69,
   p = 0.01), anger (M = 4.08, SE = 1.04 vs. M = 2.72, SE = 0.69,
   p = 0.049), confusion (M = 6.92, SE = 0.75 vs. M = 5.69, SE = 0.59,
   p = 0.02), and fatigue (M = 4.81, SE = 0.87 vs. M = 3.72, SE = 0.80,
   p = 0.03). There was no significant change in depression (M = 3.25,
   SE = 1.23 vs. M = 2.61, SE = 0.98, p = 0.33) or vigour (M = 11.86,
   SE = 0.97 vs. M = 12.72, SE = 1.13, p = 0.22). For the Library Noise
   condition, there was no significant change in five of the six mood
   states (all ps > 0.05). However, there was a significant decrease in
   vigour (M = 12.67, SE = 1.08 vs. M = 10.67, SE = 0.94, p < 0.001).

   These findings indicate that the significant changes in mood states
   before and after completing CRATs occurred within the Music condition
   and not in the Quiet or Library Noise condition, thus indicating that
   music altered a number of mood states, and as measured by the PoMS,
   provided a general increase in positive mood. Since previous research
   (Rowe et al., 2007) has shown that positive mood can improve
   performance on RATs, the present observation that music increased mood
   but decreased CRAT performance suggests that a mood‐based explanation
   of the detrimental effect of music on creative insight seems
   implausible.

3.2.3 PoMs and solution rates

   In the previous section, the PoMS scores and CRAT solution rates were
   examined independently. However, it is useful to consider the possible
   impact of mood as a mediating influence on the relationship between
   to‐be‐ignored background sound and CRAT performance. Unfortunately, the
   current dataset is unsuitable for mediation analysis (i.e., to
   ascertain mood as a possible direct or indirect mediator in the
   relationship between background sound and CRAT performance) given the
   implementation of Sound as a within‐participants factor rather than a
   between‐participants factor. However, an analysis of covariance was
   performed to examine CRAT solution rates when mood score was included
   as a covariate. Here, we focused on the relationship between the quiet
   and music conditions, given our particular interest in the disruption
   caused by to‐be‐ignored background music.

   In order to establish the mood score for entry as a covariate, the
   “before” score for each of the six mood score dimensions (tension,
   depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and vigour) was subtracted from
   the “after” score to provide a “mood change” score for each of the six
   profile of mood state dimensions listed above. This resulted in a mood
   state dimension change score for both the music and quiet conditions,
   for each mood state (tension, depression, anger, confusion, anger, and
   vigour). The change score for the music condition was subtracted from
   the change score for the quiet condition, to provide a single change
   score for each of the six mood states. A 2 × 2 analysis of covariance
   was conducted (Sound: Quiet vs. Music) × 2 (CRAT Difficulty: Easy vs.
   Difficult) on solution rates, with tension, depression, anger,
   confusion, fatigue, and vigour each entered as a covariate. The
   findings revealed that all covariates failed to reach significance (all
   ps > 0.05), indicating that each of the six mood state measures failed
   to have a significant impact on CRAT solution rates, either directly or
   in interaction with the Sound and CRAT Difficulty factors.

3.3 Discussion

   Experiment 3 demonstrated that popular music with familiar lyrics
   disrupted CRAT performance (in terms of solution rates) in comparison
   with a quiet condition or library noise condition. However, there was
   no significant difference in CRAT performance between the quiet and
   library noise conditions. Mehta et al. (2012) previously demonstrated a
   beneficial effect to creativity with what could be termed “steady‐state
   sound.” Although these findings demonstrate that a steady‐state sound
   such as library noise does not result in a relative enhancement to
   creativity, we also find that the decrement was not significant,
   particularly in comparison with the background music with familiar
   lyrics.

   Furthermore, the findings imply that music with familiar lyrics
   resulted in a decrement in CRAT performance, despite an apparent
   overall positive increase in mood as identified by six mood states
   recognised in the PoMS. Given that previous research has identified
   that positive mood can lead to an improvement in RAT scores (Rowe et
   al., 2007), the findings here demonstrate that the decrement in
   performance in the music condition does not appear to be driven by
   mood. Indeed, these findings further support the notion that CRAT
   performance relies on verbal working memory, and that this is
   susceptible to disruption by nonsteady‐state sound, with or without the
   presence of speech.

4 GENERAL DISCUSSION

   In a series of three experiments, we investigated the impact of
   background music (with varying semantic properties) on creativity, as
   measured by performance on CRATs. In Experiment 1, background music
   with foreign (and therefore “unfamiliar”) lyrics resulted in a
   significant decrement to CRAT performance; significantly fewer CRATs
   were solved in the music with foreign lyrics condition in comparison
   with the quiet condition. This finding was replicated in Experiment 2
   with the implementation of background instrumental music in comparison
   with a quiet condition. In Experiment 3, familiar music was found to
   impair CRAT performance regardless of whether the music induced a
   positive mood or whether those participants typically studied in the
   presence of music. Moreover, disruption occurred despite the fact that
   the music was liked by the participants, which coheres with the
   findings of Perham and Vizard (2010) and Perham and Currie (2014), who
   showed equivalent disruption by liked and disliked background music in
   the context of serial recall and reading comprehension, respectively.

   Prior to discussing the implications of Experiments 1 to 3 for the
   theoretical accounts entertained, we undertook a Bayesian meta‐analysis
   of the collective findings. Bayes factors were calculated to quantify
   the evidence for two hypotheses: the hypothesis from the processing
   disfluency account (cf. Mehta et al., 2012) that CRAT performance would
   be better in the music conditions relative to the quiet conditions
   (H1), and the hypothesis from the auditory distraction account (Jones &
   Tremblay, 2000) that CRAT performance would be better in the quiet
   conditions relative to the music condition (H2).

   To calculate Bayes factors, one must specify the plausibility of effect
   sizes given one's theory. For both H1 and H2, we model the sort of
   effect size considered plausible on the results of Mehta et al. (2012),
   who reported that hearing a moderate level of noise resulted in
   participants solving a significantly greater proportion of RATs
   (M = 0.73) than participants in the quiet control condition (M = 0.56).
   These results provide an approximate effect size that could be expected
   for a noise manipulation (such as music) on measures of creativity,
   from 0.73 to 0.56 = 0.17. Following Dienes' (2011, 2014) guidelines,
   the experimental hypotheses in the current analyses were modelled using
   a half‐normal distribution with a mode of 0 and a standard deviation of
   0.17. Bayes factors <0.33 are interpreted as moderate evidence for the
   null hypothesis and Bayes factors >3 as moderate evidence for the
   experimental hypotheses. Bayes factors around 1 are conventionally
   considered inconclusive (Dienes, 2011, 2014). Bayes factors were
   calculated using Dienes and McLatchie's (2018) calculator (results
   following each experiment are reported on each row of Table 1).

   Individually, there was strong evidence across all three studies for H0
   relative to H1, indicating that playing music did not enhance
   creativity as measured by CRAT performance (see Table 1). In contrast,
   there was moderate to strong evidence from all three studies for H2
   relative to H0, suggesting that music decreased creativity to
   approximately the same extent one might have expected it to have
   increased (again refer to Table 1).

       Alternative hypotheses specified using a half‐normal distribution
       with a mode of zero and a standard deviation of 0.17 (Mehta et al.,
       2012; Experiment 1). CRAT: Compound Remote Associate Task.

   The experiment‐level analyses were followed up with a fixed‐effects
   meta‐analysis using Dienes' (2008) calculator (see Goh, Hall, &
   Rosenthal, 2016, for an overview of the benefits of including internal
   meta‐analyses within studies). The meta‐analytic posterior distribution
   (M = −0.06, SD = 0.01; 95% CI [−0.08, −0.03]) provides the best
   estimate of the population parameter and its uncertainty in light of
   all three studies. The meta‐analysis suggests that music reduces
   creativity as measured using the CRAT. Bayes factors were calculated on
   the meta‐analytic data to test H1 and H2 and revealed that the overall
   body of evidence provided substantial support for H2, that the presence
   of music diminishes rather than enhances creativity, B[H2/H1(0, 0.17)]
   = 3.36 × 10^4, thereby supporting the interference‐by‐process account
   (Jones & Tremblay, 2000) over the processing disfluency account (Mehta
   et al., 2012).

   Taken together, the findings from Experiments 1 to 3, supported by our
   Bayesian meta‐analysis, contradict the popular opinion that background
   music enhances creativity. Instead, they demonstrate that background
   music, with or without familiar semantic content (i.e., lyrics), or in
   the absence of speech, disrupts performance on CRATs, which represent a
   class of highly researched verbal problem solving tasks that are often
   solved creatively through insight‐based processes. Furthermore, the
   findings of Experiments 1 to 3 undermine the processing disfluency
   account (Mehta et al., 2012), which predicts superior performance in
   the presence of moderate intensity background noise in comparison with
   quiet. We note that a reprieve for the account might be offered if one
   were to assume that music (at least pleasant music) impairs creativity
   via inducing processing fluency (Mehta et al., 2012, p. 796). However,
   it is not immediately obvious why, on the processing disfluency
   account, noise and music should differ in relation to the processing
   fluency that they hypothetically engender.

   We contend that the deficit in CRAT performance in the presence of
   background music appears altogether more consistent with the
   interference‐by‐process framework (e.g., Marsh et al., 2009) than with
   the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012). According to
   the interference‐by‐process approach, the disruption of CRAT
   performance is attributable to the changing‐state effect, which refers
   to the finding that a changing sequence of sound (regardless of whether
   the changes occur on a speech or nonspeech carrier), disrupts serial
   recall to a far greater extent than a nonchanging or steady‐state sound
   (e.g., a repeated token or tone; Jones & Macken, 1993; Jones et al.,
   1992). The pre‐attentive perception of changes between elements in the
   sound, as a by‐product of acoustic‐based perceptual organisation
   processes (Bregman, 1990), gives rise to irrelevant order cues. These
   cues compete with the process responsible for subvocally maintaining
   the to‐be‐remembered items in sequence. In support of this suggestion,
   we have recently found that changing‐state letters (c, t, g, u) produce
   more disruption to CRAT performance than steady‐state letters (c, c, c,
   c; Marsh, Threadgold, Barker, & Ball, 2017). Music, of course, is a
   changing‐state, rather than a steady‐state, sound. Therefore, the
   findings presented here, which attest to the disruption to verbal
   insight problem solving as measured through CRAT performance, are
   entirely consistent with findings that have revealed a disruption to
   serial recall by changing‐state sounds that include music (e.g., Perham
   & Vizard, 2010). Furthermore, the findings imply that the presence or
   absence of semantic content (i.e., lyrics)—and indeed the familiarity
   of the lyrics (e.g., lyrics in foreign and unfamiliar language)—does
   not alter the disruptive influence of background music. Moreover, that
   background music successfully increased mood and arousal in Experiment
   3, but led to poorer, rather than better, CRAT performance compared
   with the quiet control and library noise condition undermines the mood
   and arousal account (Ritter & Ferguson, 2017; Schellenberg et al.,
   2007).

   One explanation for why background music impairs CRAT performance in
   the same way as it impairs serial recall (e.g., Salamé & Baddeley,
   1989) relates to the processes of verbal working memory and their
   importance for insight problem solving. Indeed, Ball and Stevens (2009)
   identified a strong verbal component to the solving of insight‐based
   CRATs, in that implementing a “think aloud” process during problem
   solving reliably enhanced solution rates. If verbal working memory is
   important for CRAT performance, and any nonsteady‐state background
   sound (such as music) is disruptive to the creative and analytic
   processes necessary to solve CRATs, a decrement to CRAT performance
   would be expected. This, therefore, suggests that it is not the type of
   semantic content within the to‐be‐ignored background per se that is
   disruptive to insight problem solving, but rather the presence of
   changing‐state sound and its impact on verbal working memory processes
   (such as rehearsal) underpinning the solving of CRATs. It might be, for
   example, that participants rehearse various target solutions, before
   obtaining an appropriate solution word. For example, for the problem
   “house,” “pear,” and “family,” it might be the case that “tree‐house”
   and “pear‐tree” are rehearsed, whereas participants test out the
   viability of another generated word, including the solution,
   “family‐tree.” That solution words can either serve as a prefix or a
   suffix to problem words may reinforce the rehearsal strategy because
   order processing is necessary to obtain an appropriate solution
   (“tree‐pear” being an appropriate combination of the problem and
   solution word but in the reverse order). However, because semantic
   associative processes are likely to be involved in CRAT solving (Smith
   et al., 2013), it would be reasonable to predict that meaningful
   background speech in a participant's mother tongue, as compared with
   meaningless background speech (speech in a language foreign to the
   participant), could produce additional disruption to CRAT solving,
   superimposed on the changing‐state effect, as a consequence of a
   semantic interference‐by‐process. The general notion is that disruption
   over and above the changing‐state effect can occur when there is a
   conflict between semantic processing of the sound and semantic
   processing in the focal task (Jones et al., 2012; Marsh et al., 2009).
   For example, in the context of mental arithmetic, Perham, Marsh,
   Clarkson, Lawrence, and Sörqvist (2016) argued that the additional
   disruption due to an ascending sequence of number distracters as
   compared with a random sequence was produced due to an additional
   priming process that was superimposed upon the interference‐by‐process
   that underpinned the changing‐state effect.

   One challenge that stems from the finding that background music impairs
   CRAT solving relates to determining the generalisability of the
   observed effect beyond CRATs alone. CRATs are but one example of a
   verbal insight problem solving task, albeit a popular and widely used
   example that is believed to provide an effective test of creativity
   (e.g., Bowden & Jung‐Beeman, 1998; Mednick, 1962). However, many other
   types of verbal and non‐verbal insight problem solving tasks exist
   (e.g., see Gilhooly, Fioratou, & Henretty, 2010). An important
   consideration is to what extent do the explanations presented here in
   terms of interference‐by‐process and working memory generalise to
   further insight problem solving tasks in both the verbal and visual
   domain?

   In relation to this latter question, preliminary evidence from Ball,
   Marsh, Litchfield, Cook, and Booth (2015) suggests that non‐verbal
   (i.e., visuo‐spatial) insight problem solving may in fact be
   facilitated, rather than hampered by background sound. Participants
   solved “classic” non‐verbal insight problems (such as the pigs‐in‐pens
   problem; see Schooler, Ohlsson, & Brooks, 1993) more accurately, and
   faster, when background sound was presented (in a form that involved
   repeated, canonical counting of the digit sequence 1 to 7) compared
   with a quiet background. According to Ball et al. (2015), these results
   can be interpreted in terms of background sound impairing inner speech,
   thereby permitting the operation of nonreportable, “special processes”
   (e.g., problem restructuring) that are critical for enabling successful
   solutions to emerge in classic insight‐based problem solving tasks
   involving predominantly visuo‐spatial components. It is our conjecture
   that background music would have a similar positive effect to this, yet
   it would be the changing‐state properties of the to‐be‐ignored
   background music, rather than the music per se, that would underpin an
   apparent enhancement in creativity. In sum, boundary effects are likely
   to be evident in terms of the following: (a) the relationship between
   background music and creativity; (b) the negative consequences of
   background music on verbal insight problem solving tasks as
   demonstrated here with CRATs; and (c) the positive consequences on
   visuo‐spatial insight problem solving tasks (e.g., Ball et al., 2015).

   One further point of consideration is that Mehta et al. (2012) found
   facilitatory effects of background sound for a number of different
   tasks that are thought to tap creativity. Although we found no evidence
   for the processing disfluency account (Mehta et al., 2012) in the
   context of our current study, it is possible that other tasks, or their
   component processes, are more sensitive to the potential engendering of
   processing disfluency—and thus enhancement of cognition—via the
   presence of background noise. Arriving at a CRAT solution may involve
   multiple processes that include a delicate balance between top‐down
   processes (e.g., rehearsal and executive control, such as inhibition in
   the case of excluding incorrect response candidates) and bottom‐up
   processes, such as spreading activation in associative, semantic
   networks that provide the candidate responses (cf. Benedek et al.,
   2016). Because it is likely that the balance between these top‐down and
   bottom‐up processes may differ substantially between different insight
   problems, different susceptibility to distraction by background sound
   is likely across different types of problem solving tasks solved via a
   process of insight. In this way, it is possible that any advantage to
   creative problem solving promoted by processing disfluency due to the
   presence of background noise may be dependent upon the particular
   strategy and processes used to solve a CRAT. It is reasonable to
   suggest that such strategies and processes could differ on a
   problem‐by‐problem basis.

   Although we argue that our results can be explained in terms of the
   interference‐by‐process account (Jones & Tremblay, 2000), it is
   important to note that there are two competing explanations for a
   deficit in CRAT performance with background noise, which both stem from
   well‐established theories of creativity. One such explanation derives
   from the “broad attentional scope” (BAS) view of creativity (Zabelina,
   O'Leary, Pornpattananangkul, Nusslock, & Beaman, 2015), whereas the
   other derives from the “focused attentional scope” (FAS) perspective
   (Gilhooly, Fioratou, Anthony, & Wynn, 2007). The BAS view supposes that
   background sound may reduce the overall amount of attention that one
   can apply to the problem solving task, resulting in a diffuse
   attentional state that can facilitate insight problem solving (Jarosz,
   Colflesh, & Wiley, 2012). In comparison, the FAS view proposes that if
   background sound reduces overall attention, then insight problem
   solving will be impaired. This FAS view is consistent with theories of
   distraction that assume the presence of background sound captures
   attention away from the focal task (Cowan, 1995) or reduces the overall
   amount of attention applied to the focal task (Neath, 2000), thus
   impairing observed performance. Across three experiments, we
   demonstrate a deficit to CRAT performance with distraction via
   to‐be‐ignored background music. Such a deficit to creativity is
   consistent with the importance of FAS in verbal insight problem solving
   such as with CRATs.

   One might assume that the findings reported here suggest that a
   disruption to FAS is generated by to‐be‐ignored background music, and
   that this is disruptive to the analytic and associative processes
   necessary to solve insight problems. However, there are two key
   problems with this assumption. First, there was nothing inherent within
   the presented background sound that was likely to capture attention and
   thus disrupt the attention directed towards the task at hand. Moreover,
   the notion that the overall amount of attention that could be applied
   to the focal task is reduced in the presence of background sound is
   inconsistent with the literature showing that only tasks that require
   verbal rehearsal are susceptible to distraction (Beaman & Jones, 1997;
   Jones & Macken, 1993). Second, if background sound impaired a focused
   attentional state necessary to solve insight problem solving tasks,
   then one would expect disruption, not facilitation, on tasks that
   require visuo‐spatial insight problem solving, similar to that found
   with verbal insight problem solving. However, evidence from Ball et al.
   (2015) and the findings presented here suggest a dissociation in the
   facilitatory and disruptive effects of to‐be‐ignored background sound
   on verbal and visuo‐spatial insight problems, respectively.

   To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music
   enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of
   the presence of semantic content (no lyrics, familiar lyrics, or
   unfamiliar lyrics), consistently disrupts creative performance in
   insight problem solving as measured by CRATs.

Abstract

   Characters which are closely linked to fitness often have low
   heritabilities (V[A]/V[P]). Low heritabilities could be because of low
   additive genetic variation (V[A]), that had been depleted by
   directional selection. Alternatively, low heritabilities may be caused
   by large residual variation (V[R]=V[P] – V[A]) compounded at a
   disproportionately higher rate than V[A] across integrated characters.
   Both hypotheses assume that each component of quantitative variation
   has an independent effect on heritability. However, V[A] and V[R] may
   also covary, in which case differences in heritability cannot be fully
   explained by the independent effects of elimination‐selection or
   compounded residual variation.

   We compared the central tendency of published behavioural
   heritabilities (mean=0.31, median=0.23) with morphological and life
   history data collected by 26). Average behavioural heritability was not
   significantly different from average life history heritability, but
   both were smaller than average morphological heritability. We
   cross‐classified behavioural traits to test whether variation in
   heritability was related to selection (dominance, domestic/wild) or
   variance compounding (integration level). There was a significant
   three‐way interaction between indices of selection and variance
   compounding, related to the absence of either effect at the highest
   integration level. At lower integration levels, high dominance variance
   indicated effects of selection. It was also indicated by the low CV[A]
   of domestic species. At the same time CV[R] increased
   disproportionately faster than CV[A] across integration levels,
   demonstrating variance compounding. However, neither CV[R] nor CV[A]
   had a predominant effect on heritability. The partial regression
   coefficients of CV[R] and CV[A] on heritability were similar and a path
   analysis indicated that their (positive) correlation was also necessary
   to explain variation in heritability. These results suggest that
   relationships between additive genetic and residual components of
   quantitative genetic variation can constrain their independent direct
   effects on behavioural heritability.

Introduction

   8) argued there is a connection between the nature of a character and
   the magnitude of its heritability: characters with the lowest
   heritabilities are those most closely connected with fitness, whereas
   characters with the highest heritabilities are the least connected to
   fitness. This has been repeatedly confirmed (26; 32; 12, p. 470) and
   has been widely interpreted as evidence for Fisher's fundamental
   theorem. The standard interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem is
   that additive genetic variation (V[A]) of fitness‐related traits should
   be low as alleles directly regulating fitness will be rapidly fixed by
   elimination selection (23). It follows that heritability
   (h^2=V[A]/V[P]) of a character should decrease with the strength of its
   relationship to fitness, and empirical studies have repeatedly
   supported this prediction (10; 26; 16; 19; 24). However, 28) and 7)
   argue that Fisher's fundamental theorem did not apply to mean
   reproductive fitness of a population, but describes the partial change
   in fitness due to changes in gene frequency at a single locus.
   Regardless of Fisher's intent, directional selection on a phenotypic
   character can reduce its additive genetic variation (9; 31). Thus,
   negative relationships between a character's heritability and its
   relationship with fitness (10; 19; 24) suggest the magnitude of
   heritability reflects the nature of selection on a character
   (elimination‐selection hypothesis –16, 17) and indicates the level of a
   character's additive genetic variation (V[A]).

   At the same time, quantitative trait structure (number of component
   characters and their relationships) has both a positive effect on
   additive genetic variance (thereby increasing V[A]/V[P]), and a
   negative effect on heritability estimates through increased residual
   variance (V[R]=V[P] – V[A]) in its denominator. Both additive genetic
   and residual life history variation may be integrated across related
   component (i.e. morphological) traits (15; 29) and residual variation
   may be compounded through ontogeny (2) reported that mean standardized
   estimates of additive genetic trait variation (CV[A]– additive genetic
   coefficient of variation) are higher on average in life history than in
   morphological characters and this result has been confirmed in two wild
   populations (19; 24). The idea that life history traits compound
   effects of larger numbers of loci is also supported by the higher
   mutational variation of life history characters compared with
   morphological characters (18; 17). Thus, the effect of compounded
   residual variation in life history characters must be
   disproportionately large and practically independent of (compounded)
   additive genetic variation to explain why their heritabilities are
   smaller on average than those of morphological characters (24).
   Repeated observation of larger differences in residual variation (16;
   27; 19; 24) imply that the difference between heritabilities of these
   character categories occurs in spite of their higher average levels of
   additive genetic variation, and because of their differences in V[R],
   measured by the coefficient of residual variation (CV[R]–16; 18; 23,
   24). However, in each of the studies cited above, there are strong
   positive correlations between CV[A] and CV[R] which may constrain their
   independent effects on heritability.

   Tests of elimination‐selection and variance compounding hypotheses
   contrast expectations of the difference between morphological and life
   history characters. Behavioural characters are excluded from these
   analyses, possibly because their relationship to fitness is not certain
   (16), and in practice because the number of available estimates is
   typically low (26; 14). Nonetheless, 13) summarized the presumed
   relationships of behavioural categories, classified by the number of
   other component behaviours that they integrate (integration level) and
   their relationship with fitness. For instance, Henderson argues that
   mating behaviour, parental care and foraging behaviour integrate a
   large number of component characters such as reflex and display
   behaviours. 13) also argues that highly integrated behaviours are
   closely related to fitness. All else being equal, he suggests that
   elimination‐selection should reduce additive variation most strongly in
   highly integrated behaviours. In other words, they should have lower
   CV[A] and heritability. Applying variance compounding hypotheses to
   behavioural traits suggests that residual variation should be the
   highest among highly integrated behaviours, or they should have higher
   CV[R] and lower heritability. At the same time, the positive covariance
   between residual and additive genetic variation may constrain the
   expected independent effects of additive genetic and residual variation
   on heritability of behavioural characters.

   We compiled estimates of heritability published after 1988 to collect a
   large enough sample size to test Falconer's hypothesis that the nature
   of a character determines its heritability. We first tested whether (1)
   behavioural heritabilities are different on average than either life
   history or morphological heritabilities (26; 31) and (2) that CV[A] and
   CV[R] estimates have significant, independent (CV[A]– positive, CV[R]–
   negative) effects on behavioural heritability estimates. We then (3)
   used behavioural ecology categories to classify heritabilities, CV[A]
   and CV[R] by their presumed relationship with reproductive fitness. We
   also (4) indirectly test whether selection regulates heritability given
   that stronger selection should increase dominance variation (4; 23).
   Finally, we cross‐classified these traits by their integration level
   (or differences in structure) to test whether (5) selection and
   structure have independent effects on average heritability. In summary,
   our interest is not only in determining whether quantitative estimates
   of genetic variation vary between different categories of behaviour,
   but also in testing in one study the presumed effects of both selection
   and structure on the genetic architecture of behaviour.

Methods

Data sources

   We used heritability of morphology and life history estimates reported
   by 26) to test whether behavioural heritability is larger on average
   than life history heritability and smaller than average morphological
   heritability (26; 14). We collected 428 behavioural heritability
   estimates from 79 reports not cited in 26) or 32), published up to the
   year 2000 (Table 1). Unlike 26) we included both broad and narrow sense
   estimates of heritability and we collected estimates made on both
   domestic and wild species. Behavioural heritability estimates were
   reported for vertebrates (mammals, fish, reptiles, birds) and
   invertebrates (insects and crustaceans). 26) and 32) previously
   collected 154 estimates. We first tested whether both data sets (recent
   and older) differed in central tendency.
   Table 1. Species, it's classification and the literature source for the
   recent behavioural heritabilities and CV's compiled in this study. Each
   species was classified as wild (w), domestic (d), or semidomestic (s)
   based on the source of the population, the description of its
   maintenance and the purpose of the study. image
   Table 1. (Contd.) image

   We used an average heritability estimate if there were multiple
   estimates of heritability for one population in the same environment.
   Similarly, if trait heritability was estimated separately for males and
   females in a single study, then we averaged the two estimates. But, if
   the heritability of a trait was estimated for two different populations
   of the same species, or for the same population in different
   environments, then we included both estimates. 26) reported that
   differences between invertebrates and vertebrates were nonsignificant.
   We found similar results for behavioural characters listed in Table 1
   (invertebrate: h^2 ± SE=0.30 ± 0.02 vertebrate: 0.27 ± 0.02;
   t[580]=0.85, P=n.s.). In general, we do not have a priori expectations
   that species or higher level taxa should differ in their average
   heritability. But, heritability estimates may be affected by
   domestication or long‐term maintenance under laboratory conditions.

Analysis

   26) found that central tendency of behavioural and life history
   heritabilities did not differ when they used means and medians as the
   test statistic, and they suggested the low sample size of behavioural
   traits may have led to this result. Based on 26) data we estimated that
   the minimum sample size required to reject the null hypothesis at
   α=0.05 should be 946 (35). Our combined life history and behavioural
   trait sample size was 931. We added the life history estimates reported
   by 19), 24), 14) and 25) so that our final sample size was 948. Thus,
   our parametric hypothesis test should be powerful enough to reject the
   null hypothesis that life history and behavioural heritabilities are
   not significantly different. We used both parametric (ANOVA, Welch
   ANOVA, t‐test) and a median test for testing the significance of
   differences in central tendency. Welch's ANOVA uses an F statistic with
   degrees of freedom that are adjusted for unequal variances. We used the
   Welch ANOVA for our parametric tests of CV[A] and CV[R] categories, as
   category variance estimates differed widely and Welch ANOVA is not
   sensitive to violations of variance homogeneity (6). The median test
   compares the significance of differences between medians of each
   category relative to a combined or grand median. Although it is not as
   powerful as a parametric test, it tests the significance of differences
   in population medians (35), which in a skewed population can be a
   better measure of central tendency.

Classification methods

   Our data set comprised a wide variety of behavioural traits, ranging
   from behaviour closely associated with life history (e.g. predator
   avoidance, mating preferences, oviposition behaviour) to traits with
   domestic or economic importance, but little direct ecological relevance
   (e.g. trot stride).

Wild, domestic, semidomestic

   There were few (3) field estimates of behavioural heritability. Almost
   all of the measurements were collected in a laboratory or farm
   environment. If a species or a population had not been selected for an
   economic purpose, we classified their heritability estimates as `wild'.
   In this respect our terminology is consistent with 26) classification,
   although `nondomestic' may be a better description. Included in this
   category were a number of heritabilities estimated for populations
   which may have been maintained under laboratory conditions for a large
   number of generations (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster). These may not
   have been subjected to artificial selection intentionally, but
   heritability estimates could reflect ongoing adaptation to their
   maintenance conditions (11). For example, heritability estimates for
   Drosophila (32; 14) are lower in each trait category than the averages
   for wild (nondomestic) populations (26). We classified these
   populations as semidomestic and the remaining populations as domestic.

Estimation method

   Additive genetic variation could be estimated using broad sense and
   full sib breeding designs which include all or part of the dominance
   variance component and the between – family environmental component.
   These variance components are not included in half sib, maximum
   likelihood or regression estimates. Consequently, we expect the former
   heritability estimates should be higher on average than the latter and
   interpret the difference between them as an index of the strength of
   recent selection (5; 22; 4). Similar reasoning suggests domestic
   behaviours should also have higher levels of dominance than wild
   behaviours (26; 4). There were eight estimation methods in our combined
   data set: ANOVA (n=69); broad sense (n=49); full sib (n=63); half sib
   (n=172); maximum likelihood animal models (n=25); regression techniques
   (n=69); diallel cross (n=58); and selection studies (n=76). We dropped
   the diallel cross data from this analysis because it consisted almost
   entirely of data from one study.

Behavioural ecology trait types

   Different phenotype categories (morphology, life history, behaviour,
   etc.) may have different heritabilities because of their relationship
   with fitness (8; 26; 14). Following this logic, different categories of
   behaviour thought to be more or less closely related to fitness should
   also have different heritabilities. We classified traits into seven
   behavioural ecology categories (foraging, movement, predator avoidance,
   reproduction, social, temperament, plus one category for other traits).
   In testing variation among levels of this factor, we are interested in
   category averages rather than the heritability of a behaviour in a
   particular population that may or may not have been under directional,
   correllated or stabilizing selection.

Integration level

   13) argued that there is a hierarchy of behavioural phenotypes that
   differ in their level of analysis (see his Fig. 14‐1). Basic, narrowly
   defined phenotypes such as sensory responses, conditioned responses or
   reflexive behaviour having relatively few morphological or other
   behavioural components, were put into the low integration level
   category. Alternatively, sexual, maternal and foraging behaviour
   integrate morphological and other behavioural traits. We assigned these
   to the high integration level category. Traits which comprised
   behavioural clusters (e.g. activity level) but that we could not
   unambiguously assign to high integration level, we designated as
   `medium' integration level. 13) argues that selection should counteract
   the compounded (genetic) effects of pleiotropy and epistasis at higher
   integration levels. But, variance compounding hypotheses imply that
   residual variation should increase disproportionately faster than
   additive genetic variation with integration level. Thus, both
   mechanisms predict heritability should decrease with an increase in
   integration level.

Comparisons using mean‐standardized CV

   Variation in heritability could be due to additive genetic or
   environmental variation (16). 16) proposed reporting coefficients of
   genetic inline image variation as an index of a trait's evolutionary
   potential (evolvability) and level of genetic variation, in addition to
   the residual variation inline image which measures the nonadditive
   genetic and environmental variation. From our literature‐compiled data
   we collected reported CVs, or calculated CV[A] and CV[R] when
   heritability, phenotypic variance, or standard deviation, and the trait
   means traits were reported. Based on the literature, we expect that:
   CV[A] will have a positive relationship with heritability; CV[R] will
   have a negative relationship with heritability; and that CV[A] and
   CV[R]will covary positively. We used mean‐standardized CV (CV[A],
   CV[R]) as the dependent variable with the classification factors
   described above, to test the expected effects of selection and
   structure.

Scale effects

   29) point out that comparing the additive variance of life history and
   morphologial traits may be misleading because they are measured in
   different phenotypic units. Within a phenotype category such as
   behaviour, this problem is less important. Furthermore the data (h^2,
   CV[A], CV[R]) are all on a ratio scale and are independent of the unit
   of measurement. However, error measurements (33), mathematical
   constraints (20) and proportional relationships between mean and
   variance on an arithmetic scale may each generate apparent differences
   in coefficients of variation (8), rather than the biological processes
   such as selection or variance compounding (1; 16). If error
   measurements do not scale to character size, there will be a negative
   relationship between means and variances (33). A mathematical
   constraint may also cause a negative correlation between component and
   composite coefficients of variation (20). 8) points out that if
   coefficients of variation are similar on an arithmetic scale, then a
   log transformation or a scale change would eliminate scale‐related
   differences in variance. Thus a log transformation may stabilize the
   residual variation and strengthen the statistical relationship (8; 1),
   but it also provides a convenient test for scaling effects.

Results

Phenotype heritability distributions and differences in central tendency

   Central tendency of behavioural heritability in our data set
   (0.31 ± SE=0.013, median=0.23) was not significantly different
   (t[581]=0.37, P=n.s.: median test χ[1]^2=0.35, P=n.s.) from 32) and 26)
   data (x=0.30 ± 0.023, median=0.25), so we combined the data sets. The
   combined data set was positively skewed [mean=0.31 ± 95% confidence
   limits (CL)=0.02, median=0.23]. Eleven heritability estimates (1.9%)
   were larger than 1.0, six were smaller than 0 (1%) and the
   interquartile range was between 0.09 and 0.45 (Fig. 1).

   Frequency distributions for behavioural traits in the upper panel (a),
   life history traits in the middle panel (b), and morphological traits
   in the panel at the bottom (c). The inset in panel (a) indicates the
   proportions of domestic (dark bar) and wild (light bar) in each
   heritability interval. Behavioural heritability estimates that are
   either less than zero or greater than 1 are indicated by the light bars
   at the distribution extremes.

   Central tendency of the behavioural heritability distribution was
   similar to central tendency of the life history distribution (Fig. 1).
   A one‐way ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences
   (F[2,1527]=72.0, P < 0.0001) between average behavioural, life history
   and morphological heritabilities. A post hoc Tukey–Kramer HSD indicated
   average life history (0.26 ± 95% CL=0.024) and behavioural
   heritabilities differed significantly from average morphological
   heritability. But neither the Tukey test nor a median test
   (χ[1]^2=0.26, P=n.s.) indicated that the difference in central tendency
   between behavioural and life history heritabilities was significant.

Variation reported

   26) noted that standard errors (SE) are frequently not reported. 16)
   recommended routine reporting of CV[A] and CV[R], or at least the data
   required to estimate them. Between 1988 and 2000, 75% of the studies
   (59/79) have reported SEs or CLs associated with heritability
   estimates. But only 227 of the 428 (53%) estimates which we collected
   in addition to 26) and Roff and Mousseau's 154 estimates had associated
   SEs or CLs. Between 1993 and 2000, 29.4% studies (20/68) reported CVs
   or both the mean and variance of the traits analysed. However, we could
   obtain CV[A] for 22% of the estimates in these studies (67/304) and
   CV[R] for only 18% (54/304).

Relationships between CV[R], CV[A] and heritability

   Average CV[A] (22.83 ± SE=4.14) was smaller than the average CV[R]
   estimate (43.7 ± 7.37). The log[10]‐transformed variables were
   positively related (log CV[R]=0.73 + 0.63 log CV[A], r^2=0.49,
   P < 0.0001). Thus, although CV[R] is larger on average than CV[A], the
   slope indicates CV[R] does not generally increase disproportionally
   faster than CV[A].

   Both CV[A] and CV[R] affect heritability in the expected directions,
   although their coefficients were not very different in magnitude. The
   multiple regression with heritability as the dependent variable on
   log CV[A] and log CV[R] was highly significant (F[3,52]=94.8,
   P < 0.0001, R^2=0.85), although the interaction term was not
   significant (t=–0.58, d.f.=1, 52, P=0.56). We removed the interaction
   term and recalculated the regression, but neither the significance of
   the relationship nor the coefficient of determination changed. Both
   regression coefficients were highly significant, although CV[A] was
   positive (t=19.0, d.f.=1, 53, P < 0.0001, CV[A]=0.61) whereas CV[R] was
   negative (t=–17.9, d.f.=1, 53, P=0.0001, CV[R]=–0.64).

   A simple path analysis indicates that log CV[A] and log CV[R] do not
   have independent effects on heritability (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the
   direct effects of log CV[A] and log CV[R], indicated by the
   standardized partial regression coefficients (Fig. 2b), can be compared
   because they are on the same scale. First, their magnitudes are similar
   enough that they do not provide compelling evidence of a
   disproportionate effect of either log CV[A] or log CV[R]. Furthermore
   the correlation between log CV[A] and log CV[R] is highly significant
   and it has a critical statistical effect of reducing the variance
   explained by both log CV[A] and log CV[R], as both partials are larger
   than 1 (Fig. 2b). Only a causal model that includes the addition of an
   intercorrelated path between log CV[A] and log CV[R] (correlated
   effects model) is consistent with these observations (Fig. 2a). This
   result indicates that a disproportionate, independent effect of
   log CV[R] (or log CV[A]) on behavioural heritability is not a
   sufficient explanation of their causal relationships (21).

   CV[R]and CV[A] are assumed to govern variability in h^2 (21). In this
   case, the partial regression coefficients (p[hR], p[hA]) should equal
   their correlation coefficients (r[hA], r[hR]) and one or both of their
   squared values (coefficients of determination) should largely explain
   the nonresidual variance (r[hA]^2 + r[h][R]^2=1.0 – r^2[residual]). In
   the intercorrelated causes model (b), the common causes of h^2 are
   correlated (r[AR]), so the effects of CV[R] and CV[A] on heritability
   are through their direct effects measured by the standardized partial
   regression coefficients (p[hR], p[hA]) and their intercorrelated effect
   [i.e. r[hR]=p[hR] + p[hA] × r[AR]; variance explained=r^2[residual] +
   p[hR]^2 + p[hA]^2 + 2(p[hR] × r[AR] × p[hA])=1.0].

Cross‐classification of heritabilities

   All of the behavioural heritabilities were cross‐classified into
   categories related to selection or structure. Therefore we used a fully
   factorial ANOVA with heritability as the dependent variable to test for
   significant effects of differences in: (1) two estimation method
   categories, (2) wild/domestic categories, (3) three levels of
   integration and (4) seven behavioural ecology categories. With the full
   seven behavioural ecology categories, we could not estimate the three
   and four way interactions. However, heritabilities of the seven
   behaviour ecology categories did not differ significantly (one‐way
   ANOVA: F[6,574]=1.6, P=n.s.). Consequently, we collapsed the seven
   behavioural ecology categories into two metacategories: first,
   categories presumed to have consistent, directional fitness
   relationships (foraging, predator avoidance, reproduction); and second,
   categories more loosely related to fitness (social, temperament,
   movement and other). We repeated the analysis using the fully factorial
   model with the two metacategories. The four‐way interaction was not
   significant. The three‐way interaction between level of analysis,
   estimation method and wild/domestic categories was significant, in
   addition to the estimation method main effect. We removed the
   nonsignificant four‐way interaction and repeated the analysis, which
   produced the same result (three‐way interaction (level of
   analysis × estimation method × wild/domestic): F[2,554]=5.4, P < 0.01;
   estimation method: F[1,554]=12.4, P < 0.001). All the other effects had
   probability values greater than 0.16. To illustrate determinants of
   this three‐way interaction, we plotted average values governing the
   three, two‐way combinations (Figs 3 and 4).

   Average heritability of different estimation methods (with or without

   domestic‐wild categories in the lower diagram (b). In diagram (a), +NA
   indicates heritability estimates that include dominance (square
   symbols), whereas the round symbols indicate estimates that do not
   include dominance. In diagram b, the square symbol indicates domestic
   categories and the round indicates wild categories. In both diagrams,
   average heritability of the different classes is estimated at three
   levels of integration (low, medium and high). The bars indicate 1 SE
   and sample sizes for each estimation method/wild‐domestic category are
   in brackets.

   Average heritability estimates of wild/domestic categories grouped by
   estimation method indicate dominance effects are larger in domestic
   (and semidomestic species) than in nondomestic (wild) species (Fig. 3).
   This observation is consistent with the idea that directional selection
   related to domestication reduces additive genetic variation. The
   distribution of wild and domestic species did not affect central
   tendency of h^2, for both categories had a similar distribution across
   the range of heritability values (Fig. 1 inset). The difference between
   estimation method categories in wild (nondomestic) species was not
   significant (t[295]=1.24, P=n.s.). 32) and 26) reported similar
   observations. Finally, our estimate of semidomestic average
   heritability that does not include dominance variance components (0.17)
   was significantly smaller than additive estimates for domestic and wild
   species (Fig. 3). But, the semidomestic estimate was similar to average
   heritabilities (0.18) reported by 32) and 14) for Drosophila behaviour.

   Average heritabilities of estimation method categories (Fig. 4a) or
   wild/domestic classes (Fig. 4b) did not differ significantly at the
   high integration level, but did at lower integration levels. In
   particular, dominance effects in the numerator significantly biased
   estimation methods upwards at low and medium levels of integration, but
   not at the high integration level (Fig. 4a). This did not appear to be
   because of different proportions of wild and domestic species
   (Fig. 4b). If selection is stronger on highly integrated traits, or
   residual variation is disproportionately high compared with additive
   variation in highly integrated characters, then there should be
   divergence in these category averages across integration levels. But,
   they converged (Fig. 4a). If these effects of selection and structure
   are stronger at higher integration levels, then we would also expect a
   decline in average heritabilities across integration level. Neither
   plot indicated there was a decrease in heritability at a higher
   integration level (Fig. 4a,b). In summary, neither the expected
   differences related to selection nor variance compounding was observed
   at the highest integration level, although the dominance‐related
   differences at lower integration levels indicates the effects of
   directional selection (22; 4).

Selection, structure and CV

   There was less data available for testing hypotheses involving CV[A]
   and CV[R], so we restricted out statistical analysis to a median test
   and one‐way Welch ANOVA analyses because of heterogeneous variances
   (6).

   We first compared CV[A] between wild and domestic species (no CVs were
   available for semidomestic species) and found differences between
   categories in both CV[A] and CV[R]. Assuming selection reduces additive
   genetic variation and selection is stronger in domestic species, CV[A]
   should be lower on average in the domestic category compared with the
   wild category. CV[A] of domestic species was lower (CV[A]:
   domestic=14.72 ± 4.9, n=30; wild=23.23 ± 2.5, n=40), and a median test
   indicated this difference was highly significant (χ[1]^2=14.720;
   P < 0.0001). A t‐test provided a marginal result (t[68]=2.777, P=0.10),
   unless one extreme outlier was removed (CV[A] domestic=10.34 ± 2.2:
   t[67]=3.69, P < 0.001). At the same time, average CV[R] of domestic
   species (30.8 ± 6.4, n=23) was also significantly lower (t[54]=–2.9,
   P < 0.01; median test, χ[1]^2=8.8, P < 0.01) than wild CV[R]
   (58.1 ± 6.4, n=33). In other words, the difference between CV[R] of
   domestic and wild species changes in the same direction as the CV[A],
   but in this case, lower residual variation characterizes traits which
   appear to be under stronger selection.

Behaviour ecology categories

   Differences in CV[A] and CV[R] among behavioural ecology categories
   were marginally significant (CV[A]; Welch ANOVAF[6,9.2]=6.5, P < 0.01;
   median test χ[6]^2=17.9; P < 0.01; CV[R]; Welch ANOVAF[6,7]=4.14,
   P < 0.05; median test χ[6]^2=15.31; P < 0.05). CV[A] and CV[R] of life
   history‐related traits (reproductive, foraging, antipredator) were
   higher than the grand average whereas CV[A] and CV[R] of the other
   traits (social, movement, temperament, other) were lower than the grand
   mean (Table 2). The slope of the regression of log[10] CV[R] on
   log[10] CV[A] across these seven categories was less than 1
   (log CV[R]=0.75 + 0.70 × log CV[A], r^2=0.71, P < 0.05, 95%
   CL=0.18–1.22), indicating CV[R] did not increase disproportionately.

   heritability, CV[A], and CV[R] estimates classified as behaviour
   ecology or estimation method. image

Integration level

   Both CV[A] and CV[R] increased from low to high integration level
   (Fig. 5). These results support 13) argument that structural
   differences classified by integration level are associated with
   differences in additive genetic variation and 31) suggestion that these
   sources of variation covary (CV[A]; Welch ANOVAF[2,34.9]=11.49,
   P < 0.0001; median test χ[1]^2=14.768; P < 0.001; CV[R]; Welch
   ANOVAF[2,21]=22.3, P < 0.0001; median test χ[1]^2=9.2; P < 0.01). In
   particular, the slope of their relationship suggests the increase in
   CV[R] is greater on average than CV[A] (log CV[R]=– 0.33 × 1.6 log CVA,
   r^2=0.99, P < 0.05, Fig. 5), consistent with variance compounding
   hypotheses.

   Regression of CV[R] on CV[A] across low, medium and high integration
   levels. The regression coefficient is significant, positive and greater
   than one (CV[R]=–18.9 × 4.01 CV[A], F[1,1]=1405.6, P=0.01, r^2=0.99;
   log CV[R]=–0.33 + 1.6 × CV[A], r^2=0.99, P=0.04) It is also the same as
   a geometric mean regression (30), which takes variation in both axes
   into account. The horizontal and vertical bars indicate 1 SE, and error
   bars may be smaller than the symbol.

Scale, means and variation

   Because of the small number of studies reporting CV[A], CV[R] and
   particularly means (x), we used a data set that included behavioural,
   life history and morphological character parameters (n=191) to test
   whether in general, a log transformation equilibrates residual
   variation of relationships between V[A] and character means. In
   addition, log‐transformed values of V[A] and x can be organized into a
   linear model, wherein the slope coefficient
   (log V[A]=intercept + coefficient × log x) tests whether additive
   genetic variance is proportional to the mean or its square. Character
   means V[R] and V[A] are positively and significantly related on both
   the arithmetic and log scale, however, in the log[10] transformed
   relationships, both residual and additive genetic variation have closer
   relationships with character averages (V[R]=–109.7 + 6.02 × x,
   r^2=0.34, F[1,186]=97.5, P < 0.0001; log V[R]=1.82 + 1.87 × log x,
   r^2=0.71, F[1,184]=451.3, P < 0.0001; V[A]=–634.8 + 16.99 × x,
   r^2=0.31, F[1,187]=84.19, P ≤ 0.0001; log V[A]=2.25 + 1.83 × log x,
   r^2=0.80, F[1,187]=693.9, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the slope
   coefficient on the log scale indicates both variance components are
   approximately proportional to the square of their mean.

   On an arithmetic scale, average CV[A] and CV[R] differed significantly
   between integration levels (CV[A]: Welch ANOVAF[2,35]=11.27, P < 0.001;
   CV[R]: F[2, 19.4]=22.6, P < 0.0001), indicating that differences
   between these categories are not entirely because of proportionality of
   their means and variances (8). CV[A] and CV[R] were positively
   correlated across behavioural ecology categories and integration
   levels. This suggests that neither measurement error (33) nor
   component/composite correlations (20) can account for differences
   within these categories.

Discussion

   There may not be a general expectation about the average relationship
   between behaviour and fitness (16), although behavioural ecologists
   often assume many foraging and reproductive behaviours are closely
   related to fitness. In general, this assumption appears justified, for
   average (or median) behavioural heritability is similar to average life
   history heritability. At the same time, this indicates mechanisms
   causing (low) heritabilities of behaviour pose much the same problem as
   low life history heritabilities (29; 16, 17; 31; 23). Low
   heritabilities could be caused by an erosion of additive genetic
   variation, by selection (elimination‐selection hypothesis) or, by a
   disproportionate increase in residual variation (disproportionate
   variance compounding hypothesis: 29; 16, 17; 24). Both hypotheses
   predict that each mechanism should lower heritability and each
   hypothesis assumes its effect on heritability is independent.
   Directional differences in both CV[A] and heritability indicated
   elimination‐selection had a detectable effect on heritability, but
   there was also a disproportionate increase in CV[R] with integration
   level. However, heritability did not differ between behavioural
   categories thought to be more or less closely related to fitness, nor
   was it low at the highest integration level. These results suggest that
   the nature of a behavioural character predisposes it to differences in
   elimination selection and its structure governs how it integrates
   variation, but selection, structure and their interaction appear to
   determine variation in heritability.

Evidence of selection

   Relatively high dominance variation suggests directional selection on
   behaviour may be common in domestic and semidomestic environments, but
   not in wild populations. We can estimate the relative contributions of
   dominance and additive variance using dominance variance standardized
   by the sum of dominance and additive variance D[α]
   [D[α]=V[d]/(V[d] + V[a]), 4]. Our estimates for semidomestic (0.58) and
   domestic (0.55) species were both not significantly different from the
   life history estimate reported by 4). This suggests behavioural traits
   in these categories are under directional selection that is as strong
   as selection on life history traits. At the same time, our estimate of
   D[α] for behaviour of wild populations (0.23) is much smaller, although
   it is not significantly different from 4) estimate for the same
   category. The relatively low proportion of dominance variance in wild
   or nondomestic populations means that heritability estimates are not
   significantly biased by the estimation method. In other words, full sib
   breeding designs could be used for estimating additive genetic
   variation of wild population behaviour. Dominance variance of domestic
   and semidomestic populations was high and CV[A] of both categories was
   smaller than wild species. Finally, there was a concomitant difference
   in CV[R], which in this case is not related to variance compounding
   effects of structure (e.g. 16, 17; 27; 18; 19; 24). These results
   indicate that additive genetic variation of behavioural characters of
   animals under domestication is generally being eroded by directional
   selection and that there may be related changes in residual variation.

Variance compounding effects of structure

   Both low CV[A] and low heritabilities of behaviour in semidomestic
   species suggest that elimination‐selection may regulate (in part)
   behavioural heritabilities by reducing the size of additive genetic
   variation in the numerator. At the same time, low heritabilities have
   generally been explained by their large residual variance measured by
   CV[R] (= CV[P] – CV[A]) in the denominator (16; 27; 24; but see 19).
   24) point out that if large residual variation governs low heritability
   estimates, then the difference in residual variation between life
   history and morphological traits should be disproportionately larger
   than the corresponding difference in additive genetic variation. They
   report a disproportionate increase in CV[R] in an extensive data set on
   the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). They also note that
   CV[A]and CV[R] are positively and strongly correlated in both males and
   females, but argue this covariation does not influence the
   disproportionate increase in CV[R]. In other words, they hypothesize
   that CV[R] and CV[A] are independent causes of variation in
   heritability. We used their published results to construct a causal
   analysis of relationships between these three variables (CV[A], CV[R],
   h^2). First we note that their partial regression coefficient of CV[R]
   on h^2 is larger than one. On one hand, this result is consistent with
   their argument of a disproportionately strong effect of residual
   phenotypic variation on heritability. But, on the other hand, this
   result is inconsistent with an independent effects model (Fig. 2),
   because there must be an intercorrelated (complementary variable) which
   diminishes the variance of h^2, to at least the complement of the
   unexplained error variation (21). Second, we found that intercorrelated
   or indirect effects of both CV[A] and CV[R] had to be included in their
   causal analysis, similar to our analysis of relationships between CV[A]
   and CV[R] and behavioural heritability (Fig. ). But, what is the nature
   of these intercorrelated effects?

   Our results indicate a distinction should be made between the effects
   of selection or structure on phenotypic variance components and
   mechanisms governing relationships between them. The evidence for
   effects of selection was discussed above. CV[R] of behavioural trait
   categories was larger than corresponding CV[A] regardless of how they
   were classified, similar to studies cited above on morphology, life
   history and sexually selected characters. At the same time, both CV[A]
   and CV[R] increased across these categories. We proposed that if the
   slope of the relationship of log CV[R] on log CV[A] is greater than
   one, then there is evidence for a disproportionate increase in CV[R].
   CV[R] does increase disproportionately faster than CV[A] across
   different integration levels, indicating the importance of structure.
   This observation also suggests 29) model should apply to variation
   between behavioural categories, in addition to differences between life
   history and morpholological phenotypes (24). But, we did not see
   different heritabilities in behavioural ecology categories that had
   significantly different CV[A] and CV[R] (Table 2), nor was lower
   heritability observed at the highest integration level (Fig. 5). In
   addition, both the path analysis and the interactions between factors
   related to selection and structure indicate the intuitive relationship
   between h^2, CV[R] and CV[A] was not solely governed by direct effects
   of selection or structure as assumed in independent effects models. We
   suggest the intercorrelated effect, which appears to have its strongest
   influence at the highest integration level, is related to the influence
   of mechanisms causing phenotypic plasticity. However, different
   measurement scales, transformations, mathematical constraints, scaling
   of errors, arbitrary categories, or sampling effects are thought to
   cause or confound the interpretation of similar relationships.

Scale effects

   Our estimates of behavioural heritabilities in domestic, semidomestic
   and wild (nondomestic) species are very similar to those reported in
   other, independently organized studies. Furthermore, the magnitude of
   variation in CV[A] and CV[R] across behavioural ecology classes
   (Table 1) or integration levels (Fig. 5) is similar to variation
   reported across life history and morphology categories (e.g. 16; 19;
   24). At the same time, scaling effects strictly due to various
   phenotypic measurement scales (29), must be less of a problem within a
   phenotype category (i.e. behaviour). Heritabilities are scale invariant
   (1). But, 31) suggests comparisons of CV[A] and CV[R] may involve
   differences related to a scale transformation between these variance
   components. Thus, one problem is determining a scale where means and
   variances of CV[A] and CV[R] have similar, proportional relationships.
   We found log‐transformed means and variances had similar relationships
   in both coefficients (CV[A] and CV[R]). In addition, the
   log‐transformed relationships between CV[A] and CV[R] were positive,
   indicating on one hand that their relationship across behavioural
   ecology categories was not caused by measurement errors (33) and on the
   other that part – whole correlations (20) cannot explain the
   relationship across integration levels. It could also be argued that
   our categories are arbitrary with respect to fitness or structure. This
   cannot be discounted in principal, and within each category we
   acknowledge the problems with assigning behavioural characters to
   ordinal categories. However, we observed that CV[R] was higher than
   CV[A] in each category class and we found differences in CV[A] between
   behavioural ecology classes which are commonly thought to differ in
   both their structure and their relationship with fitness (13). Similar
   results have been reported in studies on differences between morphology
   and life history (16; 19; 24). At the same time, the sample population
   of studies reporting coefficients of variation is small relative to the
   heritability sample population. To this we can only reinforce 16)
   appeal that these statistics be routinely reported.

Selection, structure and genotype by environment interactions

   How does the nature of a behavioural trait determine it's heritability?
   Behavioural character heritabilities differ with respect to effects of
   selection, for which we found more evidence in characters considered to
   be less closely related to fitness and less affected by variance
   compounding. Similar to 27) study which showed that sexually selected
   morphological traits had a different structure than other morphological
   traits, behavioural character categories that differ in structure have
   different CV[A] and CV[R]. Life history traits such as fecundity
   genetically integrate (3) both morphological and physiological
   characters within a single life stage (e.g. 34). This is also the case
   for complex behavioural characters (13). On one hand, both CV[A] and
   heritability are standardized measures of additive genetic variation
   (16), but on the other hand, nonsignificant correlations between CV[A]
   and heritability suggest they are not surrogate measures of genetic
   variation (16; 27). Furthermore, CV[R] is typically larger than CV[A]
   (23), implying that compounded environmental variation governs
   differences in heritability (2; 29). However, our study shows that
   CV[A]and heritability are positively related in behavioural characters,
   and disproportionate variance compounding does not generally explain
   variation in behavioural heritabilities. Our analysis points to the
   importance of relationships between additive genetic and nonadditive
   genetic residual variation. Although additive genetic variation is a
   distinct variance component, residual variation comprises dominance,
   genotype by environment interactions, epistatic and other nonadditive
   genetic variation, in addition to environmental variation. 23) point
   out that dominance variance is an important variance component in
   selection studies and that the magnitude of this component would
   negatively covary with additive genetic variation. But, this does not
   explain our observation that average heritability of category classes
   with different dominance variation converged at the highest integration
   level and that CV[A] and CV[R] are positively related. Alternatively,
   highly integrated behaviours such as foraging, mate choice and predator
   avoidance are characterized by conditional strategies or phenotypically
   plastic responses to environmental cues. Genetic variation for
   phenotypic plasticity may be because of both additive genetic variance
   and genotype by environment interaction variance. In this light,
   heritability may be viewed not as a misleading standardized index of
   additive genetic variation, but as a statistic which integrates effects
   of selection, structure and the interrelationships between variance
   components, all of which may contribute to the genetic architecture of
   different quantitative characters.

Abstract

   Gallbladder cancer is a common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract
   that shows wide geographical variation in its distribution. Cause of
   gallbladder cancer is still obscure; however, various etiological
   factors have been proposed. Of these gallstones and inflammation of the
   gallbladder is commonest. Despite three decades of active research no
   conclusive evidence is available as to what causes gallbladder cancer?
   In this article we reviewed the evidence on the role of environmental
   pollutants on gallbladder carcinogenesis. A detailed search of Medline
   was carried out which revealed only 12 articles. A number of heavy
   metals like nickel, cadmium, etc. have been implicated; however, the
   evidence is not robust enough to conclude its association. Role of
   radiation and pesticides in river water have also been evaluated
   without any conclusive evidence of its association with gallbladder
   cancer. Better designed case‐control studies or cohort studies looking
   at exposure are required before it could be accepted as one of the
   causes of GBC. J. Surg. Oncol. 2006;93:640–643. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Abstract

   To evaluate prospectively the association between serological markers
   of selected infections, including HPV, and risk of developing cervical
   cancer (CC) and precancer, we performed a nested case–control study
   within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
   (EPIC) study that included 184 cases of invasive CC (ICC), 425 cases of
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or carcinoma in situ
   (CIS), and 1,218 matched control women. At enrollment participants
   completed lifestyle questionnaires and provided sera. Subjects were
   followed‐up for a median of 9 years. Immunoassays were used to detect
   serum antibodies to Human Herpes Virus 2 (HHV‐2), Chlamydia trachomatis
   (CT), Chlamydia pneumoniae, L1 proteins of mucosal and cutaneous HPV
   types, E6/E7 proteins of HPV16/18, as well as to four polyomaviruses.
   Adjusted odds ratios (OR) [and 95% confidence intervals (CI)] for
   CIN3/CIS and ICC risk were respectively: 1.6 (1.2–2.0) and 1.8
   (1.1–2.7) for L1 seropositivity to any mucosal HPV type, 1.0 (0.4–2.4)
   and 7.4 (2.8–19.7) for E6 seropositivity to HPV16/18, 1.3 (0.9–1.9) and
   2.3 (1.3–4.1) for CT seropositivity, and 1.4 (1.0–2.0) and 1.5
   (0.9–2.6) for HHV‐2 seropositivity. The highest OR for ICC was observed
   for HPV16 E6 seropositivity [OR = 10.2 (3.3–31.1)]. Increasing number
   of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was associated with
   increasing risk. Non‐STIs were not associated with CC risk. In
   conclusion, this large prospective study confirms the important role of
   HPV and a possible contribution of CT and HHV‐2 in cervical
   carcinogenesis. It further identifies HPV16 E6 seropositivity as the
   strongest marker to predict ICC well before disease development.

Abstract

   Airline pilots and flight engineers are exposed to ionizing radiation
   of cosmic origin and other occupational and life‐style factors that may
   influence their health status and mortality. In a cohort study in 9
   European countries we studied the mortality of this occupational group.
   Cockpit crew cohorts were identified and followed‐up in Denmark,
   Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway and
   Sweden, including a total of 28,000 persons. Observed and expected
   deaths for the period 1960–97 were compared based on national mortality
   rates. The influence of period and duration of employment was analyzed
   in stratified and Poisson regression analyses. The study comprised
   547,564 person‐years at risk, and 2,244 deaths were recorded in male
   cockpit crew (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 0.64, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 0.61–0.67). Overall cancer mortality was decreased (SMR
   = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.63–0.74). We found an increased mortality from
   malignant melanoma (SMR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15–2.67) and a reduced
   mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.44–0.62). No
   consistent association between employment period or duration and cancer
   mortality was observed. A low cardiovascular mortality and an increased
   mortality caused by aviation accidents were noted. Our study shows that
   cockpit crew have a low overall mortality. The results are consistent
   with previous reports of an increased risk of malignant melanoma in
   airline pilots. Occupational risk factors apart from aircraft accidents
   seem to be of limited influence with regard to the mortality of cockpit
   crew in Europe. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

   Airline pilots and flight engineers are occupationally exposed to
   ionizing radiation of cosmic origin and to electromagnetic fields from
   cockpit instruments.1 Contact with jet fuel and inhalation of fumes2, 3
   could also pose occupational hazards. Whether chronobiological
   disturbances caused by frequent crossing of time zones have any
   long‐term health effects is currently unclear.

   Among other things, the potential hazards of ionizing radiation have
   motivated research focussing on exposure quantification and health
   consequences, in particular as no human data concerning health effects
   of neutrons are available. Cosmic radiation originates from high‐energy
   particles with sources in and outside the solar system. Interactions
   with the atmosphere lead to the creation of neutrons that contribute up
   to 60% to the effective radiation dose.4 Highest radiation doses occur
   in jet flights in high altitude and on polar routes. In‐flight
   measurement approaches5, 6 and dose calculations7 yield rather similar
   results indicating that typical cockpit crew are exposed to annual
   radiation doses in the range 2–6 mSv.

   Epidemiologic cohort studies of cancer incidence and mortality among
   civil aviation cockpit crew have been conducted in North America,8, 9,
   10 Japan11 and European countries.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
   Increased risks for malignant melanoma of the skin have been the most
   consistent finding to date. Risk increases for cancers of the brain,
   large bowel, and prostate as well as for leukemia were found in some
   studies, but not in all. Typical findings have included a high risk of
   aviation accidents and decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes.

   Most studies reported so far have been relatively small. Opportunities
   to evaluate dose‐response analyses with e.g., duration of employment or
   other exposure indices have been limited. To address these issues, a
   collaborative European mortality study among flight personnel was set
   up. The primary aim was to assess the mortality of flight crew in
   relation to occupational factors, with a focus on potential effects of
   ionizing radiation. This is a report on the mortality of cockpit crew,
   i.e., pilots and flight engineers, from 9 European countries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

   The European Study of Cancer Risks among Airline Personnel (ESCAPE) is
   a collaborative European investigation in which cockpit crew cohorts
   were collected in nine countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great
   Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Sweden) according to a joint
   protocol and subsequently analyzed together. The national cohorts of
   cockpit crew were compiled from varying sources in the participating
   countries (Table I). Procedures have been described previously in more
   detail for most cohorts.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 In short, cockpit
   crew were identified from airline personnel files in Finland, Germany,
   Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy and Sweden, supplemented by data
   from airline pilot associations in Finland and Iceland. Pension records
   were used in Great Britain. In Norway, license data of the national
   aviation authority were used for cohort identification and enumeration;
   this source was also used in Iceland. In Denmark, all commercial
   cockpit crew on file in the National Clinic of Aviation Medicine in
   Copenhagen were included.

   The data collected for each individual included name, gender, date of
   birth and employment or license data. Wherever possible, information on
   detailed occupational history was recorded. For each cohort member,
   start of employment and, if retired, end of service as crew member were
   available. In several cohorts further employment data such as aircraft
   type and flight hours were collected and radiation exposure was
   estimated.21, 22, 23 These data were not used in the current analysis
   of the complete cohort as they are still incomplete.

   Follow‐up for the vital status of each individual started at the first
   date of employment or licensing, at immigration, or the
   country‐specific start of follow‐up, whichever was latest, and ended at
   date of death, date of loss to follow‐up, emigration or at the end of
   the study period (end of 1996 or 1997, depending on country) whichever
   came first.

   Follow‐up was carried out through centralized or local population
   registries in most countries. In Denmark, Finland, Great Britain,
   Iceland, Italy, Norway and Sweden causes of deaths were established
   through record linkage with national death registries. In the Nordic
   countries, the unique personal identifier of all cohort members was
   recorded and the linkage done electronically. In Greece social security
   records were used to establish vital status; these records also
   contained the cause of death for deceased cohort members. Follow‐up for
   vital status in Germany was done through population registries and
   local health offices provided copies of death certificates. Information
   from physicians or relatives was retrieved when the death certificate
   was not accessible. All deaths were coded according to the relevant
   revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD
   revisions 7‐10). Data were analyzed centrally at the University of
   Bielefeld, Germany. Cohort members for whom date of birth or date of
   beginning of employment/license were missing were excluded from the
   analysis. Data for female cockpit crew were not analyzed as the cohort
   and the number of deaths were small.

Statistical analysis

   Expected numbers of deaths were computed using cause‐specific
   population mortality rates for each country from the WHO mortality data
   base or supplied by the national statistical offices. The period
   1960–97 was used as time window for the analysis. Person‐years at risk
   and mortality rates were calculated in 5‐year age and calendar
   intervals, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated.24
   Because the cause of death was unknown for some persons, a correction
   method proposed recently was applied that allows an improved estimation
   of the SMR in the presence of missing causes of deaths.25 For this
   correction, the observed number of cases is divided by a correction
   factor equation image that represents the proportion of persons with
   known cause of death among all deaths (0 ≤ equation image ≤ 1), thus
   increasing slightly the observed numbers. Appropriately corrected26 95%
   confidence intervals (CI) for the SMR were calculated based on an
   approximation or on exact Poisson distribution. Heterogeneity was
   investigated by χ^2 tests24 and by plotting country‐specific SMR
   results. In addition an analysis of mortality stratified by time since
   first employment for mortality from main causes and
   radiation‐associated cancers was conducted. In a Poisson regression
   analysis the effect of duration of employment/license adjusted for age
   (using 5‐year age groups) and calendar period (categories 1960–69,
   1970–79, 1980–89, 1990–97) was assessed. Further adjustment for country
   did not change risk estimates, but led to model convergence problems in
   several instances.

RESULTS

   An overall cohort of 28,066 male cockpit crew and 262 female cockpit
   crew members was compiled. In total, 279 cohort members had to be
   excluded from the analysis since date of birth, sex or date of first
   employment were unknown. The 27,797 male cockpit crew members finally
   included in the study yielded 547,564 person‐years. Of the total
   cohort, 5.3% emigrated or were otherwise lost to follow‐up.

   Among male cockpit crew, a total of 2,244 deaths (Table II) were
   recorded between 1960–97, yielding an SMR of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.61–0.67).
   Overall cancer mortality was also lower than in the general population
   (SMR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.63–0.74). Mortality from malignant melanoma was
   increased significantly (SMR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15‐2.67), and lung
   cancer mortality was very low (SMR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.44–0.62). For
   most other cancers, the mortality of cockpit crew was slightly lower
   than in the general population, although the SMR differences were not
   significant statistically. Thirty pilots died from leukemia, suggesting
   no excess risk (SMR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.69–1.50). The results were
   similar for leukemia excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia (non‐CLL
   leukemia; SMR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.67–1.70). There were 41 brain cancer
   deaths yielding an SMR of 1.20 (95% CI = 0.87–1.67). Among rare cancer
   types not listed in Table II, 3 cases of cancer of the eye were
   observed vs. about 1 case expected (SMR = 2.93, 95% CI = 0.58–8.42).

   Mortality from chronic diseases such as diabetes, respiratory diseases
   and cardiovascular causes was markedly lower than in the reference
   population (Table II). The observed number of cerebrovascular deaths
   was only half the expected (SMR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.41–0.62). More than
   10% of all recorded deaths (n = 244) among cockpit crew were due to
   aircraft accidents (SMR = 88, 95% CI = 77–101), a rare cause of death
   in the general population. Mortality from other accidents (e.g., motor
   vehicle) and other external causes was decreased significantly.

   Analyses according to time since first employment (data not shown)
   showed highest SMRs for all causes during the first 10 years after
   employment and there was no SMR increase with increasing time. For
   cardiovascular diseases a moderate mortality increase over time was
   obvious, but the mortality remained at about 50% of the population
   rates even in the highest category. The Poisson regression analysis to
   evaluate the influence of duration of employment/license as a proxy for
   occupational exposures (Table III) indicated a decreasing mortality
   with increasing employment duration for deaths from all causes (p <
   0.01), cardiovascular disease (p < 0.01), leukemia (p = 0.02) and
   aircraft accidents (p < 0.01). For non‐CLL leukemia no trend across
   duration categories was seen. The colon was the only cancer site for
   which there seemed to be an increased risk with duration of employment
   (RR = 30+ years vs. 0–10 years = 2.01; 95% CI = 0.82–4.91, p‐ = 0.06).

   Country‐specific SMR estimates showed marked differences for several
   causes of death (Table II, Fig. 1a–e). The all cause SMR was 1.43 (95%
   CI = 1.05–1.90) in Iceland whereas SMR point estimates for all other
   countries ranged below one. This difference was caused by the
   particularly high contribution of aircraft accidents to overall deaths
   in Iceland (60%).

   When aircraft accidents were excluded from the analyses, the overall
   ESCAPE‐SMR was reduced to 0.57, but some heterogeneity was still
   present, mainly due to a low overall SMR in Germany (SMR = 0.42) and a
   rather high value for Denmark (SMR = 0.80). Similar differences were
   seen for all cancers, lung cancer and all cardiovascular deaths. The
   test for heterogeneity (Table II) was not statistically significant for
   most other causes of death, but the test power was low in most
   instances. Malignant melanoma deaths were rare overall, and accordingly
   the country‐specific SMR estimates were imprecise, ranging from 0
   (Finland) to 9.1 (Iceland). There was, however, no statistical
   heterogeneity between countries.

DISCUSSION

   Potential health effects of cosmic radiation among cockpit crew have
   become a subject of concern and research recently. Along with other
   aircrew they have been classified as occupationally exposed to ionizing
   radiation since 1996,27 with typical annual exposure levels in the
   range of 2–6 mSv. This amounts to roughly twice the annual background
   radiation dose in most countries28 and is greater than the radiation
   dose that nuclear power plant workers receive. Theoretically a career
   dose of 150 mSv or more could be possible for a pilot, but detailed
   dose estimations carried out for some cohorts19, 21 have not indicated
   cumulative doses exceeding 100 mSv. Nevertheless, late effects of
   cumulative radiation exposure, most notably excess cancer incidence and
   mortality, have been of concern.

   The current study is the largest mortality study among cockpit crew
   published so far, covering more than half of all European cockpit crew
   employed and licensed in the second half of the last century.
   Consistent with studies both included12, 29 and not9 in this analysis
   and a strong healthy worker effect in cockpit crew, the all‐cause
   mortality was markedly decreased. The typical “healthy worker pattern”
   of increasing mortality with increasing time since first employment was
   not seen, however, mainly because of a high risk of death from aircraft
   accidents in the early years of employment or licensing. High social
   status and regular medical examinations may contribute to the low
   mortality. These reasons may also partly explain the observed low
   overall cancer mortality and a lower prevalence of life‐style factors,
   particularly smoking, may play an additional role. No data were
   available on smoking patterns of the overall cohort, but the markedly
   reduced mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 0.53) suggests that smoking
   has been less common among pilots and other cockpit members than in the
   general male population. In addition a cross‐sectional study among
   Canadian pilots30 confirm a very low smoking prevalence of current
   cockpit crew.

   We used the general population of the participating countries as
   reference population. A better defined and more comparable group would
   be an alternative. With regard to cockpit crew, air traffic controllers
   might be such a group, with similar educational level, salary,
   occupational health requirements and exposure to shift work. An even
   better option for the future, however, is to focus on internal
   comparisons if larger numbers of deaths will have occurred after an
   extended follow‐up period.

   Both incidence and mortality from malignant melanoma have been
   increased in previous cockpit crew studies9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20
   most of which are also included in our analysis. It is difficult to
   demonstrate an excess of melanoma in mortality studies because of the
   high survival rate for this disease. The 1.8‐fold mortality increase
   among cockpit crew in our study was based on 25 melanoma deaths, with
   high risks reported mainly from Northern European countries (except
   Finland). Occupational UV exposure is unlikely as shielding of aircraft
   windows against ultraviolet radiation is effective.31 More frequent
   leisure‐time sunlight exposure has been suggested as a probable
   explanation,12 but more information on this issue is clearly required.
   An association between ionizing radiation and incidence of melanoma
   remains under debate.32, 33, 34 Supporting a possible melanoma‐ionizing
   radiation link, slight increases of melanoma risk among radiologic
   technologists were reported recently.35 Among Nordic pilots,20 a
   positive dose‐response relationship between estimated radiation
   exposure and melanoma incidence was observed although the authors
   concluded that the excess melanoma incidence may well be attributable
   to ultraviolet radiation. Possible interactions between ionizing and
   UV‐radiation36 also require further study.

   For leukemia, previous studies reported risk estimates ranging from
   0.9–1.7 with highest disease risks among Danish jet pilots14 but the
   case numbers were small in most studies. Based on 30 deaths from
   leukemia, no differences between mortality rates of cockpit crew and
   that of the reference population were found. This finding was
   essentially unchanged when the analysis was restricted to non‐CLL
   leukemia. Consistent with earlier studies37, 38, 39 no increased risks
   of other radiation‐induced cancers were seen. A longer follow‐up of our
   cohorts and analyses using more refined exposure data are needed to
   further investigate the risk for leukemia and other
   radiation‐associated malignancies in the future.

   Increased mortality and incidence has been reported previously for
   several other malignancies among cockpit crew, including brain,
   prostate and bowel cancer. The ESCAPE study showed an overall SMR of
   1.2 for brain cancer, with a wide confidence interval. There was a
   tendency for higher risks among those with employment of more than 10
   years duration. Occupational risk factors for brain cancer have not
   been clearly identified.40 In US Air Force pilots, a weak association
   between brain cancer and electromagnetic fields has been found, but a
   much stronger association existed with socio‐economic status.41 In the
   Nordic incidence study,20 no increase of brain cancer incidence was
   observed.

   A suggestive dose‐response relationship between number of block hours
   and incidence of prostate cancer among Nordic airline pilots was
   described recently.20 Our mortality analysis showed no increases for
   prostate cancer mortality in European cockpit crew, with an overall SMR
   of 0.94 and no obvious time‐related variations in mortality.
   Differences between incidence and mortality studies could be due to an
   increased detection rate of early incident prostate cancer among
   cockpit crew. Occupational exposures (radiation, sedentary work) might
   be responsible for a small proportion of the excess risk for cancer of
   the colon associated with longer duration of employment, but other,
   e.g., dietary factors may also play a role.

   Our study confirms the marked cardiovascular mortality reduction of
   cockpit crew9, 11 as compared to the general population. Obviously only
   very healthy persons are recruited into the profession, and continuous
   medical supervision may play a role in controlling cardiovascular risk
   factors. Analyses of mortality by age show that low mortality persists
   even after retirement. As seen in ESCAPE subcohorts12, 18, 29 and
   independent studies8, 9 published previously, aircraft accidents,
   whether private or occupational cause a substantial proportion of
   deaths especially among younger cockpit crew. Pilots in early phases of
   their flight career seem to carry the highest risk of accidental death
   in aviation. Mortality from motor vehicle and other accidents was low.

   Our study has several strengths, among them the large size of the
   cohort and reliable population registration systems and mortality
   statistics in most participating countries. The cohort represents a
   highly complete sample of the source population in the participating
   countries. Where license data were used, all licensed pilots were
   included, in the other countries the largest airline companies supplied
   data. Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted with caution.
   Limitations of epidemiological studies among aircrew include the low
   statistical power due to the small expected risk increases particularly
   for radiation‐induced cancers.42 Additionally our cohort is very young.
   Despite the large number of person‐years at follow‐up, <10% of cohort
   members have died and numbers for many specific cancer sites are still
   small.

   Although cohort members across the different participating countries
   had rather similar working conditions the SMRs for several causes of
   death were significantly different between national sub‐cohorts.
   Despite the common protocol methodological discrepancies may still
   partly explain this observation. More important than the slight
   differences in cohort enumeration, differences in the quality and
   availability of reliable cause of death data could contribute to the
   heterogeneity. Differences in exposure, depending on geographical
   location and routes flown as well as differences in life‐style factors
   and in the staff selection procedure of airlines may also have
   influenced the mortality risks to a minor extent. Clearly,
   country‐specific risk differences for aircraft accidents contributed to
   the heterogeneity of the all‐cause SMR.

   No information on confounding, such as smoking and leisure‐time UV
   exposure, was available. Detailed evaluations of specific causes of
   death including information on confounders would require additional
   data collection. It seems currently that an extension of the follow up
   of the cohort to gain more power for the analyses is feasible and
   important.

   In summary, this large pooled analysis of mortality data from 9
   European countries showed a markedly decreased mortality from all
   causes as well as from cancer and cardiovascular diseases among cockpit
   crew as compared to the general population. Deaths due to aircraft
   accidents were relatively frequent among cockpit crew. Mortality from
   malignant melanoma was raised, but no clear associations with
   employment patterns emerged. Our results do not indicate a substantial
   contribution of occupational factors to the mortality from cancer and
   most other causes among cockpit crew in Europe.

Abstract

   Together with chitin, the β‐glucans are components of mycetes' cell
   walls. A high level of biological efficiency has been found in
   β‐glucans, especially β‐1,3‐D‐glucans and β‐1,6‐D‐glucans isolated from
   some basidiomycetes. (Biological efficiency refers to the relative
   ability of β‐glucans to promote a desired response, for example to
   induce leukocyte activation and to produce inflammatory mediators.)
   These polysaccharides increase the number of Th1 lymphocytes, which
   help protect organisms against allergic reactions. A number of
   β‐glucans, for example pleuran from Oyster (Pleurotus spp.) mushrooms
   or lentinan from Shiitake (Lentinus edodes) mushrooms, have shown
   marked anticarcinogenic activity. In addition to having an
   immunity‐stimulating effect, β‐glucans may participate in physiological
   processes related to the metabolism of fats in the human body. Their
   application results in a decrease in the total cholesterol content in
   blood and may also contribute to reductions in body weight.

Abstract

Objectives

   The objective of this study has been to confirm the sex and the
   affinity of an individual buried in a well‐furnished warrior grave (Bj
   581) in the Viking Age town of Birka, Sweden. Previously, based on the
   material and historical records, the male sex has been associated with
   the gender of the warrior and such was the case with Bj 581. An earlier
   osteological classification of the individual as female was considered
   controversial in a historical and archaeological context. A genomic
   confirmation of the biological sex of the individual was considered
   necessary to solve the issue.

Materials and methods

   Genome‐wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the
   biological sex, to support skeletal integrity, and to investigate the
   genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals as well
   as modern‐day groups. Additionally, a strontium isotope analysis was
   conducted to highlight the mobility of the individual.

Results

   The genomic results revealed the lack of a Y‐chromosome and thus a
   female biological sex, and the mtDNA analyses support a
   single‐individual origin of sampled elements. The genetic affinity is
   close to present‐day North Europeans, and within Sweden to the southern
   and south‐central region. Nevertheless, the Sr values are not
   conclusive as to whether she was of local or nonlocal origin.

Discussion

   The identification of a female Viking warrior provides a unique insight
   into the Viking society, social constructions, and exceptions to the
   norm in the Viking time‐period. The results call for caution against
   generalizations regarding social orders in past societies.

1 INTRODUCTION

   Already in the early middle ages, there were narratives about fierce
   female Vikings fighting alongside men. Although, continuously
   reoccurring in art as well as in poetry, the women warriors have
   generally been dismissed as mythological phenomena (Gardeła, 2013;
   Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996).

   Archaeological evidence of warrior graves is numerous, especially in
   the Viking Age of Northern Europe. Situated in Eastern Central Sweden,
   Birka was a key centre for trade during the 8th–late 10th century
   (Figure 1) (S1), linked to a social, cultural and economic network that
   reached beyond the Ural Mountains into the Caliphate in the east and
   south to the Byzantine Empire (Ambrosiani, 2012). Birka's population of
   approximately 700–1000 inhabitants consisted of trading families,
   artisans and warriors (Hedenstierna‐Jonson, 2014). The urban culture in
   Birka was different from the everyday life and practices of the
   surrounding region.

   Map showing the location of Birka and grave Bj 581

   One of the strongest features reflected through the archaeological
   remains is the extent and diversity of contacts and cultural influences
   from other places (Ambrosiani, 2012; Arbman, 1941; Hedenstierna‐Jonson,
   2014), which is also reflected in the diverse burial practice
   (Gräslund, 1980). Over 3,000 graves are known, of which approximately
   1,100 have been excavated, making it one of the largest known
   congregations of burials in the Viking world. The graves are
   distributed over large burial grounds encircling the town area.

   One warrior grave, Bj 581, stands out as exceptionally well‐furnished
   and complete (Arbman, 1941; Thålin‐Bergman, 1986) (Figure 2 and S1).
   Prominently placed on an elevated terrace between the town and a
   hillfort, the grave was in direct contact with Birka's garrison. The
   grave goods include a sword, an axe, a spear, armour‐piercing arrows, a
   battle knife, two shields, and two horses, one mare and one stallion;
   thus, the complete equipment of a professional warrior. Furthermore, a
   full set of gaming pieces indicates knowledge of tactics and strategy
   (van Hamel, 1934; Whittaker, 2006), stressing the buried individual's
   role as a high‐ranking officer. As suggested from the material and
   historical records (Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996), the male sex has been
   associated with the gender of a warrior identity. Hence, the individual
   in Bj 581 was considered a male based on the assemblage of grave goods
   (Arbman, 1941; Gräslund, 1980), and the sex was only questioned after a
   full osteological and contextual analysis (Kjellström, 2016) that
   showed that the individual was a woman (S2 and S3). The existence of
   female warriors in Viking Age Scandinavia has been debated among
   scholars (Gardeła, 2013; Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996). Though some
   Viking women buried with weapons are known, a female warrior of this
   importance has never been determined and Viking scholars have been
   reluctant to acknowledge the agency of women with weapons (Hernæs,
   1984; Moen, 2011) (S1). The osteological analysis triggered questions
   concerning sex, gender and identity among Viking warriors. This made it
   important to further investigate the biological sex and to do
   additional analyses to explore the genetic affinity of the individual
   buried in Bj 581. Here we present data including nuclear DNA and
   strontium isotopes of the individual.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Osteology

   The skeleton was represented by bone elements from all body regions
   (S2). Stored with Bj 581 was also a femur belonging to another burial
   which was excluded. The age and sex estimation results, presented at a
   conference in 2014 (Kjellström, 2016), were based on osteological
   standard methods for morphologic indicators (Buikstra & Ubelaker, 1994)
   (S2–S3). The epiphyseal union was completed on all preserved bones, and
   the appearance of the auricular surface of the left hip bone meets the
   morphologic criteria for phase 3 according to methods by Lovejoy,
   Meindl, Mensforth, and Pryzbeck (1985) and Meindl and Owen (1989).
   Furthermore, the dental wear of the lower molars was clear but moderate
   (stage 2–4) (Brothwell, 1981). In all, this suggests that the
   individual was at least above 30 years of age. The greater sciatic
   notch of the hip bone was broad, and a wide preauricular sulcus was
   present. This, together with the lack of projection of the mental
   eminence on the mandible, assessed the individual as female.
   Additionally, the long bones are thin, slender and gracile which
   provide further indirect support for the assessment. No pathological or
   traumatic injuries were observed.

2.2 Archaeological samples

   Two samples intended for DNA analyses were removed from individual Bj
   581. The samples were taken from the left canine and the left humerus;
   see Supporting Information Appendix, Section S3 for details.

2.3 DNA extraction and sequencing

   All laboratory procedures were carried out at the Archaeological
   Research Laboratory (AFL), Stockholm University. DNA was extracted
   using urea‐based extraction buffer combined with silica‐based spin
   column purification—MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), according
   to the manufactures protocols (Malmström et al., 2009; Yang, Eng, Waye,
   Dudar, & Saunders, 1998). The obtained DNA extracts were used for
   preparation of blunt‐end Illumina genomic libraries (Meyer & Kircher,
   2010). The number of amplification cycles was estimated using gel
   electrophoresis and the libraries were amplified with AmpliTaq^® Gold
   DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems™) in six separate PCR reactions. The
   amplified products were pooled, purified with Agencourt AMPure beads
   (Beckman Coulter), quantified using DNA High Sensitivity Kit with
   Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies) and shotgun
   sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms at the Science for Life
   Laboratory Sequencing Centre in Stockholm. Raw DNA data was sorted into
   individual samples based on tagged sequences (de‐multiplexed),
   quality‐controlled and delivered to UPPNEX (UPPmax NEXt Generation
   sequence Cluster & Storage) (Lampa, Dahlo, Olason, Hagberg, & Spjuth,
   2013).

2.4 Sequence analyses

   The computations were performed on resources provided by SNIC through
   Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science
   (UPPMAX) under the following projects: b2013240, b2015307, and
   b2016056. Sequence data was analyzed following previously published
   procedures (Günther et al., 2015; Omrak et al., 2016). De‐multiplexed
   sequencing pair‐end reads were merged, trimmed and then mapped to the
   human reference genomes build 36 and 37 with BWA v. 0.7.13 (Li &
   Durbin, 2010). The PCR duplicates were removed with
   FilterUniqueSAMCons.py (Kircher, 2012). Obtained DNA fragments were
   then checked for presence of 3′ and 5′ degradation patterns
   characteristic of ancient DNA (Briggs et al., 2007, Brotherton et al.,
   2007, Sawyer, Krause, Guschanski, Savolainen, & Pääbo, 2012) using
   PMDtools (Skoglund et al., 2014). Molecular sex assignment was
   estimated based on the ratio of sequences aligning to the two sex
   chromosomes, X and Y (Skoglund, Storå, Götherström, & Jakobsson, 2013)
   (Figure 3, S4). Levels of contamination were estimated based on the
   analyses of contradictory positions in mitochondrial sequences (Green
   et al., 2008). The consensus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences were
   called using samtools package (Li et al. 2009) while the initial
   haplogroup assignment was in HAPLOFIND tool (Vianello et al., 2013).
   The assignments were inspected manually by checking against
   PhyloTree–mtDNA tree build 17 (18 February 2016) (van Oven & Kayser,
   2009). For details consult Supporting Information Appendix, Section S4
   and Table S4.2.

   et al. (2012) (‡), Raghavan et al. (2014) (†). The biological sex is
   given in parenthesis

2.5 Reference population panel

   The genetic data from the Birka warrior was merged with three different
   population reference data‐sets consisting of genotype SNP data from:
   the Human Origins dataset (Patterson et al., 2012; Lazaridis et al.,
   2014), the Swedish reference (Salmela et al., 2011), and the Population
   Reference Sample–POPRES (Nelson et al., 2008) merged with 60 Yoruban
   individuals from the pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000
   Genome Project Consortium, 2010). The analyses were restricted to
   nucleotide positions with minimum mapping and base quality of 30.

2.6 Population comparisons

   The principal component analyses (PCA) was undertaken using EIGENSOFT
   v.6.0.1 (Patterson et al., 2006). The analyses were performed with
   pseudo‐haploid genomes and excluding of transition sites. To obtain
   information on genetic affinities between the Birka individual and the
   modern populations, we performed f3‐outgroup statistics using qp3Pop v.
   204 (Patterson et al., 2012) and D statistics which were calculated
   using qpDstat of ADMIXTOOLS (Durand, Patterson, Reich, & Slatkin, 2011;
   Patterson et al., 2012). The results are summarized in Figure 4 and
   Supporting Information Figure S4.2a‐b, S4.3, S4.4, Table S4.4, and
   Supplementary Excel Table.

2.7 Strontium isotope analyses

   Three molar teeth from the lower jaw of individual Bj 581 were
   submitted to Sr analyses. For comparison teeth of additional five
   individuals from Birka were also analyzed, Supporting Information
   Table S5.1. For three individuals, including the warrior woman, all
   molars (M1–M3) could be studied and for another three, only the first
   and second molars (M1–M2) were analyzed. Comparative Sr isotopic data
   in tooth enamel from ten other individuals from Birka as well as mean
   values of individuals from other parts of Eastern Middle Sweden were
   collected from earlier publications (Eriksson et al., 2016; Price,
   Frei, & Naumann, 2015). In order to relate the strontium values to
   various regions, the local bioavailable strontium isotope (^87Sr/^86Sr)
   baseline should be established as a reference for comparisons (Bentley,
   2006; Linderholm, Hedenstierna‐Jonson, Svensk, & Lidén, 2008; Slovak &
   Paytan, 2011). Unfortunately, baseline data of the Sr isotopic range in
   the Lake Mälaren Valley is not known. The bedrock in large parts of
   Eastern Middle Sweden, including Birka, belongs to the Baltic Shield
   and comprise of Precambrian crystalline (granitic) rocks but also
   younger metamorphosed rocks, such as sandstone and quartzite
   (Lindström, qvist, Lundqvist, Calner, & Sivhed, 2011). These rocks may
   be expected to have different Sr isotopic values. Available data from
   other regions in Sweden and also the comparative data of humans from
   Eastern Middle Sweden aid interpretations and are considered sufficient
   for the purpose at hand.

3 RESULTS

   Genome‐wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the
   biological sex, to support skeletal integrity and also to investigate
   the genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals and
   modern day groups (S4). We investigated two samples from grave Bj 581,
   the left canine and the left humerus, which both yielded sufficient
   amounts of DNA for further analyses (Supporting Information Table
   S4.1). The DNA was extracted following previously published procedures
   (Günther et al., 2015). The bone extract contained 0.54% endogenous
   human DNA and the tooth extract contained 3.88%. The obtained DNA
   sequences showed all the characteristics of authentic and ancient DNA
   (Briggs et al., 2007) (Supporting Information Figure S4.1a,b), with
   mitochondrial contamination estimated to 0.42% (Green et al., 2008).

   The Birka warrior was sequenced to mean 0.09× nuclear and 326.5×
   mitochondrial genome coverage. The mt‐haplogroup was assigned to T2b
   (Vianello et al., 2013). The total of 11312749 reads mapped to the
   human genome. When corrected for clonality, the number of reads mapping
   to X and Y chromosomes were 248,170 and 247, respectively, resulting in
   the proportion of the alignments (R[Y]) equal to 0.001 (SE = 0.0001).
   The cut‐off value for identification of females is R[Y] ≤ 0.016,
   showing that Bj 581 was a female (Skoglund et al., 2013) (Figure 3).
   Hence the individual in grave Bj 581 is the first confirmed female
   high‐ranking Viking warrior. Finally, we note that both biological sex
   and mtDNA analyses support the single‐individual origin of the analyzed
   cranial and postcranial remains (same sex and mt‐haplogroup T)
   (Supporting Information Table S4.3).

   The Viking warrior female showed genetic affinity to present‐day
   inhabitants of the British Islands (England and Scotland), the North
   Atlantic Islands (Iceland and the Orkneys), Scandinavia (Denmark and
   Norway) and to lesser extent Eastern Baltic Europe (Lithuania and
   Latvia) (Figure 4a,b and Supporting Information Figure S4.2a,b).
   Furthermore, the woman is significantly more similar to these modern
   northern Europeans than to southern Europeans (Supporting Information
   Table S4.5). All of those geographical locations are situated within
   the Viking World. A detailed comparison with modern‐day Swedish
   individuals from across the entire country shows genetic affinities
   between the female warrior and southern and south‐central Swedes
   (Figure 4c).

   The strontium isotope values (^87Sr/^86Sr) in three teeth (first molar
   0.71842, second molar 0.71623, and third molar 0.71687) could suggest
   mobility in her early years (between the formation age of M1 and M2)
   (S5 and Supporting Information Figure S5.1a). The Sr values fall in the
   lower range of other Birka individuals (the mean for all measurements
   in the present study is 0.7214, sd 0.0048) (Supporting Information
   Table S5.1 and Figure S5.1a). The Sr ratio falls outside of the local
   baseline, as estimated on the basis of faunal proxies (Bäckström &
   Price, 2016; Oras et al., 2016; Price et al., 2015; Price, Peets,
   Allmäe, Maldre, & Oras, 2016; Peschel, Carlsson, Bethard, & Beaudry,
   2017; Wilhelmson & Ahlström, 2015) (Supporting Information Figure S5.1b
   and S5.2). Thus, the female warrior, was probably of nonlocal origin
   and, had moved to Birka.

4 DISCUSSION

   Birka embodies the conceptions of the Viking Age as a period of long
   distance connections, trade, crafts and warfare. The archaeological
   material provides a reference for the Viking Age. At Birka, grave Bj
   581 was brought forward as an example of an elaborate high‐status male
   warrior grave. This image of the male warrior in a patriarchal society
   was reinforced by research traditions and contemporary preconceptions
   (Moen, 2011). Hence, the biological sex of the individual was taken for
   granted.

   A first osteological analysis done in the 1970ies identified the
   skeleton as a female, but this could not generate further discussion as
   the skeleton could not securely be associated to a context. When the
   sex identification and a proper contextualisation was made, and set in
   relation to the objects (Kjellström, 2016), questions were still raised
   if the martial objects in the grave mirrored the identity of the
   deceased. Similar associations of women buried with weapons have been
   dismissed, arguing that the armaments could have been heirlooms,
   carriers of symbolic meaning or grave goods reflecting the status and
   role of the family rather than the individual (Gardeła, 2013). Male
   individuals in burials with a similar material record are not
   questioned in the same way. Furthermore, an argument can be put forward
   that the grave originally may have held a second, now missing,
   individual. In which case, the weaponry could have been a part of that
   individual's grave furnishings, while the remaining female was buried
   without any objects. However, the distribution of the grave goods
   within the grave, their spatial relation to the female individual and
   the total lack of any typically female attributed grave artefacts
   disputes this possibility.

   Do weapons necessarily determine a warrior? The interpretation of grave
   goods is not straight forward, but it must be stressed that the
   interpretation should be made in a similar manner regardless of the
   biological sex of the interred individual. Furthermore, the exclusive
   grave goods and two horses are worthy of an individual with
   responsibilities concerning strategy and battle tactics. The skeletal
   remains in grave Bj 581 did not exhibit signs of antemortem or
   perimortem trauma which could support the notion that the individual
   had been a warrior. However, contrary to what could be expected, weapon
   related wounds (and trauma in general) are not common in the inhumation
   burials at Birka (e.g., 2 out of 49 confirmed males showed signs of
   sharp force trauma). A similarly low frequency is noted at
   contemporaneous cemeteries in Scandinavia (e.g., Helgesson Arcini,
   1996). Traces of violent trauma are more common in Viking Age mass
   burials (e.g., Loe, Boyle, Webb, & Score, 2014; Price et al., 2016).

   Although not possible to rule out, previous arguments have likely
   neglected intersectional perspectives where the social status of the
   individual was considered of greater importance than biological sex.
   This type of reasoning takes away the agency of the buried female. As
   long as the sex is male, the weaponry in the grave not only belong to
   the interred but also reflects his status as warrior, whereas a female
   sex has raised doubts, not only regarding her ascribed role but also in
   her association to the grave goods.

   Grave Bj 581 is one of three known examples where the individual has
   been treated in accordance with prevailing warrior ideals lacking all
   associations with the female gender (Jesch, 2009) (S1, S2, and S3).
   Furthermore, the exclusive grave goods and two horses are worthy of an
   individual with responsibilities concerning strategy and battle
   tactics. Our results caution against sweeping interpretations based on
   archaeological contexts and preconceptions. They provide a new
   understanding of the Viking society, the social constructions and also
   norms in the Viking Age. The genetic and strontium data also show that
   the female warrior was mobile, a pattern that is implied in the
   historical sources, especially when it comes to the extended households
   of the elite (cf. Steinsland, Sigurđsson, Rekdal, & Beuermann, 2011).
   The female Viking warrior was part of a society that dominated 8th to
   10th century northern Europe. Our results—that the high‐status grave Bj
   581 on Birka was the burial of a high ranking female Viking
   warrior—suggest that women, indeed, were able to be full members of
   male dominated spheres. Questions of biological sex, gender and social
   roles are complex and were so also in the Viking Age. This study shows
   how the combination of ancient genomics, isotope analyses and
   archaeology can contribute to the rewriting of our understanding of
   social organization concerning gender, mobility and occupation patterns
   in past societies.
