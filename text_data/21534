Organizations Fail to Implement Cloud Security Basics – And it Bites Them

   Oct 12 by George V. Hulme

   While the early promises in the move to cloud computing promised to

Prevention Is Not Working

   Oct 11 by Silviu Stahie

   Companies should pay a lot more attention to insider threats when they
   establish a strategy to keep their data safe. It turns out that more
   than half of data breaches can be attributed to employee actions and
   not outside forces.

When It Comes to Employees and Data, Execs Hold Mixed Views

   Oct 07 by George V. Hulme

   When it comes to enterprise data, it’s employees that create some of
   the biggest risks, yet they still hold a considerable amount of trust
   from senior cybersecurity and business leaders. That’s the dislocated
   findings from the 2019 Global Data Exposure Report, conducted by
   Forrester Consulting and commissioned by data loss protection software

Does Your Business Have a Cybersecurity Weak Spot?

   Oct 03 by Bitdefender Enterprise

   26% of IT professionals believe that they could currently be undergoing
   a breach without even knowing it. This is according to Bitdefender’s
   recent Hacked Off! report which looked at the weaknesses, stress points
   and strategy when it comes to cybersecurity in organisations. The weak
   spots revealed are particularly interesting because it highlights the
   areas which are most vulnerable for organisations as well as the things
   that are keeping IT professionals up at night – unsurprisingly, there

Patch Management a Key Area for Improvement at Most SMBs, Study Shows

   Sep 12 by Filip Truta

   Cybercriminals often exploit flaws in unpatched systems to breach an
   organization, as in the 2017 WannaCry contagion and the massive 2018
   Equifax incident. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that businesses big
   and small list patch management as a key pain point. And, according to
   a recent survey, small and medium-sized businesses are particularly
   susceptible to data breaches that use this attack avenue.

BlueKeep Exploit Code Released, Blocked by Hypervisor Introspection

   Sep 09 by Andrei Florescu
     * BlueKeep is a wormable security flaw in Microsoft Remote Desktop
       Services that allows attackers to take control remotely of
       vulnerable systems.
     * Metasploit developers released the first functional prototype of
       exploit code with payload execution capabilities.
     * Bitdefender tested the newly released exploit code and Hypervisor
       Introspection prevents this attack (demo included).

   Last Friday, security researchers working on the Metasploit project
   released the first functional exploit code to successfully achieve code
   execution against systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. This high impact
   vulnerability affecting Microsoft Remote Desktop Services was first
   reported as CVE-2019-0708 in May 2019. On May 14th, Microsoft started
   releasing patches for affected Windows OSes (including the end of life
   XP and 2003)
