Members Access Plugin ‚Äì Beta2

   WP eCommerce February 4, 2011 16 Comments

   Many of your tried the new and amazing Members Access Plugin Beta 1,
   well now we would like to announce another beta release for you to try.

   First off this is a completely new Plugin to the old members module
   currently on GetShopped so don‚Äôt be confused by the two ‚Äì this Plugin
   is like members ‚Äì extreme! So what has changed since the first Beta?!

   Better control over your users and subscriptions

   Use the menus and tables to easily manage and maintain your users
   subscriptions, you can edit, delete and update subscritipions without
   your members needed to re-purchase.

   The important functionality makes it easy to apply bulk options to your
   wordpress users quickly and easily.

   Compatible with WP e-Commerce 3.8

   This Plugin now works with WP e-Commerce 3.8. With the new custom post
   types in 3.8 we are working on using this plugin to not only restrict
   posts and pages but individual products as well ‚Äì This is great if you
   want to create whole sale accounts or restrict certain products.

   New Widget

   Thanks to the team at light speed we have incorporated a new widget
   into our plugin ‚Äì This widget lets your uses see their subscriptions
   and any post or pages that the capability is associated with.

   Custom Message

   Add a custom message to the ‚Äúsorry you must login page‚Äù for each
   subscription type ‚Äì this can include links images whatever you like to
   help sell your subscription!

   Less Bugs

   Thanks to all your feedback and testing all bugs have been squashed and
   we are nearly ready to launch ‚Äì please if you notice anything or have
   any ideas why testing this report it here so we can work on squashing
   any bugs left behind!

   For a list of full Plugin features check this list out from Beta 1.

   Greetings,

   I like the custom message function, but it only accepts text (adds
   slashes to the html), so i can not add media previews, or a buy button
   like i had with the previous way of adding preview short tags on the
   actual post/page.

   In addition, it appears that the short tag [preview] [/preview] has
   been entirely disabled, i assume since there is this new custom message
   function, but it is useless if you want to allow a rich content
   preview.

   Do advise.

   Thanks in advance..

   Hi,

   Plugin with added internationalisation and ‚Äúpreview‚Äù shortcode
   available on my blog:
   http://blog.meloniq.net/2011/01/08/wordpress-platne-wpisy-dostep-do-tre
   sci-paid-content/

   PS. in a next few days I‚Äôll review plugin code to correct functionality
   on ‚ÄúEdit Product Page‚Äù
   Reply

   by Mychelle post author February 17, 2011

   This functionality has already been corrected in this version of the
   members plugin. I would suggest you merge your changes with that one

   by Ze February 14, 2011

   thanks for the ‚Äúpreview‚Äù shortcode update Andrzej but once the member
   is logged in, they still get both the preview image, and the content as
   well‚Ä¶

   ‚Äì the older preview tag took out what was inside the [preview]
   [/preview] tags when the user logged in.

   it would be good if HTML could be inserted into the new members beta2
   area under ‚ÄúCustom Message‚Äù where you make a custom message‚Ä¶ because
   that seems to work fine, it just dosent accept html‚Ä¶ the short tag
   would not be needed in that case. it would separate the preview msg,
   and the actual content.

   by Mychelle post author February 17, 2011

   I will look at allowing HTML in the custom message ‚Äì the preview
   shortcode was removed because it wouldn‚Äôt play nicely with the custom
   message.

   However like you say having the content separate from the preview is a
   good idea so I will look at this.

   Thanks for your testing and feed back

   another short note on capabilities:

   once the member joins. the login window disappears from the other pages
   that they didnt join‚Ä¶.

   at fist without being logged in, there are log in windows.

   i know that is tricky, but just wanted to bring it up.

   kind regards

   by Mychelle post author February 17, 2011

   are you sure it didn‚Äôt dissapear because they are now already logged
   in? (therefore loggin in again is not required they simply don‚Äôt have
   the capability to view the post)

   I will check this out
   Reply

   by Ze February 18, 2011

   ok right, i get your point. there would be no need to log-in again.

   just needs to be explained to them‚Ä¶

   as far as the custom message that works great, so HTML possibility
   would totally remove the need for the preview tag. in fact i could not
   use the tag or the message, i just made blowup thumbnails on my product
   listings for now, with add to cart under and totally took off the
   public access to the live pages. at this point i am just emailing them
   their link‚Ä¶

   thanks for your help.

   kind regards

   Hey Frank

   Yip we lost the use of the preview tag when the custom stuff went in ‚Äì
   bit of a shame but I like keeping it separate ‚Äì HTML and images have
   not been implemented yet but it is on the list and this plug-in is now
   considered stable and ready for use!

   Feature list to follow and new features should be implemented pretty
   quickly.

   Thanks for your support and following this project

   Hi. Does this plugin allow you to restrict access to a certain custom
   post type? For instance, I have a recipe site that I want to allow all
   users to view the entire site including the indexes of the recipes that
   only have a recipe title, thumbnail, and excerpt so as to entice users
   (archive-recipe.php). BUT I want to restrict viewing of
   single-recipe.php to only logged-in, paid members.

   Is this possible? I don‚Äôt have gold cart to try this plugin yet, but if
   this is possible, then I‚Äôd probably have use for it.

   Oh, and is this compatible with BuddyPress too, generally speaking? As
   in, they play nice together?
   Reply

   by Mychelle post author March 30, 2011

   Hi Thompson ‚Äì sorry for taking so long to get back to you ‚Äì it will
   play nice with buddy press but are the pages you want to restrict
   wordpress pages or buddy press pages?

   With this plugin you can include a custom message for the not logged in
   users trying to view the page ‚Äì as a way to entice users, a bit more
   work will be going into this however as this is a free beta I would
   just download it and see how you get on (note this beta version does
   not require Gold Cart)

   Give it a go you have nothing to loose!

   I added and configured th plugin for one product but still the product
   price and image is being displayed to public.
   http://www.comfort-flow.com/wholesellers-store/?page_id=5

   If a user is able to see wholesale price then this plugin is not
   useful. Please suggest how can we hide complete product info

   I bought this plugin, but it isn‚Äôt working properly. When I try to
   checkout it gives me the error ‚ÄúInvalid Regular period. You must
   specify valid values for the A3, P3, and T3 parameters for a
   subscription.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see any solutions to this problem.

   Hi slicerad,

   Have you filled out all the payment information about the recurring
   billing for the product? You do this in the add / edit product page.

   Thanks

   Hello,
   This plugin interests me very much.
   I have a pre-purchase question, though.

   I need to sell permanent access to individual videos that will be
   watched online.

   So the videos will be sold one by one, and the customer should be able
   to watch all of what he has purchased through a single login, not using
   100 different links if he has purchased 100 videos.

   Do you follow me?

   Is this possible?

   Thanks
