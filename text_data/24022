Corporate Governance Business Roundtable Redefines the Purpose of a
Corporation to Promote ‘An Economy That Serves All Americans’

Aug 19, 2019

   Updated Statement Moves Away from Shareholder Primacy, Includes
   Commitment to All Stakeholders
     __________________________________________________________________

   WASHINGTON – Business Roundtable today announced the release of a new
   Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation signed by 181 CEOs who commit
   to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders –
   customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.

   Since 1978, Business Roundtable has periodically issued Principles of
   Corporate Governance. Each version of the document issued since 1997
   has endorsed principles of shareholder primacy – that corporations
   exist principally to serve shareholders. With today’s announcement, the
   new Statement supersedes previous statements and outlines a modern
   standard for corporate responsibility.

   “The American dream is alive, but fraying,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman
   and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Chairman of Business Roundtable.
   “Major employers are investing in their workers and communities because
   they know it is the only way to be successful over the long term. These
   modernized principles reflect the business community’s unwavering
   commitment to continue to push for an economy that serves all
   Americans.”

   “This new statement better reflects the way corporations can and should
   operate today,” added Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief
   Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson and Chair of the Business
   Roundtable Corporate Governance Committee. “It affirms the essential
   role corporations can play in improving our society when CEOs are truly
   committed to meeting the needs of all stakeholders.”

   Industry leaders also lent their support for the updated Business
   Roundtable Statement, citing the positive impact this commitment will
   have on long-term value creation:

   “I welcome this thoughtful statement by Business Roundtable CEOs on the
   Purpose of a Corporation. By taking a broader, more complete view of
   corporate purpose, boards can focus on creating long-term value, better
   serving everyone – investors, employees, communities, suppliers and
   customers,” said Bill McNabb, former CEO of Vanguard.

   “CEOs work to generate profits and return value to shareholders, but
   the best-run companies do more. They put the customer first and invest
   in their employees and communities. In the end, it’s the most promising
   way to build long-term value,” said Tricia Griffith, President and CEO
   of Progressive Corporation.

   “This is tremendous news because it is more critical than ever that
   businesses in the 21st century are focused on generating long-term
   value for all stakeholders and addressing the challenges we face, which
   will result in shared prosperity and sustainability for both business
   and society,” said Darren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation.

   The Business Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation is
   below and the full list of signatories is available here.

   Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation

   Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through
   hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity. We
   believe the free-market system is the best means of generating good
   jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy
   environment and economic opportunity for all.

   Businesses play a vital role in the economy by creating jobs, fostering
   innovation and providing essential goods and services. Businesses make
   and sell consumer products; manufacture equipment and vehicles; support
   the national defense; grow and produce food; provide health care;
   generate and deliver energy; and offer financial, communications and
   other services that underpin economic growth.

   While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate
   purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders.
   We commit to:
     * Delivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of
       American companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer
       expectations.
     * Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them
       fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes
       supporting them through training and education that help develop
       new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and
       inclusion, dignity and respect.
     * Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated
       to serving as good partners to the other companies, large and
       small, that help us meet our missions.
     * Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people
       in our communities and protect the environment by embracing
       sustainable practices across our businesses.
     * Generating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the
       capital that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are
       committed to transparency and effective engagement with
       shareholders.

   Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to
   all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities
   and our country.

Leadership in Action

   U.S. corporations play a vital role in American society as engines of
   creativity, innovation and economic opportunity. The long-term success
   of these companies and the U.S. economy depends on businesses investing
   in the economic security of their employees and the communities in
   which they operate. From offering competitive wages and benefits to
   developing training programs to enrich the skills of students and adult
   workers, leading U.S. employers are creating opportunities for
   Americans to secure well-paying jobs and build fulfilling careers.

Driving Solutions

   As leaders of America's largest companies, Business Roundtable CEOs
   believe we have a responsibility to help build a strong and sustainable
   economic future in the United States. That means creating quality jobs
   and good wages and benefits. It requires action to increase opportunity
   and raise living standards. It demands advancing public policies that
   better enable people of all backgrounds to achieve their potential.
   Together with partners in the public, private and non-profit sectors,
   Business Roundtable CEOs are committed to driving solutions that make a
   meaningful difference for workers, families, communities and businesses
   of all sizes.

   *statistics based on 2017 data

Up to the Challenge

   Fueled by the promise of opportunity and the power of innovation, the
   United States has built the world’s most vibrant, diverse and dynamic
   economy. Our nation’s future prosperity and competitiveness now depends
   on meeting pressing economic challenges we face today.

Supporting Free and Fair Trade

   Free and fair trade is vital to American economic prosperity. We rely
   on mutually beneficial trade relationships with our neighbors near and
   far because open, two-way trade and investment means more opportunity
   for every America.

Rebuilding America’s Economic Foundation

   Once a national economic asset, America's deteriorating infrastructure
   now stands as one of the largest impediments to strong and sustained
   economic growth. Our nation's long-term competitiveness depends on
   addressing these pressing infrastructure needs today.

Creating Pathways to Career Success

   A strong American economy demands a skilled, diverse and competitive
   U.S. workforce. Action is needed now to better align education,
   training and workforce readiness programs to the jobs of today and
   careers of the future.

Maintaining America's Tax Competitiveness

   Today's U.S. corporate tax system is on par with the rest of the
   developed world, encouraging companies to invest in America, benefiting
   U.S. workers, families and communities. Policymakers should preserve
   and build upon this system to promote strong, sustained economic
   growth.

Innovation Nation: An American Innovation Agenda for 2020

Business Roundtable CEOs have put forward a cross-cutting policy agenda to
secure U.S. leadership in innovation, maintain a robust U.S. economy and
increase living standards for all Americans through 2020 and beyond.
