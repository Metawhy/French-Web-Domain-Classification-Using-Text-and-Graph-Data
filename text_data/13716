     In the beginning, you don‚Äôt need the most complex tools out there.

     You need an affordable solution that‚Äôs going to provide data in an
     understandable form. That‚Äôs where Mangools excels.

     Mangools has a good mix of simple and advanced data for both newbies
     and experienced users to work with.

     This is in contrast to some other tools, which have too many
     advanced settings and data for newbies to figure out quickly.

Categories & advanced filters

Focus on specific types of backlinks

   Why browsing through hundreds of backlinks? üîé Narrow down the analysis
   with advanced filters and categories such as blogs, Q&As and forums or
   just simply hide nofollow and already deleted backlinks.
