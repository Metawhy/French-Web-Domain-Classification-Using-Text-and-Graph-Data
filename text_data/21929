We’re changing the way you go to the doctor

   This is no ordinary doctor’s office. Rather than do things the typical
   way, we’ve created a membership-based primary care practice truly
   designed around your needs. From same-day appointments that start on
   time to compassionate providers who listen to 24/7 video visits, we
   make it faster, easier, and more enjoyable to get care — whenever and
   wherever you need it.

   Locations

Offices you’ll want to visit

   We’ve positioned our beautiful offices near where you live, work, and
   travel. You can schedule same- or next-day appointments that start on
   time.

   Services

Top providers with time to talk

   Our appointments are longer, and you'll spend the whole time with an
   exceptional provider who really listens and who knows what they’re
   talking about. You also get an in-house support team to guide and
   advocate for you through questions about billing, finding providers,
   insurance, and more.

   Technology

Care in the palm of your hand

   We integrate technology into all aspects of our practice to provide you
   with coordinated, seamless care — no matter where you are. Download our
   app to schedule appointments, renew prescriptions, or message your
   provider on the go. When you can't get to an office, use our video
   visits to connect with a provider 24/7.
