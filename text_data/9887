FAQs: General Information About Marriott Bonvoy Rewards Program

General Information

What is Marriott Bonvoy™?

   Open

   Marriott International’s loyalty program is Marriott Bonvoy™. Prior to
   February 2019, the program operated under three names: Marriott
   Rewards®, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards® and Starwood Preferred Guest®
   (SPG®).

Why Marriott Bonvoy? Why now?

   Open

   From August 2018 through February 2019, our three programs shared a
   unified currency, Elite Status and benefits. But this was temporary
   while we created a new name and branding for one single program. In
   February the three programs became Marriott Bonvoy. It’s the same great
   program with a single new name, look and attitude. The name Bonvoy is
   derived from bon voyage, which means “good travels.” We believe travel
   is good because it has the power to transform, educate and enrich our
   Members and those they meet around the world.

What changed besides the name and look for Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton
Rewards and SPG?

   Open

   Rest assured there are no substantive changes to the program that
   Members know and love. Member benefits remain the same under our new
   branding. However, two of our Elite tier names have changed. Platinum
   Premier Elite is now Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite, and Platinum
   Premier Elite with ambassador service is now Marriott Bonvoy Ambassador
   Elite. The benefits associated with these Elite tiers remain the same.
   Additionally, all of the program changes implemented in August 2018 are
   intact, including how Members earn and redeem, Elite Status and
   benefits, Lifetime Elite Status and benefits, currency, Participating
   Properties, Participating Brands, Membership Account and credit cards.

Where can I use my Marriott Bonvoy Membership?

   Open

   You can use your loyalty program membership at 7,000+ participating
   hotels across our extraordinary portfolio of brands in 131 countries.
   Learn more about our brands.

What are the benefits of joining Marriott Bonvoy?

   Open

   Marriott Bonvoy allows you access to a wide range of benefits,
   including earning Points for Free Night Award stays, exclusive Member
   Rates, setting reservation preferences, ability to use all features
   within the Mobile App, a speedier reservation process on our websites
   and more. After joining Marriott Bonvoy and activating your online
   Account, you will be able to manage your Account information online;
   view your Points balance, your past and upcoming reservation activity,
   the best offers available; and more.

How much does it cost to join Marriott Bonvoy?

   Open

   Membership is free. Always. Simply complete the online enrollment form
   to join.

How do I join and activate my Account?

   Open

   Simply enroll online with your email address and password. Once you
   complete the quick and easy process of creating your online
   credentials, you will be able to manage your Account information
   online, view your Account balance and much more.

I am an existing Marriott Rewards, SPG or The Ritz-Carlton Rewards Member. Do
I need to sign up for Marriott Bonvoy?

   Open

   Existing members from one of our legacy programs are all set to enjoy
   Marriott Bonvoy with your existing member number and password there is
   no further action required. However, if you had more than one account
   (for example, an SPG account and Marriott Rewards account) and did not
   combine them, you must request to combine your Points and nights into a
   single account.

How do I enter my personal preferences?

   Open

   You can save your preferences in your Membership Account and be assured
   everything will be just the way you want it, every time you check in —
   including your preferred credit card, how many towels you need, the
   pillows you like and the type of room you prefer. First, log in to your
   Account and visit the Account Overview page. From there, go to
   “Profile” to enter or update your preferences.

London

   In London, Marriott hotel guests quickly find that history is tangible
   at sites like Westminster Abbey, British Museum and Tower of London.
   Medieval-era walls and pristine Georgian Squares are common, even on a
   casual stroll. Elsewhere in the city, venues like Olympic Park, Hyde
   Park and Wembley Stadium boast state-of-the-art facilities for
   concert-goers and football fans. Plus, the winding streets and alleys
   are abundant with London gastropub.

   Discover iconic London architecture at attractions like St. Paul’s
   Cathedral. Originally constructed in the late 17th century, the
   cathedral serves today as the seat of the Bishop on London in the
   Anglican Church. Tour the underground crypt or marvel in the dome
   standing 364 feet tall. Also, be sure to snap a picture of Tower
   Bridge, arguably the city’s most iconic bridge.

   Plan a day or two on your trip to London to explore one of its many
   outdoor markets. Borough Market in the Southwark neighborhood offers a
   wide variety of fresh and prepared food, and if you’d like a souvenir,
   check out Greenwich Market for local crafts like jewelry or ceramics.

   When you strike out from your hotel’s front door, you’ll be greeted by
   a thrillingly fast pace and array of London attractions. Nowhere does
   this hold truer than in the city’s nightlife, where the UK capital’s
   true versatility reveals itself in layers. Whether you’d prefer to have
   just a few pints at a rustic London gastropub or search for the city’s
   most elusive dance clubs, you’ll find there’s something for everyone.

London

   In London, Marriott hotel guests quickly find that history is tangible
   at sites like Westminster Abbey, British Museum and Tower of London.
   Medieval-era walls and pristine Georgian Squares are common, even on a
   casual stroll. Elsewhere in the city, venues like Olympic Park, Hyde
   Park and Wembley Stadium boast state-of-the-art facilities for
   concert-goers and football fans. Plus, the winding streets and alleys
   are abundant with London gastropub.

   Discover iconic London architecture at attractions like St. Paul’s
   Cathedral. Originally constructed in the late 17th century, the
   cathedral serves today as the seat of the Bishop on London in the
   Anglican Church. Tour the underground crypt or marvel in the dome
   standing 364 feet tall. Also, be sure to snap a picture of Tower
   Bridge, arguably the city’s most iconic bridge.

   Plan a day or two on your trip to London to explore one of its many
   outdoor markets. Borough Market in the Southwark neighborhood offers a
   wide variety of fresh and prepared food, and if you’d like a souvenir,
   check out Greenwich Market for local crafts like jewelry or ceramics.

   When you strike out from your hotel’s front door, you’ll be greeted by
   a thrillingly fast pace and array of London attractions. Nowhere does
   this hold truer than in the city’s nightlife, where the UK capital’s
   true versatility reveals itself in layers. Whether you’d prefer to have
   just a few pints at a rustic London gastropub or search for the city’s
   most elusive dance clubs, you’ll find there’s something for everyone.

London

   In London, Marriott hotel guests quickly find that history is tangible
   at sites like Westminster Abbey, British Museum and Tower of London.
   Medieval-era walls and pristine Georgian Squares are common, even on a
   casual stroll. Elsewhere in the city, venues like Olympic Park, Hyde
   Park and Wembley Stadium boast state-of-the-art facilities for
   concert-goers and football fans. Plus, the winding streets and alleys
   are abundant with London gastropub.

   Discover iconic London architecture at attractions like St. Paul’s
   Cathedral. Originally constructed in the late 17th century, the
   cathedral serves today as the seat of the Bishop on London in the
   Anglican Church. Tour the underground crypt or marvel in the dome
   standing 364 feet tall. Also, be sure to snap a picture of Tower
   Bridge, arguably the city’s most iconic bridge.

   Plan a day or two on your trip to London to explore one of its many
   outdoor markets. Borough Market in the Southwark neighborhood offers a
   wide variety of fresh and prepared food, and if you’d like a souvenir,
   check out Greenwich Market for local crafts like jewelry or ceramics.

   When you strike out from your hotel’s front door, you’ll be greeted by
   a thrillingly fast pace and array of London attractions. Nowhere does
   this hold truer than in the city’s nightlife, where the UK capital’s
   true versatility reveals itself in layers. Whether you’d prefer to have
   just a few pints at a rustic London gastropub or search for the city’s
   most elusive dance clubs, you’ll find there’s something for everyone.
