   ems-messagesems-message August 2018A 305-year continuous monthly
   rainfall series for the Island of Ireland (1711-2016)
   22/08/2018

A 305-year continuous monthly rainfall series for the Island of Ireland
(1711-2016)

   Dr Conor Murphy (left), Maynooth University with the President of the
   Irish Meteorological Society, Declan Murphy. Photo credit: Ciara Ryan.

   On 19th June 2018 the Irish Meteorological Society hosted its last
   lecture of the 2017/18 season. Dr. Conor Murphy of the Irish Climate
   Analysis and Research Unit (ICARUS) in the Department of Geography in
   Maynooth University, gave a talk about work that was done to produce a
   305-year continuous monthly rainfall series for the island of Ireland.

   Dr. Murphy, with colleagues from Maynooth University, Met Éireann, the
   Met Office in the UK, and many universities, institutions and centres
   in the UK and Austria, worked together to compile and analyse the
   continuous monthly rainfall series for the period 1711-2016. A UK Met
   Office document from 1979 was rediscovered in a refurbishment of Met
   Éireann in recent years. That document provides a continuous monthly
   rainfall series for the island of Ireland from 1711 to 1977 based on
   weather diaries and early observations. The rainfall data from 1711 to
   1977 were merged with a homogenised monthly rainfall network for
   Ireland for a 160-year period from 1850 to 2010 (published in 2016 by
   Simon Noone from Maynooth University and colleagues) to give a rainfall
   series of over 300 years.

   Dr. Murphy spoke of the challenges that come with developing a
   reliable, precipitation series over three centuries. Precipitation in
   solid form, like snow, or liquid form such as rain requires careful
   measurement. There have been changes over time  to the way that weather
   observers take these measurements, with measurement of snow being a
   particular challenge and snowfall measurement often being
   under-measured. The design of rain gauges was in its infancy in the
   1700s and 1800s. One gauge in particular was noted as being 12 inches
   in diameter and located on the ridge of an observer’s house. Rainfall
   varies widely from one place to another so it is important for rain
   gauges to have a similar design and exposure to allow comparison of
   rainfall measurements. In the mid-1800s George J Symons pioneered the
   standardisation of rain gauges. Today, the World Meteorological
   Organisation provides guidelines on the siting, location and design of
   rain gauges.

   In this paper by Murphy et al.,  insights into the long-term rainfall
   patterns of Ireland can be gleamed. For example, it shows that the most
   recent decade (2006-2015) was the wettest in over 300 years. The
   1850-2010 study also showed that long droughts often occurred in the
   1800s.

   About EMSEMS History

EMS History

   The history of the society already started before its actual formal
   foundation. The first EMS Newsletter was published in 1996 and
   contained short profiles, reports on current activities and contact
   addresses of national meteorological societies in Europe. Then, as
   today, the purpose of such a network was to communicate, inform and
   co-ordinate activities of the national societies in order to strengthen
   their potentials.

   A paper by René Morin and Jon Wieringa recording the history of
   founding the EMS has been published in two parts in Weather. The paper
   is entitled “Associating weather societies across Europe”.
     * Part 1: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.3078/full (5
       Jan 2018)
     * Part 2: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.3089/full
       (18 Jan 2018)

   Formally the founding process was completed in 1999 in Norrköping,
   Sweden, during the European Conference on Applications of Meteorology.

   The first EMS Annual Meeting was held in 2001, during the 5th European
   Conference on Applications of Meteorology in Budapest, organised as a
   lecture and round table discussion on the Future of Meteorology. From
   2004 the format of the EMS Annual Meeting was developed as a conference
   with a public call for contributions. Also the spectrum of themes
   covered in the meetings has expanded.

   Partnership with the European Conference on Applications of Meteorology
   (ECAM) has continued in the form of joint organisation of both these
   meetings biennially. In addition the European Conference on Applied
   Climatology (ECAC) under the auspices of ECSN of EUMETNET, now the
   EUMETNET Climate Programme, became a partner in the organisation of the
   conference in alternate years.

   The EMS Annual Meeting, as the main focus of activity since its birth,
   has been moving round Europe – Hungary, Belgium, Romania, Italy,
   France, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Poland,
   the UK, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Italy and the most recent in
   Ireland in 2017.

   In 2004 EMS formulated its then mission. It includes
     * Advancement of science, practice and application of meteorology at
       a Europe-wide level.
     * Promotion of public understanding of meteorology.
     * Support of member societies to benefit all classes of their
       individual members in both the applied and research fields.
     * Promotion of the exchange of ideas and information between
       individual members.
     * Interaction with other relevant bodies.
     * Promotion of the discussion designed to ensure that meteorology
       makes its maximum contribution to human and economic welfare.
     * Ensuring that national and international activity concerned with
       climate change is motivated by the best possible meteorological
       advice.
