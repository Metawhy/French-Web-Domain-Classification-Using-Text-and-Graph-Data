The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is now part of Earth Alliance

A new philanthropic partnership dedicated to urgently addressing climate
change and environmental threats to life on Earth.

   A new organization to help address the urgent threats to our planet’s
   life support systems, Earth Alliance marks the next step in the
   evolution of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as it works to accelerate
   the rate of change and adoption of environmental solutions on a global
   scale.

   Born out of the shared passion of its founding co-chairs: actor and
   activist Leonardo DiCaprio, businesswoman and philanthropist Laurene
   Powell Jobs, and investor and philanthropist Brian Sheth – the Alliance
   seeks to bring together the best minds in science, conservation and
   philanthropy to urgently respond to a growing climate crisis and the
   staggering loss of biodiversity threatening the stability of life on
   Earth.

   LDF, together with its Alliance partners Emerson Collective and Global
   Wildlife Conservation, will focus on addressing the intertwined threats
   of climate change and biodiversity loss through its global work to
   protect ecosystems and wildlife, ensure climate justice, support
   renewable energy, and secure indigenous rights to the benefit of all
   life on Earth.

     “Clean air, water, and a livable climate are inalienable human
     rights. And solving this crisis is not a question of politics, it is
     a question of our own survival.”

     “In a few decades, the relationship between the environment,
     resources, and conflict may seem almost as obvious as the connection
     we see today between human rights, democracy, and peace.”

     “Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread
     within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things
     are bound together… all things connect.”
