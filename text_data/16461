   We're mobilising our MBA students to use the frameworks, knowledge and
   experience they've accumulated at INSEAD to help out an organisation
   with social impact. Through 'Master Strategist Day' – a collaboration
   with our Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society – our
   students are lending support to Unjani Clinic, a South African network
   of healthcare clinics that provide accessible, affordable and quality
   healthcare to communities in low income areas. In early 2019, some of
   these students will travel to South Africa to consult with Unjani. They
   will take what they learn in the classroom and put it into practice
   where it matters most – communities that need quality healthcare. We
   will keep you posted! #INSEADforGood

   Every new MBA class helps INSEAD give back to our local communities in
   both France and Singapore when they join – the MBA Class of December
   2019 is no different! This week, students starting on our Asia Campus
   helped build a cycling track for Movement for the Intellectually
   Disabled of Singapore (MINDS), while those starting on our Europe
   Campus finish building a playground for the Institut Médico-Educatif
   today – both builds facilitated by @splashprojects These projects help
   our students to bond, develop their leadership skills in a practical
   context, and – most importantly – be a force for good in the world.

   They say an INSEAD MBA is ‘diverse’ and ‘transformative’. We’re not
   sure that the #INSEADdash is strictly what they mean, but you can’t say
   our students don’t look good in their costumes! Taken today on our
   Europe Campus.

   Taking notes during Professor Philip Parker’s @inseadalumni Forum Asia
   lecture on Using Artificial Intelligence to Eliminate Content Poverty.
   Did you know that Professor Parker has developed #AI tools to bring
   knowledge to underserved communities around the world? For example
   children’s textbooks for literacy and numeracy in underserved languages
   written by bots, or providing key tips to farmers in remote areas, in
   over 180 languages – check out totoagriculture.org! #INSEADforum

   We're mobilising our MBA students to use the frameworks, knowledge and
   experience they've accumulated at INSEAD to help out an organisation
   with social impact. Through 'Master Strategist Day' – a collaboration
   with our Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society – our
   students are lending support to Unjani Clinic, a South African network
   of healthcare clinics that provide accessible, affordable and quality
   healthcare to communities in low income areas. In early 2019, some of
   these students will travel to South Africa to consult with Unjani. They
   will take what they learn in the classroom and put it into practice
   where it matters most – communities that need quality healthcare. We
   will keep you posted! #INSEADforGood

   Every new MBA class helps INSEAD give back to our local communities in
   both France and Singapore when they join – the MBA Class of December
   2019 is no different! This week, students starting on our Asia Campus
   helped build a cycling track for Movement for the Intellectually
   Disabled of Singapore (MINDS), while those starting on our Europe
   Campus finish building a playground for the Institut Médico-Educatif
   today – both builds facilitated by @splashprojects These projects help
   our students to bond, develop their leadership skills in a practical
   context, and – most importantly – be a force for good in the world.

   They say an INSEAD MBA is ‘diverse’ and ‘transformative’. We’re not
   sure that the #INSEADdash is strictly what they mean, but you can’t say
   our students don’t look good in their costumes! Taken today on our
   Europe Campus.

   Taking notes during Professor Philip Parker’s @inseadalumni Forum Asia
   lecture on Using Artificial Intelligence to Eliminate Content Poverty.
   Did you know that Professor Parker has developed #AI tools to bring
   knowledge to underserved communities around the world? For example
   children’s textbooks for literacy and numeracy in underserved languages
   written by bots, or providing key tips to farmers in remote areas, in
   over 180 languages – check out totoagriculture.org! #INSEADforum
