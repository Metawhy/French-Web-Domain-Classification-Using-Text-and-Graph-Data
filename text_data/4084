Summer is Almost Over!

   by admin

   I feel so weird saying summer is almost over, but it is!

   As a parent preparing to send the children back to school, whether as a
   home school or public school student, spending is key. I start
   searching for great deals a week or two into July, as many retailers
   start to clear out the summer goods and bring in the massive amounts of
   binders, filler paper and highlighters.

   Shopping for school supplies can be a huge expense – if you let it. But
   many retailers, such as Staples and Office Max, offer many 1, 5 and 25
   cent deals the month or so before the school year begins. Keeping an
   eye out for these deals can save you a ton of money, even if they have
   a minimum purchase requirement.

   My favorite part about Staples is they offer free shipping on many
   items if you are a rewards member. I also consider that Walmart, while
   it is a hassle to shop, offers price-matching. This can save a lot of
   time, energy and gas when there are deals at several stores in one
   week. They also offer a handy shopping list for specific grades on
   their website – see image link above for more details!

   I like to stock up on items that don’t go bad. I won’t grab a large
   supply of packaged treats for lunchboxes…but I will be sure to grab a
   huge supply of pens and pencils while they are on “super” sale as I
   like to call it! I stock up for the year, then anything that is left
   over I will donate to underprivileged children for the following school
   year. This way, my kiddos get to pick out their favorites every year
   (new binders with favorite characters, etc) and learn to help others in
   the mean time! Sure, filler paper and other items can last in my home
   for years and years if my supply is large enough, but it is good to
   take the opportunity to donate as well!

   For deals from the Staples Back To School Center, I suggest taking a
   peek at their weekly ad for your area in the next few weeks.

   If you bring in the Staples ad to WalMart, the cashier will price match
   identical items for you! Not bad!

Knocked Up? Check Out These Cuties!

   by admin

   For me, part of the fun during pregnancy is a new wardrobe.

   Lets face it, we can only get away with our “fat jeans” and baggy
   sweaters for so long! Once your belly really pops, its time to hit the
   mall! While I was grateful to have found some sweet deals at thrift
   stores and hand-me-downs from friends in my size, I also splurged on a
   few items that were more my style.

   Just a couple generations ago, being pregnant had absolutely NO style
   to it! If you have seen old photos of your mother or grandmother during
   pregnancy, you know what I mean. Having a baby was nearly a fashion
   death sentence! Massive moo-moo style dresses and tops, colors that
   make you want to vomit…thank goodness for the mass production of todays
   clothing that allows us to dress stylishly on Any budget during those
   fabulous nine months and beyond!

   So whether you have a bun in the oven yourself, or want to get a fun
   gift for a friend who is… check out some of these super cute t-shirt
   options below! I just love these! Maybe some cute preggo clothing will
   convince my husband to have another ;)

   A little funny, a little angry, a little cute – this shirt is perfect!
   Reminds me a little of those raging hormones when you just want to slap
   the next person who touches your belly or asks if you’re pregnant!

   Peeking out of the belly! I snorted with laughter upon seeing this
   adorable top! And for some reason I just love the little curl of hair
   on the baby – why does it remind me of that old restaurant Bob’s Big
   Boy?!  Check out Cutsie Tootsy Apparel Etsy shop for many colors and
   styles of this side-ruched (perfect for growing bigger!) top!
   powers

   Adorable, right?! I love this one because it reminds me of my husband.
   He watches all those weird super power television shows where people
   read minds, heal quickly and never seem to die. He always says “Whoa,
   how did they do THAT?!!” and I remind him it’s just a T.V. show! Super
   powers aren’t real!!…or are they…??!

   All these ideas are so cute! But don’t forget you can always make your
   own clothes, too! Cut apart old t-shirts, bring out your stencils and
   t-shirt paints and go to town! And never forget the power of a great
   yard sale, either!

Halloween Costume Favorites!

   by admin

   I swear that time is moving faster than it did when I was a child.

   Back when I counted down the days until summer vacation and when it
   finally came, summer lasted forever…then school started and it seemed
   like an eternity before it was time for the holidays!

   But these days, it feels like weeks or month can go by in the blink of
   an eye. I feel like summer just started, now we are already decorating
   our home for Halloween and making plans for Christmas vacation!

   I know Halloween is not until the end of this month, but I will
   probably take a nap to rest my tired eyes and wake up to find out that
   Halloween is tomorrow. So, in the honor of anti-procrastination, I
   thought I would share some of my favorite costume ideas with you. Yes,
   I know that some of my favorites are for babies…which my kiddos are not
   anymore…but I had to show these adorable ideas with you!
   costume1

   Image Source: thisplaceisnowahome.wordpress.com

   This is by far on of the cutest infant ideas I have ever seen. I think
   it would be especially funny if the mom or dad dressed as a hotdog or
   other movie night snacks. The instructions can be found at This Place
   Is Now a Home.


   costume2

   I just fell in love with this little girl when I saw her costume. I
   think her beautiful big blue eyes really make this costume truly look
   like a legitimate Cabbage Patch Kid. I would love to see it done
   looking like the doll I had when I was a child – with a poofy, frilly,
   pink dress and some Mary Jane style shoes…and a birth certificate to
   complete the look!


   costume3

   Image Source: costume-works.com

   Macaroni and Cheese is a staple food item in our home, so this costume
   gave me a good laugh… not to mention that we go through a TON of toilet
   paper, as does any household with young kiddos, so it would not take
   long for us to save to make this up-cycled toilet paper tube creation!


   costume4

   Image Source: people.com

   An Oompa Loompa! I get that this little one is the most adorable Oompa
   Loompa ever seen, but my reason for loving it might be a little on the
   mean side. My sister is deathly afraid of the Oompa Loompas in Charlie
   and the Chocolate Factory. As a kid, she would run out of the room
   screaming whenever they would appear during the movie. To this day,
   when we watch the movie with our own children, I still see her turn her
   head or close her eyes! So for me, this would make for a perfectly
   scary costume for one of my kids this Halloween when we meet up with
   her family to Trick or Treat! Mean, yes…but it is Halloween, after all!

   More Halloween ideas coming soon… thanks for reading!

Exploding Science Projects for Kids!

   by admin

   I remember my childhood and all those boring science videos and books.
   I never had fun with science until there was a hands on project that I
   got to be a part of. Things that “exploded” were always the most fun!

   So today I wanted to share a couple fun “exploding” science projects to
   keep your kids entertained while learning how things work at the same
   time. These are great outdoor or, if you wish, in the kitchen summer
   projects! Follow the links to some great, easy to use tutorials for
   these fun projects!

   A fun volcano project, with a tutorial done in a bathtub that comes
   complete with fun jungle style painting!

   I don’t know of a kid that would not love this balloon explosion
   project! Just a few simple ingredients will lead to hours of fun with
   this tutorial.

   This tutorial is a great lesson in science. The kiddos mix specific
   ingredients to see which one will make the greatest eruption.
   Ingredients used are ones you most likely have already in your pantry,
   allowing your kiddos to be up and running their own experiments in no
   time!

   Lastly is a great tutorial for film canister rockets. We used to make
   these all the time as kids for hours of play time and lots of laughing.

A Showerhead for the Little Ones

   by admin

   Being a parent can be difficult during bath time.

   The kids are too small to really get any effect out of the shower head
   so we resort to dumping buckets of water on them to get the soap off.
   Once they get a little older, we give them more privacy, but they come
   out of the shower with soapy heads. So we get that bucket out again or
   try to shoot them with the handheld sprayer that they couldn’t reach,
   all the while soaking ourselves to the point of no return except a
   fresh outfit.

   Well, the “shower people” finally came up with an amazing solution.
   showerhead

   This product, called the Rinse Ace My Own Shower, easily mounts to the
   shower head with attachment. It can be easily reached by the kiddos
   allowing them to take a shower easily at Their height. It also easily
   detaches when it is time for adults to shower. It also comes in a fun,
   cartoon-y design making bath time more fun… and when the kids are
   having more fun, so are we!

   This can be purchased at several retailers, including Bed Bath and
   Beyond, for about $15. Don’t forget your 20% off coupon for extra
   savings!

Baby Shower Gifts

   by admin

   I am often asked for ideas on gifts for baby showers.

   Showers of any kind are difficult, especially if the shower is for
   someone you are just an acquaintance of. We tend to spend more if the
   shower is being held for a sibling or close friend, so the gifts are
   generous. But what do you do when you just do not have the budget to
   buy a pricey gift, or you just do not know they person well enough to
   justify an expensive item?

   There are so many creative ideas for easily creating themed gifts or
   specific gift baskets. If you are in to couponing, you probably have a
   million tiny or sample sized bottles of baby lotions and potions around
   the house to fill up a basket. If not, try hitting up the travel
   section for small sized items. You may be able to get 6 different
   lotions for $6 versus spending $6 or more for just one large bottle.
   This instantly helps you when trying to make your gift “appear” bigger.
   It also helps in creating a tiny, baby sized gift. Everything tiny is
   cute at showers!

   Want some other gift ideas? Check out a few of my favorites!

   These numbered onesies are adorable and make for a fabulous gift. While
   onesies can be extremely pricey, consider purchasing bulk packs if you
   have multiple upcoming showers. Another option is to hit up your local
   dollar store – I regularly see plain onesies at mine. While they are
   not the greatest of quality, remember it doesn’t really matter as the
   baby will most likely outgrow these outfits before ever wearing it out!

   This diaper cake is by far one of the most elegant I have ever seen. I
   love all the little details from the cake topper to the leaves under
   each layer. Green is a great uni-sex color for couples who have yet to
   find out the sex of the baby, or those who are having twins. If the
   shower has a theme itself, think about using colors from the
   invitation… or use your typical pink or blue. Either way, this diaper
   cake is sure to get some attention and the mom- to- be will be
   thrilled!

   Going to a co- ed shower, need a gift for a daddy- to- be or just want
   to make the new mom laugh? This Doody Kit is hilarious! Follow the
   source link for information on all the goodies enclosed in this kit and
   more instructions on how to create it!
