​OUR SOLUTION

   Photo
   1 - SOAP COLLECTING/RECYCLING
   Photo
   Hotels collect soap left in the rooms daily to be recycled by Anacaona.
   Once a month, ANACAONA visits its hotel partners to collect this soap.
   Instead of ending up in the trash, these bars of soap are brought to
   ANACAONA's workshop to be sanitized and recycled by trained women.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 - SOAP DISTRIBUTION
   Photo
   Once the soap is recycled and repackaged by local associations, it is
   then redistributed to partner schools lacking basic hygiene supplies.
   This soap is used by the children and their teachers at the 2 key
   moments: after using the toilet and before eating... And more often if
   needed!
     __________________________________________________________________

   3 - HYGIENE EDUCATION
   Photo
   Anacaona believes that providing soap to underpriviledged schools is
   only part of the job. To increase the chances of this soap being used
   properly, ANACAONA trains and guides the teachers on basic hygiene
   lessons on a weekly basis.
   Once trained, the teachers can then properly supervise the students. An
   "Educational Hygiene Package" is provided to each partner school.
     __________________________________________________________________

   4 - WATER FILTER DISTRIBUTION
   Photo
   Although the majority of the recycled soap is distributed to partner
   schools, different bars of soap will be sold to clients willing to
   support us.
   The money collected from the sales will be used to buy ceramic water
   filters produced locally. These filters will then be distributed to
   partner schools as well as hospitals in need.
     __________________________________________________________________

   5 - TOURISM SUPPORT
   Photo
   ANACAONA is proud to support its hotel partners on our website in their
   efforts to join the Ecotourism movement. Over the years, Haitian
   tourism has proved its great potential and we believe that economic
   growth starts with building partnerships to create a cleaner, healthier
   and more equal country.

​MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE 4 REGIONS

​PORT-AU-PRINCE
The administrative and economic capital

   Port-au-Prince is the capital city of the Caribbean country of Haiti.
   With nearly 3,7 million people, the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince
   is the largest of the country and corresponds to nearly a third of
   Haiti's population. The exact number of inhabitants is however
   difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums on the
   hillsides of the city.
   On January 12th 2010, the city was severly hit by a 7.3 earthquake
   based on Richter's scale. In 2011, the Haitian Government estimates the
   final death toll to be 230,000 and the number of homeless 1.5 million.
   The economy of the city relies mainly on its production of sugar and
   coffee as well as on its textile and cement factories. Despite
   political unrest, the city also lives from a growing tourism industry.
   Port-au-Prince currently has 3 sister cities: Miami and Baton-Rouge in
   the United-States, as well as Montreal, in Quebec, Canada.

​CÔTE-DES-ARCADINS
The seaside town

   Only 45 minutes aways from Port-au-Prince, the Côte-des-Arcadins is
   famous for its white sand beaches, palm trees and numerous water
   activities.
   The city counts more than 600 rooms in 7 international
   standards « all-inclusive » hotels, including the Club Méditerranée,
   today managed by the Royal Decameron. This area is a favorite
   destination among expatriates, perfect for a getaway weekend.
   ANACAONA partners with all the hotels in the Côte-des Arcadins.

JACMEL
The craft town

   Jacmel is the biggest city in the South-East region of Haiti, famous in
   the Caribbean for its creativity and handcraft activities.
   It hosts one of the most beautiful carnival  in the Carribbean thanks
   to its numerous "papier mâché" artisans. Jacmel is the city where the
   poet and writer René Depestre was born.
   ​
   ANACAONA partners with 9 hotels in the area of Jacmel,
   including ancient houses with colonial fences, to seaside hotels,
   to riverside eco-lodges.
