CIVITAS Forum Conference 2019

October 2 - October 4

     * « Supply Chain & Logistics Summit & Expo
     * ITS Congress Belgium »

   The CIVITAS Forum Conference 2019 will be held in Graz, Austria, from
   2-4 October 2019. The 17th  Europe’s top sustainable mobility event
   will once again bring together the CIVITAS community from across Europe
   and beyond.

   The choice of Graz as the location for 2019 marks something of a
   homecoming – the very first Forum took place there in 2003.

   A little bit about Graz

   Graz is Austria’s second largest city and the capital of the Styria
   region. It has a long distinguished track record both as a member of
   CIVITAS and for embedding sustainable ideas into its urban development
   and transport systems.

   Alongside having one of Europe’s largest pedestrian zones, the city has
   rolled out its own intermodal hub system and was an early implementer
   of cycling lanes and a parking management system.

   An urban mobility lab launched in 2017 fosters systemic mobility
   solutions in combination with e-mobility and other sustainable mobility
   solutions in the Functional Urban Area of Graz.

   In recent years, Graz has participated in the CIVITAS projects SMARTSET
   (2013-2016) and NOVELOG (2015-2018).
