Privacy Policy

   Privacy Policy

   FLEXOFFERS.COM PRIVACY POLICY

   This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is effective June 9, 2018.

   FlexOffers.com, LLC (hereafter referred to as “FlexOffers.com,” “we,”
   “us,” or “our”) operates the website https://www.flexoffers.com and its
   subdomains (“Site,” “Website,” or “Websites”). We offer online
   advertising services (“Service” or “Services”) to Advertisers
   (“Clients”) and Publishers (“Vendors”) and have relationships with
   other third-party service providers. All these third parties may be
   collectively referred to as Partners within this Policy. By visiting a
   FlexOffers.com website or sharing any information with us, you agree to
   be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this
   Policy, please Contact Us.

   Our Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18, and we do
   not knowingly collect information from such persons. If you are a
   parent or guardian whose child under 18 has provided us with personal
   information without your permission, please contact us so that we can
   take steps to locate and remove that information from our servers.

   WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY
   By providing our Services, we may collect non-personally identifiable
   information (“Non-PII”) about your browser, location, operating system,
   and the device you are using to view our site and make use of our
   services. We may record what pages of our Site are viewed, time spent
   on those pages, and what actions you take while visiting those pages.
   We use this information and the services of third parties, such as
   Google Analytics, to personalize your experience and improve the
   quality and functionality of our Site’s Services.

   We do not collect personally identifying information (“PII”) such as
   name, address, phone number, or email address unless you voluntarily
   provide it to us. For example, if you submit personal information of
   any kind through our Websites to inquire about our Services or request
   support, we will use such information to reply to your inquiries. If
   you voluntarily provide your PII to become a part of a mailing list and
   later wish to be removed from such a list, you can use the
   “unsubscribe” link in those mailings or Contact Us.

   When you interact with the advertisements and services of our Clients,
   whether found on a Client or Vendor website, or our own Site, your
   Non-PII may be collected and stored in a cookie. We may assign an
   anonymous and unique identifying number to that cookie. Such “cookies”
   are files stored on your web-enabled device and are used to improve
   your experience when viewing and interacting with online advertising
   and the websites of Advertisers. We may also use these cookies to
   credit third party Vendors for helping to make you aware of the
   Client’s services, or to deliver contracted Service information to
   those Clients. Cookies are not programs and cannot install software,
   erase files, or collect PII from your device.

   If you apply for an account to use additional services (such as the
   applications to become a FlexOffers.com Advertiser or Publisher), we
   will collect additional information whose usage is described in further
   detail in the agreements governing those services.

   We may also process the Non-PII of the visitors and customers of
   websites belonging to Clients and Vendors as part of the Services we
   provide to or on behalf of those partners. The Non-PII we collect
