Brynhildr in the Darkness

   Brynhildr in the Darkness

Brynhildr in the Darkness

   Lorsqu'il était enfant, Murakami passait son temps avec une fille
   nommée Kuroneko. Celle-ci croyait en l'existence des aliens et un jour,
   elle décida de le lui prouver. Mais un accident arriva : Murakami est
   grièvement blessé et Kuroneko meurt. Les années passent, sans que
   Murakami ne puisse oublier son amie et continue de chercher des preuves
   quant à l'existence des aliens. Un jour, une jeune fille nommée Kuroha
   Neko fait son apparition en tant que nouvelle élève dans sa classe.
   Pensant son amie vivante, il la questionne, mais malgré leur troublante
   ressemblance, il s'avère que la jeune fille ne connaît pas Murakami.
   Seulement, elle lui révèle qu'un accident le concernant va bientôt
   avoir lieu...
