   CONVERGE-DIGITAL GDPR POLICY


   TYPES OF DATA COLLECTED BY CONVERGE-DIGITAL

   In order to deliver digital advertising to browsers and devices around
   the globe, the Converge-Digital Platform is designed to receive and
   transmit certain types of data, that collectively we call “Platform
   Data.” Platform Data is defined as data generated through the Platform.

   This data includes information about browsers and devices, for example:
     * The brand of browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
     * The operating system (iOS, Windows)
     * Information about other pseudonymous identifiers associated to the
       device, such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and
       Google’s Advertising ID for Android devices (GAID)
     * The IP address from the device or browser that initiates an ad
       request
     * The geographic location of the device or browser that initiates the
       ad request

   The data the Platform collects from browsers and devices may also be
   referred to as “HTTP header data”. Data contained in the HTTP header,
   (such as IP Address) is required in order to deliver an ad to a device
   or browser.

   The Converge-Digital Platform does not allow any data to be passed that
   has the potential to identify a natural person, such as name, address,
   phone number, or email address. Converge-Digital does not under allow
   data that directly identifies an individual in this way to be collected
   through or used on the Platform. We contractually prohibit our clients
   from passing data of this nature in connection with their use of our
   Platform.


   DOES THE DATA CONVERGE-DIGITAL COLLECTS QUALIFY AS “PERSONAL DATA”
   UNDER THE GDPR?

   The GDPR now includes “unique identifiers” within the scope of personal
   data when combined with certain types of information (including the
   information that we and other ad tech companies typically collect).
   This unique identifier is a sequence of numbers or numbers and letters
   used as a label that identifies a particular device or browser.

   Converge-Digital assigns a unique identifier (e.g., UUID1234) to every
   device or browser that interacts with the Platform. While
   Converge-Digital cannot identify which individual (or individuals) are
   using the device or browser in the real world, this unique identifier,
   combined with the IP Address, is now defined as “personal data”.

   This type of personal data that we collect, represented by unique
   identifiers, is referred to in the GDPR as “pseudonymized data”. The
   GDPR explicitly recognizes “pseudonymization” as good practice in
   protecting the interests of individuals, precisely because this
   practice makes it difficult, and nigh on impossible, to recognize who
   users are “in the real world”.


   CONVERGE-DIGITAL’S ROLE

   Converge-Digital is a joint controller with respect to any personal
   data collected or received by us when receiving an ad call to supply
   inventory to a publisher’s web page. This is due to the fact that data
   related to ad requests is tied to our Platform’s unique ID for the
   device or browser. Those unique IDs are used by our Platform for
   frequency capping and day-parting across browsers and apps of our
   publisher partners to ensure that advertisers using our Platform are
   not showing the same ad repeatedly to the same device or browser on the
   same day or at times the advertiser does not want to show its ad to
   that device or browser.

   We have reached the conclusion that we are a joint controller in
   relation to this data because we need to honour frequency caps for our
   Advertisers. We believe that, pursuant to the text of the GDPR and the
   existing EU guidance, this makes us a controller of the data with
   respect to that purpose.


   LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA UNDER THE GDPR

   In order to collect, use, store, pass on, etc. (known as “process”)
   personal data, a data controller must have a legal right (known as a
   “legal basis”) to use the data.


   LEGAL BASIS RELIED ON BY CONVERGE-DIGITAL

   Where Converge-Digital operates as a data controller, we rely on
   legitimate interests to process personal data on our Platform for
   security purposes, to decide which buyer (and which creative) wins an
   auction to purchase advertising inventory, and to optimize the
   real-time sale of inventory.


   All personal data used by Converge-Digital is pseudonymous data.
