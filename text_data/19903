Trader Joe's Savory Corn Pie

   [tj%2Bcorn%2Bpie.JPG]
   Ever buy something, thinking it was one thing, but come to find out,
   it's something else altogether?
   Such is the case here with Trader Joe's Savory Corn Pie.
   Yes, yes, I know, I coulda read the package or description a little
   better. Heck, even the word "pie" is kinda a big hint. But for whatever
   reason, my mind stopped reading after "Savory Corn" and my eyes focused
   instead on the picture on the package. So neat...so clean...so wedgy
   and delicious and, well, savory looking.
   It's gotta be corn bread, right?!?!?!? And on one of the first cool
   nights of fall, after the end of a long week and about to kick up the
   feet and relax and watch "Hocus Pocus" with the kids, nothing sounded
   better than a little easy to make corn bread to go with some homemade
   chili and beer. Sounds perfect.
   Except....corn pie is not corn bread. Doh!
   [tj%2Bcorn%2Bpie%2Bshot.JPG]
   I'll give you this: It definitely tastes like corn bread. There's a
   certain mealiness to it, just like a good cornbread. The pie also
   features a lot of whole kernel corn, so there's no mistaking it, it
   tastes like corn. But also a little cheddar up top, and a little light
   peppery spice, with ample saltiness...yup, if this were cornbread, it'd
   be a dang good one.
   But...it's corn pie.
   In addition to all that, there's eggs and other stuff that make this
   more like maybe a souffle or casserole. It's not quite eggy enough to
   border on quiche. So it's kinda wet and a bit watery and super dense.
   The pie is extremely filling.
   [tj%2Bcorn%2Bpie%2Binfo.JPG]
   Really, I can get over the fact that it's pie and not bread - it was my
   complete lack of simple computational understanding, after all - and
   say all in all, I enjoyed this, with one big demerit. I baked in the
   over for the recommended cook time, and when I yanked it out, the top
   and edges were brown and simmering. Mmmmm. I cut into it...and the
   middle was still cold. Thawed, yes. Ready to eat? Nah. I think we ended
   nuking some (kids were clamoring for their movie) but when I reheated
   some in the oven a few nights later, I made sure it got burny all over.
   It was much better that way. Perhaps coincidentally, it also tasted and
   felt much closer to corn bread....I digress.
   Good enough pie, good enough buy. For the roughly $3 it cost, it's a
   good value which will probably be repeated. It's a good autumnal pickup
   for sure on a cold day. There's no mistaking that.
   Bottom line: Trader Joe's Savory Corn Pie: 7 out of 10 Golden Spoons

Trader Joe's Maple & Sea Salt Kettle Corn

   [maple1.jpg]
   Seeing this product immediately makes me think of A Charlie Brown
   Thanksgiving, when they all ate popcorn and jelly beans for their
   Turkey Day dinner. I mean, I know it's The Great Pumpkin season, but
   apparently maple isn't even technically a fall food at all—it's more of
   a late winter, early spring thing. Feels fall-ish enough to me.
   Anything with colorful leaves on the packaging is autumnal as far as
   I'm concerned. Even the colors on the bag look Novemberish. And I'm
   thinking the Peanuts gang would all agree this maple kettle corn is a
   step up from plain old Pop Secret or whatever they were having.
   The kernels are remarkably large, yet light and fluffy for a candied
   popcorn. They're neither too sweet nor too salty.
   [maplec.jpg]
   The maple flavor itself isn't particularly dominant, but it's there. I
   might have preferred a wee bit more maple up in the mix—after all,
   people are going to buy this product because they want the taste of
   maple. It's what makes this popcorn treat unique.
   [maplenut.jpg]
   Trader Joe's went for a subtle taste here, not a sticky, hard-shell of
   candy or caramelesque coating. It truly is kettle corn with a hint of
   maple flavor, rather than caramel corn or candied popcorn. You can
   shovel more than a couple handfuls into your mouth without feeling a
   massive sweetness shock or getting gummy, pasty sugar stuck on your
   teeth. It's not very filling, either.
   We just happened to be sipping some Earl Grey tea with a bit of cream
   when we broke open this bag, and they paired surprisingly well as an
   afternoon snack. That earthy black tea taste helped balance out the
   moderate sweet mapley taste of the popcorn, and yet didn't drown it
   out.
   It's very much on par with the pumpkin spice and candy corn flavors
   that TJ's has rolled out in the past few years. Sonia likes it a bit
   more than its predecessors. Four and a half stars from her. I just wish
   I could taste a little more mapliciousness. Three and a half from me.
   Bottom line: 8 out of 10.

Trader Joe's Cinnamon Bun Spread

   [tj%2Bcb%2Bspread.JPG]
   It's October when I'm sitting down to write this review, but it feels
   more like July here in the Pittsburgh area.
   Temps in the 90s. Humid. Uncomfortable. Close to gaggingly gross. If
   thunderstorms are angels going bowling, maybe weather like this is when
   they leave the dishwasher open. It's gonna be another uncomfortable
   night in our well-insulated 104 year old brick oven of a house. I
   thought we were gonna be done with this by now.
   Hot. Sticky. Just about the only thing I like matching that description
   is a warm gooey cinnamon bun pulled out of the oven. If only I could
   make anything I want taste that way....
   Hey! Look! It's Trader Joe's Cinnamon Bun Spread!
   I guess spread would be the right word for this concoction. It's not
   like a jelly, jam or sauce. It's almost more like a paste, but that's
   doesn't sound nearly as appetizing. It's smooth, with the smallest
   hints of chalkiness, and absolutely gooey especially if warmed. But
   yes, spread, as it's very easily spreadable.
   And incredibly rich. Really. This is absolutely one of those "a little
   bit goes a long way" type deals. Honey is hitting leadoff on the
   ingredient list and from there: cream, butter, sugar, spices,
   vanilla...oh man. It's a lot packed in. What TJ's must be going for
   here is to try and have the brown sugar/cinnamon and vanilla sugary
   icing flavors comingling together in one concentrated take. It can all
   definitely be tasted too so savor it a bit for sure.
   It all kinda works, but still, it's a lot. One of the aspects of a
   truly great cinnamon bun IMHO is balancing and enjoying the sweet and
   savory flavors against the bready roll itself. No rolls here unless you
   supply your own. So instead it's super concentrated cinnamon bun
   flavor, and it can be a bit much...
   Not that it stops my kids from slathering it all over their freezer
   waffles in the morning for a quick and easy "breakfast treat." Spread
   it on whatever you'd like. My lovely bride enjoys putting a small
   spoonful in her coffee, which I can see working if you like flavored
   coffees. I don't really.
   Our own picture of the nutritional label turned out kinda blurry so you
   can check it here, if you dare.
   The small jar costs $3.49, and surely as this weather will pass, soon
   enough this cinnamon spread shall as well. This stuff is much more
   enjoyable though!
   Bottom line: Trader Joe's Cinnamon Bun Spread: 7.5 out of 10 Golden
   Spoons

ABOUT OUR TEAM

   Hello. My name's Nathan, and I love Trader Joe's. My wife Sonia does
   too. She's a great shopper, has excellent taste, and knows good value
   when she comes across it. As many of you know, Trader Joe's is
   unsurpassed in the world of good-value grocery stores, so we spend a
   lot of our time and money there. Although the store fairly consistently
   delivers great taste with its own unique line of food products, there
   are definitely some big-hits, and unfortunately, there are some
   misses...
   In the summer of 2010, after doing a couple of internet searches for
   reviews of TJ's food items, Sonia discerned an apparent dearth of good,
   quality reviews for the store's offerings. So, at her suggestion, we
   decided to embark on a journey of systematically reviewing every Trader
   Joe's product, resulting in the blog you are about to read...
   A couple of months into our Trader Joe's rating adventure, an old
   college friend, Russ, who unbeknownst to me had been following our TJ's
   blog, decided that I had been slacking in my blogging duties (which, of
   course, I was) so he decided to contribute his own original TJ's
   reviews to the blog, thus enhancing it, making it more complete, and
   adding to it a flavor of his own. He and his wife Sandy are also avid
   TJ's fans and, as you will soon discover, he is an excellent writer and
   is nearly as clever, witty, and humble as I am.
   Seriously though, Russ: You go, boy!
   We hope you enjoy reading What's Good at Trader Joe's!

       Nathan & Team -- can you also have a section on "Discontinued but
       Loved" products? As you may know, periodically Trader Joe's will
       discontinue products. It may be due to poor selling, but also due
       to issues with sourcing. I've seen about 4 different products that
       were favorites of mine get axed. One of them was Wasabi Mayo, which
       was actually brought back for a while, then discontinued yet again.
       I think it was due to a lack of awareness. A TJ's employee turned
       me onto it and I never would have tried it otherwise. Unfortunately
       I was smitten and had gone through 3 jars when suddenly I learned
       of the discontinuation. I wonder about how many people were also
       dismayed. Perhaps this blog could be a conduit towards getting some
       discontinued TJ's products brought back... or to help start a
       petition. :-)

       Both excellent ideas. At this point, we just focus on trying and
       reviewing as many products as possible. They best way to indicate
       which products are most loved by readers is for those readers to
       leave comments to that effect. Likewise, readers often leave
       comments that a particular item has been discontinued. It would be
       virtually impossible to keep an accurate log of which products are
       currently available since TJs discontinues and reinstates products
       at the drop of a hat. People do leave comments on reviews of
       discontinued products saying "Please bring it back!" or something
       along those lines. Not sure how much attention TJs pays to this
       blog or any others like it, but I would think if enough people are
       begging for a product to return that TJs would consider it...also
       try contacting TJs directly through their website and requesting
       the reinstatement of particular products.

       Trader Joes has been a store that produced products that were high
       quality, small packages, and good price and used healthy
       ingredients. Have been shopping at Joes for over a decade
       Slowly this started to change, most likely under profit pressures,
       to substitute better ingredients with one not as good.
       An example, the healthy sunflower and safflower oils were change to
       the genetically modified canola oil
       There is only one humus in the store that does not use canola.
       Almost any fried product has canola at Joes
       Today i saw two new products, one is the large frozen pretzels and
       small French rolls. They both use rapeseed oil. Rapeseed oil is
       poisonous by nature. It has to be treated to remove the poison. The
       rapeseed was genetically modified to remove the poison, turning it
       into canola oil, by Canada. Even when they state “organic canola
       oil”, the seeds have their origin from the poisonous variety
       Can trader Joe, not stand up to their vendors to use a high quality
       product and not be driven by maximum profit???

       I live about 5 miles from traders Joe's and I went to buy some
       Srircha seafood potstickers and when I got there I learned that
       they had discontinued it. Please please please bring them back or
       where else can I buy them?
