Hi, I’m Shannon

   In 2008, I began traveling the world. Since that day, quite a few
   things have happened. The folks at National Geographic named me
   Traveler of the Year for my work in responsible tourism (I’m still
   reeling). Millions of you found your way to this corner of the internet
   (holy cow!). And together we created an entire community with one
   common belief: A life of travel creates a story of the world worth
   telling. Thank you, and welcome to A Little Adrift.

A Little Adrift… Dispatch from Russia: Upending Cultural Assumptions

   Cold air gnawed through my layers, persistent and unrelenting. As an
   avowed lover of all things tropical—smoothie flavors, color pallets,
   and, yes, temperatures—I had dreaded exploring St. Petersburg, Russia
   in November, a month marked by gray skies, drizzling rain, and
   pervasive chill. Although my unsuitability for cold weather panned out,
   St. Petersburg upended my every…

A Little Insight… What Goes Into a Sustainable Tourism Industry?

   Around the time that I was struggling to hold down my breakfast, hiking
   at a clipped pace across the wild Kyrgyz countryside and up a mountain,
   I realized a few things needed to change. Having just finished hiking
   500 miles of Spain’s Camino de Santiago a few weeks earlier, I was fit
   enough for the…

A Little Adrift… Dispatch from Barcelona: Finding Home

   Finding a way to stop traveling has been an evolving process. When I
   booked that one-way flight ten years ago, a year of travel loomed
   before me, an epic round-the-world trip that would fulfill my dreams to
   see more of the world while also preparing me to contentedly return to
   Los Angeles at the end.…

A Little Delight… Stories of Responsible Travel in Hoi An, Vietnam

   Drizzling rain pattered on my umbrella as I wove through throngs of
   tourists, their rainbow-hued ponchos forming sudden pops of contrast
   against the canary-colored walls. I dodged locals pedaling rickety
   bicycles on the rain-drenched streets, and darted into the calm oasis
   of a local teahouse-cum-social enterprise in Hoi An, Vietnam. The rain
   hadn’t let up…

   Nearly a decade of travel. The top left is my final day as a Los
   Angeleno, and the other three are from France, Kyrgyzstan, and
   Vietnam—all places I have visited this year. To call it sadness gives
   it too much weight. But happiness is too vibrant and concrete. I don’t
   feel…

A Little Photoessay… Two Weeks of Nuance & Culture in Japan

   The chaos of Tokyo crashed over me in waves when I first landed in
   Japan. I had booked my tickets on a whim—I found an affordable
   last-minute flight and jumped at the opportunity. Luckily, I had time
   to secure a Japan Rail pass, which allowed me to zip around the country
   on the speedy Shinkansen…
