Scoop: Trump suggested nuking hurricanes to stop them from hitting U.S.

   President Trump has suggested multiple times to senior Homeland
   Security and national security officials that they explore using
   nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the United States,
   according to sources who have heard the president's private remarks and
   been briefed on a National Security Council memorandum that recorded
   those comments.

   Behind the scenes: During one hurricane briefing at the White House,
   Trump said, "I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them?" according to
   one source who was there. "They start forming off the coast of Africa,
   as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of
   the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?" the source
   added, paraphrasing the president's remarks.
     * Asked how the briefer reacted, the source recalled he said
       something to the effect of, "Sir, we'll look into that."
     * Trump replied by asking incredulously how many hurricanes the U.S.
       could handle and reiterating his suggestion that the government
       intervene before they make landfall.
     * The briefer "was knocked back on his heels," the source in the room
       added. "You could hear a gnat fart in that meeting. People were
       astonished. After the meeting ended, we thought, 'What the f---?
       What do we do with this?'"

   Trump also raised the idea in another conversation with a senior
   administration official. A 2017 NSC memo describes that second
   conversation, in which Trump asked whether the administration should
   bomb hurricanes to stop them from hitting the homeland. A source
   briefed on the NSC memo said it does not contain the word "nuclear"; it
   just says the president talked about bombing hurricanes.
     * The source added that this NSC memo captured "multiple topics, not
       just hurricanes. … It wasn't that somebody was so terrified of the
       bombing idea that they wrote it down. They just captured the
       president’s comments."
     * The sources said that Trump's "bomb the hurricanes" idea — which he
       floated early in the first year and a bit of his presidency before
       John Bolton took over as national security adviser — went nowhere
       and never entered a formal policy process.

   White House response: A senior administration official said, "We don't
   comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have
   had with his national security team."
     * A different senior administration official, who has been briefed on
       the president's hurricane bombing suggestion, defended Trump's idea
       and said it was no cause for alarm. "His goal — to keep a
       catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland — is not bad," the
       official said. "His objective is not bad."
     * "What people near the president do is they say 'I love a president
       who asks questions like that, who’s willing to ask tough
       questions.' ... It takes strong people to respond to him in the
       right way when stuff like this comes up. For me, alarm bells
       weren't going off when I heard about it, but I did think somebody
       is going to use this to feed into 'the president is crazy'
       narrative."
     * Trump called this story "ridiculous" in a Monday tweet from the G7
       summit. He added, "I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!"

   The big picture: Trump didn't invent this idea. The notion that
   detonating a nuclear bomb over the eye of a hurricane could be used to
   counteract convection currents dates to the Eisenhower era, when it was
   floated by a government scientist.
     * The idea keeps resurfacing in the public even though scientists
       agree it won't work. The myth has been so persistent that the
       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S.
       government agency that predicts changes in weather and the oceans,
       published an online fact sheet for the public under the heading
       "Tropical Cyclone Myths Page."
     * The page states: "Apart from the fact that this might not even
       alter the storm, this approach neglects the problem that the
       released radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the
       tradewinds to affect land areas and cause devastating environmental
       problems. Needless to say, this is not a good idea."

   About 3 weeks after Trump's 2016 election, National Geographic
   published an article titled, "Nuking Hurricanes: The Surprising History
   of a Really Bad Idea." It found, among other problems, that:
     * Dropping a nuclear bomb into a hurricane would be banned under the
       terms of the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty between the U.S.
       and the former Soviet Union. So that could stave off any
       experiments, as long as the U.S. observes the terms of the treaty.

   Atlantic hurricane season runs until Nov. 30.

   Editor's note: This story has been updated to include President Trump's
   tweet responding to this story.

Verizon agrees to sell Tumblr to owner of Wordpress

   Verizon is set to sell the social network Tumblr to Automattic Inc, the
   owner of online publishing tool Wordpress. A source familiar with the
   deal puts the price-tag "well below" $20 million, while another source
   puts it below $10 million.

   The big picture: Tumblr, while unprofitable, hosts more than 450
   million blogs and was once considered a major player in the social
   media space. The network was acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion in
   2013, before moving under Verizon's umbrella through the carrier's
   acquisition of Yahoo in 2017. Verizon's desire to sell Tumblr had been
   previously known, but as of May, Pornhub had been the only bidder to
   show public interest.

   Automattic Inc. will buy the network and take on its 200 employees.

   Between the lines: Tumblr has faced backlash over the years for not
   properly monitoring pornographic content, which Verizon ultimately
   banned last year. Automattic's Chief Executive Matt Mullenweg told the
   Wall Street Journal that he plans to maintain the ban.

Casinos are using AI for even greater advantage

   Casinos and gambling websites, already adept at tilting long-term odds
   in their favor, are getting a leg up from technology that could inject
   even more certainty into their profit calculations.

   The catch: Experts worry that tweaks nudging gamers to play more — and
   bet bigger — could propel some toward excess and addiction.

   The big picture: AI and data analytics are making it easier to forecast
   even the most uncertain outcomes. As we reported Monday, technology
   firms have built a massive new economy on the ability to accurately
   predict people's behavior.
     * For marketers, this means unprecedented access to the tiny,
       personalized levers that are most likely to get you — yes, you! —
       to buy or do something.
     * If you're being sold ice cream, no big deal. But for the
       millions of people with gambling problems, a lot can ride on a $50
       offer for free play or a comped hotel stay — perfectly tailored and
       timed to hit home.

   "For youth or players with serious gambling problems, the negative
   impacts of AI-based marketing and gambling operations can be
   devastating and even life-threatening," says Keith Whyte, executive
   director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.

   What's happening: Where pit bosses once kept tabs on players and doled
   out offers by feel, technology is now supercharging marketing and
   promotions that best influence each individual gambler.
     * Casinos are "tracking everything you do," says Andrew Engel,
       general manager for gaming at DataRobot, an AI startup. "They know
       how much you're in for, how much you play, how long you play, what
       types of games you like to play."
     * They've been collecting information for decades, mostly through
       longstanding loyalty programs. "It's a hell of a lot of data," says
       Anthony Chong, CEO of data analytics startup IKASI.

   Details: To entice people to spend more, casinos use their troves of
   data to tweak every aspect of the gambling experience — from marketing
   and casino layout to the incentives and freebies that get people
   through the door and then keep them inside. And a world of vendors has
   popped up to help:
     * IKASI lets casinos predict who will spend big — or lose big — and
       target them with the right incentives to keep them playing. The
       startup says it's working with regional casinos as well as a big
       chain with 20-plus locations.
     * Optimove allows casinos to fine-tune marketing campaigns, and lists
       giant chains like Caesars and MGM among its clients.
     * DataRobot lets non-experts use AI for behavioral forecasting,
       helping small casinos catch up with the giants. It can also tell
       them how to rearrange machines and table games for maximum profit.

   "From a public health perspective, this is a big concern," says Silvia
   Kairouz, director of the Lifestyle and Addiction Research Lab at
   Concordia University in Montreal.
     * "The vast majority of gamblers gamble with a budget," says James
       Whelan, co-director of the Institute of Gambling Education and
       Research at the University of Memphis.
     * But for the minority prone to gambling problems, targeted marketing
       "can be destructive," Whelan says.

   Casinos themselves are tight-lipped about their marketing and data
   science. Several declined interviews or didn't respond to requests from
   Axios.
     * But a look at what U.S.-based companies are doing in Macau, Asia's
       gambling mecca, offers a hint of what's next.
     * There, casinos are using hidden cameras, facial recognition and AI
       analytics to gauge gamblers' play and tailor incentives for each,
       Bloomberg reports.

   What they're saying: Casino defenders say the worries are overblown,
   and that analyzing playing data can help problem gamblers rather than
   hurt them.
     * "I don't believe that more efficient offers are just all of a
       sudden going to trigger problems for large numbers of people," says
       Alan Feldman, a former MGM executive who chairs the Nevada State
       Advisory Committee on Problem Gambling.
     * Several companies, like BetBuddy and Mr Green, say they can
       automatically flag problematic gambling habits based on dozens of
       risk factors and intervene.
     * "The industry is constantly exploring new and emerging
       technologies, like artificial intelligence, to gain a deeper
       understanding of our customers and provide the right resources for
       our customers to enjoy our products in a responsible manner,” says
       Elizabeth Cronan of the American Gaming Association.

Trump's trifecta

   Trump
   Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

   For the 3rd time in 4 years, President Trump has asked another country
   to interfere in U.S. elections.

   The big picture: In July 2016, Trump said Russia should "find" and
   release Hillary Clinton's emails. In July 2019, he told Ukraine to
   investigate the Biden family. And today, even as he finds himself
   embroiled in an impeachment inquiry over this very issue, Trump said
   that China, too, should investigate the Bidens.
   Go deeper188 Words

   Why it matters: It's not normal for presidents to solicit foreign
   interference in our elections. It's also against the law, as Federal
   Elections Commission chair Ellen Weintraub tweeted today.

   Between the lines: Trump and Rudy Giuliani have been promoting
   allegations that Hunter Biden made "millions" in China by leveraging
   his father's name.
     * In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters accompanied
       Joe Biden to China on a diplomatic trip. During the trip, Hunter
       helped organize a handshake between his father and business partner
       Jonathan Li, who was the CEO of a Chinese investment firm.
     * 12 days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a private-equity
       fund created by Li and another of Biden's business partners called
       BHR.
     * A lawyer for Biden told the Washington Post: "To date, Mr. Biden
       has not received any return or compensation on account of this
       investment or his position on the board of directors."

   The bottom line: Trump is already facing an impeachment inquiry for the
   Ukraine call. Now he's saying it out loud with China — effectively
   challenging Congress.

  IPO misery

   The ad has “For Sale IPO"

   Illustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios

   Once upon a time, going public was a fun and joyous thing to do. In the
   late 1990s, young companies would raise money in an IPO, there would be
   an enormous first-day pop, everybody would start talking about you, and
   the combination of new money and free PR would turbocharge your
   business.

   Flash forward: Today, it's hard to find anybody who's happy with way
   that companies transition from being private to being public. Even the
   institutional clients of the large investment banks, who can get
   significant allocations of coveted IPOs, are feeling the pain.
   Companies like Uber and Peloton have never traded above their IPO
   price.
   Go deeper362 Words

   Driving the news: Venture capitalists are so unhappy with IPOs that
   they spent Tuesday at a high-level conference devoted to direct
   listings — a slightly different way of going public, that doesn't
   involve raising money.
     * But direct listings solve none of the problems of being a public
       company — not just Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and other bureaucratic
       overheads, but, more deeply, the feeling that you're constantly
       trying to do your work with second-guessers peering over your
       shoulder who could seize the company at any time.
     * The highest-profile direct listing to date, Slack, has traded
       miserably as a public company. Early trades were above $40 per
       share, but now it's trading at about $23.
     * Once you're public, everybody starts to judge you by your share
       price, over which you have very little control. Private companies
       can refuse to sell stock at a level lower than they think it's
       worth, but public companies have no such power to dictate
       valuations.

   Being public is so miserable that people like the Chang family, who
   founded retailer Forever 21, refused to raise equity capital.
     * When they expanded using only debt instead, they found themselves
       overlevered and were forced this week to file for bankruptcy
       protection. It's not clear that bankruptcy is worse for them than
       the specter of quarterly earnings reports and activist
       shareholders.

   The bottom line: In 2012, I wrote a feature for Wired about "why going
   public sucks," and suggested that maybe the answer might lie in
   companies staying private instead, orchestrating deals on their own
   terms to provide liquidity to investors and employees who need it.
     * That never really happened. The market leader in terms of matching
       buyers and sellers of private-company stock was SecondMarket. They
       ended up being bought by Nasdaq, which obviously has an interest in
       maximizing the number of IPOs.
     * If you have employees and investors who own stock, then they need
       to be able to sell that stock at some point. So far, no one's come
       up with a good long-term way of allowing them to (a) sell their
       equity, while (b) managing to avoid the public markets altogether.
