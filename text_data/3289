   loved their trip to Albania
     __________________________________________________________________

   We spent four days walking the Accursed Mountains in Albania and
   Kosovo. We were provided with a guide who himself had been born and
   bred in Albania. Not only was he able to guide us on the walks, but he
   had a thorough local knowledge of the flairs and fauna, as well as the
   cultural customs of the local people. Whilst the walks we did could be
   quite strenuous, the scenery and the shepherds huts we stayed in made
   it all worth while. The Albanian hospitality was second to none, and
   the food some of the best we have ever eaten. At the end of the holiday
   we felt a huge sense of achievement and it has certainly raised the bar
   for future trips. We cannot thank enough Ed and his team from *** - and
   in particular a big thanks to Nic our guide, Mephmut the horse handler
   and Dorri the horse (who carried our bags).

   Best parts:
   Our local agent were very quick to respond to my enquiry about doing a
   walking holiday in Albania I told them the type of walking we were
   looking for and they built a bespoke programme for us, tweaking it
   following feedback from us. By going via a local agent like ***, we
   felt like we were in the hands of an agency that has first hand
   knowledge of the country. They even went above and beyond expectations
   by providing helpful information about locations to take the second
   part of our holiday. It was also good to be picked up from the airport
   when we arrived.
   Worst parts:
   There were no worst parts.

     __________________________________________________________________

   We did 5 countries in a 15 day road trip, so the program was well
   loaded. However we managed to see all we wanted to see. Starting in
   Tirana, we then drove up to Shkoder, crossed into Montenegro to Budva
   and Kotor. From there onwards to Bosnia where we visited Mostar and
   Sarajevo. We then moved back into Montenegro and Kosovo. From Peja we
   moved into Macedonia, saw Skopje and Ohrid and back into the southern
   part of Albania.

   Best parts:
   As this was a multiple country trip I was struggling to find a rental
   car that I could bring around. Going through Evaneos solved this
   problem. Furthermore we had generally well located hotels, not sure we
   could have found the right locations ourselves. The trip itself was
   stunning, hitting all the right spots, and required some active
   driving. All in all good fun.
   Worst parts:
   Generally all hotels were good or better than good, we had 2 hotels
   however that were a bit on the simple side, I would have paid a bit
   more for a slightly better hotel. Also in 2 or 3 of the hotels there
   were challenges with reservations and payments that needed sorting out.

   loved their trip to Albania
     __________________________________________________________________

   We knew very little about Albania but have friends who lived and worked
   there for several years. After talking to them our interest was piqued
   about this country that was isolated from the rest of the world until
   recently. It did not concern us that the tourist infrastructure is in
   it's infancy because we found the hospitality and friendliness of the
   Albanians to override any small inconveniences. And there are some
   excellent hotels and restaurants that would rival those in more visited
   destinations.

   Best parts:
   My husband and I spent two weeks in Albania with' our local
   agency...Europe's Last Adventure'. Planning the trip was very easy as
   Ed, the owner, answered our emails and questions immediately and
   together with his knowledge and our special requests to visit/see
   certain places, Ed created an exciting itinerary. We credit Henri, our
   driver/guide (and who soon became our friend) with the success of our
   trip. His English is excellent, his knowledge of Albania and the sites
   we visited was extensive, he is an excellent and safe driver and he is
   very friendly and engaging person. If you want to explore a beautiful
   country, rich in culture and and wilderness experiences, go to Albania.
   It is not inundated with tourists. The people are hospitable and kind
   and the food is excellent. It is a gem!
   Worst parts:
   If you don't like cigarette smoke you might find Albania difficult.
   Cigarettes are cheap and it seems as though most males smoke. Although
   there are laws about smoking in restaurants, they are often not
   enforced. If you are afraid of heights and narrow, high roads you might
   be nervous as 80% of Albania is mountains. Obviously, neither of these
   issues have anything to do with 'Drive Albania'.....I can't identify
   any problems with our tour and the the staff.
   Ed
   Agency's comment
   Ed
   Thanks so much, Nancy - we're really glad you enjoyed your time with
   us, and in Albania generally! I know Henri had a fun time too. Hope you
   can make it back one day - there's still a lot to discover!...Thanks so
   much, Nancy - we're really glad you enjoyed your time with us, and in
   Albania generally! I know Henri had a fun time too. Hope you can make
   it back one day - there's still a lot to discover! Best, Ed ReevesSee

   friendly, food delicious, and facilities are all good.

   Best parts:
   Visited a wide variety of landscapes and sites thus getting a great
   overview of the country. No excessively long road trips were involved.
   Really great guide who did her very best to ensure that we had an
   excellent tour. All of the accommodation and meals were fine, and of a
   high standard. Managed to see a reasonable selection of birdlife.
   Overall a really great trip, and your assistance in achieving this was
   much appreciated
   Worst parts:
   Our vehicle was designed in such a way that it was impossible to open
   the passenger doors from inside; the driver had to get out of the
   vehicle in order to open the doors (rather like a police car). Also, it
   was not possible to open any rear windows. This created a bit of a
   problem and was somewhat unsafe, and I strongly recommend that vehicles
   should have doors that can be opened from inside, also openable rear
   windows.

   loved their trip to Armenia
     __________________________________________________________________

   Well balanced and organised trip by the local agent in Armenia +
   flexibility of the guide and driver to adapt the program in function of
   the weather conditions or religious celebration. As the trip in Armenia
   went so well, we had high expectations when we arrived in Georgia but
   we were disappointed by the organisation of the trip.

   Best parts:
   Landscapes, visits, food (in particular lunch with locals in Armenia),
   our guide and driver, the people (especially in Armenia)
   Worst parts:
   Georgia: we realised once arrived that it was Easter (orthodox) and
   that some sites were close and that we had to cancel some visits. We
   are disappointed in the organisation as we feel that it could have been
   avoided (we planned this trip months ago and the local agent should
   have checked and told us what was possible/not possible to visit during
   Easter) Accommodation: lack of information about the type of room
   booked (ie no window in Tbilissi)

   Michele, Thanks for sharing your impressions with us. I'm glad you've
   enjoyed the Armenian part of the trip. I found out that you've missed
   only Uplistikhe and have visited another cultural place. It was the
   first time Uplistikhe was closed because of the Easter and none of the
   travel agencies was informed about it. I'm sorry for the room without
   window at the hotel in Tbilisi. We've already passed your feedback to
   the hotel's administration. We would have asked them to change the room
   immediately if you had informed us about it. Well, hope you'll keep
   good memories from the trip! Wish you all the best!See more
