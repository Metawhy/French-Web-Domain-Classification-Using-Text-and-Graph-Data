Why do we need QUIET MARK?

   Does it really matter if our appliances are quieter? The World Health
   Organisation research on Noise Effects and Morbidity believes it is
   crucial. It says; ‘Environmental noise acts as a stress, at night by
   disturbing sleep, and via annoyance during the day… With chronically
   strong annoyance, a causal chain may exist between the three steps:
   health-annoyance-disease’. So it is extremely important to carefully
   consider the collection of machines we surround ourselves with. A
   desirable appliance must not only look good, but needs to be efficient
   and have a pleasant sound quality. An appliance instantly becomes
   unwelcome if its starts to dominate.

   With the trend for open plan living and quest for light and space,
   replacing curtains and carpets with hard floor surfaces and shutters
   has brought a whole set of new challenges and created a more complex
   and noisier domestic soundscape.

What is QUIET MARK?

   “I couldn't hear my baby crying over the noise of the hairdryer”

   Quiet Mark is the international approval award programme associated
   with the UK Noise Abatement Society charitable foundation. It
   encourages companies worldwide to prioritise noise reduction within the
   design of everyday machines and appliances, and find solutions to noise
   problems.

   Through scientific testing and assessment, we can identify the quietest
   products in a given category, making purchase decisions quicker and
   easier. The more successful the scheme becomes, the more designers and
   manufacturers will be driven to reduce sound levels in their next
   generation of product.

Control the sound
in your life

   What is clearly understood is that when one is exposed to loud,
   unexpected noise, or low continual sound vibration, strong physical and
   emotional responses are triggered, depending on the volume, length of
   time and the sound quality and context. We all know what sounds we like
   and which ones we hate.

   For this reason, Quiet Mark does not mention any specific decibel
   levels relating to tested products, as every different environment they
   are used in will subtly influence how the sound is perceived. Our
   scheme compares products like-for-like in the same environment, and
   identifies the ones that are quieter than their peers.

   "Your washing machine no longer has to sound like a train coming
   through your kitchen"

Is my information private with Business merchants and advertisers?

   The Business web site may contain links to various 3rd-party web sites
   and the external web sites of our advertisers and/or 3rd-party
   partners. Each of these web sites may have a privacy policy that
   differs from that of the Business. This Policy does not cover the
   privacy policies of other web sites. We urge you to check the privacy
   policies of each web site that you may visit or interact with.

   Order information, including order numbers and amounts, may be
   available to the Business, affiliate merchants and 3rd-party affiliate
   program management companies, for accurate tracking purposes. The
   Business will not release this information to other parties unless you
   request it.

   The Business provides banner and other advertising on its web site,
   from Google and other third parties, that may place and read cookies on
   your browser, or use web beacons to collect information in the course
   of advertisements being served. If you are concerned about your privacy
   regarding these advertisements, please refer to Google’s (or other
   third party) privacy policies.

What about data security?

   We employ security measures to protect, so far as reasonably possible,
   your information from access by unauthorised persons and against
   unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will
   retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law
   requires or permits.

   The Business requires that our advertisers and partners ensure the
   security of the data that users provide to them, however, in the event
   of a breach of their security measures, you agree that the Business
   will not be liable for any losses or damages.

   The Business limits access to personal information about users to
   employees, for whom we reasonably believe it is necessary, in order to
   provide products or services.

How do we store your data?

   We generally use external third parties based within the European
   Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will not
   involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

   Where we contract with external third parties with an international
   base, we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
   been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
   data by the European Commission.

   Where we contract with providers based in the US, we may transfer data
   to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
   provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and
   the US. This includes FreshMail, G-Suite and Google Drive.

May I see the information the Business collects about me?

   You are entitled to see the personal information held about you and you
   may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that it is accurate
   and kept up to date. If you wish to do this, please contact us at
   [email protected] We do not raise any charge in providing you with
   details of the information we hold about you, but we may raise a charge
   where such requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in
   particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge
   a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of
   providing the information or communication or taking the action
   requested or refuse to act on the request.

Can I Opt-out?

   The Business gives users the option to remove personally identifiable
   information from our list of active users.

   You may also choose to opt-out of certain communications from the
   Business, such as our Newsletter.

   If you want to unsubscribe or opt-out of communications from us, send
   an email to Customer Service at [email protected] We will respond
   within 48 hours.

   The Business is not responsible for removing personally identifiable
   information from the lists of any 3rd-party partner or advertiser who
   has previously been provided your information in accordance with this
   Policy.
