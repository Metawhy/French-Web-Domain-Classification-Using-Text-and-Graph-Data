How Will Marvel Universe Move on Without Spider-Man?

   Sony has complete control of Peter Parker again, which makes a Venom
   crossover much more likely in the future.

   How do you solve a problem like Peter Parker? News broke Tuesday that
   Sony and Marvel Studios have split and will no longer work on future
   Spider-Man films together. Sony and Marvel's falling out doesn’t just
   mean that Kevin Feige won’t get a producer credit on any future
   Spider-Man movies; it almost certainly means that Tom Holland’s version
   of the wall-crawler is going to be absent from the Marvel Cinematic
   Universe effective immediately, despite both studios having spent the
   last three years ensuring that Spider-Man is a central part of what
   audiences think of when they think “Marvel.”

   Ultimately, this is far more of a problem for Marvel than it is for
   Sony; for all that the latter might lose the cache of having an MCU
   cameo or two in future Spider-Man movies — or, more importantly, the
   certainty of the Marvel Studios creative touch — it would be easy
   enough for Sony’s future Spider-Man movies to just never mention the
   Avengers anymore, or refer to characters and events indirectly to keep
   IP lawyers from getting too jittery.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   Additionally, bringing Spider-Man back to a prospective Sonyverse means
   that the possibility of his meeting Tom Hardy’s Venom, or Jared Leto’s
   Morbius, currently in production, has just significantly increased,
   much to the delight of internet meme makers everywhere.

   For those nervous that losing Marvel from the Spidey moviemaking
   decision process — not the most unreasonable response, considering the
   confused state of Sony’s Spider-slate before the Marvel partnership was
   announced in early 2015 — let’s remember that Spider-Man: Into the
   Spider-Verse writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller are already
   developing new Spider-Man ideas for Sony, albeit the TV side. How
   difficult would it be to get them to start thinking of more big-screen
   ideas, too…?

   For Marvel, however, there’s a bit more of a problem. Since his
   introduction in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man has been
   an increasingly integral part of the MCU. Outside of his two solo
   movies since then, he was also one of the most visible characters in
   Avengers: Infinity War, and his death in that movie proved to be one of
   the primary motivators for Tony Stark’s actions in Avengers: Endgame
   the following year. The most recent solo pic, Spider-Man: Far From
   Home, not only was responsible for introducing the new status quo of
   the MCU, but it also seemed to tease the next big multi-movie storyline
   for Marvel Studios. Spider-Man, it was clear, was very important to the
   MCU.

   And now, he won’t be there.

   On the one hand, this won’t be an immediate problem for Marvel — note
   that there was no Spider-Man movie announced as part of Marvel’s Phase
   IV at San Diego Comic-Con last month — but on the other… How, exactly,
   is Marvel going to dance around the fact that it can no longer feature
   the character who — in the very last Marvel movie released — was the
   face of the MCU superheroes?

   It could, of course, simply not mention him and hope that everyone in
   the audience understands why, but that seems like a somewhat risky move
   given the vocal demands of the fan base. There’s the potential for some
   comic, cosmic switcheroo storyline that literally replaces Spider-Man
   with characters from the Fantastic Four or X-Men franchises, which
   would arguably give those introductions additional narrative weight
   (and could explain why no one has heard of those characters to this
   point).

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tvAjX5ACPo

   Perhaps this is too premature. In 2012, as The Avengers were hitting
   the big screen, it seemed unthinkable that Spider-Man would be joining
   them in a Civil War movie four years later. Perhaps Sony and Marvel
   will make peace and craft a deal to maintain the integrity of the MCU,
   such as it is. But if not, don’t be too surprised if the fifth Avengers
   movie opens with Doctor Strange looking at an indistinct corpse in a
   mortuary and commenting that, yes, it’s Peter and it’s such a shame
   that the accident left him utterly unrecognizable and he’ll be an
   inspiration to everyone moving forward. It’s what he would have wanted.

Viacom Acquires Free Streaming Platform Pluto TV for $340 Million

   Viacom CEO Bob Bakish

Pluto has more than 12 million monthly active users for its lean-back
streaming video platform.

   As its competitors rush to launch Netflix-style subscription streaming
   services, Viacom is making a bet on free programming.

   The company is paying $340 million in cash to acquire free streaming
   service Pluto TV, which it plans to use as a distribution outlet for
   digital programming from brands like Awesomeness and as a marketing
   tool for its portfolio of media brands. The deal is expected to close
   during the first quarter of the year.

   "As the video marketplace continues to segment, we see an opportunity
   to support the ecosystem in creating products at a broad range of price
   points, including free," CEO Bob Bakish said Tuesday in a statement
   announcing the purchase. "To that end, we see significant white space
   in the ad-supported streaming market and are excited to work with the
   talented Pluto TV team, and a broad range of Viacom partners, to
   accelerate its growth in the U.S. and all over the world."

   Founded in 2013, Pluto TV was created with the premise that, despite
   the on-demand nature of streaming services like Netflix or YouTube,
   consumers were still looking for a lean-back experience. It licensed
   shortform digital programming primarily from YouTube and curated the
   videos into channels based on a specific genre or brand. Over time, it
   began to license films and television shows from the major Hollywood
   studios and organized them into customized channels like Pluto TV
   Movies or TV Drama. Today, Pluto offers more than 100 channels
   featuring programming from more than 130 partners. The company, which
   is said to have a $200 million run rate, claims an audience of 12
   million monthly active users, two-thirds of whom watch via connected
   TVs.

   "Since our launch less than five years ago, and particularly over the
   past year, Pluto TV has enjoyed explosive growth and become the
   category leader in free streaming television," said Pluto TV co-founder
   and CEO Tom Ryan. "Viacom's portfolio of global, iconic brands and IP,
   advanced advertising leadership and international reach will enable
   Pluto TV to grow even faster and become a major force in streaming TV
   worldwide. Viacom is the perfect partner to help us accomplish our
   mission of entertaining the planet."

   Viacom, which has been steadily building up a digital business through
   the acquisitions of influencer marketing platform WhoSay and digital
   producer Awesomeness, sees an opportunity to utilize Pluto to reach
   consumers directly and use it as an entry point for subscription
   businesses Noggin and Comedy Central Now. Further, it will connect
   Viacom with a predominantly young, tech-driven viewership that largely
   isn't paying for cable, where it primarily distributes networks like
   MTV and BET.

   The deal comes during a pivotal moment for legacy media companies.
   Disney, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal are all currently working on
   streaming services that will help them not only take on Netflix but
   also allow them to create a direct relationship with consumers as cable
   subscriptions decline. Acquiring Pluto will give Viacom the opportunity
   to experiment with streaming video without going all-in on a
   subscription business. The company says that the deal will not disrupt
   its existing pay TV relationships.

'Game of Thrones' Creators Close $200M Netflix Overall Deal

In this story

   Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Netflix Netflix
   David Benioff and Dan Weiss have signed a multiyear film and TV pact
   with the streamer, which was bidding for the duo's services alongside
   Disney and Amazon.

   Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss officially have a
   new home.

   The duo have signed what sources say is a $200 million multiyear
   overall film and TV deal with Netflix. Under the pact, Benioff and
   Weiss will depart their longtime home at HBO and create and develop new
   projects for the streaming giant.

   "We are thrilled to welcome master storytellers David Benioff and Dan
   Weiss to Netflix. They are a creative force and have delighted
   audiences worldwide with their epic storytelling. We can’t wait to see
   what their imaginations will bring to our members," Netflix chief
   content officer Ted Sarandos said Wednesday in a statement.

   Added Benioff and Weiss in a joint statement: "We’ve had a beautiful
   run with HBO for more than a decade and we’re grateful to everyone
   there for always making us feel at home. Over the past few months we’ve
   spent many hours talking to Cindy Holland and Peter Friedlander, as
   well as Ted Sarandos and Scott Stuber. We remember the same shots from
   the same '80s movies; we love the same books; we’re excited about the
   same storytelling possibilities. Netflix has built something astounding
   and unprecedented, and we're honored they invited us to join them."

   Benioff and Weiss, who created and served as showrunners on HBO's
   megahit Game of Thrones, were also in discussions with Disney (and its
   newly owned cable network FX) and Amazon, and came to their decision
   after extensive talks with Netflix.

   Sources say Amazon Studios had been the front-runner until early July,
   when Netflix re-emerged with a competitive offer. Disney had also
   entered the conversation more recently, as some said the new
   super-sized Mouse House might have been offering a TV deal with FX
   Productions to go alongside a film pact with the company. Benioff and
   Weiss are already in business with Disney, working on a Star Wars
   trilogy for Disney-owned Lucasfilm.

   Sources say Benioff and Weiss were seeking a deal worth as much as $200
   million as they attempt to surpass the $150 million pact Westworld
   creators Lisa Joy and Jonah Nolan signed with Amazon in April. Joy and
   Nolan's five-year agreement is estimated to be worth in the
   $30-million-per-year territory. When factoring in payouts from Warner
   Bros. TV to remain showrunners on three additional seasons of HBO's
   Westworld, Joy and Nolan's deal clocks in at $200 million.

   Heat around Benioff and Weiss — who fired their longtime reps at
   Management 360 as they sought a new deal — ramped up this summer and
   reached a fever pitch after Game of Thrones set a new Emmy record for
   the most nominations by a single program in one year (32). The pair had
   quietly begun canvassing the marketplace earlier this year, taking
   meetings with media titans including HBO parent WarnerMedia (which is
   in final negotiations for a $500 million pact with J.J. Abrams' Bad
   Robot), Disney, Comcast, Amazon and Apple.

   Benioff and Weiss, with Game of Thrones now in the rearview mirror,
   were said to want to focus on building up their company. Any new deal
   with the duo was considered likely have to include overhead costs to
   set up a production company. The bigger question about Benioff and
   Weiss is going to be just when they would have time to focus on new
   projects, given their commitment to writing a Star Wars trilogy for
   Disney.

   The first pic in their trilogy has already been earmarked for a Dec.
   16, 2022, release date. (Two subsequent Star Wars features have also
   been dated — for December 2024 and December 2026 — though it's unclear
   which, if any of these, are from Benioff and Weiss or Rian Johnson, who
   is also developing a second trilogy for Lucasfilm.)

   Still, Star Wars was always poised to take priority over their
   previously announced projects at HBO. Benioff and Weiss were set to
   write and serve as showrunners on Confederate, the straight-to-series
   drama alongside Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified, The Good Wife)
   and Malcolm Spellman (Empire). The show — which takes place in an
   alternate timeline where the Southern states have successfully seceded
   from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal
   and has evolved into a modern institution — immediately drew
   controversy. That series was eyed to launch in either 2018 or 2019,
   after Benioff and Weiss completed their work on the final season of
   Thrones. Following the backlash, the project was shelved indefinitely.
   Their new overall with Netflix wipes Confederate off HBO's books.

   Sources say HBO — the duo's longtime home for the past decade — met
   with Benioff and Weiss' legal teams and quickly determined that they
   did not want to compete to keep them given the size of the deal and
   their looming commitment to Star Wars. Still, the two will be credited
   as executive producers on any and all Game of Thrones prequel series,
   though they declined to be involved in any sort of hands-on capacity
   with any of the scripts currently in development/at the pilot stage.
   (HBO programming president Casey Bloys told reporters this week that
   production on the prequel pilot has been completed.)

   "They're meeting everywhere, which I totally get," Bloys told The
   Hollywood Reporter in May after the Game of Thrones series finale.
   "It's a great time to be a creator. People are throwing open doors and
   throwing money around. So if you're a creator with a proven track
   record, it's a great time. I think they're doing the right thing and
   seeing what's out there. We obviously have a strong relationship with
   them; Warner Bros. has worked with them both individually in the past.
   We'll see where they end up. Obviously, we think they're great. They're
   going through the process they should go through."

   As for Netflix, the free-spending streamer that upended the market for
   overall deals, is fresh off a sour earnings quarter that saw it shed
   subscribers and miss its projections. Netflix has been making a wave of
   scripted cancellations (The O.A., Chambers, She's Gotta Have It,
   Designated Survivor, Tuca and Bertie) as it weighs the cost of new
   programs against returning seasons and which of those two is more
   attractive to potential new subscribers. The company already has deals
   with mega-producers Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes and Kenya Barris, among
   others, across multiple programming genres.

   Benioff and Weiss are repped by Hansen Jacobson.

Wealth, Privilege and Gwyneth Paltrow: How Ryan Murphy's First Netflix Show
Takes Down Trump-Era Entitlement

   by Bryn Elise Sandberg

   August 07, 2019, 6:00am PDT

'The Politician,' also starring Ben Platt, Zoey Deutch and Jessica Lange,
eviscerates the absurd lengths the .001  percent will go to stay on top — and
the writers even predicted the college cheating scandal: "It is about the
ugliest thing someone of means can do."

   Midway through the first episode of Ryan Murphy's debut Netflix series,
   The Politician, Ben Platt's Tracy Flick-esque character finds out he's
   been wait-listed at Harvard, his dream school and an essential pit stop
   on his meticulously plotted journey to the White House. He's venting to
   his adoptive mom, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who's wearing a bright-red
   Carolina Herrera gown as she cuts the roses in their sprawling,
   perfectly manicured California garden, about how unfair it is that his
   considerably less impressive older brothers got in.

   "Well," says Paltrow, matter-of-factly, "your father and I bought their
   way in."

   At first, the line seems like a playful nod to the college admissions
   cheating scandal, the spectacle of privilege that saw 50 parents,
   including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, arrested
   earlier this year for allegedly bribing their kids' way into top-tier
   universities. But what most viewers won't know when the eight-episode
   series premieres Sept. 27 is that the scene was written by Murphy and
   his Politician co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, the trio
   behind Glee and Scream Queens, eight months before Operation Varsity
   Blues captivated the nation.

   "We lucked into that," says Murphy, tucked into a corner couch in his
   trailer on the Sunset Gower lot, where he's adapting his Tony-winning
   Broadway staging of Boys in the Band — among the 12 projects he's
   juggling — as a movie for Netflix. It's not the first time Murphy has
   had an eerie premonition in one of his shows, either. It happened with
   the "Nor'easter" episode in the second season of American Horror Story,
   which aired two days after Hurricane Sandy made landfall, and on a
   later season of Nip/Tuck, when a line seemingly alluding to a Tiger
   Woods sex scandal was written well before the golfer's extramarital
   affairs were public knowledge. Psychics have even told the showrunner
   that his astrological sign bestows him with prophetic abilities. He's a
   triple Scorpio, if you're into that sort of thing — which he isn't.

   Of the growing list of creators Netflix has poached from traditional
   studios with jaw-dropping deals (Shonda Rhimes, Kenya Barris), Murphy
   is the first to actually launch a Netflix original, albeit one that was
   picked up under his previous pact and is thus produced by Fox 21
   Television Studios. "Ryan likes to move fast," says Netflix vp original
   content Cindy Holland, who notes that he came in eager to set up a
   cadre of projects after inking his landmark $300 million deal in
   February 2018. "I felt an obligation. If you're going to get that kind
   of deal, I wanted to be like, 'Let's get to it,' " says Murphy. "And I
   live for the drops," he adds, ticking off Stranger Things and
   Mindhunter as his most anticipated of the year. "I was like, 'I want to
   be a part of that.' " There's considerable interest around how The
   Politician might fare — in terms of viewership numbers (which, given
   Netflix's tradition of withholding, may never be widely known) as well
   as its ability to capture the zeitgeist the way Murphy's Fox and FX
   shows routinely have. Netflix is betting the showrunner's knack for
   having his finger on the societal pulse will pay off. Says Holland, "I
   think people are interested in these cultural conversations about class
   and privilege."

   To hear Murphy tell it, The Politician is a class takedown in the vein
   of such satirical 1970s films as The Candidate and Shampoo — but with a
   modern, Trumpy twist. "It's wealthy people behaving badly," he says.
   "All of this has been percolating in the culture, particularly under
   this president and this idea of Ivanka and Jared [as] the sort of
   satanic poster boy and girl for privilege and nepotism." In fact, the
   president's son-in-law's curious acceptance into Harvard was the chief
   inspiration for the show's storyline. Falchuk, 48, was fascinated by
   reports that Kushner's real estate developer father had pledged $2.5
   million to Harvard before his son was admitted. "This guy was walking
   around with the pride of being a Harvard graduate, and the reality was
   that he didn't belong there," recalls Falchuk, who married Paltrow in
   September. "I said, 'We've got to tell that story.' " It's why the
   show, which takes place in an affluent, comically liberal area of Santa
   Barbara, centers on a young man determined to become the president of
   the United States — on his own merit.

   The writers' own brushes with privilege were always in the background,
   too. While Murphy, Falchuk and Brennan all came to Hollywood with solid
   educations, none attended Ivy League universities. "We've talked a lot
   about a group of writers in Hollywood — the Yale guys, the Harvard guys
   — and we've always been curious about, like, 'What is that like?' "
   says Murphy, who worked three jobs to put himself through school at
   Indiana University Bloomington. "We were kind of satirizing that." That
   all three are dads at various stages of getting their own children into
   schools only made the scandal more eye-opening. "I want to slap every
   one of those people because nobody took my SATs for me," says Brennan,
   41, of the indicted parents. "It's such a gross thing and it drives me
   fucking nuts. It is about the ugliest thing that someone of means can
   do, and it's not a good look for this town."

   While Murphy may have had inklings that the growing epidemic of
   unchecked privilege eventually would give way to a cultural reckoning,
   what he couldn't predict is that people he knew would become embroiled
   in the scandal. Though he's never worked with Loughlin or Huffman, he
   does consider the latter a friend. "It's a sensitive thing," says
   Murphy, whose two boys with photographer husband David Miller are 4 and
   6. "Do I agree with what they did? No. Do I understand what they did?
   Yes. I think it's all out of a love of your child, and I think that the
   system has gone so crazy," adds Murphy of Huffman, who pleaded guilty
   to paying $15,000 to doctor her daughter's SAT scores. "I have always
   liked her — and I believe in redemption and in second chances."
   Pervasive internet rumors aside, there are no plans for American Crime
   Story: College Cheating Scandal. "I will not be doing that," he says
   flatly.

   Unlike his Crime Story anthology, based on real-life events, The
   Politician isn't designed to be so literal. The plan is for each of the
   seasons, initially envisioned as five, to follow Platt's fictional
   character, Payton Hobart, as he runs in a different election, from
   student government to the presidency. "It's not a show on current U.S.
   politics. It's more about the phenomenon of what it takes to be a
   politician and how much of yourself you have to sacrifice to be a good
   one," says Platt, who is starring in his first series after a
   Tony-winning role in Broadway's Dear Evan Hansen. Though the name
   Donald Trump is never uttered, some real-life politicians are infused
   into Platt's character. Among them: Obama, Nixon and Alexandria
   Ocasio-Cortez. "Enough with the baby boomers [in American politics].
   Like, bye-bye," says Murphy, who at 53 is at the very tail end of that
   generation and eager for a changing of the guard. "You can see that
   people get excited by young people like AOC. You may love her, you may
   hate her, but she is an exciting figure because she is the future,"
   says the showrunner, whose dream 2020 ticket is Kamala Harris and Pete
   Buttigieg. "That's what I'm trying to write about."

   ***

   Murphy had been itching to write something about ambition — his, in
   particular — for some time. "My ambition has always been …" he pauses,
   " 'sociopathic' is too strong of a word — but maybe not." The ideal
   vehicle for the concept, though, was always fuzzy. That is, until he
   discovered Platt in Dear Evan Hansen in spring 2017. "I had never seen
   a male actor able to be vulnerable and accessible and neurotic," he
   says. "Usually it's women who do that brilliantly." Murphy immediately
   thought of Barbra Streisand, who was actually attached to The
   Politician at one point. "Ben is that kind of figure. And also, like
   Barbra, very ambitious." The 25-year-old actor-singer was tired of
   playing the sweet, nerdy, wallflower-y teen he had been in Hansen, Book
   of Mormon and Pitch Perfect. He wanted desperately to sink his teeth
   into someone confident, dark, sexual and, yes, ambitious. "As soon as
   he told me that, it clocked me into those ideas that I had [for this
   project]," recalls Murphy.

   Platt, who grew up in Beverly Hills as the fourth of film and theater
   producer Marc Platt's five children, wasn't exactly a stranger to the
   kind of rarefied world that The Politician skewers. "It's a lot of very
   privileged wealthy white people, and I think now is the time to take a
   blackhearted look at that," he says. Paltrow, herself the daughter of
   Hollywood royalty Blythe Danner and the late director Bruce Paltrow,
   says the cheating scandal is emblematic of the problems with excess
   wealth, something her husband has strong views on. "Brad really doesn't
   believe in accruing generational wealth like that … because he feels
   like it keeps this vast difference between segments of the population,"
   she says. "He's very progressive like that."

   20th shopped the show around town in late 2017, sparking a fierce
   bidding war. What the competition didn't know was that Netflix execs
   Ted Sarandos and Holland had a considerable leg up: Not only had they
   already snagged Murphy's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest prequel,
   Ratched, starring Sarah Paulson, but they also were in the process of
   wooing him with a staggering nine-figure overall pact. For Murphy, what
   ultimately sealed the deal on Politician was a dinner he had around
   that time with Holland and Brian Wright, the Netflix exec shepherding
   the streamer's young-adult shows. Wright, who counts Stranger Things
   and 13 Reasons Why among his stable, was regaling Murphy with details
   of how those programs racked up tens of millions of views and how The
   Politician, were it on their service, could do the same. After all,
   high school-set shows with broader themes, according to Holland, tend
   to resonate strongly with Netflix viewers. Murphy, who wasn't looking
   to make a niche story, was sold. "It just seemed like [Netflix] really
   understood what I wanted, which is a big, broad, mainstream hit," says
   the showrunner. It's why there's very little profanity and almost no
   nudity in Politician: It's designed to be a family show that kids can
   watch with their parents. "We're really not doing all that much stuff
   that you can't do on network," says Brennan, who, like Murphy and
   Falchuk, also signed an overall deal with the streamer.

   It didn't hurt that Netflix offered a rare two-season order and was
   willing to pony up significant production money, too. "They will pay
   for talent and they will pay for quality," says Murphy. Given the
   all-star cast and creative team, it's no surprise that Politician was
   one of Murphy's more expensive shows — and certainly the most lavish
   onscreen. But that's not to say Netflix was just signing blank checks.
   "That's a myth about them that's not true," says Murphy. "They are very
   responsible." In fact, he's had conversations with execs there who have
   asked him if he could bring the budget down. And he gets it: "They have
   a business." For anything Murphy has desperately wanted, he says,
   they've all sat in a room, rolled up their sleeves and found a way to
   make it work.

   At the top of that list was the need to make the opulent world of the
   series feel authentic. "The sets are amazing, the locations are
   expensive," he says. Never is that more apparent than when Paltrow
   first emerges onscreen in an emerald caftan and $10 million worth of
   jewelry. "Ryan is always very fixated on how I look," chuckles Paltrow,
   who worked with her personal stylist, Elizabeth Saltzman, and the
   show's costume designer, Lou Eyrich, on her character's extravagance.
   "We had to kick him out of the room a couple times." In fact, Paltrow's
   jewelry was so costly that a few of the pieces from Harry Winston were
   delivered to set in armored trucks with bodyguards. Oh, and there's
   that chandelier Murphy insisted on hanging in the background of a barn.
   "Everyone's like, 'That doesn't make any sense,' and I'm like, 'Look at
   this picture of Ellen DeGeneres' stable! Ellen is the most tasteful
   person I know,' " he says.

   Equally important was spending the funds necessary to have sensible
   hours for cast and crew on set. That meant sticking to 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
   days as much as possible, in an effort to improve quality of life, even
   if it resulted in a few extra shoot days. "A lot of us have come up in
   this world, particularly in television, where you work 14-, 16-hour
   days and you burn out. I was like, 'I will not do that anymore,' " says
   Murphy. "I don't want people to be driving home at 4 in the morning."

   Escalating the cost of the package also was Streisand's initial
   interest. Murphy had pitched the multihyphenate — he'd met her at a
   dinner party at her Malibu home a few years ago with her husband, James
   Brolin, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, and Lady Gaga (yes, he got the
   whole tour) — on a role he had in mind specifically for her before
   there was even a script. She considered it, but talks ultimately never
   reached deal-point status. "When we got to [that], as it usually is
   with Barbra, she's like, 'I really don't want to leave Malibu.' She
   doesn't want to work. She wants to be on her music vibe right now,
   which I get," says Murphy, who later tosses around the possibility of
   collaborating with her on a musical special. He swapped one Academy
   Award winner for another when Jessica Lange stepped in to fill the
   void, though getting the show's other Oscar winner, Paltrow, wasn't
   quite as easy.

   "It took some convincing," says husband Falchuk. "A lot of convincing."
   He wrote the part of Georgina, a warm but ultra-privileged woman who
   utters lines like, "This negative energy is not good for your father's
   healing," that make you wonder if the couple is playing some kind of
   thinly veiled joke on viewers by intentionally subverting public
   perceptions of the Goop CEO. "He said, 'You're my muse for this
   character,' and I was like, 'Oh, that's very nice,' " recalls Paltrow,
   whose wellness company has its own series hitting Netflix in early
   2020. But when Falchuk initially asked her if she'd actually play the
   role, her answer was no. "I just was like, 'I can't do any projects
   right now. I have an immense amount of responsibility at my company,' "
   says the 46-year-old actress, who'd already gotten to know Sarandos and
   his wife, Nicole Avant, socially on double dates. But Falchuk, Murphy
   and Netflix execs were so determined that they were willing to build
   the production calendar around Paltrow's Goop schedule. (She was never
   on set for more than a couple days a week, and when she was there, she
   had a flock of Goop staffers by her side.) "It was like, "If you can't
   do something, just tell me and I'll rewrite the scene,' " says Falchuk.

   Also appealing was Murphy's new practice of giving stars he builds
   shows around an executive producer credit and "points" in the project,
   which requires the creators to give up some of theirs. Under Netflix's
   model, that translates to an additional lump sum of cash up front in
   lieu of traditional backend payouts down the road. "My philosophy is
   that they're just as important as the writers or directors, so I
   believe in paying them," says Murphy, who notes that there used to be
   only a handful of actors — Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks — who'd get that.
   The creator first implemented it with Paulson on Ratched and then later
   on Politician with Platt, Lange and Paltrow — though the latter isn't
   quite sure about the inner workings of her deal. "I can't remember
   exactly what it was," she says. "I know I'm an executive producer; I
   don't know exactly what that means in this context." Platt made use of
   his credit by becoming intimately involved in finding the show's
   all-star supporting cast, which includes Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton,
   January Jones, Dylan McDermott and a crop of newcomers. "A lot of times
   you have actors with executive producer credits and it's a goof, it's
   not real," says Falchuk, "but Ben was a participant in all of it."
   Before filming, Platt invited the younger castmembers to his family's
   Malibu home for a weekend and later planned a cast trip to Disneyland.
   "Ben is an amazing leader," says Deutch, with Boynton echoing: "He
   orchestrated [our] getting close very quickly."

   Paltrow wasn't looking to be quite so hands-on. "I already have another
   job, so I wasn't trying to stake my executive producer flag in the
   ground and start bossing anyone around by any means," she says, though
   her husband adds that she'd occasionally suggest changes to her
   character's lines. "She would come to me with, 'This is killing me;
   please don't make me say all this.' OK —" Falchuk smiles as he mimics
   scratching out lines in the air — "and I would never do that for
   anybody else but …" It was, after all, the first time the pair had
   collaborated professionally since meeting when Paltrow guest-starred on
   Glee (unless you count the time Falchuk posed with her for the cover of
   the sex and love issue of Goop's quarterly magazine). Murphy is just
   relieved to see his longtime friends, for whom he threw "the world's
   most opulent wedding party" last year, happy. "They're very
   lovey-dovey, physical and they've found some incredibly rarefied
   space," he says. "They both went through a lot, and I was with them for
   a lot of years where it wasn't so great." The show was, for Paltrow, a
   chance to watch her behind-the-scenes husband step into more of a
   leadership role. "It's so fun to be working with someone who you're in
   love with," she says. "I was like, 'Agh! He's so hot, he's so talented,
   this is so fun.' "

   ***

   Concerns that Murphy might struggle with the transition from his
   close-knit community at 20th to Netflix, perceived by some as a
   soulless Silicon Valley machine, haven't gone unnoticed by the
   showrunner. "I don't feel like there was a great trauma like I thought
   there would be and like people in the press speculated," says Murphy,
   who still works out of his Fox lot offices as he builds his new Netflix
   workspace two miles southwest of the company's Sunset Boulevard
   headquarters. "There is a warmth and a family vibe there [at Netflix]
   that I did not expect. It feels like a group of people that you could
   go on vacation with." Day-to-day, he works most closely with Wright,
   Holland and Scott Stuber, Netflix's film head. He's particularly
   enjoying the latter relationship, as he never had much of one with
   20th's film division, something that still perplexes him. Murphy also
   has a direct line to Sarandos, which he tries not to abuse. "Ted's like
   Dad," he says. "You [only] call Dad when you need Dad." ("Mom" will
   always be his former Fox boss and now Disney TV chief Dana Walden, says
   Murphy, who still speaks with her daily.) He's only had to call
   Sarandos a few times — mostly with clarifying questions. "It wasn't
   anything bad," he insists. "It was like, 'Hey, I'm new to this, what
   about this?' " Sarandos watches Murphy's cuts and was the first person
   to write him a 3 a.m. email telling him he was "obsessed" with The
   Politician after bingeing the episodes. "That's what you want," adds
   Murphy. "You want Dad to love you and to get you."

   The prolific showrunner's first three to five projects for Sarandos and
   company will be "patina'd, star-driven, commercial things," he teases.
   Just after starting at the streamer, Murphy had lunch with Holland and
   Wright and pitched them seven ideas: shows he wanted to make, genres he
   was interested in exploring, stars with whom he hoped to work. "He has
   big ambitions," says Holland. They jotted them down and came back
   telling him the three that excited them the most, but made it clear he
   should eventually do them all. "I have greenlight power on everything,"
   says Murphy. "But I'm never going to make something if they don't want
   me to make it." A year into his deal, he has yet to cross paths with
   fellow Netflix showrunners Rhimes or Barris. "I think we're all working
   on our own stuff," he adds.

   Come September, Murphy will experience his first "drop" as a creator.
   As someone all too familiar with weekly watercooler buzz, he may have a
   difficult time adjusting to the burn-twice-as-bright-for-half-as-long
   binge model. "What we have all known as television — an episode drops a
   week, you promote the shit out of it, you drive down Sunset, there's
   your billboard," he says, "that's not the future." He's become privy to
   some of the streamer's proprietary insights, such as that people who
   view his shows on the platform also tend to watch Bob's Burgers. "Who
   knew?" he says. "That's millions and millions of people that I never
   would think."

   Of course, Murphy will continue to serve as his own publicity generator
   (not only through press but via his million-plus social media
   followers). "There is a lot of P.T. Barnum in Ryan," says Walden. "He's
   going to be able to teach Netflix a lot because he understands that
   process very well." Netflix already has been hosting private screenings
   of The Politician for media and influencers in an effort to drum up a
   word-of-mouth campaign. Sarandos made the rounds at the L.A. event at
   San Vicente Bungalows, as Tyra Banks, Rob Lowe and Ed Westwick mingled
   with the show's cast and creators. Paltrow appeared at one in the
   Hamptons, where she spends her summers, with her mother. "I'm
   definitely going to do some promotion," she says. "As little as I can
   get away with, but still."

   As Murphy learns to navigate the Netflix way, one emotionally charged
   subject he'll inevitably have to come to terms with is his relationship
   with ratings. That the streamer provided a safe harbor from them was an
   obvious draw for the showrunner, who calls the daily report card
   "absolute bullshit." But in the sort of twist you'd expect to find in
   one of his shows, Netflix has begun releasing metrics for some of its
   high-profile fare. Holland says they'll let Murphy see the viewership
   on his projects, should he want to — though he claims he doesn't. "I'm
   not interested in that," he says. "All I want to hear is let's do more
   or let's not." (Awards likely wouldn't hurt, either.) It's a peculiar
   stance for someone who was spellbound by the data-packed presentation
   Netflix dazzled him with in an early meeting (he still talks about the
   map with the blinking lights illustrating his global reach). Some of
   Murphy's closest collaborators, including Falchuk, don't buy it: "He's
   going to want to know."

   Back in the trailer, Murphy's phone buzzes, reminding him he's nearly
   late to a script meeting for one of his dozen projects. Ratched, Boys,
   Hollywood and The Prom (which stars Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman) are
   all in various stages of pre- to postproduction, and The Politician's
   second season starts up in October. He's also got three documentary
   projects, plus three other series in development at the streamer — to
   say nothing of his five 20th shows, most of which have second windows
   on Netflix. (There's even talk of a "Ryan Murphy" button or row on the
   platform, though the details have yet to be fleshed out.) What is clear
   is that for someone who works 18-hour days, relying on the occasional
   IV vitamin drip to stay healthy, the irony of Murphy's efforts to
   create more manageable workdays for cast and crew is apparent. "I will
   always be this person," he says. "I want to be Norman Lear. I want to
   work when I'm 96 years old."

Box Office: Why 'Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' Isn't Clicking

   February 11, 2019 6:40am by Pamela McClintock
   Skewing young, the sequel opened well behind expectations and at about
   half of its predecessor's earnings.

   There was nothing awesome about the box office debut of The Lego Movie
   2: The Second Part.

   The sequel opened to an estimated $34 million-$35 million in North
   America, well behind an expected $50 million to $55 million, and half
   as much as the 2014 film. Blame the movie's surprisingly soft
   performance on franchise fatigue, according to box office analysts. A
   less-than-inspired marketing campaign is another factor, analysts add.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   Lego Movie 2 is also struggling badly overseas, where it launched to
   $18 million from 63 territories for a worldwide bow of $53 million.
   Globally, the $100 million movie needs to earn $200 million-$225
   million to break even.

   It has been five years since The Lego Movie, directed by Phil Lord and
   Christopher Miller, opened to a huge $69 million. It took Lord and
   Miller, who wrote and directed 2009's animated Cloudy With a Chance of
   Meatballs for Sony and also directed 2012's live-action 21 Jump Street,
   to the next level. and it put Warners in the animation game.

   The studio responded by plotting two spinoffs that hit theaters within
   months of each other. The Lego Batman Movie started off with $53
   million domestically in February 2017, followed that September by The
   Lego Ninjago Movie with a cautionary debut of $20.3 million on its way
   to earning just $123 million worldwide.

   "I certainly think franchise fatigue is a major factor in the massive
   property devaluation of this WB franchise," says Jeff Bock of Exhibitor
   Relations. "Audiences probably could have done without Ninjago. And the
   truth of the matter is, five years is a long time. The Second Part
   seemed like a retread from the get-go, resting on the laurels of the
   original."

   Lord and Miller returned to write and produce The Second Part, but they
   weren't the only high-profile names to return. Lego Movie 2 sees Chris
   Pratt once again voice the role of everyman construction worker Emmet
   Brickowski, and Will Ferrell voice the evil Lord Business. Elizabeth
   Banks, Will Arnett, Alison Brie and Nick Offerman also reprise their
   roles, while new additions to the voice cast include Tiffany Haddish,
   Stephanie Beatriz and Maya Rudolph.

   There were no obvious warning sings that Lego Movie 2 was in trouble.
   Heading into the weekend, it boasted a Rotten Tomatoes score of 84
   percent. While that didn't match the 95 percent bestowed on the 2014
   movie, it's still a strong score.

   But when Friday box office returns started coming in, executives at
   Warners were rattled, both by the actual grosses and exit surveys
   revealing that the sequel was playing far younger than the first Lego
   Movie, which drew its strength from appealing to college students and
   adults, in addition to kids. This time, 48 percent of ticket buyers
   were under the age of 18, compared with 41 percent in 2014.

   "The marketing just seemed to be on autopilot. Look, I know Warner
   Bros. didn't feel like they had to sell the sequel, but the declining
   grosses for Lego Batman and Lego Ninjago should have been a huge red
   flag. Reconnecting with their core audience obviously didn't happen,"
   says Bock.

   "The more and more I look at this series, the original was likely an
   event because of the novelty," he continues. "You just can't cuddle a
   Lego."

How Will Marvel Universe Move on Without Spider-Man?

   August 20, 2019 3:17pm by Graeme McMillan
   Sony has complete control of Peter Parker again, which makes a Venom
   crossover much more likely in the future.

   Sony has complete control of Peter Parker again, which makes a Venom
   crossover much more likely in the future.

   How do you solve a problem like Peter Parker? News broke Tuesday that
   Sony and Marvel Studios have split and will no longer work on future
   Spider-Man films together. Sony and Marvel's falling out doesn’t just
   mean that Kevin Feige won’t get a producer credit on any future
   Spider-Man movies; it almost certainly means that Tom Holland’s version
   of the wall-crawler is going to be absent from the Marvel Cinematic
   Universe effective immediately, despite both studios having spent the
   last three years ensuring that Spider-Man is a central part of what
   audiences think of when they think “Marvel.”

   Ultimately, this is far more of a problem for Marvel than it is for
   Sony; for all that the latter might lose the cache of having an MCU
   cameo or two in future Spider-Man movies — or, more importantly, the
   certainty of the Marvel Studios creative touch — it would be easy
   enough for Sony’s future Spider-Man movies to just never mention the
   Avengers anymore, or refer to characters and events indirectly to keep
   IP lawyers from getting too jittery.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   Additionally, bringing Spider-Man back to a prospective Sonyverse means
   that the possibility of his meeting Tom Hardy’s Venom, or Jared Leto’s
   Morbius, currently in production, has just significantly increased,
   much to the delight of internet meme makers everywhere.

   For those nervous that losing Marvel from the Spidey moviemaking
   decision process — not the most unreasonable response, considering the
   confused state of Sony’s Spider-slate before the Marvel partnership was
   announced in early 2015 — let’s remember that Spider-Man: Into the
   Spider-Verse writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller are already
   developing new Spider-Man ideas for Sony, albeit the TV side. How
   difficult would it be to get them to start thinking of more big-screen
   ideas, too…?

   For Marvel, however, there’s a bit more of a problem. Since his
   introduction in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man has been
   an increasingly integral part of the MCU. Outside of his two solo
   movies since then, he was also one of the most visible characters in
   Avengers: Infinity War, and his death in that movie proved to be one of
   the primary motivators for Tony Stark’s actions in Avengers: Endgame
   the following year. The most recent solo pic, Spider-Man: Far From
   Home, not only was responsible for introducing the new status quo of
   the MCU, but it also seemed to tease the next big multi-movie storyline
   for Marvel Studios. Spider-Man, it was clear, was very important to the
   MCU.

   And now, he won’t be there.

   On the one hand, this won’t be an immediate problem for Marvel — note
   that there was no Spider-Man movie announced as part of Marvel’s Phase
   IV at San Diego Comic-Con last month — but on the other… How, exactly,
   is Marvel going to dance around the fact that it can no longer feature
   the character who — in the very last Marvel movie released — was the
   face of the MCU superheroes?

   It could, of course, simply not mention him and hope that everyone in
   the audience understands why, but that seems like a somewhat risky move
   given the vocal demands of the fan base. There’s the potential for some
   comic, cosmic switcheroo storyline that literally replaces Spider-Man
   with characters from the Fantastic Four or X-Men franchises, which
   would arguably give those introductions additional narrative weight
   (and could explain why no one has heard of those characters to this
   point).

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tvAjX5ACPo

   Perhaps this is too premature. In 2012, as The Avengers were hitting
   the big screen, it seemed unthinkable that Spider-Man would be joining
   them in a Civil War movie four years later. Perhaps Sony and Marvel
   will make peace and craft a deal to maintain the integrity of the MCU,
   such as it is. But if not, don’t be too surprised if the fifth Avengers
   movie opens with Doctor Strange looking at an indistinct corpse in a
   mortuary and commenting that, yes, it’s Peter and it’s such a shame
   that the accident left him utterly unrecognizable and he’ll be an
   inspiration to everyone moving forward. It’s what he would have wanted.

Viacom Acquires Free Streaming Platform Pluto TV for $340 Million

   Viacom CEO Bob Bakish

Pluto has more than 12 million monthly active users for its lean-back
streaming video platform.

   As its competitors rush to launch Netflix-style subscription streaming
   services, Viacom is making a bet on free programming.

   The company is paying $340 million in cash to acquire free streaming
   service Pluto TV, which it plans to use as a distribution outlet for
   digital programming from brands like Awesomeness and as a marketing
   tool for its portfolio of media brands. The deal is expected to close
   during the first quarter of the year.

   "As the video marketplace continues to segment, we see an opportunity
   to support the ecosystem in creating products at a broad range of price
   points, including free," CEO Bob Bakish said Tuesday in a statement
   announcing the purchase. "To that end, we see significant white space
   in the ad-supported streaming market and are excited to work with the
   talented Pluto TV team, and a broad range of Viacom partners, to
   accelerate its growth in the U.S. and all over the world."

   Founded in 2013, Pluto TV was created with the premise that, despite
   the on-demand nature of streaming services like Netflix or YouTube,
   consumers were still looking for a lean-back experience. It licensed
   shortform digital programming primarily from YouTube and curated the
   videos into channels based on a specific genre or brand. Over time, it
   began to license films and television shows from the major Hollywood
   studios and organized them into customized channels like Pluto TV
   Movies or TV Drama. Today, Pluto offers more than 100 channels
   featuring programming from more than 130 partners. The company, which
   is said to have a $200 million run rate, claims an audience of 12
   million monthly active users, two-thirds of whom watch via connected
   TVs.

   "Since our launch less than five years ago, and particularly over the
   past year, Pluto TV has enjoyed explosive growth and become the
   category leader in free streaming television," said Pluto TV co-founder
   and CEO Tom Ryan. "Viacom's portfolio of global, iconic brands and IP,
   advanced advertising leadership and international reach will enable
   Pluto TV to grow even faster and become a major force in streaming TV
   worldwide. Viacom is the perfect partner to help us accomplish our
   mission of entertaining the planet."

   Viacom, which has been steadily building up a digital business through
   the acquisitions of influencer marketing platform WhoSay and digital
   producer Awesomeness, sees an opportunity to utilize Pluto to reach
   consumers directly and use it as an entry point for subscription
   businesses Noggin and Comedy Central Now. Further, it will connect
   Viacom with a predominantly young, tech-driven viewership that largely
   isn't paying for cable, where it primarily distributes networks like
   MTV and BET.

   The deal comes during a pivotal moment for legacy media companies.
   Disney, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal are all currently working on
   streaming services that will help them not only take on Netflix but
   also allow them to create a direct relationship with consumers as cable
   subscriptions decline. Acquiring Pluto will give Viacom the opportunity
   to experiment with streaming video without going all-in on a
   subscription business. The company says that the deal will not disrupt
   its existing pay TV relationships.

'Game of Thrones' Creators Close $200M Netflix Overall Deal

In this story

   Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Netflix Netflix
   David Benioff and Dan Weiss have signed a multiyear film and TV pact
   with the streamer, which was bidding for the duo's services alongside
   Disney and Amazon.

   Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss officially have a
   new home.

   The duo have signed what sources say is a $200 million multiyear
   overall film and TV deal with Netflix. Under the pact, Benioff and
   Weiss will depart their longtime home at HBO and create and develop new
   projects for the streaming giant.

   "We are thrilled to welcome master storytellers David Benioff and Dan
   Weiss to Netflix. They are a creative force and have delighted
   audiences worldwide with their epic storytelling. We can’t wait to see
   what their imaginations will bring to our members," Netflix chief
   content officer Ted Sarandos said Wednesday in a statement.

   Added Benioff and Weiss in a joint statement: "We’ve had a beautiful
   run with HBO for more than a decade and we’re grateful to everyone
   there for always making us feel at home. Over the past few months we’ve
   spent many hours talking to Cindy Holland and Peter Friedlander, as
   well as Ted Sarandos and Scott Stuber. We remember the same shots from
   the same '80s movies; we love the same books; we’re excited about the
   same storytelling possibilities. Netflix has built something astounding
   and unprecedented, and we're honored they invited us to join them."

   Benioff and Weiss, who created and served as showrunners on HBO's
   megahit Game of Thrones, were also in discussions with Disney (and its
   newly owned cable network FX) and Amazon, and came to their decision
   after extensive talks with Netflix.

   Sources say Amazon Studios had been the front-runner until early July,
   when Netflix re-emerged with a competitive offer. Disney had also
   entered the conversation more recently, as some said the new
   super-sized Mouse House might have been offering a TV deal with FX
   Productions to go alongside a film pact with the company. Benioff and
   Weiss are already in business with Disney, working on a Star Wars
   trilogy for Disney-owned Lucasfilm.

   Sources say Benioff and Weiss were seeking a deal worth as much as $200
   million as they attempt to surpass the $150 million pact Westworld
   creators Lisa Joy and Jonah Nolan signed with Amazon in April. Joy and
   Nolan's five-year agreement is estimated to be worth in the
   $30-million-per-year territory. When factoring in payouts from Warner
   Bros. TV to remain showrunners on three additional seasons of HBO's
   Westworld, Joy and Nolan's deal clocks in at $200 million.

   Heat around Benioff and Weiss — who fired their longtime reps at
   Management 360 as they sought a new deal — ramped up this summer and
   reached a fever pitch after Game of Thrones set a new Emmy record for
   the most nominations by a single program in one year (32). The pair had
   quietly begun canvassing the marketplace earlier this year, taking
   meetings with media titans including HBO parent WarnerMedia (which is
   in final negotiations for a $500 million pact with J.J. Abrams' Bad
   Robot), Disney, Comcast, Amazon and Apple.

   Benioff and Weiss, with Game of Thrones now in the rearview mirror,
   were said to want to focus on building up their company. Any new deal
   with the duo was considered likely have to include overhead costs to
   set up a production company. The bigger question about Benioff and
   Weiss is going to be just when they would have time to focus on new
   projects, given their commitment to writing a Star Wars trilogy for
   Disney.

   The first pic in their trilogy has already been earmarked for a Dec.
   16, 2022, release date. (Two subsequent Star Wars features have also
   been dated — for December 2024 and December 2026 — though it's unclear
   which, if any of these, are from Benioff and Weiss or Rian Johnson, who
   is also developing a second trilogy for Lucasfilm.)

   Still, Star Wars was always poised to take priority over their
   previously announced projects at HBO. Benioff and Weiss were set to
   write and serve as showrunners on Confederate, the straight-to-series
   drama alongside Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified, The Good Wife)
   and Malcolm Spellman (Empire). The show — which takes place in an
   alternate timeline where the Southern states have successfully seceded
   from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal
   and has evolved into a modern institution — immediately drew
   controversy. That series was eyed to launch in either 2018 or 2019,
   after Benioff and Weiss completed their work on the final season of
   Thrones. Following the backlash, the project was shelved indefinitely.
   Their new overall with Netflix wipes Confederate off HBO's books.

   Sources say HBO — the duo's longtime home for the past decade — met
   with Benioff and Weiss' legal teams and quickly determined that they
   did not want to compete to keep them given the size of the deal and
   their looming commitment to Star Wars. Still, the two will be credited
   as executive producers on any and all Game of Thrones prequel series,
   though they declined to be involved in any sort of hands-on capacity
   with any of the scripts currently in development/at the pilot stage.
   (HBO programming president Casey Bloys told reporters this week that
   production on the prequel pilot has been completed.)

   "They're meeting everywhere, which I totally get," Bloys told The
   Hollywood Reporter in May after the Game of Thrones series finale.
   "It's a great time to be a creator. People are throwing open doors and
   throwing money around. So if you're a creator with a proven track
   record, it's a great time. I think they're doing the right thing and
   seeing what's out there. We obviously have a strong relationship with
   them; Warner Bros. has worked with them both individually in the past.
   We'll see where they end up. Obviously, we think they're great. They're
   going through the process they should go through."

   As for Netflix, the free-spending streamer that upended the market for
   overall deals, is fresh off a sour earnings quarter that saw it shed
   subscribers and miss its projections. Netflix has been making a wave of
   scripted cancellations (The O.A., Chambers, She's Gotta Have It,
   Designated Survivor, Tuca and Bertie) as it weighs the cost of new
   programs against returning seasons and which of those two is more
   attractive to potential new subscribers. The company already has deals
   with mega-producers Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes and Kenya Barris, among
   others, across multiple programming genres.

   Benioff and Weiss are repped by Hansen Jacobson.

Wealth, Privilege and Gwyneth Paltrow: How Ryan Murphy's First Netflix Show
Takes Down Trump-Era Entitlement

   by Bryn Elise Sandberg

   August 07, 2019, 6:00am PDT

'The Politician,' also starring Ben Platt, Zoey Deutch and Jessica Lange,
eviscerates the absurd lengths the .001  percent will go to stay on top — and
the writers even predicted the college cheating scandal: "It is about the
ugliest thing someone of means can do."

   Midway through the first episode of Ryan Murphy's debut Netflix series,
   The Politician, Ben Platt's Tracy Flick-esque character finds out he's
   been wait-listed at Harvard, his dream school and an essential pit stop
   on his meticulously plotted journey to the White House. He's venting to
   his adoptive mom, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who's wearing a bright-red
   Carolina Herrera gown as she cuts the roses in their sprawling,
   perfectly manicured California garden, about how unfair it is that his
   considerably less impressive older brothers got in.

   "Well," says Paltrow, matter-of-factly, "your father and I bought their
   way in."

   At first, the line seems like a playful nod to the college admissions
   cheating scandal, the spectacle of privilege that saw 50 parents,
   including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, arrested
   earlier this year for allegedly bribing their kids' way into top-tier
   universities. But what most viewers won't know when the eight-episode
   series premieres Sept. 27 is that the scene was written by Murphy and
   his Politician co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, the trio
   behind Glee and Scream Queens, eight months before Operation Varsity
   Blues captivated the nation.

   "We lucked into that," says Murphy, tucked into a corner couch in his
   trailer on the Sunset Gower lot, where he's adapting his Tony-winning
   Broadway staging of Boys in the Band — among the 12 projects he's
   juggling — as a movie for Netflix. It's not the first time Murphy has
   had an eerie premonition in one of his shows, either. It happened with
   the "Nor'easter" episode in the second season of American Horror Story,
   which aired two days after Hurricane Sandy made landfall, and on a
   later season of Nip/Tuck, when a line seemingly alluding to a Tiger
   Woods sex scandal was written well before the golfer's extramarital
   affairs were public knowledge. Psychics have even told the showrunner
   that his astrological sign bestows him with prophetic abilities. He's a
   triple Scorpio, if you're into that sort of thing — which he isn't.

   Of the growing list of creators Netflix has poached from traditional
   studios with jaw-dropping deals (Shonda Rhimes, Kenya Barris), Murphy
   is the first to actually launch a Netflix original, albeit one that was
   picked up under his previous pact and is thus produced by Fox 21
   Television Studios. "Ryan likes to move fast," says Netflix vp original
   content Cindy Holland, who notes that he came in eager to set up a
   cadre of projects after inking his landmark $300 million deal in
   February 2018. "I felt an obligation. If you're going to get that kind
   of deal, I wanted to be like, 'Let's get to it,' " says Murphy. "And I
   live for the drops," he adds, ticking off Stranger Things and
   Mindhunter as his most anticipated of the year. "I was like, 'I want to
   be a part of that.' " There's considerable interest around how The
   Politician might fare — in terms of viewership numbers (which, given
   Netflix's tradition of withholding, may never be widely known) as well
   as its ability to capture the zeitgeist the way Murphy's Fox and FX
   shows routinely have. Netflix is betting the showrunner's knack for
   having his finger on the societal pulse will pay off. Says Holland, "I
   think people are interested in these cultural conversations about class
   and privilege."

   To hear Murphy tell it, The Politician is a class takedown in the vein
   of such satirical 1970s films as The Candidate and Shampoo — but with a
   modern, Trumpy twist. "It's wealthy people behaving badly," he says.
   "All of this has been percolating in the culture, particularly under
   this president and this idea of Ivanka and Jared [as] the sort of
   satanic poster boy and girl for privilege and nepotism." In fact, the
   president's son-in-law's curious acceptance into Harvard was the chief
   inspiration for the show's storyline. Falchuk, 48, was fascinated by
   reports that Kushner's real estate developer father had pledged $2.5
   million to Harvard before his son was admitted. "This guy was walking
   around with the pride of being a Harvard graduate, and the reality was
   that he didn't belong there," recalls Falchuk, who married Paltrow in
   September. "I said, 'We've got to tell that story.' " It's why the
   show, which takes place in an affluent, comically liberal area of Santa
   Barbara, centers on a young man determined to become the president of
   the United States — on his own merit.

   The writers' own brushes with privilege were always in the background,
   too. While Murphy, Falchuk and Brennan all came to Hollywood with solid
   educations, none attended Ivy League universities. "We've talked a lot
   about a group of writers in Hollywood — the Yale guys, the Harvard guys
   — and we've always been curious about, like, 'What is that like?' "
   says Murphy, who worked three jobs to put himself through school at
   Indiana University Bloomington. "We were kind of satirizing that." That
   all three are dads at various stages of getting their own children into
   schools only made the scandal more eye-opening. "I want to slap every
   one of those people because nobody took my SATs for me," says Brennan,
   41, of the indicted parents. "It's such a gross thing and it drives me
   fucking nuts. It is about the ugliest thing that someone of means can
   do, and it's not a good look for this town."

   While Murphy may have had inklings that the growing epidemic of
   unchecked privilege eventually would give way to a cultural reckoning,
   what he couldn't predict is that people he knew would become embroiled
   in the scandal. Though he's never worked with Loughlin or Huffman, he
   does consider the latter a friend. "It's a sensitive thing," says
   Murphy, whose two boys with photographer husband David Miller are 4 and
   6. "Do I agree with what they did? No. Do I understand what they did?
   Yes. I think it's all out of a love of your child, and I think that the
   system has gone so crazy," adds Murphy of Huffman, who pleaded guilty
   to paying $15,000 to doctor her daughter's SAT scores. "I have always
   liked her — and I believe in redemption and in second chances."
   Pervasive internet rumors aside, there are no plans for American Crime
   Story: College Cheating Scandal. "I will not be doing that," he says
   flatly.

   Unlike his Crime Story anthology, based on real-life events, The
   Politician isn't designed to be so literal. The plan is for each of the
   seasons, initially envisioned as five, to follow Platt's fictional
   character, Payton Hobart, as he runs in a different election, from
   student government to the presidency. "It's not a show on current U.S.
   politics. It's more about the phenomenon of what it takes to be a
   politician and how much of yourself you have to sacrifice to be a good
   one," says Platt, who is starring in his first series after a
   Tony-winning role in Broadway's Dear Evan Hansen. Though the name
   Donald Trump is never uttered, some real-life politicians are infused
   into Platt's character. Among them: Obama, Nixon and Alexandria
   Ocasio-Cortez. "Enough with the baby boomers [in American politics].
   Like, bye-bye," says Murphy, who at 53 is at the very tail end of that
   generation and eager for a changing of the guard. "You can see that
   people get excited by young people like AOC. You may love her, you may
   hate her, but she is an exciting figure because she is the future,"
   says the showrunner, whose dream 2020 ticket is Kamala Harris and Pete
   Buttigieg. "That's what I'm trying to write about."

   ***

   Murphy had been itching to write something about ambition — his, in
   particular — for some time. "My ambition has always been …" he pauses,
   " 'sociopathic' is too strong of a word — but maybe not." The ideal
   vehicle for the concept, though, was always fuzzy. That is, until he
   discovered Platt in Dear Evan Hansen in spring 2017. "I had never seen
   a male actor able to be vulnerable and accessible and neurotic," he
   says. "Usually it's women who do that brilliantly." Murphy immediately
   thought of Barbra Streisand, who was actually attached to The
   Politician at one point. "Ben is that kind of figure. And also, like
   Barbra, very ambitious." The 25-year-old actor-singer was tired of
   playing the sweet, nerdy, wallflower-y teen he had been in Hansen, Book
   of Mormon and Pitch Perfect. He wanted desperately to sink his teeth
   into someone confident, dark, sexual and, yes, ambitious. "As soon as
   he told me that, it clocked me into those ideas that I had [for this
   project]," recalls Murphy.

   Platt, who grew up in Beverly Hills as the fourth of film and theater
   producer Marc Platt's five children, wasn't exactly a stranger to the
   kind of rarefied world that The Politician skewers. "It's a lot of very
   privileged wealthy white people, and I think now is the time to take a
   blackhearted look at that," he says. Paltrow, herself the daughter of
   Hollywood royalty Blythe Danner and the late director Bruce Paltrow,
   says the cheating scandal is emblematic of the problems with excess
   wealth, something her husband has strong views on. "Brad really doesn't
   believe in accruing generational wealth like that … because he feels
   like it keeps this vast difference between segments of the population,"
   she says. "He's very progressive like that."

   20th shopped the show around town in late 2017, sparking a fierce
   bidding war. What the competition didn't know was that Netflix execs
   Ted Sarandos and Holland had a considerable leg up: Not only had they
   already snagged Murphy's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest prequel,
   Ratched, starring Sarah Paulson, but they also were in the process of
   wooing him with a staggering nine-figure overall pact. For Murphy, what
   ultimately sealed the deal on Politician was a dinner he had around
   that time with Holland and Brian Wright, the Netflix exec shepherding
   the streamer's young-adult shows. Wright, who counts Stranger Things
   and 13 Reasons Why among his stable, was regaling Murphy with details
   of how those programs racked up tens of millions of views and how The
   Politician, were it on their service, could do the same. After all,
   high school-set shows with broader themes, according to Holland, tend
   to resonate strongly with Netflix viewers. Murphy, who wasn't looking
   to make a niche story, was sold. "It just seemed like [Netflix] really
   understood what I wanted, which is a big, broad, mainstream hit," says
   the showrunner. It's why there's very little profanity and almost no
   nudity in Politician: It's designed to be a family show that kids can
   watch with their parents. "We're really not doing all that much stuff
   that you can't do on network," says Brennan, who, like Murphy and
   Falchuk, also signed an overall deal with the streamer.

   It didn't hurt that Netflix offered a rare two-season order and was
   willing to pony up significant production money, too. "They will pay
   for talent and they will pay for quality," says Murphy. Given the
   all-star cast and creative team, it's no surprise that Politician was
   one of Murphy's more expensive shows — and certainly the most lavish
   onscreen. But that's not to say Netflix was just signing blank checks.
   "That's a myth about them that's not true," says Murphy. "They are very
   responsible." In fact, he's had conversations with execs there who have
   asked him if he could bring the budget down. And he gets it: "They have
   a business." For anything Murphy has desperately wanted, he says,
   they've all sat in a room, rolled up their sleeves and found a way to
   make it work.

   At the top of that list was the need to make the opulent world of the
   series feel authentic. "The sets are amazing, the locations are
   expensive," he says. Never is that more apparent than when Paltrow
   first emerges onscreen in an emerald caftan and $10 million worth of
   jewelry. "Ryan is always very fixated on how I look," chuckles Paltrow,
   who worked with her personal stylist, Elizabeth Saltzman, and the
   show's costume designer, Lou Eyrich, on her character's extravagance.
   "We had to kick him out of the room a couple times." In fact, Paltrow's
   jewelry was so costly that a few of the pieces from Harry Winston were
   delivered to set in armored trucks with bodyguards. Oh, and there's
   that chandelier Murphy insisted on hanging in the background of a barn.
   "Everyone's like, 'That doesn't make any sense,' and I'm like, 'Look at
   this picture of Ellen DeGeneres' stable! Ellen is the most tasteful
   person I know,' " he says.

   Equally important was spending the funds necessary to have sensible
   hours for cast and crew on set. That meant sticking to 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
   days as much as possible, in an effort to improve quality of life, even
   if it resulted in a few extra shoot days. "A lot of us have come up in
   this world, particularly in television, where you work 14-, 16-hour
   days and you burn out. I was like, 'I will not do that anymore,' " says
   Murphy. "I don't want people to be driving home at 4 in the morning."

   Escalating the cost of the package also was Streisand's initial
   interest. Murphy had pitched the multihyphenate — he'd met her at a
   dinner party at her Malibu home a few years ago with her husband, James
   Brolin, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, and Lady Gaga (yes, he got the
   whole tour) — on a role he had in mind specifically for her before
   there was even a script. She considered it, but talks ultimately never
   reached deal-point status. "When we got to [that], as it usually is
   with Barbra, she's like, 'I really don't want to leave Malibu.' She
   doesn't want to work. She wants to be on her music vibe right now,
   which I get," says Murphy, who later tosses around the possibility of
   collaborating with her on a musical special. He swapped one Academy
   Award winner for another when Jessica Lange stepped in to fill the
   void, though getting the show's other Oscar winner, Paltrow, wasn't
   quite as easy.

   "It took some convincing," says husband Falchuk. "A lot of convincing."
   He wrote the part of Georgina, a warm but ultra-privileged woman who
   utters lines like, "This negative energy is not good for your father's
   healing," that make you wonder if the couple is playing some kind of
   thinly veiled joke on viewers by intentionally subverting public
   perceptions of the Goop CEO. "He said, 'You're my muse for this
   character,' and I was like, 'Oh, that's very nice,' " recalls Paltrow,
   whose wellness company has its own series hitting Netflix in early
   2020. But when Falchuk initially asked her if she'd actually play the
   role, her answer was no. "I just was like, 'I can't do any projects
   right now. I have an immense amount of responsibility at my company,' "
   says the 46-year-old actress, who'd already gotten to know Sarandos and
   his wife, Nicole Avant, socially on double dates. But Falchuk, Murphy
   and Netflix execs were so determined that they were willing to build
   the production calendar around Paltrow's Goop schedule. (She was never
   on set for more than a couple days a week, and when she was there, she
   had a flock of Goop staffers by her side.) "It was like, "If you can't
   do something, just tell me and I'll rewrite the scene,' " says Falchuk.

   Also appealing was Murphy's new practice of giving stars he builds
   shows around an executive producer credit and "points" in the project,
   which requires the creators to give up some of theirs. Under Netflix's
   model, that translates to an additional lump sum of cash up front in
   lieu of traditional backend payouts down the road. "My philosophy is
   that they're just as important as the writers or directors, so I
   believe in paying them," says Murphy, who notes that there used to be
   only a handful of actors — Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks — who'd get that.
   The creator first implemented it with Paulson on Ratched and then later
   on Politician with Platt, Lange and Paltrow — though the latter isn't
   quite sure about the inner workings of her deal. "I can't remember
   exactly what it was," she says. "I know I'm an executive producer; I
   don't know exactly what that means in this context." Platt made use of
   his credit by becoming intimately involved in finding the show's
   all-star supporting cast, which includes Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton,
   January Jones, Dylan McDermott and a crop of newcomers. "A lot of times
   you have actors with executive producer credits and it's a goof, it's
   not real," says Falchuk, "but Ben was a participant in all of it."
   Before filming, Platt invited the younger castmembers to his family's
   Malibu home for a weekend and later planned a cast trip to Disneyland.
   "Ben is an amazing leader," says Deutch, with Boynton echoing: "He
   orchestrated [our] getting close very quickly."

   Paltrow wasn't looking to be quite so hands-on. "I already have another
   job, so I wasn't trying to stake my executive producer flag in the
   ground and start bossing anyone around by any means," she says, though
   her husband adds that she'd occasionally suggest changes to her
   character's lines. "She would come to me with, 'This is killing me;
   please don't make me say all this.' OK —" Falchuk smiles as he mimics
   scratching out lines in the air — "and I would never do that for
   anybody else but …" It was, after all, the first time the pair had
   collaborated professionally since meeting when Paltrow guest-starred on
   Glee (unless you count the time Falchuk posed with her for the cover of
   the sex and love issue of Goop's quarterly magazine). Murphy is just
   relieved to see his longtime friends, for whom he threw "the world's
   most opulent wedding party" last year, happy. "They're very
   lovey-dovey, physical and they've found some incredibly rarefied
   space," he says. "They both went through a lot, and I was with them for
   a lot of years where it wasn't so great." The show was, for Paltrow, a
   chance to watch her behind-the-scenes husband step into more of a
   leadership role. "It's so fun to be working with someone who you're in
   love with," she says. "I was like, 'Agh! He's so hot, he's so talented,
   this is so fun.' "

   ***

   Concerns that Murphy might struggle with the transition from his
   close-knit community at 20th to Netflix, perceived by some as a
   soulless Silicon Valley machine, haven't gone unnoticed by the
   showrunner. "I don't feel like there was a great trauma like I thought
   there would be and like people in the press speculated," says Murphy,
   who still works out of his Fox lot offices as he builds his new Netflix
   workspace two miles southwest of the company's Sunset Boulevard
   headquarters. "There is a warmth and a family vibe there [at Netflix]
   that I did not expect. It feels like a group of people that you could
   go on vacation with." Day-to-day, he works most closely with Wright,
   Holland and Scott Stuber, Netflix's film head. He's particularly
   enjoying the latter relationship, as he never had much of one with
   20th's film division, something that still perplexes him. Murphy also
   has a direct line to Sarandos, which he tries not to abuse. "Ted's like
   Dad," he says. "You [only] call Dad when you need Dad." ("Mom" will
   always be his former Fox boss and now Disney TV chief Dana Walden, says
   Murphy, who still speaks with her daily.) He's only had to call
   Sarandos a few times — mostly with clarifying questions. "It wasn't
   anything bad," he insists. "It was like, 'Hey, I'm new to this, what
   about this?' " Sarandos watches Murphy's cuts and was the first person
   to write him a 3 a.m. email telling him he was "obsessed" with The
   Politician after bingeing the episodes. "That's what you want," adds
   Murphy. "You want Dad to love you and to get you."

   The prolific showrunner's first three to five projects for Sarandos and
   company will be "patina'd, star-driven, commercial things," he teases.
   Just after starting at the streamer, Murphy had lunch with Holland and
   Wright and pitched them seven ideas: shows he wanted to make, genres he
   was interested in exploring, stars with whom he hoped to work. "He has
   big ambitions," says Holland. They jotted them down and came back
   telling him the three that excited them the most, but made it clear he
   should eventually do them all. "I have greenlight power on everything,"
   says Murphy. "But I'm never going to make something if they don't want
   me to make it." A year into his deal, he has yet to cross paths with
   fellow Netflix showrunners Rhimes or Barris. "I think we're all working
   on our own stuff," he adds.

   Come September, Murphy will experience his first "drop" as a creator.
   As someone all too familiar with weekly watercooler buzz, he may have a
   difficult time adjusting to the burn-twice-as-bright-for-half-as-long
   binge model. "What we have all known as television — an episode drops a
   week, you promote the shit out of it, you drive down Sunset, there's
   your billboard," he says, "that's not the future." He's become privy to
   some of the streamer's proprietary insights, such as that people who
   view his shows on the platform also tend to watch Bob's Burgers. "Who
   knew?" he says. "That's millions and millions of people that I never
   would think."

   Of course, Murphy will continue to serve as his own publicity generator
   (not only through press but via his million-plus social media
   followers). "There is a lot of P.T. Barnum in Ryan," says Walden. "He's
   going to be able to teach Netflix a lot because he understands that
   process very well." Netflix already has been hosting private screenings
   of The Politician for media and influencers in an effort to drum up a
   word-of-mouth campaign. Sarandos made the rounds at the L.A. event at
   San Vicente Bungalows, as Tyra Banks, Rob Lowe and Ed Westwick mingled
   with the show's cast and creators. Paltrow appeared at one in the
   Hamptons, where she spends her summers, with her mother. "I'm
   definitely going to do some promotion," she says. "As little as I can
   get away with, but still."

   As Murphy learns to navigate the Netflix way, one emotionally charged
   subject he'll inevitably have to come to terms with is his relationship
   with ratings. That the streamer provided a safe harbor from them was an
   obvious draw for the showrunner, who calls the daily report card
   "absolute bullshit." But in the sort of twist you'd expect to find in
   one of his shows, Netflix has begun releasing metrics for some of its
   high-profile fare. Holland says they'll let Murphy see the viewership
   on his projects, should he want to — though he claims he doesn't. "I'm
   not interested in that," he says. "All I want to hear is let's do more
   or let's not." (Awards likely wouldn't hurt, either.) It's a peculiar
   stance for someone who was spellbound by the data-packed presentation
   Netflix dazzled him with in an early meeting (he still talks about the
   map with the blinking lights illustrating his global reach). Some of
   Murphy's closest collaborators, including Falchuk, don't buy it: "He's
   going to want to know."

   Back in the trailer, Murphy's phone buzzes, reminding him he's nearly
   late to a script meeting for one of his dozen projects. Ratched, Boys,
   Hollywood and The Prom (which stars Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman) are
   all in various stages of pre- to postproduction, and The Politician's
   second season starts up in October. He's also got three documentary
   projects, plus three other series in development at the streamer — to
   say nothing of his five 20th shows, most of which have second windows
   on Netflix. (There's even talk of a "Ryan Murphy" button or row on the
   platform, though the details have yet to be fleshed out.) What is clear
   is that for someone who works 18-hour days, relying on the occasional
   IV vitamin drip to stay healthy, the irony of Murphy's efforts to
   create more manageable workdays for cast and crew is apparent. "I will
   always be this person," he says. "I want to be Norman Lear. I want to
   work when I'm 96 years old."

Box Office: Why 'Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' Isn't Clicking

   February 11, 2019 6:40am by Pamela McClintock
   Skewing young, the sequel opened well behind expectations and at about
   half of its predecessor's earnings.

   There was nothing awesome about the box office debut of The Lego Movie
   2: The Second Part.

   The sequel opened to an estimated $34 million-$35 million in North
   America, well behind an expected $50 million to $55 million, and half
   as much as the 2014 film. Blame the movie's surprisingly soft
   performance on franchise fatigue, according to box office analysts. A
   less-than-inspired marketing campaign is another factor, analysts add.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   Lego Movie 2 is also struggling badly overseas, where it launched to
   $18 million from 63 territories for a worldwide bow of $53 million.
   Globally, the $100 million movie needs to earn $200 million-$225
   million to break even.

   It has been five years since The Lego Movie, directed by Phil Lord and
   Christopher Miller, opened to a huge $69 million. It took Lord and
   Miller, who wrote and directed 2009's animated Cloudy With a Chance of
   Meatballs for Sony and also directed 2012's live-action 21 Jump Street,
   to the next level. and it put Warners in the animation game.

   The studio responded by plotting two spinoffs that hit theaters within
   months of each other. The Lego Batman Movie started off with $53
   million domestically in February 2017, followed that September by The
   Lego Ninjago Movie with a cautionary debut of $20.3 million on its way
   to earning just $123 million worldwide.

   "I certainly think franchise fatigue is a major factor in the massive
   property devaluation of this WB franchise," says Jeff Bock of Exhibitor
   Relations. "Audiences probably could have done without Ninjago. And the
   truth of the matter is, five years is a long time. The Second Part
   seemed like a retread from the get-go, resting on the laurels of the
   original."

   Lord and Miller returned to write and produce The Second Part, but they
   weren't the only high-profile names to return. Lego Movie 2 sees Chris
   Pratt once again voice the role of everyman construction worker Emmet
   Brickowski, and Will Ferrell voice the evil Lord Business. Elizabeth
   Banks, Will Arnett, Alison Brie and Nick Offerman also reprise their
   roles, while new additions to the voice cast include Tiffany Haddish,
   Stephanie Beatriz and Maya Rudolph.

   There were no obvious warning sings that Lego Movie 2 was in trouble.
   Heading into the weekend, it boasted a Rotten Tomatoes score of 84
   percent. While that didn't match the 95 percent bestowed on the 2014
   movie, it's still a strong score.

   But when Friday box office returns started coming in, executives at
   Warners were rattled, both by the actual grosses and exit surveys
   revealing that the sequel was playing far younger than the first Lego
   Movie, which drew its strength from appealing to college students and
   adults, in addition to kids. This time, 48 percent of ticket buyers
   were under the age of 18, compared with 41 percent in 2014.

   "The marketing just seemed to be on autopilot. Look, I know Warner
   Bros. didn't feel like they had to sell the sequel, but the declining
   grosses for Lego Batman and Lego Ninjago should have been a huge red
   flag. Reconnecting with their core audience obviously didn't happen,"
   says Bock.

   "The more and more I look at this series, the original was likely an
   event because of the novelty," he continues. "You just can't cuddle a
   Lego."

Bob Odenkirk Teases 'Better Call Saul' Season 5: "Everything's on Fire and
It's Burning Down Around Us"

   10:00 AM PDT 8/20/2019 by Ciara McVey

     * YOUTUBE

The star also talks about the secrecy of the upcoming 'Breaking Bad' movie,
set to release on Netflix and AMC next year.

   In the world of AMC's Better Call Saul, the journey of Jimmy McGill
   becoming Saul Goodman has been a slow buildup for audiences, but the
   season four finale pushed it one step closer following McGill
   announcing he'll be practicing law under a different name: "S'all good,
   man."

   "They've been building it slowly but it's turning. Now it’s turning
   rapidly, I would say," Odenkirk told In Studio With The Hollywood
   Reporter of the AMC series, which earned 11 Emmy nominations, including
   best lead actor in a drama series. "That’s similar to Breaking Bad,
   too. This very slow buildup as we go up the roller-coaster ramp and
   then, it starts going downhill, it just cannot stop. And that's where
   we are in season five, which we’re shooting right now."

   "Season five is just everything's on fire, and it’s just burning down
   around us," he added.

   The constant uphill trek to becoming Saul Goodman had Odenkirk worried
   about audiences sticking with the series through the four seasons.

   "I was worried about the audiences staying with us. We asked people to
   watch closely and to understand on a deeper level the characters and
   the plot, and you know what? They did," he explained. "The audience
   really impressed the hell out of me. But I do think that it was all
   because of Breaking Bad and not just because of the success of Breaking
   Bad, but because people who watched Breaking Bad knew that every detail
   matters, the eye floating in the water, it means something. And so by
   getting a large audience to watch on that level, then when Better Call
   Saul started, they immediately were hooked into watching closely and
   not worrying about it getting somewhere but trusting that it would."

   Odenkirk also touched on the upcoming, highly anticipated Breaking Bad
   movie, a sequel involving Aaron Paul, set to release on AMC and Netflix
   in 2020.

   "I've heard so many different things about it, but I am excited about
   the Breaking Bad movie. I can't wait to see it," he told In Studio.

   Speaking on the secrecy surrounding the film, Odenkirk said, "I don't
   know what people know and don't know. I find it hard to believe you
   don't know it was shot. They did it. You know what I mean? How is that
   a secret? But it is. They've done an amazing job of keeping it a
   secret."

Miles Teller Nabs Goose's Son Role in 'Top Gun' Sequel

   July 03, 2018 12:06pm by Borys Kit
   Teller will star opposite Tom Cruise in the long-in-the works sequel
   that sees Cruise reprising his role as the hotshot pilot with the call
   sign Maverick.

   Miles Teller has landed the role of Goose's son in Top Gun 2 and will
   star opposite Tom Cruise, reprising his role from the 1986 original as
   the hotshot pilot with the call sign Maverick.

   Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in the sci-fi thriller Oblivion,
   is directing the long-in-the-works Top Gun sequel, which is also
   bringing back Val Kilmer's rival pilot code-named Iceman.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   The role of Goose's son was a coveted one and many of young Hollywood's
   finest were chasing it, even traveling to Cruise's home in Clearwater,
   Florida, for the testing process.

   Teller beat out Nicholas Hoult and Glen Powell for the role. Dylan
   O'Brien and Austin Butler were among those in the mix in a previous
   stage.

   Teller will play the son of Maverick's wingman and best pal, Goose.
   Played by Anthony Edwards in the Tony Scott-directed original, the
   character provides an emotional spine to the movie when he is killed by
   accident and Maverick blames himself.

   Teller last starred in a pair of gritty dramas, Thank You for Your
   Service and Only the Brave, the true-life firefighting movie that
   Kosinski directed. The Spectacular Now and Whiplash helped establish
   his chops early on.

Miles Teller Nabs Goose's Son Role in 'Top Gun' Sequel

   July 03, 2018 12:06pm by Borys Kit
   Teller will star opposite Tom Cruise in the long-in-the works sequel
   that sees Cruise reprising his role as the hotshot pilot with the call
   sign Maverick.

   Miles Teller has landed the role of Goose's son in Top Gun 2 and will
   star opposite Tom Cruise, reprising his role from the 1986 original as
   the hotshot pilot with the call sign Maverick.

   Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in the sci-fi thriller Oblivion,
   is directing the long-in-the-works Top Gun sequel, which is also
   bringing back Val Kilmer's rival pilot code-named Iceman.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   The role of Goose's son was a coveted one and many of young Hollywood's
   finest were chasing it, even traveling to Cruise's home in Clearwater,
   Florida, for the testing process.

   Teller beat out Nicholas Hoult and Glen Powell for the role. Dylan
   O'Brien and Austin Butler were among those in the mix in a previous
   stage.

   Teller will play the son of Maverick's wingman and best pal, Goose.
   Played by Anthony Edwards in the Tony Scott-directed original, the
   character provides an emotional spine to the movie when he is killed by
   accident and Maverick blames himself.

   Teller last starred in a pair of gritty dramas, Thank You for Your
   Service and Only the Brave, the true-life firefighting movie that
   Kosinski directed. The Spectacular Now and Whiplash helped establish
   his chops early on.

   Netflix Netflix Breaking Bad Breaking Bad
   The actor will return to the show's world in 'El Camino,' a sequel
   focusing on Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman.

   Jesse Pinkman's buddies are alive and well — or at least alive — in the
   Breaking Bad sequel movie.

   A teaser for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie features Skinny Pete
   (Charles Baker) refusing to tell police whether he knows Jesse's (Aaron
   Paul) whereabouts. Matt Jones, who played Jesse's friend and
   drug-dealing and -using partner Badger in the series, will also appear
   in the film, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

   Jones appeared in a dozen episodes across all five seasons of Breaking
   Bad's initial run on AMC. He was last seen in the series finale as he
   and Skinny Pete posed as unseen hitmen to help ensure Walter White's
   (Bryan Cranston) former business partners set up a trust for Walt's
   kids.

   Other details about El Camino, which will premiere Oct. 11 on Netflix
   and later air on AMC, are scarce. The description of the movie refers
   only to Jesse, saying, "In the wake of his dramatic escape from
   captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge
   some kind of future."

   In his last scene in the series, Jesse flees the neo-Nazi compound
   where he'd been imprisoned and forced to cook meth following Walt's
   final act to wipe out his partner's captors.

   Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan wrote and directed El Camino. Mark
   Johnson, Melissa Bernstein, Charles Newirth, Diane Mercer and Paul
   produce in association with series producer Sony Pictures TV.

   Following Breaking Bad, Jones went on to Chuck Lorre's CBS comedy Mom.
   Other recent credits include features Brightburn and The Turkey
   Bowl. He also appears in another Lorre comedy for CBS, Bob Hearts
   Abishola, which premieres Sept. 23.
