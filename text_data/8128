Dermatology - A Brief Overview

       Dermatology is a division of medicine or medical science that deals
       with various skin conditions, along with hair, sweat glands, and
       the other related parts of the body. Though dermatology is often
       considered to be a science dealing with skin and hair, it is quite
       a vast field and encompasses multiple subdivisions. Cosmetic
       dermatology, immunodermatology, etc. are some of the major
       dermatology branches.
       Cosmetic dermatology deals with the aesthetics and the cosmetic
       aspects of the skin. Immunodermatology, on the other hand, studies
       the skin conditions that are caused by the immune system. When
       people consult a dermatologist for a specific skin problem or
       condition, they are quite often referred by the doctor to a
       specialist doctor who has undergone intensive training and
       possesses appropriate skills to deal with the specific skin
       problem. Most people would have visited a dermatologist’s clinic
       like at least once in their lives, for problems such as dry skin,
       acne, hair fall, etc.
       For a professional career as a dermatologist, one would have to
       attend or undergo a four-year medical school degree course. The
       course would generally cover topics relating to anatomy, medicinal
       practice, and physiology. After completing the course, the future
       dermatologist or skin doctor would have to participate in a medical
       residency program, which would focus specifically on the
       dermatology practice. The candidate can also choose to take an
       additional residency in the sub specialty section of dermatology,
       like pediatric dermatology.
       The skin is probably the most important organ of a human body.
       However, most people tend to take their skin for granted. Almost
       every known medical condition has some sort of an affiliation or
       connection with the skin and its health. Dermatologists are, in
       fact, well-versed and skilled in a wide range of medical domains. A
       skin doctor can diagnose and detect the skin’s problem areas, and
       also prescribe a recommended treatment. For dry skin problems, the
       dermatologist would usually recommend changes in the diet,
       prescription of certain medicines, usage of oils and creams to
       condition and moisturize the skin. For conditions like moles, the
       skin specialist might order for a biopsy to determine whether the
       mole is malignant or not. If the mole proves to be cancerous or
       dangerous, the doctor might get the mole removed through a minor
       surgery or operation.
       As the skin is the most visible organ or part of a human body,
       cosmetic dermatology practices can be very profitable. This is
       because there are many people who seek the services of a cosmetic
       dermatologist just to alter the physical appearance of the skin.
       Cosmetic treatments are primarily done for non-medical conditions,
       which might not cause any significant harm to the person. For
       getting that desired look, the skin doctor would perform an array
       of medical procedures, ranging from Botox procedures to liposuction
       treatments. A cosmetic doctor not just alters or helps make minor
       changes to one’s physical shape and appearance. There have been
       multiple cases where radical differences have been brought into
       effect through a cosmetic procedure. People involved in
       life-threatening accidents or incidents, which might have caused
       major disfigurement, are usually the beneficiaries of such radical
       procedures. The doctor not just alters the physical aspects of the
       individual, but also brings about a massive change and improvement
       in the overall personality and self-confidence of the individual.
       The skin functions as a body’s primary line of defense. It is,
       therefore, important that one takes good care of his or her skin,
       so that the body continues to function normally or without any
       issues. An individual must visit a dermatologist’s clinic only if
       the person sees major changes in the skin’s appearance, or if there
       are issues such as dry skin, burn scars, spider veins, etc.
