Access Price and Performance Intelligence for Cloud Providers Around the
Globe.

   Cloud performance benchmarks give you the data you need to get the
   best-fit, best performing cloud for your business needs.

   Start Comparing Cloud Providers

Why Does Performance Matter?

   If you are considering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), one key
   question you need to ask is why does performance matter when evaluating
   the public cloud? Some provider VMs can achieve the same performance
   levels with fewer resources and this can have a substantial impact on
   cost.

   This graphic shows a basic scenario where a business would need a 4
   vCPU machine on Provider A to effectively run its application. However,
   on Provider B, a 2 vCPU machine would satisfy the same application
   requirements with a lower cost through fewer resources. The lowest
   priced provider will not always lead to the lowest costs.
