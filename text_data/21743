   Third in the early 2019/20 Premier League table and a first Champions
   League final appearance still fresh in the memory, it should be a good
   time to be a Tottenham Hotspur fan. And yet there are several concerns.
   Spurs’ domestic form since the start of 2019 has been poor – Mauricio

Four-step plan to save Tottenham's season for Pochettino

   today
    • by Tom Bodell

   email
   news now

   Mauricio Pochettino does not do subtlety.

   Last season the Tottenham Hotspur coach revealed he’d ‘never been so
   unhappy’ at the North London club. Then, prior to the Champions League
   final defeat to Liverpool, he dropped the bombshell that the game could
   have been his last at the helm.

   The Argentine’s mood has not been helped by Tottenham’s start to the
   season. Having won just two of their first six Premier League fixtures,
   matters were compounded by an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the
   hands of League Two’s Colchester United on Tuesday evening.

   “When you have an unsettled squad always it’s difficult and you lose
   time, then you need time to recover the time you lose,” Pochettino said
   after defeat in Essex.

   “That’s where we are. Maybe our performances are good but you need this
   extra, which is mental, connection. It’s energy to be all together, not
   to have different agendas in the squad.

   Asked what the solution was, Pochettino told Sky Sports News: “Only we
   need time. January is going to be a good opportunity too to fix this
   situation and the next one. That is the problem when something happens
   that you cannot control.”

   Tottenham Hotspur's Argentinian head coach Mauricio Pochettino reacts
   in their Champions League draw against Olympiacos

   After finally ending their self-imposed transfer ban to sign Tanguy
   Ndombele for a club-record fee, as well as taking Giovani Lo Celso on
   loan from Real Betis with the option to buy and signing Fulham
   wonderkid Ryan Sessegnon for £25million, the feeling was Tottenham had
   enjoyed a good summer transfer window.

   Eight games into the new season and everything is unravelling. We’ve
   taken a look at what Spurs have to do now, and in January, to get their
   season back on track.

1. Make a decision at right-back

   Given he was not universally popular at Tottenham anyway, it’s
   remarkable how badly Spurs have missed Kieran Trippier. The England
   international’s move to Atlético Madrid has left a hole at right-back
   which has yet to be filled on a full-time basis.

   Centre-half Davinson Sánchez has looked uncomfortable on the right
   while Kyle Walker-Peters has been unable to prove he is Trippier’s
   long-term heir.

   Tottenham Hotspur defender Serge Aurier has forced his way into the
   thinking of Mauricio Pochettino once more

   That has opened the door for Serge Aurier. The Ivorian was well down
   the pecking order last season and made just six Premier League starts.
   A bundle of energy and excitement going forward, regular defensive
   lapses rendered him a non-option in the biggest games and Trippier held
   onto the No.2 spot despite failing to build on his World Cup displays
   with England.

   Now Aurier is enjoying a renaissance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He
   marked his first start of the season by forcing an own goal in the 4-0
   demolition of Crystal Palace and recorded an assist for Heung-min Son’s
   cushioned volley.

   Pochettino needs to give the former Paris Saint-Germain full-back a run
   in the side – something he’s not had since arriving in the 2018 January
   transfer window.

2. Make peace with wantaway stars

   Christian Eriksen's stats for Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League
   since 2016

   Christian Eriksen has made no secret of his desire to embark on a new
   project. The Dane is out of contract next summer and if Spurs cannot
   sell him in January, he will walk away for nothing. The same is likely
   to go for Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen – both their deals
   expire in June 2020.

   Spurs will not pay the kind of salaries that might persuade the trio to
   stay and it appears a foregone conclusion this is their final season
   with the club. But they are still of use to Spurs and Pochettino must
   ensure he utilises them while he can.

   Vertonghen was bizarrely left out of Tottenham’s first three Premier
   League fixtures before finally returning for the North London derby.
   While Pochettino has high hopes for the defensive axis of Sánchez and
   Juan Foyth, Alderweireld and Vertonghen remain his strongest pairing.

   As for Eriksen, the 27-year-old remains one of the Premier League’s
   finest creators. In the last three seasons (2016/17-2018/19), no
   midfielder in England’s top-flight racked up more assists (37), more
   shot assists from open play (170) or set-pieces (73), while he was
   second for big chances created (43) and third for crosses completed
   (139).

   The Real Madrid and Juventus target underlined his value to Tottenham
   when he came off the bench on the opening weekend, turning a 1-0 defeat
   at home to Aston Villa into a 3-1 win with a masterful display. Spurs
   and Pochettino must enjoy his creative genius while they can.

3. Get Dele Alli back to his best

   At one point in the not-too-distant past, the former MK Dons midfielder
   was the golden boy of English football. But at just 23 he’s almost been
   forgotten thanks to a combination of form and fitness, allowing the
   likes of James Maddison and Mason Mount to supersede him.

   Alli’s numerical output has dwindled in recent seasons and his only
   appearances this term have come in the Champions League and Carabao
   Cup.

   After bagging a career-best 18 Premier League goals in 2016/17, as well
   as weighing in with seven assists, Alli scored nine times and set up
   ten more in 2017/18. Yet last term he managed just three and five
   respectively.

   Dele Alli's heatmaps for the past two seasons at Tottenham Hotspur
   compared

   Contrasting Alli’s heatmaps for the last two seasons we can see that in
   2018/19 the England international saw greater involvement in deeper
   areas and a higher volume of activity down the left than through the
   centre. On top of that, he took marginally fewer touches in the
   opposition box per 90 (4.91 vs. 4.94) and fewer shots (1.91 vs. 2.09).

   If – more, more likely, when – Eriksen leaves Alli would be the most
   natural replacement, albeit he’s a different type of player, so
   Pochettino must find a way to help Alli rediscover his best form for
   Tottenham.

4. Find a willing and able deputy to Harry Kane

   It’s an annual problem for Pochettino and Spurs. Namely, finding a
   striker good enough to push Kane and occasionally stand in for him
   who’s happy at being a substitute more often than not.

   Fernando Llorente fulfilled that role until this summer and did better
   than any other incumbent of this graveyard shift – who could forget his
   role in Spurs reaching their first Champions League final? – but the
   34-year-old left North London to try his luck in Serie A with Napoli
   this summer, leaving Tottenham short.

   Lucas Moura and Son can play through the middle, and Moura bagged a
   respectable eight in 18 playing as a centre-forward in the Premier
   League, but it’s neither’s preferred or natural position and they both
   lack the line-leading presence of Kane.

   If it wasn’t already an onerous enough task for Tottenham’s recruitment
   department, having to do so in January when decent strikers are more of
   a commodity than ever will only serve to complicate matters.
