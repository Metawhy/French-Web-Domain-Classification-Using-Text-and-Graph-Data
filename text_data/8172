Welcome Message

   [Antonio_Manzalini.jpg]

   As the Chairman of the Technical Programme Committee, I invite you to
   participate in the ICIN 2017 conference on ‘Innovations in Clouds,
   Internet and Networks’, scheduled on March 7-9, 2017 in Paris.

   Since 1989 the ICIN conferences have been bringing together leading
   internet and telecom experts from industry, universities and government
   worldwide. The ICIN2017 edition is embracing several main aspects about
   the ongoing digital business transformation of Telecommunications. In
   fact, SDN and NFV are two enabling technologies of an overall systemic
   transformation called “Softwarization” which is steering the evolution
   both of Networks and Service Platforms (e.g., through Cloud and Edge
   Computing architectures) even up to future terminals, machines and
   smart objects (e.g., through Fog Computing). ICIN2017 will focus on
   some key areas of this systemic transformation: architectural
   delayering, simplifications and optimization of the operational
   processes (e.g., through orchestrators and new paradigms of OSS/BSS
   capable of managing the complexity and heterogeneity of SDN and NFV
   infrastructures), development of flexible and programmable “platforms
   of platforms”, the exploitation of Big Data by means of data mining and
   cognitive technologies. If mastering the software is recognized a must
   for a successful digital business transformation, standardization of
   open source software solutions and interfaces is still felt to be a hot
   issue to be discussed during the Conference.

   The 31 accepted papers, together with the 5 keynotes speeches, were
   organized into four technical Tracks: Network and Service IT-zation,
   Internet of Things, Actionable Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,
   Control Orchestration and Management and Policy. The scientific success
   of the workshop was due to hard work of a lot of people. Our
   appreciations goes to the Authors of the papers, the keynote Speakers,
   the Track Chairs and the Members of the Technical Program, Steering
   Committees and the IAB.

   Sincerely,
   Antonio Manzalini
   ICIN 2017 TPC Chair
