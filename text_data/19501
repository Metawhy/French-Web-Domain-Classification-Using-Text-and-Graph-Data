You can help!

Become a Sponsor

   As a non-profit, we rely on the tech industry to invest in youth
   innovators. Sponsors are needed to ensure we can provide this free
   program to our LGBT+ youth community. With corporate funding it allows
   us to grow our programs into other cities and provide internships for
   youth tech leaders.

Volunteer

   Volunteers are the backbone of any non-profit. We seek tech
   professionals, LGBT+ youth workers, and non-profit partners to build
   our programs nationally.

Host a Day of Camp

   Throughout the year we look to partner with tech driven companies to
   host our events and camps. If you have space and can provide meals we
   would love to chat about how to bring a group of our amazing youth to
   your company to meet tech professionals.
   Be a Host
