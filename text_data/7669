Postdocs & Graduate Students Present at Annual CIERA Research Jamboree

   Posted December 15, 2016

   For the fourth year in December, CIERA faculty, postdocs, graduate
   students and guests gathered before the annual CIERA holiday party to
   hear short presentations on the wide array of research conducted here
   by Postdoctoral Fellows and Graduate Students. The Research Jamboree
   provides an opportunity to hear about colleagues’ latest interests,
   projects, and results in a quick-paced format that allows time for
   questions as well as discussions during breaks. This year’s 21 talks
   included research such as modeling habitability criteria of Earth-like
   planets, determining planet mass by analyzing spiral waves, and making
   observations with a balloon-borne telescope in Antarctica.

Database Celebrates the Presence of African American Women in Physics

   Posted June 4, 2019

   Fewer than 100 African American women have received PhDs in physics.
   African American Women in Physics (AAWIP) lists their names and
   provides resources for students, job seekers, and departments.

   By maintaining a list of all of the African American women with PhDs
   who identify as physicists, the organization highlights the wide
   variety of academic backgrounds and career options for physics students
   and professionals. With the expected awarding later this year of the
   100th physics PhD to an African American woman, AAWIP is both
   celebrating the trailblazing accomplishments of those who earned their
   degrees and emphasizing the progress that will be necessary to make the
   list grow far more quickly.

   CIERA postdoctoral associate Erin Cox was featured as a recent graduate
   in a commentary about the database on Physics Today.

   Continue to the Physics Today article, “Commentary: Celebrating and
   supporting African American women in physics” by Jami Valentine Miller.

Media Seek Expertise on New Planets in TRAPPIST-1 System

   Posted February 28, 2017

   Local astronomers, in their roles here at CIERA and at Chicago’s Adler
   Planetarium, received a flurry of press requests for interviews and
   quotations in relation to the discovery of a system of
   exoplanets announced by NASA in February. Though CIERA’s researchers
   were not directly involved in the discovery of the seven new planets,
   their ability to communicate its meaning to the public was invaluable
   to local press.

   Adler Planetarium Director of Citizen Science and CIERA Postdoctoral
   Research Affiliate, Laura Trouille, was interviewed about Planet
   Hunters and other Zooniverse citizen science projects on National
   Public Radio’s Science Friday February 24 (hear the segment here; Dr.
   Trouille begins at about 9 minutes in).

   Aaron Geller, NSF Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow, was
   interviewed by Chicago CBS 2 in the Adler’s Solar System gallery (see
   photo, left). Aaron also gave two radio interviews: 101 WKQX in the
   morning of February 23, and 1690 am WVON that evening. View Aaron’s
   Facebook Live video, courtesy of Adler Planetarium:
