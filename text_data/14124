   Autumn Transition
   Sep 20, 2019

   The time of year where you need an extra layer but the sun is still out
   and it‚Äôs not quite time to put your summer wardrobe completely away. I
   like to mix and match, in this case: a lightweight knit with linen
   pants.

   RECIPE : Sungold Tomato Pasta (VIDEO)
   Sep 15, 2019

   As the last hints of summer permeate the air, I implore you to get your
   fix of tomatoes. Thin, juicy skins, barely able to hold their fruit,
   and sweet as can be! Poured over pasta, married with basil, or simply
   sliced and decorated with coarse salt, now is the time to make the most
   of these final days of tomato season.

   Daily Hair Routine
   Sep 8, 2019

   It has been a little while since I have an updated post on my hair
   routine. But I thought I would break down the steps and what products I
   have been loving to achieve this look.

   Everyday Jewelry
   Aug 31, 2019

   I have always been pretty minimalist when it comes to jewelry. I like
   simple, gold pieces that can be layered and worn together. What I have
   learned over the years is how jewelry really personalizes your style.

   You know when you have one of those moments where you look around your
   house and think I‚Äôd like to start from scratch? I had one of those this
   weekend, after going through and cleaning and editing. I think, like
   anything, personal style evolves.

   Timeless Classic : The White Shirt

   Back to our regularly scheduled programming! I took a little vacation
   to the East Coast and now I am back and more inspired than ever and
   have a long list of ideas for the blog! Today‚Äôs subject is the white
   button down shirt, an item that I am ashamed to admit I really did not

   RECIPE | Peaches and Burrata with Basil

   RECIPE | Peaches and Burrata with Basil
   Jul 28, 2019

   As we start getting towards the height of summer, peaches are at their
   peak. I love using them to make warm crumbles, grilled with pork,
   whirred into bbq sauce, ‚Ä¶. But sometimes when they are so juicy they
   are begging to be eaten, I like to make this dish with the simple
   flavors of summer.

   Summer Linen Staples
   Jul 26, 2019

   What to wear when it gets hot and humid: linen is my choice. Anything
   light and breezy, that doesn‚Äôt feel too snug or tight. I have been
   loving my finds at & Other Stories. It is similar to a Zara, but their
   clothes feels more edited and better quality with a good price point.

   The Beauty Bag Edit
   Jul 11, 2019

   I wanted to do a breakdown of what has been in the rotation of my
   beauty bag. I have some old favorites, but also some new ones that I
   have really been loving. My focus is always on the complexion, if there
   is a beautiful canvas, then everything else falls into place.
