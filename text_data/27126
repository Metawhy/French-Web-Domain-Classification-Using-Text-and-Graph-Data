What is an email newsletter?

   Basically, an email newsletter is a type of email sent out by companies
   or individuals to a subscriber list (existing or potential customers
   that have signed up to receive marketing communications) that’s
   contains valuable content (guides, blog posts, news, products reviews,
   personal recommendations, tips, announcements and other resources).

   Newsletters are an essential part of the email marketing strategy, as
   they allow businesses to nurture their contacts, by establishing
   themselves as key players in their industry, sharing insights and
   highlighting new products that will drive traffic to the website.

What are the advantages and the drawbacks of sending an email newsletter?

   The immense popularity of email newsletters isn’t a coincidence. Email
   marketing is one of the most effective marketing channels. The average
   ROI is £38 for each pound invested and 72% of customers prefer to be
   approached via email. Well-designed marketing emails sent regularly,
   like email newsletters, guarantee constant website traffic, webinars
   and other event registrations and product sales. As newsletters
   statistically form the largest part of all marketing emails sent, they
   hold a great deal of marketing potential.

   Wondering whether setting up an email newsletter is the right step for
   your business? Let’s have a look at the advantages and drawbacks of
   sending one!

Strengths of sending an email newsletters

   Creating a newsletter is not just a way to keep your customers informed
   about your new product or features, but has many other advantages.

A newsletter is a constant source of traffic

   One of the main reasons for creating a newsletter is that it generates
   regular website traffic. Organic engagement on social media platforms
   like Facebook is declining dramatically. Banner advertising is rarely
   noticed in the era of ad blockers. Written press releases sent by email
   will often be ignored by journalists and online editors.

   Luckily, this is not true for newsletters. Emails that reach someone’s
   inbox are usually seen, and the likelihood that they will be opened is
   high, provided that the subject line is appealing and the sender is
   recognized (so make sure your readers know who you are!). If your
   newsletter is well designed and it contains relevant content, this will
   enhance your chances of the reader clicking on the calls-to-action for
   more information.


Email Newsletter generates considerable savings

   Money is important for marketers. So anything that saves you money
   should be a top priority. And newsletters do.

   Don’t underestimate how much money email marketing saves you, compared
   to other using other marketing tools. Paid advertisements like banner
   advertising, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads and influencer marketing are
   considerably more expensive than email newsletter marketing. The cost
   of a newsletter software is usually low and labor costs are also lower,
   as the newsletter is created and optimized faster than other media.

Easy performance measurement

   The success of a marketing tool is based on whether it reaches the
   required relevance or not. And in order to find out, performance must
   be measurable.

   Measuring the performance of an email newsletter is simple. Your email
   statistics provide you with all the information you need to do this:
   open rates, click rates, unsubscribe rates, bounces, which user
   terminals were used to open the newsletter and when, which links are
   clicked on, etc. These KPIs will help you accurately calculate your ROI
   and produce target-audience relevant newsletter content.

Independence from third parties

   When you create a newsletter, you are independent from other service
   providers and softwares. Publishers and influencers, as well as social
   media platforms and Google, are much more likely to increase ads cost
   than an email service provider is to increase the cost of its product.
   And even if they do, prices usually only increase by a small amount.
   With other marketing tools, increases are usually in the three, if not
   four, digit range.

Easily linked to other online marketing channels

   Newsletters and other marketing tools such as social media can be
   easily and effectively combined. And they can reach recipients
   anywhere, regardless of whether they are in the office on their work
   computer, on the sofa at home on a tablet, or on the go on their
   smartphone, emails can be opened and read anywhere.

Targeted customer care

   And if all of the above reasons are not enough on their own, the
   combination of all of them proves that emails are a great medium for
   targeting audiences and customer care. 😉


Weaknesses of sending an email newsletters

   Where there’s yin, there is yan. Or in other words, where there is
   light, there is also darkness. Even if email newsletters provide many
   benefits, they also have a few shortcomings.

Absence of physical haptics when sending an email newsletter

   Unlike with analog advertising media like brochures, flyers, magazines,
   etc. there is no haptic experience with email newsletters. For
   instance, a desk calendar is visibly looked at all year round. Emails,
   on the other hand, do not have a physical presence. This makes them
   less durable, but also less annoying to sort and organize. 😉

Ease of newsletter deletion

   The fact that emails tend to be deleted more quickly and less
   intensively read than other media cannot be denied. There are many
   reasons for this: a full inbox, unappealing subject lines, content that
   is not relevant, etc.

   Although these inhibiting elements can be minimized, except for the
   first one, a 100% interaction rate can never be guaranteed. This is
   true not only for newsletters. but for all marketing tools.

   However, if we weigh up the benefits and drawbacks of newsletters, it
   quickly becomes clear that the benefits by far outweigh the drawbacks.

How to create an effective email newsletter

   OK, so we have convinced you to give newsletters a go. Hooray! To help
   you make the most of your new favorite marketing channel, we’ve
   detailed below all you need to know to plan an effective newsletter
   strategy that’ll make your contacts wish all their emails were like
   yours. 😏


Defining an email newsletter strategy: Set your goals and objectives

   First things first, before you even start designing your newsletter
   template, you’ll need to think about why you want to implement one.
   Consider the following elements to ensure you’re crafting the right
   messages.

Identify a target audience for your email newsletter strategy

   A key starting point in building your newsletter strategy is to
   consider who you want to reach with your message.

   Defining your audience is essential to the success of your campaign
   because you need to understand what needs and wants your potential
   readers have in order to meet these with a fitting offer in your
   emails. You need to provide value in your newsletters that appeals to
   your audience.

   So think about who you want to reach with your emails and try to be as
   specific as possible. Consider things like demographics, location, and
   interests. If you’re aiming at reaching a global audience it can be
   hard to get precise in your definition, but in that case you need to
   craft a message that appeals to a broad audience.

Determine basic objectives for your email newsletter

   The next step is focused on goals. Think, what do you want to achieve
   with your email newsletter campaign? Some companies launch newsletters
   to drive traffic to their website, others want to increase sales on
   their online shop, or to invite people to upcoming events.

   Setting goals gives your newsletter campaign a purpose and helps you
   measure the performance of your efforts. These specific objectives
   depend on your individual company’s goals, your vision, and values.

   When setting these objectives, it can be useful to follow the SMART
   principle, an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,
   Time bound. Essentially though, you need to set goals that make sense
   to your business, so spend as much time as you need on this step. It’ll
   be worth it!

   Once you have defined your objectives, you need to determine the
   corresponding KPIs. If you’re not sure where to start, you might want
   to consider some of the most typical metrics measured for newsletters:
   newsletter subscriptions, open rates, click rates, spam and block
   rates, as well as newsletter unsubscribe rates 💔.
   KPI Framework Corresponding KPIs Newsletter


Define rough content

   Planning the topic of your newsletter is closely connected to the
   objectives you have defined, but coming up with content can be hard at
   first.

   To find inspiration, analyze your competitors’ newsletters (of course,
   avoid copying it and concentrate on what else you can offer to make
   yours better 💪) and newsletters of companies that you think are
   successful at email marketing. This is likely to give you inspiration
   about new potential topics, products, events etc.

   Another recommended method is to carry out a survey in advance, and to
   continue asking your contacts to share their thoughts as you grow your
   newsletter list. At Mailjet, we do this to ensure we are always
   providing the kind of content our subscribers want to read, and we love
   reading their feedback.

   If you’re just starting one, ask your target audience and customers
   what content they want to see and what are their expectations for a
   potential newsletter. If you want to incentivize customers to complete
   it, consider giving away freebies or discounts.

Use the right platform for your newsletter

   Before you start creating newsletters, you need to have the means to do
   it. This means that you need a newsletter solution that allows you to
   create, send and analyze email campaigns.

   Of course, there are a number of other ways to create and send
   newsletters for free (among others, WordPress’ PHP), which allow you to
   send emails directly from the backend. Some of these solutions also
   provide SMTP relay. However, it’s is not your best option, as they
   can’t provide the same standards when it comes to deliverability (that
   is, the ability to send emails to a user’s inbox).

   For security reasons, numerous solutions only allow for limited
   sending. Normally, under 100 recipients. A larger number of emails
   creates queues, which lead to delays or errors. In the worst cases,
   emails don’t get sent. On top of this, these softwares also lack some
   of the most basic.

   This means you should definitely look for an email service provider
   that can help you achieve your email goals. The problem is that there
   are many professional newsletter solutions on the market, which can be
   both a curse and a blessing for senders. On the one hand, you have a
   wide variety of suitable email providers to choose from. On the other
   hand, vetting them may feel a bit overwhelming.

   But as usual, at Mailjet, we’ve got you covered and have some useful
   tips to help you. When you’re looking for your ESP, make sure it
   includes the following functions, among others:

How to Build your newsletter subscriber lists before creating an email
newsletter

   In order to be able to create and send a newsletter, you obviously need
   recipients (duh!). Setting up an email contact list with high
   interaction rates is relatively simple if you take certain factors into
   consideration.

How to add subscription widgets to your site

   To gain new newsletter subscribers, the first thing you’ll need is a
   responsive subscription widget with a double opt-in process. Add the
   subscription widget to all the relevant pages of your website. Some of
   the most effective places to include your widget in are the homepage,
   the blog, the footer and pages with gated content, such as guides,
   white papers, and others.
   Subscription Widget Setup Mailjet’s Newsletter Widget Creation

   Double opt-in ensures that no fake email address creeps into your
   database and damages your reputation and deliverability. If you’re not
   doing this, you risk being classified as a spammer both by recipients
   and the ISPs themselves. The result will be that not only your
   newsletter but all the campaigns you have sent will be blocked.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tRXHZKwuYA

Don’t buy email lists

   Giving in to the temptation of buying email addresses will result in
   the same scenario. Buying email contacts from third parties is one of
   the most widely used methods to generate a contact list. Many companies
   still believe that an email contact list must be as large as possible
   in order to have relevant success. This is by no means true, trust us.
   Buying contact lists is essentially a waste of money.

   People included in such lists usually don’t want to hear from you at
   all and don’t know that you have obtained their email address until
   they receive the first newsletter. The result is annoyed recipients and
   blocked emails.

Create newsletter landing pages

   Besides implementing a responsive subscription widget, special
   newsletter landing pages are a great way to grow contact lists. These
   pages enable you to use all optimization opportunities that apply to
   landing pages. The potential newsletter subscriber is not distracted
   from other elements on the website and they concentrate on all the
   great reasons you’ll give them to convince them your newsletter is the
   best thing that has been written after Harry Potter.

Explore other channels to develop your newsletter contacts list

   Aside from adding a widget on your site or a dedicated landing page,
   there are other ways of growing your email list, such us promoting it
   on your social media platforms, incentivising existing subscribers to
   share or encouraging people to join at events or at your physical
   store.

   Consider what benefits prospective recipients may have if they
   subscribe to your newsletter. Ideally, you have already clarified these
   reasons in your strategy. Bear in mind that arguments like ‘100% free’,
   ‘no spam messaging’ or ’subscription can be canceled at any time with a
   single click’ are not actual benefits.

   Real added value, for example, is provided by things like special
   offers, advanced information and booking facilities, invitations to
   exclusive events, regular industry information, access to exclusive
   content like e-books, email mini-courses, etc.

Build your email contacts list properly: Get consent from your contacts

   But remember, regardless of how you’re getting your subscribers, you
   should always ask for consent before adding anyone to your email
   database. Remember what data protection and spam laws (like GDPR) say
   about consent, and ensure you’re complying with the applicable
   regulations.

   you can check this complete guide.

Segment your contacts for better targeting

   Instead of sending the same message to all of your customers, leverage
   segmentation to make the most of your emails. Think about how you can
   use the information you have about your customers to create segments,
   to be able to narrow down your target audience and send more tailored
   email campaigns that really speak to a specific group within your
   database.

Build your segments for your email newsletter

   The main question you will want to answer is what kind of data you want
   to use for segmentation. The answer to that isn’t really clear-cut,
   since it depends on your business and how you’re planning to group your
   contacts for your email campaigns. So, to determine the kind of data to
   use, think about what would make sense for your business. Consider if
   there are some obvious ways to group your customers based on different
   characteristics.

   To give you some inspiration, here are a few examples of the kind of
   data you can use:

   CAPTION: Examples of data segmentation you can use for your newsletter
   subscriber list

   Demographic data Psychographic data   Behavioral data
   Gender           Product Preferences Past Purchases
   Location         Interests           Average spending
   Age              Lifestyle           Purchase Frequency

   With information like this, you’re able to pinpoint the kind of segment
   you want to create. If you want to get even more specific about your
   segments, you can combine different types of data and create even more
   precise groups. For example, you could focus on only women that prefer
   shopping for shoes and that have made at least five purchases over the
   past six months.

   Once you have different groups of customers with similar
   characteristics, interests or habits, it will be easier to understand
   the each segment and thereby craft messages that resonate well with
   each one.

Craft your newsletter message

   Now that you have your segments, it’s time to put them to use. As you
   start planning your campaign, consider how you can create a message
   based on these segments. Essentially, you want your campaign to match
   the segment you’re sending it to, so always keep your audience in mind.

   To follow the different data types suggested above, here are some ideas
   of how you could match your message with each segment:

   CAPTION: Ideas to craft your newsletter message according to different
   segments

   Demographic Segments Psychographic Segments Behavioral Segments
   Send information about gender-specific products Highlight a certain
   product category to each segment Send product recommendations or
   special sales similar to previous purchases
   Share special events or deals in the city or area of each segment Focus
   on products that go with each interest group Offer a discount to
   customers that spend above a certain amount
   Share different products or offers specific to each age group Offer
   products that match a certain lifestyle Encourage customers that
   haven’t made a purchase in a longer period of time to come back with a
   special offer

   By matching up the segment with a fitting message, your campaigns will
   be much more targeted and take into account the different
   characteristics, preferences and needs of your customers.

   Segmentation is a powerful tool because it lets you slice a big contact
   list up into small, precise chunks. Also, you will be able to respond
   to the behavior and preferences of your customers and thereby create a
   much more customized and personalized experience for them.


How to design a beautiful newsletter

   The first step to creating a newsletter is setting up an email
   template. You can use a newsletter template provided by your email
   service provider (ours are pretty cool! 😎) and adapt it as necessary to
   match your brand image and your needs.

   Alternatively, you can upload a newsletter template you have already
   created or that you have bought from a third party. In this case, make
   sure that the selected layout is responsive so that your email
   campaigns will be perfectly displayed on every end device.

   Ready to dive in? There are five main things to consider when designing
   an email:

Think about content in your email newsletter before anything else

   The first and main thing to consider when putting a newsletter template
   together is content. Is it relevant to your audience? Is it engaging
   enough? Does it follow your brand guidelines? Keep your content brief
   and to the point as you only have the reader’s attention for a small
   amount of time.

   How: Use images on top of your email to capture the reader’s attention,
   followed by brief text and a clear call to action.

   ‘Firezza’, an amazing pizza delivery company.


Email Newsletter: First impressions matter

   We’ve talked a lot about how, just as the saying goes, first
   impressions really do matter when it comes to the subject line. 35% of
   recipients open emails based on subject line alone. So, firstly start
   thinking about your ‘From Name’. Don’t necessarily just use your
   company name or your department name. If your email is the vault and
   the content inside is the treasure, your subject line is the key to
   that vault.

   How: Know your audience, personalize and A/B test to find the best
   subject lines for your users.

Keep your email newsletter simple

   Give your newsletters a set structure, for example one feature area and
   two smaller columns below. Don’t cram your email with too much
   information as it won’t be appealing to the reader. Provide plenty of
   white space and keep your newsletter simple and neat. Try and keep a
   similar format your newsletters as users come to expect the same look
   and feel over time. If you work with different types of newsletters,
   you will need to use different newsletter designs, but remember to
   provide consistency with the same use of colors, font and hierarchy.
   This ensures clarity and professionalism.

   A clear structure ensures that subscribers grasp the content and core
   message(s) immediately. Insert your company logo in the upper section
   so that the readers immediately associate the newsletter to you. Add
   images in order to attract the readers’ attention, followed by a brief
   text and a clear calls-to-action.
   Newsletter structure template

   Clearly separate the upper section, main body and the footer of your
   newsletter from each other. Where appropriate, use images or color
   contrasts to carry out visual separation. Ensure that the embedded
   links have sufficient space between them in order to avoid erroneous
   clicks.

   How: To have your email render on various devices, be mindful of your
   email size. Ideal width is between 500 – 680 px. Smart Insight’s handy
   infographic sums up a range of email design best practices to follow.

Think about your email newsletter colors

   As we discovered in a previous post, each gender responds uniquely to
   different colors. Be mindful of which hues you choose for your images,
   background color, font and call to action buttons. After making sure
   that you’re keeping true to your brand identity, think about your
   audience. Using specific colors based on your demographic, you can
   improve your results and ultimately ROI.

   How: The more you know your customers, the better you can tailor your
   emails. To gather information from your existing customers, try running
   surveys as part of a raffle or competition. You’ll find most users are
   willing to spend two minutes to tell you about themselves for a chance
   to win something they want.

Don’t be pushy in your newsletter

   If you want your users to take action through your emails, don’t be too
   pushy with your call-to-action buttons. Imagine your calls-to-action is
   a sales assistant in a shop. Are you likely to trust one that’s being
   pushy, trying to get you to try on a pair shoes or buy a specific
   blouse? Or do you trust the one where they’re informational, subtle,
   yet suggestive? Same applies here.

   First start with a main call-to-action and modestly place it after the
   main content of your email or as a link within your textual content. If
   you have to add more than one call to action button, place this to the
   right or lower than the main call to action and make it slightly less
   obvious.

   How: Think about the placement of your CTAs (calls-to-action). Through
   studies we can see that CTAs placed at the bottom of the email ramp up
   higher click rates than on the right or left of the email. Also make
   sure it has relevant text. For example, you may find emails sent to a
   certain demographic may prefer ‘Purchase Now’ to ‘Buy Now’. Research,
   test and compare your campaigns to improve your call-to-actions.
   Netflix is one of our all-time favorites.

   Netflix’s email design ticks all the boxes. It uses personalization in
   the subject line to get me to open it and uses a catchy image on top of
   the email to get me hooked. The content is based on Netflix knowing I’m
   interested in anything ‘Breaking Bad’ related and follows the same
   color scheme as the Netflix dashboard. Finally has effective and not
   too pushy call-to-action buttons.

Tailor your email newsletter message

   An essential part in email design is the content featured in the
   newsletter. Yes, this might sound obvious, but it’s still forgotten by
   many, that think that a flashy design is enough to wow their contacts.

   Before jumping into writing amazing copy, though, you’ll need to think
   about those unsung heroes that can make the difference between an email
   being opened or ignored. We’re talking about the secret weapons of
   email: the From Name, the Subject Line and the Preheader.
   Newsletter Content Newsletter content


Choose a From Name to send your email newsletter

   We already mentioned before how important From Names are. The average
   email user receives almost 125 emails every day. If you want your
   newsletter to be noticed by your subscribers, you’ll need to devote
   most attention to your From Name.

   You should definitely include your brand name, either by choosing a
   non-personal name like ‘Mailjet Marketing Team’ or the combination of
   your own and your company’s name. If you’re a personal brand, only
   using your own name is conceivable.
   SenderNameExample

Formulate a Subject Line to optimize your newsletter open rate

   After the From Name has been chosen (and it should stay the same for
   all future newsletters, unless you’re testing out different ones),
   you’ll need to concentrate on the subject line. Along with the sender’s
   name, the subject line determines whether or not your newsletter will
   be opened.

   Remember that the tone and language should match the style of your
   brand. Be bold and try out something new. Being cheeky, using
   questions, citing the recipient’s name, or even adding emojis, all jazz
   up the subject line and draw attention to your newsletter. As you’re
   are probably very reluctant to be labeled as a spammer, avoid using
   words that can trigger the spam alarm. 😉

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZnN3D1dzp2Y


Write the Preheader

   The Preheader is the third text element that you’ll need to customize.
   Together with the Subject Line, it summarizes the email content and
   motivates the recipient to pay attention to your newsletter.

   Make sure the Preheader doesn’t just repeat the message on the Subject
   Line, but that they work together to incite the readers and encourage
   them to open your email

Create your email newsletter content

   It is now time for the core text: the heart of the newsletter content.
   Remember that the content you share in your emails should be directly
   linked to your goals and objectives.

   Whether you got inspiration from other newsletters or by conducting a
   survey, carefully map out the messages you want to share and consider
   you’ll communicate these to your audience. Define your email voice and
   the stories you want to tell, paying special attention to your copy.

   Need some content ideas for your newsletter? Here are a few:
     * Promoting the latest blog articles.
     * New freebies like guides, white papers, studies, etc.
     * Invitations to seminars, webinars, and other events.
     * Special marketing campaigns like advent calendars, yearly calendars
       etc.

Email Newsletter: Define your key messages

   The newsletter is one of the few types of email that can draw attention
   to multiple pieces of content. However, make sure not to promote too
   much at the same time. Several researches have shown that the majority
   of recipients click on the first call-to-action.

   Therefore, you must always have your primary objective in mind when
   creating your newsletter. Place the most important information first,
   and organizing the rest following a clear hierarchy. The more
   subscribers have to scroll down, the higher the likelihood that content
   further down will not receive any attention.

Use images wisely in your newsletter

   Images and other visual elements optically enhance the newsletter. But
   beware! Too many graphical elements can impact negatively on your
   deliverability, as this is a favored tactic of spammers. ISPs know this
   well, and often block emails containing large images. So always aim for
   a healthy 60:40 balance between text and graphics.

   Another important advice to keep in mind is to remember to add Alt tags
   to the images and scale them down to the size you want. Bear in mind
   that some email clients block images, so that subscribers just see a
   large white area. By adding Alt tags, they’ll at least get an idea of
   what they should be looking at.

   Likewise, some newsletter software packages distort large images. This
   means that these images have to be modified afterwards with an image
   editing program, which is really time-consuming. If you use a
   newsletter solution with integrated image editing programs, though, you
   won’t need to do any external processing of these images.

   We know a great one you should try, by the way! 😉

Don’t forget legal bits in your email newsletter

   If you conduct email marketing activities, you must adhere to certain
   legal guidelines. This means that your newsletter must contain an
   unsubscribe link.
   Mailjet’s unsubscribe link

   As we have already explained, it’s also a legal requirement that the
   recipient has given consent to receiving the newsletter. So stay away
   from sending unsolicited marketing emails as these are legally regarded
   as spamming. The practice of double opt-in, mentioned above, avoids
   legal disputes, warnings, and expensive financial penalties.

   Both also provide a threat if you use a newsletter software that is not
   compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


Email newsletter campaigns: Optimization

   With your content ready to go, it’s time to start sending your
   newsletters. As we mentioned before, the easiest way to go is by using
   an email service that lets you integrate your contact list, create your
   newsletter layout, and send your emails in one platform – like for
   example Mailjet. 😉

   Make sure to choose a service that offers tools for tracking and
   analyzing the newsletters you send, since it’s important to see how
   your audience responds to the emails you’re sending them. Most
   newsletter services offer tracking of delivery, opens, clicks, and
   unsubscribes, which are the essential figures in measuring your
   efforts.

   Here are the main metrics explained:
     * Open rate: The percentage of subscribers who have opened the
       newsletter.
     * Click rate: The percentage of recipients who have clicked on at
       least one link or call-to-action.
     * Conversions and/or revenue per click: The percentage of readers who
       have executed the desired action after left clicking on the target
       page (purchase, download, read complete blog article, etc.).
     * Unsubscribe rate: The percentage of users that have cancelled their
       newsletter subscription.


   Newsletter Stat Overview

   Once you’ve sent your first few newsletters, the opens and clicks
   should give you an initial idea about how your audience is reacting to
   your emails. This data is a great source for deciding how to optimize
   your future newsletters, since it tells you which elements of your
   newsletter can be tweaked.

   Make sure you know how to read email stats properly and how to identify
   what needs to be improved. If your open-rate is low, perhaps your
   subject line isn’t clear enough. If only few people click on the links
   in your newsletter, try to make your call-to-action (CTA) stand out
   more. If a lot of users are unsubscribing, take another look at your
   contact list or try grouping your contact list into more specific
   segments to get a more narrowing targeting.
   email stats

   Use this data to determine the exact performance of your newsletter and
   make any adjustments to individual elements. We recommend always
   implementing these adjustments using A/B testing.

   Tracking results and optimizing your newsletters should be an ongoing
   process that you keep doing to continually improve your results. Even
   when you reach positive results, try aiming even higher and find things
   that can be improved even further. For example, try experimenting with
   different fonts, colors, or number of images.


Best time to send a newsletter campaign

   The time at which your newsletter is sent is a crucial factor for
   success. Think about the best potential time for your email to be sent
   out. A well-designed newsletter with interesting content will have
   little chance of success if sent at the wrong time. It’s important that
   it reaches the recipient when they are most likely to be sitting in
   front of their computer.

   If you are new to newsletter marketing and lack the experience of
   having your own audience, try different times. Testing and comparing
   the results of newsletters sent at different times is the best way to
   know what works for your business.

   In most cases, there are some basic rules that you can follow for best
   results. If you work in the B2B sector, you should send your newsletter
   during regular working hours. Peak times are usually between 10 and 11
   AM, and between 3 and 4 PM. If your business model is B2C, then you
   should send during the week between 6 and 9 PM, and on weekends.

   Of course, there are many different tools that can be helpful. Use a
   web analysis software like Google Analytics and analyze the exact time
   when customers visit your website. Send your newsletter at the same
   time or shortly before, as potential recipients are engaged with your
   topic and/or they are on their computer at that time.

How to run successful email newsletter campaign on mobile?

   In an increasingly mobile world, people are relying more and more on
   this third screen to access their inbox and send email. While the
   overall look and feel of email hasn’t evolved much over the years, the
   way users access and read their email has certainly changed. Not too
   long ago, our inboxes were only accessible via dial-up modem from a
   stationary computer, whereas users today receive and read emails from
   their smart devices on the fly.

   This change in how and where users read their emails presents marketers
   with different challenges in how their newsletters are crafted and
   designed to make sure that messages get across to the desired audience.
   And it’s not just a matter of adapting your layout to the large number
   of different screen sizes.

   Your content and entire funnel must be optimized for mobile devices as
   well, in order to get the most out of your mobile audience. Studies
   have found that 65% of emails are opened first on mobile devices and
   three out of four users are “highly likely“ to delete an email if it
   isn’t optimized for viewing on a mobile device. In other words, if you
   haven’t already optimized your newsletters to mobile devices, now is a
   good time to do it.
   Mailjet Responsive Responsive email with Mailjet’s newsletter solution

   To get you started, we have gathered a few of the most important steps
   to take in optimizing your campaign for a mobile audience:

Your newsletter subject line is key

   The first thing users see when a new email pops into their inbox is the
   subject line. Even before opening the email, a user might choose to
   delete it based on the subject line alone. As such, it is crucial to
   create headlines that catches the attention of your audience and
   appeals to them.

   While this applies to every kind of email you send, it is even more
   important when addressing mobile users. Reading emails off a physically
   smaller screen gives you less space for your headline. Additionally,
   readers will be spending less time on each subject line since they will
   be scanning their inbox on the go.

   Tip: Keep your subject line short and precise. Use words that appeal to
   your readers and encourages them to open the email.

Newsletter Template: Kee your email layout simple

   Once a user has opened your email, you want to make sure that the
   content of your newsletter is optimized for a variety of screen sizes.
   The reason for this is quite evident: your message needs to get across
   to your readers, even on mobile screens.

   A solution for this is to keep your layout clear and simple. Stick with
   one column so your emails don’t get too wide for mobile devices. Divide
   your text into smaller sections and make it easy for readers to get an
   overview of the contents of the email.

   This also applies to your call-to-action (CTA) elements, such as
   buttons and links, that you want readers to click on. Make sure that
   these are easily clickable and placed intuitively in the email, to
   increase the chance of users following them.

   Finally, avoid using images that are too large, as they can slow down
   the loading time of the email for users that are making use of their
   mobile data to fetch your newsletter.

   Tip: Go for a simple layout to make it easy for your recipients to read
   your email. Make sure your CTA (call-to-action) is easy to find and
   click on.

   Check out the simple layout on this great Starbucks email.

Email Newsletter for mobile: Don’t forget your links

   Now that you have made sure to make your CTA easy to find, it’s time to
   look at your outgoing links. One thing is getting readers to click on
   your links, another thing is making sure the page they land on works on
   their mobile device as well.

   Ideally, the landing pages of your outgoing links are already mobile
   friendly, so the landing page automatically adapts its layout to match
   the device of the visitor. If you’re not using mobile landing pages,
   make sure you’re using code that can be displayed on all types of
   devices such as HTML5 as opposed to Flash.

   Tip: Optimize all outgoing links for mobile to get the most out of
   clicks-through.

Email Newsletter on mobile: Bring out your devices

   After you have the fundamentals of your layout down, it’s important to
   test the execution. This is especially important when you’re looking to
   optimize for mobile devices that come in many different sizes and
   screen resolutions. To gain an understanding of how your design works
   it’s a great idea to actually view your newsletter on several
   platforms.

   By doing so, you’ll quickly see how your layout elements are displayed
   on the different screens and how clear your call-to-action is shown in
   the email body. Again, these are important to the performance and
   overall success of your newsletter campaign.

   Tip: Test and preview your layout on a variety of devices and
   platforms.

Email newsletter templates examples

   Want to see some of these tips in action? We have selected four of our
   favorite newsletter examples for you to get inspiration and learn the
   basics.

   Check them out below!

Product Hunt

   What’s great about Product Hunt is how they use their brand identity to
   their benefit, using their signature red to make their CTA stand out on
   the white background.

   Product Hunt features one key element, which is placed first, and add
   some more in-depth value for those avid readers that are always keen to
   scroll down. Their text-image ratio is also on point, using their
   visual elements that are perfectly aligned with the brand identity.

Netflix

   Ah, yeah, have we mentioned we love Netflix already? Netflix uses
   personalized content to make sure their readers keep coming back to
   their newsletter and find true value in it.

   Also, check out their clever use of CTAs! Not everyone will be ready to
   indulge when Netflix’s email arrives, so by adding a combination of
   ‘Play’ and ‘My list’, they maximize their click rates and potential
   conversion.
   Netflix email newsletter example

Skyscanner

   When one signs up to the Skyscanner newsletter, they know what they’re
   looking for. Wanderlust-provoking articles with travel tips and
   suggestions that will help us daydream about being somewhere that’s not
   the office… And, oh man, do they deliver.

   There’s no question about the value added that their content offers,
   which makes their newsletter a great way to nurture contacts until they
   are ready to convert. And when they are, they’ll find personalized
   deals to inspire them and encourage them to click-through.
   Skyscanner email newsletter example

Fitbit

   At Fitbit, they have a clear goal in mind with their newsletter: to
   drive traffic to their blog, which is meant to inspire readers to
   become more active and make the most of their device. So they highlight
   their content value at the top (‘Top articles picked for you’) and
   smartly present their articles in a responsive design that is easy to
   read (and click!) on mobile.
