   questions or complaints and not to request data removal or data
   takeout, as these are specifically made self-service for easier and
   faster processing. Emailing instead will delay the process of handling
   your data removal or data takeout request and will make the process a
   lot harder and slower for those involved.

Samsung device specifications

   Are you looking for the technical specifications of a particular
   Samsung Galaxy device version? How much RAM did the US version of the
   Galaxy S4 have? Which antenna bands does the Korean Galaxy Note 8
   support? The answer to such questions can be found in SamMobile's
   device archive, one the web's largest databases of Samsung device
   specifications.

How to search

   You can search our database by device name or by model number. No
   matter how you search, you will need to know the model number of the
   device you are looking for, as different device versions are identified
   by that number. Of course, you can also you our extensive set of
   filters, to search devices by any of their most important features. For
   example, you can quickly find all Samsung devices running the Tizen
   operating system or show only tablets by selecting that model type.

Compare Samsung specifications

   Once you have made your device selection you can click on
   'specifications' to show all details of that particular device.
   However, you can also search and select another device, and hit
   'compare these devices' for a side-by-side view of all features. Note:
   we usually list the version of a device's operating system at the time
   of release. Usually, device will receive one or several OS updates
   during its support period. Current OS version might therefore be
   different from the version listed in our database.

Comments

   When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in
   the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user
   agent string to help spam detection.

   An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a
   hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using
   it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
   https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your
   profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your
   comment.

Media

   If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images
   with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the
   website can download and extract any location data from images on the
   website.

Contact forms

   Our contact forms are strictly used to submit support email messages to
   our back-end systems or to temporarily hold the details we need in case
   of promotions we run.

Cookies

   If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name,
   email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so
   that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave
   another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

   If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a
   temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This
   cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your
   browser.

   When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login
   information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two
   days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select
   “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of
   your account, the login cookies will be removed.

   If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved
   in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply
   indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after
   1 day.

Embedded content from other websites

   Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos,
   images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves
   in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

   These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
   additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that
   embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded
   content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

Analytics

   We use third-party web analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on
   our Services. These service providers may use cookies to help us
   analyze where in the world you are coming from and how you use the
   Services provided by us. To prevent Google Analytics from using your
   information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out
   Browser Add-on by clicking here. The Google Analytics service privacy
   policy is available here: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Advertisements

   We use both our own advertisements to promote our own services, deals
   or promotions, as well as third-party web advertisement services (such
   as Google AdSense). The Google Adsense service privacy policy is
   available here: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Performance, Security and Geo-location

   We use Cloudflare as our content delivery network (CDN), GeoIP provider
   (IP Geo-location lookup) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   mitigation solution.
   The Cloudflare service privacy policy is available here:
   https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/

Who we share your data with

   We do not disclose your personal data to third parties. If any data
   processor would ever need to process our personal data, we will post
   those changes on this page.
   Upon registering for our website, you can explicitly opt-in to Receive
   (Promotional) Emails from the SamMobile Team. You can always opt-out of
   these Promotional emails at any time.

How long we retain your data

   If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
   indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
   comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

   For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
   personal data they provide in their user profile. All users can see,
   edit, or delete their personal data at any time (except they cannot
   change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit
   that data.

What rights you have over your data

   If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can
   request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
   you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
   that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
   include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or
   security purposes.

   For data removal (deletions), use our self-service removal page. In
   case of errors, contact: [email protected]
   For data takeout (exports), use our self-service export page. In case
   of errors, contact: [email protected]

   For all other contact details, you can use one of our preferred contact
   methods.

Where we send your data

   Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection
   service (Akismet). The Akismet service privacy policy is available
   here: https://automattic.com/privacy/

Additional information

   If there are any questions or complaints regarding this Privacy &
   Cookies Policy you may contact us directly at [email protected] or
   through one of our preferred contact methods. Please, only use this for
   questions or complaints and not to request data removal or data
   takeout, as these are specifically made self-service for easier and
   faster processing. Emailing instead will delay the process of handling
   your data removal or data takeout request and will make the process a
   lot harder and slower for those involved.

   Samsung Galaxy device version? How much RAM did the US version of the
   Galaxy S4 have? Which antenna bands does the Korean Galaxy Note 8
   support? The answer to such questions can be found in SamMobile's
   device archive, one the web's largest databases of Samsung device
   specifications.

How to search

   You can search our database by device name or by model number. No
   matter how you search, you will need to know the model number of the
   device you are looking for, as different device versions are identified
   by that number. Of course, you can also you our extensive set of
   filters, to search devices by any of their most important features. For
   example, you can quickly find all Samsung devices running the Tizen
   operating system or show only tablets by selecting that model type.

Compare Samsung specifications

   Once you have made your device selection you can click on
   'specifications' to show all details of that particular device.
   However, you can also search and select another device, and hit
   'compare these devices' for a side-by-side view of all features. Note:
   we usually list the version of a device's operating system at the time
   of release. Usually, device will receive one or several OS updates
   during its support period. Current OS version might therefore be
   different from the version listed in our database.

Samsung device specifications

   Are you looking for the technical specifications of a particular
   Samsung Galaxy device version? How much RAM did the US version of the
   Galaxy S4 have? Which antenna bands does the Korean Galaxy Note 8
   support? The answer to such questions can be found in SamMobile's
   device archive, one the web's largest databases of Samsung device
   specifications.

How to search

   You can search our database by device name or by model number. No
   matter how you search, you will need to know the model number of the
   device you are looking for, as different device versions are identified
   by that number. Of course, you can also you our extensive set of
   filters, to search devices by any of their most important features. For
   example, you can quickly find all Samsung devices running the Tizen
   operating system or show only tablets by selecting that model type.

Compare Samsung specifications

   Once you have made your device selection you can click on
   'specifications' to show all details of that particular device.
   However, you can also search and select another device, and hit
   'compare these devices' for a side-by-side view of all features. Note:
   we usually list the version of a device's operating system at the time
   of release. Usually, device will receive one or several OS updates
   during its support period. Current OS version might therefore be
   different from the version listed in our database.

What is my model number?

   (BUTTON) ×

   For most devices, the model number (e.g. "GT-I9505" or "SM-G900F") is
   found inside the device. It becomes visible when you open your device
   and remove the battery.

   As an alternative, you can also type your model name (e.g. "GALAXY S5")
   instead of the number. But it may be a bit more difficult to find your
   specific device that way.

   Still not sure? Then perhaps Samsung can help you out with their
   model number lookup tool.
   (BUTTON) OK, I got it!
