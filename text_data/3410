   Vidjil is an open-source platform for the analysis of high-throughput
   sequencing data from lymphocytes, developed by the Bonsai
   bioinformatics lab and the VidjilNet consortium.

   V(D)J recombinations in lymphocytes are essential for immunological
   diversity. They are also useful markers of pathologies, and in
   leukemia, are used to quantify the minimal residual disease during
   patient follow-up. High-throughput sequencing (NGS/HTS) now enables the
   deep sequencing of a lymphoid population with dedicated Rep-Seq methods
   and software.

   Vidjil is used in routine clinical practice in hospitals around the
   world, in particular for the diagnosis of patients suffering Acute
   Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). More than 2,500 samples of ALL patients
   were analyzed with Vidjil since 2015. Vidjil is also used in several
   studies on other hemopathies (ALL, CLL, WM, lymphomas) as well as on
   immunology topics involving T-cell or B-cell repertoires.

     __________________________________________________________________

   The Vidjil algorithm processes sequences recombined on the TRA/D, TRB,
   TRG, IGH, IGK and IGL locus, possibly with some incomplete/unusal
   recombinations such as Dh-Jh, Intron-KDE or Dd2-Dd3.

High-throughput algorithm

   At the heart of the Vidjil platform, Vidjil-algo processes
   high-througput sequencing data to extract V(D)J junctions and gather
   them into clones. Vidjil-algo starts from a set of reads and detects
   “windows” overlapping the actual CDR3. It detects gene rearrangements
   from both immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors, as well as some
   incomplete or uncommon rearrangements. The analysis is based on a
   reliable seed-based algorithm. It is extremely fast because, in the
   first phase, no alignment is performed with database germline
   sequences. The algorithm works on reads coming from either
   amplicon-based or capture-based deep sequencing strategy, as soon as
   they include CDR3 sequences. Both human and mouse immune systems can be
   analyzed.

Multi-sample web application

   The Vijdil web application is made for the visualization, inspection
   and analysis of clones and their tracking along the time in a MRD setup
   or in a immunological study. The application can visualize data
   processed by the Vidjil algorithm or by other V(D)J analysis pipelines.
   It enables to explore further clusterings proposed by the software
   and/or done manually done by the user.

   The patient view of the Vidjil web application. The database enables to
   store information on both the patient and individual samples.

Patient/experiment and sample database

   The web application can be linked to a patient/experiment and sample
   database. After authentication, the clinicians or researchers upload
   .fasta/.fastq/.gz files, manage and process their runs directly from
   the web application. They can save their analysis and generate reports
   for the patient record. The server with the sample database can be
   installed in any hospital or computer center. A public web server is
   also available since October 2014. More than 20 labs in Europe and in
   the world regularly use Vidjil through the web application. In 18
   months, the public server analyzed more than 5,000,000 sequences from
   5,000 RepSeq samples.
