WELCOME TO IEEE PIMRC’18

   Posted on 16 October 2017, updated on 13 February 2018 by Matthew
   Sielski

   The 29th Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and
   Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE PIMRC 2018) welcomes original
   research and developments in all areas of wireless technology, from the
   radio channel and PHY layer, to MAC and network issues, business and
   applications of radio communications.

   The symposium will be held on September 9-12, 2018 in Bologna, Italy,
   at Polo Congressuale, a large congress centre located close to the city
   centre. Information on the venue can be found here. The event will
   comprise world-class keynotes, panels, workshops and tutorials,
   technical and business sessions: the preliminary program structure can
   be found here; it also includes a welcome reception on Sunday
   afternoon, and a banquet on Tuesday night, held in the magnificent
   framework of a 800-year old palace located in the main square of the
   city.

   The theme of this edition is “Towards a Connected World of People and
   Things”; the impact of radio technologies on many important aspects of
   people’s life, and the role of the Internet of Things in the automotive
   and agro-food sectors, on smart manufacturing, arts and other
   application areas, will be discussed by the keynote speakers, within
   the panels and workshops included in the program. The evolution on 5G
   standardization and its early experimentation, will be among the key
   topics addressed by the event.

   Bologna is in the hearth of Europe: a city with around 380,000
   inhabitants and a University hosting about 100,000 students,
   representing a compulsory point of passage between the North and South
   of Italy; from here historical Italian cities like Venice, Florence,
   Milan and Rome can be conveniently reached by high speed train in one
   or two hours; please read here suggestions about one-day journeys to
   these beautiful cities, or a dive into the medieval center of Bologna.
   Information on the city and on the tourist opportunities offered to the
   attendees can be found here.

   The University of Bologna was founded in 1088, and it is considered the
   most ancient in the western world. According to International and
   National agencies, it is the best University in Italy, and a recent
   ranking published by Times Higher Education has nominated it as the
   “most beautiful” in the world. Its history and current level of
   internationalization makes it an indispensable point of reference in
   the panorama of European culture and science.

   Radio Communication is a discipline with profound roots in Bologna;
   Guglielmo Marconi performed here the first wireless communication
   experiments in 1895. Come and visit his Villa, where wireless
   technology was born. Today, the Department “Guglielmo Marconi”
   (recently nominated by the Italian Ministry of University and Research
   as “Department of Excellence”) plays a relevant role in research on
   radio communications at international level.

   Bologna is “an old lady, with tender hips, the breast on the Po Valley,
   and the bottom on the hills” according to one of its most famous
   songwriters and singers (Francesco Guccini). It is a historical city,
   with one of the most beautiful medieval centres in Italy and about 50
   Km of porticos where you can walk, protected from rain, or sun.
   September is definitely the best period of the year to visit Bologna:
   warm, not too hot.

   If you are not convinced yet, please read ten reasons to attend
   PIMRC2018.

   Looking forward to meeting you in Bologna, on Sept. 9-12, 2018, at
   PIMRC!

   Roberto Verdone

KEYNOTES

PLENARY KEYNOTE SPEECH BY MISCHA DOHLER ON “THE MAKING OF 5G – TOWARDS THE
INTERNET OF SKILLS & SYNCHRONIZED REALITY”

ABSTRACT

   We were privileged to be part of a £16m UK project on 5G. In this
   keynote, I will share the fascinating story on how we managed to be the
   first in the world to build and deploy an end-to-end 5G system. I will
   share the hard lessons learned but also the incredible transformative
   capabilities of 5G, both in our ecosystem as well as from a user point
   of view. An important constituent is the ability to deliver low-latency
   services which I believe will transform Virtual Reality to the novel
   concept of Synchronized Reality. I will explain the technical
   embodiments and how it underpins the next-generation Internet, the
   Internet of Skills. Finally, there will be a surprise live intervention
   from my end — stay “tuned”!

PLENARY KEYNOTE SPEECH BY DAVID GESBERT ON “LEARNING FROM THE SKY: AUTONOMOUS
FLYING ACCESS NETWORKS FOR BEYOND 5G”

ABSTRACT

   The use of flying robots (drones) carrying radio transceiver equipment
   is the new promising frontier in our quest towards ever more flexible,
   adaptable and spectrally efficient wireless networks. Beyond obvious
   challenges within regulatory, control, navigation, and operational
   domains, the deployment of autonomous flying radio access network
   (Fly-RANs) also comes with a number of exciting new research problems
   such as the issue of autonomous real-time placement of the drones in a
   way that can guarantee user and network performance. We present several
   different scenarios of interest such as IoT monitoring and mobile
   broadband access. The approaches lie at the cross-roads between machine
   learning, signal processing and optimization. Some approaches exploit
   the reconstruction of 3D map from sampled radio measurements which can
   have application beyond the realm of communications. Early-stage
   practical realizations are demonstrated.

PLENARY KEYNOTE SPEECH BY TOMMASO MELODIA ON “TOWARD AN INTERNET OF
INTRA-BODY THINGS”

ABSTRACT

   Wireless networks of electronically controlled implantable medical
   sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative and
   potentially revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing
   this vision of networked implants is posed by the dielectric nature of
   the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency
   electromagnetic waves used in traditional wireless technologies.

   This talk will give an overview of ongoing research at Northeastern
   University exploring a radically different approach, i.e., establishing
   wireless networked systems in human tissues that transfer data and
   energy through acoustic waves at ultrasonic frequencies. We will start
   off by discussing applications of networked implantable medical
   systems. We will then analyze fundamental aspects of ultrasonic
   propagation in human tissues and their impact on the design of wireless
   networking protocols at different layers of the protocol stack. We will
   then discuss our work on designing and prototyping the first ultrasonic
   Internet-of-Things platform through a closed-loop combination of
   mathematical modeling, simulation, and experimental evaluation.

PLENARY KEYNOTE SPEECH BY ALEX GLUHAK ON “THE JOURNEY OF LPWAN THROUGH THE
VALLEY OF DISILLUSIONMENT”

ABSTRACT

   It has been nearly one decade since low power wide area networks
   (LPWAN) have emerged, with the ambition to provide the communication
   technology of choice for many IoT applications. The initial hype around
   LPWAN has generated a variety of proprietary and standard based
   technologies, vying for market adoption. The fierce rivalry is often
   battled out by the marketing machineries of their backers as technical
   features do not yet seem to play key differentiators. During this talk
   we will reflect upon the current LPWAN technology landscape and the
   journey many of the technologies have since taken. It will examine
   existing differences in technology ecosystems and the business models
   they enable. Focusing on the main contenders, key deployments of
   networks and use cases across the world will be discussed highlighting
   hot and upcoming industry trends that can make a difference to LPWAN in
   future.
