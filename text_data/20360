Introduction

   This animated introduction to The Generations & Gender Programme
   explains the purpose, function and value of a social science research
   infrastructure to the domains of public policy and research.

Background

   The Generations & Gender Programme Research Infrastructure provides
   scientists and policy makers with high quality and timely data about
   families and life course trajectories of individuals to enable
   researchers to contribute insights and answers to current societal and
   public policy challenges.

   The GGP provides users with an open-access data source of
   cross-nationally comparative surveys and contextual data.

   Started under the umbrella of the United Nations Economic Commission
   for Europe (UNECE), the GGP infrastructure is run by institutes with
   strong traditions in academic research on population and family change
   and on survey methodology. The UNECE coordinated the GGP until 2009 and
   continues to provide critical services to the infrastructure.

   The GGP survey focuses on inter-generational and gender relations
   between people, expressed in care arrangements and the organization of
   paid and unpaid work. These features significantly improve the
   knowledge base for social science and policy-making in Europe and other
   developed countries. Crucial to understanding behaviours across the
   life course is the longitudinal panel design of the GGP surveys. The
   contextual database provides information on variations in context over
   time through more than 100 indicators from 60 countries in multiple
   regions as these are believed to have an impact on relationships
   between genders and generations.

   In an increasingly globalized world, Europe faces major social,
   economic, cultural and technological challenges. In Europe 2020, the
   European Union develops a strategy ‚Äúto help us come out stronger from
   the crisis and turn the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive
   economy delivering high levels of employment, productivity and social
   cohesion‚Äù. To realize the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth that
   the EU envisages, the human capital of Europe‚Äôs populations is the
   continent‚Äôs largest asset.

   To capitalize on that asset calls for a constant reappraisal of how
   Europeans arrange their lives, both as individuals, as family units and
   as countries. The economic crisis affects not only day-to-day
   decisions, but also fundamental choices at all stages of people‚Äôs
   lives: marriage and childbearing, the combination of employment and
   caring responsibilities for the young and the old, retirement, housing,
   and ageing well. How Europeans cope with these fundamental choices has
   important consequences for their personal well-being as well as for the
   adaptability and competitiveness of the societies in which they live.
   Given the extent and urgency of the challenges facing Europe‚Äôs
   populations, policy makers and the general public require scientific
   information on how to effectively deal with them. In order for the
   social sciences to respond to current policy challenges with
   appropriate and sustainable responses, high-quality data are essential.

   The first GGP panel waves were conducted in 2004. To date, at least one
   wave of the Generations & Gender Survey has been conducted in 20
   European and 4 non-European countries. The GGP is unique in its large
   coverage of Central and East European countries, and is also the only
   comparative longitudinal panel study that covers the entire adult age
   range. A new round of data collection is planned for 2020.

History

   The Generations and Gender Programme (GGP) was launched in 2000 by the
   Population Unit of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
   (UNECE) and has been coordinated by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary
   Demographic Institute since 2009. It is a social science Research
   Infrastructure that provides harmonized, large-scale, longitudinal,
   cross-national panel data on individual life courses and family
   dynamics. Over time, the GGP follows respondents through relationships,
   marriages, parenthood, divorces, deaths and many of the opportunities
   and challenges that people face along the way. It then tracks the
   causes and consequences of these events at the individual and societal
   levels.  The contextual database complements the survey data with
   regional and national level indicators to help increase our
   understanding of the role policy and other contextual factors play in
   individuals‚Äô and families‚Äô lives. These open access data resources,
   curated by the GGP, are ideally suited to formulate
   scientifically-informed and policy-relevant answers to key societal
   questions.

   The GGP is as a successor to the Fertility and Family Survey (FFS)
   which was conducted in the 1990s. The FFS was a cross-nationally
   comparative survey programme conducted by the Population Unit of
   the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The survey was
   carried on in 24 countries during the 1990s. The FFS micro-level data
   is compatible and comparable with the GGP datasets enabling analysis of
   longer periods of time and different populations.

   From its inception, the GGP has strongly relied upon the commitment of
   the participating institutions to achieve its large-scale ambition. The
   GGP as it exists today is possible due to the efforts of its Consortium
   comprised of renowned representatives of international institutes with
   strong traditions in academic research on population, family change and
   survey methodology. At the national level, participating institutions
   have invested major fundraising efforts to implement the national
   micro- and macro-level data collections, with most funds being provided
   either by national governments, by statistical offices and/or by
   national science foundations. Some participating institutions have
   invested considerable funds in data collection from their own
   resources. At the international level, the coordination and development
   of the GGP relies heavily on Consortium Board institutions.

   Some of the GGP‚Äôs key milestones include:
     * In 2000, UNECE launched the Programme at the international meeting
       Generations & Gender: Research into their behavior and quality of
       life in Geneva, where experts from population research institutes
       and statistical offices defined the aims, organization and general
       principles of the methodology of the Programme.
     * In 2007, a two-year grant from EU-DG Employment entitled
       Generations & Gender Programme: Policy-Relevant Insights into
       Causes and Consequences of Demographic Change (Agreement No
       30-CE-0121820/00-30), provided support for the then programme
       coordinator UNECE and allowed for an acceleration of the
       programme‚Äôs development.
     * In 2008, results of the first Generations and Gender Surveys were
       reviewed and discussed at the UNECE conference How Generations and
       Gender Shape Demographic Change in Geneva. The Conference
       demonstrated internationally the first findings and rich potential
       of the Programme and discussed the expectations of policymakers
       from across Europe and North America.
     * In 2009, a subsequent EU-DG Research grant entitled ‚ÄòDesign Studies
       for Research Infrastructures‚Äô funded under the 7^th Framework
       Programme (FP7) which ran from 2009-2012 signified a further major
       change in the tempo of development, enabling a strategic rethink of
       the Programme‚Äôs long-term strategy. The Design Study was used to
       critically assess and update the GGP‚Äôs programme of work including
       both the methodological components inherent to large-scale
       cross-national studies and to prepare the Blueprint for GGP‚Äôs
       future as an autonomous, sustainable international research
       infrastructure.

     * In 2016, the GGP obtained the status of Emerging Project by the
       European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). The
       ESFRI committee noted the GGP‚Äôs scientific excellence as well as
       its European added value and socio-economic impact.
     * In 2016, the GGP received funding for the Horizon 2020-funded
       Generations & Gender Programme: Evaluate, Plan and Initiate (GGP
       EPI) to further pursue the programme‚Äôs aim to continue to expand
       its potential for scientific advancement, innovation and societal
       impact (2016-2019) (Grant Agreement No 739511).  The GGP EPI
       project provides the GGP with the means to institutionalize and
       further formalize key processes required to position GGP for a
       successful application for inclusion in the ESFRI Roadmap 2020 as a
       sustainable, world-class research infrastructure accessible to all
       researchers in Europe and beyond.

   The GGP‚Äôs unique data resources continue to strengthen the knowledge
   base for social science and public policymaking in Europe and developed
   countries elsewhere.

GGP 2020

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjktgdD9yUU?feature=oembed

   The Generations and Gender Programme (GGP) is pleased to announce that
   it will be carrying out a new round of data collection in 2020. The aim
   of the GGP is to deliver high quality data for scientific research on
   population dynamics and family change, relationships between
   generations, and changes in the social roles of women and men,
   accounting for economic, social and cultural contexts. The GGP is a
   world leader on issues of fertility decisions, work-life balance,
   transition to adulthood, and intergenerational exchanges. So far, more
   than twenty countries have participated in our programme.

   The new round of data collection promises to bring fresh insights on
   low fertility, the complex life trajectories of young adults, and the
   dynamics of families. To do so it will use a common, centrally
   administered questionnaire, the latest survey technologies, and will
   offer the possibility of multi-mode of data collection.

   Countries interested in participating are asked to contact the GGP
   Coordination Team as soon as possible. The GGP provides extensive
   support to national teams on all steps of the data life cycle including
   translation, sampling, fieldwork, harmonization and documentation.
   Importantly, the GGP operates under an open data access principle
   allowing registered users worldwide access to the harmonized data.

Projects

   There are a number of surveys with which the Generations and Gender
   Survey collaborates its efforts to understand family and relationship
   dynamics across the lifecourse:

   The Social Science & Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) is a four year
   project financed by the European Commission under Horizon 2020. SSHOC
   will realize the social sciences and humanities part of the European
   Open Science Cloud by offering flexible access to research data and
   related services adapted to the needs of the SSH community

   Synergies for Europe‚Äôs Research Infrastructures in the Social Sciences
   (SERISS) is a four-year project that aims to strengthen and harmonise
   social science research across Europe. GGP is a partner within the
   project alongside other major comparative sociological surveys in
   Europe such as the Survey for Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe
   (SHARE), the European Social Survey (ESS), The Consortium of European
   Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) and the European Value Survey
   (EVS)

   Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) were conducted in the 1990s in 23
   member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
   (UNECE). The project concluded in 2000 with the FFS Flagship
   Conference. The micro-data of the surveys is available for research.
   The FFS is the the immediate predeccesor the Generations and Gender
   Programme.

   The German Family Panel pairfam (‚ÄúPanel Analysis of Intimate
   Relationships and Family Dynamics‚Äù) is a multi-disciplinary,
   longitudinal study for researching partnership and family dynamics in
   Germany. The annually collected survey data from a nationwide random
   sample of more than 12,000 persons of the three birth cohorts 1971-73,
   1981-83, 1991-93 and their partners, parents and children offers unique
   opportunities for the analysis of partner and generational
   relationships as they develop over the course of multiple life phases.
   A working paper detailing the relationship between the GGP and Parifam
   can be found here.

   The Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) is a large-scale database on
   Dutch families. The research questions revolve around the theme of
   solidarity, which is defined as ‚Äòfeelings of mutual affinity in family
   relationships and how these are expressed in behavioural terms‚Äô. Four
   waves of an extensive face-to-face interview have been conducted (Wave
   1 in 2002 ‚Äì 2004, Wave 2 in 2006 ‚Äì 2007, Wave 3 in 2010 ‚Äì 2011, Wave 4
   in 2014).

   ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic
   Innovations) works to develop a sustainable research infrastructure for
   the social sciences in the Netherlands. Through ODISSEI, researchers
   within the social sciences will have access to interconnected
   large-scale, longitudinal data collections. This virtual web will
   enable researchers to answer new, cross-disciplinary research questions
   and to investigate existing questions in new ways.

   The PROGEDO large infrastructure ensures the implementation of a public
   policy for social sciences and humanities for France. It focuses
   especially on research on law, economics, geography, management,
   history, political sciences and sociology.  Its role is based on the
   missions defined since 2008 in the national roadmap for large research
   infrastructures produced by the French Ministry for Higher Education
   and Research. As part of the French Roadmap since 2016, GGP
   participates in the work of PROGEDO.


Design

   We ask people about their relationships, their families and their
   children and this data together provides hundred‚Äôs of thousands of life
   stories. Taken together these stories weave a patchwork in which we
   look for patterns and try to understand how these patterns are changing
   over time and what might be causing them. In this visualization you can
   watch the lives of 500 people unfold.  Each dot in the animation
   represents one real person that the GGP interviewed in the country you
   select from the drop down menu.

   At the Age of 15 pretty much everybody is single and doesn‚Äôt have any
   children so they start down in the bottom left hand corner. Then as
   time passes some find a partner to live with and some even get married.
   When they do, the little dot that represents them moves up to represent
   this change in their relationship status. As time passes some people
   also have children, and to represent this the dot moves to the right
   for every additional child they have.

   The dots in the visualization are two different colours to represent
   two groups of people. The green dots are people who were born in 1950.
   They would have been 17 during the ‚Äòsummer of love‚Äô and 35 years old
   during the ‚ÄòLive Aid‚Äô concert in 1985. They are commonly called ‚Äòbaby
   boomers‚Äô. The orange dots are people who were born in 1970. They were
   19 when the Berlin Wall fell and 30 at the turn of the Millennium. They
   are generally referred to as ‚ÄòGeneration X‚Äô. These two generations have
   lived quite different lives, as the visualization shows.

   Click ‚ÄòStart‚Äô to begin the animation. You can change the country by
   selecting another one from the drop down list, clicking ‚ÄòUpdate‚Äô and
   then clicking ‚ÄòStart‚Äô again.

Key Features

Cross-national comparability

   Up till now, 20 countries have conducted at least one wave of data
   collection. The comparative focus allows analyses of the ways in which
   policies, culture and economic circumstances influence dependencies
   between men and women and between the young and the old.

A longitudinal design

   The GGP survey applies a panel design ‚Äì collecting information on the
   same persons at three-year intervals ‚Äì to allow the examination of
   causes and consequences of inequalities between genders and
   generations. Twelve countries have thus far conducted at least two
   waves of the GGP survey.

A large sample size

   The GGP survey has an average of 10,000 respondents per country, making
   it possible to study numerical minorities and uncommon events.

A broad age range

   The GGP collects data on the whole life course by interviewing
   respondents aged 18-79. It also enables analysis of multiple
   generations by asking extensive questions about intergenerational
   exchange and support

The combination of micro and macro data

   Alongside the micro data collected via surveys, the GGP has a
   contextual database with over 100 indicators which cover not only the
   year of the survey but also retrospective indicators covering the past
   40 years to be used alongside the retrospective data in the surveys.

A theory-driven and multidisciplinary questionnaire

   The GGS questionnaire is developed and maintained by a team of leading
   social scientists from demography, sociology and economics. The
   questionnaire seeks to bring together a wide range of subjects that
   examine the causes and consequences of family change.
