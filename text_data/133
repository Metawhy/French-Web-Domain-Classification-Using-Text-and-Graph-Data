   I loved how busy Casablanca was! there's the beach, tram, souk, and the
   mall!

   This has to be one of the exotic cities/countries that we have ever
   been to. Loved the bazaars and just walking around the streets watching
   the locals transact business and communicate.

   Experience of a lifetime! What a magical experience! Ahmed & Ahmed from
   Begaa Tours made sure my first trip to Morocco was absolutely
   unforgettable. I will definitely be back. I traveled alone and felt
   safe, happy and welcomed everywhere I went, thanks to these wonderful
   guides. I visited Chefchaouen, Fes, Merzouga, Ouarzazate and Marrakech
   in 8 days - a quick but incredible trip which I would recommend to
   anyone!

   This is primarily a business destination, not so much a tourism
   destination, but it definitely is interesting, giving a serious taste
   of Moroccan city life. The traffic is wild and chaotic, but obviously
   has it's own flow if you know how to handle it. Hotels are often full
   at just about any time of year, so book early if you have a specific
   preference. During my stay, as we roamed the city streets, there was
   nary a tourist in sight, until we came to the coastal Corniche area,
   with it's clubs and cafes, near the Mosque Hassan II. Despite the
   apparent lack of western tourists, the locals clearly know what they
   are when the see them, so expect to be befriended and offered "help" by
   many. Of course, compensation is expected. Many goods are available at
   excellent prices compared to the west, but it's a good idea to scope
   out prices for things you might want to buy before shopping, maybe
   asking typical prices at your hotel. As a foodie, I had fun sampling
   the offerings from the many carts and stalls in the Old Medina - spicy
   escargot, egg sandwich, fried fish, sausage sandwich, traditional
   Harira soup, and more - but it's probably not for the
   'delicate-of-stomach" and faint-hearted. Also, definitely try the lamb
   in Morocco, Good to note that photography is somewhat foreign, and it's
   recommended to either ask permission before shooting, or to shoot
   under-cover. In some cases it's worth it to hand out a couple dirhams
   as a thank you. Getting a taxi can take a while, but if there's room,
   you might get one shared with you. Always make sure the driver turns on
   the meter, and don't let them quote you a price unless you already know
   it's a fair one. Buses aren't recommended transportation for
   non-locals, unless you have a local guiding you, like we did. By the
   end of 2012, the new tram system should be in service, hopefully
   alleviating some of the crazy traffic and packed buses. Although this
   isn't a typical tourist spot, there is plenty to see and do, from
   street culture to high end hammams.
