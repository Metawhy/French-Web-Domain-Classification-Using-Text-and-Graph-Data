Phonemic Chart

   This phonemic chart uses symbols from the International Phonetic
   Alphabet (IPA). IPA symbols are useful for learning pronunciation. The
   symbols on this chart represent the 44 sounds used in British English
   speech (Received Pronunciation or RP, an educated accent associated
   with but not exclusive to south-east England).

   Learners and teachers may want to print a copy of this phonemic chart
   to keep close at hand for reference.

   About EnglishClub
   FAQs, comments, reviews

   ESL or EFL? What do ESL and EFL mean? ESL stands for English as a
   Second Language. EFL stands for English as a Foreign Language. ESL is
   used when people learn English in an English speaking country. EFL is
   used when people learn English in a non-English speaking country. Is
   this important? Not very, if you are a learner. But there are some
   important technical considerations for teachers.
