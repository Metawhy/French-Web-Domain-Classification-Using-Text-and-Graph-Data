Sizmek Opt-Out

   For information on interest-based advertising, including to understand
   what opting-out means and your opt-out choices, please see the section
   headed “Opt-Out and Your Choices” below. To actually review your
   choices and set your control and opt-out options for your devices,
   including computer browsers and mobile browsers and devices, you must
   visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section here.

Privacy Practices for Our Sizmek Websites (www.sizmek.com)

   Sizmek Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Sizmek”, “we” and “us”) firmly
   believe in the importance of online privacy. We do not collect any
   information that enables us to determine your actual identity before,
   during or after your visit to this corporate website (sizmek.com) or
   our regional sites accessible from this website, other than your
   information that you voluntarily supply to us (e.g. by submitting
   information through the “Contact Us” form). When you provide your
   information directly to us, this information is used by Sizmek solely
   for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. More
   information about opting out of our use of cookies on our websites is
   available by clicking on the Cookie Consent link in the lower, left
   corner of the home page of our website.

Privacy Practices for Advertising and Content Served by Sizmek

   We respect your right to privacy throughout all of the services we
   provide. In particular, as a member of the Network Advertising
   Initiative (NAI), Sizmek adheres to the NAI Codes of Conduct as well as
   the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the
   European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (EDAA) regarding
   our use of data for interest-based advertising purposes. We also comply
   with the policies of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework,
   as a registered vendor on the Global Vendor List. For more information
   about these organizations, their policies and interest-based
   advertising, please visit their websites by clicking on the following
   links: NAI (here), DAA (here), EDAA (here), or the IAB Europe
   Transparency and Consent Framework (here).

Data Collection through Sizmek Services

What do Sizmek’s Services do?

   Through our services, our customers – advertisers, advertising
   agencies, publishers, and other users of Sizmek services – may collect
   and use information about your device to provide you with a more
   tailored online advertising experience. Our customers use Sizmek’s
   tools and services to create and deliver advertisements, to monitor the
   success of and manage advertising campaigns, to detect and minimize
   advertising fraud and, ultimately, to present you with advertisements
   that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you. Delivering
   relevant ads that are tailored to users’ interests is known as
   “interest based advertising” (sometimes also referred to as “behavioral
   advertising” or “targeted advertising”).

How does interest based advertising work?

   To perform interest based advertising, Sizmek’s cookies and similar
   technologies (described below) are deployed on your devices, and
   through the third-party websites and mobile applications you use, to
   collect information about your interests and behavior on the internet.
   The information we collect is associated with your cookie identifiers
   and/or mobile advertising identifiers (if you are using a mobile
   device), as well as your IP address. We never collect information about
   your actual identity.

   We use the information we collect for online ad tailoring purposes or
   to deliver an advertisement to you from a company whose website or
   mobile application you have visited or whose advertisement you have
   viewed in the past. As explained above, our technology employs cookies,
   device identifiers and similar technologies (like pixels and
   statistical device identifiers) to collect information about your
   browser or device, the sites it has visited and the apps it has used,
   the advertisements served to it, interactions with those
   advertisements, and, where available, the approximate geographic
   location of the device (“behavioral information”). This behavioral
   information is collected in the course of providing our customers with
   ad-serving and campaign management services and used for the purpose of
   helping our customers determine which advertisement is suitable to be
   delivered to you.

   This behavioral information, which does not enable Sizmek to determine
   your actual identity, may be shared with our customers and Sizmek’s and
   our customers’ partners for their lawful advertising purposes. In some
   areas of the world, certain behavioral information, such as IP
   addresses, cookie identifiers and device identifiers, may be considered
   to be personal information (sometimes referred to as personal data)
   that is protected under applicable laws. Where this is the case, we
   comply with applicable laws regarding our use and processing of
   personal information.

Cross-device interest based advertising

   We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile
   devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on
   your devices that interact with the internet. Sizmek engages in cross
   device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data
   from separate devices that have been determined through statistical
   analysis to be linked or related. Sizmek, or partners that we employ to
   provide this service, use cross device data to provide interest based
   advertising services to our customers and to deliver tailored ads to
   users across multiple devices.

Information Collected by Customers and their Partners

   Please note that Sizmek customers sometimes include their own (or their
   partners’) ad-tags, pixels or similar technologies within
   advertisements that Sizmek serves to websites, in order to set and read
   their own cookies which Sizmek does not control.

   In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses
   Sizmek services, or click through an ad to the website or online
   service of one of our customers, those customers may collect additional
   information about your visit beyond the information described in this
   privacy policy. They may also allow other companies (such as other ad
   networks or web analytics services) to collect information through
   mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and similar technologies.

   Sizmek is not responsible for and cannot control the data collection
   and use practices of its customers or their partners. You should read
   the privacy notices of the websites you visit and the online services
   and interactive ads that you use to understand what information
   companies collect and how they use that information.

Sharing of Behavioral Information with Customers

   We share the behavioral information collected from our advertising
   technologies with our customers and partners for their lawful
   advertising purposes. We may also share behavioral information with our
   customers’ service providers to enable them to provide services on our
   customers’ behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads
   for our customers. We use reasonable efforts to require our customers
   and partners to treat the behavioral information we share with them in
   accordance with applicable laws, the terms of the contracts we may have
   with them, and their own privacy policies, but cannot control their use
   of this information.

Information Sizmek Collects on Behalf of Third Parties

   On occasion, at the request and on behalf of a customer, Sizmek may
   collect personal information supplied voluntarily by consumers through
   their interaction with data collection fields in the body of
   advertisements or on websites (such as name, email, etc.). This
   personal information is provided directly to the customer on whose
   behalf the information was collected, or the customer’s service
   providers, and is processed by Sizmek only to the extent and as long as
   is necessary to provide the advertising services for which the personal
   information was collected. Our customers are limited by contract to use
   this personal information solely for the purposes identified within the
   advertisement to provide consumers with requested goods, services, or
   information as established within that customer’s privacy policy.
   Sizmek is not responsible for its customers’ use of this voluntarily
   supplied data. Sizmek does not distribute this personal information to
   any party other than those indicated within the advertisement or, at
   the customers’ direction, their service providers. Sizmek never
   associates any of this personal information with any other data (such
   as behavioral information) gathered or used in the delivery of
   advertisements.

Links to Other Sites

   Our site and the advertisements we serve on behalf of customers may
   contain links to other sites whose information practices may be
   different from ours. In addition, there may be links to other sites
   provided within the body of advertisements on other websites. We do not
   have control over the information that is submitted to, or collected
   by, these third parties. You should consult the privacy policy of these
   other sites to learn how your privacy is protected.

Interest Segments

   Sizmek, our customers, and our respective partners collect behavioral
   information to create interest segments. An interest segment is a set
   of profiles of users or their devices that are grouped according to
   user characteristics or interests, such as “Autos,” “Travel” or
   “Cooking.” Each profile is an anonymous or pseudonymous identifier that
   is tied to users’ devices. As a user’s device interacts with ads,
   websites and mobile applications, the characteristics and interests of
   the users of such devices can be collected and inferred. These
   characteristics and interests are represented by the identifier
   associated with your device, and then grouped with other, similar
   identifiers to create an interest segment. Sizmek, our customers and
   our respective partners use interest segments to deliver ads to your
   devices that are related to your interests. We require our partners to
   treat the information used to create these segments in accordance with
   applicable laws, the terms of our contracts with them, and their
   privacy policies. You can opt-out of interest based advertising based
   on interest segments at any time, as described under the heading
   “Opt-Out and Your Choices” below.

   We also receive interest segments and other pseudonymous information
   from third parties, when they choose to provide it to us and are
   lawfully permitted to do so. This information may include identifiers
   (like mobile advertising IDs) and interest-based advertising data tied
   to those identifiers, including segments provided by third-party data
   providers for our clients to use in delivering tailored ads through
   Sizmek’s services. Sizmek does not use this data to determine your
   actual identity.

   Sizmek does not knowingly create or use interest segments based on
   sensitive categories such as race, religion, sexual orientation or
   health; however, Sizmek, our customers and our respective partners may
   use interest segments related to health (which are not comprised of
   sensitive health data) to provide tailored ads that may be of interest
   to you.

Data Security and Retention

   We have appropriate technical and organizational security measures in
   place to help protect the personal information that is submitted to us
   voluntarily through our web site or collected through interactions with
   our services. However, no system can be completely secure, and we make
   no guarantees as to the safety or security of any information
   transmitted to or from this site or through our services. Sizmek
   retains information we receive from your device in log files that is
   stored for up to 13 months from the time it is stored, after which time
   the log files are deleted.

Our Use of Cookies and Similar Advertising Technologies

   This section provides additional information about the various
   technologies that Sizmek uses to deliver ads to you and services to our
   customers, including services that collect behavioral information when
   you interact with our customers’ ads or the sites and applications
   where their ads are provided. To learn how to control or opt-out of our
   use of these technologies, including to understand what opting-out
   means and your opt-out choices, please read the section, “Opt-Out &
   Your Choices” below. If you wish to exercise your control or opt-out
   options, visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section
   here.

Cookies

   We use cookies to provide functionality to our website and also to
   deliver our advertising services to our customers. A cookie is a small
   text file that can be stored on your computer or device when you view
   an advertisement or website relating to one of our customers. The
   cookie does not contain your name, address, phone number, email
   address, or anything that enables us to determine your actual identity.
   Instead, Sizmek uses cookies to collect behavioral information such as
   a computer’s IP address, the type of the computer’s operating system,
   the type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and
   at what time. Sizmek also uses cookies to collect demographic
   information collected through anonymous online surveys such as gender
   and age range, as well as information about your browsing activity for
   the purpose of delivering advertising based on preferences or interests
   known or inferred from the data collected. We also use cookies to
   determine if we have already served an ad to a specific user and to cap
   the frequency that they are presented to the same user.

   To learn more about the cookies we serve when you visit the Sizmek
   website (including how to opt-out of them), please visit our Cookie
   Consent link in the lower, left corner of our website.

Mobile Advertising Identifiers

   Most mobile devices include an identifier that allows application
   publishers and marketers to track user activity on mobile devices for
   advertising purposes (for example, Google’s Android Advertising
   Identifier (AAID) and Apple’s Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)).
   Sizmek, Sizmek’s customers and our respective partners may use mobile
   advertising identifiers for the same purposes for which we use cookies
   and statistical identifiers, including serving ads based on precise
   location data when you have consented to share. See the below section
   on precise location data to learn more about how and when Sizmek
   requires opt-in consent for the processing and use of precise location
   data.

Log files

   Like most websites and advertising services providers, we gather
   certain information about your use of the Sizmek website and services
   automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not
   allow us to determine your actual identity, to analyze trends, to
   administer the site and services, to track users’ movements around the
   Sizmek website and the devices to which we provide advertisements, and
   to gather demographic information about our users who interact with our
   services as a whole. We obfuscate IP addresses in any reporting
   information that is shared with or made available to our clients.

Pixels (also known as Clear Gifs)

   We or third-party advertising services providers selected by our
   customers may employ advertising pixels (a.k.a. clear gifs) on websites
   and advertisements that interact with some of our services. Pixels help
   us and our customers better manage content and advertising on websites
   by informing us what content is effective. Pixels are graphics embedded
   invisibly in web and advertising content and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence. Pixels work with cookies to record
   the interactions of users with websites and advertisements.

Statistical Identifiers and Cross-Device

   We may employ a technique known as statistical identifiers (a.k.a.
   device recognition). Like pixels, they help us and our customers to
   better manage content and advertising on devices by informing us
   (without using cookies) of the content with which users interact.
   Statistical identifiers collect various information about your device,
   such as your screen resolution, browser type, operating system and so
   on. Many devices have unique, or near unique, device profiles and so
   collecting this information enables us to determine to a reasonable
   level of statistical accuracy the level of users’ engagement with our
   or our customers’ advertisements and websites and to recognize the
   devices of users who interact with our or our customers’ content. We do
   not tie the information gathered through the use of statistical
   identifiers to any information that enables us to determine an
   individual’s actual identity. Sizmek’s cross device solutions attempt
   to use statistical identifiers to tailor your advertising experience
   across all of your devices, such as your computer, mobile phone and
   tablet. For example, using Sizmek’s cross device solutions, advertisers
   can limit the number of times you see the same ad on multiple devices,
   or serve you a follow-up ad on your computer after you have seen a
   related ad on your mobile device.

Precise Location Data

   Precise location data refers to the precise location of your device at
   a specific time. It is derived through technologies that are capable of
   determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of
   an individual or device, such as GPS-level latitude-longitude
   coordinates or location-based Wi-Fi triangulation. Sizmek uses precise
   location data to provide ads and other services to you in real time, if
   you consent to such use. If we obtain such data from our partners, we
   require them to obtain your consent before providing it to us.

Opt-Out & Your Choices

   To review your choices and set your opt-out options for your devices,
   including computer browsers and mobile browsers and devices, you must
   visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section here.

   Sizmek allows consumers to opt-out of Sizmek using our ad-serving
   cookie, mobile advertising identifiers, statistical identifiers and
   precise location data to serve online ads tailored to the consumer’s
   interests. Refusing cookies or use of mobile advertising or statistical
   identifiers or location data does not stop advertisements from being
   served to your computer or mobile device; rather, it means that Sizmek
   will not collect and use data related to cookies, mobile advertising
   identifiers or statistical identifiers, or precise location data to
   serve targeted advertisements to you. Please note that if you choose to
   opt out, we will be unable to serve you ads tailored to your interests,
   and you may receive the same ad multiple times. The Opt-Out Options and
   Additional Information section provides additional information to help
   you understand digital advertising and your choices for receiving
   interest-based ads.

Your Advertising Choices and Third Party Services

   Through our services and platform, our customers have access to
   services provided by third party companies with which Sizmek or our
   customers have partnered to assist our customers in delivering more
   relevant ads to you. If you would like to learn more about the
   practices of some of these companies and to make choices about their
   use of your information, please visit the sites of the NAI, DAA and
   EDAA for more information. Links to these sites, including services
   that permit you to opt-out of interest-based advertising by some of
   Sizmek’s partners, are provided in the section, Advertising Industry
   Sites for Control of Interest-Based Advertising on our Opt-Out Options
   and Additional Information section here. Some of our partners may not
   be covered by the NAI, DAA or EDAA programs, and you should consult the
   privacy policies on their websites for more information and to make
   choices about their services.

Do Not Track Disclosure

   Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users may set in
   certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow users another method of
   informing websites and services that they do not want certain
   information about their website visits collected over time and across
   websites.

   At present, we respect DNT signals that we believe are the result of an
   active choice made by the user; however, we do not recognize or respond
   to DNT signals from browsers or devices that turn these on by default.
   Please note that the online service and advertising industries
   currently are still working toward defining what “DNT” means, and
   devising a common approach to responding to DNT, and we may therefore
   change our treatment of DNT signals once a common approach is agreed.

Social Media Features

   Our website may include some social media features, such as the
   Facebook “Like” button, the Twitter “Tweet” button, and the LinkedIn
   “Share” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page
   you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie or employ similar
   technologies to enable the feature to function properly. Social media
   features are either hosted by a third party or directly on our website.
   Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
   policy of the company providing it, and you should consult their
   privacy policy for more information.

Information Relating to Children

   Our products and services are not designed or intended for children (as
   defined in applicable data protection laws). We do not knowingly
   collect personal information from children on the websites we operate
   or through our services. Please advise us if you are aware of our
   having received personal information from a child, in which case we
   will take appropriate steps to delete it. For these purposes,
   “children” and “child” refer to ages defined by applicable law in the
   countries where we provide our services.

International Data Transfers and Our Privacy Shield Compliance

   The personal information Sizmek processes may be transferred to, and
   processed in, any country in which we, our group companies, or our
   service providers or partners operate, and this may include countries
   other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may
   have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your
   country.

   However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your
   personal information will remain protected in accordance with this
   Privacy Notice. In particular, Sizmek complies with the EU-US Privacy
   Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth
   by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
   retention of personal information from European Economic Area member
   countries and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Sizmek
   has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of
   Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data
   Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and
   Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this
   privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
   Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield
   program, and to view our certification page, please visit
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/

   The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the enforcement
   authority with jurisdiction over this compliance with the Privacy
   Shield. In compliance with the US-EU and Swiss-US Privacy Shield,
   Sizmek commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our
   collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss
   individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy
   should first contact Sizmek US at the contact information provided in
   the “If You Have Questions About This Policy” section below.

   Sizmek US has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints
   from EEA or Swiss citizens or residents regarding transfers of their
   personal data under the Privacy Shield Principles to a non-profit
   alternative dispute resolution provider, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD,
   located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better
   Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
   complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please
   visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more
   information and to file a complaint. Please note that if your complaint
   is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a
   binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield
   Panel for EU or Swiss individuals.

   When Sizmek US transfers personal information about EU or Swiss
   individuals to other third parties, it will do so in accordance with
   the Onward Transfer principle of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
   Principles. In these cases, Sizmek US is potentially liable if such
   third parties do not provide the same level of protection as the
   Privacy Shield Principles.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework

   Sizmek complies with the policies of the IAB Europe Transparency and
   Consent Framework, as a registered vendor on the IAB Europe’s global
   vendor List. We process personal data for the purposes described in
   this privacy policy. For more information, please visit
   http://advertisingconsent.eu/.

   Where publishers have chosen to integrate an advertising consent
   interface on their sites or apps that conforms to the requirements of
   the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework, we will respect
   and comply with the signals that are passed to us in accordance with
   the Framework.

Legal Basis and Purposes For Processing

   If you are a user from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for
   collecting and using the personal information described above will
   depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context
   in which we collect it.

   However, we will normally process personal information from you only
   where we have your consent to do so (including as a processor for a
   third party data controller that has obtained your consent), where we
   need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where
   the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by
   your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In
   some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
   information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to
   protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example,
   to process your request to exercise your rights regarding your personal
   data or that of another person who shares your device).

   If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
   requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear
   at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
   personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
   consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

   If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
   legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information,
   please contact us using the contact details provided under the “If You
   Have Questions About This Policy” heading below.

Your Data Protection Rights

You have the following data protection rights:

     * If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your
       personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us
       using the contact details provided under the “If You Have Questions
       About This Policy” heading below or via this web service.
     * In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area,
       you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us
       to restrict processing of your personal information or request
       portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise
       these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided
       under the “If You Have Questions About This Policy” heading below
       or via this web service.
     * You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send
       you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the
       “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send
       you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal
       marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the
       contact details provided under the “If You Have Questions About
       This Policy” heading below.
     *  Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal

   Advertising Industry Sites for Control of Interest-Based Advertising
   Sizmek participates in advertising industry self-regulatory programs
   that allow users to opt-out of interest-based advertising (aka online
   behavioral advertising) by multiple digital advertising service
   providers, including Sizmek. To do this, the following advertising
   industry programs maintain sites that enable user controls for
   interest-based advertising:
     * Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)
     * Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
     * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)

   To access the NAI, DAA and EDAA sites and select your opt-out options
   for interest-based advertising, visit any of the sites below. Note: You
   do not have to opt-out at each site. Sizmek participates in all of
   them, so opting-out on any of these sites is sufficient.

   NAI: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by NAI members, visit the
   NAI site here.

   DAA: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by DAA’s participating
   companies, visit the DAA site here.

   EDAA: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by EDAA’s participating
   companies, visit the EDAA site here.

   For additional information, visit the sites identified above and see
   Your Advertising Choices and Third Party Services in our privacy
   policy.
   Digital Advertising Alliance AppChoices App After installing the DAA
   AppChoices app on a mobile device, permits the user to control
   interest-based advertising in applications on that device. For more
   information and to download AppChoices for your mobile devices, visit
   the DAA page here or visit your device’s app store and search for
   “AppChoices”
   Mobile Advertising Identifiers Use mobile device settings to stop or

   mobile operating systems, visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices page here.

   For additional information, see Mobile Opt-Out Methods below.
   Cross Device Opt-Out Guidance Cross device solutions attempt to tailor
   your advertising experience across all devices that may belong to the
   same person, such as your computer, mobile phone and tablet. For
   example, using Sizmek’s cross device solutions, advertisers can limit
   the number of times you see the same ad on multiple devices, or serve
   you a follow-up ad on your computer after you have seen a related ad on
   your mobile device. Note that our cross device solution is based on
   probabilistic data only, which means we are guessing which devices
   belong to the same person but don’t actually know if they do. To stop
   cross device identification by Sizmek, use the opt-out options noted
   above on each device that you use.

   For additional information, see Cross Device Opt-Out below.
   Precise Location Data Precise location data refers to the precise
   location of your device at a specific time and is used to provide ads
   and other services to you in real time, if you consent to such use.
   Sizmek does not use precise location data unless you have provided your
   consent to Sizmek or our partner who has provided your precise location
   data to us. You can control the use of your precise location data
   through the settings on your devices, including specific application
   settings in mobile phones and browser add-ons.

   To manage location settings for apps on Google Android devices, see
   Google’s instructions here.

   To manage location settings for apps on Apple iOS devices, see Apple’s
   instructions here.

   To manage location settings for apps on other mobile devices, see the
   instructions provided by the device manufacturer or the provider of the
   operating system for that device.

     * Types of Ad Fraud (and What You Can Do About Them)
       January 11, 2019

   Ad fraud is a big, costly problem in our industry. To fight it, you
   have to understand the different forms it can take. The brand safety
   experts at Peer39 typically divide ad fraud into three categories:
   non-human traffic (i.e., bots); ads with zero chance of being seen
   (i.e., zero-percent viewability); and intentional misrepresentation.
   The imposters who are responsible for these kinds of fraud are savvy,
   and they are continually finding new and more sophisticated ways to
   make money by defrauding advertisers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here’s a closer look at some of the most common types of fraud:

Bot basics

   General invalid traffic (GIVT) are scripts that run from a server such
   as Amazon Web Services or some other hosting provider. As their name
   implies, these bots are usually easy to identify because they have a
   static IP, user agent, and cookie ID. This makes fingerprinting them
   pretty easy using DSP auction logs or even web server logs to spot
   abnormally high clickthrough rate (CTR) or unexpected spikes in traffic
   that are the signatures of simple bots.

   Sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT) is not as easy to identify. These
   bots rotate user agents, using random proxies to rotate IP addresses,
   and they mimic normal “human” CTRs, so they are more challenging to
   detect. They are also now capable of completing complicated tasks like
   filling out forms or completing videos. Sophisticated bots can even put
   items in shopping carts and visit multiple sites to generate histories
   and cookies—making them look attractive to advertisers and publishers.

The unviewable

   Ad stacking is a common way that fraudulent publishers get credit for
   running an ad that is actually hidden behind other ads and not
   viewable. The publisher can thereby generate multiple impressions for a
   single page view, even when only the top ad in the “stack” is ever
   seen.

Site scams

   Domain spoofing is a scheme employed by deceitful publishers, ad
   exchanges, or networks to obscure the nature of their traffic to
   resemble legitimate websites. For example, an advertiser might sign off
   on a contract to run a campaign on a legitimate entertainment website
   with very high monthly traffic, but instead its ads end up on an
   unknown site. This practice is most prevalent in the programmatic space
   where publishers are sometimes allowed to declare their own domains and
   label their own site IDs. Spoofed domains are not just fake website
   addresses, they are also banner farms that contain bad content.

   Ghost sites are among the most difficult fraud methods for advertisers
   to spot. Fraudsters create content farms and use bots to mimic human
   traffic. The sites may then be introduced to a legitimate ad exchange,
   where ad impressions are made available for advertisers to buy
   programmatically. Exchanges usually spot these schemes quickly, but
   even a short lifespan can be profitable to the ghost site creators.

   Zero-ad sites are those where advertising is forbidden, such as
   government or educational sites. But fraudsters still find ways to
   inject ads into them when a user downloads and installs a browser
   extension or app (such as a free PDF converter or browser toolbar)
   bundled with software that quietly injects unwanted ads into the user’s
   browser.

Fraud is lucrative

   The scale of online ad fraud has a significant impact on advertising
   ROI and advertiser confidence because all those falsified impressions
   and clicks cost money without yielding conversions or revenue. It’s
   estimated that fraud consumes $1 of every $3 spent on digital
   advertising. In 2018, advertisers lost an estimated $51 million every
   day to fraud, a figure that is expected to more than double by 2022.
   Time and time again, advertisers unwittingly reinvest in fraudulent
   inventory because it appears on reports to be driving results. Worst of
   all, ad fraud is not technically illegal, so there is minimal risk for
   bad actors.

Protection is possible

   Because fraud schemes continually evolve, effective fraud prevention
   requires staying one step ahead of their game. Peer39 does this by
   tackling the problem from every angle, both before and after the buy.
   Peer39 pre-bid antifraud targeting helps marketers exclude fraud from
   the buy up front, eliminating zero-ad sites and other fake inventory.
   Peer39 post-buy solutions offer multichannel, AI-driven fraud detection
   and filtration that enables you to monitor viewability and detect bots
   and other invalid traffic threats—even difficult-to-detect schemes and
   domain spoofing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Fraud isn’t going anywhere, but with vigilance, you can significantly
   reduce your exposure and protect your investment.

   Contact a your account rep or a Peer39 account manager to keep your
   next campaign fraud-free.

Sizmek Opt-Out

   For information on interest-based advertising, including to understand
   what opting-out means and your opt-out choices, please see the section
   headed “Opt-Out and Your Choices” below. To actually review your
   choices and set your control and opt-out options for your devices,
   including computer browsers and mobile browsers and devices, you must
   visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section here.

Privacy Practices for Our Sizmek Websites (www.sizmek.com)

   Sizmek Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Sizmek”, “we” and “us”) firmly
   believe in the importance of online privacy. We do not collect any
   information that enables us to determine your actual identity before,
   during or after your visit to this corporate website (sizmek.com) or
   our regional sites accessible from this website, other than your
   information that you voluntarily supply to us (e.g. by submitting
   information through the “Contact Us” form). When you provide your
   information directly to us, this information is used by Sizmek solely
   for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. More
   information about opting out of our use of cookies on our websites is
   available by clicking on the Cookie Consent link in the lower, left
   corner of the home page of our website.

Privacy Practices for Advertising and Content Served by Sizmek

   We respect your right to privacy throughout all of the services we
   provide. In particular, as a member of the Network Advertising
   Initiative (NAI), Sizmek adheres to the NAI Codes of Conduct as well as
   the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the
   European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (EDAA) regarding
   our use of data for interest-based advertising purposes. We also comply
   with the policies of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework,
   as a registered vendor on the Global Vendor List. For more information
   about these organizations, their policies and interest-based
   advertising, please visit their websites by clicking on the following
   links: NAI (here), DAA (here), EDAA (here), or the IAB Europe
   Transparency and Consent Framework (here).

Data Collection through Sizmek Services

What do Sizmek’s Services do?

   Through our services, our customers – advertisers, advertising
   agencies, publishers, and other users of Sizmek services – may collect
   and use information about your device to provide you with a more
   tailored online advertising experience. Our customers use Sizmek’s
   tools and services to create and deliver advertisements, to monitor the
   success of and manage advertising campaigns, to detect and minimize
   advertising fraud and, ultimately, to present you with advertisements
   that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you. Delivering
   relevant ads that are tailored to users’ interests is known as
   “interest based advertising” (sometimes also referred to as “behavioral
   advertising” or “targeted advertising”).

How does interest based advertising work?

   To perform interest based advertising, Sizmek’s cookies and similar
   technologies (described below) are deployed on your devices, and
   through the third-party websites and mobile applications you use, to
   collect information about your interests and behavior on the internet.
   The information we collect is associated with your cookie identifiers
   and/or mobile advertising identifiers (if you are using a mobile
   device), as well as your IP address. We never collect information about
   your actual identity.

   We use the information we collect for online ad tailoring purposes or
   to deliver an advertisement to you from a company whose website or
   mobile application you have visited or whose advertisement you have
   viewed in the past. As explained above, our technology employs cookies,
   device identifiers and similar technologies (like pixels and
   statistical device identifiers) to collect information about your
   browser or device, the sites it has visited and the apps it has used,
   the advertisements served to it, interactions with those
   advertisements, and, where available, the approximate geographic
   location of the device (“behavioral information”). This behavioral
   information is collected in the course of providing our customers with
   ad-serving and campaign management services and used for the purpose of
   helping our customers determine which advertisement is suitable to be
   delivered to you.

   This behavioral information, which does not enable Sizmek to determine
   your actual identity, may be shared with our customers and Sizmek’s and
   our customers’ partners for their lawful advertising purposes. In some
   areas of the world, certain behavioral information, such as IP
   addresses, cookie identifiers and device identifiers, may be considered
   to be personal information (sometimes referred to as personal data)
   that is protected under applicable laws. Where this is the case, we
   comply with applicable laws regarding our use and processing of
   personal information.

Cross-device interest based advertising

   We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile
   devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on
   your devices that interact with the internet. Sizmek engages in cross
   device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data
   from separate devices that have been determined through statistical
   analysis to be linked or related. Sizmek, or partners that we employ to
   provide this service, use cross device data to provide interest based
   advertising services to our customers and to deliver tailored ads to
   users across multiple devices.

Information Collected by Customers and their Partners

   Please note that Sizmek customers sometimes include their own (or their
   partners’) ad-tags, pixels or similar technologies within
   advertisements that Sizmek serves to websites, in order to set and read
   their own cookies which Sizmek does not control.

   In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses
   Sizmek services, or click through an ad to the website or online
   service of one of our customers, those customers may collect additional
   information about your visit beyond the information described in this
   privacy policy. They may also allow other companies (such as other ad
   networks or web analytics services) to collect information through
   mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and similar technologies.

   Sizmek is not responsible for and cannot control the data collection
   and use practices of its customers or their partners. You should read
   the privacy notices of the websites you visit and the online services
   and interactive ads that you use to understand what information
   companies collect and how they use that information.

Sharing of Behavioral Information with Customers

   We share the behavioral information collected from our advertising
   technologies with our customers and partners for their lawful
   advertising purposes. We may also share behavioral information with our
   customers’ service providers to enable them to provide services on our
   customers’ behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads
   for our customers. We use reasonable efforts to require our customers
   and partners to treat the behavioral information we share with them in
   accordance with applicable laws, the terms of the contracts we may have
   with them, and their own privacy policies, but cannot control their use
   of this information.

Information Sizmek Collects on Behalf of Third Parties

   On occasion, at the request and on behalf of a customer, Sizmek may
   collect personal information supplied voluntarily by consumers through
   their interaction with data collection fields in the body of
   advertisements or on websites (such as name, email, etc.). This
   personal information is provided directly to the customer on whose
   behalf the information was collected, or the customer’s service
   providers, and is processed by Sizmek only to the extent and as long as
   is necessary to provide the advertising services for which the personal
   information was collected. Our customers are limited by contract to use
   this personal information solely for the purposes identified within the
   advertisement to provide consumers with requested goods, services, or
   information as established within that customer’s privacy policy.
   Sizmek is not responsible for its customers’ use of this voluntarily
   supplied data. Sizmek does not distribute this personal information to
   any party other than those indicated within the advertisement or, at
   the customers’ direction, their service providers. Sizmek never
   associates any of this personal information with any other data (such
   as behavioral information) gathered or used in the delivery of
   advertisements.

Links to Other Sites

   Our site and the advertisements we serve on behalf of customers may
   contain links to other sites whose information practices may be
   different from ours. In addition, there may be links to other sites
   provided within the body of advertisements on other websites. We do not
   have control over the information that is submitted to, or collected
   by, these third parties. You should consult the privacy policy of these
   other sites to learn how your privacy is protected.

Interest Segments

   Sizmek, our customers, and our respective partners collect behavioral
   information to create interest segments. An interest segment is a set
   of profiles of users or their devices that are grouped according to
   user characteristics or interests, such as “Autos,” “Travel” or
   “Cooking.” Each profile is an anonymous or pseudonymous identifier that
   is tied to users’ devices. As a user’s device interacts with ads,
   websites and mobile applications, the characteristics and interests of
   the users of such devices can be collected and inferred. These
   characteristics and interests are represented by the identifier
   associated with your device, and then grouped with other, similar
   identifiers to create an interest segment. Sizmek, our customers and
   our respective partners use interest segments to deliver ads to your
   devices that are related to your interests. We require our partners to
   treat the information used to create these segments in accordance with
   applicable laws, the terms of our contracts with them, and their
   privacy policies. You can opt-out of interest based advertising based
   on interest segments at any time, as described under the heading
   “Opt-Out and Your Choices” below.

   We also receive interest segments and other pseudonymous information
   from third parties, when they choose to provide it to us and are
   lawfully permitted to do so. This information may include identifiers
   (like mobile advertising IDs) and interest-based advertising data tied
   to those identifiers, including segments provided by third-party data
   providers for our clients to use in delivering tailored ads through
   Sizmek’s services. Sizmek does not use this data to determine your
   actual identity.

   Sizmek does not knowingly create or use interest segments based on
   sensitive categories such as race, religion, sexual orientation or
   health; however, Sizmek, our customers and our respective partners may
   use interest segments related to health (which are not comprised of
   sensitive health data) to provide tailored ads that may be of interest
   to you.

Data Security and Retention

   We have appropriate technical and organizational security measures in
   place to help protect the personal information that is submitted to us
   voluntarily through our web site or collected through interactions with
   our services. However, no system can be completely secure, and we make
   no guarantees as to the safety or security of any information
   transmitted to or from this site or through our services. Sizmek
   retains information we receive from your device in log files that is
   stored for up to 13 months from the time it is stored, after which time
   the log files are deleted.

Our Use of Cookies and Similar Advertising Technologies

   This section provides additional information about the various
   technologies that Sizmek uses to deliver ads to you and services to our
   customers, including services that collect behavioral information when
   you interact with our customers’ ads or the sites and applications
   where their ads are provided. To learn how to control or opt-out of our
   use of these technologies, including to understand what opting-out
   means and your opt-out choices, please read the section, “Opt-Out &
   Your Choices” below. If you wish to exercise your control or opt-out
   options, visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section
   here.

Cookies

   We use cookies to provide functionality to our website and also to
   deliver our advertising services to our customers. A cookie is a small
   text file that can be stored on your computer or device when you view
   an advertisement or website relating to one of our customers. The
   cookie does not contain your name, address, phone number, email
   address, or anything that enables us to determine your actual identity.
   Instead, Sizmek uses cookies to collect behavioral information such as
   a computer’s IP address, the type of the computer’s operating system,
   the type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and
   at what time. Sizmek also uses cookies to collect demographic
   information collected through anonymous online surveys such as gender
   and age range, as well as information about your browsing activity for
   the purpose of delivering advertising based on preferences or interests
   known or inferred from the data collected. We also use cookies to
   determine if we have already served an ad to a specific user and to cap
   the frequency that they are presented to the same user.

   To learn more about the cookies we serve when you visit the Sizmek
   website (including how to opt-out of them), please visit our Cookie
   Consent link in the lower, left corner of our website.

Mobile Advertising Identifiers

   Most mobile devices include an identifier that allows application
   publishers and marketers to track user activity on mobile devices for
   advertising purposes (for example, Google’s Android Advertising
   Identifier (AAID) and Apple’s Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)).
   Sizmek, Sizmek’s customers and our respective partners may use mobile
   advertising identifiers for the same purposes for which we use cookies
   and statistical identifiers, including serving ads based on precise
   location data when you have consented to share. See the below section
   on precise location data to learn more about how and when Sizmek
   requires opt-in consent for the processing and use of precise location
   data.

Log files

   Like most websites and advertising services providers, we gather
   certain information about your use of the Sizmek website and services
   automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not
   allow us to determine your actual identity, to analyze trends, to
   administer the site and services, to track users’ movements around the
   Sizmek website and the devices to which we provide advertisements, and
   to gather demographic information about our users who interact with our
   services as a whole. We obfuscate IP addresses in any reporting
   information that is shared with or made available to our clients.

Pixels (also known as Clear Gifs)

   We or third-party advertising services providers selected by our
   customers may employ advertising pixels (a.k.a. clear gifs) on websites
   and advertisements that interact with some of our services. Pixels help
   us and our customers better manage content and advertising on websites
   by informing us what content is effective. Pixels are graphics embedded
   invisibly in web and advertising content and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence. Pixels work with cookies to record
   the interactions of users with websites and advertisements.

Statistical Identifiers and Cross-Device

   We may employ a technique known as statistical identifiers (a.k.a.
   device recognition). Like pixels, they help us and our customers to
   better manage content and advertising on devices by informing us
   (without using cookies) of the content with which users interact.
   Statistical identifiers collect various information about your device,
   such as your screen resolution, browser type, operating system and so
   on. Many devices have unique, or near unique, device profiles and so
   collecting this information enables us to determine to a reasonable
   level of statistical accuracy the level of users’ engagement with our
   or our customers’ advertisements and websites and to recognize the
   devices of users who interact with our or our customers’ content. We do
   not tie the information gathered through the use of statistical
   identifiers to any information that enables us to determine an
   individual’s actual identity. Sizmek’s cross device solutions attempt
   to use statistical identifiers to tailor your advertising experience
   across all of your devices, such as your computer, mobile phone and
   tablet. For example, using Sizmek’s cross device solutions, advertisers
   can limit the number of times you see the same ad on multiple devices,
   or serve you a follow-up ad on your computer after you have seen a
   related ad on your mobile device.

Precise Location Data

   Precise location data refers to the precise location of your device at
   a specific time. It is derived through technologies that are capable of
   determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of
   an individual or device, such as GPS-level latitude-longitude
   coordinates or location-based Wi-Fi triangulation. Sizmek uses precise
   location data to provide ads and other services to you in real time, if
   you consent to such use. If we obtain such data from our partners, we
   require them to obtain your consent before providing it to us.

Opt-Out & Your Choices

   To review your choices and set your opt-out options for your devices,
   including computer browsers and mobile browsers and devices, you must
   visit our Opt-Out Options and Additional Information section here.

   Sizmek allows consumers to opt-out of Sizmek using our ad-serving
   cookie, mobile advertising identifiers, statistical identifiers and
   precise location data to serve online ads tailored to the consumer’s
   interests. Refusing cookies or use of mobile advertising or statistical
   identifiers or location data does not stop advertisements from being
   served to your computer or mobile device; rather, it means that Sizmek
   will not collect and use data related to cookies, mobile advertising
   identifiers or statistical identifiers, or precise location data to
   serve targeted advertisements to you. Please note that if you choose to
   opt out, we will be unable to serve you ads tailored to your interests,
   and you may receive the same ad multiple times. The Opt-Out Options and
   Additional Information section provides additional information to help
   you understand digital advertising and your choices for receiving
   interest-based ads.

Your Advertising Choices and Third Party Services

   Through our services and platform, our customers have access to
   services provided by third party companies with which Sizmek or our
   customers have partnered to assist our customers in delivering more
   relevant ads to you. If you would like to learn more about the
   practices of some of these companies and to make choices about their
   use of your information, please visit the sites of the NAI, DAA and
   EDAA for more information. Links to these sites, including services
   that permit you to opt-out of interest-based advertising by some of
   Sizmek’s partners, are provided in the section, Advertising Industry
   Sites for Control of Interest-Based Advertising on our Opt-Out Options
   and Additional Information section here. Some of our partners may not
   be covered by the NAI, DAA or EDAA programs, and you should consult the
   privacy policies on their websites for more information and to make
   choices about their services.

Do Not Track Disclosure

   Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users may set in
   certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow users another method of
   informing websites and services that they do not want certain
   information about their website visits collected over time and across
   websites.

   At present, we respect DNT signals that we believe are the result of an
   active choice made by the user; however, we do not recognize or respond
   to DNT signals from browsers or devices that turn these on by default.
   Please note that the online service and advertising industries
   currently are still working toward defining what “DNT” means, and
   devising a common approach to responding to DNT, and we may therefore
   change our treatment of DNT signals once a common approach is agreed.

Social Media Features

   Our website may include some social media features, such as the
   Facebook “Like” button, the Twitter “Tweet” button, and the LinkedIn
   “Share” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page
   you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie or employ similar
   technologies to enable the feature to function properly. Social media
   features are either hosted by a third party or directly on our website.
   Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
   policy of the company providing it, and you should consult their
   privacy policy for more information.

Information Relating to Children

   Our products and services are not designed or intended for children (as
   defined in applicable data protection laws). We do not knowingly
   collect personal information from children on the websites we operate
   or through our services. Please advise us if you are aware of our
   having received personal information from a child, in which case we
   will take appropriate steps to delete it. For these purposes,
   “children” and “child” refer to ages defined by applicable law in the
   countries where we provide our services.

International Data Transfers and Our Privacy Shield Compliance

   The personal information Sizmek processes may be transferred to, and
   processed in, any country in which we, our group companies, or our
   service providers or partners operate, and this may include countries
   other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may
   have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your
   country.

   However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your
   personal information will remain protected in accordance with this
   Privacy Notice. In particular, Sizmek complies with the EU-US Privacy
   Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth
   by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
   retention of personal information from European Economic Area member
   countries and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Sizmek
   has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of
   Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data
   Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and
   Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this
   privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
   Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield
   program, and to view our certification page, please visit
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/

   The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the enforcement
   authority with jurisdiction over this compliance with the Privacy
   Shield. In compliance with the US-EU and Swiss-US Privacy Shield,
   Sizmek commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our
   collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss
   individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy
   should first contact Sizmek US at the contact information provided in
   the “If You Have Questions About This Policy” section below.

   Sizmek US has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints
   from EEA or Swiss citizens or residents regarding transfers of their
   personal data under the Privacy Shield Principles to a non-profit
   alternative dispute resolution provider, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD,
   located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better
   Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
   complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please
   visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more
   information and to file a complaint. Please note that if your complaint
   is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a
   binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield
   Panel for EU or Swiss individuals.

   When Sizmek US transfers personal information about EU or Swiss
   individuals to other third parties, it will do so in accordance with
   the Onward Transfer principle of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
   Principles. In these cases, Sizmek US is potentially liable if such
   third parties do not provide the same level of protection as the
   Privacy Shield Principles.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework

   Sizmek complies with the policies of the IAB Europe Transparency and
   Consent Framework, as a registered vendor on the IAB Europe’s global
   vendor List. We process personal data for the purposes described in
   this privacy policy. For more information, please visit
   http://advertisingconsent.eu/.

   Where publishers have chosen to integrate an advertising consent
   interface on their sites or apps that conforms to the requirements of
   the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework, we will respect
   and comply with the signals that are passed to us in accordance with
   the Framework.

Legal Basis and Purposes For Processing

   If you are a user from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for
   collecting and using the personal information described above will
   depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context
   in which we collect it.

   However, we will normally process personal information from you only
   where we have your consent to do so (including as a processor for a
   third party data controller that has obtained your consent), where we
   need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where
   the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by
   your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In
   some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
   information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to
   protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example,
   to process your request to exercise your rights regarding your personal
   data or that of another person who shares your device).

   If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
   requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear
   at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
   personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
   consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

   If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
   legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information,
   please contact us using the contact details provided under the “If You
   Have Questions About This Policy” heading below.

Your Data Protection Rights

You have the following data protection rights:

     * If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your
       personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us
       using the contact details provided under the “If You Have Questions
       About This Policy” heading below or via this web service.
     * In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area,
       you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us
       to restrict processing of your personal information or request

   Advertising Industry Sites for Control of Interest-Based Advertising
   Sizmek participates in advertising industry self-regulatory programs
   that allow users to opt-out of interest-based advertising (aka online
   behavioral advertising) by multiple digital advertising service
   providers, including Sizmek. To do this, the following advertising
   industry programs maintain sites that enable user controls for
   interest-based advertising:
     * Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)
     * Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
     * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)

   To access the NAI, DAA and EDAA sites and select your opt-out options
   for interest-based advertising, visit any of the sites below. Note: You
   do not have to opt-out at each site. Sizmek participates in all of
   them, so opting-out on any of these sites is sufficient.

   NAI: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by NAI members, visit the
   NAI site here.

   DAA: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by DAA’s participating
   companies, visit the DAA site here.

   EDAA: To opt-out of interest-based advertising by EDAA’s participating
   companies, visit the EDAA site here.

   For additional information, visit the sites identified above and see
   Your Advertising Choices and Third Party Services in our privacy
   policy.
   Digital Advertising Alliance AppChoices App After installing the DAA
   AppChoices app on a mobile device, permits the user to control
   interest-based advertising in applications on that device. For more
   information and to download AppChoices for your mobile devices, visit
   the DAA page here or visit your device’s app store and search for
   “AppChoices”
   Mobile Advertising Identifiers Use mobile device settings to stop or

   Cross Device Opt-Out Guidance Cross device solutions attempt to tailor
   your advertising experience across all devices that may belong to the
   same person, such as your computer, mobile phone and tablet. For
   example, using Sizmek’s cross device solutions, advertisers can limit
   the number of times you see the same ad on multiple devices, or serve
   you a follow-up ad on your computer after you have seen a related ad on
   your mobile device. Note that our cross device solution is based on
   probabilistic data only, which means we are guessing which devices
   belong to the same person but don’t actually know if they do. To stop
   cross device identification by Sizmek, use the opt-out options noted
   above on each device that you use.

   For additional information, see Cross Device Opt-Out below.
   Precise Location Data Precise location data refers to the precise
   location of your device at a specific time and is used to provide ads
   and other services to you in real time, if you consent to such use.
   Sizmek does not use precise location data unless you have provided your
   consent to Sizmek or our partner who has provided your precise location
   data to us. You can control the use of your precise location data
   through the settings on your devices, including specific application
   settings in mobile phones and browser add-ons.

   To manage location settings for apps on Google Android devices, see
   Google’s instructions here.

   To manage location settings for apps on Apple iOS devices, see Apple’s
   instructions here.

   To manage location settings for apps on other mobile devices, see the
   instructions provided by the device manufacturer or the provider of the
   operating system for that device.

     * Types of Ad Fraud (and What You Can Do About Them)
       January 11, 2019

   Ad fraud is a big, costly problem in our industry. To fight it, you
   have to understand the different forms it can take. The brand safety
   experts at Peer39 typically divide ad fraud into three categories:
   non-human traffic (i.e., bots); ads with zero chance of being seen
   (i.e., zero-percent viewability); and intentional misrepresentation.
   The imposters who are responsible for these kinds of fraud are savvy,
   and they are continually finding new and more sophisticated ways to
   make money by defrauding advertisers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here’s a closer look at some of the most common types of fraud:

Bot basics

   General invalid traffic (GIVT) are scripts that run from a server such
   as Amazon Web Services or some other hosting provider. As their name
   implies, these bots are usually easy to identify because they have a
   static IP, user agent, and cookie ID. This makes fingerprinting them
   pretty easy using DSP auction logs or even web server logs to spot
   abnormally high clickthrough rate (CTR) or unexpected spikes in traffic
   that are the signatures of simple bots.

   Sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT) is not as easy to identify. These
   bots rotate user agents, using random proxies to rotate IP addresses,
   and they mimic normal “human” CTRs, so they are more challenging to
   detect. They are also now capable of completing complicated tasks like
   filling out forms or completing videos. Sophisticated bots can even put
   items in shopping carts and visit multiple sites to generate histories
   and cookies—making them look attractive to advertisers and publishers.

The unviewable

   Ad stacking is a common way that fraudulent publishers get credit for
   running an ad that is actually hidden behind other ads and not
   viewable. The publisher can thereby generate multiple impressions for a
   single page view, even when only the top ad in the “stack” is ever
   seen.

Site scams

   Domain spoofing is a scheme employed by deceitful publishers, ad
   exchanges, or networks to obscure the nature of their traffic to
   resemble legitimate websites. For example, an advertiser might sign off
   on a contract to run a campaign on a legitimate entertainment website
   with very high monthly traffic, but instead its ads end up on an
   unknown site. This practice is most prevalent in the programmatic space
   where publishers are sometimes allowed to declare their own domains and
   label their own site IDs. Spoofed domains are not just fake website
   addresses, they are also banner farms that contain bad content.

   Ghost sites are among the most difficult fraud methods for advertisers
   to spot. Fraudsters create content farms and use bots to mimic human
   traffic. The sites may then be introduced to a legitimate ad exchange,
   where ad impressions are made available for advertisers to buy
   programmatically. Exchanges usually spot these schemes quickly, but
   even a short lifespan can be profitable to the ghost site creators.

   Zero-ad sites are those where advertising is forbidden, such as
   government or educational sites. But fraudsters still find ways to
   inject ads into them when a user downloads and installs a browser
   extension or app (such as a free PDF converter or browser toolbar)
   bundled with software that quietly injects unwanted ads into the user’s
   browser.

Fraud is lucrative

   The scale of online ad fraud has a significant impact on advertising
   ROI and advertiser confidence because all those falsified impressions
   and clicks cost money without yielding conversions or revenue. It’s
   estimated that fraud consumes $1 of every $3 spent on digital
   advertising. In 2018, advertisers lost an estimated $51 million every
   day to fraud, a figure that is expected to more than double by 2022.
   Time and time again, advertisers unwittingly reinvest in fraudulent
   inventory because it appears on reports to be driving results. Worst of
   all, ad fraud is not technically illegal, so there is minimal risk for
   bad actors.

Protection is possible

   Because fraud schemes continually evolve, effective fraud prevention
   requires staying one step ahead of their game. Peer39 does this by
   tackling the problem from every angle, both before and after the buy.
   Peer39 pre-bid antifraud targeting helps marketers exclude fraud from
   the buy up front, eliminating zero-ad sites and other fake inventory.
   Peer39 post-buy solutions offer multichannel, AI-driven fraud detection
   and filtration that enables you to monitor viewability and detect bots
   and other invalid traffic threats—even difficult-to-detect schemes and
   domain spoofing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Fraud isn’t going anywhere, but with vigilance, you can significantly
