Code of conduct

   For researchers and for the recruitment of researcher
   The code of conduct for the recruitment of researchers consists of a
   set of general principles and requirements that should be followed by
   employers and/or funders when appointing or recruiting researchers.
   These principles and requirements should ensure observance of values
   such as transparency of the recruitment process and equal treatment of
   all applicants, in particular with regard to the development of an
   attractive, open and sustainable European labour market for
   researchers, and are complementary to those outlined in the European
   Charter for Researchers.

   Institutions and employers adhering to the Code of Conduct will openly
   demonstrate their commitment to act in a responsible and respectable
   way and to provide fair framework conditions to researchers, with a
   clear intention to contribute to the advancement of the European
   Research Area.

   Code of conduct for researchers
   UNU-MERIT and its School of Governance adhere to the European Charter
   for Researchers as well as the  Netherlands Code of Conduct for
   Scientific Practice. Staff, researchers and PhD fellows are expected to
   behave in line with codes of conduct for researchers.  The code
   contains principles that all scientific practicioners allied with a
   university should observe individually, among each other and towards
   society. The principles can be read as general notions of good
   scientific practice.
