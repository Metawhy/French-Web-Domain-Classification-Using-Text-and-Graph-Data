                                What is AXIe?

   An open system modular instrumentation standard based on AdvancedTCA®,
   that delivers high performance
   instrumentation for aerospace defense, high energy physics,
   semiconductor test and other industries.

   What advantages does it bring?

     * “Big brother to PXI.”  Same PCIe fabric and programming, but with
       ...

     * Horizontal configurations for minimal rack space, vertical for
       large systems
     * Larger boards for highest rack and power densities per rack inch
     * High speed trigger, timing, and local bus
     * Semiconductor test extensions
     * ATCA compatibility
     * Optional LAN fabric
     * Integrates easily with PXI, LXI and IVI

                                What is ODI?

     ODI is the abbreviation for Optical Data Interface, a new high-speed
     interface standard for advanced instrumentation and embedded
     systems. ODI breaks speed and distance barriers by relying on
     optical communication between devices, over a simple pluggable
     optical cable.

     With speeds up to 80 GBytes/s, ODI is designed to address
     challenging applications in 5G communications, mil/aero systems,
     high-speed data acquisition, and communication research. Though
     managed by the AXIe Consortium, ODI is not specific to AXIe, and
     works equally well with any product format, whether AXIe, PXI, LXI,
     VPX, or a traditional bench instrument design. Standard ODI ports
     enable communication between instruments, processors, storage, and
     embedded devices.

     More information, including overviews and specifications, are
     available on the ODI Specifications page.
