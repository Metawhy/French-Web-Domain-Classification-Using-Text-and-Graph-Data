SCIENTISTS’ FEEDBACK

SUMMARY

   This Breitbart article by James Delingpole claims that the observed
   warming of Earth’s surface temperatures is largely a fabrication by
   scientists who have altered the measurements. The source for this claim
   is a document written by three individuals who have no track record of
   publishing scientific research on the topic, and have not submitted
   their work to peer-reviewed scientific journals, but simply uploaded a
   pdf on a wordpress blog.

   Scientists who reviewed the article found that its claims are false and
   misleading. Data are indeed adjusted to accurately account for things
   like changes in the instruments used to make measurements or the
   relocation of weather stations. However, the impact of these
   adjustments on the global temperature record is actually small, and the
   warming trend of the last century would appear to be larger without the
   adjustments, in contradiction with the claims in the Breitbart article.

GUEST COMMENTS

   Zeke Hausfather, Research Scientist, Berkeley Earth:
   In general, their argument about removing cyclical behavior comes from
   comparing old 1980s NASA GISTemp records to those of today. What they
   don’t tell you is that the 1980 record in question (in addition to
   being graphed on a different baseline than all the other series) only
   comes from around 500 land stations almost entirely in the Northern
   Hemisphere and does not include any ocean data at all.

   There is a well known warm period in the mid-to-high latitude land
   areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the 1930s and 1940s, but it does
   not really show up much in the oceans and not at all in the S
   Hemisphere. As scientists have collected more historical temperature
   records from around the world in the past 35 years, we have created
   more complete records that show less warmth in that period simply
   because they cover more of the planet. See the NASA website for a good
   discussion of this.

   Ultimately all of these comparisons to past records are a bit of a
   distraction. We have all the raw temperature records today, and we can
   compare them to the adjusted data to see what, exactly, adjustments do
   to the temperature record. It turns out that adjustments actually
   result in less warming over the past century, not more. If we
   scientists were “cooking the books”, then we are doing so in the wrong
   direction.


REVIEWERS’ OVERALL FEEDBACK

   These comments are the overall opinion of scientists on the article,
   they are substantiated by their knowledge in the field and by the
   content of the analysis in the annotations on the article.

   Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University:
   Firstly, as far as I can tell the report [the article is based on] is
   not published in the peer reviewed literature, yet that is the strong
   implication given. Then the central money figure is grossly misleading.
   It takes the difference between consecutive versions of the NOAA NCEI
   product and purports that these differences are the adjustments being
   applied to the raw data. I think the only phrase one could, with any
   validity, use here is “not even wrong”. Both the series have been
   adjusted, and to pretend otherwise is either showing willful ignorance
   or duplicity. Taking the difference solely shows the change in
   adjustments applied and not the total adjustments as is being implied.
   Indeed, the total common adjustments being applied to both versions of
   the NOAA NCEI product dwarf those being shown. And the biggest
   adjustment of all—and only one that really matters—is that applied to
   account for the move from bucket measurements to engine room intakes
   over the oceans in the (pre-)WW2 period. This adjustment serves to
   greatly reduce (not increase) the centennial scale surface temperature
   trend.

   Source: IPCC AR5 Fig 2.16 (The blue line—”ICOADS”—is the uncorrected
   data.)

   Finally, the finding of unequivocal warming does not rest solely upon
   surface temperature records. Rather it relies upon a broad suite of
   indicators (see e.g. FAQ2.1 of IPCC AR5) that all point unambiguously
   to the conclusion that Earth is running a fever. These findings and the
   recent surge in temperatures are corroborated by a broad range of other
   non-physical indicators (phenology, etc.) and also by a suite of modern
   reanalysis products. For so many analyses to be wrong is all but
   impossible. If the authors are correct they must explain away all these
   very many corroborating lines of evidence put together by a diverse
   range of groups using a huge range of measurements and analysis
   techniques. They can’t, and they won’t, instead preferring to cast
   doubt on small details, and making misleading assertions, all the while
   fervently hoping that their audience misses the big picture, to sow
   doubt and confusion.

   Jennifer Francis, Research Professor I, Department of Marine and
   Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University:
   The authors of this article and of the study it references clearly have
   a very limited understanding of the painstaking methods used to ensure
   that surface temperature records are based on correct and unbiased
   measurements. Temperature databases from major scientific groups
   world-wide agree with each other, and also with measurements from
   independent sources, such as satellites.

   Shaun Lovejoy, Professor, McGill University:
   The article is mostly misleading because it gives evidence (a graph)
   that does not support the interpretation that is in given in the text.
   A reader would have to be somewhat knowledgeable about global warming
   to realize that the interpretation is unjustified.

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   In a cursory attempt at both reporting and climate science, the author
   glibly highlights a document heavy on accusation and light on reasoned
   engagement with fact. Implying nefarious motives behind temperature
   measurement bias correction without providing readers any indication of
   why this is necessary is misleading and a dereliction of the author’s
   journalistic responsibility.

KEY TAKE-AWAYS

   The statements quoted below are from the article; comments and replies
   are from the reviewers.
   1. Adjustments for known issues are necessary in any dataset, but the
   adjustments made to surface temperature data have not inflated the
   long-term warming trend.

     “‘Nearly All’ Recent Global Warming Is Fabricated, Study Finds”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   The entire study could not have been more wrong in three clear ways.

   1. The adjustments are scientifically important, but rather modest for
   the global mean temperature.
   2. The adjustments make the estimated warming smaller, not larger.
   Below are, for example, the raw and adjusted warming signals of the
   NASA GISS dataset. The how and why is discussed in this post.

   3. Also without any thermometer it would be clear that the Earth is
   warming. Just look at sea ice, sea level rise, melting glaciers, later
   river freezing, earlier ice breakup, earlier spring and animal
   migration, movement of animals, plants, insects and ecosystems towards
   to poles and up mountains, etc.

     “the adjusted data”

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   It is surprising that, despite adjusted data being the crux of the
   arguments made here and in the study referred to, the author never
   explains why one may need to adjust measurements made on the ground or
   by satellites. There has been significant media coverage recently of
   some of the adjustments relating to temperature measurements made by
   satellites.

   Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what
   is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into
   orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as
   it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it
   has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be
   pulled out of orbit.

   This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite
   repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005,
   the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator
   changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local
   time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite
   measurement must be corrected for this and other effects. More details
   from this excellent article by Zeke Hausfather.

     “alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office
     differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be
     trusted.”

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   These are some of the most respected, independent and transparent
   institutions collecting and ensuring free and open access to climate
   data of the highest quality. If it were not for these agencies, our
   ability to evaluate global temperature trends at all would be in the
   stone age. It might be more useful to thank these international
   agencies for providing data with which the author makes their
   arguments.

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   The differences between the raw and the adjusted data are small for the
   global mean temperature. The warming estimated from adjusted data is
   smaller than it would have been without taking changes in the way
   observations were made into account.

     “This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the
     adjustments.”

   Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University:
   The chart provides solely a view as to the changes in applied
   adjustments between consecutive versions of one product. It does not
   reflect the totality of the adjustments being applied. Showing total
   adjustments would highlight that these deltas were dwarfed by the
   existing adjustments applied to the 2008 version. Specifically, the
   very large spurious warming resulting from biases in the raw marine
   data record over the late 1930s / early 1940s. The net effect of
   adjustments in all datasets is to reduce the centennial timescale
   warming in all the surface temperature products.

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   This chart does not show the adjustments. It shows an unsourced graph
   with the difference between two datasets. This is also due to increases
   in the amount of data used and thus also increases in coverage.

   In as far as the reason are adjustments, a likely reason would be the
   adjustments of the sea surface temperature that make global warming
   smaller. Older bucket measurements are cooler than modern buoy
   measurements because the water cools by evaporation between taking the
   bucket out of the water and reading the thermometer. In the past these
   adjustments were thought to be larger than modern estimates.

   So the “scandal” here would be that scientists were conservative in
   their early estimate of global warming.

     “The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted
     downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw
     temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.”

   Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University:
   It does no such thing as both the series are adjusted. Hence it is
   impossible from the graph as constructed to make such an inference. To
   do so would require taking the adjusted data away from the raw data
   which is not what is being done here.

   Jennifer Francis, Research Professor I, Department of Marine and
   Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University:
   Adjustments are made for good reasons. One of the most common ones is
   to account for a station located in a growing city, where the urban
   heat island effect would add spurious warming. In most cases the
   adjustments reduce, not increase, the warming in the record.

     “Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early
     twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late
     twentieth century.”

   Shaun Lovejoy, Professor, McGill University:
   Even if all the adjustments were unjustified (as the Breitbart piece
   implies), they would only change the magnitude of the overall warming
   by about 0.1 °C; from about 1 °C to about 0.9 °C. This graph is nearly
   irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic warming!

   It could also be mentioned that the 20th Century reanalysis* which uses
   NO temperature data from any stations found almost an identical warming
   (to within 0.1 °C) as 5 other series based on station data. The
   information in the Breitbart graph is irrelevant to the issue of
   anthropogenic warming; it is at most a footnote.

       without the use of station temperatures, Geophysical Research
       Letters
     * Lovejoy (2017) How accurately do we know the temperature of the
       surface of the earth?, Climate Dynamics

     “Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:

   The second world war increased the percentage of American navy vessels,
   which make engine intake measurements, and decreased the percentage of
   merchant ships, which make bucket measurements.

   Source: UK MetOffice

   Engine intake observations are typically warmer than bucket
   measurements because the water cools due to evaporation before the
   thermometer is read. That produces a spurious warm peak in the raw
   data.

     “cyclical temperature patterns”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:

   The report wants to see the summer heat waves of the Dust Bowl in
   America in the 1930s in the global average annual mean temperature.

   The figure below shows the summer temperature difference between the
   Dust Bowl year 1936 and now. The affected area, which was warmer in
   1936 than now (blue), is about 2% of the Earth’s surface.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. The document the Breitbart article relies on has not been
   peer-reviewed by scientists who work in this field.

     “The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran
     statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets[…]”

   Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University:
   As far as I can tell the linked report is not accepted for any journal
   and thus peer-reviewed is willfully misleading at best.

   Ted Letcher, Research Scientist, Cold Regions Research and Engineering
   Lab:
   In addition to not being peer reviewed, the study also doesn’t appear
   to cite ANY peer-reviewed literature to support its conclusions, nor
   does the report provide any additional references. Furthermore, the
   report appears to have a clear dismissive tone towards peer-reviewed
   research and uses dubious language such as “Climate Alarmist”, further
   straining the credibility of the report this article is based solely
   on.

   Jennifer Francis, Research Professor I, Department of Marine and
   Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University:
   If this author knew anything about the process of scientific research
   and publication, he would realize just how ridiculous this statement
   is. Note that the study reported in this article has not been published
   in any reputable peer-reviewed journal, undoubtedly because it would
   never pass muster.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3. The Breitbart article claims that we cannot say whether the Earth
   has warmed, but many lines of evidence independent from temperature
   measurements also confirm the warming trend.

     “used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the
     hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been
     dramatic and unprecedented.”

   Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University:
   The IPCC AR5 concluded that warming was unequivocal. This finding
   rested upon a wealth of evidence and not solely upon surface records.
   However, each decade for the past three decades has been warmer than
   all preceding decades in the instrumental record by a greater extent
   than quantified uncertainties. This finding applies using older or
   newer versions of the datasets.

     “Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the
     adjustments.”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   That amounts to the claim that the Earth is not really warming. Even
   without looking at any thermometer data, even if we would not have
   invented the thermometer we would know it is warming:

   Glaciers are melting, from the tropical Kilimanjaro glaciers, to the
   ones in the Alps and Greenland. Arctic sea ice is shrinking. The
   growing season in the mid-latitudes has become weeks longer. Trees bud
   and blossom earlier. Wine grapes can be harvested earlier. Animals
   migrate earlier. The habitat of plants, animals and insects is shifting
   poleward and up the mountains. Lakes and rivers freeze later and break
   up the ice earlier. The oceans are rising.

SCIENTISTS’ FEEDBACK

SUMMARY

   This story in The Atlantic by Robinson Meyer describes a new study on
   the distribution of economic impacts that result from continued climate
   change in the United States. The study finds that the impacts would not
   be uniform throughout the country, but would reduce GDP to a greater
   degree in southern states, for example, while the northernmost states
   could experience net economic benefits from warmer temperatures.

   Scientists who reviewed the article indicate that it accurately
   summarizes the study, although the topic of climate impacts is broad
   and complex, and can inevitably benefit from additional context.


REVIEWERS’ OVERALL FEEDBACK

   These comments are the overall opinion of scientists on the article,
   they are substantiated by their knowledge in the field.

   Kenneth Gillingham, Associate Professor, Yale University:
   The article is well written, engaging, and correctly described the
   findings of the Science article. It could have been more introspective
   about what the results of the Science article actually mean. (E.g. do
   the results still hold if the geographic distribution of population and
   economic activity changes in response to climate from 2012 levels? Are
   the differences between the south and north robust to a broader range
   of uncertainty than the limited uncertainty examined in the Science
   article?)

   Frances Moore, Assistant Professor, University of California Davis:
   The article accurately describes the findings of the paper it is
   discussing, which is an important scientific contribution. It points
   out the key conclusions and contributions correctly.

   Gary Yohe, Professor of Economics and Environmental Studies, Wesleyan
   University:
   The study makes an enormous contribution by updating aggregate economic
   reaction functions (sectoral and locational) across a large portion of
   the economy calibrated in currency and percentage changes in income for
   the end of the century) that will inform integrated assessment modeling
   efforts and estimates of the social cost of carbon for the United
   States.

   Even though it is not completely comprehensive (so the estimates and
   ranges continue to be lower bounds of actual totals), the estimates are
   higher than earlier numbers and ranges because the analysis covers more
   ground very carefully and digs down to county level climate risks.
   Spatial variability makes the aggregates less subject to the downward
   push of aggregating over wider areas (i.e., highs and lows do not
   cancel as much).

   Estimates of the social cost of carbon for the US should now be higher
   than before (they have persistently been orders of magnitude smaller
   than the world before now—a fact that led the EPA and the Supreme
   Court, to name two interested bodies, to use global estimates for the
   value of removing carbon emissions by, for example, raising CAFE
   standards for vehicles).

SCIENTISTS’ FEEDBACK

SUMMARY

   New York Magazine published an article by David Wallace-Wells detailing
   the potential impacts of climate change if no action is taken to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the article explores “worst case”
   scenarios of change in the climate system and the resulting impacts on
   human populations.

   Scientists reviewed the article to determine whether the descriptions
   of those scenarios accurately reflect the state of scientific
   knowledge. The New York Magazine article has triggered a number of
   responses debating the merits of the decision to focus on worst case
   scenarios, but our review simply addresses the scientific accuracy of
   the article.

   The reviewers found that some statements in this complex article do
   misrepresent research on the topic, and some others lack the necessary
   context to be clearly understood by the reader. Many other explanations
   in the article are correct, but readers are likely left with an overall
   conclusion that is exaggerated compared to our best scientific
   understanding.

   This is part of a series of reviews of 2017’s most popular climate
   stories on social media.


   UPDATE (15 July 2017): New York Magazine has published an annotated
   version of its article indicating sourcing, which also incorporates
   several edits based on scientists’ comments. Read more

   Update (13 July 2017): The analysis has been updated to include several
   comments received just after the time of publication. The main
   conclusion of the analysis is unchanged.

GUEST COMMENTS

   Michael Mann, Professor of Meteorology, PennState University:
   The article paints an overly bleak picture by overstating some of the
   science. It exaggerates for example, the near-term threat of climate
   “feedbacks” involving the release of frozen methane (the science on
   this is much more nuanced and doesn’t support the notion of a
   game-changing, planet-melting methane bomb. It is unclear that much of
   this frozen methane can be readily mobilized by projected warming).

   Also, I was struck by erroneous statements like this one referencing
   “satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice
   as fast as scientists had thought.”

   That’s just not true. The study in question simply showed that one
   particular satellite temperature dataset that had tended to show *less*
   warming that the other datasets, has now been brought in line with the
   other temperature data after some problems with that dataset were dealt
   with.

   Ironically, I am a co-author of a recent article in the journal Nature
   Geoscience (see e.g. this piece), using that very same new, corrected,
   satellite dataset, that shows that past climate model simulations
   slightly **over-predicted** the actual warming during the first decade
   of the 21st century, likely because of a mis-specification of natural
   factors like solar variations and volcanic eruptions. Once these are
   accounted for, the models and observations are pretty much in line—the
   warming of the globe is pretty much progressing AS models predicted…
   which is bad enough.

   The evidence that climate change is a serious problem that we must
   contend with now, is overwhelming on its own. There is no need to
   overstate the evidence, particularly when it feeds a paralyzing
   narrative of doom and hopelessness.


REVIEWERS’ OVERALL FEEDBACK

   These comments are the overall opinion of scientists on the article,
   they are substantiated by their knowledge in the field and by the
   content of the analysis in the annotations on the article.

   Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
   Exeter:
   While it is clear that ongoing warming of the global climate would
   eventually have very severe consequences, the concept of the Earth
   becoming uninhabitable within anywhere near the timescales suggested in
   the article is pure hyperbole. The author has clearly done very
   extensive research and addresses a number of climate threats that are
   indeed major issues, but generally the narrative ramps up the threat to
   go beyond the level that is supported by science.

   Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center
   for Atmospheric Research:
   This is an unusual piece in that it accurately describes some of the
   most dire consequences of unabated global warming but focuses almost
   exclusively on worst case scenarios. In doing so, it provides a
   compelling narrative of what could happen in the future, but does not
   accurately characterize the likelihood of particular outcomes relative
   to what is justifiable based upon existing scientific evidence.

   Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab:
   The article, while it does thoughtfully discuss some serious
   implications of climate change, also goes beyond the evidence in a
   number of instances of its exploration of worst-case scenarios.

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   This article focuses on the high-end scenario for global warming—high
   emissions and/or high climate sensitivity, high impacts. It selects
   recent research that highlights these outcomes. I am sympathetic to the
   author’s efforts to raise awareness about such scenarios, including
   impacts that are not always well discussed, and agree that we tend to
   focus too much on median outcomes. Nevertheless, I think the article
   would have gained from a more explicit acknowledgement that this
   particular focus is the goal of the article, as well as a from an
   explicit discussion (even if only qualitative) of the probabilities
   associated with these scenarios. Absent that, I am afraid the article,
   as such, feels misleading, or at least confusing for the general
   public.

   In addition, the article contains a number of claims that are factually
   wrong, and a number of claims that are, to my knowledge, not
   substantiated by research.

   I was also concerned by the implied claim that this article, being
   written after interviews with many climate scientists, somehow reflects
   scientists’ true opinion about global warming. I don’t believe it does.

   What this article suggest to me is that we, as as community of
   scientists and science journalists, need to find a better way to more
   accurately discuss climate change projections and to convey the
   associated risks to the public.

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   In what seems an ode to new journalism, the author takes significant
   literary license to leverage information grounded in truth and paint an
   apocalyptic picture of extreme future scenarios possibly driven by
   anthropogenic climate change. Ambiguous references to studies, events
   and examples severely impairs credibility, as does a complete disregard
   for nuance.

   Christopher Colose, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, NASA GISS:
   There are many arguments in this article at the interface of climate
   instability, socio-political disruption, and general global security.
   They are, however, clumsily wrapped together and doesn’t reflect well
   the actual risk posed by climate change.

   A general comment concerning the climate response to future carbon
   emissions—one of the emergent insights from decades of research is that
   linearity is too powerful of a tool to be abandoned lightly. In this
   context, it is better to think of future warming as smoothly monotonic
   in our total carbon emissions rather than behaving erratically due to
   significant non-linearities in the system.

   There is no evidence that a very abrupt methane source(s) will be
   readily mobilized into the atmosphere. Such scenarios are not supported
   by process studies, it is not emerging observationally, and is not
   borne out paleoclimatically (particularly in the mid-Holocene or Eemian
   interglacial, where high latitude summers were hotter than today). A
   small trickle of CH[4] release is very plausible, but methane becomes
   converted to CO[2] pretty quickly in Earth’s atmosphere, and there’s
   already some 200 times more CO[2] in the air than CH[4]. These types of
   carbon cycle feedbacks will likely give the direct anthropogenic carbon
   input just a small boost in the near future.

   Similarly, it’s not obvious that there are any significantly missing
   feedbacks that should radically alter the linear perspective
   (certainly, any under-representation of surface albedo feedbacks in
   current models are unlikely to be the difference maker, since the polar
   regions make up a very small percentage of the globe and the surface
   contribution to the planetary albedo is somewhat masked by clouds).

   A Younger Dryas event today would likely be quite disruptive (the
   global mean temperature changes were quite modest, but the
   extratropical temperature re-organizations would still be significant);
   however, the processes leading to an event like this are pretty unique
   to a glacial climate undergoing melting, and is unlikely to occur in a
   warming world during our present interglacial.

   Actual numbers are important here. The global temperature increase
   could indeed reach 4-5 degrees by 2100, if humans don’t do anything to
   our emissions, and beyond this patches of uninhabitable areas (for
   humans) could start to open up in the tropics, due to heat stress
   limits imposed by the evaporative limits of our body. Indeed, a world
   5+ degrees warmer is a big cause for alarm, even if the world takes a
   linear path to that mark. The world also does not end in 2100, and
   while it is tempting to think of later dates as “very far off,” it is
   worth reminding ourselves that we would live on a different planet had
   people of the Viking era industrialized and emitted carbon
   uncontrollably.

   Nonetheless, the near future climatic fate of New York probably looks
   more like the climate of South Carolina or Georgia than something from
   a Mad Max movie. This is still an important basis for concern given
   that the socio-political infrastructure that exists around the world is
   biased toward the modern climate.

   Many of the nightmare scenarios in this article, such as no more food,
   unbreathable air, poisoned oceans, perpetual warfare, etc. are simply
   ridiculous, although food security is indeed an issue at stake (see
   David Battisti’s comments). A “business-as-usual” climate in 1-2
   centuries still looks markedly different than the current one, but
   there’s no reason yet to think much of the world will become
   uninhabitable or look like a science fiction novel.

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   We are taking the climate system out of known territories. There will
   be many surprises and they are what worry me the most. Uncertainty is
   not our friend and that makes it very hard to say which worst case
   scenarios are unrealistic.

   The bigger the stakes the smaller the acceptable risks. A risk someone
   may be willing to take personally will be larger than the risk one
   takes with a community, a country or civilization.

   In that respect it is good that the article explores what surprises may
   be in store and talks about scenarios that are not likely, but a large
   part of the total risk.

   However, unfortunately often statements are inaccurate, wrong or are
   missing important context. These inaccuracies tend to exaggerate the
   risks of climate change.

   Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab:
   The article, while it does thoughtfully discuss some serious
   implications of climate change, also goes beyond the evidence in a
   number of instances of its exploration of worst-case scenarios.

   Benjamin Horton, Professor, Earth Observatory of Singapore:
   Most statements in the article are based on peer-reviewed literature.

   Pierre Friedlingstein, Professor, University of Exeter:
   The article is very alarmist, making very strong statements with very
   little (if any) support. Implying that climate scientists support the
   article, which I find hard to believe.
   Such article does not help at all. It’s just too easy to prove it wrong
   and hence imply that the entire climate change issue is exaggerated.

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   I do not disagree with the tone of the article in the way that most
   folks here seem to, and I think it does a service to highlight recent
   results and ideas throughout the scientific community. However there
   are inaccurate statements, like about satellite warming since 1998,
   unsupported conclusions or implications (about past mass extinctions,
   air chemistry, maybe arctic methane). But I feel that the overall
   thrust of the article is not wrong, wildly misleading, or out of bounds
   of the discussion we should be having about climate change.

KEY TAKE-AWAYS

   The statements quoted below are from the article; comments and replies
   are from the reviewers.
   1. The article attempts to describe a worst case scenario for future
   warming.

     “The Uninhabitable Earth”

   Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center
   for Atmospheric Research:
   The title itself is hyperbolic—there’s not really a plausible climate
   change scenario in which the Earth becomes truly uninhabitable. That’s
   not to downplay the very real and very large threat to human lives,
   economies, infrastructure, ecosystems, and species—and the author does
   a good job cataloging many of these later in the piece. But taken
   literally, the title implies a future bleaker than is warranted by
   existing scientific evidence.

     “Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change
     could wreak — sooner than you think.”

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   This is well-researched and on target. Unfortunately.

     “Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of
     life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly
     transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an
     unbreathable gas”

   Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
   Exeter:
   There’s been a lot written about this recently, following the BBC’s
   publicising of Stephen Hawking’s remarks on it.  I don’t think it is
   accurate to say that Venus was “once a very Earth-like planet” and
   hence imply that the runaway greenhouse effect could happen here. For
   one thing, Venus is much closer to the sun. A runaway greenhouse effect
   on Earth is not thought to be a plausible threat.

   Ted Letcher, Research Scientist, Cold Regions Research and Engineering
   Lab:
   My expertise is not in exoplanetary climate, but it is not a
   definitively accepted “fact” that Venus was once habitable. There is
   still considerable debate regarding the past habitability of Venus (see
   links below). Therefore, this statement (which appears to imply that
   Venus’s climate trajectory is foreshadowing for Earth’s) comes off way
   too strong.

       system?, Geophysical Research Letters

       knowledge and future exploration, Planetary and Space Science

     “parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:

   I am not sure how one defines habitability. Paucity of resources (e.g.,
   water, vegetation) does not necessarily make a region uninhabitable. So
   I think that strictly speaking, the author is referring here to studies
   showing that the combination of heat+humidity may exceed a threshold
   for human survival some part of the year in already-very-hot-an-humid
   parts of Southwest Asia (around the Gulf of Persia) by the end of the
   century^1.

   To my knowledge this kind of result hasn’t been shown for other
   regions, so in that context, the sentence “parts of”, while technically
   correct, may imply more than has been established.

   Note, however, that even without exceeding survival limits, humid heat
   increases would have impacts on outdoor activities^2.

     “there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite
     data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast
     as scientists had thought”

   Carl Mears, Senior Research Scientist, Remote Sensing Systems (RSS):
   This sentence is true for RSS data, but it’s somewhat misleading due to
   lack of context. If you look at the two most recent versions of the RSS
   data and compute linear trends Jan 1998-Dec 2016, you find that the new
   version has a trend value for this period of about 2.6 times larger
   than the previous version. But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a
   favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived
   threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative
   maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus
   trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in
   other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between
   datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears
   quite large. However, if one calculated the trends for Jan 1999-Dec
   2016 instead, the trends increases by a factor of about 1.6, not 2.6,
   only a 60% increase. Of course this is still a pretty large increase.

   The sentence also ignores the other sources of lower-tropospheric
   satellite data. The newer version of the UAH (Version 6.0) data shows
   less warming than the previous version. Also, the radiosonde datasets
   show more warming over this period that any of the satellite datasets
   (except maybe UAH V5.6), and have done so for years.

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   If anything, satellite measurements of lower atmospheric temperatures
   (which is what the author is talking about here, not near-surface,
   2-meter temperature), show slightly less warming than predicted by
   models, a discrepancy that is a topic of ongoing research*.
     * Santer et al (2017) Causes of differences in model and satellite
       tropospheric warming rates, Nature Geoscience

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   I would like to add that this “twice as fast” is just for a
   cherry-picked period. That is about as bad as mitigation sceptics
   claiming that global warming has stopped by cherry picking a specific
   period.

   The real message was that satellite upper air warming estimates are
   unreliable (still are), but seem to confirm what we know from the
   surface warming.

   This story was thus not alarming. If anything is was good news, it
   reduces uncertainties and as this uninhabitable-article already
   suggests: uncertainty is not our friend.

     “Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice
     shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has
     just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already
     have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the
     biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’”

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   Although a particularly dramatic and well-observed example of how
   floating ice shelves calve icebergs into the ocean, there is little
   evidence that the crack in the Larsen C ice shelf is directly related
   to climate change. At best this is subject to considerable debate, as
   it is difficult to directly connect particular atmospheric and oceanic
   mechanisms to the cracking of this single, albeit large, proto-iceberg.

   For a very measured treatment of this topic, see the Guardian article
   by Professor Helen Fricker of Scripps Institute of Oceanography.

   Having now just calved an iceberg as of July 12, it is good to hear
   from the most experience experts how concerning this event is. A really
   great simple summary is provided by David Vaughan, Director of Science
   for the British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on the Antarctic
   Peninsula and studied regional ice shelves for decades.

     “But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed
     enough”

   Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center
   for Atmospheric Research:
   It is quantitatively true—and often under-appreciated—that the
   likelihood of a “worse than expected” climate future is actually higher
   than a “better than expected” one. That is: the distribution of climate
   outcomes is not symmetrical, and as others have previously pointed out,
   “uncertainty is not our friend“.

     “This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges
     with climatologists and researchers in related fields”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   This sentence implies, somehow, that the scientific content of this
   article comes from these scientists, or that they agree with it. I
   don’t believe that this is entirely the case—e.g. see Michael Mann’s
   comments—and, the author should have mentioned that as a caveat here.

     “and we will need to have invented technologies to extract,
     annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire
     planet’s plants now do”

   Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab:
   Its unclear in this statement, about the relative amount of negative
   emissions needed versus the amount of carbon extracted by plants,
   whether the author means the total amount of photosynthesis by plants
   (which would be a false statement) or the total difference between
   photosynthesis, respiration, and disturbance (which would be a true
   statement). Plants photosynthesize about 120 petagrams of carbon per
   year, whereas the net land sink is more like 2-3 petagrams of carbon
   per year. It is the latter number that is comparable in magnitude to
   the negative emissions technologies required.

     “at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of
     the century”

   Benjamin Horton, Professor, Earth Observatory of Singapore:
   This statement is supported by peer-reviewed literature. 20th and 21st
   century rates of relative sea-level rise varied from -4 mm/yr to 3
   mm/yr, and are dwarfed by potential future rates of 21st century rise,
   which under high forcing and unfavorable ice sheet dynamics could
   exceed 2 meters (i.e., a century-average rate of 20 mm/yr) in many
   locations.

     “Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of
     surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose
     them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the
     next decade.”

   Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
   Exeter:
   These places are clearly at high risk of more frequent coastal
   flooding, but suggesting that we will “lose them within a century” is
   an exaggeration. Although there are substantial threats of flooding
   events, much of the country is not actually at risk of permanent
   indundation this century. Scientists and policymakers in Bangladesh are
   well aware of the threat of rising sea levels and are actively involved
   in research and planning on this, and this includes a strong focus on
   adaptation (as well as on making the case for reducing the threat
   through mitigation). They point to the example of the Netherlands to
   show that low-lying countries can adapt and even reclaim land from the
   sea.  Of course this won’t be possible everywhere, especially in
   wilderness areas such as the Sundarbans which would be impacted by such
   measures themselves, but talk of the entire country “not surviving” is
   not a fair reflection of the scientific analysis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. Some types of extreme weather conditions, like heatwaves, are
   expected to increase with future warming. The response of other
   specific types of weather, such as tornadoes, remains uncertain.

     “This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than
     normal baked the North Pole”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
   Regions with open water will stay relatively warm due to the relatively
   warm water. As soon as ice limits heat flows from the ocean to the
   atmosphere it can get very cold. Also, in general variability is much
   stronger in the Arctic—what sounds like a really big warm anomaly to an
   innocent reader in the USA is thus exceptional, but less so than the
   numbers suggest. That is context a reader would need to know.
     * Steffensen et al (2008) High-Resolution Greenland Ice Core Data
       Show Abrupt Climate Change Happens in Few Years, Science

     “Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like
     Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually
     encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in
     2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which
     killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At
     six[…] summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower
     Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies
     would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world
     today[…].”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   “At two degrees… at four… at six” What is missing here is a discussion
   of the probabilities of each target, depending on emission scenarios,
   etc… It’s fine to discuss high-end scenarios, but mentioning
   probabilities would add context—without deterring from discussing the
   extreme risks associated, I believe.

   In general, the language in this paragraph is dire, but, in my opinion,
   this is an underappreciated consequence of global warming, and the
   author does well to highlight it.

   It’s difficult to extrapolate future impacts from one-time events: the
   2003 heatwave killed that many people in Europe because it was so far
   out from the usual distribution, and populations were poorly prepared.
   In a warmer future, preparedness and reactivity would arguably be
   improved, so impacts could be reduced.

   Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington:
   The article highlights worst case projections of the intensity of
   heatwaves, but not of their frequency. Projections indicate return
   periods of high-mortality heatwaves will shorten over the century and,
   in some cases, the length of these high-mortality heatwaves will
   increase.  That does not mean these events will occur every day during
   a summer. In many regions, this means a high-mortality heatwave could
   occur could approach becoming an annual event instead of rarely.
   Further, the projections do not take into account that increased
   heat-related hazards are only one factor that influences future risks.
   The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the
   exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to
   prepare for and manage heatwaves. There is growing literature that
   sensitivity to heatwaves has declined over recent decades, presumably
   because of some degree of acclimatization to ever higher temperatures,
   increasing access to air conditioning and cooling centers, better
   understanding and communication of the risks of high ambient
   temperatures, and changing infrastructure to reduce urban heat
   islands.  Recent projections using different approaches that take these
   changes into account show that taking these factors into account
   decreases the magnitude of risks.

     “unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced”

   Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
   Exeter:
   Actually, overall the general projection is for the world to be wetter
   on average, with increasing drought in some regions but decreases in
   others, and increased annual rainfall in many places. The projections
   are extremely uncertain though, so while it is probably possible to
   cherry-pick model simulations that suggest increased drought in almost
   any region (and hence argue, probably fairly, that most places do have
   some increased risk of drought) these would not be expected to happen
   concurrently everywhere. A scenario with increased drought in one
   region would generally see a decrease elsewhere.

     “a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and
     floods and droughts”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   Not to nitpick—we don’t really know what a +6 °C world would look like
   in detail—but the connection between tornadoes and warming is unclear,
   at least in the observable record.

   Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center
   for Atmospheric Research:
   While there is still some uncertainty regarding the response of
   tropical cyclones (i.e. typhoons and hurricanes) to global warming,
   there is now evidence that frequency in many ocean basins may actually
   decrease, but maximum intensity will likely increase.

   There is indeed evidence that the frequency and intensity of
   floods/droughts is increasing over much of the globe*, and will
   continue to do so as the climate warms. This is not necessarily true
   universally–there will still be quite a bit of spatial and temporal
   diversity in the response of precipitation extremes to global warming,
   even in a six-degree-warmer world. But in general, it’s true that there
   will be dramatically more flood and drought events on a global basis

   3. Feedbacks like the release of greenhouse gases from warming
   landscapes can amplify warming trends, but these processes appear
   overstated in the article.

     “In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as
     much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet,
     all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting
     moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming
     power 86 times over.”

   Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab:
   Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in
   degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and
   as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback
   projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor
   pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at
   least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the
   carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems
   emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently
   photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most
   of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as
   either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane.
   So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw
   is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to
   be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane.

   A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric
   called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the
   mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of
   carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a
   molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take
   into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much
   heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the
   transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would
   acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you
   have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight
   of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34
   and 86 ought to read 12 and 31. This is a separate issue from the
   timescale one that others point out, and which further makes this
   comparison misleading.

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   It would be wrong to say, as I often read in the popular press, that
   all or most of the frozen permafrost carbon will come out as methane,
   or that Arctic methane will have much impact on climate evolution in
   the near future. But this article doesn’t exactly say that. Carbon
   released from permafrost that eventually reaches the atmosphere as
   CO[2]could significantly add to the “long tail” climate impacts from
   CO[2]. And this is a much more certain outcome than from methane.

   The factor of 86 however is totally misleading about the impact of
   methane vs. CO[2]. This is an instantaneous impact on radiative forcing
   (a high-end one at that), and doesn’t reflect the longevity of CO[2]
   (long enough to melt ice sheets) vs. methane (which, emitted now, will
   mostly be CO[2] by the time of peak temperature, say, optimistically,
   2050).

   Vasilii Petrenko, Assistant Professor, University of Rochester:
   This is incorrect.

   First, to the best of my knowledge, there currently is not a strong
   consensus about whether thawing permafrost areas would be a net carbon
   sink or source. If the only process is that the permafrost carbon is
   respired by microbes and released to the atmosphere, then there is
   indeed a large carbon source. However, permafrost areas currently are
   mostly tundra or tundra-boreal forest biomes, which have relatively low
   biomass carbon stores. With warming, there would be more forest
   expansion into formerly permafrost areas, which may compensate for the
   respiration of permafrost carbon.

   Second, with regard to large-scale methane release from thawing
   permafrost, currently available science indicates that this is
   unlikely. First, despite the ongoing Arctic warming, there is no
   evidence (from precise atmospheric measurements of methane) that Arctic
   methane emissions are increasing. Second, an ice core study that I led
   a number of years ago* indicated that “old” carbon sources (carbon
   sources depleted in the radioactive carbon–14 isotope) did not play a
   large role in a rapid methane increase that was associated with a
   period of warming 11,600 years ago. Permafrost carbon is old and
   relatively low in carbon–14 content. That warming provides a partial
   analog to what is happening today. While we can’t with 100% certainty
   rule out the possibility of large methane emissions from thawing
   permafrost in the future, the scientific data available to date
   indicate that the probability of such emissions is low.
     * Petrenko et al (2009) ^14CH[4] Measurements in Greenland Ice:
       Investigating Last Glacial Termination CH[4] Sources, Science

   Peter Neff, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Washington:
   The author’s facts about methane are generally accurate, but he amps up
   concern about catastrophic release of methane from permafrost beyond
   what evidence supports. Scientists also investigate whether methane
   frozen at the seafloor of some continental shelves can be
   catastrophically be released to the atmosphere.

   However, existing evidence suggests that natural processes prevent
   catastrophe. Marine methane (gas hydrates) are heavily processed in the
   water column, and no contribution to the atmosphere has yet been
   observed. See an excellent review by Carolyn Ruppel of the US
   Geological Survey and John Kessler of the University of Rochester*,
   which was also summarized in the popular press.
     * Ruppel and Kessler (2017) The interaction of climate change and
       methane hydrates, Reviews of Geophysics

     “The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect
     (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence
     more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback
     of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the
     atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming”

   Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab:
   This statement is a mixture of true and false claims.

   Physical feedbacks like albedo and cloud cover are most definitely
   included in Earth system models (ESMs) that are used to make future
   climate projections, so while the phrase “fully account for” isn’t well
   defined, the statement as written seems incorrect.

   As of the 5th IPCC report, biogeochemical feedbacks from permafrost
   were not explicitly taken into account in fully-coupled ESM
   simulations. However, some simulations to quantify permafrost CO2 and
   CH4 feedbacks had been done as of that time and reported in the
   assessment text, and since then these types of studies have been
   expanded. The central estimate of the additional contribution of
   warming from these permafrost feedback processes is on the order of
   about 20 Pg C released per degree celsius global mean temperature
   change—or in physical terms about 0.1 watts per meter squared per
   degree Celsius—which is an important contribution to warming but likely
   less catastrophic than presented here. However, the uncertainty on
   these projections does remain high and I don’t think we can completely
   exclude the possibility of more serious permafrost-driven feedbacks
   yet.

   Feedbacks arising from forest dieback is something that is included in
   some but not all ESMs used to make climate projections (i.e., those
   that have a “dynamic vegetation” component as opposed to a static,
   prescribed biogeography). Most carbon cycle models used in ESMs for
   climate assessments have extremely simplified treatment of forest
   mortality processes but, some do try to resolve this process, so while
   the uncertainty due to this process is extremely high and poorly
   captured in current ESM-based projections, it is not correct to say
   that it is not accounted for at all.

   Also, the text implies that all feedback processes are positive,
   destabilizing feedbacks, which isn’t the case. There are also numerous
   negative, stabilizing feedbacks, that exist in the planet and that are
   also captured to various degrees in our models of the planet. As with
   the positive feedbacks, the uncertainty on these is large and most
   likely it is poorly captured by the current generation of ESMs.

   Ted Letcher, Research Scientist, Cold Regions Research and Engineering
   Lab:
   “More cloud cover (which traps heat)” is a gross over-simplification
   regarding the role of clouds as a tuning knob for Earth’s climate.
   While it is true that clouds can act as a blanket and trap more heat,
   they also serve to reflect sunlight (see the prior sentence regarding
   the albedo effect).

   Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical
   thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough
   approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will
   act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore
   radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin. Conversely,
   lower clouds act more as a reflector since they are warmer and
   optically thick.

   The IPCC report does generally show a net positive cloud feedback,
   indicating global cloud feedbacks will lead to additional warming, but
   cloud feedbacks are extremely complicated and highly uncertain.

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   I am not sure what the author means here. The climate models whose
   projections the IPCC reports are based on definitely account for the
   changes in albedo from reduced sea-ice and snow cover as the world
   warms (although not necessarily changes in glaciers and ice caps
   extents—e.g. Greenland—which is maybe what the author means here), as
   well as the effect of changes in clouds (actually, the largest source
   of uncertainty in climate models projections); most models also now
   account for changes in vegetation and include an interactive carbon
   cycle (for instance, how a reduction in forest diminishes the land
   carbon sink).

   4. Climate change in Earth’s past can be used to understand the
   workings of the climate system and refine our expectations for the
   long-term impacts of modern warming.

     “In fact, all but the one [extinction event] that killed the
     dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas.
     The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon
     warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming
     triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97
     percent of all life on Earth dead.”

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   Other agents of destruction have been invoked for the end Permian
   extinction, involving toxic fluorine fumes from volcanic emissions or
   sulfides from the deep sea.

   Lee Kump, Professor, PennState University:
   Climate change accompanies all of the mass extinctions, although severe
   warming isn’t necessarily always to blame. For example, the extinction
   at the end of the Ordovician occurred during a brief, enigmatic
   glaciation.

   The “notorious” extinction 242 million years ago, at the end of the
   Permian, clearly (based on oxygen isotope proxy data) was accompanied
   by significant global warming likely triggered by the eruption of the
   “Siberian Traps” volcanoes, with concomitant buildup of carbon dioxide.
   Whether methane was released remains speculative, although not
   unlikely. The species extinction percentage in the ocean could have
   approached 97%, the proportion was likely lower on land.

     “the geological record shows that temperature can shift as much as
     ten degrees or more in a single decade”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   I am not sure, again, what the author is referring to here. Ice cores
   have shown that Greenland temperatures can swing by as much as 10 °C
   during glacial-interglacial transition*, yes, but we are not talking
   about global mean temperature here, more about swift reorganization of
   atmospheric circulation in interglacial glacial transitions that leads
   to strong regional change in the Arctic. I am unaware of studies
   showing past global-scale warming of 10 °C in a decade.

   Note, however, that even global warming of a few degrees C in a century
   or two would be extremely fast, by geological standards.

     “The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter
     Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the
     planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet
     higher.”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   I don’t know what time period the author is referring to here, but
   closer to us, during the last interglacial (roughly 120,000 years ago),
   Earth was ~2 °C warmer than temperatures in the 19th century, and sea
   levels were about 5-6 meters higher. This suggests that even
   “good-case, 2 °C” long-term warming in our future could also raise
   oceans by that much eventually, even if the pace of that rise (and thus
   the amount of rise by 2100) is uncertain.

     “Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though
     models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually.”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   This brings up an important point: while historically, IPCC-type
   projections stop in 2100 by convention, warming does not stop then, in
   particular for very high (perhaps implausibly high) greenhouse gas
   emission scenarios: warming goes on in the following centuries, up to
   ten of degrees in the worst case.

   Note that the larger the warming, the larger the uncertainties between
   climate models (the shading).

   5. Warming and drought will negatively impact agriculture—varying with
   the crop and the region.

     “The end of food”

   Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
   Exeter:
   This is hyperbole. Yes there are threats to crop production and other
   aspects of food security, but the scientific analyses do not suggest an
   actual “end of food”—it is more a case of regional winners and losers.
   Not all current food-producing regions are projected to lose their
   productivity. A redistribution of production would still still be a
   major issue that society will need to deal with, and may well require
   growing crops in new places, but this is not the same as suggesting
   that food supplies will completely come to an end.

     “the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature
     is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent.
     Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means
     that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century,
     we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent
     less grain to give them.”

   David Battisti, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
   Washington:
   These numbers stem from the results of controlled field sites (in, for
   example, the Philippines, India and Mexico) and refer to the impact of
   local temperature changes on yield, all else being equal. (Also, note
   that the major grain producing regions are in the midlatitudes, where
   the projected temperature increases are substantially greater than the
   projected global average temperature increase.)

   The projected changes in precipitation are sufficiently uncertain that
   it is not possible to quantitatively account for the impact of their
   changes, although the IPCC 2013 WG1 Report concludes: “In many
   mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will
   likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean
   precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.” (In IPCC
   lingo, “likely” is greater than 2/3 chance.)

   Finally, there is also a fertilization effect associated with
   increasing CO[2], although studies have shown that the deleterious
   impact of increasing temperature far outweigh the impact of increased
   CO[2].

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   Well, for one thing, if food supplies decrease by 50%, one could argue
   that it is unlikely population would increase by 50% in the meantime…
   More to the point, the back-of-the-envelope calculation from the
   author, here, implies that all crops are grown at optimal temperature,
   which they are not.

   Exact, global impacts of global warming on agriculture are difficult to
   quantify. One must also account for the effect of increased atmospheric
   CO[2] on plant photosynthesis, as well as precipitation changes, which
   are uncertain in particular over land in the Tropics. Adaptation and
   management could also influence changes a lot. Generally, the estimate
   has been that warming would be neutral for mid-and high latitudes, up
   to a point, while being detrimental to agriculture in low latitudes.
   But again, global, quantitative impacts are uncertain, especially for
   large warming. I haven’t seen studies suggesting a global decrease by
   50%.

     “as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has
     shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain,
     and those places where grain is produced today are already at
     optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will
     push them down the slope of declining productivity.”

   David Battisti, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
   Washington:
   This statement is mostly accurate. To be more precise, it would read
   “Temperature in the tropics is already greater than the optimal
   temperature for growing the major crops (rice, wheat, maize). Most of
   the major grain-producing regions of the world are in the midlatitudes
   (e.g. the US, Europe, Ukraine, China), where today growing season
   temperatures are nearly optimal. Hence, warming due to increased CO[2]
   will indeed decrease the yield of these crops in these high-producing
   regions.”

     “with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to
     desert”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   What regions? Is this a statement about the present, or the future?

   If about the present, I am unaware of major arable land regions
   currently facing desertification.

   Current drought trends—whether droughts, on the global scale, are
   increasing in extent and/or severity—and their future under global
   warming, is still somewhat uncertain and a topic of ongoing research.

     “Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for
     later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts
     nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic
     reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent
     extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was.
     The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the
     Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia,
     Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China.”

   David Battisti, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
   Washington:
   In general, there is large uncertainty in how precipitation will change
   due to increased greenhouse gases, including the Sahel in Africa,
   Australia, and many of important grain producing regions of the world
   (e.g., the US, Ukraine, China). Under high emission scenarios, models
   consistently project annual averaged drying in a few places by the end
   of the Century: e.g. southern Europe, northern Africa, and southern
   Africa. The IPCC 2013 WG1 Report concludes: “In many mid-latitude and
   subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while
   in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely
   increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.” (In IPCC lingo, “likely” is
   greater than 2/3 chance.)

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   This is not true for precipitation. See the right panel on the plot
   below:

   What the author is probably referring to is drought projections not
   based on precipitation alone, but rainfall+temperature, as shown for
   instance by the Palmer Drought Index.

   However, there is a debate as to how best to interpret such projections
   in terms, for instance, of impacts on vegetation (and crop yields) or
   water resources*.

   So I would argue things are more uncertain than the authors implies
   here.
     * Milly and Dunne (2016) Potential evapotranspiration and continental
       drying, Nature Climate Change

   Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center
   for Atmospheric Research:
   I agree with Alexis Berg’s comment above. Projections regarding
   widespread occurrence of historically unprecedented drought are in most
   cases the product of very strong warming that overwhelms any changes
   (positive or negative) in precipitation in terms of net moisture.
   Obviously, temperature-driven droughts will still have large and
   adverse consequences for agriculture in many regions—so the broader
   point made here regarding large risks to food production is reasonable.

     “None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food,
     will be reliable sources of any.”

   David Battisti, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
   Washington:
   Even with no change in the natural variability in growing season
   temperature, increasing summer averaged temperature will likely lead to
   increased volatility in grain production in the midlatitudes because of
   the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. See section
   7.4 of the IPCC 2013 WG2 Report for a recent summary.

   Africa and “Iraq, Syria and much of the Middle East” are not on the
   list of the world’s major grain producer regions.

     “In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the
     population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of
     the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields
     they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades
     ago.”

   Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:

   If this author already writes “presumed result”, I would love to see a
   reference to the scientific literature. It would be quite surprising if
   the 1-1.5 °C warming we have seen up now makes such a differences.

   6. Air quality can be affected by both emissions of pollutants and by
   weather patterns that contribute to urban smog, for example. Climate
   change can also affect disease transmission by altering the conditions
   required by vectors.

     “The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by
     mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in
     unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research
     has projected.”

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   Note that ozone concentrations are also determined by emissions of
   NO[x]and hydrocarbons, which can be controlled.

     “[Carbon dioxide] just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end
     estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit
     1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we
     breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   There is, indeed, some research showing impairments in cognitive
   function test scores in people exposed to CO2 concentrations in the
   950-1,000 ppm range, and even significantly worse performance when
   CO[2]gets to 1,500 and 2,500 ppm. But note that concentrations greater
   than ~1,000 ppm are, already today, often found in poorly ventilated
   rooms and buildings.

   At even higher concentrations, documented metabolic and health effects
   start to appear—in fact, the safe limit for permanent, long-term
   exposure to higher concentration of CO[2] does not appear to be well
   known. It seems like NASA and the Navy set that limit around 5,000 ppm
   for their crews in submarines and spacecrafts.

     “That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent
     of our oxygen.”

   Alexis Berg, Associate Research Scholar, Princeton University:
   This sentence somehow implies that deforesting the Amazon would reduce
   atmospheric oxygen by 20%. This is not true.

   To quote Wally Broecker, who is cited later in the article: “Simply
   put, our atmosphere is endowed with such an enormous reserve of this
   gas that even if we were to burn all our fossil fuel reserves, all our
   trees, and all the organic matter stored in soils, we would use up only
   a few percent of the available O[2]. No matter how foolishly we treat
   our environmental heritage, we simply don’t have the capacity to put
   more than a small dent in our O[2] supply. Furthermore, the Earth’s
   forests do not play a dominant role in maintaining O[2] reserves,
   because they consume just as much of this gas as they produce. In the
   tropics, ants, termites, bacteria, and fungi eat nearly the entire
   photosynthetic O[2] product. Only a tiny fraction of the organic matter
   they produce accumulates in swamps and soils or is carried down the
   rivers for burial on the sea floor.”



     “The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In
     Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918
     flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100
     million”

   Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington:
   A series of cholera pandemics and 1918 Spanish influenza were global
   pandemics causing high mortality long before anthropogenic climate
   change began influencing the geographic range of climate-sensitive
   health outcomes.  The World Health Organization and national health
   systems are preparing for changes in the intensity of transmission,
   geographic range, and seasonality of climate-sensitive infectious
   diseases.  Certainly much more needs to be done, but the article
   implies national and International public health organizations and
   institutions will not take action when diseases emerge or re-emerge.
   This is not consistent with the responses to Ebola, Zika, and other
   recent events.

     ” You don’t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in
     Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes
     migrate with them, you will.”

   Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington:
   The statement about the malaria incidence of malaria doesn’t mention
   the significant decline in the number of cases over the past several
   decades based on concerted public health efforts. Continuing and
   scaling up those programs would protect future populations from any
   changes in disease incidence associated with climate change.

     “As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying
     effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika
     until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is
     that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects.”

   Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington:
   It would be helpful to know the source of the statements about Zika.
   Zika was first recognized in Uganda, but has not been trapped there.
   Zika has been moving around the world for the past few years,
   presumably associated with trade and travel. With limited surveillance
   of Zika and with limited numbers of cases, it isn’t possible to say
   whether the disease caused birth defects before the large outbreak
   last year; research is underway to determine that.

   7. The ocean are affected not just by rising temperatures, but by
   changes in chemistry caused by higher concentration of carbon dioxide
   in the atmosphere.

     “That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption
     can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed
     different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,”
     first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the
     surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers,
     choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite
     advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where
     hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile
     stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’”

   Lee Kump, Professor, PennState University:
   Ocean acidification per se doesn’t enhance anoxia: anoxia (loss of
   oxygen) results from warming (warm water holds less dissolved gas like
   oxygen), which would be the consequence of atmospheric CO[2] buildup,
   as might more sluggish ocean mixing. It also is enhanced by increased
   nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land
   under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the
   uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and
   thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became
   warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is
   exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds
   including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia
   does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such
   conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia
   of warming and eutrophication have occurred. Hydrogen sulfide likely
   contributed to the mass extinction, but the warming itself as well as
   other volcanic emanations like chlorine, fluorine, and sulfur dioxide
   were equally if not more important drivers of the extinction. The
   recovery from the extinction did take millions of years.

     “they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle
     to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as
     much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces
     seizures, comas, and sudden death.”

   David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago:
   Human blood chemistry is regulated in a way the sea water is not, so
   this statement is only marginally relevant.

UPDATE (15 July 2017):

   Here is the list of statements that have been modified from the
   original version of the New York Magazine article:

   – added: “To read an annotated version of this article, complete with
   interviews with scientists and links to further reading, click here.”

   – modified:

   “[DEL: there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s
   satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice
   as fast as scientists had thought. :DEL] ”

   now reads:
   “there are alarming stories in the news every day, like those, last
   month, that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming
   since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought (in fact,
   the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the
   headlines).”

   – modified:

   “[DEL: the geological record shows that temperature can shift as much
   as ten degrees or more in a single decade. :DEL] ”

   now reads:
   “the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as
   five degrees Celsius within thirteen years.”

   – added: “This article has been updated to provide context for the
   recent news reports about revisions to a satellite data set, to more
   accurately reflect the rate of warming during the Paleocene–Eocene
   Thermal Maximum […]”
