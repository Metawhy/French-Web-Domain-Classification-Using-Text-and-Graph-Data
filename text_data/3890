   Works with Zendesk

     * Complete WFM solution
       Time & attendance, performance monitoring, scheduling and adherence
       all rolled into one beautiful package.
     * Gain immediate insight
       Real-time dashboards let you see your team’s activity across every
       channel providing you with immediate insight and transparency.
     * Virtually no setup
       Tymeshift is built from the ground up for Zendesk which means
       you’ll never have to manage your config in two places again.

Everything you need

   Our software helps companies schedule, track, monitor and find trends
   to help agents become more efficient and managers more engaged.
     * Time & attendance
       Automatically track all of the time spent on tickets, chats, and
       calls. Create custom AUX states to track lunch, breaks, and other
       non-support activities.
     * Scheduling
       Quickly create complete intraday schedules and view staffing across
       all channels. Agents can view their schedule without ever leaving
       Zendesk.
     * Presence
       See what all of your agents are doing in real-time across all
       channels. Filter by activity type, group, or build your own views.
     * Real-time WFM reporting
       Never miss a minute with real-time WFM reporting. You can dive into
       the details or get a birds-eye-view of the big picture.
     * Activity tracking
       Get true visibility with a complete picture of each agent’s day
       that’s sure to uncover coaching opportunities.
     * Schedule adherence
       Overlay your intraday schedule on your agent’s activity timeline
       and find out if your plan went according to plan.
     * Agent scorecard
       Drive productivity through transparency. Customize your agents
       scorecard with the metrics that matter to your organization.
     * Notifications
       Configure custom rules and get alerted when things are going awry.
       Notify a team lead when an agent is late for lunch or in an idle
       state for too long.
     * Forecasting
       Plan for the future by forecasting the number of contacts across
       all channels and how many agents you’ll need to handle them.

Made for everyone

   Used in 50+ countries by the world's biggest and most forward thinking
   brands.

Charlene Hopkins
       Manager, Customer Support & Workforce Management, Upwork
       We were searching for a Workforce Management solution to aid us in
       improving oversight of our remote teams, schedule and maintain
       adherence, as well as help us to understand varying handle times of
       agents for specific customer issues. Tymeshift has already proven
       to be an invaluable tool in identifying agent performance patterns
       and areas for improvement.
       With the customizations made, we’ve also been able to seamlessly
       bridge Tymeshift’s intelligence with our existing processes.
       They’ve taken painstaking steps to understand our business
       challenges and the information we wanted to glean in order to
       tailor a solution that worked for us. I’m confident that this tool
       will pay for itself many times over in efficiency alone, in
       addition to making our managers lives much easier!

Clade Lindström
       Quality Coordinator
       “Tymeshift helps us to maintain and strengthen our customer support
       agents all over the globe. It gives us the opportunity to oversee
       our metrics and KPIs from different locations and time zones. This
       also allows us to understand our agents’ behavior and address
       quality concerns more mindfully and effectively.
       I also appreciate that the team listens to my ideas for improving
       the product and customer experience and that they are really
       collaborative. Looking forward to working with these guys more in
       the Tymes to come.”

Aaron Alpeter
       Chief Supply Chain Officer at Hubble Contacts
       HUBBLE (hubblecontacts.com) Our initial launch was much bigger than
       we had anticipated and we were having a hard time keeping up with
       the growth and knowing how to hold each other accountable. I was
       spending a lot of time trying to make sure if people were doing
       what they were supposed to be doing and Zendesk’s internal
       reporting just wasn’t cutting it.
       Tymeshift was an absolute game changer for us and I was able to
       pivot to other parts of the business knowing that I had clear and
       transparent metrics for my team.

Clark Roberts
       Senior Team Leader
       Since installing Tymeshift, I've been able to ditch my ROTA and
       intraday spreadsheets, avoided having to download numerous reports
       to update KPI/productivity spreadsheets, been able to track
       adherence with more confidence, been able to schedule for a
       flexible workforce with greater ease, and increased visibility on
       performance for my agents and team leaders.
       I’ve also felt I have strong support when needed, and that my
       feedback is valued. Love keeping this many systems in one place.
       I'm excited to see how Tymeshift develops going forward!

Frequently asked questions

   Click to copy this link to your clipboard
     * Does any data that you use remain within the Zendesk
       infrastructure?
       The data Tymeshift collects is primarily related to agent activity
       and productivity. For example, Tymeshift collects that a ticket was
       solved, by whom, and at what time it was solved. This data is
       stored inside of Tymeshift’s database and used to calculate metrics
       for reporting purposes.
     * Does data travel back and forth between Tymeshift and Zendesk?
       No, Tymeshift collects agent productivity data from Zendesk (as
       described in the above answer) but does not send that data back to
       Zendesk. This data is primarily used to calculate the
       productivity/performance of agents and thus does not need to be
       sent back to Zendesk.
     * What data does Tymeshift store from Zendesk? Is any personal
       information collected?
       Tymeshift does not store customer related data. The data Tymeshift
       collects is related to the productivity/performance of agents.
       Specifically, we collect Zendesk events on tickets, time spent on
       tickets and other activities, as well as satisfaction ratings. The
       personal data collected is related to your agents inside of
       Zendesk. Specifically, the agent’s profile name and email address.
     * Which Zendesk API Endpoints does Tymeshift use?
       You can learn about the Zendesk API Endpoints that we utilize to
       provide our service here.
     * If an employee asks us to delete all their data off the system, how
       do we request that?
       We are happy to purge any data at your request. You can find more
       details on this process here under the “How to invoke your rights”
       section.
     * How long does Tymeshift store my data?
       Tymeshift stores your data as long as your account is active. In
       the event you wish your data to be purged while your account is
       still active you may submit a request via following the process
       outlined here under the “How to invoke your rights” section.
     * What path does Tymeshift offer to responsibly disclose security
       vulnerabilities?
       Please report security vulnerabilities you have uncovered to:
       [email protected] Your responsible disclosure is deeply
       appreciated.
