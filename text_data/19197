   Tokyo, July 9, 2019 – Rakuten Mobile, Inc. announced that a resolution
   was passed at the Board of Directors meeting held July 4, 2019 in which
   “DMM mobile”, the MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) business
   operated by DMM.com LLC, and “DMM Hikari,” the high quality internet
   service business operated by DMM.com LLC which utilizes “Flet’s
   Hikari,” will be transferred to Rakuten Mobile through a company split
   effective as of September 1, 2019 (tentative). A total of approximately
   2.3 billion yen will be delivered as consideration for the company
   split to DMM.com LLC.
   Rakuten Mobile began providing its MVNO service “Rakuten Mobile” in
   October 2014. Since launch, it has expanded its number of subscribers
   and now holds the top share^*1 in the Japanese domestic MVNO market. By
   leveraging the synergies between the diverse lineup of services offered
   by the Rakuten Group and the Rakuten Super Points loyalty program,
   Rakuten Mobile aims to provide a value-added mobile service to its
   subscribers. Revenue from the business has expanded 6-fold since the
   launch of the service, and there are now more than 500 Rakuten Mobile
   shops nationwide (as of May 10, 2019).
   DMM mobile is an MVNO service that utilizes the LTE/3G network of NTT
   DOCOMO, Inc. Since its launch in December 2014, DMM mobile has provided
   a low-cost high-quality mobile communications service, and its domestic
   MVNO business (SIM-card-based communications business) has
   approximately 240,000 subscribers (as of June 30, 2019). DMM Hikari is
   a high quality internet communications service that utilizes the fiber
   optic lines of NTT Hikari, and serves approximately 20,000 subscribers
   (as of June 30, 2019).
   The transfer of DMM mobile and DMM Hikari to Rakuten Mobile will allow
   the company to expand the customer base of its mobile business and
   further strengthen membership benefits of the Rakuten Ecosystem. There
   are also plans in development to maximize synergy with the other
   services and business in the Rakuten Ecosystem, including transition to
   the Rakuten Super Points loyalty program after the transfer comes into
   effect.
   Going forward, Rakuten Mobile aims to improve its services based on a
   “customer first” philosophy and, through close collaboration with the
   MNO (mobile network operator) services set to launch in October 2019,
   aims to make customers’ lives even more convenient and enjoyable.
   *1 Based on a market survey on the low cost SIM service usage carried
   out by MMD Labo in March 2019 (Japanese only)

   Tokyo, July 9, 2019 – Rakuten Mobile, Inc. announced that a resolution
   was passed at the Board of Directors meeting held July 4, 2019 in which
   “DMM mobile”, the MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) business
   operated by DMM.com LLC, and “DMM Hikari,” the high quality internet
   service business operated by DMM.com LLC which utilizes “Flet’s
   Hikari,” will be transferred to Rakuten Mobile through a company split
   effective as of September 1, 2019 (tentative). A total of approximately
   2.3 billion yen will be delivered as consideration for the company
   split to DMM.com LLC.
   Rakuten Mobile began providing its MVNO service “Rakuten Mobile” in
   October 2014. Since launch, it has expanded its number of subscribers
   and now holds the top share^*1 in the Japanese domestic MVNO market. By
   leveraging the synergies between the diverse lineup of services offered
   by the Rakuten Group and the Rakuten Super Points loyalty program,
   Rakuten Mobile aims to provide a value-added mobile service to its
   subscribers. Revenue from the business has expanded 6-fold since the
   launch of the service, and there are now more than 500 Rakuten Mobile
   shops nationwide (as of May 10, 2019).
   DMM mobile is an MVNO service that utilizes the LTE/3G network of NTT
   DOCOMO, Inc. Since its launch in December 2014, DMM mobile has provided
   a low-cost high-quality mobile communications service, and its domestic
   MVNO business (SIM-card-based communications business) has
   approximately 240,000 subscribers (as of June 30, 2019). DMM Hikari is
   a high quality internet communications service that utilizes the fiber
   optic lines of NTT Hikari, and serves approximately 20,000 subscribers
   (as of June 30, 2019).
   The transfer of DMM mobile and DMM Hikari to Rakuten Mobile will allow
   the company to expand the customer base of its mobile business and
   further strengthen membership benefits of the Rakuten Ecosystem. There
   are also plans in development to maximize synergy with the other
   services and business in the Rakuten Ecosystem, including transition to
   the Rakuten Super Points loyalty program after the transfer comes into
   effect.
   Going forward, Rakuten Mobile aims to improve its services based on a
   “customer first” philosophy and, through close collaboration with the
   MNO (mobile network operator) services set to launch in October 2019,
   aims to make customers’ lives even more convenient and enjoyable.
   *1 Based on a market survey on the low cost SIM service usage carried
   out by MMD Labo in March 2019 (Japanese only)
