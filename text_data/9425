Election results invite questions for liberals. Worldwide, they lack their
rivals’ discipline

Liberals are facing similar problems elsewhere: they lack the discipline of
their rivals and before they realise that they should close ranks, the
populists have changed the rules of the game for good – or for the span of
time during which the strongman is in command.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   default, because they did not consider that the opposition offered a
   viable alternative.

   The 2019 general elections have been won by Narendra Modi – like the
   previous ones, but in a different context. In 2014, the Modi wave
   relied primarily, it seemed, on the promise of development. Five years
   later, Modi did not even mention vikas in his election campaign, simply
   because his government has failed on that front – as evident from the
   rise of joblessness. So, for what reasons could he attract such a
   massive support?

   The growing acceptability of Hindu nationalism needs to be factored in
   first because this ideology has been the main motivation of the
   traditional BJP voters and this core group is now expanding. It has
   clearly appreciated the communal overtone of the past five years, an
   unprecedented phase of Indian history which have been marked by
   recurrent campaigns against love jihad, in favour of ghar wapsi
   (reconversion) and cow protection (including dozens of lynchings of
   innocent Muslims). These hardcore supporters have also approved of the
   mainstreamisation of erstwhile fringe elements of the Hindutva nebula,
   including Pragya Singh Thakur whose election to parliament will remain
   the symbol of this election.

   But only a fraction of the BJP voters would say that they support Modi
   because of Hindutva. What about the others? There are several
   possibilities here. First, they do believe in the same brand of
   Hindutva – at least they have no problem with Hindu majoritarianism –
   but they prefer to give other explanations for their votes. Indeed,
   Modi offered another good reason to vote for him this time: national
   security. The Pakistan-centered turn that the election campaign took
   after Pulwama enabled the Prime minister to present himself as the
   protector of the country. He argued that India needed a strong man in
   this context and that his opponents would give a weak government
   because it would inevitably be based on coalitions. Some voters did not
   use this rhetoric of the strong man as an excuse but took it at face
   value. Among them, many considered indeed that the opposition did not
   offer a viable alternative because Rahul Gandhi was not a sufficiently
   experienced leader.

   This reading of the 17th Indian election, that is supported by the
   findings of the Lokniti-CSDS exit poll, suggests three conclusions.
   Advertising

   First, India has made one more step in the invention of a de facto
   ethnic democracy. While this formula has been coined by an Israeli
   political scientist, Sammy Smooha, for defining the regime of his
   country, a de jure jewish state, India continues to be secular on the
   paper but in practice minorities are becoming second class citizens –
   as the underrepresentation of Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha shows.

   Second, India has also made one more step on the way to an illiberal
   democracy. This trend, during the election campaign, has been
   reinforced by the loss of credibility of the Election Commission and
   the media. It flows logically from the populist idiom of Indian
   politics: when a man embodies the nation and projects himself as its
   savior against all kinds of threats, to question his authority becomes
   illegitimate. And the stronger he is, the smaller the space for
   exerting a critical mind. As a result, there’s been no press conference
   worth that name, hardly any assessment of the past policies – not to
   say anything of the traditional debates between the main contenders
   that are the most exciting episodes of liberal democracies. Instead,
   Narendra Modi has saturated the public space, benefiting from a hugely
   imbalanced access to electronic media on prime time and record
   electoral expenditures which have transformed the official ceilings
   into a farce. All this reflects the growing convergence of India with
   other ethnic, illiberal and national-populist democracies, including
   not only Israel, but also Brazil, Hungary, Turkey and, to some extent,
   the US. In these countries too, a man has projected himself as the
   savior of a nation reduced to the majority community against external
   and internal threats, polarizing society and the public opinion to such
   an extent that those who are not with them are against them – a way to
   divide not only society, but also families. Indeed, in this new form of
   regime, political adversaries have been transformed into enemies –
   enemies of the people and the nation – in the name of security. Most of
   the illiberal democracies are also, therefore, security states as their
   populist leaders need threats to fight in order to divert attention
   from their socio-economic limitations and to mobilise their supporters.

   Third, in Indian politics, policies do not matter as much as before:
   while an election campaign used to be a moment for assessing the
   achievements of the outgoing PM and compare programs, this time the
   campaign was not about jobs, the crisis of the peasantry, environment,
   but about emotions – fear, anger and mangoes, a cocktail that is part
   of the populist recipe across the world. Incidentally, the Congress
   program addressed some of the major issues India is facing – including
   ecological disasters, liberticide laws and mass poverty – but it was
   not discussed…

   However, some Indian citizens have also voted for Modi by default,
   because they did not consider that the opposition offered a viable
   alternative. In fact, the same people who have supported his opponents
   at the state level in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh six months ago,
   have given their vote to Modi this time. Why has the opposition failed
   to make any dent in the Modi mania?

   Not only because the competition was biased – Modi had more money and
   more support in the media, including the social media where an army of
   paid trolls has demolished the reputation of Rahul Gandhi the way Trump
   did vis-à-vis Clinton few years ago -, but also because the opposition
   has not been able to show the voters what kind of government it would
   offer. To win against Modi, it needed to rally around a leader who
   could be projected as a PM in waiting. Many state party leaders,
   including Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee
   and Prakash Ambedkar, considered that BJP was posing a threat to
   democracy, but they did not resign themselves to go for seat
   adjustments with Congress. Why? First explanation: they may think that
   they can live with a BJP government in New Delhi if they are still in a
   position to govern their state. Second: their attachment to democracy
   and secularism is rather shallow and, in fact, many of them have been
   allies of the BJP in the past – why not again? Third, many opponents
   live in wonderland – or in the past: they have not adjusted to the “new
   normal” of the majoritarian era. Some of them even dream of a tabula
   rasa on which they could build an ideal state. They even ask Congress
   to commit suicide, forgetting that the making of a party from scratch
   is not an easy task – Kejriwal has tried… – and any waste of time
   damages democracy further.

   Liberals are facing similar problems elsewhere: they lack the
   discipline of their rivals and before they realise that they should
   close ranks, the populists have changed the rules of the game for good
   – or for the span of time during which the strongman is in command.

Quota and bad faith

UP government’s bid to revisit reservation model is as debatable as Centre’s

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Election results invite questions for liberals. Worldwide, they lack their
rivals’ discipline

Liberals are facing similar problems elsewhere: they lack the discipline of
their rivals and before they realise that they should close ranks, the
populists have changed the rules of the game for good – or for the span of
time during which the strongman is in command.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   default, because they did not consider that the opposition offered a
   viable alternative.

   The 2019 general elections have been won by Narendra Modi – like the
   previous ones, but in a different context. In 2014, the Modi wave
   relied primarily, it seemed, on the promise of development. Five years
   later, Modi did not even mention vikas in his election campaign, simply
   because his government has failed on that front – as evident from the
   rise of joblessness. So, for what reasons could he attract such a
   massive support?

   Advertising

   The growing acceptability of Hindu nationalism needs to be factored in
   first because this ideology has been the main motivation of the
   traditional BJP voters and this core group is now expanding. It has
   clearly appreciated the communal overtone of the past five years, an
   unprecedented phase of Indian history which have been marked by
   recurrent campaigns against love jihad, in favour of ghar wapsi
   (reconversion) and cow protection (including dozens of lynchings of
   innocent Muslims). These hardcore supporters have also approved of the
   mainstreamisation of erstwhile fringe elements of the Hindutva nebula,
   including Pragya Singh Thakur whose election to parliament will remain
   the symbol of this election.

   But only a fraction of the BJP voters would say that they support Modi
   because of Hindutva. What about the others? There are several
   possibilities here. First, they do believe in the same brand of
   Hindutva – at least they have no problem with Hindu majoritarianism –
   but they prefer to give other explanations for their votes. Indeed,
   Modi offered another good reason to vote for him this time: national
   security. The Pakistan-centered turn that the election campaign took
   after Pulwama enabled the Prime minister to present himself as the
   protector of the country. He argued that India needed a strong man in
   this context and that his opponents would give a weak government
   because it would inevitably be based on coalitions. Some voters did not
   use this rhetoric of the strong man as an excuse but took it at face
   value. Among them, many considered indeed that the opposition did not
   offer a viable alternative because Rahul Gandhi was not a sufficiently
   experienced leader.

   This reading of the 17th Indian election, that is supported by the
   findings of the Lokniti-CSDS exit poll, suggests three conclusions.
   Advertising

   First, India has made one more step in the invention of a de facto
   ethnic democracy. While this formula has been coined by an Israeli
   political scientist, Sammy Smooha, for defining the regime of his
   country, a de jure jewish state, India continues to be secular on the
   paper but in practice minorities are becoming second class citizens –
   as the underrepresentation of Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha shows.

   Second, India has also made one more step on the way to an illiberal
   democracy. This trend, during the election campaign, has been
   reinforced by the loss of credibility of the Election Commission and
   the media. It flows logically from the populist idiom of Indian
   politics: when a man embodies the nation and projects himself as its
   savior against all kinds of threats, to question his authority becomes
   illegitimate. And the stronger he is, the smaller the space for
   exerting a critical mind. As a result, there’s been no press conference
   worth that name, hardly any assessment of the past policies – not to
   say anything of the traditional debates between the main contenders
   that are the most exciting episodes of liberal democracies. Instead,
   Narendra Modi has saturated the public space, benefiting from a hugely
   imbalanced access to electronic media on prime time and record
   electoral expenditures which have transformed the official ceilings
   into a farce. All this reflects the growing convergence of India with
   other ethnic, illiberal and national-populist democracies, including
   not only Israel, but also Brazil, Hungary, Turkey and, to some extent,
   the US. In these countries too, a man has projected himself as the
   savior of a nation reduced to the majority community against external
   and internal threats, polarizing society and the public opinion to such
   an extent that those who are not with them are against them – a way to
   divide not only society, but also families. Indeed, in this new form of
   regime, political adversaries have been transformed into enemies –
   enemies of the people and the nation – in the name of security. Most of
   the illiberal democracies are also, therefore, security states as their
   populist leaders need threats to fight in order to divert attention
   from their socio-economic limitations and to mobilise their supporters.

   Third, in Indian politics, policies do not matter as much as before:
   while an election campaign used to be a moment for assessing the
   achievements of the outgoing PM and compare programs, this time the
   campaign was not about jobs, the crisis of the peasantry, environment,
   but about emotions – fear, anger and mangoes, a cocktail that is part
   of the populist recipe across the world. Incidentally, the Congress
   program addressed some of the major issues India is facing – including
   ecological disasters, liberticide laws and mass poverty – but it was
   not discussed…

   However, some Indian citizens have also voted for Modi by default,
   because they did not consider that the opposition offered a viable
   alternative. In fact, the same people who have supported his opponents
   at the state level in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh six months ago,
   have given their vote to Modi this time. Why has the opposition failed
   to make any dent in the Modi mania?

   Not only because the competition was biased – Modi had more money and
   more support in the media, including the social media where an army of
   paid trolls has demolished the reputation of Rahul Gandhi the way Trump
   did vis-à-vis Clinton few years ago -, but also because the opposition
   has not been able to show the voters what kind of government it would
   offer. To win against Modi, it needed to rally around a leader who
   could be projected as a PM in waiting. Many state party leaders,
   including Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee
   and Prakash Ambedkar, considered that BJP was posing a threat to
   democracy, but they did not resign themselves to go for seat
   adjustments with Congress. Why? First explanation: they may think that
   they can live with a BJP government in New Delhi if they are still in a
   position to govern their state. Second: their attachment to democracy
   and secularism is rather shallow and, in fact, many of them have been
   allies of the BJP in the past – why not again? Third, many opponents
   live in wonderland – or in the past: they have not adjusted to the “new
   normal” of the majoritarian era. Some of them even dream of a tabula
   rasa on which they could build an ideal state. They even ask Congress
   to commit suicide, forgetting that the making of a party from scratch
   is not an easy task – Kejriwal has tried… – and any waste of time
   damages democracy further.

   Liberals are facing similar problems elsewhere: they lack the
   discipline of their rivals and before they realise that they should
   close ranks, the populists have changed the rules of the game for good
   – or for the span of time during which the strongman is in command.

   enemies of the people and the nation – in the name of security. Most of
   the illiberal democracies are also, therefore, security states as their
   populist leaders need threats to fight in order to divert attention
   from their socio-economic limitations and to mobilise their supporters.

   Third, in Indian politics, policies do not matter as much as before:
   while an election campaign used to be a moment for assessing the
   achievements of the outgoing PM and compare programs, this time the
   campaign was not about jobs, the crisis of the peasantry, environment,
   but about emotions – fear, anger and mangoes, a cocktail that is part
   of the populist recipe across the world. Incidentally, the Congress
   program addressed some of the major issues India is facing – including
   ecological disasters, liberticide laws and mass poverty – but it was
   not discussed…

   However, some Indian citizens have also voted for Modi by default,
   because they did not consider that the opposition offered a viable
   alternative. In fact, the same people who have supported his opponents
   at the state level in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh six months ago,
   have given their vote to Modi this time. Why has the opposition failed
   to make any dent in the Modi mania?

   Not only because the competition was biased – Modi had more money and
   more support in the media, including the social media where an army of
   paid trolls has demolished the reputation of Rahul Gandhi the way Trump
   did vis-à-vis Clinton few years ago -, but also because the opposition
   has not been able to show the voters what kind of government it would
   offer. To win against Modi, it needed to rally around a leader who
   could be projected as a PM in waiting. Many state party leaders,
   including Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee
   and Prakash Ambedkar, considered that BJP was posing a threat to
   democracy, but they did not resign themselves to go for seat
   adjustments with Congress. Why? First explanation: they may think that
   they can live with a BJP government in New Delhi if they are still in a
   position to govern their state. Second: their attachment to democracy
   and secularism is rather shallow and, in fact, many of them have been
   allies of the BJP in the past – why not again? Third, many opponents
   live in wonderland – or in the past: they have not adjusted to the “new
   normal” of the majoritarian era. Some of them even dream of a tabula
   rasa on which they could build an ideal state. They even ask Congress
   to commit suicide, forgetting that the making of a party from scratch
   is not an easy task – Kejriwal has tried… – and any waste of time
   damages democracy further.

   Liberals are facing similar problems elsewhere: they lack the
   discipline of their rivals and before they realise that they should
   close ranks, the populists have changed the rules of the game for good
   – or for the span of time during which the strongman is in command.

Quota and bad faith

UP government’s bid to revisit reservation model is as debatable as Centre’s

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.
   Advertising

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019
   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.
   (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   Advertising

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019
   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.
   (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   Advertising

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.
