Welcome to Apache Commons

   Apache Commons is an Apache project focused on all aspects of reusable
   Java components.

   The Apache Commons project is composed of three parts:
     * The Commons Proper - A repository of reusable Java components.
     * The Commons Sandbox - A workspace for Java component development.
     * The Commons Dormant - A repository of components that are currently
       inactive.

   You may also read our charter, which spells out the goals of the
   project in greater detail.

   The Apache Commons source code repositories are writable for all ASF
   committers. While Apache Commons is a Commit-Then-Review community, we
   would consider it polite and helpful for contributors to announce their
   intentions and plans on the dev mailing list before committing code.
   All contributors should read our contributing guidelines. We accept
   patches as SVN diff files uploaded to the Apache bugtracker or as pull
   request via our github mirrors.

Apache Commons Proper

   Commons Proper is dedicated to one principal goal: creating and
   maintaining reusable Java components. The Commons Proper is a place for
   collaboration and sharing, where developers from throughout the Apache
   community can work together on projects to be shared by the Apache
   projects and Apache users.

   Commons developers will make an effort to ensure that their components
   have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that these components
   can be deployed easily. In addition, Commons components will keep their
   interfaces as stable as possible, so that Apache users (including other
   Apache projects) can implement these components without having to worry
   about changes in the future.

   This article gives an overview of (some of) the components which can be
   found here.

   We welcome participation from all that are interested, at all skill
   levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical parts of the
   software development process. If you are interested in participating in
   any of these aspects, please join us!

The Commons Sandbox

   The Commons project also contains a workspace that is open to all
   Apache committers. It's a place to try out new ideas and prepare for
   inclusion into the Commons portion of the project or into another
   Apache project. Users are free to experiment with the components
   developed in the sandbox, but sandbox components will not necessarily
   be maintained, particularly in their current state.

   See here for Sandbox components.

The Commons Dormant

   These are Commons components that have been deemed inactive since they
   have seen little recent development activity. If you wish to use any of
   these components, you must build them yourselves. It is best to assume
   that these components will not be released in the near future.

   See here for Dormant components.

Where do I get releases?

   The individual components have independent releases. Some releases for
   some components may be available only through the mirroring system.
   Some releases for some components (typically the older ones) are not
   available through the mirroring system.

   See the individual websites listed above for the specific downloads, or
   use the Releases menu option.

How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?

   The Commons project really needs and appreciates any contributions,
   including documentation help, source code and feedback.
     * Discussion occurs on the Commons mailing list.
     * We have an IRC channel on freenode - join #apache-commons.
     * Access to the SVN commons/proper repository is available both
       online and with a svn client.
     * Access to the SVN commons/sandbox repository is available both
       online and with a svn client.
     * Access to the SVN commons/dormant repository is available both
       online and with a svn client.
