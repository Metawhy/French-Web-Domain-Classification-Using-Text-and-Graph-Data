Borderlands 3 Is 2K's Fastest Selling Game Ever

   see deal
   Borderlands 3 - Xbox One
   $59.99on Amazon
   publisher 2K says the looter shooter sold over five million copies
   during its first five days on the market, making it the fastest-selling
   game in the company's history.

   That works out at 50 percent more sales than Borderlands 2 during the
   same launch window - a game which went on to sell over 22 million
   units.
   The high figures were achieved despite backlash from fans when it was
   announced the PC version of Borderlands 3 would be an Epic Games
   exclusive. A press release from 2K announcing the sales records draws
   attention to the store figures in particular, saying "Borderlands 3
   delivered the highest pre-order sales figures to date for a 2K title,
   as well as broke pre-order records with the Epic Games Store. Initial
   sales of Borderlands 3 have exceeded the label’s expectations and, in
   particular, PC sales of the title through the Epic Games Store have
   been incredibly strong."
   Over 70 percent of Borderlands 3's sales were digital, and the game has
   consistently pulled views over on Twitch. 2K says it's generated more
   than 14 million hours of content on the streaming platform, which is
   more than half the viewership that Borderlands 2 generated over seven
   years.
   Our review said Borderlands 3 was the best in a series of great co-op
   shooters. Our full thoughts are in the video above.
   Despite copies flying off virtual shelves, the first few days of
   Borderlands 3 involved some teething problems. Players on PC reported
   problems with cloud saves, while split-screen play had some performance
   issues.

PlayStation 5 Will Include Power Saving Feature to Tackle Climate Change

The ultimate boss battle.

   By IGN Staff
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 9:42 am

   The PlayStation 5 will have an optional setting to slash the amount of
   power the next-generation console consumes in standby mode.

   In a blog post, Sony announced it's working with the United Nations as
   part of its "Playing For The Planet" initiative, which aims to mobilise
   gamers to take an active role in combating climate change. Part of this
   effort involves partnered companies like PlayStation examining ways
   they can reduce their carbon footprint, and Sony is committing to
   working sustainable features into its new console's design.
   "The next generation PlayStation console will include the possibility
   to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4 (which
   we estimate can be achieved at around 0.5 W),” writes Jim Ryan,
   President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “If just one
   million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the
   average electricity use of 1,000 US homes.”
   Environmental safeguarding is ace, and in the video above we list more
   PS5 features we really want.
   Compared to other forms of technology, gaming is notorious for its
   carbon footprint. A recent report found that American gamers emit
   around 12 million tons of carbon dioxide annually - the equivalent of
   2.3 million cars. PlayStation has been working to reduce the
   environmental impact of the PS4 for the past few years by introducing
   energy saving modes and tweaking its hardware.
   "For context, we estimate the carbon emissions we have avoided to date
   already amount to almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29
   million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals
   the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017)," Ryan claimed.
   The PS4 has sold over 100 million units worldwide, so if the next
   member of Sony's console family sells anywhere near as much, power
   saving features could have a huge impact - but only if players care
   about it. Since the setting is optional, those who purchase a PS5 will
   have to activate it themselves.

   "The gaming community is diverse and growing at a fast pace," Ryan
   wrote. "There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games
   industry to take a stand and support the UN Environment team by
   communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for
   generations to come."
   Tomorrow is Sony's State of Play presentation, and we've rounded up
   everything we expect to see. In the meantime, back in May PS5's lead
   system architect detailed some of the components the team's already put
   in the console.

Box Office: Downton Abbey Trounces Rambo: Last Blood and Ad Astra

Brad Pitt and Sylvester Stallone get served.

   The posh upstairs/downstairs antics of Downton Abbey: The Movie - the
   cinematic sequel to Julian Fellowes' hit TV series - was enough of a
   dapper draw to rake in an estimated $31 million in its opening weekend.
   It's a handsome haul that proved too much to overcome for Sylvester
   Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood and Brad Pitt's sci-fi flick, Ad Astra.

   Adding in the overseas box office, Downton Abbey's pulled in $30.8
   million, bringing its entire run so far to $61.8 million. Which is the
   type of take vs. budget (a meager $13 million) that might have Focus
   Features and Universal Pictures International working feverishly to
   craft a sequel.
   Last Blood and Ad Astra didn't perform poorly however, with Pitt's
   well-reviewed space mystery snagging second place with $19.2 million.
   It was enough to just barely edge out Stallone's final installment in
   the 37-year Rambo franchise, which made $19 million.
   IGN's reviews of the films reported that Rambo: Last Blood encapsulated
   everything wrong with the franchise and that Ad Astra was an
   eye-popping spectacle too bleak to truly connect with.
   Meanwhile, Downton Abbey was filled with enough memorable performances
   to possibly make it an Oscar contender.

North American Box Office Estimates

   Rounding out the Top 5 are It: Chapter Two, which earned $17.2 million
   in its fourth weekend and wound up passing the $200 million mark
   internationally, and Hustlers, which brought in $17 million.
   Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also wound up passing
   the $200 million mark internationally this weekend.
   Here are the weekend's Top 10 North American box office estimates (via
   Box Office Mojo)
     * 1. Downton Abbey $31,000,000
     * 2. Ad Astra $19,210,000
     * 3. Rambo: Last Blood $19,015,000
     * 4. IT: Chapter Two $17,245,000
     * 5. Hustlers $17,000,000
     * 6. The Lion King $2,572,000
     * 7. Good Boys $2,510,000
     * 8. Angel Has Fallen $2,400,000
     * 9. Overcomer $1,500,000
     * 10. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw $1,460,000

Death Stranding Gameplay: Kojima Gives a Tour of Sam's Private Room (Now in
English)

Customize gear, play music, plan your adventure, and so much more.

   At Tokyo Game Show 2019, Hideo Kojima showed off and discussed nearly
   35 minutes of Death Stranding
   see deal
   Death Stranding - PlayStation 4
   $59.99on Amazon
   gameplay that focused on Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges' private
   room, where Sam can customize his gear, play music, display figures,
   and even have nightmares. IGN has fully translated Kojima's gameplay
   commentary, which was previously only available in Japanese.

   Watch the video above to see the full gameplay demonstration, now with
   English subtitles.
   Last week, we broke down this demo that also reveals that if the camera
   lingers too much on Sam's crotch, he will punch said camera.
   This follows another 49-minute Death Stranding demo with Kojima
   commentary that IGN has also translated that focuses more on the
   open-world gameplay and giving fans an in-depth look of this much
   anticipated game in action. You can see the full video below!
   You can check out everything we learned about Death Stranding's
   gameplay from this TGS 2019 stream, as well as 105 details about Death
   Stranding that you might have missed.
   If that isn't enough, we've gathered every Death Stranding trailer and
   cinematic so far in one place to ensure you are up-to-date on
   everything revealed so far for the PlayStation 4 exclusive that will be
   released on November 8, 2019.

   Kojima has recently opened up a lot more about Death Stranding and
   explained how it is a metaphor for modern day society and that he
   believes more Death Stranding games are needed for his idea of a
   "Strand" genre to catch on.
   Death Standing stars Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and he is a delivery
   man of sorts that must help reunite the United States by connecting
   cities through the Chiral Network.
   Get straight to the action moments of the latest Death Stranding
   gameplay demo with the below video!

Borderlands 3 Is 2K's Fastest Selling Game Ever

Kaching.

   Alysia Judge

   Updated: 23 Sep 2019 11:30 pm
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 1:50 pm

   Borderlands 3's
   see deal
   Borderlands 3 - Xbox One
   $59.99on Amazon
   publisher 2K says the looter shooter sold over five million copies
   during its first five days on the market, making it the fastest-selling
   game in the company's history.

   That works out at 50 percent more sales than Borderlands 2 during the
   same launch window - a game which went on to sell over 22 million
   units.
   The high figures were achieved despite backlash from fans when it was
   announced the PC version of Borderlands 3 would be an Epic Games
   exclusive. A press release from 2K announcing the sales records draws
   attention to the store figures in particular, saying "Borderlands 3
   delivered the highest pre-order sales figures to date for a 2K title,
   as well as broke pre-order records with the Epic Games Store. Initial
   sales of Borderlands 3 have exceeded the label’s expectations and, in
   particular, PC sales of the title through the Epic Games Store have
   been incredibly strong."
   Over 70 percent of Borderlands 3's sales were digital, and the game has
   consistently pulled views over on Twitch. 2K says it's generated more
   than 14 million hours of content on the streaming platform, which is
   more than half the viewership that Borderlands 2 generated over seven
   years.
   Our review said Borderlands 3 was the best in a series of great co-op
   shooters. Our full thoughts are in the video above.
   Despite copies flying off virtual shelves, the first few days of
   Borderlands 3 involved some teething problems. Players on PC reported
   problems with cloud saves, while split-screen play had some performance
   issues.

PlayStation 5 Will Include Power Saving Feature to Tackle Climate Change

The ultimate boss battle.

   By IGN Staff
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 9:42 am

   The PlayStation 5 will have an optional setting to slash the amount of
   power the next-generation console consumes in standby mode.

   In a blog post, Sony announced it's working with the United Nations as
   part of its "Playing For The Planet" initiative, which aims to mobilise
   gamers to take an active role in combating climate change. Part of this
   effort involves partnered companies like PlayStation examining ways
   they can reduce their carbon footprint, and Sony is committing to
   working sustainable features into its new console's design.
   "The next generation PlayStation console will include the possibility
   to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4 (which
   we estimate can be achieved at around 0.5 W),” writes Jim Ryan,
   President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “If just one
   million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the
   average electricity use of 1,000 US homes.”
   Environmental safeguarding is ace, and in the video above we list more
   PS5 features we really want.
   Compared to other forms of technology, gaming is notorious for its
   carbon footprint. A recent report found that American gamers emit
   around 12 million tons of carbon dioxide annually - the equivalent of
   2.3 million cars. PlayStation has been working to reduce the
   environmental impact of the PS4 for the past few years by introducing
   energy saving modes and tweaking its hardware.
   "For context, we estimate the carbon emissions we have avoided to date
   already amount to almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29
   million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals
   the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017)," Ryan claimed.
   The PS4 has sold over 100 million units worldwide, so if the next
   member of Sony's console family sells anywhere near as much, power
   saving features could have a huge impact - but only if players care
   about it. Since the setting is optional, those who purchase a PS5 will
   have to activate it themselves.

   "The gaming community is diverse and growing at a fast pace," Ryan
   wrote. "There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games
   industry to take a stand and support the UN Environment team by
   communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for
   generations to come."
   Tomorrow is Sony's State of Play presentation, and we've rounded up
   everything we expect to see. In the meantime, back in May PS5's lead
   system architect detailed some of the components the team's already put
   in the console.

Box Office: Downton Abbey Trounces Rambo: Last Blood and Ad Astra

Brad Pitt and Sylvester Stallone get served.

   The posh upstairs/downstairs antics of Downton Abbey: The Movie - the
   cinematic sequel to Julian Fellowes' hit TV series - was enough of a
   dapper draw to rake in an estimated $31 million in its opening weekend.
   It's a handsome haul that proved too much to overcome for Sylvester
   Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood and Brad Pitt's sci-fi flick, Ad Astra.

   Adding in the overseas box office, Downton Abbey's pulled in $30.8
   million, bringing its entire run so far to $61.8 million. Which is the
   type of take vs. budget (a meager $13 million) that might have Focus
   Features and Universal Pictures International working feverishly to
   craft a sequel.
   Last Blood and Ad Astra didn't perform poorly however, with Pitt's
   well-reviewed space mystery snagging second place with $19.2 million.
   It was enough to just barely edge out Stallone's final installment in
   the 37-year Rambo franchise, which made $19 million.
   IGN's reviews of the films reported that Rambo: Last Blood encapsulated
   everything wrong with the franchise and that Ad Astra was an
   eye-popping spectacle too bleak to truly connect with.
   Meanwhile, Downton Abbey was filled with enough memorable performances
   to possibly make it an Oscar contender.

North American Box Office Estimates

   Rounding out the Top 5 are It: Chapter Two, which earned $17.2 million
   in its fourth weekend and wound up passing the $200 million mark
   internationally, and Hustlers, which brought in $17 million.
   Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also wound up passing
   the $200 million mark internationally this weekend.
   Here are the weekend's Top 10 North American box office estimates (via
   Box Office Mojo)
     * 1. Downton Abbey $31,000,000
     * 2. Ad Astra $19,210,000
     * 3. Rambo: Last Blood $19,015,000
     * 4. IT: Chapter Two $17,245,000
     * 5. Hustlers $17,000,000
     * 6. The Lion King $2,572,000
     * 7. Good Boys $2,510,000
     * 8. Angel Has Fallen $2,400,000
     * 9. Overcomer $1,500,000
     * 10. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw $1,460,000

   ceremony, dominating below-the-line categories including casting,
   costumes, main title design, makeup, score, editing, sound editing,
   sound mixing, special visual effects, and stunt coordination.
   Earlier in the night, Peter Dinklage won the Emmy for best supporting
   actor for his role as Tyrion Lannister, beating his castmates Nikolaj
   Coster-Waldau and Alfie Allen in the category. Supporting actress went
   to Ozark's Julia Garner, who beat GOT's Gwendoline Christie, Lena
   Headey, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, and Killing Eve's Fiona Shaw.
   Kit Harington lost out in the Lead Actor category to Pose's Billy
   Porter, while Emilia Clarke lost out on Lead Actress to Killing Eve's

Death Stranding Gameplay: Kojima Gives a Tour of Sam's Private Room (Now in
English)

Customize gear, play music, plan your adventure, and so much more.

   At Tokyo Game Show 2019, Hideo Kojima showed off and discussed nearly
   35 minutes of Death Stranding
   see deal
   Death Stranding - PlayStation 4
   $59.99on Amazon
   gameplay that focused on Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges' private
   room, where Sam can customize his gear, play music, display figures,
   and even have nightmares. IGN has fully translated Kojima's gameplay
   commentary, which was previously only available in Japanese.

   Watch the video above to see the full gameplay demonstration, now with
   English subtitles.
   Last week, we broke down this demo that also reveals that if the camera
   lingers too much on Sam's crotch, he will punch said camera.
   This follows another 49-minute Death Stranding demo with Kojima
   commentary that IGN has also translated that focuses more on the
   open-world gameplay and giving fans an in-depth look of this much
   anticipated game in action. You can see the full video below!
   You can check out everything we learned about Death Stranding's
   gameplay from this TGS 2019 stream, as well as 105 details about Death
   Stranding that you might have missed.
   If that isn't enough, we've gathered every Death Stranding trailer and
   cinematic so far in one place to ensure you are up-to-date on
   everything revealed so far for the PlayStation 4 exclusive that will be
   released on November 8, 2019.

   Kojima has recently opened up a lot more about Death Stranding and
   explained how it is a metaphor for modern day society and that he
   believes more Death Stranding games are needed for his idea of a
   "Strand" genre to catch on.
   Death Standing stars Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and he is a delivery
   man of sorts that must help reunite the United States by connecting
   cities through the Chiral Network.
   Get straight to the action moments of the latest Death Stranding
   gameplay demo with the below video!

Minecraft Is Getting a Character Creator

   Minecraft
   $6.99on Amazon
   is introducing an in-game character creator that lets players customize
   their avatar's hairstyle, skin colour, and body shape.

   As announced in the Minecraft Beta's 1.13.0.15 patch notes, there'll be
   over 100 free customization items alongside extra accessories created
   by the development team available for purchase.

   The creator appears to be fairly detailed, with the notes promising
   options to design "body size and shape, limb replacement and tweaking
   of eyes, mouth, hairstyles and colours, facial hair and skin tones."
   Previously, custom skins created outside the game and imported in were
   the only way to personalise your avatar. That approach is still allowed
   in a "Classic Skins Tab" where players can upload them in the same way
   they did before.
   Check out Minecraft's enhanced lighting effects in the video above.
   Character creation will eventually roll out to Minecraft Earth, iOS,
   and Nintendo Switch, but for now it's only available in the Beta on
   Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android.
   Last month we got our first look at ray tracing in Minecraft, which is
   a rendering technique capable of creating incredibly realistic lighting
   effects. For Minecraft, that means reflections, god rays, and shadows
   across its blocky world.

BioWare Abandons Current Anthem Post-Launch Plans

Walking before running.

   Plans for more post-launch content in Anthem
   see deal
   Anthem - PlayStation 4
   $17.49on Amazon
   have been put on ice so the development team can focus on updates and
   thoroughly review core issues surrounding gameplay.

   Bioware's head of live service, Chad Robertson, announced the decision
   in a blog post that detailed some of the changes the development team
   had made to Anthem following player feedback. These include combat
   balancing, more reward crate types, and tips in load screens to better
   explain Cataclysm mechanics.
   See what we thought of Anthem when it launched back in February in our
   review video above.
   But he acknowledged that those tweaks weren't enough, saying, "We hear
   your concerns on core issues in Anthem and are acting on it. Those
   systems require a more thorough review and re-working versus quick
   fixes. We’ve got a team working on that now, and early results are
   promising.
   “In order to address these long-range plans, we are moving away from
   the Acts structure for updates,” Robertson continued. “Instead, we have
   additional seasonal updates planned for this year that we think players
   will enjoy. These events will deliver challenges and chases similar to
   what you’ve seen, and are built around some fun themes we’re bringing
   to the game.”
   Bioware first unveiled it's post-launch content plans back in February,
   and promised three separate Acts that would expand the world and what
   players could do within it. Anthem is set on an unstable, unnamed
   planet where natural disasters and hostile creatures must be safely
   navigated, and each Act was meant to go deeper into the story and
   "ongoing narrative" of the game's universe.

   The first Act was delayed beyond its initial March launch date as
   Bioware struggled to overcome technical teething issues following the
   game's full release. The first Cataclysm event is only just coming to a
   close over six months later, having been pushed out the door amid the
   departure of Anthem's lead producer Ben Irving for a new opportunity.
   In April, a report by Kotaku cited numerous sources from within the
   studio that recounted an unhealthy culture and technical issues with
   EA's Frostbite engine.
   Robertson promised to be transparent with fans in the future about
   what's coming down the pipeline, but said "I don’t have any news today
   to share about the long-term changes we are bringing to Anthem."

Apex Legends: New Hero Crypto Officially Announced, Season 3 Details Revealed

Tales from the Crypto.

   Matt Kim

   By Matt Kim

   Posted: 19 Sep 2019 5:59 pm

   Crypto has been rumored to be Apex Legends’ next hero for a long time,
   and today Respawn confirmed they’ll be entering the tournament when the
   next season drops on October 1.

   Respawn released a new Stories from the Outlands trailer today that
   sheds a little light on Crypto’s backstory. According to the video,
   Crypto was just your average, mild-mannered hacker who discovered some
   kind of match-rigging program developed for the Apex Legends
   tournament. When a mysterious organization catches onto Crypto, they
   hunt his friends and family down, forcing Crypto to go on the run.
   You can watch the Crypto cinematic below.
   While the video didn’t reveal how Crypto plays, he’s seen in the
   trailer as using some kind of drone to help escape from his pursuers.
   This drone could play into Crypto’s gameplay moveset in some way.
   Crypto is already technically in Apex Legends. Players can find Crypto
   loitering around the map, hacking into servers before running away. You
   can see a glimpse of him in our video below.
   Alongside Crypto Respawn announced some more details about the upcoming
   season in Apex Legends. Titled, “Meltdown,” Apex Legends season 3 will
   feature a new battle pass with over 100 items, a new Charger Rifle
   weapon, and a new Ranked season.
   Check out IGN’s Apex Legends review and Apex Legends wiki for our full
   coverage of Respawn’s battle royale shooter.

Valve Will Appeal French Courts on Alleged 'Anti-Consumer' Ban on Digital
Games Resale

Otherwise, Valve has three months to change its policies.

   French courts have just struck down several user agreement clauses for
   Valve’s online PC storefront, Steam, including restrictions on the
   resale of digital games. Valve has announced that it will appeal the
   court’s decision.

   As reported by French publication Numerama, French consumer advocacy
   group UFC Que Choisir announced a legal victory against Steam today.
   According to the report, the group successfully got the courts to
   cancel clauses within Steam the group claims were anti-consumer. This
   includes Valve's policy against reselling digital games purchased from
   Steam.
   “The most significant of those concerns [was] the one that forbade the
   resale of [digital] video games," it says in the Numerama report. "That
   means the products are not related to a particular physical medium (a
   cartridge or a disk, for example).”

   In a statement sent to IGN on the French court ruling, Valve says: “We
   disagree with the decision of the Paris Court of First Instance and
   will appeal it. The decision will have no effect on Steam while the
   case is on appeal.”
   The French court claims that Valve’s prohibition on reselling digital
   games is against European Union laws on digital goods, which promotes
   free movement of goods within the Union. This includes digital
   software. Although Valve was told it has three months to amend its
   policies, Valve’s appeal will put any immediate changes on hold.

   Death Stranding is one of 2019’s biggest video game releases, and the
   first game from Kojima Productions since founder Hideo Kojima split
   with Konami. Since announcing Death Stranding at Sony’s E3 2016 press
   conference, most of the materials released for the game have been
   cryptic, cinematic trailers.
   Aside from starring actor Norman Reedus as the main character Sam, we
   learned that Sam works as a delivery man who must help reunite the
   United States by connecting cities through something called the Chiral
   Network. Sam is literally “bridging” the country together, but there
   happen to be test-tube babies and mysterious supernatural elements in
   play also.
   But with just months to go before the full launch, Kojima has shown off
   much more of Death Stranding, including important plot points, gameplay
   mechanics, combat, world, and more. Despite this, there are still
   plenty of questions surrounding Death Stranding.
   Check out every action moment from the Death Stranding gameplay in the
   video below.
   However, IGN’s in-depth translations reveal (for English speakers) just
   exactly what Kojima was saying during his 49-minute long gameplay demo
   at this year’s Tokyo Game Show. So watch the video to find out exactly
   what Kojima’s thought processes were during the demonstration.
   Kojima has also been heavily discussing the game in the leadup to its
   launch, including discussing how Death Stranding is meant to mirror
   modern-day politics, and that more games like Death Stranding may be
   needed to help create the new strand genre that Kojima says Death
   Stranding is pioneering.
   Death Stranding is out on November 8, so make sure to check out IGN’s
   full coverage on Kojima’s latest cinematic journey.

   If you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the
   sale. For more, learn more.
