   I’ve wanted to dye my hair for, I don’t know, forever? It seemed like
   such a big deal, though, so I never did it! I’ve talked about it for
   years, but really wasn’t sure if I’d ever work up the courage to do it.

   So when the opportunity came along to work with Schwarzkopf® and their
   new line of Colorist Tools, I decided it was now or never.

   You guys.. I dyed my hair. And I survived. Not only that, I actually
   LOVE how it turned out. I wasn’t looking to do anything too drastic
   (especially because it was my first time), so I wanted something close
   to my normal hair, but a little bit richer and darker. Schwarzkopf​®
   Keratin Color truly is professional quality hair color at home that is
   easy to use and produces beautiful color results that last!…

   overpriced bouquet of…

Olivia Gwen {Birth Story}

   It’s been a while, huh? Well, I realized I never wrote the story of how
   my newest little monkey, Olivia, was born. Now that she’s over a year
   old, I figured it was time to document it (oops). This was my 4th
   pregnancy, and not as bad as some of the others. I was nauseous…

6 Fun Nerf Gun Contests

   About 2 years ago, I took a rare trip to the store without my kiddos. I
   was sick of the same old “watch a movie after the kids go to bed” date
   night Jonny and I had been having every. single. weekend. So I decided
   to be a little silly, and bought ourselves some Nerf guns….

FHE Assignment Board

   I love pretty much everything about being a mom, but the one thing that
   I hate more than anything? My kids getting hurt. I am a total wimp when
   it comes to blood and injuries, and I do NOT handle it well.  I knew it
   was just a matter of time before Owen ended up in…
