"As an experienced professional, I believe that passing on a little bit of
know-how is a way to pass on to young photographers what you have taken from
others "

- Patrick Zachmann

     *

   During this Berlin workshop with Patrick Zachmann, you will learn how
   to build a documentary reportage story, learning how to refine your
   storytelling technique through analysis. Patrick Zachmann will dedicate
   time to analysis of images, content, and editing. Most importantly, the
   workshop will help you to discover your own visual language as well as
   teach you the practical and conceptual know-how to approach
   photo-reporting.

   This will be a hands-on workshop with shooting sessions, individual
   assignments, daily group discussion and editing sessions.

   From September 29 to October 2, 2016 in Berlin.

   Magnum Photos was established during the golden age of editorial and
   print media; today press and media still remain at the heart of the
   agency’s activities and are a vital element for distributing work
   internationally.

   Magnum photographers are available for commissions from newspapers,
   magazines, digital platforms, and media clients worldwide, bringing
   their in-the-field experience and individual style of authorship to
   assignment work.

   Magnum also syndicates stories and personal work by photographers as
   features and for exclusive publication. The agency works with an
   extensive network of writers, fixers, researchers and filmmakers to
   supplement visual storytelling and provide multiple points of view. You
   can see a recent selection of work with media clients below, and if you
   are looking to commission, illustrate articles or feature stories, do
   not hesitate to get in touch: editorialteam@magnumphotos.com.
