NEWS IN THE NUMBERS

Growth in mobile news use driven by older adults

   By Kristine Lu

   Mobile devices have rapidly become one of the most common ways for
   Americans to get news, and the sharpest growth in the past year has
   been among Americans ages 50 and older, according to a Pew Research
   Center survey conducted in March.

   More than eight-in-ten U.S. adults now get news on a mobile device
   (85%), compared with 72% just a year ago and slightly more than half in
   2013 (54%). And the recent surge has come from older people: Roughly
   two-thirds of Americans ages 65 and older now get news on a mobile
   device (67%), a 24-percentage-point increase over the past year and
   about three times the share of four years ago, when less than a quarter
   of those 65 and older got news on mobile (22%).

   The strong growth carries through to those in the next-highest age
   bracket. Among 50- to 64-year-olds, 79% now get news on mobile, nearly
   double the share in 2013. The growth rate was much less steep – or
   nonexistent – for those younger than 50.

   Heightened adoption of mobile devices for news among older adults is
   due in part to the fact that they had considerably more room to grow
   than younger adults. Mobile news use, like internet use and mobile
   ownership in general, was already very high among younger adults,
   leaving little room for growth compared with older adults. For example,
   94% of both those ages 18 to 29 and 30 to 49 get news on mobile –
   unchanged since 2016 for 18- to 29-year-olds and only a 9-point rise
   for the 30-49 group. By contrast, among those ages 50 to 64 and those
   65 and older, increases of 16 and 24 points respectively in the past
   year have resulted in majorities in every age group now getting news on
   mobile. A recent Pew Research Center report similarly found a sharp
   rise in overall technology adoption among older Americans.

   Even though a large number of older adults are getting news on mobile
   devices, that doesn’t mean they prefer it. Across all adults, a clear
   majority of those who get news on both mobile devices and
   desktop/laptop computers prefer to get their news on mobile (65%). But
   those 65 and older are the only age group in which less than half
   prefer to do so: Only 44% prefer mobile, compared with about
   three-quarters of those 18 to 29 (77%), figures that have remained
   steady for both groups over the past year. In the next-highest age
   group, those 50 to 64, about half now prefer to get their news on
   mobile (54%), up from about four-in-ten (41%) a year ago.

   Large increases in mobile news use have also occurred among those with
   lower household incomes. About eight-in-ten adults with household
   incomes below $30,000 (79%) get news on mobile, double the portion of
   those who did so four years ago (37%). Even so, this is still lower
   than those with higher household incomes: About nine-in-ten of those
   with household incomes of $30,000 or more now get news on a mobile
   device.

   The other major digital platform for news is the desktop or laptop
   computer. Here, the 85% of all adults who ever get news on a computer
   is about the same portion that did so in 2013 (82%), with small or no
   significant changes by age or income from 2013 levels.

Growth in mobile news use driven by older adults

   By Kristine Lu

   Mobile devices have rapidly become one of the most common ways for
   Americans to get news, and the sharpest growth in the past year has
   been among Americans ages 50 and older, according to a Pew Research
   Center survey conducted in March.

   More than eight-in-ten U.S. adults now get news on a mobile device
   (85%), compared with 72% just a year ago and slightly more than half in
   2013 (54%). And the recent surge has come from older people: Roughly
   two-thirds of Americans ages 65 and older now get news on a mobile
   device (67%), a 24-percentage-point increase over the past year and
   about three times the share of four years ago, when less than a quarter
   of those 65 and older got news on mobile (22%).

   The strong growth carries through to those in the next-highest age
   bracket. Among 50- to 64-year-olds, 79% now get news on mobile, nearly
   double the share in 2013. The growth rate was much less steep – or
   nonexistent – for those younger than 50.

   Heightened adoption of mobile devices for news among older adults is
   due in part to the fact that they had considerably more room to grow
   than younger adults. Mobile news use, like internet use and mobile
   ownership in general, was already very high among younger adults,
   leaving little room for growth compared with older adults. For example,
   94% of both those ages 18 to 29 and 30 to 49 get news on mobile –
   unchanged since 2016 for 18- to 29-year-olds and only a 9-point rise
   for the 30-49 group. By contrast, among those ages 50 to 64 and those
   65 and older, increases of 16 and 24 points respectively in the past
   year have resulted in majorities in every age group now getting news on
   mobile. A recent Pew Research Center report similarly found a sharp
   rise in overall technology adoption among older Americans.

   Even though a large number of older adults are getting news on mobile
   devices, that doesn’t mean they prefer it. Across all adults, a clear
   majority of those who get news on both mobile devices and
   desktop/laptop computers prefer to get their news on mobile (65%). But
   those 65 and older are the only age group in which less than half
   prefer to do so: Only 44% prefer mobile, compared with about
   three-quarters of those 18 to 29 (77%), figures that have remained
   steady for both groups over the past year. In the next-highest age
   group, those 50 to 64, about half now prefer to get their news on
   mobile (54%), up from about four-in-ten (41%) a year ago.

   Large increases in mobile news use have also occurred among those with
   lower household incomes. About eight-in-ten adults with household
   incomes below $30,000 (79%) get news on mobile, double the portion of
   those who did so four years ago (37%). Even so, this is still lower
   than those with higher household incomes: About nine-in-ten of those
   with household incomes of $30,000 or more now get news on a mobile
   device.

   The other major digital platform for news is the desktop or laptop
   computer. Here, the 85% of all adults who ever get news on a computer
   is about the same portion that did so in 2013 (82%), with small or no
   significant changes by age or income from 2013 levels.

   incomes below $30,000 (79%) get news on mobile, double the portion of
   those who did so four years ago (37%). Even so, this is still lower
   than those with higher household incomes: About nine-in-ten of those
   with household incomes of $30,000 or more now get news on a mobile
   device.

   The other major digital platform for news is the desktop or laptop
   computer. Here, the 85% of all adults who ever get news on a computer
   is about the same portion that did so in 2013 (82%), with small or no
   significant changes by age or income from 2013 levels.

NEWS IN THE NUMBERS

   June 12, 2017

Growth in mobile news use driven by older adults

   By Kristine Lu

   Mobile devices have rapidly become one of the most common ways for
   Americans to get news, and the sharpest growth in the past year has
   been among Americans ages 50 and older, according to a Pew Research
   Center survey conducted in March.

   More than eight-in-ten U.S. adults now get news on a mobile device
   (85%), compared with 72% just a year ago and slightly more than half in
   2013 (54%). And the recent surge has come from older people: Roughly
   two-thirds of Americans ages 65 and older now get news on a mobile
   device (67%), a 24-percentage-point increase over the past year and
   about three times the share of four years ago, when less than a quarter
   of those 65 and older got news on mobile (22%).

   The strong growth carries through to those in the next-highest age
   bracket. Among 50- to 64-year-olds, 79% now get news on mobile, nearly
   double the share in 2013. The growth rate was much less steep – or
   nonexistent – for those younger than 50.

   Heightened adoption of mobile devices for news among older adults is
   due in part to the fact that they had considerably more room to grow
   than younger adults. Mobile news use, like internet use and mobile
   ownership in general, was already very high among younger adults,
   leaving little room for growth compared with older adults. For example,
   94% of both those ages 18 to 29 and 30 to 49 get news on mobile –
   unchanged since 2016 for 18- to 29-year-olds and only a 9-point rise
   for the 30-49 group. By contrast, among those ages 50 to 64 and those
   65 and older, increases of 16 and 24 points respectively in the past
   year have resulted in majorities in every age group now getting news on
   mobile. A recent Pew Research Center report similarly found a sharp
   rise in overall technology adoption among older Americans.

   Even though a large number of older adults are getting news on mobile
   devices, that doesn’t mean they prefer it. Across all adults, a clear
   majority of those who get news on both mobile devices and
   desktop/laptop computers prefer to get their news on mobile (65%). But
   those 65 and older are the only age group in which less than half
   prefer to do so: Only 44% prefer mobile, compared with about
   three-quarters of those 18 to 29 (77%), figures that have remained
   steady for both groups over the past year. In the next-highest age
   group, those 50 to 64, about half now prefer to get their news on
   mobile (54%), up from about four-in-ten (41%) a year ago.

   Large increases in mobile news use have also occurred among those with
   lower household incomes. About eight-in-ten adults with household
   incomes below $30,000 (79%) get news on mobile, double the portion of
   those who did so four years ago (37%). Even so, this is still lower
   than those with higher household incomes: About nine-in-ten of those
   with household incomes of $30,000 or more now get news on a mobile
   device.

   The other major digital platform for news is the desktop or laptop
   computer. Here, the 85% of all adults who ever get news on a computer
   is about the same portion that did so in 2013 (82%), with small or no
   significant changes by age or income from 2013 levels.

Facts on Hispanics of Peruvian origin in the United States, 2017

   By Luis Noe-Bustamante, Antonio Flores and Sono Shah

   An estimated 679,000 Hispanics of Peruvian origin lived in the United
   States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S.
   Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Peruvians in this
   statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of
   Peruvian origin; this includes immigrants from Peru and those who trace
   their family ancestry to Peru.

   Peruvians are the 11th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in
   the United States, accounting for about 1% of the U.S. Hispanic
   population in 2017. Since 2000, the Peruvian-origin population has
   increased 174%, growing from 248,000 to 679,000 over the period. At the
   same time, the Peruvian foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew
   by 120%, from 193,000 in 2000 to 423,000 in 2017. By comparison,
   Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6
   million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.

   Year Foreign born U.S. born
   2000 193,000      56,000
   2010 406,000      204,000

   2017 423,000      256,000

   Pew Research Center


   This statistical profile compares the demographic and economic
   characteristics of the Peruvian-origin population in the U.S. with the
   characteristics of U.S. Hispanics and the U.S. population overall. It
   is based on Pew Research Center tabulations of the 2017 American
   Community Survey. Key facts include:

Immigration status

     * Among Hispanics in the U.S., about 33% are foreign born, compared
       with 62% of U.S. Peruvians.
     * About 46% of foreign-born Peruvians have been in the U.S. for over
       20 years, and 58% of foreign-born Peruvians are U.S. citizens.


Educational attainment

     * About 16% of U.S. Hispanics ages 25 and older have obtained at
       least a bachelor’s degree, compared with 32% of Peruvians.
     * Among Peruvians ages 25 and older, the U.S. born are more likely
       than the foreign-born to have a bachelor’s degree or higher (44%
       vs. 30%).


Income

     * Among U.S. Hispanics, the median annual personal earnings for those
       ages 16 and older was $25,000, compared with $30,000 for Peruvians.
     * Looking at full-time, year-round workers, U.S. Hispanics earned
       less than Peruvians ($34,000 vs. $40,000).


Poverty status

     * The share of U.S. Hispanics who live in poverty (19%) is greater
       than among Peruvians (11%).
     * About 10% of U.S.-born Peruvians live in poverty, as do 11% of
       foreign-born Peruvians.


Homeownership

     * The rate of homeownership among U.S. Hispanics is 47% compared with
       51% for Peruvians.
     * Among Peruvians in the U.S., rates of homeownership are similar for
       the U.S. born and the foreign born (50% vs. 51%).


Top states of residence

     * The Peruvian population is concentrated in Florida (19%),
       California (16%) and New Jersey (14%).


Age

     * The median age of U.S. Hispanics (29) is lower than that of
       Peruvians (38) and the U.S. population (38).


Marital status

     * U.S. Hispanics ages 18 and older are less likely to be married
       (46%) than Peruvians (51%).
     * Among Peruvians ages 18 and older, those who are foreign born are
       more likely to be married than the U.S. born (57% vs. 29%).


Fertility

     * Some 7% of U.S. Hispanic women ages 15 to 44 gave birth in the 12
       months prior to the July 2017 American Community Survey. That rate
       for Peruvian women was 5%.


Language

     * About 70% of U.S. Hispanics ages 5 and older speak only English at
       home or speak English at least “very well,” compared with 64% of
       Peruvians.
     * Similarly, 64% of Hispanic adults are English proficient, as are
       58% of Peruvian adults.

Methodology

   Pew Research Center’s fact sheets on U.S. Latinos and the accompanying
   blog post examine the Latino population of the United States overall
   and by its 15 largest origin groups — Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
   Salvadorans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Hondurans,
   Spaniards, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Argentines
   and Panamanians. These sheets provide detailed geographic, demographic
   and economic characteristics for all Latinos and for each Latino origin
   group. They are based on Pew Research Center tabulations of the U.S.
   Census Bureau’s 2010, 2015 and 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) and
   the 2000 U.S. decennial census.

   The ACS is the largest household survey in the United States, with a
   sample of more than 3 million addresses. It covers the topics
   previously covered in the long form of the decennial census. The ACS is
   designed to provide estimates of the size and characteristics of the
   resident population, which includes persons living in households and
   group quarters. For more details about the ACS, including the sampling
   strategy and associated error, see the 2010, 2015 or 2017 American
   Community Survey’s Accuracy Statement provided by the U.S. Census
   Bureau.

   The specific data sources for these fact sheets are the 1% samples of
   the 2010, 2015 and 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) Integrated
   Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) provided by the University of
   Minnesota and the 5% sample of the 2000 decennial census. IPUMS assigns
   uniform codes, to the extent possible, to data collected by the
   decennial census and the ACS from 1850 to 2017. For more information
   about IPUMS, including variable definition and sampling error, please
   visit the “IPUMS Documentation and User Guide.”

   Due to differences in the way in which IPUMS and Census Bureau adjust
   income data and assign poverty status, data provided on these topics
   might differ from data that are provided by the Census Bureau.

   For the purposes of these fact sheets, the foreign born include those
   persons who identified as naturalized citizens or non-citizens and are
   living in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Persons born in
   Puerto Rico and other outlying territories of the U.S. and who are now
   living in the 50 states or the District of Columbia are included in the
   U.S.-born population.

NEWS IN THE NUMBERS

   April 21, 2009

A Bare Majority of Protestants

   By Russell Heimlich

   The United States is on the verge of becoming a minority Protestant
   country; the number of Americans who report that they are members of
   Protestant denominations now stands at 51%. Moreover, the Protestant
   population is characterized by significant internal diversity and
   fragmentation, encompassing hundreds of different denominations loosely
   grouped around three fairly distinct religious traditions — evangelical
   Protestant churches (26.3% of the overall adult population), mainline
   Protestant churches (18.1%) and historically black Protestant churches
   (6.9%). While Americans who are unaffiliated with any particular
   religion have seen the greatest growth in numbers as a result of
   changes in affiliation, Catholicism has experienced the greatest net
   losses as a result of affiliation changes. While nearly one-in-three
   Americans (31%) were raised in the Catholic faith, today fewer than
   one-in-four (24%) describe themselves as Catholic. These losses would
   have been even more pronounced were it not for the offsetting impact of
   immigration. The 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey finds that among
   the foreign-born adult population, Catholics outnumber Protestants by
   nearly a two-to-one margin (46% Catholic vs. 24% Protestant); among
   native-born Americans, on the other hand, Protestants outnumber
   Catholics by an even larger margin (55% Protestant vs. 21% Catholic).
