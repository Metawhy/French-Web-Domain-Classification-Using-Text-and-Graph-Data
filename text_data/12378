   Do you like green bean casserole?

   Some do, some don’t.

   It has never been my favorite. Until now.

   This green bean casserole is the ultimate!

   The. Best. Ever.

   The bomb. Shall I go on? :)

   That’s why I named it “Not Yo’ Mamma’s Green Bean Casserole.” It’s
   nothing like the traditional recipes that we’ve all grown to love (or
   not). ;)

   No canned “cream of anything” is used. It’s cheesy, and your house will
   smell divine!

Not Yo’ Mamma’s Green Bean Casserole

   3 tablespoons butter
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
   1 teaspoon salt
   1 teaspoon white sugar
   1/4 cup onion, diced
   1 cup sour cream
   4 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained
   2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
   1 pkg French fried onions

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
   Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
   flour until smooth, and cook for one minute. (Do not overcook, because
   the flour will burn.) Stir in the salt, sugar, onion. Sauté until the
   onion is tender, about one minute.  Stir in sour cream and remove from
   heat. Add green beans, and stir to coat.
   Transfer the mixture to a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Spread shredded
   cheese over the top.
   Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Add French fried
   onions to the top of cheese and bake for 10-15 minutes until golden
   brown.

   I don’t even know where I got this recipe, but I’ve been making it for
   several years.

   My mother-in-law asks me to bring this green bean casserole every year
   for Thanksgiving. :)

   Enjoy! :)
