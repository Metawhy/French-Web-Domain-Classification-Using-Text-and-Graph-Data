Voice assistant devices and children

   1

   New voice controlled devices like the Google Home or Amazon Echo are
   becoming hugely popular. As Google have just released the next
   iteration of these devices – the Google Home Hub – we thought we’d take
   a look at how parents and caretakers can enjoy the convenience of a
   voice assistant without worrying about the children in their care being
   exposed to anything dangerous or explicit.

Voice controlled devices

   As the Google Home and Amazon Echo work via voice commands, there is no
   lock. The devices are designed for quick, off-the-cuff searches and
   queries – Google and Amazon want to put as little in between you and
   using their service so they can collect more data on you – so a lock
   would defeat the purpose. That means, when plugged in and turned on,
   your device can be used by anyone in the home.

   While there’s no lock, there’s also no screen, camera or keyboard on
   these smart speakers (with the exception of Google’s new Google Home
   Hub), so the threats are minimal in comparison to other devices like
   smartphones or laptops. However, there are still certain risks –
   especially with younger children around – that children may be exposed
   to explicit materials that can be delivered through a speaker.

What are the risks?

   These devices can be connected to a wide range of apps. For example,
   the Google Home connects to countless smart home, audio, video and
   streaming services including Netflix, Spotify and more. This means, if
   connected to your accounts, the children in your care may be able
   request explicit and inappropriate songs and other media to be played.

   Some devices also support the ability to shop online, allowing you
   (read: anyone in your home, including parrots) to place orders through
   your Amazon account. This can be a dangerous feature to have enabled
   around children who might not yet understand rules around making
   purchases.

   Despite this, it’s hard to find too much to worry about with these
   smart speakers. In fact, knowing that these devices are made to be
   readily available for the whole family to use, Google and Amazon have
   put a lot of effort into ensuring that they’re safe.

Childsafe filters and devices – do they work?

   Amazon have released their own version of the Amazon Echo, specifically
   designed for children. (Interestingly enough, The Washington Post wrote
   an article claiming that Mattel’s version of ‘a smart assistant for
   children’ ‘drew privacy concerns’. The Washington Post is owned by Jeff
   Bezos, who also owns Amazon).

   The Echo Dot Kids is a version of the Echo Dot which is designed to
   integrate seamlessly with child friendly services, and comes in a more
   rugged case to safeguard it from potential rough play. However, it’s
   not without its faults. A quick browse of the reviews on the seller
   page show that this device evidently has some creases still left to
   iron.

   Google, on the other hand, decided to release a designated application
   for families to ensure that they can use their suite of devices and
   services safely.

   Family Link is Google’s answer to unlocked home devices (and other apps
   and hardware they have created). However, while useful, this app does
   not block all inappropriate content. Instead, it allows parents to
   watch and monitor the activity of their children once their accounts
   have been linked.

   This adds a level of transparency for parents, but does not protect the
   children in their care. Instead, we would recommend a service such as
   Family Zone, which can block inappropriate content).

Turning off explicit content and purchases

   Google Home, does let you turn off restricted content if you have young
   people in the house – you can find all the instructions here – however,
   this only works for Google owned media services, like Google Music, or
   YouTube. (Any other services that Google Home connects to, such as
   Spotify, or Pandora, will need to have their content filters set in the
   apps themselves).

   Amazon has similar controls for their devices, and if you do decide to
   buy an Echo, you should definitely switch on the ‘explicit filter’.

   As for purchases, things are a little more simple. In Amazon’s ‘Alexa’
   app, you can simply turn off voice purchases altogether – or set a PIN
   that will be required for all purchases.

   In the Google Home app, head to the Payments section, then turn off
   ‘Pay with Your Assistant’.

The Internet Safe Education Verdict

   These devices are often advertised to be perfectly child safe. For
   example, this introductory ad from Amazon, which is literally narrated
   by a child as she watches in awe as they welcome an Echo into the
   family:

   ﻿


   It’s also quite obvious that these companies are working very hard to
   ensure the devices are family friendly. And though they’re not quite
   perfect yet, in our opinion, they’re a lot less dangerous for children
   than their own smartphone or other device.

   As long as you remember to set some limitations with your children and
   let them know what is and isn’t appropriate, your voice assistant could
   turn out to be a very practical addition to your home.

FACILITATORS

   The unique quality and aspects of Internet Safe Education’s approach
   are a result of the experience of former detective Brett Lee who worked
   as a Queensland Police Officer for 22 years, 16 of which as a detective
   in the field of Child Exploitation. Brett has been personally involved
   with the interview, location, arrest and prosecution of hundreds of
   online criminals and predators. Nobody else in Australia can offer
   programs with this level of credibility or insight whereby the learning
   outcomes can not be denied.

   Ross Pascoe has more than 20 years experience in emergency services,
   law enforcement, investigation and training. These include 6 years as
   crew chief / chief training officer of the Westpac LifeSaver Rescue
   Helicopter and 19 years in the Queensland Police Service, currently at
   the rank of Acting Senior Sergeant.

   20 years law enforcement background investigating a range of incidents,
   including child abuse investigations. My interests have shifted from
   investigation to education. I am able to transfer the knowledge gained
   by providing awareness training to people young and old, empowering
   them with the confidence to make safe personal decisions in the real
   world and online.
