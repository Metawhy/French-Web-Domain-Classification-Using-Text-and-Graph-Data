Fire: Friend or foe? An exhibition to discover the stakes of fire control.


   Mastering fire has been of fundamental importance for humanity,
   profoundly transforming our everyday lives and psychology. Our
   relationship with fire has evolved over time, yet even today it
   oscillates between fear and fascination. Fire evokes vitality,
   conviviality, progress and techniques but also danger and destruction.
     * Taming and using fire: from prehistoric times to today. Fire has
       been depicted by countless myths and symbols, as it is a tool at
       the service of man and industry.

     * Understanding fire and research issues: Through chemistry, observe
       the physics of combustion and flames or the ecology of a forest
       fire. Discover the challenges of current research and perspectives.

     * Protecting and defending oneself from fire: Synonymous with danger
       and destruction, fire can destroy as quickly as it can create.
       Learn about the tools used to fight it, and how to better prevent
       fires and protect oneself.

Pasteur

     *   Pasteur, the experimenter!
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *

Understand the logic of discoveries and measure the scope of Pasteur's
inventions, both scholarly and innovative.


   Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) is one of the heroes of history. For a French
   scientist, his international reputation is almost unparalleled.
   Following exhibits on Leonardo da Vinci and Charles Darwin,
   Universcience continues its dedication to the cultural history of
   science and technology,with the Pasteur exhibit.

   Physics and chemistry, biology and microbiology, agri-food, animal and
   human health... Pasteur has accompanied the movement to modernize the
   Century of Wonders. Along with others, he has opened the doors to a
   microscopic world, populated by the best and the worst. He has created
   new disciplines, programs and research methods.

   The interactive exhibition will inform the visitor about Pasteur's
   career path, his numerous fields of research, his talent as an
   experimenter, but will also reveal his relationship with art,
   techniques and industry.
   For Pasteur is an innovator as much as he is a scholar. This narrative,
   renewed in the light of recent scientific and technical advances, will
   also present the facts and the protagonists who have remained in the
   shadows. To approach such a figure will be an opportunity to understand
   how science is done, and why this scientist has become, in France and
   elsewhere, a myth and the equal of a Victor Hugo.

   Today, it is difficult to imagine what cinema would be like without
   special effects. Action, science fiction, animation or comedy:  the
   most popular and successful movies rely largely on special effects.
   However, do we really know what goes on behind the scenes? What is
   hiding behind the magic of these great movies?

   The exhibition introduces visitors to the stages of conception and
   creation of special effects in cinema. At the entrance, visitors obtain
   a QR wristband, which allows them to record themselves as they move
   through the interactive displays. The exhibition consists of 5 parts:

   The office: how are special effects brainstormed? From pre-production
   to storyboarding, the preparatory work.

   The set: how are special effects created? Green-screen compositing,
   motion capture, make-up, staging, animation, and tricks…

   The studio: what happens after shooting? Landscape, crowds, explosions,
   digital doubles, and invisible effects…The possibilities of modifying
   images are endless!

   The movie theater: do special effects change the way the audience
   watches cinema? What role do they play today? What is the future of
   cinema screenings?

   Trailers: using their QR wristbands, visitors create their own trailers
   with recordings made during their visit.

Why and how do we transform cities? How does this change our lifestyle?

   How can we improve life in cities? Energy resources, climate,
   demographic growth and new uses...
   The city of tomorrow is at the heart of global issues. It must adapt to
   changes in society.Though there are many possible initiatives that
   could ameliorate our cities, one concept prevails: sharing.
   “Thinking city” is no longer the responsibility of specialists, but
   something that concerns all city dwellers as they make everyday choices
     * CITIES UNDER PRESSURE explores the complexity of urban systems:
       constant population growth, shared living spaces, digitalization,
       traffic, infrastructures and environment. A special hands-on
       exhibit questions visitors on their own urban practices, and the
       responses contribute to enriching the exhibition in real time.
     * URBAN EARTH is an immersive audiovisual show. This trip around the
       planet analyses data coming from London, Sydney, Tokyo, New York,
       Shanghai, Dubai, Cairo, São Paulo... (This show won the Kantar
       Information is Beautiful Awards 2016).
     * URBAN FUTURES presents a global overview of initiatives and
       innovations developed by representatives, manufacturers, urban
       planners and citizens to respond to the challenge of urbanization.
       The goal of these projects? To open up the city, to improve the
       environment, and to secure, sustain, and share the wonders of urban
       life.




The exhibition was designed in collaboration with the Singapore Science
Centre

   A collaboration between Universcience and Inrap, this exhibition gives
   light to an era that covers over 1,000 years. Visitors will learn that
   the compass and eyeglasses were invented in the Middle Ages, as well as
   the term banlieue (suburbs), urban planning, and industry as we know
   it. The exhibit provides a complete review of the medieval era, a
   period that still holds many hidden treasures.

   What's new in the Middle Ages? presents a review of the knowledge
   acquired by researchers and historians during recent archeological
   digs. It depicts the technical and social innovations techniques that
   punctuated this period and their impact on the life of the population.

   The exhibition is comprised of six thematic sections, which offer
   timelines, models, maps, interactive objects, games, videos and
   multimedia.

   Discover the Middle Ages like they have never been seen before!
