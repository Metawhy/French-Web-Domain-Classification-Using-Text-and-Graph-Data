About the Liberated Pixel Cup

   Liberated Pixel Cup is a two-part competition: make a bunch of awesome
   free culture licensed artwork, and then program a bunch of free
   software games that use it.

   Liberated Pixel Cup brings together some powerful allies: Creative
   Commons, Mozilla, OpenGameArt, the Free Software Foundation, and you.

The artwork

   Phase one of the competition is to build a set of artwork that's dual
   licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 and GPLv3 and stylistically consistent.  To
   that end, have created a style guide which incorporates these
   components.

   Screenshot

   As you can see, for this competition we're working on an overhead 16
   bit rpg inspired style (technically: front-facing overhead orthographic
   view) with 32x32 tiles.  The selection of this style is intentional:
   we're trying to build something easy to collaborate upon on which a
   wide variety of games (overhead shooters, RPGs, adventure games,
   strategy games) can be built.

   When the competition began on June 1st, artists were asked to make
   artwork that matches this existing style and upload to OpenGameArt.org
   under the forementioned licenses.  These entries are now archived here.
   Winners will be selected on judgements of quality, how well they match
   the style guide, etc.  Phase one runs from June 1st thru June 30th. For
   more information, check out the rules.

The games

   Phase two of this competition will be building GPLv3 or later games
   that incorporate artwork from the artwork building phase of the
   project.  People can work in teams or individually.  Participants will
   be judged based on fun factor, innovativeness, and of course how well
   they incorporate assets built for the contest. Phase two runs from July
   1st thru July 31st.

   Please note that for a game to qualify as a contest entry, it must
   compile and run on 100% free (as in freedom) software from the ground
   up.

You!

   Liberated Pixel Cup will be awesome, but it can't happen without the
   help of people like you!

   We're paying artists for comissions on the artwork for the initial
   style guide, and we'd like to give away prizes for those who win the
   competition.  You can help make this project all the more awesome with
   your donation!

   This competition also needs people like you to enter and do awesome
   things with it.  Interested in taking part?  Read up more here and join
   us at #liberatedpixelcup on irc.freenode.net (click here to chat from
   your browser)! The admins and judges can be reached for questions on
   the official forum as well.
