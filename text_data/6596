   This past weekend 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year Industrial and Interaction
   Design Majors went to the IDSA (Industrial Design Society of America)
   Northeast District Conference in Providence, Rhode Island. The IDSA
   student chapter organized the carpools and hotels that SU students
   stayed at. My thesis professor, Ralf Schneider, attended the conference
   with us!

   The theme of the conference was the “Unexpected Conference”. It was
   about how designers need to be prepared to expect anything that happen
   (aka expect the unexpected!) The two day conference featured design
   professionals, speakers, portfolio reviews, and networking
   opportunities.

   One of the main components to the conference is the student merit
   award. Each school selects a student to present for the merit award and
   to become the Northeast District winner and present at the
   international IDSA conference. Syracuse University selected 5th year
   Alex Rausch and she presented her portfolio at the event. She was up
   against eleven different students from schools such as Pratt, Parsons,
   MassArt, Philadelphia University, RIT, RISD, Drexel and Wentworth
   Institute of Technology.

   Hey guys! My name is Anju Cloud, and I am a freshman Musical Theater
   Major in the Department of Drama. I just recently joined this wonderful
   and bubbly group of SU:VPA Ambassadors, and I am excited to share with

   introduce myself in the way all of us Freshman had to, to become part
   of the Drama Department family.

   HI! My name is Anju Cloud!

   Fletchall poses with his “Let Us Continue” Mural outside of The Nancy
   Cantor Warehouse (The Design School)

   Name: Quinton Fletchall

   Education:  Syracuse University - BID Industrial and Interaction
   Design 2013 / MA Communication and Rhetorical Studies 2015

   Experience:  Previously worked for Syracuse’s The Connective Corridor
   and currently works as a Design Researcher in Chicago.

The Connective Corridor bus route connects Syracuse University’s Main Campus
to The Nancy Cantor Warehouse in Downtown Syracuse.  The free bus allows
students, faculty and community members the opportunity to explore Downtown
Syracuse.  While working at The Connective Corridor, Fletchall designed a
series of bus wraps for the bus.

   image

   (Above) The bus wrap that Fletchall designed

   Tiffany: The new bus wraps are very different than the old ones that
   have been on the buses for a few years.  What are the reasons that you
   decided to design the wraps this way?

   Quinton: First, they were designed by Nathan Li, former VPA faculty. I
   only assisted Nathan. We started by listening to some feedback from
   riders. Some students, not yet familiar with Syracuse, were unsure
   about where the bus would take them and were afraid of getting lost. So
   we knew we wanted the design to address this. One solution was making
   the buses bold and easy to spot but also include some of the main
   locations the bus travels to on the exterior.

   T: Working with Nathan, what was the process that you went through to
   create them?

   Q: Nathan and I developed multiple sketches before settling on the
   design you see.

   T: Finally, where did you and Nathan get the inspiration for the wraps?

   Q:Nathan took inspiration from some posters and graphic designers he
   was familiar with. Once we had our style we started developing the
   icons that help tell move about the locations the bus goes to.

Designers go to Google

   SU:VPA School of Design sent out an email in January about an
   opportunity to attend a UX Portfolio Workshop at Google Headquarters in
   NYC.  The opportunity was only given to 25 students in the School of
   Design. I was fortunate to be selected as one of the 25 students
   allowed to go.

   The Google UX Portfolio Workshop was on Saturday from 9:30 - 4:00 p.m.
    The workshop consisted of a UX Design Manager and a Sr. Visual
   Designer who both work for Google.  When we arrived we got a tour of
   Google Headquarters and then started with presentations and workshops
   to enhance our portfolios.

   As someone who wants to go into UX and Visual Design as a career path
   after I graduate in May, I was excited that I was able to learn what
   Designers in the “real world” do.  They both gave excellent feedback
   from a new perspective on my portfolio.

   This past weekend 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year Industrial and Interaction
   Design Majors went to the IDSA (Industrial Design Society of America)
   Northeast District Conference in Providence, Rhode Island. The IDSA
   student chapter organized the carpools and hotels that SU students
   stayed at. My thesis professor, Ralf Schneider, attended the conference
   with us!

   The theme of the conference was the “Unexpected Conference”. It was
   about how designers need to be prepared to expect anything that happen
   (aka expect the unexpected!) The two day conference featured design
   professionals, speakers, portfolio reviews, and networking
   opportunities.

   One of the main components to the conference is the student merit
   award. Each school selects a student to present for the merit award and
   to become the Northeast District winner and present at the
   international IDSA conference. Syracuse University selected 5th year
   Alex Rausch and she presented her portfolio at the event. She was up
   against eleven different students from schools such as Pratt, Parsons,
   MassArt, Philadelphia University, RIT, RISD, Drexel and Wentworth
   Institute of Technology.

   They taught us original choreography from the show and answered all of
