“I would strongly recommend PROFILES IN HISTORY to anyone who wants
professional and thoroughly competent representation. In all honesty, my
experience was completely positive. Everyone made money and left with smiles
on their faces. This is the way business should be done.”

   DOCDAVE WINIEWICZ, 2015

“I evaluated a number of auction houses to handle the sale of my WWI and WWII
poster collection, and I chose Profiles in History because of the excellent
catalogs, their fine record in historical manuscript and film poster
auctions, and the strong recommendations from friends who have been clients.
 The results exceeded my expectations.”
