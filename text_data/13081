   Celestine is an Eastern Mediterranean restaurant and events venue
   located on the DUMBO waterfront in Brooklyn. Located just under the
   Manhattan Bridge, the restaurant offers unparalleled views of the
   downtown city skyline. Executive Chef Garett McMahan serves seasonal,
   soulful fare that draws inspiration from the Mediterranean coastline,
   Northern Africa, and the Middle East.

   This focus is mirrored in our wine list which highlights small coastal
   Mediterranean producers. Our bar program similarly marries the flavors
   of the spice route with classic cocktails. We are proud to be located
   within a LEED Gold Certified building and to be a part of the DUMBO
   community.
