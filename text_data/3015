How Australia is shaking up the truffle market

   visitors to join him on his truffle hunts

   When his dogs sniff out a prized black truffle under the soil, Nigel
   Wood says it is always an exciting moment for the accompanying humans
   too.

   "The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation
   and curiosity," he says.

   If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the
   expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs
   going through woodlands in France or Italy.

   Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for
   centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined
   by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's
   fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the
   French black or périgord.

   Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle
   Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in
   another decade's time the country could take the number one position.

   introduced to Australia in the 1990s

   While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given
   the secrecy that surrounds the "diamonds in the dirt", Australia is
   expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this
   year.

   This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30
   tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry
   experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production
   figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports
   périgords from Spain that then become "French".)

   What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very
   lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants,
   they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg.

   Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in
   the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To
   cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut
   saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with
   the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to
   harvest the resulting black truffles.

   item

   As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season
   in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder
   and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says
   this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are
   selling their crop when they are none available from Europe.

   "Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have
   any competitors," he says. "We produce truffles in the southern
   hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere."

   Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means
   that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can
   now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and
   summer.

   "We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to
   match the demand from overseas," says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The
   Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or
   truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the
   southern hemisphere.

   "We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop,"
   he says.
   Image copyright Truffle Melbourne

   Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has
   ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to
   allow expansion of the truffière.

   While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup,
   produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are
   now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected
   to grow.

   Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers
   Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce
   good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the
   desired alkaline levels.

   Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is
   "leaps and bounds ahead" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in
   South Africa, and countries in South America. "Australia has a
   multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are
   still finding their feet," he adds.

   Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is
   also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe,
   the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy
   scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around
   education and raising the profile of truffles.

   "If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most
   would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate," says Barrett.
   "Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are
   inquisitive as to how they're grown and used."

Global Trade

   trade:

     * How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies
     * Should I offset my summer holiday flights?
     * Would you drink camel milk?
     * Why blue jeans are going green

   French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer
   awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central
   business district.

   "During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much
   of our menu and people ask for it," he says. "If you look around
   Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout
   winter and they're so popular they sell out.

   "There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them
   and people want to enjoy them."

   To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock,
   helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne.

   Image caption There is even a growing trend of adding truffles to sweet
   dishes, such as this plate of churros donuts

   And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter
   welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious
   crop.

   "On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth
   before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle," he
   says. "People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle
   they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about."

   Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: "There is good
   reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest
   producer of black truffles within the decade.

   "Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their
   production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and
   medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is
   usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently
   some large farms have also been established."

Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?

   By Tom Edgington BBC Reality Check
     * 11 September 2019

   replaced Liam Fox

   The European Union (EU) has about 40 free trade deals, covering more
   than 70 countries. That means the UK, as a member of the EU, can
   currently trade with countries like Canada without having to pay taxes
   on imports (tariffs) on most goods.

   In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would suddenly lose
   tariff-free access to these markets and it would have to trade under
   World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

   To avoid this, the UK government is in the process of rolling over the
   EU's existing free trade deals with other countries - worth about 11%
   of total UK trade. The UK says it wants to replicate the EU's trade
   agreements "as far as possible" and have them ready to go in the event
   of a no-deal Brexit.

   If Brexit happens on 31 October, the UK will be free to negotiate and
   sign trade deals with countries where the EU has no trade agreement -
   such the US. However, the UK will also need to negotiate a free trade
   deal with the EU to ensure continued tariff-free access to its market.

   Last year, the EU accounted for 46% of UK exports, while the US
   accounted for 19%.

How many deals have been rolled over?

   So far, the UK has signed 13 "continuity" deals covering 38 countries
   or territories.
     * South Korea (signed 22 August)
     * Central America (18 July)
     * Andean countries (15 May)
     * Norway and Iceland (2 April)
     * Caribbean countries (22 March)
     * Pacific Islands (14 March)
     * Liechtenstein (28 February)
     * Israel (18 February)
     * Palestinian Authority (18 February)
     * Switzerland (11 February)
     * The Faroe Islands (1 February)
     * Eastern and Southern Africa (31 January)
     * Chile (30 January)

   In addition, the government announced on 11 September that it had
   secured "an agreement in principle" with six African nations - South
   Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and
   Mozambique.

   The deal is expected to be formally signed off "shortly".

South Korea

   The South Korea agreement is the first to be struck in Asia. The
   agreement is roughly in line with the terms of the existing Korea-EU
   free trade deal.

   Last year, total trade between the UK and South Korea was worth
   £14.6bn.

Central America

   Six Central American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
   Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) signed the UK-Central America
   Association Agreement on 18 July.

   The government says the deal means UK consumers will continue to
   benefit from lower prices on imported goods, such as prawns from
   Honduras and Costa Rican fruit.

   Total trade between the UK and Central America was worth £1bn in 2018.

Andean countries

   Colombia, Ecuador and Peru are the countries covered by the Andean
   agreement, signed on 15 May.

   Total trade between the UK and the Andean countries was worth £2.1bn in
   2018.

Norway and Iceland

   The agreement, signed on 2 April, maintains the same level of tariffs
   on goods traded between the UK, Iceland and Norway.

   The government says UK businesses will benefit from lower import
   prices, such as aluminium and some fuel and oil products.

   Total trade between the UK and Norway was worth £30bn in 2017. For
   Iceland, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show
   total trade was worth £1.8bn in 2017.

Caribbean countries

   The deal with the Caribbean states (known as the Cariforum) covers 12
   countries, including Barbados and Jamaica, and was signed on 22 March.

   A further two countries, the Bahamas and the Republic of Suriname, have
   agreed to the deal in principle and are "expected to sign shortly".

   Exporters of rum, bananas and sugar cane are all expected to benefit
   from the arrangement.

   Total trade between the UK and the region was worth around £2.5bn in
   2017.

   2017.

Pacific Islands

   The deal with the Pacific Islands - covering Fiji and Papua New Guinea
   - was signed on 14 March.

   The UK says the deal will gradually remove around 80% of tariffs on UK
   exports to these countries and maintain access to goods, such as fish
   and sugar.

   In 2017, total trade between the UK and the region was worth around
   £369m.

Israel

   The deal was formally signed on 18 February. The government says the
   agreement could save the UK vehicle industry up to £9m a year in tariff
   charges.

   According to the ONS, total trade between the UK and Israel was worth
   £3.9bn in 2017.

Palestinian Authority

   The UK-Palestinian Authority agreement was signed on 18 February.

   The UK government says the deal will benefit Palestinian exporters of
   fruit, nuts and olive oil.

   Total trade between the two was £25m in 2017, according to ONS figures.

Switzerland

   The UK-Switzerland agreement was confirmed in Bern on 11 February

   Without the deal, the UK government says the motor industry could have
   faced up to £8m in tariff charges, while aluminium exporters could have
   faced up to £4m.

   Trade between the UK and Switzerland was worth £32.1bn in 2017 -
   accounting for about 2.5% of total UK trade.

   An additional agreement was also signed by Liechtenstein's Minister for
   Foreign Affairs, Aurelia Frick. It applies the main parts of the
   Swiss-UK trade deal to her country too.

The Faroe Islands

   The Faroe Islands is the UK's 114th largest trading partner , according
   to the government. Total trade between the two countries was worth
   £236m in 2017.
   Image copyright Getty Images
   Image caption The UK imported more than £200m worth of fish from the
   Faroe Islands in 2017

   Fish and crustaceans made up the vast majority of UK's imports from the
   Faroes in 2017, worth £201.7m, while total UK exports to the country
   were worth only £6m - mostly machinery and mechanical appliances.

   The UK government says that the agreement it has reached will mean
   consumers continue to benefit from greater choice and lower fish prices
   "such as Atlantic salmon, haddock and halibut".

Eastern and Southern Africa

   Trade between the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region was worth
   £1.5bn in 2017 - about 0.1% of total UK trade. The UK-ESA deal covers
   Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Zimbabwe.

   Meat and fish are the main goods imported from the region by the UK
   (£111m).

Chile

   Signed at the end of January, the UK-Chile trade arrangement was the
   first to be done. Total trade between the UK and Chile was £1.8bn in
   2017 .

   Fruit, nuts and drinks are the top goods imported by the UK. The
   government says the deal will help to protect parts of the UK's wine
   industry.
   Image caption While the US is the UK's biggest single trading partner,
   the EU accounts for 46% of UK exports

Mutual recognition agreements

   The UK has also signed deals with the United States , Australia and New
   Zealand, but these are "mutual recognition agreements" and not free
   trade agreements.

   The Australia and New Zealand deal replicates all aspects of the
   current EU agreements when it comes to recognising product standards,
   such as the labelling and certifying of wine.

   The US agreement will, according to the Department for International
   Trade, particularly benefit the pharmaceutical sector which accounts
   for around £7.7bn of UK exports to the US - about 18% of the total.

Apprehensive

   So there's been some progress, but rolling over all deals in time for
   31 October could be difficult.

   "You can't simply roll over everything - these existing agreements will
   have references to EU law, so you cannot avoid some negotiation," says
   Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at University
   of Sussex.

   Some countries may also be apprehensive in signing deals right now,
   given that it is so unclear what Brexit will ultimately look like, adds
   Prof Winters.

   So what could the consequences be if trade arrangements are not fully
   in place and the UK leaves the EU with no deal?

   With the countries where the UK has no formal trade agreement, both
   would have to trade under the rules overseen by the World Trade
   Organization (WTO).
     * Reality Check: What is the WTO option?

   Trade would not stop if this were to happen but some barriers would go
   up, says Alex Stojanovic, from the Institute for Government think tank.

   "There is a reason you have trade agreements, it's that they give you
   better trade preferences than WTO terms.

   "So some businesses will be harmed by tariffs coming into play," he
   says.

   Rosa Parks Barbie Image copyright Mattel Inc Image caption The doll
   will come with educational material about her life

   Mattel has released a Barbie doll of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks.

   The company revealed Ms Parks is the latest addition to the Barbie's
   Inspiring Women's series. It comes with educational material about her
   life.

   Ms Parks' refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in 1955
   prompted a mass black boycott of buses, organised by Martin Luther King
   Jr.

   She was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, one of the
   highest civilian awards in the USA.

   The Rosa Parks doll wears 1950s style clothes.

   Mattel has also revealed a Sally Ride doll, to honour the first
   American woman in space. The announcement came on 26 August, also
   Women's Equality Day.

   Despite positive reaction to the dolls, some people on social media
   have said that the dolls give an unrealistic representation of women's
   bodies.

Why are they doing this now?

   There have been calls for Barbie to create dolls that represent the
   world girls see today.

   Earlier this year Mattel introduced a wheelchair user and a Barbie with
   a prosthetic leg. However it was criticised for reinforcing that all
   disabled women use a mobility aid such as a wheelchair.

   Last year, a black Barbie Doll's hairstyle was criticised for not
   accurately representing how black women would style their hair in real
   life.

   In 2016, Mattel unveiled curvy, tall and petite dolls in a bid to move
   away from the doll's signature shape. The new line also included wider
   range of skin tones and hairstyles.

   A study in 2006 in Developmental Psychology found that girls who saw
   images of Barbie dolls before filling out a questionnaire reported a
   worse body image than those who didn't see the dolls.
     __________________________________________________________________

'An issue toymakers have been aware of for some time'

   Nabihah Parkar, Radio 1 Newsbeat

   The new additions to their range mark the latest effort by an industry
   giant to diversify. But this is an issue smaller toymakers have been
   aware of for some time.

   Sharon McBean created Nia Ballerina, a black ballerina character, for
   her daughter in 2016 when she couldn't find a black ballerina doll
   anywhere in the world.

   She said that it's "frustrating and annoying" when bigger companies
   jump on the "bandwagon" to fill a gap in the market.

   "I'm not doing this to make money, more my daughter needs to see
   herself represented," she said.

   "Mattel don't need the publicity, it's people like myself and other
   small businesses that need it. And we're doing it because of the
   passion."

   Salam Sisters is a brand of dolls aiming to represent a positive Muslim
   identity. Co-founder Peter Gould hopes the new Barbie dolls will
   "reflect a change".

   "An iconic brand like Barbie that's inter-generational, hopefully it
   sends a message to parents.

   "Other bigger brands around like Disney, they're producing content to
   be more inclusive. I feel like it would've been nice if they were doing
   that 20 years ago."
     __________________________________________________________________

Who was Rosa Parks?

   Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama on 1 December 1955 for
   refusing to give up her seat for white passengers.

   At the time, black passengers were required to pay at the front of the
   bus, leave it, walk to the back of the vehicle and then re-enter.

   If the bus started filling up, they had to give up their seats for
   white customers.

   She was arrested and fined $14 (£11.43) for refusing to give up her
   seat.

   seat on a bus to a white man

   Her arrest triggered a 381-day boycott of the bus system organised by
   Martin Luther King Jr. The protest led to the desegregation of the
   transport system.

   Speaking in 1992, Ms Parks said: "The real reason of my not standing up
   was I felt that I had a right to be treated as any other passenger. We
   had endured that kind of treatment for too long."

   She moved to Detroit with her husband where she worked as an aide in a
   Democratic Congressman's office. Upon her retirement, Ms Parks devoted
   her time to an institute she and her husband founded, aimed at
   developing leadership among young people.

   Ms Parks died in 2005 aged 92.

     * MPs' expenses scandal

   Chris Davies MP Image copyright Alfred Collyer/PA Wire Image caption
   Chris Davies admitted the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court

   A Conservative MP has pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false
   expenses claim.

   Chris Davies admitted to one charge of providing false or misleading
   information for allowances claims and one of attempting to do so.

   The court heard how the charges related to when he was setting up his
   constituency office following the 2015 general election.

   The MP for Brecon and Radnorshire will be sentenced at the crown court.

   Davies, 51, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday, where
   District Judge John Zani said he did not consider his sentencing powers
   to be sufficient.
     * MP charged with forgery on expenses claims
     * Police quiz MP again over expenses claim

   He admitted that in March 2016 he made a claim under the MPs'
   allowances scheme and provided an invoice that he knew to be "false or
   misleading".

   The second charge was attempting to provide false or misleading
   information for an allowance claim using an invoice "that he knew to be
   false or misleading" in April 2016.

   Two offences of forgery were dropped.

   The court heard Davies had contacted a photographer in Brecon and
   purchased nine images from him to decorate and display in his
   constituency office - using his own money to pay the £700 for them
   initially.

   There were two budgets available to him, the Start Up Costs Budget -
   for office furniture and IT equipment - and The Office Costs Budget,
   both of which he could claim the full amount from.

   But Philip Stott, prosecuting, revealed Davies found in February 2016
   that only £476.02 was left in the Start Up Costs Budget, with £8,303.75
   remaining in the other.

   He then proceeded to create two fake invoices, so the £700 cost could
   be split between the two budgets - £450 to the Start Up and £250 for
   the other.

   The court heard he could have claimed the full amount from the budget
   with the larger amount available or had the photographer create new
   legitimate invoices to split the cost that way.
   Image caption Chris Davies unseated Liberal Democrat Roger Williams at
   the 2015 general election

   Mr Stott highlighted in a letter to the party investigating officer
   sent in February 2018, in which he responded to the allegations against
   him, that he had been "told in a conversation by a more experienced MP
   that you could 'split' expenses" and therefore attempted to do so.

   Davies has since repaid the £450, with the £250 claim never submitted.

   This is the first prosecution of its kind under the Parliamentary
   Standards Act.

   Thomas Forster, defending, said this was a "disastrous accounting
   episode" and added that Davies was the "author of his own misfortune."

   He argued the expenses system was not an "easy" one to understand and
   claimed Davies was "not motivated" by "personal gain".

   Mr Forster said his client was a "family man" with two children who was
   local to his constituency.
   Image copyright Yui Mok/PA Wire Image caption There have been calls for
   Davies to quit

   District Judge Zani said he noted that Davies was a man of good
   character who has shown "considerable remorse" and how there was no
   financial gain for actions.

   "However, in my view, these are two very serious offences to which you
   have pleaded guilty," he said.

   "The documents you created are troublesome in that they carried a deal
   of information that you put together which absolutely intended to
   deceive."

   He said as an MP, a position of considerable responsibility and trust,
   there was a need to be "meticulous in your claims".

   A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said Davies should resign, adding:
   "Representing his constituents in these circumstances is untenable.

   "Brecon and Radnorshire deserves better from its MP."

   Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, MP for Northumberland, also called on
   Davies to quit.

   He said: "Trust in politics and politicians is essential to our
   democracy. Chris Davies cannot remain a Tory MP after admitting to this
   offence."

   Davies was charged in February this year.

   He served as a councillor in Powys before he was elected as MP for
   Brecon and Radnorshire at the 2015 general election, beating incumbent
   Liberal Democrat Roger Williams with the seat's largest majority since
   1983.

   He was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office from
   January to July 2018

   Before entering politics he worked as a rural auctioneer, an estate
   agent and also managed a mixed veterinary practice in Hay-on-Wye.

   Penguins on the island Image copyright Family photo Image caption The
   sale offers a rare opportunity to live alongside these penguins

   An island on the Falklands is up for sale, complete with an army of
   penguins and its very own four-mile long beach.

   Pebble Island has been in the Dean family for 150 years but the
   great-great grandson of the original buyer, Sam Harris, from
   Pembrokeshire, has said it is time to sell up.

   It boasts five different species of penguins, 42 species of bird, sea
   lions, 6,000 sheep and 125 cattle.

   "It's an amazing place," Mr Harris said.

   "Unfortunately, it's just become too hard to manage."

     * Plymouth's historic Drake's Island fortress on sale for £6m

   Over the years, the family have sold off other islands there, and now
   only Pebble is left in their possession.

   No members of the family have lived on the island since the 1950s, and
   it is now managed by Mr Harris's mother, Claire, from the UK.

   coastline and mountain range
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption The owners would prefer to
   sell to someone interested in farming

   The island came into the family's possession in 1869, when it was
   purchased for just £400 by John Markham Dean alongside a few
   neighbouring islands. He had gone to the Falklands to set up a fish
   curing business after working in a butchery.

   "As a family, everyone has been allowed to go," Mr Harris said. "All
   the grandchildren have been able to go there with our husbands or wives
   and our children.

   "My wife, Lowri and I went there in 2011, and we had a close affinity
   with it. We talked about living there and taking over the hospitality
   side of the island, but it came as we were having children.

   "It was a difficult decision, but it comes down to the fact that my mum
   and dad aren't in a position to continue managing it.

   "It's going to be difficult to say goodbye to it."
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption Five different species of
   penguins live on the island
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption The island boasts a similar
   climate to west Wales say its owner... windy and rainy then!

   At 20 miles long and about four miles wide, Pebble Island is the third
   largest offshore island in the Falklands, complete with a mini mountain
   range, lakes, miles of coastline and cliffs, and a pebble beach after
   which it was named.

   It is home to a thriving sheep farm, established when it was purchased,
   a number of lodges which contribute to tourism on the island, 125
   cattle to boost the island's market, a wind turbine and solar panels to
   generate power. It is also an International Bird and Biodiversity Area
   (IBA).

   On top of that, it is a draw to those interested in military history,
   as the site of the first land-based action of the 1982 Falklands War,
   when the SAS landed by boat at night to disable the 11 Argentine
   aircraft on its runway.
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption The owner says it is quicker
   to travel to Australia from Wales than get to the island
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption Tourists can stay on the
   island in some of the lodges built there to attract visitors

   Mr Harris said the family do not have a price in mind for the island,
   but would prefer it went to someone with an interest in farming.

   "We want it to be developed, and to go to someone who will really care
   for it," he said.

   "It's got great potential with tourism because there's a big army base
   there, but there are also a lot of animals on the island, some which
   need to be looked after.

   "The island produces a lot of wool, much of which goes to the UK, so a
   farming background would be helpful.

   "We went to an estate agency to get it valued, but they couldn't value
   it because we've owned it for so long. There are no recent values on it
   they can go on. So we're open to offers."

How Australia is shaking up the truffle market

   Image caption Nigel Wood, holding the basket in this photo, invites
   visitors to join him on his truffle hunts

   When his dogs sniff out a prized black truffle under the soil, Nigel
   Wood says it is always an exciting moment for the accompanying humans
   too.

   "The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation
   and curiosity," he says.

   If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the
   expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs
   going through woodlands in France or Italy.

   Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for
   centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined
   by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's
   fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the
   French black or périgord.

   Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle
   Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in
   another decade's time the country could take the number one position.

   Image caption The prized French black or périgord truffle was first
   introduced to Australia in the 1990s

   While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given
   the secrecy that surrounds the "diamonds in the dirt", Australia is
   expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this
   year.

   This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30
   tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry
   experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production
   figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports
   périgords from Spain that then become "French".)

   What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very
   lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants,
   they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg.

   Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in
   the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To
   cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut
   saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with
   the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to
   harvest the resulting black truffles.

   Image caption The périgord truffle is definitely priced as a luxury
   item

   As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season
   in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder
   and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says
   this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are
   selling their crop when they are none available from Europe.

   "Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have
   any competitors," he says. "We produce truffles in the southern
   hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere."

   Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means
   that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can
   now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and
   summer.

   "We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to
   match the demand from overseas," says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The
   Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or
   truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the
   southern hemisphere.

   "We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop,"
   he says.
   Image copyright Truffle Melbourne

   Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has
   ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to
   allow expansion of the truffière.

   While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup,
   produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are
   now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected
   to grow.

   Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers
   Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce
   good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the
   desired alkaline levels.

   Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is
   "leaps and bounds ahead" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in
   South Africa, and countries in South America. "Australia has a
   multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are
   still finding their feet," he adds.

   Image caption Melbourne now has an annual truffle festival

   Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is
   also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe,
   the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy
   scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around
   education and raising the profile of truffles.

   "If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most
   would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate," says Barrett.
   "Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are
   inquisitive as to how they're grown and used."

Global Trade

   trade:

     * How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies
     * Should I offset my summer holiday flights?
     * Would you drink camel milk?
     * Why blue jeans are going green

   French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer
   awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central
   business district.

   "During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much
   of our menu and people ask for it," he says. "If you look around
   Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout
   winter and they're so popular they sell out.

   "There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them
   and people want to enjoy them."

   To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock,
   helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne.

   Image caption There is even a growing trend of adding truffles to sweet
   dishes, such as this plate of churros donuts

   And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter
   welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious
   crop.

   "On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth
   before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle," he
   says. "People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle
   they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about."

   Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: "There is good
   reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest
   producer of black truffles within the decade.

   "Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their
   production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and
   medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is
   usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently
   some large farms have also been established."

Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?

   By Tom Edgington BBC Reality Check
     * 11 September 2019
     * UK

   replaced Liam Fox

   The European Union (EU) has about 40 free trade deals, covering more
   than 70 countries. That means the UK, as a member of the EU, can
   currently trade with countries like Canada without having to pay taxes
   on imports (tariffs) on most goods.

   In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would suddenly lose
   tariff-free access to these markets and it would have to trade under
   World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

   To avoid this, the UK government is in the process of rolling over the
   EU's existing free trade deals with other countries - worth about 11%
   of total UK trade. The UK says it wants to replicate the EU's trade
   agreements "as far as possible" and have them ready to go in the event
   of a no-deal Brexit.

   If Brexit happens on 31 October, the UK will be free to negotiate and
   sign trade deals with countries where the EU has no trade agreement -
   such the US. However, the UK will also need to negotiate a free trade
   deal with the EU to ensure continued tariff-free access to its market.

   Last year, the EU accounted for 46% of UK exports, while the US
   accounted for 19%.

How many deals have been rolled over?

   So far, the UK has signed 13 "continuity" deals covering 38 countries
   or territories.
     * South Korea (signed 22 August)
     * Central America (18 July)
     * Andean countries (15 May)
     * Norway and Iceland (2 April)
     * Caribbean countries (22 March)
     * Pacific Islands (14 March)
     * Liechtenstein (28 February)
     * Israel (18 February)
     * Palestinian Authority (18 February)
     * Switzerland (11 February)
     * The Faroe Islands (1 February)
     * Eastern and Southern Africa (31 January)
     * Chile (30 January)

   In addition, the government announced on 11 September that it had
   secured "an agreement in principle" with six African nations - South
   Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and
   Mozambique.

   The deal is expected to be formally signed off "shortly".

South Korea

   The South Korea agreement is the first to be struck in Asia. The
   agreement is roughly in line with the terms of the existing Korea-EU
   free trade deal.

   Last year, total trade between the UK and South Korea was worth
   £14.6bn.

Central America

   Six Central American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
   Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) signed the UK-Central America
   Association Agreement on 18 July.

   The government says the deal means UK consumers will continue to
   benefit from lower prices on imported goods, such as prawns from
   Honduras and Costa Rican fruit.

   Total trade between the UK and Central America was worth £1bn in 2018.

Andean countries

   Colombia, Ecuador and Peru are the countries covered by the Andean
   agreement, signed on 15 May.

   Total trade between the UK and the Andean countries was worth £2.1bn in
   2018.

Norway and Iceland

   The agreement, signed on 2 April, maintains the same level of tariffs
   on goods traded between the UK, Iceland and Norway.

   The government says UK businesses will benefit from lower import
   prices, such as aluminium and some fuel and oil products.

   Total trade between the UK and Norway was worth £30bn in 2017. For
   Iceland, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show
   total trade was worth £1.8bn in 2017.

Caribbean countries

   The deal with the Caribbean states (known as the Cariforum) covers 12
   countries, including Barbados and Jamaica, and was signed on 22 March.

   A further two countries, the Bahamas and the Republic of Suriname, have
   agreed to the deal in principle and are "expected to sign shortly".

   Exporters of rum, bananas and sugar cane are all expected to benefit
   from the arrangement.

   Total trade between the UK and the region was worth around £2.5bn in
   2017.

   2017.

Pacific Islands

   The deal with the Pacific Islands - covering Fiji and Papua New Guinea
   - was signed on 14 March.

   The UK says the deal will gradually remove around 80% of tariffs on UK
   exports to these countries and maintain access to goods, such as fish
   and sugar.

   In 2017, total trade between the UK and the region was worth around
   £369m.

Israel

   The deal was formally signed on 18 February. The government says the
   agreement could save the UK vehicle industry up to £9m a year in tariff
   charges.

   According to the ONS, total trade between the UK and Israel was worth
   £3.9bn in 2017.

Palestinian Authority

   The UK-Palestinian Authority agreement was signed on 18 February.

   The UK government says the deal will benefit Palestinian exporters of
   fruit, nuts and olive oil.

   Total trade between the two was £25m in 2017, according to ONS figures.

Switzerland

   The UK-Switzerland agreement was confirmed in Bern on 11 February

   Without the deal, the UK government says the motor industry could have
   faced up to £8m in tariff charges, while aluminium exporters could have
   faced up to £4m.

   Trade between the UK and Switzerland was worth £32.1bn in 2017 -
   accounting for about 2.5% of total UK trade.

   An additional agreement was also signed by Liechtenstein's Minister for
   Foreign Affairs, Aurelia Frick. It applies the main parts of the
   Swiss-UK trade deal to her country too.

The Faroe Islands

   The Faroe Islands is the UK's 114th largest trading partner , according
   to the government. Total trade between the two countries was worth
   £236m in 2017.
   Image copyright Getty Images
   Image caption The UK imported more than £200m worth of fish from the
   Faroe Islands in 2017

   Fish and crustaceans made up the vast majority of UK's imports from the
   Faroes in 2017, worth £201.7m, while total UK exports to the country
   were worth only £6m - mostly machinery and mechanical appliances.

   The UK government says that the agreement it has reached will mean
   consumers continue to benefit from greater choice and lower fish prices
   "such as Atlantic salmon, haddock and halibut".

Eastern and Southern Africa

   Trade between the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region was worth
   £1.5bn in 2017 - about 0.1% of total UK trade. The UK-ESA deal covers
   Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Zimbabwe.

   Meat and fish are the main goods imported from the region by the UK
   (£111m).

Chile

   Signed at the end of January, the UK-Chile trade arrangement was the
   first to be done. Total trade between the UK and Chile was £1.8bn in
   2017 .

   Fruit, nuts and drinks are the top goods imported by the UK. The
   government says the deal will help to protect parts of the UK's wine
   industry.
   Image caption While the US is the UK's biggest single trading partner,
   the EU accounts for 46% of UK exports

Mutual recognition agreements

   The UK has also signed deals with the United States , Australia and New
   Zealand, but these are "mutual recognition agreements" and not free
   trade agreements.

   The Australia and New Zealand deal replicates all aspects of the
   current EU agreements when it comes to recognising product standards,
   such as the labelling and certifying of wine.

   The US agreement will, according to the Department for International
   Trade, particularly benefit the pharmaceutical sector which accounts
   for around £7.7bn of UK exports to the US - about 18% of the total.

Apprehensive

   So there's been some progress, but rolling over all deals in time for
   31 October could be difficult.

   "You can't simply roll over everything - these existing agreements will
   have references to EU law, so you cannot avoid some negotiation," says
   Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at University
   of Sussex.

   Some countries may also be apprehensive in signing deals right now,
   given that it is so unclear what Brexit will ultimately look like, adds
   Prof Winters.

   So what could the consequences be if trade arrangements are not fully
   in place and the UK leaves the EU with no deal?

   With the countries where the UK has no formal trade agreement, both
   would have to trade under the rules overseen by the World Trade
   Organization (WTO).
     * Reality Check: What is the WTO option?

   Trade would not stop if this were to happen but some barriers would go
   up, says Alex Stojanovic, from the Institute for Government think tank.

   "There is a reason you have trade agreements, it's that they give you
   better trade preferences than WTO terms.

   "So some businesses will be harmed by tariffs coming into play," he
   says.

   Rosa Parks Barbie Image copyright Mattel Inc Image caption The doll
   will come with educational material about her life

   Mattel has released a Barbie doll of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks.

   The company revealed Ms Parks is the latest addition to the Barbie's
   Inspiring Women's series. It comes with educational material about her
   life.

   Ms Parks' refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in 1955
   prompted a mass black boycott of buses, organised by Martin Luther King
   Jr.

   She was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, one of the
   highest civilian awards in the USA.

   The Rosa Parks doll wears 1950s style clothes.

   Mattel has also revealed a Sally Ride doll, to honour the first
   American woman in space. The announcement came on 26 August, also
   Women's Equality Day.

   Despite positive reaction to the dolls, some people on social media
   have said that the dolls give an unrealistic representation of women's
   bodies.

Why are they doing this now?

   There have been calls for Barbie to create dolls that represent the
   world girls see today.

   Earlier this year Mattel introduced a wheelchair user and a Barbie with
   a prosthetic leg. However it was criticised for reinforcing that all
   disabled women use a mobility aid such as a wheelchair.

   Last year, a black Barbie Doll's hairstyle was criticised for not
   accurately representing how black women would style their hair in real
   life.

   In 2016, Mattel unveiled curvy, tall and petite dolls in a bid to move
   away from the doll's signature shape. The new line also included wider
   range of skin tones and hairstyles.

   A study in 2006 in Developmental Psychology found that girls who saw
   images of Barbie dolls before filling out a questionnaire reported a
   worse body image than those who didn't see the dolls.

'An issue toymakers have been aware of for some time'

   Nabihah Parkar, Radio 1 Newsbeat

   The new additions to their range mark the latest effort by an industry
   giant to diversify. But this is an issue smaller toymakers have been
   aware of for some time.

   Sharon McBean created Nia Ballerina, a black ballerina character, for
   her daughter in 2016 when she couldn't find a black ballerina doll
   anywhere in the world.

   She said that it's "frustrating and annoying" when bigger companies
   jump on the "bandwagon" to fill a gap in the market.

   "I'm not doing this to make money, more my daughter needs to see
   herself represented," she said.

   "Mattel don't need the publicity, it's people like myself and other
   small businesses that need it. And we're doing it because of the
   passion."

   Salam Sisters is a brand of dolls aiming to represent a positive Muslim
   identity. Co-founder Peter Gould hopes the new Barbie dolls will
   "reflect a change".

   "An iconic brand like Barbie that's inter-generational, hopefully it
   sends a message to parents.

   "Other bigger brands around like Disney, they're producing content to
   be more inclusive. I feel like it would've been nice if they were doing
   that 20 years ago."

Who was Rosa Parks?

   Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama on 1 December 1955 for
   refusing to give up her seat for white passengers.

   At the time, black passengers were required to pay at the front of the
   bus, leave it, walk to the back of the vehicle and then re-enter.

   If the bus started filling up, they had to give up their seats for
   white customers.

   She was arrested and fined $14 (£11.43) for refusing to give up her
   seat.

   seat on a bus to a white man

   Her arrest triggered a 381-day boycott of the bus system organised by
   Martin Luther King Jr. The protest led to the desegregation of the
   transport system.

   Speaking in 1992, Ms Parks said: "The real reason of my not standing up
   was I felt that I had a right to be treated as any other passenger. We
   had endured that kind of treatment for too long."

   She moved to Detroit with her husband where she worked as an aide in a
   Democratic Congressman's office. Upon her retirement, Ms Parks devoted
   her time to an institute she and her husband founded, aimed at
   developing leadership among young people.

   Ms Parks died in 2005 aged 92.

     * MPs' expenses scandal

   Chris Davies MP Image copyright Alfred Collyer/PA Wire Image caption
   Chris Davies admitted the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court

   A Conservative MP has pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false
   expenses claim.

   Chris Davies admitted to one charge of providing false or misleading
   information for allowances claims and one of attempting to do so.

   The court heard how the charges related to when he was setting up his
   constituency office following the 2015 general election.

   The MP for Brecon and Radnorshire will be sentenced at the crown court.

   Davies, 51, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday, where
   District Judge John Zani said he did not consider his sentencing powers
   to be sufficient.
     * MP charged with forgery on expenses claims
     * Police quiz MP again over expenses claim

   He admitted that in March 2016 he made a claim under the MPs'
   allowances scheme and provided an invoice that he knew to be "false or
   misleading".

   The second charge was attempting to provide false or misleading
   information for an allowance claim using an invoice "that he knew to be
   false or misleading" in April 2016.

   Two offences of forgery were dropped.

   The court heard Davies had contacted a photographer in Brecon and
   purchased nine images from him to decorate and display in his
   constituency office - using his own money to pay the £700 for them
   initially.

   There were two budgets available to him, the Start Up Costs Budget -
   for office furniture and IT equipment - and The Office Costs Budget,
   both of which he could claim the full amount from.

   But Philip Stott, prosecuting, revealed Davies found in February 2016
   that only £476.02 was left in the Start Up Costs Budget, with £8,303.75
   remaining in the other.

   He then proceeded to create two fake invoices, so the £700 cost could
   be split between the two budgets - £450 to the Start Up and £250 for
   the other.

   The court heard he could have claimed the full amount from the budget
   with the larger amount available or had the photographer create new
   legitimate invoices to split the cost that way.
   Image caption Chris Davies unseated Liberal Democrat Roger Williams at
   the 2015 general election

   Mr Stott highlighted in a letter to the party investigating officer
   sent in February 2018, in which he responded to the allegations against
   him, that he had been "told in a conversation by a more experienced MP
   that you could 'split' expenses" and therefore attempted to do so.

   Davies has since repaid the £450, with the £250 claim never submitted.

   This is the first prosecution of its kind under the Parliamentary
   Standards Act.

   Thomas Forster, defending, said this was a "disastrous accounting
   episode" and added that Davies was the "author of his own misfortune."

   He argued the expenses system was not an "easy" one to understand and
   claimed Davies was "not motivated" by "personal gain".

   Mr Forster said his client was a "family man" with two children who was
   local to his constituency.
   Image copyright Yui Mok/PA Wire Image caption There have been calls for
   Davies to quit

   District Judge Zani said he noted that Davies was a man of good
   character who has shown "considerable remorse" and how there was no
   financial gain for actions.

   "However, in my view, these are two very serious offences to which you
   have pleaded guilty," he said.

   "The documents you created are troublesome in that they carried a deal
   of information that you put together which absolutely intended to
   deceive."

   He said as an MP, a position of considerable responsibility and trust,
   there was a need to be "meticulous in your claims".

   A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said Davies should resign, adding:
   "Representing his constituents in these circumstances is untenable.

   "Brecon and Radnorshire deserves better from its MP."

   Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, MP for Northumberland, also called on
   Davies to quit.

   He said: "Trust in politics and politicians is essential to our
   democracy. Chris Davies cannot remain a Tory MP after admitting to this
   offence."

   Davies was charged in February this year.

   He served as a councillor in Powys before he was elected as MP for
   Brecon and Radnorshire at the 2015 general election, beating incumbent
   Liberal Democrat Roger Williams with the seat's largest majority since
   1983.

   He was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office from
   January to July 2018

   Before entering politics he worked as a rural auctioneer, an estate
   agent and also managed a mixed veterinary practice in Hay-on-Wye.

   Penguins on the island Image copyright Family photo Image caption The
   sale offers a rare opportunity to live alongside these penguins

   An island on the Falklands is up for sale, complete with an army of
   penguins and its very own four-mile long beach.

   Pebble Island has been in the Dean family for 150 years but the
   great-great grandson of the original buyer, Sam Harris, from
   Pembrokeshire, has said it is time to sell up.

   It boasts five different species of penguins, 42 species of bird, sea
   lions, 6,000 sheep and 125 cattle.

   "It's an amazing place," Mr Harris said.

   "Unfortunately, it's just become too hard to manage."

     * Plymouth's historic Drake's Island fortress on sale for £6m

   Over the years, the family have sold off other islands there, and now
   only Pebble is left in their possession.

   No members of the family have lived on the island since the 1950s, and
   it is now managed by Mr Harris's mother, Claire, from the UK.

   coastline and mountain range
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption The owners would prefer to
   sell to someone interested in farming

   The island came into the family's possession in 1869, when it was
   purchased for just £400 by John Markham Dean alongside a few
   neighbouring islands. He had gone to the Falklands to set up a fish
   curing business after working in a butchery.

   "As a family, everyone has been allowed to go," Mr Harris said. "All
   the grandchildren have been able to go there with our husbands or wives
   and our children.

   "My wife, Lowri and I went there in 2011, and we had a close affinity
   with it. We talked about living there and taking over the hospitality
   side of the island, but it came as we were having children.

   "It was a difficult decision, but it comes down to the fact that my mum
   and dad aren't in a position to continue managing it.

   "It's going to be difficult to say goodbye to it."
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption Five different species of
   penguins live on the island
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption The island boasts a similar
   climate to west Wales say its owner... windy and rainy then!

   At 20 miles long and about four miles wide, Pebble Island is the third
   largest offshore island in the Falklands, complete with a mini mountain
   range, lakes, miles of coastline and cliffs, and a pebble beach after
   which it was named.

   It is home to a thriving sheep farm, established when it was purchased,
   a number of lodges which contribute to tourism on the island, 125
   cattle to boost the island's market, a wind turbine and solar panels to
   generate power. It is also an International Bird and Biodiversity Area
   (IBA).

   On top of that, it is a draw to those interested in military history,
   as the site of the first land-based action of the 1982 Falklands War,
   when the SAS landed by boat at night to disable the 11 Argentine
   aircraft on its runway.

   to travel to Australia from Wales than get to the island
   Image copyright Family photo Image caption Tourists can stay on the
   island in some of the lodges built there to attract visitors

   Mr Harris said the family do not have a price in mind for the island,
   but would prefer it went to someone with an interest in farming.

   "We want it to be developed, and to go to someone who will really care
   for it," he said.

   "It's got great potential with tourism because there's a big army base
   there, but there are also a lot of animals on the island, some which
   need to be looked after.

   "The island produces a lot of wool, much of which goes to the UK, so a
   farming background would be helpful.

   "We went to an estate agency to get it valued, but they couldn't value
   it because we've owned it for so long. There are no recent values on it
   they can go on. So we're open to offers."

   Four Earths Image copyright Thinkstock

   It has been suggested that if everyone on the planet consumed as much
   as the average US citizen, four Earths would be needed to sustain them.
   But where does this claim originate, and how is it calculated?

   The world's seven billion people consume varying amounts of the
   planet's resources. Compare the lifestyle of a subsistence farmer with
   that of a wealthy city-dweller in a developed country. More land is
   required to grow the city dweller's food, more materials are used to
   build the city dweller's home and workplace, more energy is required
   for transport, heating and cooling.

   So it's obvious that Americans consume more, on average, than the
   people of less developed countries. But the claim that four Earths
   would be needed if everyone lived like Americans is still a striking
   one.

   It has been recurring on social media at least since 2012, when science
   writer Tim De Chant produced this infographic illustrating how much
   land would be required if seven billion people lived like the
   populations of nine selected countries from Bangladesh to the United
   Arab Emirates.

   De Chant was using a subset of data produced by the Global Footprint
   Network (GFN), which has been attempting the tricky business of
   measuring the impact of humans on the planet since 2003.

   "Ecological footprinting" is where researchers look at how much land,
   sea and other natural resources are used to produce what people consume
   - how many potatoes they eat, how much milk they drink, the cotton that
   goes into the shirts they wear and so on.

   They do this by using published statistics on consumption and the
   amount of land or sea used to produce the quantity of goods consumed.

   "It's a book-keeping approach for resources," says GFN director and
   co-founder Mathis Wackernagel.

   The key questions for GFN, he says, are: "If there is one planet - how
   much planet is available per person and how much planet do we use per
   person."

   The answers are expressed in an unusual unit - the global hectare,
   defined as a biologically productive hectare with world-average
   bioproductivity.

   The average American, says GFN, uses seven global hectares, compared to
   a global average of 2.7, according to the most recent GFN figures
   (based on data from 2011). It's this figure of seven global hectares
   that allows Wackernagel and his colleagues to calculate that it would
   take four Earths - or to be precise, 3.9 Earths - to sustain a
   population of seven billion at American levels of consumption.

   However, the US does not consume the most on this measure. It is in
   fact ranked fifth among countries with a population of one million or
   more. Kuwait comes top with 8.9 global hectares (5.1 Earths), followed
   by Australia (4.8 Earths), the United Arab Emirates (4.7 Earths) and
   Qatar (4.0 Earths). The others in the top 10 are Canada, Sweden,
   Bahrain, Trinidad and Tobago, and Singapore. The UK is 32nd on the list
   (2.4 Earths).

   Country Footprint per person How many Earths?
   Kuwait 8.9 global hectares 5.1
   Australia 8.3 4.8
   United Arab Emirates 8.1 4.7
   Qatar 7.0 4.0
   United States of America 6.8 3.9
   Canada 6.6 3.8
   Sweden 6.5 3.8
   Bahrain 6.2 3.6
   Trinidad and Tobago 6.0 3.5
   Singapore 5.9 3.4
   Source: GFN (2011 data)

   How useful are these figures?

   One curious thing to note is that according to the Global Footprint
   Network, the world's population is currently using not one, but
   one-and-a-half Earths.

   That's because it takes account of carbon emissions. The forests and
   oceans of the world absorb a lot of carbon dioxide, but we are
   currently emitting more than the planet can handle - and Wackernagel's
   team has calculated how much extra land and sea we would need to absorb
   it. They estimate that we need an extra half a planet.

     These figures don't say anything about sustainability of cropland,
     such as the erosion of soil

     Linus Blomqvist, Breakthrough Institute

   If we now look again at the average American footprint - two-thirds of
   that is made up of carbon emissions.

   This means that for the four Earths we would need if everyone consumed
   like an American, more than two-and-a-half of those would be needed
   just to absorb carbon dioxide.

   This calculation has its critics.

   "It seems a little odd to convert what's happening in the atmosphere
   into a proxy measure and pretend you're measuring land when you're
   not," says Fred Pearce, environment correspondent for New Scientist
   magazine.

   But Mathis Wackernagel says it is important to include carbon emissions
   in the calculation to capture the "total package" of our activity.

   Another criticism - made, for example by Linus Blomqvist, Director of
   Conservation at the Breakthrough Institute in California - is that
   there is insufficient data from many parts of the world to create
   meaningful ecological footprint estimates. Researchers just don't know
   how sustainable some agricultural practices are, and therefore to what
   extent resources are being overused.

   "Our critique is that these figures don't say anything about
   sustainability of cropland, such as the erosion of soil," Blomqvist
   says.

   Wackernagel accepts this criticism, to an extent.

   "I would be perfectly blunt - our numbers are certainly wrong. I'm
   convinced our numbers are underestimates.

   "There are aspects on which no good data exists that we don't include,
   so our demand on nature is larger."

   While these figures may not be perfect, Wackernagel says that
   governments can find them useful as a way of thinking about policies on
   the environment.

   For example, Switzerland publishes ecological footprint estimates on
   its Federal Statistics Office website. The UK, meanwhile, has formed a
   Natural Capital Committee to study how the country consumes its natural
   resources and how long, at current rates, they will last.
