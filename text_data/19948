Can I take 2 tickets for the same show in my reservation with my pass?

The pass is strictly personal, so you can not buy multiple tickets for the same
performance. If you wish to attend a show with friends, make sure your friends a
lso have their pass, and then book each ticket in your booking area.

When and how to book my shows after buying my pass?

After purchasing your pass, you will receive a confirmation email and an email w
ith your pass number and PIN. You must go to www.zoofest.com in the MY SPACE sec
tion, connect to it using your pass number and your PIN. When you are connected
to your space, you simply have to press the desired shows and they will automati
cally register. You will also receive a confirmation email for each of your book
ings.

How can I change my choice of shows included in my pass?

According to our policies, no exchange is accepted. However, if you made a mista
ke while selecting a show, or if 2 selected shows come into conflict, contact us
 immediately at 514-509-5273 or info@zoofest.com so we can proceed canceling you
r ticket. You can then proceed again to make your selection.

I can not book a show with my pass, but there are tickets available for sale,
why do not I have access to it?

For each show, we fairly distributed our inventory between single tickets and ti
ckets available with passes. When the maximum inventory for passes is reached, i
t is no longer bookable with your member code. You always have the opportunity t
o buy single tickets if such a case occurs. It is also possible that some shows
have additional performances; they will then be accessible again for new perform
ances. First come, first served ! The selection of shows with the pass extends t
o all Zoofest & OFF-JFL programming, there is a very wide choice available to yo
u!

I can not buy my pass / tickets or book my shows due to a problem on the
website, what should I do?

The problem may be related to the Internet browser you are using. Try to visit o
ur site via another browser or refresh your page. If the problem persists, pleas
e contact us either by email at info@zoofest.com or by phone at 514-509-5273 (1-
877-353-3378).

Where and when can I pick up my pass?

No need to move, the pass is now electronic! Make sure you have the barcode of y
our password handy on your smartphone or print a copy of it before going to the
room.

If at the time of purchase you have selected the option "Physical Pass $4", it h
as been sent to you by mail to the address appearing in the customer portal! If
you still have not received anything and you have chosen the "$4 Physical Pass"
option, contact us at info@zoofest.com and our team will take care of resolving
the situation quickly.

I would like to exchange or cancel a show booking, how to do?

According to our policies, no exchange or refund is accepted. For any request re
lated to a change or a cancellation of ticket due to an error or a force majeure
, please contact us with your order number in reference to info@zoofest.com. Our
 team will come back to you with an answer within 3 working days.

Can we reserve his seat?

All Zoofest shows are general admission shows. So there is no assigned seat, it'
s first come, first seated! It is better to plan your arrival a little early. Th
e opening time of the doors of each show is indicated on each ticket. Latecomers
 may not be allowed, especially for theater.

What places are wheelchair accessible?

All our rooms are accessible for people with reduced mobility, except Café Cleop
atra. For shows taking place at Katacombes, please arrive 20 minutes before the
show begins. For shows taking place at the Monument National, please arrive 30 m
inutes before the show begins.

Why is the selection no longer unlimited as it was a few years ago?

We have received many requests for the opportunity to reserve in advance represe
ntations for a better organization of your Zoofest experience. In addition, our
entry-level pass, the Zooff, gives access to 3 shows in advance and 1 free show
per day. The festival lasts on average 24 days, which gives you the opportunity
to see up to 27 shows. Even our most fanatical festivalgoers do not attend so ma
ny shows!

Are my free and included tickets each day of the festival transferable?

The tickets reserved with the pass are exclusively usable by the pass holder. Ho
wever, for free tickets every day, it will be possible to release his selection
if the holder of the said pass can not attend this show, to give other players t
he chance to book.

How can I book my free shows every day of the festival?

During the festival, simply login to your zoofest.com Member Space with your pas
s number and PIN to access your free shows. The inventory is however limited, so
 be sure to regularly check the shows that are available to you. A new selection
 will be posted every day of the festival, and this, from 24h to 48h in advance
depending on the privileges of your type of pass.

How can I get my pass number and PIN again if I have lost them?

You must contact us by email at info@zoofest.com, or by phone at 514-509-5273, w
ith your reference number. An advisor will be able to send you this information
again. Please note that in summer during the festival, the speed of returns can
be affected.

Are there rooms forbidden for children under 18?

The Katacombes, the Comedy Work, the Café Cleopatra, the Wiggle Room and the New
speak are all forbidden for children under 18 years old.

I did not receive my e-tickets after my reservation, what should I do?

If you have not received your e-tickets as a result of a purchase, first check t
hat they are not in your "unwanted e-mails" or filtered in the "specials" sectio
n of your e-mail. If you still can not find them, contact the box office at info
@zoofest.com ; the team in place will be able to resolve the situation.

If you have booked your included or free tickets and have not received a confirm
ation email, first check that they do not end up in your "unwanted emails", or f
iltered in the "specials" section of your email inbox. If not, you can always go
 to your Member Space and check the status of your bookings. If a green checkmar
k indicates "booked" it means that the reservation has been made. Note that in t
he case of the included and free tickets, your pass code acts as a ticket, so it
 is normal not to receive a different ticket for the reservation. In the confirm
ation email, you will find the bar code of your pass, which you can present at t
he entrance of the room.
