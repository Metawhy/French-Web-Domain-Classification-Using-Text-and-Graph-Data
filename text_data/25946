Stranger Things Season 4 to Reportedly Begin Shooting This Fall

   It sounds like we won't have to wait as long for the latest season of
   Stranger Things, which should come as great news for fans still reeling
   after that emotional Season 3 finale. While the new season has yet to
   be officially announced, the cliffhanger ending, the audience and
   critical reaction — coupled with estimates of viewing numbers from
   third-party sources — make it clear that Stranger Things 4 is
   inevitable.

   Now a new listing from Production Weekly indicates that Netflix is
   gearing up to begin filming on Stranger Things 4 in October, meaning
   the new season could premiere as early as 2020.

   This shouldn't be a huge surprise for anyone, but it's great to know
   that Netflix seems eager to get back to work on the series. As the
   young cast members get older, the producers would likely prefer to
   finish the show before they become adults.

   The people involved with Stranger Things have always been cagey about
   how long they envision the show continuing, with the common answer
   being four or five seasons before ending.

   Recent rumors from We Got This Covered suggest the series is planned to
   end after Season 4, but their track record for unsourced information is
   less than stellar. It's likely more of an educated guess than a fact.

   But we do know that there are contracts in place for the cast to return
   for Stranger Things 4. A report from TV Line indicated that actor David
   Harbour has an option to return for a potential fourth season, which
   likely bodes well for the character Hopper considering how the
   cliffhanger ending in the latest finale.

   ComicBook's Adam Barnhardt spoke with Harbour and asked if he's
   appearing in Stranger Things 4, and the actor was cagey in how
   addressing the question.

   "There's always discussion on set about kicking around ideas about what
   would be cool and stuff, but there's a lot of stuff that goes down in
   season three that you're going to want to pay attention to before you
   start thinking at all about the future," Harbour teased. "They pulled
   no punches with the season, and it's a big deal what goes down. So you
   really have to watch this before you start even speculating."

   We're still waiting on the official announcement from Netflix, but for
   now fans can get caught up with the latest misadventures in Hawkins,
   Indiana by watching Stranger Things 3, now streaming on the platform.

Disney CEO Bob Iger Reflects on George Lucas’ Disappointed Reaction to Star
Wars: The Force Awakens

   In a matter of months, Star Wars will bring a close to the Skywalker
   Saga with an epic bang. December will usher in the release of Star
   Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and excitement for the film is at a high.
   Still, there are fans who push back against the sequel trilogy, and it
   turns out they had some major support on their team. After all, Disney
   CEO Bob Iger says George Lucas was disappointed at first after he saw
   the sequel series' first film.

   Recently, Iger shared the story of Lucas' reaction to Star Wars: The
   Force Awakens upon his first screening. The CEO chose to include the
   anecdote in his latest book, Iger’s The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons
   Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company, and it was
   there Iger said Lucas "didn't hide his disappointment" over The Force
   Awakens.

   According to Lucas, there was "nothing new" about the film which caught
   his eye or interest.

   "In each of the films in the original trilogy, it was important to him
   to present new worlds, new stories, new characters, and new
   technologies. In this one, he said, “There weren’t enough visual or
   technical leaps forward.” He wasn’t wrong, but he also wasn’t
   appreciating the pressure we were under to give ardent fans a film that
   felt quintessentially Star Wars," Iger explained.

   "We’d intentionally created a world that was visually and tonally
   connected to the earlier films, to not stray too far from what people
   loved and expected, and George was criticizing us for the very thing we
   were trying to do."

   While Lucas might not have been a fan of the film to start, Iger is
   wholly supportive of The Force Awakens. The CEO says J.J. Abrams' did
   the "near-impossible" by bridging the previous Star Wars trilogies with
   what was to come for the franchise. Nowadays, Disney has put a focus on
   Star Wars even outside of the big screen. In a matter of months, the
   company will see The Mandalorian debut on Disney+ as the franchise's
   first live-action venture. Clearly, things are ever expanding with Star
   Wars whether or not Lucas gives his seal of approval from the start.

   Can you understand where Lucas' disappointment came from? Let me know
   in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @MeganPetersCB to talk all
   things comics and anime!

Stranger Things Season 4 to Reportedly Begin Shooting This Fall

   JK Schmidt

   07/18/2019 03:48 pm EDT

   It sounds like we won't have to wait as long for the latest season of
   Stranger Things, which should come as great news for fans still reeling
   after that emotional Season 3 finale. While the new season has yet to
   be officially announced, the cliffhanger ending, the audience and
   critical reaction — coupled with estimates of viewing numbers from
   third-party sources — make it clear that Stranger Things 4 is
   inevitable.

   Now a new listing from Production Weekly indicates that Netflix is
   gearing up to begin filming on Stranger Things 4 in October, meaning
   the new season could premiere as early as 2020.

   This shouldn't be a huge surprise for anyone, but it's great to know
   that Netflix seems eager to get back to work on the series. As the
   young cast members get older, the producers would likely prefer to
   finish the show before they become adults.

   The people involved with Stranger Things have always been cagey about
   how long they envision the show continuing, with the common answer
   being four or five seasons before ending.

   Recent rumors from We Got This Covered suggest the series is planned to
   end after Season 4, but their track record for unsourced information is
   less than stellar. It's likely more of an educated guess than a fact.

   But we do know that there are contracts in place for the cast to return
   for Stranger Things 4. A report from TV Line indicated that actor David
   Harbour has an option to return for a potential fourth season, which
   likely bodes well for the character Hopper considering how the
   cliffhanger ending in the latest finale.

   ComicBook's Adam Barnhardt spoke with Harbour and asked if he's
   appearing in Stranger Things 4, and the actor was cagey in how
   addressing the question.

   "There's always discussion on set about kicking around ideas about what
   would be cool and stuff, but there's a lot of stuff that goes down in
   season three that you're going to want to pay attention to before you
   start thinking at all about the future," Harbour teased. "They pulled
   no punches with the season, and it's a big deal what goes down. So you
   really have to watch this before you start even speculating."

   We're still waiting on the official announcement from Netflix, but for
   now fans can get caught up with the latest misadventures in Hawkins,
   Indiana by watching Stranger Things 3, now streaming on the platform.

Disney CEO Bob Iger Reflects on George Lucas’ Disappointed Reaction to Star
Wars: The Force Awakens

   Megan Peters

   09/23/2019 05:54 pm EDT

   In a matter of months, Star Wars will bring a close to the Skywalker
   Saga with an epic bang. December will usher in the release of Star
   Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and excitement for the film is at a high.
   Still, there are fans who push back against the sequel trilogy, and it
   turns out they had some major support on their team. After all, Disney
   CEO Bob Iger says George Lucas was disappointed at first after he saw
   the sequel series' first film.

   Recently, Iger shared the story of Lucas' reaction to Star Wars: The
   Force Awakens upon his first screening. The CEO chose to include the
   anecdote in his latest book, Iger’s The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons
   Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company, and it was
   there Iger said Lucas "didn't hide his disappointment" over The Force
   Awakens.

   According to Lucas, there was "nothing new" about the film which caught
   his eye or interest.

   "In each of the films in the original trilogy, it was important to him
   to present new worlds, new stories, new characters, and new
   technologies. In this one, he said, “There weren’t enough visual or
   technical leaps forward.” He wasn’t wrong, but he also wasn’t
   appreciating the pressure we were under to give ardent fans a film that
   felt quintessentially Star Wars," Iger explained.

   "We’d intentionally created a world that was visually and tonally
   connected to the earlier films, to not stray too far from what people
   loved and expected, and George was criticizing us for the very thing we
   were trying to do."

   While Lucas might not have been a fan of the film to start, Iger is
   wholly supportive of The Force Awakens. The CEO says J.J. Abrams' did
   the "near-impossible" by bridging the previous Star Wars trilogies with
   what was to come for the franchise. Nowadays, Disney has put a focus on
   Star Wars even outside of the big screen. In a matter of months, the
   company will see The Mandalorian debut on Disney+ as the franchise's
   first live-action venture. Clearly, things are ever expanding with Star
   Wars whether or not Lucas gives his seal of approval from the start.

   Can you understand where Lucas' disappointment came from? Let me know
   in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @MeganPetersCB to talk all
   things comics and anime!

   Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will be in theaters on December 20th.
   The rest of the prequel trilogy is currently available on home video.

Stranger Things Season 4 to Reportedly Begin Shooting This Fall

   JK Schmidt

   07/18/2019 03:48 pm EDT

   It sounds like we won't have to wait as long for the latest season of
   Stranger Things, which should come as great news for fans still reeling
   after that emotional Season 3 finale. While the new season has yet to
   be officially announced, the cliffhanger ending, the audience and
   critical reaction — coupled with estimates of viewing numbers from
   third-party sources — make it clear that Stranger Things 4 is
   inevitable.

   Now a new listing from Production Weekly indicates that Netflix is
   gearing up to begin filming on Stranger Things 4 in October, meaning
   the new season could premiere as early as 2020.

   This shouldn't be a huge surprise for anyone, but it's great to know
   that Netflix seems eager to get back to work on the series. As the
   young cast members get older, the producers would likely prefer to
   finish the show before they become adults.

   The people involved with Stranger Things have always been cagey about
   how long they envision the show continuing, with the common answer
   being four or five seasons before ending.

   Recent rumors from We Got This Covered suggest the series is planned to
   end after Season 4, but their track record for unsourced information is
   less than stellar. It's likely more of an educated guess than a fact.

   But we do know that there are contracts in place for the cast to return
   for Stranger Things 4. A report from TV Line indicated that actor David
   Harbour has an option to return for a potential fourth season, which
   likely bodes well for the character Hopper considering how the
   cliffhanger ending in the latest finale.

   ComicBook's Adam Barnhardt spoke with Harbour and asked if he's
   appearing in Stranger Things 4, and the actor was cagey in how
   addressing the question.

   "There's always discussion on set about kicking around ideas about what
   would be cool and stuff, but there's a lot of stuff that goes down in
   season three that you're going to want to pay attention to before you
   start thinking at all about the future," Harbour teased. "They pulled
   no punches with the season, and it's a big deal what goes down. So you
   really have to watch this before you start even speculating."

   We're still waiting on the official announcement from Netflix, but for
   now fans can get caught up with the latest misadventures in Hawkins,
   Indiana by watching Stranger Things 3, now streaming on the platform.

Disney CEO Bob Iger Reflects on George Lucas’ Disappointed Reaction to Star
Wars: The Force Awakens

   Megan Peters

   09/23/2019 05:54 pm EDT

   In a matter of months, Star Wars will bring a close to the Skywalker
   Saga with an epic bang. December will usher in the release of Star
   Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and excitement for the film is at a high.
   Still, there are fans who push back against the sequel trilogy, and it
   turns out they had some major support on their team. After all, Disney
   CEO Bob Iger says George Lucas was disappointed at first after he saw
   the sequel series' first film.

   Recently, Iger shared the story of Lucas' reaction to Star Wars: The
   Force Awakens upon his first screening. The CEO chose to include the
   anecdote in his latest book, Iger’s The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons
   Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company, and it was
   there Iger said Lucas "didn't hide his disappointment" over The Force
   Awakens.

   According to Lucas, there was "nothing new" about the film which caught
   his eye or interest.

   "In each of the films in the original trilogy, it was important to him
   to present new worlds, new stories, new characters, and new
   technologies. In this one, he said, “There weren’t enough visual or
   technical leaps forward.” He wasn’t wrong, but he also wasn’t
   appreciating the pressure we were under to give ardent fans a film that
   felt quintessentially Star Wars," Iger explained.

   "We’d intentionally created a world that was visually and tonally
   connected to the earlier films, to not stray too far from what people
   loved and expected, and George was criticizing us for the very thing we
   were trying to do."

   While Lucas might not have been a fan of the film to start, Iger is
   wholly supportive of The Force Awakens. The CEO says J.J. Abrams' did
   the "near-impossible" by bridging the previous Star Wars trilogies with
   what was to come for the franchise. Nowadays, Disney has put a focus on
   Star Wars even outside of the big screen. In a matter of months, the
   company will see The Mandalorian debut on Disney+ as the franchise's
   first live-action venture. Clearly, things are ever expanding with Star
   Wars whether or not Lucas gives his seal of approval from the start.

   Can you understand where Lucas' disappointment came from? Let me know
   in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @MeganPetersCB to talk all
   things comics and anime!

   Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will be in theaters on December 20th.
   The rest of the prequel trilogy is currently available on home video.
