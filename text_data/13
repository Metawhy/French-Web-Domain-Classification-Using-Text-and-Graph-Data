Back in my Day

   Cardigan - Vintage | Top & Skirt - H&M | Tights & Socks - Primark |
   Belt - Stolen from another dress | Boots - Zara
   I know I said I didn't like this skirt a couple of posts ago, however I
   think it works much better with boots as opposed to shoes - what do you
   think? Or maybe it's the darker tights, who knows, but it's back in my
   good books.
   Yesterday was the first day of Chinese New Year (Kung Hei Fat Choi!!!),
   though it was a really wet and cold day, there was still lots to do.
   My Ma and me started the day by popping by The Vintage Flea Market, I
   think we arrived too late as the stalls were pretty bare.  The thing
   about 'Vintage' fairs, they're all so expensive and packed nowadays as
   they're so popular, gone are the days when they were simply known as
   jumble sales and you could find that hidden gem.  Even charity shops
   (well at least in London) have cottoned on and there are no more 50p
   bargains! sheesh - does anyone know any places to find good bargains in
   London?
   In the afternoon we headed to our favourite Dim Sum restaurant - Royal
   China, where we met up with by Bro and Pa and stuffed ourselves silly
   with dumplings.  Everything was scrummy but if you do go, you must try
   the BBQ pork puffs - sticky, sweet with crumbly pastry - to die for!
   Did anyone else do anything for Chinese New Year?

Chop Chop

   [8399437760_41406e502a_o.jpg]
   And so I present to you my new do, I mean it's nothing particularly
   special or different, but it is around 5inch shorter and now dye free,
   and I'm loving it.
   I haven't had my hair cut in AGES, and I really fancied the change, and
   I am so chuffed!

   I'm currently enjoying a very lazy Sunday, I'm still in my PJ's and
   watching repeats of Come Dine With Me - for those not in the UK, it's a
   hilarious cooking programme which is less about the cooking and more
   about the quirky contestants.
   It's been a busy busy two weeks with late nights at work and a flying
   visit to Ireland for my Nan's 80th Birthday.  She got an almighty
   surprise, but it sure was knackering, flying Saturday morning, party
   Saturday night and flying back Sunday morning.

   This is quite a comfy outfit but perfect for the windy cold weather
   we're currently experiencing here in London.
   A couple of weeks ago we saved a mouse from our cat ... however it
   escaped and now it's hiding in the cupboard, so we've inadvertently
   caused a mouse problem in our house. doh!  We've put down humane traps,
   but the mouse has outsmarted them.  I think we're going to have to
   resort to poison :(

Scruffy Pup

   Aran Cardigan - Vintage | Top - H&M | Skirt, Tights & Socks - Primark |
   Necklace - Accessorize | Boots - Office
   I think I look like a bit of a scruffball here - with the messy hair
   and slouchy cardigan, but I still quite like it - what do you guys
   think?
   I really like pencil skirts and body con mid-length dresses, however my
   muffin top does not agree, so I have to pair them with baggy tops.  I
   need some inspiration how to style them with a not so slender body,
   anyone got any tips?  I also never realised how hard it was to find a
   plan oversized T, their either far too long, far too see-through or far
   too high in the neck - sheesh, who knew it would be so difficult to
   find such a basic item!
   Anyone else have problems of what you thought to be a basic item?
   And this will be the last pic with my long locks, as I'll be revealing
   my new shorter do.
   This weekend I shall be be jetting off to Ireland tomorrow for one
   night only for my Nana's Surprise 80th Birthday.  It should be good,
   though I don't think I'll be getting much sleep as there will be about
   30 people staying in 2 houses ... fun!  I'll let you know how it goes.
   What's everyone else's plans for the weekend?
