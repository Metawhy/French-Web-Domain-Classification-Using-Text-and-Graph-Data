ITSNT 2020 and beyond
       ITSNT has enjoyed 5 years of successful participation, and CNES and
       ENAC have now decided to give a new dimension to the ITSNT event in
       order to increase its outreach. CNES and ENAC propose that ITSNT
       becomes an event associated to the Toulouse Space Show every 2
       years (even years), starting from mid june 2020 at the new
       Convention Center of Toulouse close to the airport.
       This jump forward is an exciting opportunity to increase the number
       of sessions, enlarge the number of participants, and enrich
       networking.   ITSNT will from now on be held annually in June,
       potentially located elsewhere in Toulouse in the odd years starting
       from 2021, and skipping ITSNT 2019 edition in order to get fully
       ready for ITSNT 2020 June edition.
       Therefore, we will shortly begin communicating the new format of
       ITSNT, announcing guest speakers and opening the call for abstracts
       for ITSNT 2020 through this channel.

International Symposium on Navigation and Timing
       The International Technical Symposium on Navigation and Timing also
       known as the ITSNT, is an annual event organized by CNES and ENAC
       for professionals and researchers working with or interested in
       navigation and timing technologies and their use.
       This event is composed of two types of sessions:
          + "Invited Guest" sessions: special guests are invited by the
            scientific committee to give a presentation related to the
            generic topic of the session. Typically, there are 4 guest
            speakers per session, and the session ends with a round table.
          + "Peer Reviewed Paper" sessions: the presenters of these
            sessions are selected by the scientific committee based on a
            call for abstract

       The ITSNT also provides a great environment for networking and
       visiting our sponsors' exhibition stands.
       The symposium includes tutorials given by some of the invited guest
       speakers on their topic of excellence.
       The 2018 edition of the ITSNT will take place on the 13-16 Nov
       2018.
