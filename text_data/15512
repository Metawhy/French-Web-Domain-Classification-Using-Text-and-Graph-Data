   Welcome to a guide to online behavioural advertising and online
   privacy.

   On this website you'll find information about how behavioural
   advertising works, further information about cookies and the steps you
   can take to protect your privacy on the internet.

   This website is written and funded by the internet advertising industry
   and supports a pan-European industry initiative to enhance transparency
   and control for online behavioural advertising. See here for further
   details.

edaa for Companies

   The Programme is a self-regulatory initiative aimed to foster
   transparency in the online advertising environment for all, through
   delivering consumer-facing information and control solutions with
   regard to how data is used for interest based advertising. These
   solutions are self-regulatory in nature and correspond to industry best
   practice. They do not provide for or infer legal compliance (including
   with GDPR) which businesses themselves are responsible for, and should
   not be seen as such, though many companies may choose to adopt these
   self-regulatory tools as part of a broader ecology of statutory and
   self-regulatory solutions. The cross-industry self-regulatory
   initiative was developed by leading European bodies to introduce
   pan-European standards to enhance transparency and user control over
   data used for interest based advertising. This type of advertising
   increasingly helps to support the cost of providing content free at the
   point of access to consumers, and a range of services and applications
   that internet users can enjoy at little or no cost. The self-regulatory
   initiative is based upon IAB Europe's OBA Framework and EASA's BPR on
   OBA.
