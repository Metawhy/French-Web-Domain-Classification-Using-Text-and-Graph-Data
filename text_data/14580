RCR Wireless News: Telecom organizations boosting support for open source

   By craig | In The News

Organizational support for open source initiatives is easing the integration
of platforms into the telecom world.

   One key challenge for growing the support of open source into the
   telecommunications space is through various organizations that are
   looking to either bolster the use of open source or build platforms
   based on open source specifications. These efforts are seen as
   beneficial to operators and vendors looking to take advantage of open
   source platforms.

Three Chinese Carriers in OpenDaylight City Tour

   By craig | Blog

   Blog by George Zhao, originally posted here.

   On Dec. 12-16, the ODL city tour workshop was sponsored by
   OpenDaylight,  China Open SDN Committee (COS), ZTE, Huawei, H3C, Cisco,
   VCMY and Raysystem, and hosted by Baidu, Tencent, Tethrnet and SDNLAB.
   It was held in four cities of China: Nanjing, Beijing, Shenzhen and
   Shanghai, all are within a week.

   People from many technology companies joined and shared their
   experience in using ODL, the following slide is from Neela’s keynote,
   Neela listed top three companies for Internet, Telco and ICT vendors in
   China.  Internet companies, a.k.a BAT in China, are all members of COS
   and members of OpenDaylight, Tencent and Baidu are two of the four city
   hosts. All three Telco companies participated in ODL city tour and gave
   presentations. All the three ICT vendors were sponsors for this event.
   This shows a big enthusiasm for OpenDaylight in China.

   Let’s take a closer look at the three Telco’s  approaches of SDN
   controller.

   China Mobile

   According to China Mobile, after deploy SDN, the network is expected to
   be more open, more flexible and more efficient , it is true for the
   latter two, however, compare to traditional network, to many people’s
   surprise,  today’s SDN deployment makes network less open.

   In traditional networking, following IP standards, gateway, switch,
   firewall can come from different vendors, but for today’s SDN to work
   properly,  equipment needs to be from the same vendor as SDN
   controller. China Mobile’s solution to prevent vendor lock in is to
   develop SDN controller by themselves.  The best way to build a SDN
   controller is based on open source,  China Mobile selected OpenDaylight
   platform to develop their own SDN controller – AERO.

   It is hard to ignore the gap between open source community release and
   commercial product release, China Mobile summarized three key areas for
   open source SDN controller:
    1. Clustering: high performance, high available and flexible
       clustering is the key.
    2. Model: common abstract model for apps and network equipment
    3. Exception handling: how to make sure data consistence during
       exception handling.

   China Telecom

   China Telecom gave a couple of use cases of how they leveraged
   OpenDaylight in their SDN controller; IP SDN & NFV on WAN and unified
   control/management for cloud/WAN.

   While China Mobile is emphasized on southbound, China Telecom
   concentrates on northbound service plugin and Yang model, they would
   like northbound to be more abstracted, and they would like to have Yang
   model to be standardized and more mature in ODL. Their expectations of
   OpenDaylight are not very different than most of others, enhance core,
   cluster and performance.

   China Unicom

   Fast and automatic deployment is the main motivation for China Unicom
   to adapt SDN/NFV. At Shanghai, China Unicom gave an presentation of
   SDN requirements from China Unicom and Practice of ODL through
   A-Network.

   China unicom divided the controller into two layers, one is very like
   domain controller, it is vendor specific, the other is like super
   controller, it is ODL based and controls domain controllers.

   The controller in red box is Huawei controller and in blue box is Cisco
   controller, both controllers connects to their own equipment as well as
   other vendors equipment through Netconf/PCE/BGP-LS protocols. On top of
   vendor specific controllers, there is one control system, which
   controls controllers.

   Summary

   Clustering, YANG modeling, performance and stability are the common
   interests of almost everyone who participated the ODL city tour, we
   should combine the strength of community and members, to build a robust
   HA open source SDN platform that can be leveraged by many many
   companies and people.

   At last, thanks again for organizers and sponsors for this ODL city
   tour event, it has been a huge success and we keep the momentum for
   fast SDN deployment.

OpenDaylight Project Expands in China with Baidu

   By craig | Announcement

   Chinese tech giant to adopt OpenDaylight’s open SDN platform and
   rapidly deliver new AI services as mobile adoption continues to grow in
   China

   SAN FRANCISCO, December 8, 2016–The OpenDaylight Project, the leading
   open source platform for programmable, software-defined networks (SDN),
   today announced that Baidu, the leading Chinese language Internet
   search provider, has joined the project at the Silver level. This
   follows a recent announcement by Baidu to open source one of its key
   machine learning tools, PaddlePaddle, and demonstrates the company’s
   continued commitment to open source.

   Growing mobile markets in China over the past several years have
   connected more people to the Internet and opened up tremendous
   opportunities and venues for new business platforms and channel
   strategies in the region. Baidu is advancing Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) as the next stage of the Internet and is using deep learning to
   enable new technologies for autonomous driving and e-health services.
   The OpenDaylight platform will enable Baidu to optimize and automate
   their network.

   “Leveraging an open SDN platform enables us to be a more nimble
   organization and rapidly deliver new services that meet the changing
   needs and diverse interests of our users and customers,” said Liu Ning,
   System Department Deputy Director at Baidu. “We are pleased to join the
   OpenDaylight community and support OpenDaylight as the de facto
   standard for SDN.”

   Additionally, Baidu’s Liu Ning joins the OpenDaylight Advisory Group to
   provide technical and strategic guidance to the OpenDaylight Technical
   Steering Committee and OpenDaylight developer community based on the
   challenges of running a real-world network.

   China’s three biggest internet companies – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent –
   have all joined the OpenDaylight project. By leveraging the
   OpenDaylight platform to manage network agility and interoperability
   via SDN, these organizations will be better equipped to capture new
   revenue opportunities and handle the increasing demands their networks
   are facing.

   “Baidu’s contributions will be very beneficial for the OpenDaylight
   community as well as the industry as a whole,” said Neela Jacques,
   Executive Director of the OpenDaylight Project. “China is quickly
   becoming a hub for open source leadership and innovation. Baidu’s
   adoption of OpenDaylight will build on that momentum and inspire other
   Chinese companies to leverage open source technologies to drive rapid
   development, increased agility and cost savings.”

   Baidu will be hosting an OpenDaylight Workshop in Beijing on Tuesday,
   Dec. 13. The event is part of OpenDaylight Days, a series of workshops
   that will be taking place in various cities across China from Dec.
   12-16, 2016. Additional information including registration is available
   here.

   Baidu, Inc. is more than just a leading Chinese-language Internet
   search provider; its Baidu.com domain is the largest website in China
   and the fourth largest website globally while the “Baidu” brand is one
   of the highest-ranking and most valuable brands in China. The company
   is taking AI to the next stage through its deep learning technology and
   research in image recognition, speech recognition, natural language
   processing, robotics and big data. The company also serves as a media
   platform for online marketing customers.
