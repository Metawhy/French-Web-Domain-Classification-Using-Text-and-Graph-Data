New to PostgreSQL?

   PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system
   with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong
   reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

   There is a wealth of information to be found describing how to install
   and use PostgreSQL through the official documentation. The PostgreSQL
   community provides many helpful places to become familiar with the
   technology, discover how it works, and find career opportunities. Reach
   out to the community here.
