Just for Today.

   [l-101450.jpg]
   Just for Today;
   I will focus on living in the moment.
   I will be mindful to not look into the past, nor worry about the
   future.
   I will promise to only put my energy into being fully present in the
   here and now.
   I will surrender all my fears and worry to the universe, allowing only
   peace, love and tranquility within my soul.
