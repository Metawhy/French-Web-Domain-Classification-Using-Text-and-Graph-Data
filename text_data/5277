CSS fonts on Android

   I'm using @font-face to display League Gothic on a website, but it's
   not showing up on Android 1.6. Here's my code, generated with Font
   Squirrel's @font-face generator
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.eot');
    src: local('☺'), url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff') format('woff'), ur
l('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url('/fonts/League_Got
hic-webfont.svg#webfont') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

font-family:'LeagueGothicRegular',Impact,Charcoal,sans-serif;

   It's not a big deal if @font-face isn't supported (I read that
   @font-face support is gone completely in Android 2). But League Gothic
   is quite condensed, so I would like to specify a better fallback font
   for Android than the default sans-serif so the design doesn't
   completely break.

   Something like this would be perfect:
   http://www.droidfonts.com/info/droid-sans-condensed-fonts/

   But I can't find a definitive list of the default fonts that come with
   Android, and the name I should use to reference them in CSS.

   EDIT The answers so far missed the point (or I worded the question
   badly) - what I'm after is a list of system fonts that ship with
   Android. Something like this for Android.

   I've had the exact same issue trying to get webfonts to work on
   imeveryone. As of now, there doesn't seem to be anywhere on the
   internet that states this directly, so I'll do it here:

   The 'local()' syntax used to stop IE choking on file formats IE doesn't
   support also stops Android from loading fonts that Android does
   support.

   Oh dear. But it's easily fixed. The important thing is to ignore the
   'Bulletproof Font Face' local IE workaround. It's a neat hack, and
   shouldn't break Android, but it does, blame Google.

   Android does support TTF and OTF files. The proper syntax to support
   both Android and IE (and every other browser) happy is as follows.

   O 1) You need two separate style sheets for fonts, before any regular
   style sheets:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/fonts.css" />
<!--[if IE]>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styleiefonts.css}" type="text/css" charset
="utf-8" />
<![endif]-->

   O 2) In the normal style sheet, used by Android and most other
   browsers, don't use the local hack:
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
        url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
        url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.svg#webfontOTINA1xY') format('s
vg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

   O 3. In the IE specific style sheet, continue as normal:
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.eot');
}

   That's all you need to get working webfonts across all browsers. For
   now. Someday Google will fix Android and MS will fix IE, so this answer
   won't apply anymore.

   I've heard, but haven't tested myself that the "Mo' Bulletproofer"
   method developed by Richard Fink works around all these issues (IE and
   Android) without the need for double stylesheets. The syntax is:
@font-face{ /* for IE */
font-family:'LeagueGothicRegular';
src:url(fishy.eot);
}
@font-face { /* for non-IE */
font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
src:url(http://:/) format("No-IE-404"),url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff')
format('woff'), url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url(
'/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.svg#webfont') format('svg');
}

   Hope this helps!

CSS fonts on Android

   I'm using @font-face to display League Gothic on a website, but it's
   not showing up on Android 1.6. Here's my code, generated with Font
   Squirrel's @font-face generator
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.eot');
    src: local('☺'), url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff') format('woff'), ur
l('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url('/fonts/League_Got
hic-webfont.svg#webfont') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

font-family:'LeagueGothicRegular',Impact,Charcoal,sans-serif;

   It's not a big deal if @font-face isn't supported (I read that
   @font-face support is gone completely in Android 2). But League Gothic
   is quite condensed, so I would like to specify a better fallback font
   for Android than the default sans-serif so the design doesn't
   completely break.

   Something like this would be perfect:
   http://www.droidfonts.com/info/droid-sans-condensed-fonts/

   But I can't find a definitive list of the default fonts that come with
   Android, and the name I should use to reference them in CSS.

   EDIT The answers so far missed the point (or I worded the question
   badly) - what I'm after is a list of system fonts that ship with
   Android. Something like this for Android.

   I've had the exact same issue trying to get webfonts to work on
   imeveryone. As of now, there doesn't seem to be anywhere on the
   internet that states this directly, so I'll do it here:

   The 'local()' syntax used to stop IE choking on file formats IE doesn't
   support also stops Android from loading fonts that Android does
   support.

   Oh dear. But it's easily fixed. The important thing is to ignore the
   'Bulletproof Font Face' local IE workaround. It's a neat hack, and
   shouldn't break Android, but it does, blame Google.

   Android does support TTF and OTF files. The proper syntax to support
   both Android and IE (and every other browser) happy is as follows.

   O 1) You need two separate style sheets for fonts, before any regular
   style sheets:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/fonts.css" />
<!--[if IE]>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styleiefonts.css}" type="text/css" charset
="utf-8" />
<![endif]-->

   O 2) In the normal style sheet, used by Android and most other
   browsers, don't use the local hack:
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
        url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
        url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.svg#webfontOTINA1xY') format('s
vg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

   O 3. In the IE specific style sheet, continue as normal:
@font-face {
    font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
    src: url('/static/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.eot');
}

   That's all you need to get working webfonts across all browsers. For
   now. Someday Google will fix Android and MS will fix IE, so this answer
   won't apply anymore.

   I've heard, but haven't tested myself that the "Mo' Bulletproofer"
   method developed by Richard Fink works around all these issues (IE and
   Android) without the need for double stylesheets. The syntax is:
@font-face{ /* for IE */
font-family:'LeagueGothicRegular';
src:url(fishy.eot);
}
@font-face { /* for non-IE */
font-family: 'LeagueGothicRegular';
src:url(http://:/) format("No-IE-404"),url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.woff')
format('woff'), url('/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url(
'/fonts/League_Gothic-webfont.svg#webfont') format('svg');
}

   Hope this helps!

       I have tested and can confirm this works across all major browsers,
       including Android 2.2 Thanks Ethan! – mikemaccana Jan 9 '11 at

     * @nailer what you think, can i embed another language font like
       armenian or georgian font like this and show in browser text, which
