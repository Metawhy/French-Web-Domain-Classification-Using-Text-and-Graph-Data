   Zero Waste Uppsala

Do you know OLIO?

   Posted on September 2, 2019September 24, 2019 by ZeroWasteUppsala

   Zero Waste Uppsala discovered this app and loves their values!!

   It all started when a young woman named Tessa wanted to move from
   Switzerland to Great Britain. Everything was planned but unfortunately
   she ended up with some food leftovers she couldn’t finish or fit in her
   luggage. She refused to throw it away so she was looking for the woman
   who usually begs in front of the grocery store. But as fate has it, she
   wasn’t there. So Tessa was thinking, maybe her neighbours want some of
   her perfectly fresh yoghourts, cabbage or sweet potatoes? Standing in
   front of the door she didn’t dare to ring the bell, afraid of getting a
   “no”. But Tessa overcame her own fear and found a solution.

   With her new app OLIO you can get food directly to the people who want
   and need it! So now, not only Tessa but also you and your friends can
   benefit! You are leaving for some days and have some leftovers? Just
   open the app, add a photo, a description, the place and time for
   pick-up and soon your tasty leftovers find someone who values them!

   Are we all getting started? Uppsala is ready for the challenge to stop
   the food waste, right?!

   who usually begs in front of the grocery store. But as fate has it, she
   wasn’t there. So Tessa was thinking, maybe her neighbours want some of
   her perfectly fresh yoghourts, cabbage or sweet potatoes? Standing in
   front of the door she didn’t dare to ring the bell, afraid of getting a
   “no”. But Tessa overcame her own fear and found a solution.

   With her new app OLIO you can get food directly to the people who want
   and need it! So now, not only Tessa but also you and your friends can
   benefit! You are leaving for some days and have some leftovers? Just
   open the app, add a photo, a description, the place and time for
   pick-up and soon your tasty leftovers find someone who values them!

   Are we all getting started? Uppsala is ready for the challenge to stop
   the food waste, right?!

Packaging-free and local products in Uppsala

   Posted on September 1, 2019September 24, 2019 by ZeroWasteUppsala

   Still looking for a bulk shop? Or fresh local vegetables? Here we share
   all the good spots we know so far, so ENJOY!


   Bulk shops and/or local shops

   There are no packaging-free shops in Uppsala, but you can find some
   loose products at Tantens gröna skafferi: lentils, seeds, rice,
   cereals, laundry, etc.

   You can also find vegetables and beans at Svenska Delikatesser
   depending on the season. They also have Swedish products such as
   cheese, oat, meat, bread, juice, jam, surströmming, however these are
   not packaging-free.

   Kåbo växthus och trädgård is magical! There you can find flowers and
   vegetables that you can grow at home. They also sell their own organic
   vegetables!

   Almost all the supermarkets have nuts, candies, cakes and appetizers in
   bulk.


   Local markets and cooperatives

   At the end of August until October/November, there is a local market
   every Friday, from 14:00 to 18:00 in front of Uppsala central station.
   There you will find mostly vegetables and cheese. It’s the Bodens mat I
   Uppsala. You can also have a look on their facebook page.

   On facebook, there is a big group call REKO Uppsala. Each producer
   posts the products he has and costumers order and pay with swish or
   cash. The following Thursday producers and customers meet on IKEA’s
   parking during 30 minutes.

   Every Saturday there is the Torghandel på Fyristorg, from 6:00 to
   16:00. Everybody can participate, so you can find local and hand-made
   products (from vegetables to soap). In general, there is no market
   during the winter.

   Bramaten is one of them: you can choose your products online and pick
   up what you ordered the week after. They are located at Väktargatan,
   and you can find vegetables, meat, cheese, eggs, milk, kombucha, etc.

   There is also Flogstamatkooperativ. Same thing, you order vegetables,
   oat, cereals, soap, etc. one week ahead. You have to register on their
   list to become a member and order products. Below is their email:
   flogstamatkoop@transitionuppsala.se

   Ultimat is Ultunas’ mat kooperativ and you must become a member to
   order food from the associated producers.

   The different cooperatives in Uppsala are always looking for new
   volunteers, so if you want to help them GO!

   If you’re the more spontaneous type, check out the Bruised Food Club
   Uppsala for free food rescued from local supermarkets, which would
   otherwise go to waste !


   Vegetable baskets

   You can contact farms around Uppsala, some of them deliver vegetable
   baskets in Uppsala.

   Ramsjö Gård, for example, is located in Björklinge. Your basket will be
   delivered in a place close to your home where you pick it up. All their
   products are organic and they are very kind people. If you have time
   and want to help in a farm, just go there and  enjoy!

   Alsike trädgård also delivers vegetable baskets if you live close to
   centralUppsala. They deliver the basket directly to your doorstep.
   Their vegetables are also organic.


   If we forgot something, please contact us and we will add it on this
   article! Thank you for your help.

       This is wonderful! Thanks so much for publicising all this info. 🙂
       It takes a long time to get to know all this, so even better that
       it’s all in one place!
       Maybe worth also publishing it på svenska though! 😉
       I think also could be worthwhile pointing out that with the 3 food
       co-operatives in Uppsala (Ultimat, Flogsta & Bramaten) you don’t
       need to be a student to join/volunteer. Just join! They all work in
       similar ways, are well-placed around the city (with Bramaten to the
       north, Flogsta to the east & Ultimat to the south). Anyone can join
       them, and the food is often cheaper than at the supermarket (esp.
       fresh, seasonal produce). Think global, eat local! 🙂

            Hi Claudia,
            We are working on our Swedish, still looking for Swedish
            speakers for our organization (which isn’t a student one by
            the way).
            Thank you for your comment 🙂

       There’s also a little-known small, very reasonably priced market of
       freshly grown ecological vegetables, fruit, herbs, flowers and
       homemade herbal tea, at 4H gård in Gränby, and run by a small
       organisation that helps people with mental health issues, called
       Permakultur Uppsala.
       The mini-market is normally held on Friday mornings/early
       afternoon, in the season (early Sept-late October).
       Worth checking if it’s on before crossing Uppsala to get there!

       In case you haven´t yet discovered this wonderful, colourful little
       open-air market, “Torghandel på Fyristorg” as it´s known, is also a
       farmers market, and although most, if not all of the produce is
       ecological , seasonal and locally produced, it is not
       Krav-certified ecological produce (as it is at the Friday Farmers
       market). It is mainly grown/produced by local small-holders and
       allotment-holders, rather than professional farmers/bakers. This
       may not sound so up-market, but in reality it means that most of
       the produce is quite a bit cheaper at the Saturday market in
       Fyristorg (in an atmospheric old square, beside the river, under
       the cathedral), than at the Friday farmers market in front of the
       station.
       Regarding the timing, although in principle the opening times is
       6:00-16:00, in reality it´s open (in the autumn, the busiest time)
       from around 7.00-15.00, with most customers at around 10-11. Once
       the produce is sold, it´s sold, so it´s best to get there early! In
       bad weather, and with few customers later in the season it can (and
       does) close earlier.
       At other times of year (winter & spring) the market is either
       closed or else just has one or 2 brave stall holders, mainly
       selling bread, cakes and preserves, with a much shorter day
       (approx. 7.00-12.00). When the Saturday falls on a red day (public
       holiday), the market is usually transferred to the Friday instead.
       Remember the short Swedish harvesting season (August-October) means
       that there is almost nothing locally grown for most of the year,
       then a huge amount of really good quality & colourful produce for
       us to enjoy, all at once! – great if you´re a food preserver, like
       me! 😉
       One or 2 of the older stall-holders have been there, come rain or
       shine, for decades. A few years back there was even a book
       published about the market, with stall-holder interviews and
       colourful photos.
       It´s well-worth taking the time to talk to them and really get to
       know this gem of a farmers market in the heart of Uppsala.

       Hej hej, could you use any type of alcohol(spirit) which you can
       buy in Sytstem bolaget, just above 40% or do you mean just pure
       ethanol which presumably I would get from pharmacy?
       Thank you

            Hej Lucia!
            It does not have to be pure ethanol, so you can take alcohol
            from Systembolaget, but you might want to make sure the
            alcohol you get does not contain sugar or other ingredients
            that might make the spray sticky and unpleasant on your skin.
            Also, you might want to pick something that isn’t flavoured
            too intensively, so the smell of the essential oil does not
            get covered too much.

Green electronics

   Posted on June 5, 2019September 24, 2019 by ZeroWasteUppsala

   A zero-waste lifestyle incorporates many challenges. What if I REALLY
   need something that I cannot buy secondhand? When I started my journey
   to reduce the environmental and social impact of my consumption, I
   realized how far away we are from a circular economic system where
   resources remain, instead of being transferred from underground mines
   by starving and abused children, to finally end up in soil and oceans.
   Therefore, ways have to be found to shift culture and consumption into
   sustainability.

   There are many easy ways to avoid single-use items: bringing your own
   cup and towel eradicates the need for paper towels and cups, to just
   mention two. However, our life does (hopefully) not only consist of
   things we use to throw away daily. To make a raw and personal
   estimation, a person that renews his/her own laptop every 5 years,
   generates 10 trashed computers after 50 years. Without mentioning
   smartphones, headphones; adapters, cablesand chargers; TVs, monitors,
   fridges, freezers, washing machines and so on. After all, our modern
   society cannot exist without electronics. But how do we make
   electronics circular and sustainable?

   Today’s consumer electronics industry suffers from two main problems:
   Ethical and environmental impact of production and repairability. In
   order to invest our money in the best possible way, we need to purchase
   products which are easy to repair and ethical produced. So here are
   some guidelines you can follow.

   1. Don’t buy a new product
   The greenest electronics are those which are not bought. Think if you
   truly need what you plan to buy. You can stop already here. You made
   the most sustainable choice.

   2. Buy second-hand or refurbished?
   Generally, it is always a better choice to buy second hand. Keep one
   thing in mind: while second hand clothes are often given away for no
   money in return, phones and laptops are sold. Here, we should apply the
   same guidelines as buying new products to increase the value of
   circular and sustainable products on the market. Buying a modern phone
   second hand gives an incentive for the selling person to invest that
   money in a new phone. So, let’s give an incentive in the right
   direction.

   Refurbished electronics can be also a good choice. However, be aware of
   the multiple meanings and interpretations, ranging from “opened and
   sent back to the shop” to “was defective and repaired again”.The
   quality of those products can vary depending on the reseller. Besides,
   here should the same criteria for purchases apply.

   3. Buy high quality
   Independently where you buy, here are some criteria on what to buy. The
   market is flooded with cheap consumer electronics. However, we need to
   consider how long a product last. If a laptop has a market price of
   less than 5000 kr, there must be a reason why similar devices have a
   higher cost. Even if the specs (processor, display, connectivity) look
   good, the laptop might be more prone to damage due to cheap chassis or
   components. I recommend reading professional reviews in addition to
   feedback from consumers.

   Keep in mind, that certain components in a laptop, such as RAM, storage
   or Wifi card can eventually be upgraded, while many such as display,
   processor or graphics card cannot. Those components are specific for a
   certain device. It is wise to purchase higher specs in order to prolong
   the lifetime in terms of performance.

   This is especially valid for phones and tablets. They are simply not
   upgradable. Although, here you usually don’t have different options but
   rather the choice of a different phone/tablet.

   4. Check for repairability
   There are some organisations which disassemble electronics and give a
   score on how easy it is to repair the device. This is extremely
   important for circularity and how often a smartphone, laptop or tablet
   can be repaired or upgraded will most likely have the biggest impact on
   the reusability of a product.

   Try to think about or do 15 min research on how easy it is to repair a
   device. Even if, for instance, almost all new device batteries are not
   exchangeable easily, there are extreme differences in how a phone or
   laptop is engineered in order to access parts. I recommend the iFixit
   rankings which provide repairability scores, a list of the tools you
   need and score how easy it is to repair a device. Keep in mind that,
   even if you don’t repair it yourself, you might not want to pay a
   technician half of the original buying price to change a a display.

   ifixit.com/tablet-repairability
   ifixit.com/laptop-repairability

   5. Software and hardware support
   Consider which operating system the device has and how well or long it
   will be supported in the future. For laptops this is less of a problem
   therefore you are usually free to upgrade or change the OS. Even Apple
   computer which lack the support for updates at some point keep being
   usable, Windows and Linux support a computer with no set limits. In
   contrast, tablets and phones require more considerations. Here you rely
   on the manufacturer for software support. Chose a mobile OS where it
   can be expected that apps will be developed for it and also supported
   in the future. Apps like WhatsApp, Skype or Messenger require constant
   updates to remain functional. iOS or Android are necessary choices,
   especially since even Windows phone is discontinued. But it depends on
   the device itself, how long it is supported by the manufacturer. An
   iPhone 5s, for example, was released in 2013 and got support until
   2018. The first iPad however, had full software support for 2 years and
   is in 2019 close to unusable, even if the hardware requirements are
   sufficient for certain tasks. LineageOS which is based on Android works
   actively on a continuous support for phones and tablets. To my
   knowledge there is no longer lasting alternative. If you want to be
   safe, look for LineageOS support.

   6. Does the company try to reduce its impact?
   When a new phone is manufactured, many factors come into play.
   Environmental impacts such as soil poisoning, water usage or recycling
   fall into weight as well as social impacts like the source of metals,
   wages, and welfare of local workers. This diversity of factors which
   are hard to control delivers enormous challenges to companies for
   ethical and environmentally friendly manufacturing. One organization
   which tries to establish a scoring system for environment and ethics is
   the TCO certification. They rank brands and products in order to
   provide an overview which companies try to improve circularity.

   So, what to do?
   The perfect product is not yet available. However,I believe that
   considering the factors above, at least a better choice can be made.
   For example, Apple scores highest in environmental manufacturing among
   the bigger companies, although human rights remain an extreme issue in
   outsourced production facilities. But, while iPhones have a quite high
   score in repairability, MacBooks definitely do not. And if you look for
   a phone, the only recommendation I can make is FAIRPHONE which scores
   highest on repairability and ethical production among smartphones. They
   actively try to improve social and environmental impact of their
   suppliers in Congo and Nigeria. However, parts and the phones itself
   are not always available and the phone delivers outdated performance.
   But if you care about humans and positive social impact, it is the only
   choice on the smartphone market and may be the only example of a
   successful company with positive impact on sustainability in the tech
   industry.

   In the end it is your decision, as a consumer for what you spend money.
   I hope you’ll decide to make a good one.

       The argument that higher price means better quality is not always
       true. I mean that you usually buy Apple products more expensive
       than equally reliable products because you pay extra for the brand.
       But otherwise I agree with your suggestions.

       Higher price correlates with higher quality until a certain
       threshold is reached I would say. After that it can stagnate, or in
       Apple´s case quality decreases compared to other brands (macbook
       keyboards as one example) while the products still become pricier.

       Why the olive oil I wonder?

            Hi Claudia,
            sorry for the format problem and thanks for letting us know.
            We will see if we can also add just a download link for the
            pdf.
            The olive oil can be used for furniture polish, you can find
            the recipe on page 13 of the pdf.

Recipe: Spinach Lentils Salad (+ Halloumi)

   Posted on April 6, 2019September 24, 2019 by thorben

   Seasonal. Simple. Savoury.

   Do you feel the spring? It gets warmer, but it is still to early for
   gardening. However, finally cabbage time is over and before the fresh
   salad is coming in, we like to prepare the spinach. Fresh and green, it
   was supposed to contain a lot of iron, but this is unfortunately not
   truth. But Lentils have a lot of iron. Let’s combine both and prepare a
   colourful tasty salad:



   Portion: 2 person
   Time: ~ 20 minutes

   Ingedients:
     * 200 g fresh spinach
     * 1 onion
     * 100 g red lentils
     * a piece of halloumi or tofu

   For the flavour:
     * olive oil
     * honey
     * mustard
     * pepper & salt

   Step 1: Cook the Lentils

   To work efficiently, start with cooking the lentils.

   Step 2: Fry the Halloumi

   While the lentils are cooking, heat a pan for the halloumi or tofu. Cut
   the halloumi into small pieces. Mixture in a small bowl some olive oil
   with mustard and honey. When you start frying the halloumi pieces, add
   the mixture. We suggest using mid heat, so the pieces get a nice colour
   and a tasty coating.

   For a further special taste, cut the onion into rings and add them into
   the pan.


   Step 3: Wash and clean the Spinach

   While maybe the lentils still cooking and the halloumi fries with the
   onins at low/mid-heat, wash and clean the fresh spinach. Afterwards
   rupture or cut the leaves, that they are handy to eat.

   Step 4: Mix the Salad

   If everything is done, the lentils are soft and the halloumi and onions
   got a nice colour, put everything in a bowl with the spinach. Here
   again prepare another mixture with olive oil, mustard, salt, pepper and
   honey and pour it over the salad. Mix it!

   Ready to enjoy! Eat it “warm” or “cold”, you will love it!
