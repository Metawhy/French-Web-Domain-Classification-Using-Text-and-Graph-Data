Meet My Character

   Thanks to Max Everhart for tagging me in the Meet My Character Blog
   Tour. This was fun.

Snakeskin from my work in progress/ almost finished novel, Tuskaloosa.

   1) What is the name of your character? Is he/she fictional or a
   historic person?
   Rusty Jones aka Snakeskin. He’s totally fiction.
   2) When and where is the story set?
   The story is set between 1984 and 2014 along a fictional version of the
   Black Warrior River, just south of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
   3) What should we know about him/her?
   Snakeskin is a cold-hearted killer, a man that kills without thought or
   remorse. He has a thing for innocence though, and refuses to hurt
   children.
   4) What is the main conflict? What messes up his/her life?
   Snakeskin’s life was messed up from birth. His mother (before he killed
   her) was the most feared criminal in the county. When he was fourteen,
   he was bitten in the face by a water moccasin. The bite created
   necrotic tissue on his cheek, and his nickname. When he was fifteen,
   something else happened that I can’t share because it would spoil the
   entire book. But let’s just say, it changed his life and him into a
   killer.
   5) What is the personal goal of the character?
   To make the world a better place through murder and torture. Seriously.
   That’s how he thinks.
   6) Is there a working title for this novel, and can we read more about
   it?
   Tuskaloosa. I’m putting the finishing touches on it now, and then my
   agent will try to sell it.
   7) When can we expect the book to be published?
   Who knows, but hopefully soon?
   Here’s a little piece:
   I borrowed Martin’s boat the next day.  I changed my tactics and began
   asking around the Crook for Snakeskin instead of Rusty.  The responses
   changed considerably.  Everybody knew where he was, or at least claimed
   to.  Jeannie Mitchell, who still drove the same old boat with the same
   old outboard motor she’d driven when I was just a kid, told me between
   handfuls of sunflower seeds that he had a place up in Tuscaloosa now
   with “the rich a-holes.” Hank Burnside grunted at me as he worked on
   his dock.  He stood knee deep in the river, a toolbelt slung around his
   bare shoulders, trying hard to tighten a striped bolt on his slide
   before his grandkids came to visit.  “He don’t stay nowhere.  That’s by
   design.  Like a ghost on the fucking wind.  You don’t go looking for
   Snakeskin.  He’ll find you if he wants you.”  I came to Joe Chambers
   next, who looked like he was on death’s doorstep.  Liver spots all over
   his face, nothing but pure skin and bones.  He sat on his dock wetting
   a line and drinking Wild Turkey straight from the bottle.  He waved
   when he saw me, but once I began talking to him, I realized he didn’t
   remember me.  He just waved at everyone.  “Snakeskin?” he said.  “Hell,
   Snakeskin lives in his truck.  It’s geared so low, you’ll hear him
   coming from a mile away.  It’ll shake the damn road, it rumbles so
   much.”  He raised a bony finger and jabbed it at me.  “But you don’t
   want to find Snakeskin.  Hell naw.  Something in the boy’s brain ain’t
   right.  He suffers from an affliction that ain’t in no medical book.
   It’s a meanness, but it ain’t the ordinary kind.  It’s a deeper and
   uglier and more lonesome than any meanness I’ve ever seen, and when it
   comes at you, it don’t hesitate. Man moves like a panther, always a
   pounce away from introducing a man to his maker.  A man like that don’t
   remember nothing nice about life, not even from childhood the way the
   rest of us do.   Once I heard he was running with Denton Price, I saw
   his kind of meanness straight on.  What Crook kid would take up with
   the man trying to run us down to Bibb County?  Even the meanest
   sumbitch around here has some pride about his home.  But, the devils
   always do find one another.”

Updates!

   It's been a while.
   I've been busy, too busy to check in, I suppose.  But here's what you
   missed:
   -My debut novel, THE YEAR OF THE STORM, came out from Berkley.
   -My enovella, BROKEN BRANCH, came out from Penguin.
   -My agent, Beth Fleisher, retired.  That was unexpected, to say the
   least.
   -I wrote a book called TUSKALOOSA.  It's a crime novel about a
   fictional community in Alabama.
   -THE YEAR OF THE STORM was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for First
   Novel.
   -I found a new agent, Alec Shane.  He's with Writers House.  He's super
   smart and very enthusiastic about TUSKALOOSA.  With a little luck,
   you'll see it in print sooner than later.
   That's about it.  Hopefully, I'll be checking in a little more
   regularly around these parts.

Highlights from Release Day

   Yesterday was release day for The Year of the Storm.  It was also a day
   full of links and excitement surrounding the book.  Here are the
   highlights:
   Interview at Litreactor
   http://litreactor.com/interviews/10-questions-with-john-mantooth
   -This is my favorite because I really respect Keith Rawson as a
   reviewer and this is what he says about The Year of the Storm in his
   introduction:
   Debut novels are a dime a dozen; I hate to say it, but it’s a cold hard
   fact. With the sheer number of books being produced by the big 5, small
   presses, micro presses, and no presses on a daily basis, it’s near
   impossible for a first time storyteller to gain any sort of attention
   for a project they’ve slaved over their entire lives, which is a shame.
   But it is what it is, and I’m more than guilty of passing over a debut
   author because one of my standard bearers has a new novel coming out
   the same day.
   But there are debuts which immediately grab my attention and demand to
   be read, and The Year of the Stormby John Mantooth is the very
   definition of “attention grabber.” It is a flat out page turner. It is
   a rare thriller which combines elements of rural noir, supernatural
   horror, and is an intense dual coming of age story that is as
   spellbinding as anything from horror masters such as Stephen King and
   Laird Barron.
   The Year of the Storm is without question my debut novel of 2013, and
   one which I hope you’ll be willing to take a chance on.

Very Random Thoughts Four Days Before The Release of My Novel

   On Tuesday, my first novel hits the shelves.  It's something I've
   dreamed about for a very long time, certainly since high school, but
   most likely even before that.  How does it feel?  It feels good, of
   course.  It feels like I've accomplished something.  It feels like the
   end of a journey, but also the beginning.  I'm anxious, but it's the
   kind of anxiety that is a privilege, so I'll savor it rather than
   complain about it.  Mostly, I just want the day to come already.
   I'm also feeling nostalgic.  Reflective is the best way to put it, I
   suppose.  I'm thinking about my old house, the little room with the IBM
   computer, typing away on that fantasy novel that nobody bought (hell, I
   couldn't even get an agent to read the thing).  I'm remembering waiting
   in front of the IBM for an email to pop up that would tell me I had
   finally made a pro sale.  When it finally did, I felt a momentary
   twinge of pleasure and got back to work, wondering what it would feel
   like to sell a novel one day.  I imagined myself running around the
   house, screaming my head off.  I imagined a release of every tension
   I'd ever pent up, my eureka moment, my salvation from a world that was
   increasingly boring and scary to me.  When we moved to the new house, I
   started selling more short fiction. I felt momentum building, even
   while I saw so many holes in my ability, my stories, my craft.  I sold
   a story to Ellen Datlow for her Haunted Legends anthology, and this was
   the closest I ever came to my eureka moment.  I ran to the door and
   hollered for my wife.  She came running because she thought I'd been
   injured.  I was barely able to get the words out, to tell her that I'd
   sold a story to the anthology that everybody wanted to be in.  This was
   a turning point.  If I could write a short story that Ellen Datlow
   wanted, I could write a novel that one of the big six wanted.  It was
   probably a little irrational, but that's how I saw it at the time.
   When I finally did sell the novel, it wasn't like I expected it to be.
    There was no single moment when everything changed, but rather little
   ones that allowed me to gradually get used to the idea my book was
   going to be published.  First there was the call from my agent.  An
   editor wanted to talk on the phone.  Does that mean she wants to buy
   the book? I asked.  Maybe.  Maybe not, she said.  Then I was asked to
   rewrite and resubmit.  I did.  An email came.  The editor was pleased
   with the changes.  Does that mean she wants to buy the book? I texted
   my agent.  Maybe.  Maybe not, she texted back.  When it was finally
   official, I was ecstatic, but I didn't run all over the house screaming
   my head off.  Instead, I sat in a chair in my front yard (this was
   almost exactly a year ago) and soaked it all in.  I was thankful.  I
   was excited.  But I also wanted more.  I'd heard about this sort of
   thing before.  Wanting more, never being satisfied.  I believe it was
   John Rector who first told me that there's always another novel to
   write, always another goal, and that I should just enjoy the ride of
   the first one because it would never happen again.  He was right, even
   though I think I've worried far too much over the course of the year to
   actually make a case that I've been "enjoying the ride."  But it's not
   to late to start is it?
   Four more days.  I'm going to enjoy all of them.
   After that I'm going to get that next novel finished.

Four Months

   In four months, The Year of the Storm comes out from Penguin/ Berkley.
   Though it's still a ways away, I've got a few updates to report.
   First, I can finally reveal the cover...
   [81gmx2f6lUL._SL1500_.jpg]
   I'm extremely pleased with it.  What do you think?
   Speaking of extremely pleased, I also have received the first two
   blurbs for the book.
   John Rector has been a friend since I began writing back in 2002 when
   we were both publishing in little for the love magazines.  He has since
   gone on to be a bestselling author, and I've, well, I'm trying. Heh.
   Anyway, he was kind enough to read TYOTS for me and he offered this
   amazing blurb:
   "Powerful, dark, and heartfelt. The Year of the Storm is a wonderful
   coming of age novel by a very talented new writer. An astounding
   debut."
   - John Rector Wall Street Journal Bestselling Author of Already Gone,
   The Grove, and The Cold Kiss.
   Pretty cool, huh?
   The second blurb comes from Frank Bill.  If you're not familiar with
   Bill, you will be.  He's already published a universally well-regarded
   collection called Crimes in Southern Indiana, and he's got an awesome
   looking novel due out this spring from FSG called Donnybrook.  Here's
   what he had to say about TYOTS:
   “A dark and mysterious southern-gothic story with hints of Tom
   Franklin’s Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter and Stephen King’s novella
   The Body, John Mantooth’s voice is masculine and powerful, flavoring
   the pages with the Alabama wilderness, the turmoil of family and how
   all of these elements work to shape and nurture teenage boys into men.”
            -Frank Bill, author of Crimes in Southern Indiana and
   Donnybrook
   I've got to say, that one feels really good as I am a huge fan of The
   Body and Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter.  Not sure my book's in the
   class of those two, but I've never been one not to take a compliment.
   If any of this looks interesting to you, I do hope you'll consider
   preordering...

Five books I loved in 2012

   I don't know when these books were published, I only know that I read
   them in 2012 and each book, in its own way, took over my life for a
   little while (the way all good books should).  Here's the list in no
   particular order with links so you can order them!
   Dare Me- Megan Abbott
   Cheerleading goes noir.  A beautifully written novel.  I'm always in
   awe of how Abbot gets into secret worlds, in this case it's the secret
   world of cheerleaders and teenage girls.
   Volt- Alan Heathcock
   For some reason, I didn't read many collections this year.  I suppose
   it was because I was working on a novel, but this one by Heathcock
   reminded me why I love collections so much.  This guy can write, and
   though the stories are typically dark and gritty, there is an
   underlying grace that I really admired.   Well worth checking out.
   The Next Time You See Me- Holly Goddard Jones
   A gorgeous novel that switches viewpoints between characters that
   enthrall and disturb in equal measure.  I loved the middle school angle
   (I teach middle school), and this novel solidifies HGJ's status as one
   of my favorite writers.
   A Monster Calls- Patrick Ness
   I'm a sucker for novels that blend reality and fantasy so smoothly.
   Also, I think Ness nailed the teenage angst and confusion when dealing
   with a sick parent.  A fast, touching read.  Really excellent art, too.
   The Devil All the Time- Donald Ray Pollack
   A dark, dark midwestern gothic about the wages of violence.  Hell, I'd
   even classify it as straight up horror.  This book isn't for everyone,
   but if you like McCarthy, Gay, Franklin, etc., you will devour this
   one.

The Next Big Thing or A Day Late and a Tag Short

   Apologies to Bracken MacLeod (who so kindly tagged me in this blog
   tour) for dropping the ball and coming in late with my post.  I'm also
   going to be one person short, as I only managed to wrangle four of the
   five people required.
   So, rather than waste anymore time, I'll get started.
   1. What is the title of your book?
   The Year of the Storm.
   2. Where did the idea come from for the book? 
   It came from two places. First, that place inside of me that wonders
   about missing people. What about the ones who are never found? Where do
   they go? Letting my imagination run wild with that led to the book. The
   other place the book came from was a painting. It was passed down to me
   after my grandmother died, and according to the story my aunt told me,
   the artist was one of my grandmother’s sisters. My aunt described her
   as different. Quiet, withdrawn. She wrote poetry and painted. Never
   married. The painting itself reflects this kind of quiet solitude. It’s
   just a little cabin in the woods at dusk. There’s a lake nearby. A
   single light burns inside. I put it aside but never stopped thinking
   about it. Somehow, it merged with my curiosity about missing people,
   and I had the seeds of the book. If I say much more, I’ll risk giving
   stuff away, so… next question.
   3. What genre does your book fall under? 
   Southern Gothic. Is that a genre? If not, I’ll say literary horror.
   4. Which actors would you choose to play your characters in a movie
   rendition? 
   Well, the main character is fourteen, and I don’t know the name of a
   single actor that age, but the secondary character, Walter Pike, is a
   quick-tempered Vietnam vet, and I think Robert Duvall would be perfect
   for him.
   5. What is the one-sentence synopsis of your book? 
   That’s tough. How about...
   Boy tries to find his mother and Autistic sister who have disappeared
   in the Alabama woods.
   6. Will your book be self-published or represented by an agency?
   I’m represented by Beth Fleisher of Clearsailing Creatives. She’s
   great! And THE YEAR OF THE STORM comes out in June 2013 from Berkley/
   Penguin. You can preorder it here for a very discounted price.
   7. How long did it take you to write the first draft of your
   manuscript?
   First draft probably took about eight months. The other drafts took
   about two years.
   8. What other books would you compare this story to within your genre?
   That’s tough. Beverly Bambury was kind of enough to read this for me
   when it was in the final editing stages and she compared it to Boy's
   Life by Robert McCammon (which I love) and The Thief of Time by Clive
   Barker (which I’ve never read).
    9. Who or What inspired you to write this book?
   See answer #2
   10. What else about your book might pique the reader’s interest?
   Well, as you might expect from a book titled THE YEAR OF THE STORM,
   there’s a lot of bad weather in there. And ghosts. Murder too. Oh, why
   don’t I just say it? There’s something for everyone.
   I've tagged four others that will posting on their respective blogs
   sometime next week.  First up is the inimitable Sam W. Anderson.  I've
   known Sam since 2006, and not only is he a phenomenally talented
   writer, he's also one of the true nice guys in the business.  Do check
   out his Money Run stories here.
   Next is Usman Tanveer Malik.  I met Usman at the Horror Library on
   Zoetrope.  He's been extraordinarily supportive of my writing, and I
   hope to be able to return the favor to him one day. He doesn't have a
   lot out there right now, but I have a feeling that's going to change
   soon.
   Speaking of supportive, I've also tagged Erik Smetana.  Many of you
   probably know Erik as the editor of the sports infused journal, Stymie,
   but Erik is also a very talented writer in his own right.  I'm looking
   forward to seeing what he's working on next week.
   Finally, I'd like to introduce Danny Evarts.  He's not a writer.  He's
   an artist.  And a damn good one too.  I know because Danny did the
   interiors for my collection, Shoebox Train Wreck, and if you've seen
   the book, you've seen how amazing they are.  Like all the others I've
   tagged, Danny is one of the good guys, and I'd love to work with him
   again.
   Well, that's it.  Go ahead and check out the other blogs and be on the
   look out for their posts on Dec. 12.

Meet My Character

   Thanks to Max Everhart for tagging me in the Meet My Character Blog
   Tour. This was fun.

Snakeskin from my work in progress/ almost finished novel, Tuskaloosa.

   1) What is the name of your character? Is he/she fictional or a
   historic person?
   Rusty Jones aka Snakeskin. He’s totally fiction.
   2) When and where is the story set?
   The story is set between 1984 and 2014 along a fictional version of the
   Black Warrior River, just south of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
   3) What should we know about him/her?
   Snakeskin is a cold-hearted killer, a man that kills without thought or
   remorse. He has a thing for innocence though, and refuses to hurt
   children.
   4) What is the main conflict? What messes up his/her life?
   Snakeskin’s life was messed up from birth. His mother (before he killed
   her) was the most feared criminal in the county. When he was fourteen,
   he was bitten in the face by a water moccasin. The bite created
   necrotic tissue on his cheek, and his nickname. When he was fifteen,
   something else happened that I can’t share because it would spoil the
   entire book. But let’s just say, it changed his life and him into a
   killer.
   5) What is the personal goal of the character?
   To make the world a better place through murder and torture. Seriously.
   That’s how he thinks.
   6) Is there a working title for this novel, and can we read more about
   it?
   Tuskaloosa. I’m putting the finishing touches on it now, and then my
   agent will try to sell it.
   7) When can we expect the book to be published?
   Who knows, but hopefully soon?
   Here’s a little piece:
   I borrowed Martin’s boat the next day.  I changed my tactics and began
   asking around the Crook for Snakeskin instead of Rusty.  The responses
   changed considerably.  Everybody knew where he was, or at least claimed
   to.  Jeannie Mitchell, who still drove the same old boat with the same
   old outboard motor she’d driven when I was just a kid, told me between
   handfuls of sunflower seeds that he had a place up in Tuscaloosa now
   with “the rich a-holes.” Hank Burnside grunted at me as he worked on
   his dock.  He stood knee deep in the river, a toolbelt slung around his
   bare shoulders, trying hard to tighten a striped bolt on his slide
   before his grandkids came to visit.  “He don’t stay nowhere.  That’s by
   design.  Like a ghost on the fucking wind.  You don’t go looking for
   Snakeskin.  He’ll find you if he wants you.”  I came to Joe Chambers
   next, who looked like he was on death’s doorstep.  Liver spots all over
   his face, nothing but pure skin and bones.  He sat on his dock wetting
   a line and drinking Wild Turkey straight from the bottle.  He waved
   when he saw me, but once I began talking to him, I realized he didn’t
   remember me.  He just waved at everyone.  “Snakeskin?” he said.  “Hell,
   Snakeskin lives in his truck.  It’s geared so low, you’ll hear him
   coming from a mile away.  It’ll shake the damn road, it rumbles so
   much.”  He raised a bony finger and jabbed it at me.  “But you don’t
   want to find Snakeskin.  Hell naw.  Something in the boy’s brain ain’t
   right.  He suffers from an affliction that ain’t in no medical book.
   It’s a meanness, but it ain’t the ordinary kind.  It’s a deeper and
   uglier and more lonesome than any meanness I’ve ever seen, and when it
   comes at you, it don’t hesitate. Man moves like a panther, always a
   pounce away from introducing a man to his maker.  A man like that don’t
   remember nothing nice about life, not even from childhood the way the
   rest of us do.   Once I heard he was running with Denton Price, I saw
   his kind of meanness straight on.  What Crook kid would take up with
   the man trying to run us down to Bibb County?  Even the meanest
   sumbitch around here has some pride about his home.  But, the devils
   always do find one another.”

Updates!

   It's been a while.
   I've been busy, too busy to check in, I suppose.  But here's what you
   missed:
   -My debut novel, THE YEAR OF THE STORM, came out from Berkley.
   -My enovella, BROKEN BRANCH, came out from Penguin.
   -My agent, Beth Fleisher, retired.  That was unexpected, to say the
   least.
   -I wrote a book called TUSKALOOSA.  It's a crime novel about a
   fictional community in Alabama.
   -THE YEAR OF THE STORM was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for First
   Novel.
   -I found a new agent, Alec Shane.  He's with Writers House.  He's super
   smart and very enthusiastic about TUSKALOOSA.  With a little luck,
   you'll see it in print sooner than later.
   That's about it.  Hopefully, I'll be checking in a little more
   regularly around these parts.

Highlights from Release Day

   Yesterday was release day for The Year of the Storm.  It was also a day
   full of links and excitement surrounding the book.  Here are the
   highlights:
   Interview at Litreactor
   http://litreactor.com/interviews/10-questions-with-john-mantooth
   -This is my favorite because I really respect Keith Rawson as a
   reviewer and this is what he says about The Year of the Storm in his
   introduction:
   Debut novels are a dime a dozen; I hate to say it, but it’s a cold hard
   fact. With the sheer number of books being produced by the big 5, small
   presses, micro presses, and no presses on a daily basis, it’s near
   impossible for a first time storyteller to gain any sort of attention
   for a project they’ve slaved over their entire lives, which is a shame.
   But it is what it is, and I’m more than guilty of passing over a debut
   author because one of my standard bearers has a new novel coming out
   the same day.
   But there are debuts which immediately grab my attention and demand to
   be read, and The Year of the Stormby John Mantooth is the very
   definition of “attention grabber.” It is a flat out page turner. It is
   a rare thriller which combines elements of rural noir, supernatural
   horror, and is an intense dual coming of age story that is as
   spellbinding as anything from horror masters such as Stephen King and
   Laird Barron.
   The Year of the Storm is without question my debut novel of 2013, and
   one which I hope you’ll be willing to take a chance on.

Very Random Thoughts Four Days Before The Release of My Novel

   On Tuesday, my first novel hits the shelves.  It's something I've
   dreamed about for a very long time, certainly since high school, but
   most likely even before that.  How does it feel?  It feels good, of
   course.  It feels like I've accomplished something.  It feels like the
   end of a journey, but also the beginning.  I'm anxious, but it's the
   kind of anxiety that is a privilege, so I'll savor it rather than
   complain about it.  Mostly, I just want the day to come already.
   I'm also feeling nostalgic.  Reflective is the best way to put it, I
   suppose.  I'm thinking about my old house, the little room with the IBM
   computer, typing away on that fantasy novel that nobody bought (hell, I
   couldn't even get an agent to read the thing).  I'm remembering waiting
   in front of the IBM for an email to pop up that would tell me I had
   finally made a pro sale.  When it finally did, I felt a momentary
   twinge of pleasure and got back to work, wondering what it would feel
   like to sell a novel one day.  I imagined myself running around the
   house, screaming my head off.  I imagined a release of every tension
   I'd ever pent up, my eureka moment, my salvation from a world that was
   increasingly boring and scary to me.  When we moved to the new house, I
   started selling more short fiction. I felt momentum building, even
   while I saw so many holes in my ability, my stories, my craft.  I sold
   a story to Ellen Datlow for her Haunted Legends anthology, and this was
   the closest I ever came to my eureka moment.  I ran to the door and
   hollered for my wife.  She came running because she thought I'd been
   injured.  I was barely able to get the words out, to tell her that I'd
   sold a story to the anthology that everybody wanted to be in.  This was
   a turning point.  If I could write a short story that Ellen Datlow
   wanted, I could write a novel that one of the big six wanted.  It was
   probably a little irrational, but that's how I saw it at the time.
   When I finally did sell the novel, it wasn't like I expected it to be.
    There was no single moment when everything changed, but rather little
   ones that allowed me to gradually get used to the idea my book was
   going to be published.  First there was the call from my agent.  An
   editor wanted to talk on the phone.  Does that mean she wants to buy
   the book? I asked.  Maybe.  Maybe not, she said.  Then I was asked to
   rewrite and resubmit.  I did.  An email came.  The editor was pleased
   with the changes.  Does that mean she wants to buy the book? I texted
   my agent.  Maybe.  Maybe not, she texted back.  When it was finally
   official, I was ecstatic, but I didn't run all over the house screaming
   my head off.  Instead, I sat in a chair in my front yard (this was
   almost exactly a year ago) and soaked it all in.  I was thankful.  I
   was excited.  But I also wanted more.  I'd heard about this sort of
   thing before.  Wanting more, never being satisfied.  I believe it was
   John Rector who first told me that there's always another novel to
   write, always another goal, and that I should just enjoy the ride of
   the first one because it would never happen again.  He was right, even
   though I think I've worried far too much over the course of the year to
   actually make a case that I've been "enjoying the ride."  But it's not
   to late to start is it?
   Four more days.  I'm going to enjoy all of them.
   After that I'm going to get that next novel finished.
