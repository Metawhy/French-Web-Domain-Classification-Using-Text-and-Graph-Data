   files, fixing broken shortcuts, and resolving a wide range of issues,
   both major and minor, that most Windows users will have no trouble
   recognizing. You can configure its One-Click Maintenance option to run
   just those processes you want with a single click, making regular

   tools individually, too

Media Review

   Disk SpeedUp features a nicely designed interface and is very easy to
   use. The program works with all main file systems and has support for
   scheduled scans as well. And besides the basic defrag functionality,
   Disk SpeedUp also includes an optimization tool â which is slower, but
   offers better results.
