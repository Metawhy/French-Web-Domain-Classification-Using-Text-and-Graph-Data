Privacy policy

   This specific section is devoted to Gamned! policy on the protection of
   personal data and privacy. Protection of personal data and respect for
   privacy are priorities for Gamned! The company participates and
   supports initiatives in favor of transparency towards users, on
   collection and processing of personal data and concerning the use of
   cookies on Internet

IAB (Europe) et YOC (YourOnlineChoices)

   Gamned! is an active member of the Interactive Advertising Bureau
   (IAB), association of advertising producers on the web, and is a
   signatory to the European Charter on Online Behavioral Advertising,
   which lays down ethical principles for behavioral advertising.
   As a signatory, Gamned! integrates the Adchoices Icon (« choose your
   advertising ») on all targeting advertisements it generates.
   Gamned! follows recommandations of YourOnlineChoice plateform (YOC)
   which allows users to disable any cookies that Gamned! and other member
   companies have placed on their computer.

1. Data collection

   Gamned! works on behalf of its advertising clients and thus operates as
   a subcontractor within the meaning of Law n°78-17- of January, 6th,
   1978. The objective of Gamned! and its advertising clients is to
   present the most relevent messages to consumers. A personalized message
   is designed based on users’ browsing and preferences that are shared
   with the advertiser. To this end, cookie technology enables the real
   time determination of the right message to display.

   Use of cookies
   A cookie is a text file that can be saved in a terminal when consulting
   an online service with a browser. A cookie file allows the issuer –
   during the period of validity of the cookie – to recognize the terminal
   concerned whenever accessing digital content including cookies of the
   same issuer. Cookies are used to:
     *
          +
               o compile statistics on traffic volume and use of targeted
                 contents, services or information browsed by the user;
               o count the total number of displayed advertisements and,
                 if applicable, the subsequent actions taken by users on
                 the pages carrying the ads to compile statistics;
               o adapt advertising space terminal display preferences
                 (language, screen resolution, operating system, etc.),
                 according to hardware and display or playback software it
                 includes;
               o adapt advertising contents displayed on terminal,
                 according to personal data provided by the user,
               o enable advertisers to collect more information about the
                 performance of their advertising campaigns and improve
                 over time.

   When displaying advertising contents, information relating users
   browsing – regardless of the terminal (computer, tablet, smartphone) –
   are likely to be stored in the cookie files installed on the terminal,
   subject to user agreement.

   Personal and contextual data
   Personal data are information that help identify directly (name, first
   name) or indirectly (social security number, customer number, IP
   address) an individual. They can be either nominative, such as the CRM
   databasis of an advertiser, or non-nominative, when the piece of data
   is linked to a cookie or an IP address. Personal data used by data
   marketing are of three types : (1) contextual data, linked to user
   browsing, geolocalisation, and the context of the sites viewed; (2)
   data owned by the advertiser or « 1st party data » such as CRM
   databasis; (3) external data or « 3rd party data » provided by
   specialized third parties, providing data such as user
   socio-professional category, purchasing intentions or interests. As
   part of marketing campaigns conducted on behalf of its advertising
   clients, Gamned! is likely to combine data from different sources,
   while respecting its clients privacy policies.

   Why displaying advertisements adapted to consumer browsing?
   Consumers are more likely to show interest in advertising contents that
   are targeted for them according to their needs and preferences. As a
   matter of fact, our clients also want to advertise to audiences that
   are actually interested in what they have to offer.
   Moreover, revenues from advertising enable users to enjoy free access
   to online contents and services.

2. Gamned! and users

   When Gamned! collects data and/or display advertising campaigns, it
   acts only under the instructions of its advertising client. The latter
   is indeed responsible for data processing – within the meaning of the
   low 78-17 of January, 6th 1978 – as it is the one that determines
   purposes and means of the whole process. However, Gamned! agrees not to
   take any action which goes againsi the legislation on personal data
   treatment and, doing so, commits to what is mentionned hereinafter.
   Gamned! does not collect any information called « sensitive »
   (religion, political opinion, health, etc.) Gamned! does not create any
   segments to target specifically children under the age of 13. Gamned!
   only collects through cookies anonymous data that record: (1) browsing
   events on client’s websites and partners; (2) events linked to Gamned!
   advertisements display.
   Gamned! never crosses its clients customer information. Gamned! does
   not collect or use external data (« 3rd party data ») unless you have
   authorized a specific third party provider to transmit your data.

3. Enabling or rejecting cookies

   Several possibilities are offered to users to manage cookies. Any
   settings they choose will be likely to change their internet browsing
   and terms of access to services requiring the use of cookies. Users can
   choose at any time to amend their preferences regarding cookies, by the
   means described below:
   Choices offered by browsers
   It is possible to configure one’s browser so that cookies are enabled
   in the terminal or, on the contrary, are disabled, either
   systematically or by the issuer. Users can also configure their browser
   so that enabling or disabling cookies is occasionally suggested, before
   a cookie is likely to be stored in their terminal.
   (a) Enabling cookies in one’s terminal is essentially subordinated to
   the will of its user, who can, at any time and for free, amend its
   preferences regarding the use of cookies in the setting options of its
   browser. If one enables cookies on his terminal, cookies embedded in
   the pages and contents viewed may be temporarily stored in a dedicated
   area of the terminal. They will be readable by the issuer only.
   (b) Disabling cookies If the user disables and clear cookies in the
   terminal, he will not benefit anymore from a number of features which
   are nevertheless necessary to online browsing. If all cookies are
   cleared by the user, its preferences regarding cookies will not be
   saved anymore.
