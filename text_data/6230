   Early projects
   Work in progress
   Testament

   I here declare, for every eventuality, that I leave everything that I
   possess to an administrative entity, the “Fondation Le Corbusier”, or
   any other meaningful form, which shall become a spiritual entity, that
   is, a continuation of the endeavour pursued throughout a lifetime.

                                                              Le Corbusier
                                                Note dated 13 January 1960

   While still only in his infancy as an architect and budding artist,
   Charles-Edouard Jeanneret was already at an early age showing a will to
   achieve ambitious aims and a desire to leave behind him significant
   traces of his endeavour that would outlast his earthly existence. “Let
   life be something with a goal and not merely an arrow speeding toward
   death” he wrote to his parents in 1910.

   Having become Le Corbusier, without direct heirs and driven by the fear
   that his carefully conserved archives and works be scattered after his
   death, he spent the last fifteen years of his life conceiving and
   implementing, down to its smallest details, the project of a Foundation
   that would bear his name.

   Already in 1949, he had written, in a letter addressed to his friend
   Jean-Jacques Duval, for whom he built the Duval factory in Saint-Dié:

   One can conk out at any time of life. I’ve been talking about it to my
   brother who is here on a visit. With my wife’s agreement, I have
   arranged to leave what I own to the poor.
   Now, what I own can at best be used as something to light the fire
   with. Here at 24 rue Nungesser et Coli (and even at 35 Sèvres in a
   cellar), I have substantial archives of all kinds: drawings, writings,
   notes, travel diaries, albums, etc. I don’t want some hooligan happily
   pillaging it all, and destroying series whose value depends on their
   being complete.
   In other words, we’ll have to take a look at my archives so as to make
   the most of them (to sell them, or give them to people, institutions or
   museums).
   Conclusion: the aim of this letter is to set you thinking and to
   request you – when the time comes –to take immediate possession, or
   rather, immediate control of my archives, so as to protect them from
   being wrongfully scattered.
   And the present letter, with my signature, is to be used as documentary
   proof, for whatever purpose it may serve.

   With my friendship and my gratitude.

   Early projects
   Work in progress
   Testament

   Heavily involved in the big building commissions that got under way at
   the beginning of the fifties, Le Corbusier, although still concerned
   with his project for a Foundation, no longer had much time to devote to
   it. It was only in 1957, shortly before his 70th birthday, that he
   started thinking about it again in more precise terms. In a series of
   letters exchanged with his friend the banker Jean-Pierre de Montmollin,
   he requested the latter’s advice on determining the legal status of the
   future Foundation. He informed him of his intentions in a letter dated
   1 October 1957:

   To pursue the question of the Fondation Le Corbusier, I am sending you
   here the decisions taken with my brother Albert on his visit last
   Sunday, 29 September.
     * We have agreed that the little maison du Lac, and the land
       belonging to it, which, as our father’s heirs, are our jointly held
       property (under Swiss law), could be made over directly to the
       Foundation, envisaged as having its legal business address in
       Switzerland, to facilitate the succession or the inheritance.
     * This little house would also be used as the “Fondation Albert
       Jeanneret”, in which the considerable quantity of Albert
       Jeanneret’s manuscripts would be conserved and which would be
       authorised to publish his musical works at any time in the future.
     * We need to find the relevant stratagem for divesting our two
       individuals, Albert Jeanneret and Le Corbusier, of the instant
       ownership of the house (in case of one or the other’s decease),
       since we have no valid inheritors.
     * And what’s more, something that is always to be feared for old
       gentlemen of our age is falling into the clutches of femmes fatales
       with exaggerated ideas about people’s fortunes and capable, with
       the talents Nature has given them, of twisting round their little
       fingers one or other of the septuagenarians in question. In other
       words, use this provisional deed of donation as a sharp curb to
       take the wind out of any stranger’s sails. That’s what they call
       the prudence and wisdom of nations!

   I mean this very seriously and I think it essential that these two
   steps should be taken right away - the donation of the maison du Lac
   and that of the house in the Square du Docteur Blanche.

   In making his project a reality, Le Corbusier very rapidly sought the
   help of Gabriel Chéreau, a lawyer from Nantes and the legal consultant
   who had defended him in the Marseilles trial and obtained for him the
   commission for the Unité d’habitation in Rezé. His job was to find an
   ideal legal set-up for the Foundation and to draw up its statutes. Le
   Corbusier also called upon the skills of other outside experts,
   Alphonse Ducret, an engineer and the President of the Fédération
   Internationale du Bâtiment, as well as his lawyer, Maître Maguet.

   The archives left by Le Corbusier attest to the increasing importance
   this project was taking in his life: letters to his friends, to state
   officials, to foreign dignitaries; notes in his carnets, various traces
   on sheets of paper or cards (invitations, menus or programmes), texts
   typed in the Atelier, handwritten letters sent from
   Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, meetings in the apartment in rue Nungesser et
   Coli ...

   Early projects
   Work in progress
   Testament

   Le Corbusier had begun by defining his conception of the Foundation’s
   missions at a very early stage, but he still had to draw up a timetable
   of the legal steps needed for it to become a reality at the appointed
   time. There were now four major points that were to focus all his
   attention and that of his friends.
     * Their most immediate task was to define a legal status, which would
       ensure both the Foundation’s coming into being and its permanence,
       and provide it with the necessary resources for accomplishing its
       missions. The main subject of his preliminary study was the tax
       question, but it also confirmed the advantage to be gained from
       conceiving of the Foundation as a testamentary body after the death
       of its founder. To begin with, however, this solution meant
       provisionally forming an association with the job of ensuring a
       transition/transfer in legal and material conditions that were
       sound.
     * It was equally important to find premises to house the different
       activities of the Foundation. The project required office
       accommodation for a secretariat, exhibition and meeting spaces as
       well as a building for stocking archives and a large collection of
       works of art. The Foundation would have at its disposal the
       apartment at 24 rue Nungesser et Coli and the Maison du Lac at
       Corseaux, which were obviously part of its heritage, but not
       adapted to the needs of the future institution.

   Le Corbusier then began negotiations on two different fronts. On one
   hand, he succeeded in persuading his friend Raoul La Roche, for whom he
   had built the house in Square du Docteur Blanche and who had no direct
   heirs, to donate the house to the Foundation. On the other, in his
   talks with André Malraux on the restoration and future attribution of
   Villa Savoye, which had just been saved from demolition, he proposed to
   turn it into an international centre housing the Fondation Le
   Corbusier.

   Between 1957, the year of the conversation with La Roche about donating
   the house and 1964, when the transactions were finally concluded, Le
   Corbusier studied several possibilities for locating the Foundation’s
   headquarters. The different schemes all included the Musée National
   d’Art Moderne, where a large part of his collection of paintings was
   deposited. Thus, in one of these schemes, he planned to present a
   selection of works in Villa Savoye ("Musée Corbu"), with the
   Foundation’s secretariat being housed in Maison La Roche. Paintings,
   sculptures and drawings would have been stored by the Musée d’Art
   Moderne. The role that this institution might play in the project was
   the subject of numerous discussions with its two curators, who had been
   closely following Le Corbusier’s work, Bernard Dorival et Maurice
   Besset.

   On 3 July 1959, after an exchange of letters lasting several months, Le
   Corbusier sent a handwritten letter to La Roche to thank him for
   formally confirming the donation of his house in Square du Docteur
   Blanche to the Fondation Le Corbusier.

   On this occasion you and I are accomplishing a material and moral act
   expressing our mutual respect and our faith in art. Your life and mine
   alike have been inspired by it
   . After my time, the Fondation Le Corbusier will prolong the research I
   have devoted myself to; giving this foundation a roof will consecrate
   the friendship that brought us together in a far-away and … heroic
   time.

   In 1962 he was concerned by the fate of Maison Jeanneret, also located
   in Square du Docteur Blanche, and whose links with Maison La Roche he
   wished to preserve. The house, formerly occupied by his brother Albert,
   was no longer part of the family heritage and was about to be involved
   in transactions in which Le Corbusier had no say. In the end, Maison
   Jeanneret, which today houses the Foundation’s offices and its resource
   centre, was acquired in 1970 only, through the sale of a painting by
   Picasso belonging to the Foundation’s collection.
     * Le Corbusier then had to give the future Foundation the means to
       achieve one of its main tasks, that of ensuring the handing on of
       his artistic and intellectual œuvre.
       For this purpose he desired to draw up before his death the list of
       members of the future Governing Board of the Foundation. The first
       list of names appeared in 1961. It was constantly to be modified,
       depending on his changes of mood, advice from others and, with
       time, people just naturally dying off. Names were scribbled down in
       notebooks, lists exchanged in letters.
       In 1962 several prestigious foreign candidates were added to the
       names of friends and close associates: Boesiger, Gropius, Costa,
       Sert, Rogers, Candilis, Nervi… Le Corbusier was concerned to widen
       the circle of the Foundation’s loyal supporters and to obtain
       through an international network the support and the resources
       needed to run it.
       When the Association for the Fondation le Corbusier was formed in
       1962, new lists of names appeared, this time for the management
       committee. From the outset it was decided that Raoul La Roche would
       be its Honorary President.
     * Lastly, the Foundation was to encourage the recognition and the
       dissemination of Le Corbusier’s plastic creations. It was thus
       necessary to draw up an inventory of pieces due to become part of
       the Foundation’s collections and to contribute to improving
       knowledge of this aspect of Le Corbusier’s work, which he
       considered to be unfairly neglected by the public.
       In a note dated 6 November 1957, Le Corbusier therefore drew up a
       preliminary inventory of pictures of his that were either in
       circulation, deposited in French or foreign galleries or museums,
       or stored in his studio. He planned to make "a list of 20 available
       pictures, representative of [his] pictorial work, to be exhibited
       at the Paris headquarters of the Foundation". And in the margin he
       added: "in maison La Roche, 20 of them could be hung."
       This list was to be added to over the years through more or less
       detailed inventories of his personal collection, emphasizing both
       its variety and its unity (papiers collés, copper-plate engravings,
       tapestries, lithographs, enamels, etc.). He was troubled when
       paintings of his that had been deposited at the Musée National
       d’Art Moderne were returned to the Foundation in 1963, together
       with fifteen paintings by André Bauchant. He was also anxious to
       find fireproof housing for the plans of the Atelier at 35 rue de
       Sèvres.
