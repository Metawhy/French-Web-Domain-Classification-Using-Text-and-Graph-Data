   The shock exit of two high-level HSBC executives within a week,
   including its top executive and the head of key China business, has put
   the 150-year-old, London-based banking giant under public scrutiny and
   mounting speculations.
   Late on Monday, Europe's biggest bank issued a Chinese statement on its
   official WeChat account, denying media reports that linked the
   resignations of its two executives with shareholder pressure over
   external affairs.
   HSBC said these reports are "baseless rumors."
   The statement came as China's Ping An Insurance, the largest HSBC
   shareholder, was reported to have been a major promoter of the two
   executives' resignations.
   Ping An Insurance overtook New York-based BlackRock, the world's
   biggest asset manager, to become the largest shareholder of HSBC in
   November last year, with a stake of over 7 percent.
   A person close to Ping An refuted the reports, telling the Global Times
   on Monday that, "It is only those media that want to make hype and
   attract attention."
   Ping An clarified on Tuesday morning that it does not engage in the
   daily operations and management of HSBC, saying its investment in the
   bank is "purely financial investment."
   This also comes amid the bank's alleged involvement in the US'
   investigation into Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. While HSBC
   has stressed that the top management change "has no relation" with the
   Huawei issue.
   "We will continue to contribute to the economic prosperity of the
   Chinese mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," HSBC
   said in the Monday statement.
   Surprise reshuffle
   On Friday, HSBC Holdings' Greater China Chief Executive Helen Wong
   resigned from her position, marking the second exit of a senior
   executive from the bank within a week. Wong, who joined the company in
   1992, decided to leave to "pursue an external opportunity," according
   to HSBC's spokesperson.
   Wong's vacancy will not be filled. Instead, the position will be
   eliminated and the four regional chiefs who previously worked under
   Wong will continue to collaborate.
   Just days before, after only 18 months in the role, John Flint stepped
   down from his post as Group Chief Executive, and as a director, after
   "mutual agreement with the Board," according HSBC's statement on August
   5.
   He was replaced by interim chief Noel Quinn. The bank stated that, "In
   the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which
   the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the
   challenges that we face and to capture the very significant
   opportunities before us."
   After almost 3 decades with HSBC, Flint was quoted in the statement to
   have said, "I will be sad to leave but I do so looking forward to a new
   personal challenge, and confident that our people will continue to
   serve the Bank's stakeholders in the best possible way."
   The surprise announcement comes amid HSBC's report of a solid 15.8
   percent rise in pretax profits to $12.4 billion in the first six months
   of 2019. The bank announced a further stock buyback of $1 billion,
   which defied "some analysts' expectations it might pause its strategy
   of returning extra capital to investors," Reuters reported.
   An anonymous insider told the Global Times that he considers the move
   to be the result of an internal reason, as some top-level disagreements
   emerged during Flint's management. The insider refused to disclose more
   details.
   Despite the company's statement, the shock departure of two top
   executives within a week still brews speculations that the move might
   be related to external issues.
   "There must be some relations, even [if Huawei] is not the main
   reason," an industry insider told the Global Times.
   Huawei woes
   Dong Shaopeng, an advisor for the China Securities Regulatory
   Commission, told the Global Times on Monday that the consecutive
   changes at HSBC's executive level are likely related to the arrest of
   Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada.
   The bank has helped lead US charges against Huawei, as it was
   attempting to convince the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to dismiss
   criminal charges for the bank's own misconduct involving US sanctions,
   Reuters reported in February.
   A source close to the matter told the Global Times previously that the
   manner in which HSBC helped the DOJ acquire documents against Huawei
   was unethical, as the bank gave out its clients' confidential
   information in pursuit of its own interests.
   HSBC's assistance with the US prosecutors' charge against Huawei, which
   has far exceeded its normal business sphere, has proved the company's
   obedience to US hegemony or so-called "long-arm jurisdiction,"
   according to Dong, who added that the issue has harmed HSBC's integrity
   and morality.
   China has been consistent in its opening-up by welcoming foreign
   capital investment, but for those who have enjoyed the dividends of
   China's reform and opening-up policy over the past decades yet turned
   their backs or worked against China's national interests, they deserve
   criticism and punishment, Dong said.
   Growing numbers of Chinese internet users are calling for HSBC's
   addition to China's blacklist, as the unreliable entity list is still
   being drafted.
   Some have also said that HSBC should be one of the first companies
   placed on the list.
   Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying, when asked at a
   press conference in early August to comment on the possibility that
   HSBC will be added to the blacklist, said that the list is still
   undergoing relevant procedures.
   HSBC has been lobbying the Chinese government to absolve it of any
   blame for Meng's arrest, saying it had no choice but to cooperate with
   the investigation and provide information that US authorities needed to
   build a case against Huawei, according to media reports.
   Chaos ahead
   Other than the alleged illegal role it played in the arrest of Huawei's
   CFO, which cast a shadow on its mainland businesses, insiders cautioned
   that the UK-based lender also faces other challenges amid rising global
   uncertainties such as the UK's Brexit and the China-US trade war, as
   well as the unrest in Hong Kong.
   About 80 percent of HSBC's earnings come from Asia, and Hong Kong alone
   provides the bank with about half of its pretax profits, according to a
   Bloomberg report.
   A person close the bank told the Global Times on Tuesday that the
   company is currently making efforts to cut costs.
   Meanwhile, outlook for global investment in the banking sector has also
   soured, with almost 30,000 layoffs announced since April, citing
   reasons such as "falling interest rates, weak trading volumes and the
   march of automation," the Financial Times reported on Monday.
   HSBC revealed it would axe 2 percent of its global workforce - more
   than 4,000 employees - last week.
   "The company badly needs new faces to change the current frustration or
   chaos it is currently facing - geopolitical factors or internal
   organization adjustments," Dong said.

   The so-called apology from Hong Kong protesters for brutally injuring a
   reporter and tourist from the mainland at Hong Kong airport was
   rejected fiercely by politicians, scholars and mainlanders as a
   hypocritical move that showed no signs of remorse.
   The illegal and violent behavior at Hong Kong International Airport on
   Tuesday night sparked wide condemnation and criticism from authorities
   and the public.
   Fu Guohao, a reporter from the Global Times website, who was brutally
   attacked by rioters while performing reporting tasks, is being treated
   at hospital.
   Facing the strong backlash, some protesters began posting statements on
   overseas social media, saying they were sorry and the move was made as
   they were "too scared."
   Protesters wearing masks held banners at the airport on Wednesday which
   read "We are desperate and we made imperfect decisions. Please accept
   our apology," according to media reports.
   The statement was slammed as a hypocritical action to win support from
   Hong Kong society, which saw an increasing number of people standing up
   to denounce the violence of radical protesters.
   "You mean you are 'too scared' so that you confined, hit and insulted
   the reporter in groups? And now you want to play the victim after you
   told government officials to die, attacked police with lethal weapons
   and paralyzed the operation of social organizations," posted one user
   of China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo platform, calling the statement a
   "masterpiece" of hypocrisy.
   "I don't understand the point of their so-called apology. What they
   should do is to end the farce and stop spreading conflicts," a student
   from the University of Hong Kong told the Global Times.
   The Hong Kong police said Wednesday that they had arrested five people
   involved in unlawful assembly at the airport Tuesday night, during
   which two residents from the mainland were assaulted and unlawfully
   detained. The arrested include two suspected of assaulting police and
   possessing offensive weapons.
   Shen Yi, a professor at the school of international relations and
   public affairs in Fudan University, Shanghai, said the statement is
   "more of a hypocritical move to redeem the image of the egoist than an
   apology."
   Why are the attackers not apologizing and why are the so-called
   apologies written in English and posted on overseas social media,
   instead of in Chinese, if they are really sorry about the two
   mainlanders they attacked and insulted, Shen said.
   The statement only shows their hypocrisy, dishonest and craftiness,
   said Shen, calling them the "stupid generation."
   "If they are really sorry for their behaviors, they should turn
   themselves in to the police and take legal responsibility," said Victor
   Chan, 33, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Young
   Commentators.
   Their damage to travelers, the airport and Hong Kong's international
   image could not be recovered by only a simple apology, said Chan.
   Hong Kong is the victim of the rioters' self-defeating behaviors and
   it's time for the Hong Kong government and police to take actions, in
   addition to pledges, to defend the future of the city, said Shen.
   Analysts noted that the apology could not whitewash the fact that the
   protesters' extremely violent moves at the airport were criminal
   actions, nor should it earn any leniency from judicial authorities as
   the motivation for the apology is being questioned by many.
   Radical protesters are being blamed by other anti-government protesters
   not for injuries to normal people but for their damage to the
   reputation of the so-called peaceful and rational demonstrations.
   Frontline radical protesters are now jeopardizing the overall image of
   Hong Kong protesters due to the escalated violence, some protesters
   posted on LIHKG and Telegram social networks.
   More Hongkongers are unlikely to support them if the violence continues
   spreading, they said.
