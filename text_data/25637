   Worn & Torn – Ross takes us through his trusty collection of NEXX
   X.G100s. He walked (nearly) away from a heavy crash last year whilst
   racing in the DTRA championship and thankfully the Nexx saved “his
   bacon”. Although he’s never been quite as fast since.


   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1tJzZOiD7E?feature=oembed


   Words by Ross Sharp · The Bike Shed



   Working for the Bike Shed might sound great, but there are some
   drawbacks. One of them is the newfound inability to get away with
   wearing standard kit. OK, it shouldn’t matter a jot what you’re wearing
   but for my assault on the Rookie Class of the DTRA British Flattrack
   Championship it mattered to me a lot. I’d already made a massive
   compromise by buying a modern-ish 450 DTX bike rather than the classic
   Norton, Triumph or Bultaco that I’d actually wanted, but you’ve got to
   start somewhere, right?

   I’m not anywhere near cool enough to have been gifted a Ruby Castel but
   I love that spaceman look sported by Dimitri Coste, Hubert Bastie and
   Frank Chatokhine. Those fuckers are so damn cool they can light a
   cigarette just by staring at it.



   Shopkeep had me all excited with the arrival of the X.G100 made by
   Portuguese outfit NEXX. But I was dubious, how could a two hundred quid
   composite helmet actually be any good? It was bound to be rubbish. I
   made grateful noises and took one off his hands to review, chuntering
   to myself that the visor would definitely steam-up and the padding sag
   within a couple of wears.



   Thankfully, in only the third occurrence since 1986 I was proved wrong.
   Very wrong. The X.G100 fits like one of my Arai car racing lids,
   squeezing my cheeks reassuringly and hugging the rest of my noggin in
   firm yet cosseting pads. I’d go as far as to say that this is nearly
   the most comfortable motorcycle helmet I’ve worn, ever.
   There’s loads of room in front of my mouth which is not only important
   for ensuring one’s artisanally twizzled moustache isn’t tickled whilst
   riding but also avoids the aforementioned visit to the dentist. The
   strap is D-ring type and feels premium quality.



   Seeing as this was to be my race lid I thought it best to prepare with
   a proper test, at speed. A trip down to 72 Motorcycles to ride the
   Norton MM offered the perfect opportunity. The weather was OK for early
   April, a fresh temperature and plenty of moisture in the air, ideal for
   discovering if the visor was any good. Despite it not flipping-up, city
   traffic posed no problem, a thumb under the lip is sufficient to create
   an inch gap for ventilation. There was a minor build-up of steam but
   nothing that didn’t clear within seconds.

   A few weeks later during the Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber launch around a damp
   and near freezing Lake Como I tried my best to find fault with the
   visor system but again, it performed perfectly well. The opening might
   seem small but I find peripheral vision to be comparable with most
   modern style lids. The thick chin bar perhaps requires more of a nod to
   see gauges clearly but I don’t do that very often anyway.



   I’ve since tried Anti-Fog and Rain X, a great solution for really damp
   days. When particularly flustered, at a petrol station or trying to
   find my keys, I’ve resorted to tugging at the elasticated straps and
   releasing the popper, allowing the goggles to hang down on the opposite
   side. This can be done whilst riding and clipped back into position
   without too much bother, once you’ve got the knack.

   My Guzzi Stelvio did have a screen but I made sure to test the Nexx at
   motorway speeds in a full breeze. Standing on the pegs and hanging off
   the side I stuck my head into relatively unmolested air to check for
   noise, buffeting and the security of the visor’s poppers. In the name
   of research your honour I may have made sure the NEXX was able to cope
   with velocities at least a 50% more than prescribed limits.

   There was very little lift from the visor and for someone with weapon’s
   grade tinnitus I found the NEXX to be super quiet. My head is a medium
   and there is only one shell size so I presume the extra padding/foam
   dampened wind noise.

   But noise is exactly what I’d expose the X.G100 to a few weeks later at
   the opening round of the DTRA season. I might have entered the Rookie
   Class but I wasn’t about to come unstuck through poor prep. I spoke
   with the good people at Bob Heath Visors, yes, that old school company
   your dad and probably his dad bought eye protection from, they sorted
   me out with tear-offs from a Shoei something or other and the necessary
   fitting kit.

   Before I even rolled up to the start line at Rye House I’d given the
   helmet a wee test. Remember when your mum tells you to come in for tea
   but you have just one more go on the rope swing… and then smash your
   face-in and break your mate’s arm. Well I didn’t heed that internal
   warning at the DTRA practice at Eastbourne Speedway. Most people had
   packed up and called it a day, but I knew best, I’d stay out with the
   big boys and try to keep up. BLAM! A cloud of dust settled and I
   eventually stood up. The NEXX took a hit but wasn’t cracked or
   obviously damaged, just scuffed. Shopkeep wouldn’t be happy. But at
   least it had lasted five hours longer than my previous test lid.



   The good people from NEXX didn’t quite know what they were in for and
   promised a few more helmets. Another one took a bash at the El Rollo
   race during Wheels & Waves but it didn’t seem bad enough to retire it.
   Yes, yes I know, disposable items and all that.

   The following weekend I finished that one off at the DTRA Round 3.
   Shopkeep less than politely told me to vacate his emporium, I had to
   speak to NEXX directly and ask for another. Thankfully the thought of
   spending more time in A&E kept me out of danger and I made it to the
   end of the season on the last remaining X.G100.



   To say the season went well is a bit of an understatement, even in my
   wildest dreams and I’ve got some imagination. To celebrate winning the
   championship I headed to an open race with the big boys and pros, back
   at my bogey track, Greenfields. I wasn’t in the zone and should have
   parked up to enjoy a beer instead, but being a Rookie I didn’t listen
   to that voice, again. Turn 1 I hit another rider and did my finest
   Superman impression, flying across the track and landing forehead first
   in the compacted dirt. Out cold for long enough to have everyone
   worried and to nearly get a go in a helicopter, I lay there limp.



   After a yet another trip to A&E, CAT scans, X-rays and a telling off
   from the doctor I spent the next few weeks with my tail between my legs
   but counting my lucky stars. To say that it could have been worse is a
   massive understatement. I have absolutely no doubt that if I’d been
   sporting an overly trendy lid or anything with less protection I’d be
   unable to string these sentences together.

   To put it bluntly, the NEXX saved my bacon. If you don’t believe me pop
   into Bike Shed in Shoreditch and ask Shopkeep if you can see the
   battered helmet. Although split, scuffed and cracked the integrity of
   the shell remained intact and the shock absorbing foam did its job.



   If you want to look cool without blowing the budget, I reckon there’s
   not a lot that beats the X.G100. And there are new colour ways for
   2017, including carbon. If safety is at the top of your tree, you
   needn’t look much further.

   Worn & Torn – Ross takes us through his trusty collection of NEXX
   X.G100s. He walked (nearly) away from a heavy crash last year whilst
   racing in the DTRA championship and thankfully the Nexx saved “his
   bacon”. Although he’s never been quite as fast since.

   Words by Ross Sharp · The Bike Shed



   Working for the Bike Shed might sound great, but there are some
   drawbacks. One of them is the newfound inability to get away with
   wearing standard kit. OK, it shouldn’t matter a jot what you’re wearing
   but for my assault on the Rookie Class of the DTRA British Flattrack
   Championship it mattered to me a lot. I’d already made a massive
   compromise by buying a modern-ish 450 DTX bike rather than the classic
   Norton, Triumph or Bultaco that I’d actually wanted, but you’ve got to
   start somewhere, right?

   I’m not anywhere near cool enough to have been gifted a Ruby Castel but
   I love that spaceman look sported by Dimitri Coste, Hubert Bastie and
   Frank Chatokhine. Those fuckers are so damn cool they can light a
   cigarette just by staring at it.



   Shopkeep had me all excited with the arrival of the X.G100 made by
   Portuguese outfit NEXX. But I was dubious, how could a two hundred quid
   composite helmet actually be any good? It was bound to be rubbish. I
   made grateful noises and took one off his hands to review, chuntering
   to myself that the visor would definitely steam-up and the padding sag
   within a couple of wears.



   Thankfully, in only the third occurrence since 1986 I was proved wrong.
   Very wrong. The X.G100 fits like one of my Arai car racing lids,
   squeezing my cheeks reassuringly and hugging the rest of my noggin in
   firm yet cosseting pads. I’d go as far as to say that this is nearly
   the most comfortable motorcycle helmet I’ve worn, ever.
   There’s loads of room in front of my mouth which is not only important
   for ensuring one’s artisanally twizzled moustache isn’t tickled whilst
   riding but also avoids the aforementioned visit to the dentist. The
   strap is D-ring type and feels premium quality.



   Seeing as this was to be my race lid I thought it best to prepare with
   a proper test, at speed. A trip down to 72 Motorcycles to ride the
   Norton MM offered the perfect opportunity. The weather was OK for early
   April, a fresh temperature and plenty of moisture in the air, ideal for
   discovering if the visor was any good. Despite it not flipping-up, city
   traffic posed no problem, a thumb under the lip is sufficient to create
   an inch gap for ventilation. There was a minor build-up of steam but
   nothing that didn’t clear within seconds.

   A few weeks later during the Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber launch around a damp
   and near freezing Lake Como I tried my best to find fault with the
   visor system but again, it performed perfectly well. The opening might
   seem small but I find peripheral vision to be comparable with most
   modern style lids. The thick chin bar perhaps requires more of a nod to
   see gauges clearly but I don’t do that very often anyway.



   I’ve since tried Anti-Fog and Rain X, a great solution for really damp
   days. When particularly flustered, at a petrol station or trying to
   find my keys, I’ve resorted to tugging at the elasticated straps and
   releasing the popper, allowing the goggles to hang down on the opposite
   side. This can be done whilst riding and clipped back into position
   without too much bother, once you’ve got the knack.

   My Guzzi Stelvio did have a screen but I made sure to test the Nexx at
   motorway speeds in a full breeze. Standing on the pegs and hanging off
   the side I stuck my head into relatively unmolested air to check for
   noise, buffeting and the security of the visor’s poppers. In the name
   of research your honour I may have made sure the NEXX was able to cope
   with velocities at least a 50% more than prescribed limits.

   There was very little lift from the visor and for someone with weapon’s
   grade tinnitus I found the NEXX to be super quiet. My head is a medium
   and there is only one shell size so I presume the extra padding/foam
   dampened wind noise.

   But noise is exactly what I’d expose the X.G100 to a few weeks later at
   the opening round of the DTRA season. I might have entered the Rookie
   Class but I wasn’t about to come unstuck through poor prep. I spoke
   with the good people at Bob Heath Visors, yes, that old school company
   your dad and probably his dad bought eye protection from, they sorted
   me out with tear-offs from a Shoei something or other and the necessary
   fitting kit.

   Before I even rolled up to the start line at Rye House I’d given the
   helmet a wee test. Remember when your mum tells you to come in for tea
   but you have just one more go on the rope swing… and then smash your
   face-in and break your mate’s arm. Well I didn’t heed that internal
   warning at the DTRA practice at Eastbourne Speedway. Most people had
   packed up and called it a day, but I knew best, I’d stay out with the
   big boys and try to keep up. BLAM! A cloud of dust settled and I
   eventually stood up. The NEXX took a hit but wasn’t cracked or
   obviously damaged, just scuffed. Shopkeep wouldn’t be happy. But at
   least it had lasted five hours longer than my previous test lid.



   The good people from NEXX didn’t quite know what they were in for and
   promised a few more helmets. Another one took a bash at the El Rollo
   race during Wheels & Waves but it didn’t seem bad enough to retire it.
   Yes, yes I know, disposable items and all that.

   The following weekend I finished that one off at the DTRA Round 3.
   Shopkeep less than politely told me to vacate his emporium, I had to
   speak to NEXX directly and ask for another. Thankfully the thought of
   spending more time in A&E kept me out of danger and I made it to the
   end of the season on the last remaining X.G100.



   To say the season went well is a bit of an understatement, even in my
   wildest dreams and I’ve got some imagination. To celebrate winning the
   championship I headed to an open race with the big boys and pros, back
   at my bogey track, Greenfields. I wasn’t in the zone and should have
   parked up to enjoy a beer instead, but being a Rookie I didn’t listen
   to that voice, again. Turn 1 I hit another rider and did my finest
   Superman impression, flying across the track and landing forehead first
   in the compacted dirt. Out cold for long enough to have everyone
   worried and to nearly get a go in a helicopter, I lay there limp.



   After a yet another trip to A&E, CAT scans, X-rays and a telling off
   from the doctor I spent the next few weeks with my tail between my legs
   but counting my lucky stars. To say that it could have been worse is a
   massive understatement. I have absolutely no doubt that if I’d been
   sporting an overly trendy lid or anything with less protection I’d be
   unable to string these sentences together.

   To put it bluntly, the NEXX saved my bacon. If you don’t believe me pop
   into Bike Shed in Shoreditch and ask Shopkeep if you can see the
   battered helmet. Although split, scuffed and cracked the integrity of
   the shell remained intact and the shock absorbing foam did its job.



   If you want to look cool without blowing the budget, I reckon there’s
   not a lot that beats the X.G100. And there are new colour ways for
   2017, including carbon. If safety is at the top of your tree, you
   needn’t look much further.

   It has come to our attention that there are a number of online stores
   selling counterfeit NEXX Helmets. These products are announced using
   original NEXX Helmets product photos but often are offered at an
   improbably low price and/or with significant discounts. Please be
   suspicious about very low prices as they can be reminiscent of possible
   counterfeit fraud.

   Before purchasing your NEXX Helmet online, please be sure to confirm if
   the retailer of your choice is cataloged on our list of authorized
   dealers by using our store locator:
   https://www.nexx-helmets.com/en/store-locator/

   If in doubt, please contact us via our Social Media channels or email
   support@nexxpro.com for more information.
   NEXX Helmets prides on delivering genuine premium quality helmets that
   result from a combination of hard work, dedication, and passion with
   state-of-the-art and high-tech components that guarantee uncompromised
   safety and quality.

   The craftsmanship of NEXX Helmets is never paralleled in non-authentic
   products. Besides using high-quality materials, a helmet designed by
   NEXX is immediately recognizable with is differentiable, unmistakable
   and unique design.

   You can be confident that your helmet is the real deal if it was
   purchased from an authorized NEXX Helmets dealer.
   However, here are a few telltale signs you can look for whilst shopping
   online to distinguish an authentic e-commerce website from a fake.

   • If the price is much lower than you’ve seen in other e-commerce
   websites. Meaning, when it is too good to be true then it is probably
   isn’t. Do not buy the product.

   • Do they have a safe, secure payment system? Please avoid any
   retailers (or marketplaces retailers) requesting payment via money
   order, a wire transfer, bitcoins, or even a random gift card.

   • Is the retailer asking for unnecessary personal information? Name,
   shipping and/ or billing address and e-mail information are common
   requests to complete your order but please be aware of retailers asking
   for sensitive information such as your social media account logins or
   other confidential information.

   Nonetheless, before placing an order online, we strongly encourage you
   to research online for reviews of that website and to make an educated
   purchase.

   NEXX Helmets is a registered trademark. The use of the NEXX Helmets
   trademark without permission is considered counterfeiting and warrants
   legal action. The sale and distribution of counterfeit product is a
   crime under many international laws and is punishable through legal
   action. Please keep in mind that most often the manufacturers of a
   counterfeit product do not pay taxes, do not pay fair wages or benefits
   to their employees and frequently utilize illegal labor.

   NEXX Helmets cannot, by any circumstances, be held responsible or
   accountable for any physical or online purchase of a counterfeit item,
   anywhere in the world.

   We encourage all consumers to combat counterfeits by reporting your
   suspicions to support@nexxpro.com or using our social media channels.

   Worn & Torn – Ross takes us through his trusty collection of NEXX
   X.G100s. He walked (nearly) away from a heavy crash last year whilst
   racing in the DTRA championship and thankfully the Nexx saved “his
   bacon”. Although he’s never been quite as fast since.


   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1tJzZOiD7E?feature=oembed


   Words by Ross Sharp · The Bike Shed



   Working for the Bike Shed might sound great, but there are some
   drawbacks. One of them is the newfound inability to get away with
   wearing standard kit. OK, it shouldn’t matter a jot what you’re wearing
   but for my assault on the Rookie Class of the DTRA British Flattrack
   Championship it mattered to me a lot. I’d already made a massive
   compromise by buying a modern-ish 450 DTX bike rather than the classic
   Norton, Triumph or Bultaco that I’d actually wanted, but you’ve got to
   start somewhere, right?

   I’m not anywhere near cool enough to have been gifted a Ruby Castel but
   I love that spaceman look sported by Dimitri Coste, Hubert Bastie and
   Frank Chatokhine. Those fuckers are so damn cool they can light a
   cigarette just by staring at it.



   Shopkeep had me all excited with the arrival of the X.G100 made by
   Portuguese outfit NEXX. But I was dubious, how could a two hundred quid
   composite helmet actually be any good? It was bound to be rubbish. I
   made grateful noises and took one off his hands to review, chuntering
   to myself that the visor would definitely steam-up and the padding sag
   within a couple of wears.



   Thankfully, in only the third occurrence since 1986 I was proved wrong.
   Very wrong. The X.G100 fits like one of my Arai car racing lids,
   squeezing my cheeks reassuringly and hugging the rest of my noggin in
   firm yet cosseting pads. I’d go as far as to say that this is nearly
   the most comfortable motorcycle helmet I’ve worn, ever.
   There’s loads of room in front of my mouth which is not only important
   for ensuring one’s artisanally twizzled moustache isn’t tickled whilst
   riding but also avoids the aforementioned visit to the dentist. The
   strap is D-ring type and feels premium quality.



   Seeing as this was to be my race lid I thought it best to prepare with
   a proper test, at speed. A trip down to 72 Motorcycles to ride the
   Norton MM offered the perfect opportunity. The weather was OK for early
   April, a fresh temperature and plenty of moisture in the air, ideal for
   discovering if the visor was any good. Despite it not flipping-up, city
   traffic posed no problem, a thumb under the lip is sufficient to create
   an inch gap for ventilation. There was a minor build-up of steam but
   nothing that didn’t clear within seconds.

   A few weeks later during the Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber launch around a damp
   and near freezing Lake Como I tried my best to find fault with the
   visor system but again, it performed perfectly well. The opening might
   seem small but I find peripheral vision to be comparable with most
   modern style lids. The thick chin bar perhaps requires more of a nod to
   see gauges clearly but I don’t do that very often anyway.



   I’ve since tried Anti-Fog and Rain X, a great solution for really damp
   days. When particularly flustered, at a petrol station or trying to
   find my keys, I’ve resorted to tugging at the elasticated straps and
   releasing the popper, allowing the goggles to hang down on the opposite
   side. This can be done whilst riding and clipped back into position
   without too much bother, once you’ve got the knack.

   My Guzzi Stelvio did have a screen but I made sure to test the Nexx at
   motorway speeds in a full breeze. Standing on the pegs and hanging off
   the side I stuck my head into relatively unmolested air to check for
   noise, buffeting and the security of the visor’s poppers. In the name
   of research your honour I may have made sure the NEXX was able to cope
   with velocities at least a 50% more than prescribed limits.

   There was very little lift from the visor and for someone with weapon’s
   grade tinnitus I found the NEXX to be super quiet. My head is a medium
   and there is only one shell size so I presume the extra padding/foam
   dampened wind noise.

   But noise is exactly what I’d expose the X.G100 to a few weeks later at
   the opening round of the DTRA season. I might have entered the Rookie
   Class but I wasn’t about to come unstuck through poor prep. I spoke
   with the good people at Bob Heath Visors, yes, that old school company
   your dad and probably his dad bought eye protection from, they sorted
   me out with tear-offs from a Shoei something or other and the necessary
   fitting kit.

   Before I even rolled up to the start line at Rye House I’d given the
   helmet a wee test. Remember when your mum tells you to come in for tea
   but you have just one more go on the rope swing… and then smash your
   face-in and break your mate’s arm. Well I didn’t heed that internal
   warning at the DTRA practice at Eastbourne Speedway. Most people had
   packed up and called it a day, but I knew best, I’d stay out with the
   big boys and try to keep up. BLAM! A cloud of dust settled and I
   eventually stood up. The NEXX took a hit but wasn’t cracked or
   obviously damaged, just scuffed. Shopkeep wouldn’t be happy. But at
   least it had lasted five hours longer than my previous test lid.



   The good people from NEXX didn’t quite know what they were in for and
   promised a few more helmets. Another one took a bash at the El Rollo
   race during Wheels & Waves but it didn’t seem bad enough to retire it.
   Yes, yes I know, disposable items and all that.

   The following weekend I finished that one off at the DTRA Round 3.
   Shopkeep less than politely told me to vacate his emporium, I had to
   speak to NEXX directly and ask for another. Thankfully the thought of
   spending more time in A&E kept me out of danger and I made it to the
   end of the season on the last remaining X.G100.



   To say the season went well is a bit of an understatement, even in my
   wildest dreams and I’ve got some imagination. To celebrate winning the
   championship I headed to an open race with the big boys and pros, back
   at my bogey track, Greenfields. I wasn’t in the zone and should have
   parked up to enjoy a beer instead, but being a Rookie I didn’t listen
   to that voice, again. Turn 1 I hit another rider and did my finest
   Superman impression, flying across the track and landing forehead first
   in the compacted dirt. Out cold for long enough to have everyone
   worried and to nearly get a go in a helicopter, I lay there limp.



   After a yet another trip to A&E, CAT scans, X-rays and a telling off
   from the doctor I spent the next few weeks with my tail between my legs
   but counting my lucky stars. To say that it could have been worse is a
   massive understatement. I have absolutely no doubt that if I’d been
   sporting an overly trendy lid or anything with less protection I’d be
   unable to string these sentences together.

   To put it bluntly, the NEXX saved my bacon. If you don’t believe me pop
   into Bike Shed in Shoreditch and ask Shopkeep if you can see the
   battered helmet. Although split, scuffed and cracked the integrity of
   the shell remained intact and the shock absorbing foam did its job.



   If you want to look cool without blowing the budget, I reckon there’s
   not a lot that beats the X.G100. And there are new colour ways for
   2017, including carbon. If safety is at the top of your tree, you
   needn’t look much further.
