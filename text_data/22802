What Makes Miro So Amazing?

   Device Makers, Music Stores, Cloud Services why you need Miro and how
   to partner with us
   [current-full.jpg]

Works with your current music library

   It's very easy to switch from iTunes to Miro -- without any copying.
   Just point Miro to your music and video folders and those files will
   appear. If you don't like Miro (impossible!), nothing's changed.

Converts and syncs to Android & Kindle Fire

   You'd have to be crazy to use a music player that doesn't sync to your
   phone. Miro is simply the best music and video player for Android
   phones and tablets.

Download and play almost any video

   Do you still use separate programs to download, play music, play
   videos, and sync to your phone? Miro plays almost any video or music
   format and downloads from YouTube, podcasts, Amazon, and bittorrent.

Share Your Media on your Network

   When two Miro's are on the same wifi network, they can stream and
   transfer music and videos to each other. It's the easiest way to watch
   a video or play music upstairs if the file is downstairs.

Open-source - don't lock yourself in!

   Unlike some other media players (cough, cough), Miro is not trying to
   run your life! Not only is Miro 100% free and open-source, it's made by
   a non-profit organization. You don't need to be locked down by one
   corporation to have a great media experience.

   organize, and watch videos and listen to music. And it's totally free.
