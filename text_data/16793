   The staff is very rude, especialy the lady with red hair, maybe she

   ok, but everything is ruined by the staff.

   Nove Mesto (New Town)
   Nearly 700 hundred metres long, Wenceslas Square
   represents the most frequent and buzzing crossroads of
   the city. The National Museum in the upper part of the
   square watches over your spending spree in countless
   shops and retail stores lining the entire square,
   which ends at Na Příkopě, the most famous shopping
   street. When tired or broke, you can explore the
   city's underpasses, which can take you to the Old Town
   ...More
   or to the courtyards of art nouveau houses with secret
   gems of greenery, white benches and rose bushes that
   provide unexpected peace in the midst of the city. Be
   sure to pay a visit to the traditional cafés, classic
   Czech pubs, cinemas and theatres. National Theatre
   near the river has a lot to offer to foreigners. Go to
   the river bank and enjoy live music and drinks while
   watching a sunset behind Prague Castle.

   Best vegan cake

   Was looking for a vegan cake place on Sunday afternoon. We ordered a

   Would you please elaborate on this through our email
   info@cafebaribal.cz? Because I was there that night. Nobody from your
   friends said a word about bad attitude and at the end you even said
   "thank you and goodbye" to the bartenders. Thank you.
