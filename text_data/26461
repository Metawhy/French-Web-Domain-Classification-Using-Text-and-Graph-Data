Visit us for an incredible opportunity to view and enjoy wildlife from around
the world

   Since 1983, Jungle Cat World Wildlife Park has been offering visitors
   the unique opportunity to see and experience wild species, many
   threatened with extinction, in an up-close and personal environment.
   Professional staff are readily available and always eager to share
   their knowledge and enthusiasm. Welcome!
     __________________________________________________________________

Our Mission

   We at Jungle Cat World Wildlife Park believe that all living creatures
   are significant and must be treated with value and respect. Our
   passion, purpose and why we exist, is to provide hope and solutions to
   ensure the survival of wildlife and endangered species for future
   generations. This has been our life's work since 1983.

Work at the Zoo

   Each summer, children, teens and adults from around the world take part
   in the Safari Zoo Camp experience. We offer participants the unique
   privilege to learn about nature through hands-on experiences, helping
   develop awareness and concern for endangered wildlife and habitats.
   This fun and interactive approach to environmental education encourages
   campers to build the necessary confidence, knowledge and skills to live
   in harmony with nature.

Meet the Animals

   Our purpose is to connect our guests with the animals in our care in a
   mutually respectful and meaningful way.

   Safe and controlled up-close experiences and interactions with wildlife
   have a profound and lasting impact, a visceral experience that begins
   with awe and ends with compassion. To encourage environmentally
   positive behavioural change, we need you to feel personally invested-
   you need to genuinely care.
