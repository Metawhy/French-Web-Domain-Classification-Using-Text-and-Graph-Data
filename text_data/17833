Blackberry Vanilla Cupcakes

   [Blackberry+Vanilla+Cupcake+final.jpg]

   Growing up, I lived next to a wooded vacant lot.
   Wild blackberry bushes grew there and I would pick blackberries with my
   brothers.
   Sometimes we had so many that my mom would make cobbler or jam with
   them.
   When I spied some fresh blackberries in the store recently,
   it brought back all those great memories and I decided to make a new
   recipe.
   Blackberry Vanilla Cupcakes!
   [Blackberry+Vanilla+Cupcakes+final.jpg]
   You make seedless blackberry puree by processing the berries in your
   blender,
   then straining the puree through a fine mesh sieve.
   The puree makes the cake batter a very deep blue color,
   while the buttercream frosting becomes a beautiful pinkish purple.
   Keep this in mind if you like natural food coloring alternatives!

St. Patrick's Day Green Petal Cake

   [St.+Patrick%2527s+Day+Green+Petal+Cake+final.jpg]

   Here is a lovely Green Petal Cake to help you get ready for St.
   Patrick's Day!
   The petal cake decorating technique is easy to do and so very pretty.
   You can find my step-by-step petal tutorial here.
   My Key Lime Cake recipe was perfect for this green cake...AND it's so
   delicious!
   I used gel food coloring to make the frosting a very pale shade of
   green,
   which I used between the layers and for the crumb coat.
   Next, I divided the remaining frosting into three bowls
   and colored two of them darker shades of green.
   I alternated these colors from darkest to lightest while decorating the
   cake.
   [St.+Patrick%2527s+Day+Green+Petal+Cake+2+final.jpg]
   For the top of the cake, I created a flower shape.
   This is done by making the petals in overlapping concentric circles,
   pulling your dots of frosting toward the center of the cake.
   You can also make simple circles on top, which I did on my Rainbow
   Petal Cake.
   [St.+Patrick%2527s+Day+Green+Petal+Cake+3+final.jpg]
   Happy Saint Patrick's Day!

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax Cupcakes

   [Lorax+Cupcake+Title+final.jpg]

   Do you have March 2nd marked on your calendar?
   It's almost time to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Seuss,
   the beloved author of wonderful, wacky children's books.
   I have made Green Eggs & Ham Cupcakes for his birthday,
    because my children adore that book and have it memorized.
   This year, I decided to make an edible version of one of my favorite
   Seuss characters...
   The Lorax Cupcakes!
   He speaks for the trees, you know.
   [Lorax+Cupcakes+final.jpg]
   What You Will Need:
   A batch of cupcakes
   Orange frosting
   Yellow candy melts
   Piping bag fitted with small round tip (Wilton #3)
   Candy eyes
   Orange Sixlets, M&M's or Skittles

   To download my Lorax mustache template below, click on the image to
   open it.
   Then right click on the image and select "Save Image As".
   Print the template and tape it to the back of a cookie sheet.
   Tape a piece of wax paper on top of the template.
   [Lorax+Mustache+printable.jpg]
   Next, melt the yellow candy melts according to package directions.
   Fill a piping bag with the candy melts.
     Trace over the eyebrow and mustache outlines, piping lines to look
   like hair.
   When they have hardened, carefully peel them off the wax paper.
   [Making+Lorax+mustaches+fix.jpg]
   Arrange the eyebrows, candy eyes and mustache on a frosted cupcake.
   Put a dot of frosting on the back of your orange candy and make a nose.
   [Lorax+Cupcakes+2+final.jpg]
   Enjoy!
   “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,
   Nothing is going to get better. It's not.”

   You can imagine my distress at this revelation.
   We may have to go to therapy to get past it.

   [Making+Hidden+Heart+Cupcakes+2+final.jpg]
   Fill the heart cavity with cream cheese frosting.
   (You can fill a ziploc bag with frosting and snip off the corner.)
   [Making+Hidden+Heart+Cupcakes+3+final.jpg]

Black Forest Cake with Chocolate Ganache

     [Black+Forest+Cake+Title+final.jpg]
   Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte!
   That's what this Black Forest Cake is called in Germany, where the
   recipe originated.
   It is a delightful combination of chocolate, cherries and whipped
   cream.
   For my version, I added cherry extract to my favorite chocolate cake
   recipe.
   Then I layered it with fresh whipped cream and cherry pie filling,
   and topped it all with thick chocolate ganache.
   Scrumptious!
   Isn't it simply gorgeous?
   Is it fair for a cake to be so pretty AND taste so good?

   Black Forest Cake with Chocolate Ganache
   by Bird On A Cake
   6058473
   Ingredients
   Chocolate Cherry Cake
     * 1 cup boiling water
     * 2 cups granulated sugar
     * 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
     * 3/4 cup cocoa powder
     * 2 teaspoons baking soda
     * 1 teaspoon baking powder
     * 1 teaspoon salt
     * 2 eggs
     * 1 cup buttermilk (OR 1 tablespoon vinegar mixed with 1 cup milk)
     * 1/2 cup vegetable oil
     * 1 teaspoon cherry extract

   Chocolate Ganache
     * 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
     * 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
     * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

   Whipped Cream
     * 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
     * 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
     * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

     * 1 (21 oz.) can cherry pie filling

   Instructions
   Chocolate Cherry Cake
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottoms of two 9 inch round cake
   pans with wax paper and grease the sides. Bring a small pan of water to
   a boil and keep it simmering while you mix the other ingredients.
   In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking
   soda, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil and cherry
   extract. Beat with mixer until combined.
   Add 1 cup of the boiling water and carefully stir until it is mixed in.
   Beat for 1 1/2 minutes with mixer. Batter will be thin. Pour the batter
   into prepared pans and bake for 20-24 minutes (until toothpick inserted
   in center comes out clean).
   Chocolate Ganache
   Place the chocolate chips in a small metal bowl. Heat the cream over
   medium heat. Watch it closely and immediately remove from heat when it
   starts to boil. Pour over chocolate chips. Wait for 2 minutes, then
   slowly stir the mixture until all the chips have completely melted and
   it is thoroughly combined. Stir in the vanilla. Let the ganache cool
   until it reaches a thicker, spreadable consistency.
   Whipped Cream
   Chill a large mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer for 10 minutes.
   Pour heavy cream into the bowl and whip until peaks are just about to
   form. Add vanilla and sugar; beat until stiff peaks form. Make sure not
   to over-beat, cream will then become lumpy and butter-like.
   Assembling Your Cake
   Level cake layers and place one layer on a cake plate. Spread 3/4 of
   the whipped cream on the cake layer, leaving one inch of space around
   the edge. Reserve 12 cherries and set aside; drop the remaining pie
   filling by spoonfuls on top of the whipped cream. Place second cake
   layer on top. Spread thickened ganache on top of the cake, just to the
   edges. Garnish with remaining whipped cream and reserved cherries.
