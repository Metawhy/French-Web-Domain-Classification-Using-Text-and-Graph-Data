Presentation

                              Charles Grellois

   Welcome to my teaching and research page !

   I am a Maître de Conférences at Université Aix-Marseille. I teach
   Computer Science at the Faculté d'Economie et de Gestion and I do
   research in the LIRICA team of the LIS laboratory.

   I used to be a PhD student at IRIF (ex-PPS & LIAFA labs, University
   Paris 7), then a research assistant in Dundee, and then a postdoctoral
   researcher in the FOCUS team, in Bologna.
