   The QUAERO French Medical Corpus

Introduction

   The QUAERO French Medical Corpus has been initially developed as a
   resource for named entity recognition and normalization [1]. It was
   then improved with the purpose of creating a gold standard set of
   normalized entities for French biomedical text, that was used in the
   CLEF eHealth evaluation lab [2][3].
   A selection of MEDLINE titles and EMEA documents were manually
   annotated. The annotation process was guided by concepts in the Unified
   Medical Language System (UMLS):
   1. Ten types of clinical entities, as defined by the following UMLS
   Semantic Groups (Bodenreider and McCray 2003) were annotated: Anatomy,
   Chemical and Drugs, Devices, Disorders, Geographic Areas, Living
   Beings, Objects, Phenomena, Physiology, Procedures.
   2. The annotations were made in a comprehensive fashion, so that nested
   entities were marked, and entities could be mapped to more than one
   UMLS concept. In particular: (a) If a mention can refer to more than
   one Semantic Group, all the relevant Semantic Groups should be
   annotated. For instance, the mention “récidive” (recurrence) in the
   phrase “prévention des récidives” (recurrence prevention) should be
   annotated with the category “DISORDER” (CUI C2825055) and the category
   “PHENOMENON” (CUI C0034897); (b) If a mention can refer to more than
   one UMLS concept within the same Semantic Group, all the relevant
   concepts should be annotated. For instance, the mention “maniaques”
   (obsessive) in the phrase “patients maniaques” (obsessive patients)
   should be annotated with CUIs C0564408 and C0338831 (category
   “DISORDER”); (c) Entities which span overlaps with that of another
   entity should still be annotated. For instance, in the phrase
   “infarctus du myocarde” (myocardial infarction), the mention “myocarde”
   (myocardium) should be annotated with category “ANATOMY” (CUI C0027061)
   and the mention “infarctus du myocarde” should be annotated with
   category “DISORDER” (CUI C0027051)

   We provide below examples of the annotations that can be found in the
   QUAERO French Medical corpus.

   The scientific article titles used in this corpus were obtained from
   the US National Library of Medicine (NLM)'s MEDLINE™ database in 2013.
   Subsequently, titles were annotated. There were no updates of the
   titles since 2013 so that the titles in the corpus may differ from
   those found in more recent versions of MEDLINE.

   Any research using this corpus for running experiments should include
   the following citation:

   Annotations are available in the BRAT Rapid Annotation Tool (BRAT)
   standoff format, described here: http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html,
   which can be loaded into BRAT for vizualization.

   Annotations have also been automatically converted to the BioC format
   using the Brat2BioC conversion software.

   Sample annotations (in BRAT format) are shown below.
