   OUR MISSION STATEMENT

   Miami Design Preservation League is a not-for-profit preservation and
   arts organization founded in 1976, which preserves, protects and
   promotes the architectural, cultural, social and environmental
   integrity of Miami Beach and the surrounding areas.

   Originally organized by Barbara Baer Capitman and friends in 1976, it
   is the oldest Art Deco Society in the World.

   MDPL provides cultural and educational programs to Miami-Dade County
   residents, surrounding counties, citizens of Florida and to national
   and international visitors and tourists. Our programs are developed for
   the general public and have special appeal to those interested in art,
   design, architecture, history, preservation, urban and community
   planning and development.

   The Miami Design Preservation League welcomes donations of personal
   papers, photographs and art, relating to the City of Miami Beach’s
   architectural history. We are also looking for any memorabilia
   pertaining to any hotels, restaurants, or business and their history.
