Neural Machine Translation Solutions for Secure Communication & Global
Collaboration

Understand information, in real-time

   "I received an email today and I couldn‚Äôt read the Japanese. I want to
   instantly translate the email without leaving the app. I need to
   instant message my colleague in my native language during my flight."
   Highly trained professionals are experiencing this moment daily. They
   don‚Äôt understand or never receive translations for important
   information. Pressured to understand the information immediately, they
   resolve to use public wifi and free online translation tools, placing
   private customer information, financial data and intellectual property
   at risk.
   Add to this 60,000 employees, giant knowledge bases, regulations,
   security protocols and 24 languages -- and you‚Äôre dealing with very
   complex problems.

Complexity

   We live at the heart of big data, multiple languages, globally
   dispersed teams, high security standards and bold visions.
     * Work instructions for global manufacturing teams
     * Warranty feedback for early detection of product recall
     * Compliance education updates caused by new regulations that need to
       be read in the local language
     * Colloquial slang needed to be understood to build better rapport
     * ...

   This is where we excel.

   Security

Security

   Trusted by the intelligence community, Fortune 10 and disruptive
   startups.

   50 years ago during the Cold War, we set out to translate terabytes of
   Russian-to-English data for the Air Force. Today, our tech is deployed
   by captains of industry to eliminate barriers across language, device,
   channel and border.

Productivity

   Your team can lose weeks, waiting for information to be translated. Or,
   they might place sensitive information online in free, public
   web-translation sites (Shadow IT).

   Give your team the ability to securely translate documents, emails and
   instant messages into their native language offline, on their device or
   securely behind your firewall.
   Productivity
   Accuracy

Accuracy

   Best-in-class machine translation technology.

   With our proprietary new neural machine translation engine, PNMT‚Ñ¢,
   machine translation is more accurate than ever before. Get
   domain-specific translations based on in-house content and
   dictionaries.
