   Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Starbucks Corp. scored legal victories
   against European Union regulators Tuesday, in court rulings that
   restrict the reach of the bloc’s privacy orders and deal a blow to its

   The European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn’t generally have
   to apply the EU’s “right to be forgotten” to versions of its search
