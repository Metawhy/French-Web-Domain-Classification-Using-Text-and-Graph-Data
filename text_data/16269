   VS @code does so many things right. I‚Äôm constantly impressed by the UX,
   and customizing workspace / user preferences is no exception. üôåüèºüíØ It
   just keeps getting better ‚ù§Ô∏è
   Jonathan Dunlap @jadbox
   Awesome - VS Code will have deep remote development: you can connect to
   a container running a different OS and be able to use any VS Code
   plugins/linting/debugging for that environment. üî•üî•üî•
   Pavithra Kodmad @PKodmad
   VS Code is my most used and favorite editor. I love being able to
   customize the editor - changing the layout, the icons, fonts and color
   scheme is so easy!
   Darren @MrDarrenV
   Just as I thought @code couldn't get better, out comes its Remote
   Development plugins in the Stable version that let you remote into
   containers as a dev environment! üòç
   Cassidy Williams @cassidoo
   I was a vim fan, but then discovered VS Code's Vim plugin, which lets
   me add in my vim keybindings. I can maintain my coding style without
   having to compromise on speed.
   Gift Egwuenu @lauragift21
   I love @code, the built-in markdown previewer is awesome and the plugin
   system allows me to use GitLens, which makes my workflow so much
   easier.

   Intellisense

Meet IntelliSense.

   Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which
   provides smart completions based on variable types, function
   definitions, and imported modules.
   Debugging

Print statement debugging is a thing of the past.

   Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps
   and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.
   Git

Git commands built-in.

   Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review
   diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and
   pull from any hosted SCM service.
   Easily use extensions in VS Code

Extensible and customizable.

   Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages,
   themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions
   run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor.
   Learn more about extensions.
   Git

Deploy with confidence and ease

   With Microsoft Azure you can deploy and host your React, Angular, Vue,
   Node, Python (and more!) sites, store and query relational and document
   based data, and scale with serverless computing, all with ease, all
   from within VS Code.
