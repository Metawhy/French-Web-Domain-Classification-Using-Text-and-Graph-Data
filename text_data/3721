Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy sets out how and why GS1 AISBL (“GS1”) collects, stores,
and processes your personal data when you use its websites and services - as
well as your rights with respect to your personal data.  If you have any
questions or feedback, please contact privacy@gs1.org.


1. The Controller

   The Controller that is responsible for collecting and processing your
   personal data when you use the Websites is:
   GS1 AISBL
   Blue Tower, Avenue Louise 326, b. 10
   1050 Brussels
   Belgium
   Email:  privacy@gs1.org
   Website:  www.gs1.org

2. Definitions

   “Controller” means GS1 AISBL, also referred to as “we”, “us”, and
   “our”.

   “processor” means a natural or legal person that processes personal
   data on behalf of or pursuant to GS1’s instructions.

   “processing” refers to the ways your personal data is (among other
   things) collected, stored, used, disclosed, and erased.

   “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or
   identifiable natural person (a “Data Subject”).  Examples of such
   personal data includes your name, email address, photograph,
   professional title, business phone number, and any other personal
   information you provide to us that is capable of identifying you.

   “services” includes GS1 services such as the GS1 MO Zone, GS1 Cloud,
   GS1 Activate, GS1 Learning Zone, GS1 Xchange, GEPIR Premium, and other
   GS1 services that are created and made available from time to time.

   “Website(s)” include https://www.gs1.org/, http://mozone.gs1.org/,
   https://gs1.wufoo.eu/, https://gs1sso.gs1.org/Account/Login for
   services, as well as the GS1 events webpages as created from time to
   time.

3. Collecting Personal Data

   The GS1 Websites, including the services available on them, collect
   personal data that enables us to provide secure Website access and our
   services to you.  When you interact with the Websites (i.e. to register
   your details and/or login), your personal data is collected for
   registration and security purposes.  Personal data is collected as
   input by you and from third party processing services that collect
   personal data via our Websites (such as event registrations).
   Personal Data is only collected when necessary to provide secure
   Website access and/or services to you, and is limited to the relevant
   types of personal data actually required.

4. Purposes of Processing & Legal Basis

   Website Use
   The personal data GS1 collects via its Websites allow us to provide
   secure access to our Websites and to respond to your questions.
   This type of processing is done with your consent, which you may give
   when submitting your details via the electronic contact form, and
   otherwise for GS1’s legitimate interest of improving the Websites, our
   services and responding to your queries.

   Registration
   Our Websites, and the services they provide, may require users to
   register their personal data (for example name, email address, and
   password) and user consent is requested at the time of registration.
   This type of processing is done on the legal basis of your consent and
   otherwise, where consent is not legally required, for GS1’s legitimate
   interest of ensuring the security of our services and the people that
   access and use them.  Where a user has entered into a contract with GS1
   (for example that relates to a service), then it may be necessary for
   us to process personal data in order to fulfil our obligations to
   perform the contract.

   Marketing & Organisation Communication
   Personal data may be processed for the purpose of sending email
   communications about GS1 news and events.  Personal data is also
   processed as our services reasonably require, to communicate updates,
   troubleshoot issues with the service, and to respond to and resolve
   user queries about the service.  Regarding organisational
   communications, these are processed on the basis of personal data
   provided by users of the MO Zone website (http://mozone.gs1.org).
   Processing personal data for marketing and organisational communication
   purposes is done on the legal basis of user consent and otherwise, for
   GS1’s legitimate interests of marketing its news and events to
   interested members and users.  Processing personal data to communicate
   with users about services they use is done pursuant to GS1’s legitimate
   interest of providing ongoing services and related service support to
   its users.

   Services
   Personal data is processed to operationally provide our services to
   users and ensure that the services are protected, to the extent
   possible, from unauthorised access and use.  Such processing also
   includes to: process business transactions; establish and maintain
   customer accounts; communicate with you about updates, maintenance,
   outages or other technical matters relating to the services; provide
   training; notify you about changes to our policies and procedures;
   verify the accuracy of account and technical contact information; and
   respond to user inquiries.
   The legal basis for such processing is GS1’s legitimate interest of
   providing and maintaining the services, and ensuring security of these
   systems.

   Social Media Integration & Plugins
   GS1 integrates content from its YouTube channel, Twitter and LinkedIn
   accounts (“social media platform(s)”) to its Websites. These social
   media platforms can, if buttons are included on our Websites,
   automatically download information technology content.  The pages
   viewed by a user can then automatically send data to these social media
   platforms.  Through this technical process, the social media platform
   may receive personally identifiable information, such as an IP address
   and browsing habits, to optimise user-directed advertising.  This
   information is stored by the social media platforms in the United
   States of America and may be shared with third parties where
   appropriate.  If the user is logged in to a social media platform with
   their profile, the social media platform recognises the user at each
   activity.  Personal data such as the IP address of the person
   concerned, clicks on pages, access time, access location, the frequency
   of visits, links of origin, follow-on links and data on the length of
   stay on the website are sent.  The social media platforms may, if
   buttons are included on our Websites, monitor user activity.

   GS1 Websites embed content and uses social plugins ("plugins") from
   social media platforms.  If you visit a page of our Websites that
   contains such plugin, your browser connects directly to the servers of
   the social media platform.  The content of the plugin is transmitted by
   the social media platform directly to your browser and integrated into
   the webpage.  By integrating the plugin, the social media provider
   receives the information that your browser has accessed the
   corresponding page of our Website.  This also applies if you do not
   have a profile or are currently not logged in to the respective social
   media platform.  This information (including your IP address) is
   transmitted by your browser directly to a server of the social media
   platform (possibly in the US) and stored at that location.  If you are
   logged in to one of the social media platforms, the provider can
   directly allocate the visit to our Website to your profile in the
   respective social media platform.  If you interact with the plugins
   (for example by clicking the "Like" or "Share" buttons), the
   corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a social
   media platform server and stored at that location.  The information may
   also be posted on the social media platform and displayed to your
   contacts.  This type of processing is necessary for the optimal
   marketing of our services, which is a legitimate interest of GS1.

   If you do not want social media platforms to assign the data collected
   via our Websites directly to your profile in the corresponding social
   media platform, you must log out of the corresponding service before
   you visit our Websites.  You can prevent the plugins from being loaded,
   even with add-ons for your browser, using the script blocker "NoScript"
   (http://noscript.net/).

   Legal Compliance
   GS1 must comply with its legal obligations (for example as directed by
   regulatory authorities or under a Court order) and in such
   circumstances, it may be necessary for us to process personal data for
   these reasons.
   Cookies
   Cookies are small files stored on your computer when you access our
   Website.  They have various functions including: allowing you to
   navigate smoothly between pages on the Website, remembering your
   preferences and improving the overall experience of the Website.
   GS1 uses the following cookies on this Website:
     * Persistent cookies: These allow us to improve how the website
       collects information, enhancing your experience of the site over
       time; and
     * Session cookies: These store information about your current
       browsing session, helping you to navigate between pages.

   You can enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your
   browser.  You can find out how to do this and obtain more information
   on cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.

5. Data Storage

   GS1 will store and process your personal data for the purposes stated
   in this Privacy Policy.  GS1 retains your personal data for the period
   of time necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy
   Policy, subject to extension as permitted by law, and will delete your
   personal data after such time that it is no longer required.

6. Data Transfers & Recipients

   Disclosure to Third Parties
   GS1 may disclose your personal data, as necessary, to third party
   processors for the purpose of developing the Websites and services, and
   marketing and organisational communications on behalf of GS1.  When
   personal data is shared with third party recipients for such purposes,
   it is shared subject in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as
   authorised and instructed by GS1.
   If required by law, GS1 may disclose personal data upon request of a
   public authority and upon receipt of a Court order, or similar, to
   disclose personal data.

   Cross-Border Transfers
   In some cases it may be necessary to transfer personal data to
   international businesses and/or organisations (that is, outside of the
   European Union).  In such instances, personal data will be transferred
   subject to necessary safeguards including pursuant to adequacy
   decisions of the European Commission or a contractual agreement between
   GS1 and the international processor.  Further information about such
   transfers may be requested via privacy@gs1.org.

7. Protection of Personal Data

   All information collected via the Websites and services are saved and
   stored in secure operating environments and is only accessible by
   authorised personnel.  The Website is monitored regularly to ensure
   that it is secure and data is not being accessed or used improperly.
   The Website is protected by appropriate security measures to safeguard,
   prevent loss, unlawful use and unauthorised access to personal data to
   the maximum reasonable extent.

8. Your Rights

   Accessing your Personal Data
   When you request access to your personal data, and such request is
   reasonable and proportionate, GS1 will provide such service free of
   charge, however if your request requires disproportionate technical or
   administrative effort GS1 may charge a fee.
   If you request access to your personal data, GS1 may request
   verification of your identity to ensure to the fullest extent possible
   that personal data is not unlawfully disclosed – failure to adequately
   validate your identity may result in GS1’s refusal to allow access to
   requested personal data.

   Data Accuracy
   You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your personal data
   by contacting GS1 to notify us of any changes to or errors in your
   personal data.  You have the right to access your personal data stored
   by the Websites and services to update, amend and rectify your personal
   data record.

   Erasure
   You have the right to have your personal data erased, noting that
   without the retention of your personal data, access to the Websites and

   Withdrawing Consent
   You also have the right to withdraw your consent to your data being
   processed at any time, without affecting the lawful processing of your
   personal data before such withdrawal.

   Objection
   You have the right to object, in whole or in part, to your personal
   data being collected and processed pursuant to GS1’s legitimate
   interests.  In such case, we will no longer process personal data -
   except where the compelling legitimate grounds to continue the
   processing override the interests, rights and freedoms of the user, or
   to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

   Restricted Processing
   Users have the right to restrict processing of their personal data if
   (i) accuracy of the personal data is contested for the period of time
   in which GS1 can verify the accuracy of the personal data, (ii)
   processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes erasure of the
   personal data and requests restricted processing instead, (iii) GS1 no
   longer needs the personal data for the purpose of processing but is
   required by the data subject to establish, exercise or defend legal
   claims, and (iv) the user objects to processing pending verification
   whether GS1’s legitimate grounds prevail over those of the user.  Where
   processing has been restricted under the above bases, such personal
   data (save for storage) will only be processed with a user’s consent or
   to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights
   or interests of another individual in the public interest.

   Personal Data Portability
   Users have the right to request and receive their personal data in a
   structured way as well as the right to have their personal data
   transmitted to another processor, where technically feasible and not
   adversely affecting the rights and freedoms of others.

9. Complaints

   If you have a complaint about the way GS1 handles or processes your
   personal data, you may lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory
   authority, which for GS1 is the Data Protection Authority (Belgium). At
   first instance, we recommend that you direct any concerns or complaints
   to privacy@gs1.org.
