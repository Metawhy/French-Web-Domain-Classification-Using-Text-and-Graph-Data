   Friendly Local Cafe

   Cafe Kaficko is a short walk from Prague Castle, and it is well worth a
   visit. Mostly frequented by locals, it offers a great selection of
   coffees, excellent service and delicious cakes. I could not recommend
   it more. Would definitely visit again.

   Best honey cake

   The place is a small cafe in the old streets of Prague near the famous
   Charles bridge. They have the best honey cake I ate.

   Wanted to try Medovnìk and after searching TripAdvisor reviews we

   A hidden gem

   If you are tired of the crowds, overpriced touristy cafes amd loud
   music in the historical city center, go have a rest here. The
   atnosphere is very relaxing and their coffee and Czech wines just
   delicious!

   Mala Strana (Little Quarter)
   Malá Strana is one of the oldest and the most
   beautiful neighbourhoods in the city. Nestled
   underneath Prague Castle it was once a part of the
   Kings route taken by future kings on their way to
   coronation - originating in the Old Town, crossing
   Charles Bridge and leading to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
   Cobblestone streets are lined with picturesque
   medieval houses, remarkable palaces, churches, kitsch
   ...More
   shops and restaurants. Do not hesitate to turn a
   corner into any narrow street. You will suddenly find
   yourself in a calm and charming neighbourhood full of
   hidden gardens, parks with peacocks, fruit trees and
   ponds. As the neighbourhood is a home to Czech
   Parliament and many ministries, you can also run into
   well-dressed officials. If you are thirsty or hungry,
   it is the right place to be. Restaurants offer
   delicious traditional food and of course, the best
   Czech beers.

   A bakery on the doorstep of our apartment with a tiny eating area

   Good coffee & pastry

   Nice atmosphere and service, it is a place in the centre to have a
   little break and enjoy pastry, cakes and drink something hot to get
   warm on a cold/rainy day. Although, prices are not low (for the eastern
   european people).

   Fresh and delicious

   We ordered quiche and chicken pasty. It was heated for us. It was
   delicious. Crust was flaky. Tomato chutney on the side was flavorful .
   Fresh orange juice squeezed to order. Good coffee. Service efficient

   Mala Strana (Little Quarter)
   Malá Strana is one of the oldest and the most
   beautiful neighbourhoods in the city. Nestled
   underneath Prague Castle it was once a part of the
   Kings route taken by future kings on their way to
   coronation - originating in the Old Town, crossing
   Charles Bridge and leading to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
   Cobblestone streets are lined with picturesque
   medieval houses, remarkable palaces, churches, kitsch
   ...More
   shops and restaurants. Do not hesitate to turn a
   corner into any narrow street. You will suddenly find
   yourself in a calm and charming neighbourhood full of
   hidden gardens, parks with peacocks, fruit trees and
   ponds. As the neighbourhood is a home to Czech
   Parliament and many ministries, you can also run into
   well-dressed officials. If you are thirsty or hungry,
   it is the right place to be. Restaurants offer
   delicious traditional food and of course, the best
   Czech beers.

   The main bakery is very close to the hotel. It is called Bakeshop and
   is at Kozi 1, Old Town, open from 7am to 9pm. Bakeshop Little Bakery is
   a 10 to 15 minute walk and you will need to cross the Vltava River to
   get to us. You can cross Manesuv Most or the busier Karlluv most
   (Charles Bridge). We are open from 9am to 7pm. Hope you find us during

   Mala Strana (Little Quarter)
   Malá Strana is one of the oldest and the most
   beautiful neighbourhoods in the city. Nestled
   underneath Prague Castle it was once a part of the
   Kings route taken by future kings on their way to
   coronation - originating in the Old Town, crossing
   Charles Bridge and leading to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
   Cobblestone streets are lined with picturesque
   medieval houses, remarkable palaces, churches, kitsch
   ...More
   shops and restaurants. Do not hesitate to turn a
   corner into any narrow street. You will suddenly find
   yourself in a calm and charming neighbourhood full of
   hidden gardens, parks with peacocks, fruit trees and
   ponds. As the neighbourhood is a home to Czech
   Parliament and many ministries, you can also run into
   well-dressed officials. If you are thirsty or hungry,
   it is the right place to be. Restaurants offer
   delicious traditional food and of course, the best
   Czech beers.

What travellers are saying

   If you explore around Prague long enough you will find many great
   examples of the work of David Cerny, this sculpture located in the
   grounds of the Kafka Museum is indicative of the art form if this
   genius is famo...
   Loved this unusual sculpture by David Cerny, worth a detour to see the
   sculptures peeing in a puddle that is the Czech Republic.
   We came across this statue as we headed back from Prague Castle to
   Charles Bridge, it is located in a courtyard next to a cute gingerbread
   shop.

   Controversial political sculpture

   This Cerny sculpture is outside the Frank Kafka museum. The sculpture
   is well executed and interesting to video. The fact that it is a Czech
   map makes it controversial, and perhaps signifies the artist's
   political leanings.

   Controversial, maybe...bizarre, possibly...

   Interesting concept, from a political perspective...but I found it
   rather bizarre when I saw this sculpture being shown to little school

   Mala Strana (Little Quarter)
   Malá Strana is one of the oldest and the most
   beautiful neighbourhoods in the city. Nestled
   underneath Prague Castle it was once a part of the
   Kings route taken by future kings on their way to
   coronation - originating in the Old Town, crossing
   Charles Bridge and leading to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
   Cobblestone streets are lined with picturesque
   medieval houses, remarkable palaces, churches, kitsch
   ...More
   shops and restaurants. Do not hesitate to turn a
   corner into any narrow street. You will suddenly find
   yourself in a calm and charming neighbourhood full of
   hidden gardens, parks with peacocks, fruit trees and
   ponds. As the neighbourhood is a home to Czech
   Parliament and many ministries, you can also run into
   well-dressed officials. If you are thirsty or hungry,
   it is the right place to be. Restaurants offer
   delicious traditional food and of course, the best
   Czech beers.
