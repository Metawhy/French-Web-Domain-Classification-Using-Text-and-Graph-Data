Exclusive: OnePlus 7T renders reveal circular triple camera module, McLaren
“Senna” Edition also tipped

   Earlier this year, Pricebaba brought you exclusive renders of the
   OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro in association with the notable tipster OnLeaks.
   Both smartphones were launched in May this year, and their successors,
   the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro, are tipped to go official on September
   26th alongside the OnePlus TV. Ahead of the launch, we’ve collaborated
   with OnLeaks once again to bring you exclusive 5K renders and a
   360-degree video of the upcoming OnePlus 7T. OnLeaks also mentions that
   OnePlus will launch a OnePlus 7T McLaren “Senna” Edition, although he
   didn’t share any details regarding this device.

   Just yesterday, we saw leaked sketches of the OnePlus 7T’s back panel
   with a circular camera module, and now, we can confirm that this is
   accurate. OnLeaks’ renders reveal a circular camera bump for the 7T,
   which has three cameras placed horizontally in a single line, with the
   dual LED flash below. The cameras are separated by angular lines that
   look a tad out of place. Notably, the OnePlus 7 (review) featured dual
   cameras, so this is a significant update for the 7T. The back panel is
   curved and made of glass just like its predecessor, and features the
   OnePlus logo in the centre.

   Moving to the front, many users might be disappointed that the OnePlus
   7T retains the waterdrop notch and flat display of its predecessor.
   OnLeaks confirms that the display measures roughly 6.5-inches
   (rectangular measurement) or 6.4-inches (rounded corners measurement).
   The dimensions of the phone are 161.2 x 74.5 x 8.3mm. There’s a single
   selfie camera inside the notch.

   As for the ports and buttons, you get the power button and alert slider
   on the right side, and the volume rocker on the left. The bottom edge
   is home to the USB Type-C port, loudspeaker grill and ejectable SIM
   card tray. There’s an earpiece right above the notch, and a secondary
   microphone on the top edge.

   As of now, not much else is known about the OnePlus 7T. We can expect
   it to be powered by the Snapdragon 855+ chipset, and come with up to
   8GB RAM and up to 256GB of non-expandable storage. The screen is likely
   to be a full HD+ Optic AMOLED panel.

   Both the in-screen fingerprint sensor and face unlock options are a
   given, as is OxygenOS based on Android 9 Pie, which will likely be
   upgraded to Android 10 soon after launch. The OnePlus 7 featured a 48MP
   Sony IMX586 primary camera, assisted by a 5MP depth sensor, so the
   third camera on the 7T could either be a wide-angle or telephoto
   lens. These specifications are just speculation at this point, but with
   the launch drawing close, we won’t have to wait long for details.
