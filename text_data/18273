Minimalist Baker About #minimalistbaker #recipes #vegan #simple

Welcome, everyone.

   Minimalist Baker celebrates simple cooking by sharing recipes that
   require 10 ingredients or less, 1 bowl, or 30 minute or less to
   prepare. All eaters are welcome.

   Whether you’re new to Minimalist Baker or have been around for a while,
   we’re so glad you’re here.

The Recipes

   All of our recipes fall into at least one of these three simple
   categories:
     * 30 minutes or less
     * 1 bowl
     * 10 ingredients or less*

   If you don’t have fancy ingredients, expensive equipment, or hours to
   cook meals every night, you’re in the right place. We hope Minimalist
   Baker is a useful resource for people who love delicious, simple food.

   Expect new recipes every three days, with a mix of savory and sweet,
   including desserts, breakfasts, entrées, and more. (All recipes found
   here.)

   While many of the recipes on Minimalist Baker are plant-based, we are
   not an exclusively vegan or plant-based website. We welcome all eaters
   and require all discussion to be kind and respectful of other members.

   *We don’t count water or “optional” ingredients toward the 10
   ingredient count. And we typically count “salt and pepper” as one
   ingredient.

Does ‘Baker’ mean only dessert?

   While there’s always been a love for sweet things, Minimalist Baker is
   about much more. We love our hearty entrées as much as we love our
   decadent desserts. Whether you have dietary restrictions or not, we
   hope you’ll find something you love here. Find all of our recipes here.

No Sponsored Content

   We feel that it’s important to mention we don’t accept free products or
   do sponsored content on Minimalist Baker. This is because we value our
   readers’ trust above all and aim to keep our content pure and honest.

   While we have worked with brands we love in the past, it’s something
   we’ve chosen not to practice moving forward. We want our audience to
   know we aren’t being paid to say or promote anything – period. Every
   new post is original, valuable, and unsponsored.

Who is Minimalist Baker?

   Dana is the primary recipe developer, content creator, and food
   photographer behind Minimalist Baker. She has been blogging in some
   form since 2010 and developed a deep love for recipe experimentation
   and food photography in the process. Dana’s food philosophy has evolved
   greatly over the last several years, and she now enjoys a diverse diet
   free from labels.

   She is the author of Minimalist Baker’s Everyday Cooking, and
   co-creator of Food Photography School, Food Video School, and the
   Essentials of Building a Great Food Blog Course. She’s also an aspiring
   yogi, lover of all things green, and her go-to morning drink is a
   creamy matcha latte.

   While Dana leads content development and John manages all things
   technical, we are now a small team of people working to make Minimalist
   Baker a destination for simple recipes.
