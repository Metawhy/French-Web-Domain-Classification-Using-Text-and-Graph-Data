Abstract

   In comparisons among Chicago neighbourhoods, homicide rates in 1988-93
   varied more than 100-fold, while male life expectancy at birth ranged
   from 54 to 77 years, even with effects of homicide mortality removed.
   This “cause deleted” life expectancy was highly correlated with
   homicide rates; a measure of economic inequality added significant
   additional prediction, whereas median household income did not. Deaths
   from internal causes (diseases) show similar age patterns, despite
   different absolute levels, in the best and worst neighbourhoods,
   whereas deaths from external causes (homicide, accident, suicide) do
   not. As life expectancy declines across neighbourhoods, women reproduce
   earlier; by age 30, however, neighbourhood no longer affects age
   specific fertility. These results support the hypothesis that life
   expectancy itself may be a psychologically salient determinant of risk
   taking and the timing of life transitions.

Introduction

   Psychologists, economists, and criminologists have found that young
   adults, poor people, and criminal offenders all tend to discount the
   future relatively steeply.1 2 3 4 5 6 Such tendencies have been called
   “impulsivity” and “short time horizons” or, more pejoratively,
   impatience, myopia, lack of self control, and incapacity to delay
   gratification. Behind the use of such terms lies a presumption that
   steep discounting is dysfunctional and that the appropriate weighting
   of present rewards against future investments is independent of life
   stage and socioeconomic circumstance.

   There is an alternative view: adjustment of discount rates in relation
   to age and other variables is just what we should expect of an evolved
   psyche functioning normally.5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Steep discounting may be a
   “rational” response to information that indicates an uncertain or low
   probability of surviving to reap delayed benefits, for example, and
   “reckless” risk taking can be optimal when the expected profits from
   safer courses of action are negligible.7 8 12 13

Hypothesis 1

   Criminal violence can be considered an outcome of steep future
   discounting6 and escalation of risk in social competition.10 This is
   especially true of homicide in urban parts of the United States, where
   a large majority of cases involve competition for status or resources
   among unrelated men7 9 and even marital homicides result from sexual
   proprietariness in the shadow of male-male competition.14 15 This line
   of reasoning suggests that criminal violence will vary in relation to
   local indicators of life expectancy, hence our first hypothesis:
   homicide rates will vary as a function of local life expectancy.

Hypothesis 2

   Sensitivity to inequality is an expected feature of a psyche that
   adjusts risk acceptance as we envision, because those at the bottom may
   be especially motivated to escalate their tactics of social competition
   when it is clear that some “winners” are doing very well and when the
   expected payoffs from low risk tactics are poor.12 This expectation
   accords with arguments that mortality is exacerbated by inequality
   itself, over and above the compromising effects of simply being poor on
   nutrition, access to medical care, safety, and other health promoting
   opportunities.16 17 Recent papers in the BMJ have presented evidence
   that economic inequality predicts mortality in general, and moreover
   that it is most strongly related to “external” mortality of the sort
   affected by behavioural risk taking, especially homicide.18 19
   Accordingly, our second hypothesis is that economic inequality will
   account for additional variance in homicidal violence besides that
   accounted for by local life expectancy.

   Previous demonstrations of the effects of inequality on homicide have
   focused primarily on comparisons between nations, American states, or
   cities.18 19 20 21 The arguments presented above suggest that the
   relevant processes of social comparison might operate more locally,
   with the lives and deaths of people known personally being especially
   salient to one's mental model of life prospects. We have therefore
   compared neighbourhoods within a large city. This may also be a good
   level at which to detect the relations of interest because variables
   such as latitude, weather, urbanness, laws, history, and prevailing
   political practices complicate comparisons among larger jurisdictions.

Hypothesis 3

   Finally, if low life expectancy is indeed psychologically salient in
   the ways we envision, it will inspire short time horizons in other
   domains of behavioural decision making as well. Life expectancy cues
   might thus affect inclinations to invest in the future through
   education, preventive health measures, and savings, as well as
   decisions about the timing of major transitions and life events.
   Geronimus's studies of young mothers support these ideas: although
   early reproduction among urban poor people is commonly viewed as an
   instance of social pathology and failure to exercise choice, she has
   shown that teenage pregnancy is often an active decision, motivated in
   large part by expectations about a life course more compressed in time
   than that of more affluent people.22 23 Her interviewees in urban
   ghettoes in the United States expressly wished to become mothers and
   grandmothers while still young and competent because they anticipated
   problems of early “weathering” and poor health. Thus, our third
   hypothesis is that reproduction will occur earlier in the lifespan as
   one moves from neighbourhoods with high life expectancy to those with
   low life expectancy.

Data sources

   There are 77 “community areas” with relatively stable boundaries in the
   American city of Chicago. We used demographic data for 1988-93 for
   these 77 neighbourhoods (vital statistics obtained from the Illinois
   Department of Public Health) and population data from the 1990 census.
   Following Schoen's method,24 we used these data to compute male and
   female life expectancies at birth for each neighbourhood, “cause
   deleted” in that effects of homicide mortality were removed. We also
   computed sex and age specific mortality for different causes of death
   and age specific birth rates. We used counts of the number of
   households in each of 25 income intervals, derived from 1990 United
   States Census population and housing summary tape file 3A, to compute
   the Robin Hood index of income inequality (the maximum deviation of the
   Lorenz curve of cumulative share of total income from the straight line
   that would represent zero income variance19) for each neighbourhood.

Life expectancy and homicide

   Neighbourhood specific, cause deleted male life expectancy at birth
   (range 54.3 to 77.4 years) and homicide rates (range 1.3 to 156 per 100
   000 per year) are highly correlated, confirming our first hypothesis
   (fig 1; r=-0.88, P<0.0001).

   Table 1) shows the bivariate correlations among homicide rates, cause
   deleted life expectancies, median household income (adjusted to remove
   effects of mean household size, which was correlated with median
   household income across the 77 neighbourhoods at r=-0.32), and a
   measure of income inequality. All pairs of measures were highly
   correlated (all P values <0.0001), but male life expectancy was more
   strongly related to both economic measures and to the homicide rate
   than was female life expectancy, and male life expectancy predicted the
   homicide rate better than either economic measure. Stepwise multiple
   regression indicated that economic inequality adds significantly to the
   prediction of homicide rate that is afforded by life expectancy,
   supporting our second hypothesis. The adjusted median household income
   is apparently of less relevance than inequality, a result that is
   consistent with previous findings from comparisons among larger
   politico-geographic units,18 19 20 21 but since the two economic
   measures are so highly correlated, this conclusion must be tentative.

Mortality patterns in best and worst neighbourhoods

   Figure 2) shows age specific and sex specific death rates,
   distinguishing death by homicide and other “external” causes (accidents
   and suicides) from death by “internal” causes (all other causes—that
   is, by disease, broadly construed). The figure includes data only for
   the 10 neighbourhoods with the shortest life expectancies (panels on
   right) and the 10 with the longest (panels on left). Neighbourhoods
   with low life expectancy have higher levels of all sorts of mortality
   in virtually all age-sex categories; however, although the pattern of
   risk of death from internal causes across the lifespan is similar in
   the best and worst neighbourhoods, age related patterns of external
   mortality are quite different. These patterns support the idea that
   differential rates of external mortality are largely a result of
   differentials in risk acceptance and future discounting, especially in
   young adults. (Although perpetrating a homicide, rather than becoming a
   victim, might be thought to reflect risk acceptance and future
   discounting, the age-sex patterns for perpetrators and victims are
   similar,9 largely because homicides in Chicago arise primarily from
   competitive interactions between male victims and killers who are drawn
   from the same demographic groups.)

Life expectancy and age specific birth rates

   Table 2) shows age specific birth rates for the 10 neighbourhoods with
   the highest life expectancies, the 10 with the lowest, and the 10
   nearest the median. Teenage birth rates are dramatically different, but
   the differentials decline rapidly and have vanished by age 30. The
   median age of women giving birth (the “generation time”) was 22.6 years
   in the neighbourhoods with low life expectancy, compared with 25.4
   years in the intermediate neighbourhoods and 27.3 years in the
   neighbourhoods with long life expectancy. These differences are
   consistent with our third hypothesis and support Geronimus's
   suggestion22 23 that the relatively high birth rates in young women in
   the worst neighbourhoods often reflect a distinct family planning
   schedule rather than a mere absence of family planning.

Effect of life expectancy

   Life expectancy reflects not only affluence but such additional
   considerations as local pathogen loads, health care, and risk of
   violent death, and it may thus provide a more encompassing quality of
   life index than economic measures alone. More than just providing a
   useful epidemiological index, however, an “expectation” of future
   lifespan may be psychologically salient in its own right, although it
   need not be a conscious expectation. The data presented here indicate
   that people behave as if they have adjusted their rates of future
   discounting and risk acceptance thresholds in relation to local life
   expectancy, and that they do so in the non-violent domain of
   reproductive decision making as well as in the potentially violent
   domain of social competition.

   How could such a statistical abstraction as life expectancy be a cause
   of anything? One possibility is that the human psyche produces what is
   in effect a semi-statistical apprehension of the distribution of local
   lifespans, based on the fates of other relevant people.10 If a young
   man's grandfathers were both dead before he was born, for example, and
   some of his primary school classmates had already died, discounting the
   future could be a normal, adaptive reaction. Moreover, if much of this
   mortality seems to represent “bad luck” incurred more or less
   independently of the decedents' choices of action, then accepting more
   risks in the pursuit of immediate advantage would also make sense.

   These inference processes are unlikely to be transparent to
   introspection, but they may be revealed in expressed attitudes and
   expectations. Ethnographic studies of urban poor people in American
   cities contain many articulate statements about the perceived risk of
   early death, the unpredictability of future resources, and the futility
   of long term planning.25 26 27 28 One interesting question for
   psychological research is how the relevant mental models and subjective
   values develop and are adjusted over the lifespan.29 30 Another is
   whether media representations, even fictitious ones, can affect such
   development in the same way as information about known relatives and
   neighbours. These questions may best be addressed from an evolutionary
   psychological perspective, which credits the mind with functional
   “design” for solving important problems of living in society and making
   decisions under uncertainty.10 29 31 32 Such an approach has already
   shed considerable light on detailed aspects of sex differences and age
   effects.5 9

Feedback effects

   The regression analysis in table 1) and our emphasis on life expectancy
   as a predictive variable must not be taken to imply that economic
   inequality plays only a secondary role. Considerable evidence indicates
   that such inequality is itself a major determinant of life expectancy
   variation,17 so the more basic (and remediable) causes of violence and
   other manifestations of steep future discounting are socioeconomic and
   structural. How our proposal differs from some other accounts is in
   suggesting that inequality has its effects not only by virtue of
   non-adaptive or maladaptive stress effects but also by inspiring a
   “rational” escalation of costly tactics of social competition.7 8 9 10
   33 This consideration complicates causal analysis, because it implies
   that the distribution of age specific mortality is more than an outcome
   variable, having feedback effects on its own causal factors and hence
   on itself. We excluded deaths due to homicide from the analyses in
   table 1) to eliminate spurious autocorrelational effects, but it is
   likely that local levels of homicidal violence affect expectations of
   future life, discount rates, and hence further violence.8
   Table 3

   The number of likely feedback loops among the phenomena of interest is
   daunting. If many people react to a local socioecological milieu by
   discounting the future and lowering their thresholds for risk and
   violence, the behavioural consequences are likely to worsen the very
   problems that provoke them, as well as contributing to fear, distrust,
   and perhaps even economic inequality itself. Living where any resources
   that one accumulates are apt to be expropriated will also exacerbate
   these tendencies. Wilkinson has proposed that the behavioural and
   health effects of unequal resource distributions reflect breakdowns in
   social and community relations, a proposition that we do not dispute.
   But exactly how the correlated phenomena of poverty, inequality,
   injustice, and exogenous threats to life and wellbeing affect the
   perceptions, motives, and actions of individuals remains to be
   elucidated. The causal links are several and multidirectional, but we
   cannot let that deter us from trying to disentangle them.

Abstract

   In comparisons among Chicago neighbourhoods, homicide rates in 1988-93
   varied more than 100-fold, while male life expectancy at birth ranged
   from 54 to 77 years, even with effects of homicide mortality removed.
   This “cause deleted” life expectancy was highly correlated with
   homicide rates; a measure of economic inequality added significant
   additional prediction, whereas median household income did not. Deaths
   from internal causes (diseases) show similar age patterns, despite
   different absolute levels, in the best and worst neighbourhoods,
   whereas deaths from external causes (homicide, accident, suicide) do
   not. As life expectancy declines across neighbourhoods, women reproduce
   earlier; by age 30, however, neighbourhood no longer affects age
   specific fertility. These results support the hypothesis that life
   expectancy itself may be a psychologically salient determinant of risk
   taking and the timing of life transitions.

Introduction

   Psychologists, economists, and criminologists have found that young
   adults, poor people, and criminal offenders all tend to discount the
   future relatively steeply.1 2 3 4 5 6 Such tendencies have been called
   “impulsivity” and “short time horizons” or, more pejoratively,
   impatience, myopia, lack of self control, and incapacity to delay
   gratification. Behind the use of such terms lies a presumption that
   steep discounting is dysfunctional and that the appropriate weighting
   of present rewards against future investments is independent of life
   stage and socioeconomic circumstance.

   There is an alternative view: adjustment of discount rates in relation
   to age and other variables is just what we should expect of an evolved
   psyche functioning normally.5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Steep discounting may be a
   “rational” response to information that indicates an uncertain or low
   probability of surviving to reap delayed benefits, for example, and
   “reckless” risk taking can be optimal when the expected profits from
   safer courses of action are negligible.7 8 12 13

Hypothesis 1

   Criminal violence can be considered an outcome of steep future
   discounting6 and escalation of risk in social competition.10 This is
   especially true of homicide in urban parts of the United States, where
   a large majority of cases involve competition for status or resources
   among unrelated men7 9 and even marital homicides result from sexual
   proprietariness in the shadow of male-male competition.14 15 This line
   of reasoning suggests that criminal violence will vary in relation to
   local indicators of life expectancy, hence our first hypothesis:
   homicide rates will vary as a function of local life expectancy.

Hypothesis 2

   Sensitivity to inequality is an expected feature of a psyche that
   adjusts risk acceptance as we envision, because those at the bottom may
   be especially motivated to escalate their tactics of social competition
   when it is clear that some “winners” are doing very well and when the
   expected payoffs from low risk tactics are poor.12 This expectation
   accords with arguments that mortality is exacerbated by inequality
   itself, over and above the compromising effects of simply being poor on
   nutrition, access to medical care, safety, and other health promoting
   opportunities.16 17 Recent papers in the BMJ have presented evidence
   that economic inequality predicts mortality in general, and moreover
   that it is most strongly related to “external” mortality of the sort
   affected by behavioural risk taking, especially homicide.18 19
   Accordingly, our second hypothesis is that economic inequality will
   account for additional variance in homicidal violence besides that
   accounted for by local life expectancy.

   Previous demonstrations of the effects of inequality on homicide have
   focused primarily on comparisons between nations, American states, or
   cities.18 19 20 21 The arguments presented above suggest that the
   relevant processes of social comparison might operate more locally,
   with the lives and deaths of people known personally being especially
   salient to one's mental model of life prospects. We have therefore
   compared neighbourhoods within a large city. This may also be a good
   level at which to detect the relations of interest because variables
   such as latitude, weather, urbanness, laws, history, and prevailing
   political practices complicate comparisons among larger jurisdictions.

Hypothesis 3

   Finally, if low life expectancy is indeed psychologically salient in
   the ways we envision, it will inspire short time horizons in other
   domains of behavioural decision making as well. Life expectancy cues
   might thus affect inclinations to invest in the future through
   education, preventive health measures, and savings, as well as
   decisions about the timing of major transitions and life events.
   Geronimus's studies of young mothers support these ideas: although
   early reproduction among urban poor people is commonly viewed as an
   instance of social pathology and failure to exercise choice, she has
   shown that teenage pregnancy is often an active decision, motivated in
   large part by expectations about a life course more compressed in time
   than that of more affluent people.22 23 Her interviewees in urban
   ghettoes in the United States expressly wished to become mothers and
   grandmothers while still young and competent because they anticipated
   problems of early “weathering” and poor health. Thus, our third
   hypothesis is that reproduction will occur earlier in the lifespan as
   one moves from neighbourhoods with high life expectancy to those with
   low life expectancy.

Data sources

   There are 77 “community areas” with relatively stable boundaries in the
   American city of Chicago. We used demographic data for 1988-93 for
   these 77 neighbourhoods (vital statistics obtained from the Illinois
   Department of Public Health) and population data from the 1990 census.
   Following Schoen's method,24 we used these data to compute male and
   female life expectancies at birth for each neighbourhood, “cause
   deleted” in that effects of homicide mortality were removed. We also
   computed sex and age specific mortality for different causes of death
   and age specific birth rates. We used counts of the number of
   households in each of 25 income intervals, derived from 1990 United
   States Census population and housing summary tape file 3A, to compute
   the Robin Hood index of income inequality (the maximum deviation of the
   Lorenz curve of cumulative share of total income from the straight line
   that would represent zero income variance19) for each neighbourhood.

Life expectancy and homicide

   Neighbourhood specific, cause deleted male life expectancy at birth
   (range 54.3 to 77.4 years) and homicide rates (range 1.3 to 156 per 100
   000 per year) are highly correlated, confirming our first hypothesis
   (fig 1; r=-0.88, P<0.0001).

   Table 1) shows the bivariate correlations among homicide rates, cause
   deleted life expectancies, median household income (adjusted to remove
   effects of mean household size, which was correlated with median
   household income across the 77 neighbourhoods at r=-0.32), and a
   measure of income inequality. All pairs of measures were highly
   correlated (all P values <0.0001), but male life expectancy was more
   strongly related to both economic measures and to the homicide rate
   than was female life expectancy, and male life expectancy predicted the
   homicide rate better than either economic measure. Stepwise multiple
   regression indicated that economic inequality adds significantly to the
   prediction of homicide rate that is afforded by life expectancy,
   supporting our second hypothesis. The adjusted median household income
   is apparently of less relevance than inequality, a result that is
   consistent with previous findings from comparisons among larger
   politico-geographic units,18 19 20 21 but since the two economic
   measures are so highly correlated, this conclusion must be tentative.

Mortality patterns in best and worst neighbourhoods

   Figure 2) shows age specific and sex specific death rates,
   distinguishing death by homicide and other “external” causes (accidents
   and suicides) from death by “internal” causes (all other causes—that
   is, by disease, broadly construed). The figure includes data only for
   the 10 neighbourhoods with the shortest life expectancies (panels on
   right) and the 10 with the longest (panels on left). Neighbourhoods
   with low life expectancy have higher levels of all sorts of mortality
   in virtually all age-sex categories; however, although the pattern of
   risk of death from internal causes across the lifespan is similar in
   the best and worst neighbourhoods, age related patterns of external
   mortality are quite different. These patterns support the idea that
   differential rates of external mortality are largely a result of
   differentials in risk acceptance and future discounting, especially in
   young adults. (Although perpetrating a homicide, rather than becoming a
   victim, might be thought to reflect risk acceptance and future
   discounting, the age-sex patterns for perpetrators and victims are
   similar,9 largely because homicides in Chicago arise primarily from
   competitive interactions between male victims and killers who are drawn
   from the same demographic groups.)

   expectancy (right panels), Chicago, 1988-93

Life expectancy and age specific birth rates

   Table 2) shows age specific birth rates for the 10 neighbourhoods with
   the highest life expectancies, the 10 with the lowest, and the 10
   nearest the median. Teenage birth rates are dramatically different, but
   the differentials decline rapidly and have vanished by age 30. The
   median age of women giving birth (the “generation time”) was 22.6 years
   in the neighbourhoods with low life expectancy, compared with 25.4
   years in the intermediate neighbourhoods and 27.3 years in the
   neighbourhoods with long life expectancy. These differences are
   consistent with our third hypothesis and support Geronimus's
   suggestion22 23 that the relatively high birth rates in young women in
   the worst neighbourhoods often reflect a distinct family planning
   schedule rather than a mere absence of family planning.

Effect of life expectancy

   Life expectancy reflects not only affluence but such additional
   considerations as local pathogen loads, health care, and risk of
   violent death, and it may thus provide a more encompassing quality of
   life index than economic measures alone. More than just providing a
   useful epidemiological index, however, an “expectation” of future
   lifespan may be psychologically salient in its own right, although it
   need not be a conscious expectation. The data presented here indicate
   that people behave as if they have adjusted their rates of future
   discounting and risk acceptance thresholds in relation to local life
   expectancy, and that they do so in the non-violent domain of
   reproductive decision making as well as in the potentially violent
   domain of social competition.

   How could such a statistical abstraction as life expectancy be a cause
   of anything? One possibility is that the human psyche produces what is
   in effect a semi-statistical apprehension of the distribution of local
   lifespans, based on the fates of other relevant people.10 If a young
   man's grandfathers were both dead before he was born, for example, and
   some of his primary school classmates had already died, discounting the
   future could be a normal, adaptive reaction. Moreover, if much of this
   mortality seems to represent “bad luck” incurred more or less
   independently of the decedents' choices of action, then accepting more
   risks in the pursuit of immediate advantage would also make sense.

   These inference processes are unlikely to be transparent to
   introspection, but they may be revealed in expressed attitudes and
   expectations. Ethnographic studies of urban poor people in American
   cities contain many articulate statements about the perceived risk of
   early death, the unpredictability of future resources, and the futility
   of long term planning.25 26 27 28 One interesting question for
   psychological research is how the relevant mental models and subjective
   values develop and are adjusted over the lifespan.29 30 Another is
   whether media representations, even fictitious ones, can affect such
   development in the same way as information about known relatives and
   neighbours. These questions may best be addressed from an evolutionary
   psychological perspective, which credits the mind with functional
   “design” for solving important problems of living in society and making
   decisions under uncertainty.10 29 31 32 Such an approach has already
   shed considerable light on detailed aspects of sex differences and age
   effects.5 9

Feedback effects

   The regression analysis in table 1) and our emphasis on life expectancy
   as a predictive variable must not be taken to imply that economic
   inequality plays only a secondary role. Considerable evidence indicates
   that such inequality is itself a major determinant of life expectancy
   variation,17 so the more basic (and remediable) causes of violence and
   other manifestations of steep future discounting are socioeconomic and
   structural. How our proposal differs from some other accounts is in
   suggesting that inequality has its effects not only by virtue of
   non-adaptive or maladaptive stress effects but also by inspiring a
   “rational” escalation of costly tactics of social competition.7 8 9 10
   33 This consideration complicates causal analysis, because it implies
   that the distribution of age specific mortality is more than an outcome
   variable, having feedback effects on its own causal factors and hence
   on itself. We excluded deaths due to homicide from the analyses in
   table 1) to eliminate spurious autocorrelational effects, but it is
   likely that local levels of homicidal violence affect expectations of
   future life, discount rates, and hence further violence.8
   Table 3

   The number of likely feedback loops among the phenomena of interest is
   daunting. If many people react to a local socioecological milieu by
   discounting the future and lowering their thresholds for risk and
   violence, the behavioural consequences are likely to worsen the very
   problems that provoke them, as well as contributing to fear, distrust,
   and perhaps even economic inequality itself. Living where any resources
   that one accumulates are apt to be expropriated will also exacerbate
   these tendencies. Wilkinson has proposed that the behavioural and
   health effects of unequal resource distributions reflect breakdowns in
   social and community relations, a proposition that we do not dispute.
   But exactly how the correlated phenomena of poverty, inequality,
   injustice, and exogenous threats to life and wellbeing affect the
   perceptions, motives, and actions of individuals remains to be
   elucidated. The causal links are several and multidirectional, but we
   cannot let that deter us from trying to disentangle them.
