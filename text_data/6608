The Sumatran Rhino is disappearing

Time is running short to save this species from extinction

   Thousands of Sumatran rhinos once roamed throughout Southeast Asia. But
   in the past decade, their numbers have dwindled to fewer than 80. If we
   don’t act now, we could lose this species forever.
   None

The Problem

   Decades of poaching and habitat loss have cut the number of Sumatran
   rhinos to just 80, who cling to survival in remote populations on two
   Indonesian islands. Their biggest threat now is isolation, and the odds
   of adult rhinos finding compatible mates in the wild are dwindling.



Help Protect Sumatran Rhinos

   Our critical work to save Sumatran rhinos is made possible by support
   from donors like you. With your help, we're working to save these and
   other threatened species — and the habitats they need to survive.
   Together, we can secure a future for Sumatran rhinos and threatened
   species all over the world.

   Divided by land and sea, 10 subpopulations of Sumatran rhinos scattered
   across Indonesia are the species’ last hope for survival.

   RHINOCEROS COLLAPSE

   The number of Sumatran rhinos has dropped

   an estimated 70 percent in the past two

   decades, mostly due to poaching. Fewer than

   a hundred remain in Indonesia, in isolated

   pockets. Sumatran rhinos are solitary creatures.

   They’re small compared with other rhino

   species, and females give birth about every

   three to five years.

   Low Birth Rate

   Small populations mean the Sumatran rhino’s

   potential to reproduce is diminished, putting it

   at a higher risk for extinction.

   Out of Sight

   Sumatran rhinos live in remote areas, so

   sightings are rare and population figures are

   often disputed. Camera traps are the primary

   source of documentation.

How We're Helping

   In 2018, an alliance of conservation organizations, including the
   National Geographic Society, joined together to support the government
   of Indonesia’s national Sumatran rhino conservation breeding effort.
   This rescue effort will relocate rhinos and build facilities for their
   care and breeding in order to bring the species back from the brink of
   extinction.

Build CapAcity

Establish two new Sumatran rhino sanctuaries in Indonesia, one in Indonesian
Borneo and the other in northern Sumatra, and expand the existing facility in
Way Kambas National Park.

Search and Rescue

Find as many rhinos as possible living in small, isolated populations in
Indonesia and relocate them to managed conservation breeding facilities
nearby.

Protect and Breed

Incorporate the rhinos into a single conservation breeding program that uses
state-of-the-art veterinary and husbandry care to maximize population growth.

You Can Help Save the Rhinos

   Together, we can secure a future for Sumatran rhinos and threatened
   species all over the world.

The Goal: Protect 20 of the Ocean's Wildest Places by 2020

   The ocean. It covers 70 percent of the planet and shelters an
   incredible diversity of life. It gives us food, jobs, and more than
   half the oxygen we breathe. We swim and sail it, travel to be near it,
   and learn from it.

   But we’re taking too many fish out of the ocean, polluting it, and
   making it warmer and more acidic. Yet less than eight percent of it is
   protected.

   National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala launched the
   Pristine Seas project in 2008 to explore and help save the last wild
   places in the ocean. These unique ecosystems are a window into the
   past, revealing what the ocean looked like before overfishing and
   pollution took their toll. It is essential that we let the world know
   that these places exist, that they are threatened, and that help is
   needed to protect them. Read more.
