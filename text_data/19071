   Iceland prides itself with spectacular and unusual landscapes that seem
   from another planet. It also prides with being the best country in the
   world in terms of gender equality. No wonder this is the place where I
   found Andrea, who is an adventure guide. I photographed her together
   with her son, Benjamin, last month.
   This strong and brave Icelandic woman takes adventurous tourists on the
   amazing glaciers of her country. It’s a risky job, with lots of
   responsibilities. More than that, Andrea is a single mother, so each
   step on the glaciers means even more responsibilities.
   But when you do what you love, when the society encourages you to be
   who you want to be, the sky is the limit. And Iceland has such a unique
   sky.

   Reka is a leukemia survivor. I photographed her on the Széchenyi Chain
   Bridge in Budapest, Hungary, in May. As this majestic bridge was
   brought back to life after being blown up during the Second World War,
   Reka, helped by the doctors, survived cancer.

   Two years ago, while under chemotherapy she started to document her
   experience through powerful self-portraits. She wanted to show that a
   bald woman, struggling for her life, can still be strong and beautiful.
   She started to post her meaningful series on social media, to give
   courage and hope to other people in similar situations. How many of us
   could have such strength in such a moment?

   Brave Reka beat leukemia and today she continues her work, inspiring
   and empowering those suffering of cancer. She is photographing cancer
   survivors, sharing their stories on social media. Dear Reka, may your
   courage and positivity save as many lives as possible.

   Today my daughter Natalia turns one year. And what a year…

   We’ve visited 10 countries with The Atlas of Beauty, we’ve cried, we’ve
   smiled and, most importantly, we grew up healthily.

   Being a mother is immensely challenging. And being a mother, while also
   traveling and working, is even more challenging. Natalia is breastfed
   and she always wants me next to her. She constantly wakes up during the
   night and I haven’t had any decent sleep in the past 12 months. She
   doesn’t stay more than 20 minutes in a stroller, because she loves
   being in my arms, and she’s heavier and heavier. Like any baby, she
   needs better travel conditions than an adult, so more struggles to
   raise funds for traveling.

   So why doing all the effort? Why becoming a mother, and more than that,
   why also continuing a challenging work after giving birth?

   Because all these days, with all the challenges, are the most beautiful
   days I ever had. Because all the difficulties are instantly forgotten
   when she smiles to me. Because while working, I can offer her a chance
   to discover the world and its people. Because I have an amazing husband
   who now travels with me and shares the responsibility, the effort, the
   happiness of raising a child.

   Happy Birthday, Natalia! May the world offer you the most precious
   gifts. May the people we encounter inspire you to be a beautiful human
   being.

   I stepped for the very first time into a tablao in March, in Barcelona.
   Wow, what a fascinating world. A tablao is a place where flamenco shows
   are performed and, believe me, it’s such an awesome experience to see
   the passion, the power, the charisma of great flamenco artists.

   One of the dancers I encountered in this tablao was Gema. I
   photographed her just a few meters away from the venue, because there I
   discovered this splendid panorama of Barcelona.

   Flamenco wasn’t born here, but this region gave some of the best
   dancers. Originally from Andalusia, in Southern Spain, Flamenco has
   been influenced by and associated with the Romani people in Spain.

   Gema herself comes from a Romani family which has strong ties with this
   astonishing art. Gema’s great-grandaunt, Carmen Amaya, was one of the
   greatest flamenco dancers of all time. Some say Carmen was the first
   female to truly master the flamenco footwork, previously reserved for
   the best male dancers, due to its speed and intensity. She used to be
   called a human tornado. Now, almost a century later, her
   great-grandniece continues the tradition.

   Hajnalka is a nurse and she has seen them all in the hospital where she
   works. But she chose to stay on the bright side of life, expressing
   that every day through her style.
   “I believe in unicorns” she told me. In that rainy day a few dozens of
   them were flying on her jacket.

   After I photographed her in January on the streets of Dublin, Ireland,
   she recited one of her poems. Wow, you can’t imagine how amazing she
   is.
   Natalya is the kind of poet who’s art is also about reciting her
   poetry. She’s a spoken word artist who combines boldness and
   sensitivity in an astonishing way. “I can be soft and strong in the
   same breath” says one of her lines.
   Please take a minute and read one of Natalya’s brilliant poems, called
   “Not like other girls”. It’s her story, but also the story of so many
   of us:
   ——————————
   “I never liked pink or glitter or bows. Instead I chose blue and dirt
   and diggin’.
   Never liked lipsticks or perfume, never hung horse-themed posters in my
   bedroom,
   assumed I was not like the other girls, and the other girls were not
   like me.
   I shied away from my femininity, maximised my masculinity
   so that the boys wouldn’t pick me last in team chasing.
   I’d sooner fall in the muck than be stuck sittin’ with the girls,
   all swappin’ stories of the glories of kissing boys. It was all just
   noise to me.
   I didn’t see why I was different but I knew I was.
   I didn’t abide by the agreed upon girl code laws.
   I didn’t want to be girly or soft or weak.
   I didn’t want to be considered delicate or meek ‘cause that’s what
   girls are
   – or so I was told.
   Society had pitted me against myself.
   I denied my own identity to embody what was said to be for the boys,
   but now I know I’m not like other girls.
   I can be soft and strong in the same breath
   I can like shoes and makeup and still have depth.
   I can be brave while wiping tears on my sleeve.
   I can be everything or nothing I’m expected to be.
   I can be like the other girls and they can be like me.”

   Two soulmates and a heartwarming story.
   I met Marina and Elena on the streets of Valencia, Spain in March. The
   two young Spanish live in Alicante and were traveling here.
   Marina and Elena told me that people usually believe that they are
   sisters. And in a way, that’s true. Since they met in their university,
   a few years ago, they are almost always together and like to call
   themselves soulmates.
   They love to go to dance classes together, to do slalom and to
   volunteer in children hospitals doing different activities with the
   little ones. Both spent much of their childhood in hospitals
   and they know how important is to have support when you need it most.
   I felt so much love, kindness and generosity coming from these amazing
   women while talking to them. And to me these are synonyms of
   beauty…Multiplied by two.

   Scarlett is German and manages a beautiful tattoo studio in the Gràcia
   district of Barcelona. While walking on the small alleys of this
   charming neighbourhood, a few weeks ago, I noticed her inside the
   parlour. Her life seemed perfect in this chic place, doing what she
   loves, in a gorgeous city, but I found out that things were not always
   like that.

   She made her first tattoo many years ago, when she was living in
   Germany, to honour the memory of her best friend who died in a car
   accident. That moment changed her life. If she wasn’t able to save her
   friend, she must save other people, she told herself. And she did that
   in the following years by becoming a paramedic.

   She have seen them all with her work. One of the most tragic moments
   she has witnessed as a paramedic was in 2010, during a music festival
   in Duisburg, Germany. 21 people died of suffocation and 500 were
   injured because of the panic caused by the overcrowding. The paramedics
   were outnumbered by the size of the tragedy and Scarlett remembers the
   terrible moment when she had to look around and choose who needs her
   support first.

   Another experience that remains fresh in her memory is the Syrian war.
   She worked in Aleppo witnessing the terrible consequences of armed
   conflicts. What gave her strength in all those years was the fact that
   she was saving lives.

   For those who have tattoos, each of them comes with a different story,
   representing usually a different chapter of life. In a way, Scarlett’s
   skin is the mirror of her intense life, a memoir written with ink and
   needles.

   When I met her she was on the way to a patient who is an auto mechanic.

   I walked in the morning on the streets of Oslo, the capital of the
   country, admiring the thousands of bunads all around me. Some were new,
   but others were inherited from grandmothers and great-grandmothers.
   Julie didn’t use to wear the bunad before, but a few years ago, during
   a cold and snowy National Day, she decided to give it a try. She felt
   so warm and beautiful while wearing it that she decided to wear it
   every year.

   Lyndsay studies Environmental Studies at the Trinity College in Dublin,
   Ireland. The library of the college is one of the most impressive in
   the world and that’s where I photographed her a few months ago.
   While visiting this extraordinary place I found myself surrounded by
   sculptures of great philosophers, writers, and other personalities. But
   what I noticed was that all these busts inside the library depicted
   men.
   For hundreds of years women had less opportunities than men in the
   academic field. Although there’s still much inequality around the
   world, things are changing. People like Lyndsay -who recently won a
   prestigious global award in the Earth & Environmental Science category-
   are changing the old norm.
   A former provost of this prestigious college once said: “Over my dead
   body will women enter this college.” Today 60% of students here are
   women.

   I noticed this young Portuguese in February on the alleys of the
   picturesque Feira da Ladra, Lisbon’s biggest flea market. Surrounded by
   antiques, we talked about memories.

   Angela lost her father when she was a small child. He was a drug addict
   and committed suicide after a terrible suffering. Today Angela studies
   psychology and works with young people who face similar problems as her
   father. After many years, she’s trying to understand what he’s been
   through in those painful moments. I asked her to describe herself in
   one word and she said resilience. And indeed, Angela is courageous and
   resilient because she overcame all the suffering and now has the
   strength to look back, saving others from the same tragic end.

   Iceland prides itself with spectacular and unusual landscapes that seem
   from another planet. It also prides with being the best country in the
   world in terms of gender equality. No wonder this is the place where I
   found Andrea, who is an adventure guide. I photographed her together
   with her son, Benjamin, last month.
   This strong and brave Icelandic woman takes adventurous tourists on the
   amazing glaciers of her country. It’s a risky job, with lots of
   responsibilities. More than that, Andrea is a single mother, so each
   step on the glaciers means even more responsibilities.
   But when you do what you love, when the society encourages you to be
   who you want to be, the sky is the limit. And Iceland has such a unique
   sky.

   Reka is a leukemia survivor. I photographed her on the Széchenyi Chain
   Bridge in Budapest, Hungary, in May. As this majestic bridge was
   brought back to life after being blown up during the Second World War,
   Reka, helped by the doctors, survived cancer.

   Two years ago, while under chemotherapy she started to document her
   experience through powerful self-portraits. She wanted to show that a
   bald woman, struggling for her life, can still be strong and beautiful.
   She started to post her meaningful series on social media, to give
   courage and hope to other people in similar situations. How many of us
   could have such strength in such a moment?

   Brave Reka beat leukemia and today she continues her work, inspiring
   and empowering those suffering of cancer. She is photographing cancer
   survivors, sharing their stories on social media. Dear Reka, may your
   courage and positivity save as many lives as possible.

   Today my daughter Natalia turns one year. And what a year…

   We’ve visited 10 countries with The Atlas of Beauty, we’ve cried, we’ve
   smiled and, most importantly, we grew up healthily.

   Being a mother is immensely challenging. And being a mother, while also
   traveling and working, is even more challenging. Natalia is breastfed
   and she always wants me next to her. She constantly wakes up during the
   night and I haven’t had any decent sleep in the past 12 months. She
   doesn’t stay more than 20 minutes in a stroller, because she loves
   being in my arms, and she’s heavier and heavier. Like any baby, she
   needs better travel conditions than an adult, so more struggles to
   raise funds for traveling.

   So why doing all the effort? Why becoming a mother, and more than that,
   why also continuing a challenging work after giving birth?

   Because all these days, with all the challenges, are the most beautiful
   days I ever had. Because all the difficulties are instantly forgotten
   when she smiles to me. Because while working, I can offer her a chance
   to discover the world and its people. Because I have an amazing husband
   who now travels with me and shares the responsibility, the effort, the
   happiness of raising a child.

   Happy Birthday, Natalia! May the world offer you the most precious
   gifts. May the people we encounter inspire you to be a beautiful human
   being.

   I stepped for the very first time into a tablao in March, in Barcelona.
   Wow, what a fascinating world. A tablao is a place where flamenco shows
   are performed and, believe me, it’s such an awesome experience to see
   the passion, the power, the charisma of great flamenco artists.

   One of the dancers I encountered in this tablao was Gema. I
   photographed her just a few meters away from the venue, because there I
   discovered this splendid panorama of Barcelona.

   Flamenco wasn’t born here, but this region gave some of the best
   dancers. Originally from Andalusia, in Southern Spain, Flamenco has
   been influenced by and associated with the Romani people in Spain.

   Gema herself comes from a Romani family which has strong ties with this
   astonishing art. Gema’s great-grandaunt, Carmen Amaya, was one of the
   greatest flamenco dancers of all time. Some say Carmen was the first
   female to truly master the flamenco footwork, previously reserved for
   the best male dancers, due to its speed and intensity. She used to be
   called a human tornado. Now, almost a century later, her
   great-grandniece continues the tradition.

   Hajnalka is a nurse and she has seen them all in the hospital where she

   that every day through her style.
   “I believe in unicorns” she told me. In that rainy day a few dozens of

   After I photographed her in January on the streets of Dublin, Ireland,
   she recited one of her poems. Wow, you can’t imagine how amazing she
   is.
   Natalya is the kind of poet who’s art is also about reciting her
   poetry. She’s a spoken word artist who combines boldness and
   sensitivity in an astonishing way. “I can be soft and strong in the
   same breath” says one of her lines.
   Please take a minute and read one of Natalya’s brilliant poems, called
   “Not like other girls”. It’s her story, but also the story of so many
   of us:
   ——————————
   “I never liked pink or glitter or bows. Instead I chose blue and dirt
   and diggin’.
   Never liked lipsticks or perfume, never hung horse-themed posters in my
   bedroom,
   assumed I was not like the other girls, and the other girls were not
   like me.
   I shied away from my femininity, maximised my masculinity
   so that the boys wouldn’t pick me last in team chasing.
   I’d sooner fall in the muck than be stuck sittin’ with the girls,
   all swappin’ stories of the glories of kissing boys. It was all just
   noise to me.
   I didn’t see why I was different but I knew I was.
   I didn’t abide by the agreed upon girl code laws.
   I didn’t want to be girly or soft or weak.
   I didn’t want to be considered delicate or meek ‘cause that’s what
   girls are
   – or so I was told.
   Society had pitted me against myself.
   I denied my own identity to embody what was said to be for the boys,
   but now I know I’m not like other girls.
   I can be soft and strong in the same breath
   I can like shoes and makeup and still have depth.
   I can be brave while wiping tears on my sleeve.
   I can be everything or nothing I’m expected to be.
   I can be like the other girls and they can be like me.”

   Two soulmates and a heartwarming story.
   I met Marina and Elena on the streets of Valencia, Spain in March. The
   two young Spanish live in Alicante and were traveling here.
   Marina and Elena told me that people usually believe that they are
   sisters. And in a way, that’s true. Since they met in their university,
   a few years ago, they are almost always together and like to call
   themselves soulmates.
   They love to go to dance classes together, to do slalom and to
   volunteer in children hospitals doing different activities with the
   little ones. Both spent much of their childhood in hospitals
   and they know how important is to have support when you need it most.
   I felt so much love, kindness and generosity coming from these amazing
   women while talking to them. And to me these are synonyms of
   beauty…Multiplied by two.

   Scarlett is German and manages a beautiful tattoo studio in the Gràcia
   district of Barcelona. While walking on the small alleys of this
   charming neighbourhood, a few weeks ago, I noticed her inside the
   parlour. Her life seemed perfect in this chic place, doing what she
   loves, in a gorgeous city, but I found out that things were not always
   like that.

   She made her first tattoo many years ago, when she was living in
   Germany, to honour the memory of her best friend who died in a car
   accident. That moment changed her life. If she wasn’t able to save her
   friend, she must save other people, she told herself. And she did that
   in the following years by becoming a paramedic.

   She have seen them all with her work. One of the most tragic moments
   she has witnessed as a paramedic was in 2010, during a music festival
   in Duisburg, Germany. 21 people died of suffocation and 500 were
   injured because of the panic caused by the overcrowding. The paramedics
   were outnumbered by the size of the tragedy and Scarlett remembers the
   terrible moment when she had to look around and choose who needs her
   support first.

   Another experience that remains fresh in her memory is the Syrian war.
   She worked in Aleppo witnessing the terrible consequences of armed
   conflicts. What gave her strength in all those years was the fact that
   she was saving lives.

   For those who have tattoos, each of them comes with a different story,
   representing usually a different chapter of life. In a way, Scarlett’s
   skin is the mirror of her intense life, a memoir written with ink and
   needles.

   When I met her she was on the way to a patient who is an auto mechanic.

   Norwegians wear the bunad, a sophisticated folk costume.
   I walked in the morning on the streets of Oslo, the capital of the
   country, admiring the thousands of bunads all around me. Some were new,
   but others were inherited from grandmothers and great-grandmothers.
   Julie didn’t use to wear the bunad before, but a few years ago, during
   a cold and snowy National Day, she decided to give it a try. She felt
   so warm and beautiful while wearing it that she decided to wear it
   every year.

   Lyndsay studies Environmental Studies at the Trinity College in Dublin,
   Ireland. The library of the college is one of the most impressive in
   the world and that’s where I photographed her a few months ago.
   While visiting this extraordinary place I found myself surrounded by
   sculptures of great philosophers, writers, and other personalities. But
   what I noticed was that all these busts inside the library depicted
   men.
   For hundreds of years women had less opportunities than men in the
   academic field. Although there’s still much inequality around the
   world, things are changing. People like Lyndsay -who recently won a
   prestigious global award in the Earth & Environmental Science category-
   are changing the old norm.
   A former provost of this prestigious college once said: “Over my dead
   body will women enter this college.” Today 60% of students here are
   women.

   I noticed this young Portuguese in February on the alleys of the
   picturesque Feira da Ladra, Lisbon’s biggest flea market. Surrounded by
   antiques, we talked about memories.

   Angela lost her father when she was a small child. He was a drug addict
   and committed suicide after a terrible suffering. Today Angela studies
   psychology and works with young people who face similar problems as her
   father. After many years, she’s trying to understand what he’s been
   through in those painful moments. I asked her to describe herself in
   one word and she said resilience. And indeed, Angela is courageous and
   resilient because she overcame all the suffering and now has the
   strength to look back, saving others from the same tragic end.

   Iceland prides itself with spectacular and unusual landscapes that seem
   from another planet. It also prides with being the best country in the
   world in terms of gender equality. No wonder this is the place where I
   found Andrea, who is an adventure guide. I photographed her together
   with her son, Benjamin, last month.
   This strong and brave Icelandic woman takes adventurous tourists on the
   amazing glaciers of her country. It’s a risky job, with lots of
   responsibilities. More than that, Andrea is a single mother, so each
   step on the glaciers means even more responsibilities.
   But when you do what you love, when the society encourages you to be
   who you want to be, the sky is the limit. And Iceland has such a unique
   sky.

   Reka is a leukemia survivor. I photographed her on the Széchenyi Chain
   Bridge in Budapest, Hungary, in May. As this majestic bridge was
   brought back to life after being blown up during the Second World War,
   Reka, helped by the doctors, survived cancer.

   Two years ago, while under chemotherapy she started to document her
   experience through powerful self-portraits. She wanted to show that a
   bald woman, struggling for her life, can still be strong and beautiful.
   She started to post her meaningful series on social media, to give
   courage and hope to other people in similar situations. How many of us
   could have such strength in such a moment?

   Brave Reka beat leukemia and today she continues her work, inspiring
   and empowering those suffering of cancer. She is photographing cancer
   survivors, sharing their stories on social media. Dear Reka, may your
   courage and positivity save as many lives as possible.

   She’s Sigríður, a few days ago, on the streets of Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Last week I left this cold and splendid country which gave me the
   chance to meet amazing women with fascinating names.

   I’m now in Toronto, Canada. There is where my journey to the Americas
   begins. It’s my daughter’s first trip outside Europe, and I, myself,
   feel like I’m for the very first time here. New York City, Chicago, New
   Orleans, Texas and then Latin America, be ready, we’re coming!
