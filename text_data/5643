                     PIA00379: Volcanic Eruptions on Io
                                [spacer.gif]

   This dramatic view of Jupiter's satellite Io shows two simultaneously
   occurring volcanic eruptions, as seenby NASA's Voyager 1 on March 8,
   1979, looking back 2.6 million miles (4.5 million kilometers) at Io,
   three days after its historic encounter.

   Original Caption Released with Image:
          This dramatic view of Jupiter's satellite Io shows two
          simultaneously occurring volcanic eruptions. One can be seen on
          the limb, (at lower right) in which ash clouds are rising more
          than 150 miles (260 kilometers) above the satellite's surface.
          The second can be seen on the terminator (shadow between day and
          night) where the volcanic cloud is catching the rays of the
          rising sun. The dark hemisphere of Io is made visible by light
          reflected from Jupiter. Seen in Io's night sky, Jupiter looms
          almost 40 times larger and 200 times brighter than our own full
          Moon. This photo was taken by Voyager 1 on March 8, 1979,
          looking back 2.6 million miles (4.5 million kilometers) at Io,
          three days after its historic encounter. This is the same image
          in which Linda A. Morabito, a JPL engineer, discovered the first
          extraterrestrial volcanic eruption (the bright curved volcanic
          cloud on the limb). Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages and
          controls the Voyager project for NASA's Office of Space Science.
