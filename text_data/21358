Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics

   [Reed_IPAM-Building-07-303x216.jpg]

     IPAM fosters the interaction of mathematics with a broad range of
     science and technology, builds new interdisciplinary research
     communities, promotes mathematical innovation, and engages and
     transforms the world through mathematics.

   IPAM fulfills its mission through workshops and other programs that
   connect mathematics and other disciplines or multiple areas of
   mathematics. These activities bring in thousands of visitors annually
   from academia, government and industry. As an NSF Mathematical Sciences
   Institute, IPAM serves the international scientific community. IPAM
   also engages the local community through its public lecture series.

From our Participants

   “

   [RIPS] truly kicked off my career in applied mathematics! I am
   currently applying to grad schools for applied mathematics, which I
   probably wouldn’t have done without IPAM. My participation in the RIPS
   program led to an internship at JPL which turned into a full-time
   position as a software engineer.
   ”
   Rachel Hodos,

   2008 RIPS student, now a PhD student at the Courant Institute.

About IPAM

   284-IPAM 10th Anniversary IPAM was founded in 2000 by Mark Green, Tony
   Chan, and Eitan Tadmor as an NSF Mathematical Sciences Institute with a
   grant from the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences.   Over 2,000
   visitors per year attend its workshops, long programs, student research
   programs, summer schools, and other programs.

   IPAM seeks to bring the full range of mathematical techniques to bear
   on the great scientific challenges of our time.  We sponsor programs
   that bring together researchers from different disciplines or from
   different areas of mathematics, with the goal of sparking
   interdisciplinary collaboration that continues long after the IPAM
   program ends.

   IPAM is located in the heart of the UCLA campus, adjacent to the
   Mathematical Sciences Building and directly across from Moore Hall. Its
   building was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank
   Gehry. It boasts an open and spacious design with large windows that
   flood the interior with light. The building offers plenty of office
   space for visiting scholars, a lecture hall, several other meeting
   rooms, and public areas equipped with whiteboards, ideal for group
   discussions and informal learning.

   Supporting the careers of women and minority mathematicians and
   scientists is an important component of IPAM’s mission. Read about
   IPAM’s diversity efforts.
