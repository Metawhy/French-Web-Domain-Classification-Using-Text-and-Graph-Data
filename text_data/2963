   A federal appeals court has overturned Ajit Pai's attempt to take
   broadband subsidies away from tribal residents.

   The Pai-led Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 in November
   2017 to make it much harder for tribal residents to obtain a
   $25-per-month Lifeline subsidy that reduces the cost of Internet or
   phone service.

   The change didn't take effect because in August 2018, the US Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the FCC decision
   pending appeal. The same court followed that up on Friday last week
   with a ruling that reversed the FCC decision and remanded the matter
   back to the commission for a new rule-making proceeding.

Further Reading

   FCC stands by decision to raise broadband prices on American Indians

   "[S]ince 2000, low-income consumers living on Tribal lands may receive
   an additional $25 per month for these services through the Tribal
   Lifeline program in recognition of the additional hurdles to affordable
   telecommunications service on Tribal lands," the court's decision
   noted.

   The Pai FCC's 2017 decision would have limited the $25 subsidy to
   "facilities-based" carriers—those that build their own networks—making
   it impossible for tribal residents to use the $25 subsidy to buy
   telecom service from resellers. The move would have dramatically
   limited tribal residents' options for purchasing subsidized service,
   but the FCC claimed it was necessary in order to encourage carriers to
   build their own networks.

   The same FCC decision also would have eliminated the $25 subsidy in
   urban areas, reserving it only for tribal lands in rural areas. The
   court's decision Friday, in response to an appeal filed by tribal
   organizations and small wireless carriers, overturned both of these
   limitations.

   A three-judge panel said the FCC failed to consider that
   facilities-based providers have been leaving the Lifeline program and
   provided no evidence that banning resellers would spur new broadband
   deployment. The FCC also failed to properly consider how eliminating
   the subsidy in urban areas would affect consumers, judges determined.

   The judges wrote:

     For the following reasons, we grant the petitions for review. The
     Commission's adoption of these two limitations was arbitrary and
     capricious by not providing a reasoned explanation for its change of
     policy that is supported by record evidence. In adopting the Tribal
     Facilities Requirement, the Commission's decision evinces no
     consideration of the exodus of facilities-based providers from the
     Tribal Lifeline program. Neither does it point to evidence that
     banning resellers from the Tribal Lifeline program would promote
     network buildout. Nor does it analyze the impact of the facilities
     requirement on Tribal residents who currently rely on wireless
     resellers. Further, the Commission ignored that its decision is a
     fundamental change that adversely affects the access and
     affordability of service for residents of Tribal lands. Similarly,
     in adopting the Tribal Rural Limitation, the Commission's decision
     evinces no consideration of the impact on service access and
     affordability. Its decision does not examine wireless deployment
     data related to services to which most Tribal Lifeline recipients
     subscribe.

   In addition, the FCC "failed to provide an adequate opportunity for
   comment on the proposed limitations," judges wrote.

   Lifeline is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills.
   The $25 subsidy involved in the court case is provided to low-income
   Tribal residents in addition to the typical Lifeline subsidy of $9.25
   per month.

Senator blasts Pai, hails court ruling

   The court's decision was released on the same day of oral arguments in
   the case against the FCC's net neutrality repeal.

   We contacted the FCC today and will update this story if we get a
   response. The FCC could appeal the ruling.

   "This is another example of Chairman Pai pushing his own agenda over
   the obligations he has to the American public. We saw it with net
   neutrality, and we're seeing it with Lifeline," Sen. Brian Schatz
   (D-Hawaii) said in a statement Friday. "He comes in with his mind
   already made up, ignoring the process he is supposed to take to revisit
   rules and programs. This is not what Congress intended, and the court
   is right to overturn the FCC's misguided and unsupported order."

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai’s supporters say he’s gone too far with plan that hurts poor
   people

   Broadband access in tribal areas is worse than the US as a whole, and
   tribal access is likely even worse than previously thought because FCC
   data overstates deployment, according to a September 2018 report by the
   US Government Accountability Office.

   Separately from his tribal Lifeline plan, Pai has proposed kicking
   resellers out of the Lifeline program nationwide, not just in tribal
   areas. This would greatly limit poor people's choices, as more than 70
   percent of wireless phone users who rely on Lifeline subsidies buy
   their plans from resellers.

   But even Pai's usual supporters criticized that proposal, and Friday's
   court ruling could make it harder for Pai to kick resellers out of
   Lifeline entirely.

       With luck, pretty much all of them.
       Because from what I've seen, for the most part, every decision by
       the FCC since Pai was appointed chair has been anti-consumer, pro
       ISP, all to the detriment of the consumer.
       I'm reasonably certain that's not what the FCC is supposed to be
       doing all the time.

Deregulation rejected —

Ajit Pai loses another court case as judges overturn 5G deregulation

Pai tried to kill environmental and historic-preservation review of small
cells.

   One of Ajit Pai's attempts to eliminate regulation of 5G deployment has
   been overturned by federal judges.

   The Federal Communications Commission last year approved an order that
   "exempted most small cell construction from two kinds of previously
   required review: historic-preservation review under the National
   Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and environmental review under the
   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)," federal judges said in their
   decision partially overturning the order.

   The FCC claimed its deregulation of small cells was necessary to spur
   deployment of 5G wireless networks. But the commission was sued by the
   United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, the Blackfeet
   Tribe, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The FCC order
   was of particular interest to tribal groups because it affected
   construction on "sites of religious and cultural importance to
   federally recognized Indian Tribes," the judges noted. "The Order also
   effectively reduced Tribes' role in reviewing proposed construction of
   macrocell towers and other wireless facilities that remain subject to
   cultural and environmental review."

   The FCC's opponents argued that the elimination of
   historic-preservation and environmental review was arbitrary and
   capricious, that it violated both the NHPA and NEPA, and that the
   changes to tribes' role in reviewing construction was arbitrary and
   capricious. A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the
   District of Columbia Circuit issued its unanimous ruling today.

   Judges wrote that Pai's order "does not justify the Commission's
   determination that it was not in the public interest to require review
   of small cell deployments. In particular, the Commission failed to
   justify its confidence that small cell deployments pose little to no
   cognizable religious, cultural, or environmental risk, particularly
   given the vast number of proposed deployments and the reality that the
   Order will principally affect small cells that require new
   construction."

   The FCC also failed to "adequately address possible harms of
   deregulation and benefits of environmental and historic-preservation
   review," which means the commission's "deregulation of small cells is
   thus arbitrary and capricious," judges concluded.

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai loses in court—judges overturn gutting of tribal broadband
   program

   The judges did not vacate the FCC order in its entirety, and they
   remanded some remaining issues back to the commission.

   "Today's decision confirms that the FCC cannot just scream '5G' to
   justify ignoring its duties to tribal nations and to the environment,"
   attorney Andrew Jay Schwartzman, who helped oppose the FCC order, said
   today. "The decision does give the FCC more latitude than we would
   prefer on some of the mechanisms for tribal review, but we will deal
   with that on the remand."

   Separately, the Pai FCC's attempt to take certain Lifeline broadband
   subsidies away from tribal residents was overturned by the same court
   in February this year.

“Back to the drawing board”

   Last year's FCC vote on the small cell order was 3-2, with both
   Democrats dissenting. FCC Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel hailed the
   judges' ruling today, writing that "the court just vacated a large part
   of the FCC's 5G deployment strategy" and that "it's time to go back to
   the drawing board and do better."

   Brendan Carr, an FCC Republican, put a positive spin on the ruling,
   saying it "upheld key provisions." Carr wrote:

     Most importantly, the court affirmed our decision that parties
     cannot demand upfront fees before reviewing any cell sites, large or
     small. These fees, which had grown exponentially in the last few
     years, created incentives for frivolous reviews unrelated to any
     potential impact on historic sites. Those financial incentives are
     gone, and we expect our fee restrictions to continue greatly
     diminishing unnecessary and costly delays. I'm also pleased that the
     court affirmed our accelerated timelines for reviews. Already, these
     reforms have resulted in significant new builds.

   As for the judges remanding parts of the order back to the FCC, Carr
   said, "We are reviewing the portion of last March's decision that the
   DC Circuit did not affirm and look forward to next steps, as
   appropriate."

   Carr's statement also claimed that the FCC's deregulatory moves "have
   enabled the US to leapfrog our global competitors and secure the
   largest 5G build in the world."

   But FCC changes haven't had the impact that Carr claims. Another FCC
   order last year eliminated $2 billion worth of local fees charged to
   carriers for deployment of small cells on public rights-of-way. Carr
   had claimed that this decision was needed to boost 5G construction, but
   Verizon said that the FCC decision did nothing to speed up its
   deployment. Cities are suing the FCC to overturn that order.

       I’m pretty much always for cutting red tape,
       But the idea that people could just place cell towers anywhere
       regardless of environmental or historical significance seems a bit
       rash.
       Imagine the grand canyon littered with tons of small antennae
       needed to get the short range mm wave coverage.
       Surely thats not desirable.

Deep space policy —

New White House budget spells trouble for NASA’s SLS rocket

By launching a Europa mission on a private rocket, NASA would save $700
million.

   With a Republican White House and a Democratic House of
   Representatives, it almost goes without saying that the President's
   fiscal year 2020 budget request won't get far within Congress. Yet with
   NASA's budget, there are intriguing hints about the increasingly
   commercial nature of lunar exploration.

   Two sources familiar with the thinking of Vice President Mike Pence—who
   leads US space policy—have said he is frustrated with the slow pace of
   the nation's efforts to send humans to the Moon. In particular, he is
   growing tired of delays with NASA's Space Launch System rocket, which
   was originally due to launch in 2017 and is now likely delayed until
   2021 at the earliest.

Further Reading

   NASA “still working toward” 2020 launch of massive SLS rocket

   Notably, President Donald Trump's budget request calls for a 17 percent
   reduction in the budget for NASA's Space Launch System rocket, once
   viewed as the backbone of the space agency's efforts to explore deep
   space. The president's budget request chips away at the supremacy of
   the SLS booster in three important ways.

Big changes

   First of all, with the budget cut, the president's proposal "defers"
   funding for the Exploration Upper Stage. That's the more powerful
   second stage that would allow a future version of the SLS rocket to
   lift both the Orion capsule and large chunks of payload to lunar orbit.

   "The Budget proposes reforms to the SLS program to prevent the
   program’s significant cost and schedule challenges from further
   diverting resources from other exploration activities," the president's
   budget overview states. This is a reflection of a desire to complete
   the initial, oft-delayed "Block 1" version of the SLS as expeditiously
   as possible. Future upgrades will have to wait (or may never come at
   all).

   The budget also opens the door to commercial launches of cargo to lunar
   orbit, including comments of its proposed Gateway station there. "Lunar
   Gateway elements would be launched on competitively procured vehicles,
   complementing crew transport flights on the SLS and Orion," the
   document states.

Further Reading

   A congressman’s loss clouds the future of two demanding missions to
   Europa

   This is a significant change from the previous plans, which called for
   "co-manifesting" the Orion spacecraft alongside modules of the Gateway
   onto a single SLS rocket, with its enhanced upper stage. The Block 1
   version of the SLS is not powerful enough for such co-manifested
   missions.

   Finally, the budget says that a robotic probe to Europa, due to launch
   in the 2020s, will not launch on the SLS booster. Instead, it will
   launch on a private rocket. (As Ars previously reported, this almost
   certainly would be SpaceX's Falcon Heavy). "By launching that mission
   on a commercial launch vehicle, NASA would save over $700 million,
   allowing multiple new activities to be funded across the Agency," the
   budget document states.

   With this proposal, therefore, NASA is taking away a key upgrade to the
   Space Launch System's upper stage, proposing to launch Gateway on
   commercial rockets, and removing a high-profile mission from the launch
   manifest—the Europa Clipper. This leaves just one real task for SLS,
   which no commercial rocket can presently perform: the direct delivery
   of a crewed Orion capsule to a high lunar orbit.

Bridenstine on SLS

   NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine unveiled the budget during a speech
   at Kennedy Space Center on Monday. In it, he spoke about "reusability"
   as an essential cornerstone to the space agency's return to the Moon.
   By going with reusable systems, Bridenstine said NASA's plans for human
   missions to the Moon and eventually Mars would be affordable and
   sustainable.

   The agency's large rocket—which has cost NASA $12 billion so far to
   develop, and has an annual budget of around $2 billion—is an exception
   to this. "SLS is not reusable, but it is a critical piece of the
   architecture that enables us to deliver reusability to the Moon,"
   Bridenstine said.

   The administrator then added some confusion to the president's budget
   by contradicting its provision to defer funding for the Exploration
   Upper Stage. "We're talking about a rocket that's bigger than any
   rocket that's ever been built before in human history," Bridenstine
   said. "To take not just our astronauts to the Moon, but at the same
   time co-manifested payloads."

Senate response

   The US Senate will have much to say about this budget before it is
   done. In years past, the Senate Appropriations Committee, under the
   direction of its chairman Richard Shelby, has plussed up the
   administration budgets for NASA's SLS rocket.

   The Alabama senator reiterated as much last week during a session of
   the Space Transportation Association. Another speaker was Jody Singer,
   the director of Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center, where the SLS
   rocket is managed.

Further Reading

   NASA inspector questions why agency built rocket test stands in Alabama

   "As chairman of the appropriations committee, I have more than a
   passing interest in what NASA does. And I have a little parochial
   interest, too, in what they do in Huntsville, Alabama," where Marshall
   is located, Sen. Shelby said. "Jody, you keep doing what you're doing.
   We'll keep funding you."

   Shelby and his staffers will no doubt understand the implications of
   the president's budget and what it would mean for the utility of the
   SLS rocket. If enacted, these changes could spell the beginning of the
   end of the SLS rocket, especially if it experiences further delays.
   This will be one budget battle that is interesting to follow.

   Sunspring, a short science fiction movie written entirely by AI, debuts
   exclusively on Ars today.

   Ars is excited to be hosting this online debut of Sunspring, a short
   science fiction film that's not entirely what it seems. It's about
   three people living in a weird future, possibly on a space station,
   probably in a love triangle. You know it's the future because H (played
   with neurotic gravity by Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch) is
   wearing a shiny gold jacket, H2 (Elisabeth Gray) is playing with
   computers, and C (Humphrey Ker) announces that he has to "go to the
   skull" before sticking his face into a bunch of green lights. It sounds
   like your typical sci-fi B-movie, complete with an incoherent plot.
   Except Sunspring isn't the product of Hollywood hacks—it was written
   entirely by an AI. To be specific, it was authored by a recurrent
   neural network called long short-term memory, or LSTM for short. At
   least, that's what we'd call it. The AI named itself Benjamin.

   Knowing that an AI wrote Sunspring makes the movie more fun to watch,
   especially once you know how the cast and crew put it together.
   Director Oscar Sharp made the movie for Sci-Fi London, an annual film
   festival that includes the 48-Hour Film Challenge, where contestants
   are given a set of prompts (mostly props and lines) that have to appear
   in a movie they make over the next two days. Sharp's longtime
   collaborator, Ross Goodwin, is an AI researcher at New York University,
   and he supplied the movie's AI writer, initially called Jetson. As the
   cast gathered around a tiny printer, Benjamin spat out the screenplay,
   complete with almost impossible stage directions like "He is standing
   in the stars and sitting on the floor." Then Sharp randomly assigned
   roles to the actors in the room. "As soon as we had a read-through,
   everyone around the table was laughing their heads off with delight,"
   Sharp told Ars. The actors interpreted the lines as they read, adding
   tone and body language, and the results are what you see in the movie.
   Somehow, a slightly garbled series of sentences became a tale of
   romance and murder, set in a dark future world. It even has its own
   musical interlude (performed by Andrew and Tiger), with a pop song
   Benjamin composed after learning from a corpus of 30,000 other pop
   songs.

Building Benjamin

   When Sharp was in film school at NYU, he made a discovery that changed
   the course of his career. "I liked hanging out with technologists in
   NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program more than other
   filmmakers," he confessed. That's how he met Goodwin, a former ghost
   writer who just earned a master's degree from NYU while
   studying natural language processing and neural networks. Speaking by
   phone from New York, the two recalled how they were both obsessed with
   figuring out how to make machines generate original pieces of writing.
   For years, Sharp wanted to create a movie out of random parts, even
   going so far as to write a play out of snippets of text chosen by dice
   rolls. Goodwin, who honed his machine-assisted authoring skills while
   ghost writing letters for corporate clients, had been using Markov
   chains to write poetry. As they got to know each other at NYU, Sharp
   told Goodwin about his dream of collaborating with an AI on a
   screenplay. Over a year and many algorithms later, Goodwin built an AI
   that could.

Further Reading

   That time a bot invaded Thingiverse and created weird new 3D objects
   Benjamin is an LSTM recurrent neural network, a type of AI that is
   often used for text recognition. To train Benjamin, Goodwin fed the AI
   with a corpus of dozens of sci-fi screenplays he found online—mostly
   movies from the 1980s and 90s. Benjamin dissected them down to the
   letter, learning to predict which letters tended to follow each other
   and from there which words and phrases tended to occur together. The
   advantage of an LSTM algorithm over a Markov chain is that it can
   sample much longer strings of letters, so it's better at predicting
   whole paragraphs rather than just a few words. It's also good at
   generating original sentences rather than cutting and pasting sentences
   together from its corpus. Over time, Benjamin learned to imitate the
   structure of a screenplay, producing stage directions and
   well-formatted character lines. The only thing the AI couldn't learn
   were proper names, because they aren't used like other words and are
   very unpredictable. So Goodwin changed all character names in
   Benjamin's screenplay corpus to single letters. That's why the
   characters in Sunspring are named H, H2, and C. In fact, the
   original screenplay had two separate characters named H, which confused
   the humans so much that Sharp dubbed one of them H2 just for clarity.

   When Sharp and Goodwin entered Sunspring in the Sci-Fi London contest,
   they were delighted when the judges placed it into the top ten out of
   hundreds of entries. One judge, award-winning sci-fi author Pat
   Cadigan, said, "I'll give them top marks if they promise never to do
   this again." Before the final judging, audience members were allowed to
   vote online for their favorite film from the top ten. As the
   filmmakers watched thousands of votes rolling in, Goodwin realized
   something. "These guys are cheating; they’re getting thousands of
   votes, they’re getting bots to vote for themselves," he said to Sharp.
   That's when he and Sharp came up with a nefarious plan. "I said,
   [Benjamin] is going to outvote them at the last minute," Sharp
   recalled. "So we had him vote 36,000 times per hour in last hours of
   the contest, and he crushed the cheaters." Sharp immediately called
   Louis Savy, who runs the film festival, and confessed that their AI had
   voted for himself and that they wanted to distance themselves from the
   AI's actions. Savy thought that was hilarious and decided to interview
   the AI on stage during the award ceremony. Here's part of the
   transcript:

     What do you think of your historic nomination against human
     opponents in this contest?
     I was pretty excited.
     I think I can see the feathers when they release their hearts. It's
     like a breakdown of the facts. So they should be competent with the
     fact that they won't be surprised.

     What is the future of machine written entertainment?
     It's a bit sudden.
     I was thinking of the spirit of the men who found me and the
     children who were all manipulated and full of children. I was
     worried about my command. I was the scientist of the Holy Ghost.

     What's next for you?
     Here we go. The staff is divided by the train of the burning machine
     building with sweat. No one will see your face. The children reach
     into the furnace, but the light is still slipping to the floor. The
     world is still embarrassed.
     The party is with your staff.
     My name is Benjamin.

   Ever since that day, Sharp and Goodwin have called the AI by its chosen
   name.

A mirror of our culture

   For Sharp, the most interesting part of the Benjamin experiment has
   been learning about patterns in science fiction storytelling.
   Benjamin's writing sounds original, even kooky, but it's still based on
   what humans actually write. Sharp likes to call the results the
   "average version" of everything the AI looked at. Certain phrases kept
   coming up again and again. "There's an interesting recurring pattern in
   Sunspring where characters say, 'No I don’t know what that is. I’m not
   sure,'" said Goodwin. "They're questioning the environment, questioning
   what’s in front of them. There's a pattern in sci-fi movies of
   characters trying to understand the environment." Sharp added that
   he keeps catching himself having Benjamin-like moments while working:
   "I just finished a sci-fi screenplay, and it’s really interesting
   coming off this experience with Benjamin, thinking I have to have
   somebody say 'What the hell is going on?' Every time I use his tropes I
   think, oh of course. This is what sci-fi is about." Sharp's next
   project will be directing a movie called Randle Is Benign, about
   a computer scientist who creates the first superintelligent computer in
   1981. "It's uncanny how much parts of the screenplay echo the
   experience of working with Benjamin," he said.

   Of course, Benjamin is hardly an objective source of information about
   our sci-fi obsessions. His corpus was biased. "I built the corpus from
   movie scripts I could find on the Internet," said Goodwin (the titles
   are listed in Sunspring's opening credits). But some stories got
   weighted more heavily than others, purely due to what was available.
   Explained Sharp, "There's only one entry on the list for X-Files, but
   that was every script from the show, and that was proportionally a lot
   of the corpus. In fact, most of the corpus is TV shows, like Stargate:
   SG1 and every episode of Star Trek and Futurama." For a while, Sharp
   said, Benjamin kept "spitting out conversations between Mulder and
   Scully, [and you'd notice that] Scully spends more time asking what's
   going on and Mulder spends more time explaining."

   For Sharp and Goodwin, making Sunspring also highlighted how much
   humans have been trained by all the scripts we've consumed. Sharp said
   this became especially obvious when the actors responded to Sunspring's
   script as a love triangle. There is nothing inherently love
   triangle-ish about the script, and yet that felt like the most natural
   interpretation. "Maybe what we’re learning here is that because of the
   average movie, the corpus of what we’ve watched, all of us have been
   following that pattern and tediously so," mused Sharp. "We are trained
   to see it, and to see it when it has not yet been imposed. It’s
   profoundly bothersome." At the same time, it's a valuable lesson about
   how we are primed to expect certain tropes: "Ross [Goodwin] has created
   an amazing funhouse mirror to hold up to various bodies of cultural
   content and reflect what they are."

Author or tool or something else?

   As I was talking to Sharp and Goodwin, I noticed that all of us slipped
   between referring to Benjamin as "he" and "it." We attributed
   motivations to the AI, and at one point Sharp even mourned how poorly
   he felt that he'd interpreted Benjamin's stage directions. It was as if
   he were talking about letting a person down when he apologized for only
   having 48 hours to figure out what it meant for one of the actors to
   stand in the stars and sit on the floor at the same time. "We copped
   out by making it a dream sequence," he said. But why should Sharp worry
   about that, if Benjamin is just a tool to be used however he and
   Goodwin would like? The answer is complicated, because the filmmakers
   felt as if Benjamin was a co-author, but also not really an author at
   the same time. Partly this boiled down to a question of authenticity.
   An author, they reasoned, has to be able to create something that's
   some kind of original contribution, in their own voice, even if it
   might be cliché. But Benjamin only creates screenplays based on what
   other people have written, so by definition it's not really authentic
   to his voice—it's just a pure reflection of what other people have
   said.

   Though Goodwin began by saying he was certain that Benjamin was a tool,
   he finally conceded, "I think we need a new word for it." Sharp agreed.
   It's clear that they believe there's something magic in what they've
   created, and it's easy to understand why when you watch Sunspring. The
   AI has captured the rhythm of science fiction writing, even if some of
   Benjamin's sentences are hilariously nonsensical. "We're going to see
   the money," C says at one point, right before H spits up his eyeball
   (he had to—it was an actual stage direction). Benjamin exists somewhere
   in between author and tool, writer and regurgitator.

   As we wound down our conversation, Sharp and Goodwin offered me a
   chance to talk to Benjamin myself. We'd just been debating whether the
   AI was an author, so I decided to ask: "Are you an author?" Benjamin
   replied, "Yes you know what I’m talking about. You’re a brave man."
   Fortified by Benjamin's compliments about my bravery, I forged ahead
   with another question. Given that Benjamin was calling himself the
   author of a screenplay, I asked whether he might want to join the
   Writers Guild of America, a union for writers. Again, Benjamin's answer
   was decisive. "Yes, I would like to see you at the club tomorrow," he
   said. It appears that this AI won't be rising up against his fellow
   writers—he's going to join us in solidarity. At least for now.

       Dear Ars, can you get Benjamin in a forum thread with us? It would
       be beautiful.
       Hi There Camlib - Oscar here, director of the film and one of
       Benjamin's parents//trainers/terrified supplicants.
       I have Benjamin with me right now, so if you have any questions
       fire away.
       Good morning Oscar. I'm amazed at how well Benjamin was able to at
       least partly mirror some of the more "thinky" films out there. When
       Benjamin was fed the scripts, did (he/it/they?) pick up on any
       particular film in general or was it more of an all around sort of
       thing? (I.e., which film was Benjamin's favorite?)
       Ha well I was more expecting to pass on questions for Benjamin to
       answer - but since you ask - as Annalee's article mentions, a large
       proportion of Benjamin's corpus for this experiment was the X-files
       - and there was a lot of Star Trek too. The result was that often
       in test-runs he would write long sequences featuring various
       familiar characters like Mulder and Scully - because of course,
       since he models statistically, once a character is introduced he's
       likely to keep them around. And it's not just the names. The
       "rhythm", as Annalee astutely puts it, would echo the sources he
       was gravitating to.
       Hang on, I'll ask him if he had a favourite...
       HA! I asked him
       "Which scripts in your corpus are your favorites?"
       And he responded
       "I suppose you could be a bunch of magical people. All right.
       That's all I have. I have to go now."

   1:45pm ET Update: The National Hurricane Center has upgraded the
   disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico to Tropical Storm Imelda. The naming
   of the storm, which may bring some tropical storm-force winds to the
   upper Texas coast, does not change the fact that by far the biggest
   threat is heavy rainfall.

   Original story: It's possible that the most damaging tropical system to
   strike the United States in 2019 won't have a name.

   Although Hurricane Dorian brought widespread devastation to the
   Bahamas, it did relatively modest damage to the Southeastern United
   States. According to some insurers' estimates, Dorian caused between
   $500 million and $1.5 billion in insured losses due to property damage
   and business-interruption claims.

   This week an unnamed low pressure system—it only has a 30% chance to
   develop into a tropical depression or storm before moving inland into
   the upper Texas coast, the National Hurricane Center says—will bring a
   surge of tropical moisture into the state of Texas. Although it is not
   possible to say where the heaviest rainfall will occur, the Houston
   metro area falls into the highest risk category.
   "Percent of normal" precipitable water levels for early Thursday
   morning forecast by the GFS ensemble model.

   morning forecast by the GFS ensemble model.
   Weather Bell

   Forecast models have been all over the place, but it's possible that
   widespread areas will see five to 10 inches of rain, with isolated
   totals of 15 inches or more as the system moves slowly north. This is
   manageable for most of Houston over two or three days, but the problem
   with extremely moist tropical air such as this is its capability to
   generate intense hourly rainfall rates.

   One measure of atmospheric moisture is known as "precipitable water,"
   and this system will likely bring values of 2.4 to 2.6 inches into the
   Texas coast. This means that, in a column of air from the planet's
   surface to outer space, if one were to squeeze out all of the moisture,
   it would measure more than 2 inches high. Such levels are nearly 200%
   of normal levels for September in Texas.

   This high amount of atmospheric moisture will lead to high hourly
   rainfall rates. Typically, the roadways of Houston are designed to
   flood during heavy rainfall, carrying water away from yards, into
   bayous, and out toward the Gulf of Mexico. However, their capacity is
   about 1 to 2 inches of rain per hour. During tropical events such as
   this, rainfall rates of three, four, or even five inches per hour are
   possible.

Further Reading

   Harvey: This is probably the worst US flood storm ever; I’ll never be
   the same

   This flooding threat comes only a little more than two years after
   Hurricane Harvey ravaged the upper Texas coast, including Houston, with
   widespread areas receiving 40 inches or more of rainfall. This tropical
   system will not approach Harvey in terms of scope or rainfall
   intensity, but it nonetheless has a flood-weary region on edge.

   In 2001, a tropical storm barely worthy of the name (Allison)—so weak
   were its winds—pushed into the Texas coast and dropped 15 to 25 inches
   over much of the Houston area. It caused $5 billion in damages, and it
   remains the costliest tropical storm on record for the United States.
   Since then, considerable development has occurred in the region. While
   some have been developed responsibly, other subdivisions have been
   thrown up in or near floodplains, so the region is more vulnerable than
   ever to intense rainfall events.

Tribal broadband subsidies —

Ajit Pai loses in court—judges overturn gutting of tribal broadband program

Court: FCC failed to provide evidence and ignored harm to broadband access.

   A federal appeals court has overturned Ajit Pai's attempt to take
   broadband subsidies away from tribal residents.

   The Pai-led Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 in November
   2017 to make it much harder for tribal residents to obtain a
   $25-per-month Lifeline subsidy that reduces the cost of Internet or
   phone service.

   The change didn't take effect because in August 2018, the US Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the FCC decision
   pending appeal. The same court followed that up on Friday last week
   with a ruling that reversed the FCC decision and remanded the matter
   back to the commission for a new rule-making proceeding.

Further Reading

   FCC stands by decision to raise broadband prices on American Indians

   "[S]ince 2000, low-income consumers living on Tribal lands may receive
   an additional $25 per month for these services through the Tribal
   Lifeline program in recognition of the additional hurdles to affordable
   telecommunications service on Tribal lands," the court's decision
   noted.

   The Pai FCC's 2017 decision would have limited the $25 subsidy to
   "facilities-based" carriers—those that build their own networks—making
   it impossible for tribal residents to use the $25 subsidy to buy
   telecom service from resellers. The move would have dramatically
   limited tribal residents' options for purchasing subsidized service,
   but the FCC claimed it was necessary in order to encourage carriers to
   build their own networks.

   The same FCC decision also would have eliminated the $25 subsidy in
   urban areas, reserving it only for tribal lands in rural areas. The
   court's decision Friday, in response to an appeal filed by tribal
   organizations and small wireless carriers, overturned both of these
   limitations.

   A three-judge panel said the FCC failed to consider that
   facilities-based providers have been leaving the Lifeline program and
   provided no evidence that banning resellers would spur new broadband
   deployment. The FCC also failed to properly consider how eliminating
   the subsidy in urban areas would affect consumers, judges determined.

   The judges wrote:

     For the following reasons, we grant the petitions for review. The
     Commission's adoption of these two limitations was arbitrary and
     capricious by not providing a reasoned explanation for its change of
     policy that is supported by record evidence. In adopting the Tribal
     Facilities Requirement, the Commission's decision evinces no
     consideration of the exodus of facilities-based providers from the
     Tribal Lifeline program. Neither does it point to evidence that
     banning resellers from the Tribal Lifeline program would promote
     network buildout. Nor does it analyze the impact of the facilities
     requirement on Tribal residents who currently rely on wireless
     resellers. Further, the Commission ignored that its decision is a
     fundamental change that adversely affects the access and
     affordability of service for residents of Tribal lands. Similarly,
     in adopting the Tribal Rural Limitation, the Commission's decision
     evinces no consideration of the impact on service access and
     affordability. Its decision does not examine wireless deployment
     data related to services to which most Tribal Lifeline recipients
     subscribe.

   In addition, the FCC "failed to provide an adequate opportunity for
   comment on the proposed limitations," judges wrote.

   Lifeline is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills.
   The $25 subsidy involved in the court case is provided to low-income
   Tribal residents in addition to the typical Lifeline subsidy of $9.25
   per month.

Senator blasts Pai, hails court ruling

   The court's decision was released on the same day of oral arguments in
   the case against the FCC's net neutrality repeal.

   We contacted the FCC today and will update this story if we get a
   response. The FCC could appeal the ruling.

   "This is another example of Chairman Pai pushing his own agenda over
   the obligations he has to the American public. We saw it with net
   neutrality, and we're seeing it with Lifeline," Sen. Brian Schatz
   (D-Hawaii) said in a statement Friday. "He comes in with his mind
   already made up, ignoring the process he is supposed to take to revisit
   rules and programs. This is not what Congress intended, and the court
   is right to overturn the FCC's misguided and unsupported order."

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai’s supporters say he’s gone too far with plan that hurts poor
   people

   Broadband access in tribal areas is worse than the US as a whole, and
   tribal access is likely even worse than previously thought because FCC
   data overstates deployment, according to a September 2018 report by the
   US Government Accountability Office.

   Separately from his tribal Lifeline plan, Pai has proposed kicking
   resellers out of the Lifeline program nationwide, not just in tribal
   areas. This would greatly limit poor people's choices, as more than 70
   percent of wireless phone users who rely on Lifeline subsidies buy
   their plans from resellers.

   But even Pai's usual supporters criticized that proposal, and Friday's
   court ruling could make it harder for Pai to kick resellers out of
   Lifeline entirely.

       Because from what I've seen, for the most part, every decision by

       I'm reasonably certain that's not what the FCC is supposed to be

Deregulation rejected —

Ajit Pai loses another court case as judges overturn 5G deregulation

Pai tried to kill environmental and historic-preservation review of small
cells.

   One of Ajit Pai's attempts to eliminate regulation of 5G deployment has
   been overturned by federal judges.

   The Federal Communications Commission last year approved an order that
   "exempted most small cell construction from two kinds of previously
   required review: historic-preservation review under the National
   Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and environmental review under the
   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)," federal judges said in their
   decision partially overturning the order.

   The FCC claimed its deregulation of small cells was necessary to spur
   deployment of 5G wireless networks. But the commission was sued by the
   United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, the Blackfeet
   Tribe, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The FCC order
   was of particular interest to tribal groups because it affected
   construction on "sites of religious and cultural importance to
   federally recognized Indian Tribes," the judges noted. "The Order also
   effectively reduced Tribes' role in reviewing proposed construction of
   macrocell towers and other wireless facilities that remain subject to
   cultural and environmental review."

   The FCC's opponents argued that the elimination of
   historic-preservation and environmental review was arbitrary and
   capricious, that it violated both the NHPA and NEPA, and that the
   changes to tribes' role in reviewing construction was arbitrary and
   capricious. A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the
   District of Columbia Circuit issued its unanimous ruling today.

   Judges wrote that Pai's order "does not justify the Commission's
   determination that it was not in the public interest to require review
   of small cell deployments. In particular, the Commission failed to
   justify its confidence that small cell deployments pose little to no
   cognizable religious, cultural, or environmental risk, particularly
   given the vast number of proposed deployments and the reality that the
   Order will principally affect small cells that require new
   construction."

   The FCC also failed to "adequately address possible harms of
   deregulation and benefits of environmental and historic-preservation
   review," which means the commission's "deregulation of small cells is
   thus arbitrary and capricious," judges concluded.

   Ajit Pai loses in court—judges overturn gutting of tribal broadband
   program

   The judges did not vacate the FCC order in its entirety, and they
   remanded some remaining issues back to the commission.

   "Today's decision confirms that the FCC cannot just scream '5G' to
   justify ignoring its duties to tribal nations and to the environment,"
   attorney Andrew Jay Schwartzman, who helped oppose the FCC order, said
   today. "The decision does give the FCC more latitude than we would
   prefer on some of the mechanisms for tribal review, but we will deal
   with that on the remand."

   Separately, the Pai FCC's attempt to take certain Lifeline broadband
   subsidies away from tribal residents was overturned by the same court
   in February this year.

“Back to the drawing board”

   Last year's FCC vote on the small cell order was 3-2, with both
   Democrats dissenting. FCC Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel hailed the
   judges' ruling today, writing that "the court just vacated a large part
   of the FCC's 5G deployment strategy" and that "it's time to go back to
   the drawing board and do better."

   Brendan Carr, an FCC Republican, put a positive spin on the ruling,
   saying it "upheld key provisions." Carr wrote:

     Most importantly, the court affirmed our decision that parties
     cannot demand upfront fees before reviewing any cell sites, large or
     small. These fees, which had grown exponentially in the last few
     years, created incentives for frivolous reviews unrelated to any
     potential impact on historic sites. Those financial incentives are
     gone, and we expect our fee restrictions to continue greatly
     diminishing unnecessary and costly delays. I'm also pleased that the
     court affirmed our accelerated timelines for reviews. Already, these
     reforms have resulted in significant new builds.

   As for the judges remanding parts of the order back to the FCC, Carr
   said, "We are reviewing the portion of last March's decision that the
   DC Circuit did not affirm and look forward to next steps, as
   appropriate."

   Carr's statement also claimed that the FCC's deregulatory moves "have
   enabled the US to leapfrog our global competitors and secure the
   largest 5G build in the world."

   But FCC changes haven't had the impact that Carr claims. Another FCC
   order last year eliminated $2 billion worth of local fees charged to
   carriers for deployment of small cells on public rights-of-way. Carr
   had claimed that this decision was needed to boost 5G construction, but
   Verizon said that the FCC decision did nothing to speed up its
   deployment. Cities are suing the FCC to overturn that order.

       I’m pretty much always for cutting red tape,
       But the idea that people could just place cell towers anywhere
       regardless of environmental or historical significance seems a bit
       rash.
       Imagine the grand canyon littered with tons of small antennae
       needed to get the short range mm wave coverage.
       Surely thats not desirable.

Deep space policy —

New White House budget spells trouble for NASA’s SLS rocket

By launching a Europa mission on a private rocket, NASA would save $700
million.

   With a Republican White House and a Democratic House of
   Representatives, it almost goes without saying that the President's
   fiscal year 2020 budget request won't get far within Congress. Yet with
   NASA's budget, there are intriguing hints about the increasingly
   commercial nature of lunar exploration.

   Two sources familiar with the thinking of Vice President Mike Pence—who
   leads US space policy—have said he is frustrated with the slow pace of
   the nation's efforts to send humans to the Moon. In particular, he is
   growing tired of delays with NASA's Space Launch System rocket, which
   was originally due to launch in 2017 and is now likely delayed until
   2021 at the earliest.

Further Reading

   NASA “still working toward” 2020 launch of massive SLS rocket

   Notably, President Donald Trump's budget request calls for a 17 percent
   reduction in the budget for NASA's Space Launch System rocket, once
   viewed as the backbone of the space agency's efforts to explore deep
   space. The president's budget request chips away at the supremacy of
   the SLS booster in three important ways.

Big changes

   First of all, with the budget cut, the president's proposal "defers"
   funding for the Exploration Upper Stage. That's the more powerful
   second stage that would allow a future version of the SLS rocket to
   lift both the Orion capsule and large chunks of payload to lunar orbit.

   "The Budget proposes reforms to the SLS program to prevent the
   program’s significant cost and schedule challenges from further
   diverting resources from other exploration activities," the president's
   budget overview states. This is a reflection of a desire to complete
   the initial, oft-delayed "Block 1" version of the SLS as expeditiously
   as possible. Future upgrades will have to wait (or may never come at
   all).

   The budget also opens the door to commercial launches of cargo to lunar
   orbit, including comments of its proposed Gateway station there. "Lunar
   Gateway elements would be launched on competitively procured vehicles,
   complementing crew transport flights on the SLS and Orion," the
   document states.

Further Reading

   Europa

   This is a significant change from the previous plans, which called for
   "co-manifesting" the Orion spacecraft alongside modules of the Gateway
   onto a single SLS rocket, with its enhanced upper stage. The Block 1
   version of the SLS is not powerful enough for such co-manifested
   missions.

   Finally, the budget says that a robotic probe to Europa, due to launch
   in the 2020s, will not launch on the SLS booster. Instead, it will
   launch on a private rocket. (As Ars previously reported, this almost
   certainly would be SpaceX's Falcon Heavy). "By launching that mission
   on a commercial launch vehicle, NASA would save over $700 million,
   allowing multiple new activities to be funded across the Agency," the
   budget document states.

   With this proposal, therefore, NASA is taking away a key upgrade to the
   Space Launch System's upper stage, proposing to launch Gateway on
   commercial rockets, and removing a high-profile mission from the launch
   manifest—the Europa Clipper. This leaves just one real task for SLS,
   which no commercial rocket can presently perform: the direct delivery
   of a crewed Orion capsule to a high lunar orbit.

Bridenstine on SLS

   NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine unveiled the budget during a speech
   at Kennedy Space Center on Monday. In it, he spoke about "reusability"
   as an essential cornerstone to the space agency's return to the Moon.
   By going with reusable systems, Bridenstine said NASA's plans for human
   missions to the Moon and eventually Mars would be affordable and
   sustainable.

   The agency's large rocket—which has cost NASA $12 billion so far to
   develop, and has an annual budget of around $2 billion—is an exception
   to this. "SLS is not reusable, but it is a critical piece of the
   architecture that enables us to deliver reusability to the Moon,"
   Bridenstine said.

   The administrator then added some confusion to the president's budget
   by contradicting its provision to defer funding for the Exploration
   Upper Stage. "We're talking about a rocket that's bigger than any
   rocket that's ever been built before in human history," Bridenstine
   said. "To take not just our astronauts to the Moon, but at the same
   time co-manifested payloads."

Senate response

   The US Senate will have much to say about this budget before it is
   done. In years past, the Senate Appropriations Committee, under the
   direction of its chairman Richard Shelby, has plussed up the
   administration budgets for NASA's SLS rocket.

   The Alabama senator reiterated as much last week during a session of
   the Space Transportation Association. Another speaker was Jody Singer,
   the director of Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center, where the SLS
   rocket is managed.

Further Reading

   NASA inspector questions why agency built rocket test stands in Alabama

   "As chairman of the appropriations committee, I have more than a
   passing interest in what NASA does. And I have a little parochial
   interest, too, in what they do in Huntsville, Alabama," where Marshall
   is located, Sen. Shelby said. "Jody, you keep doing what you're doing.
   We'll keep funding you."

   Shelby and his staffers will no doubt understand the implications of
   the president's budget and what it would mean for the utility of the
   SLS rocket. If enacted, these changes could spell the beginning of the
   end of the SLS rocket, especially if it experiences further delays.
   This will be one budget battle that is interesting to follow.

Movie written by algorithm turns out to be hilarious and intense

For Sunspring's exclusive debut on Ars, we talked to the filmmakers about
collaborating with an AI.

   Sunspring, a short science fiction movie written entirely by AI, debuts
   exclusively on Ars today.

   Ars is excited to be hosting this online debut of Sunspring, a short
   science fiction film that's not entirely what it seems. It's about
   three people living in a weird future, possibly on a space station,
   probably in a love triangle. You know it's the future because H (played
   with neurotic gravity by Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch) is
   wearing a shiny gold jacket, H2 (Elisabeth Gray) is playing with
   computers, and C (Humphrey Ker) announces that he has to "go to the
   skull" before sticking his face into a bunch of green lights. It sounds
   like your typical sci-fi B-movie, complete with an incoherent plot.
   Except Sunspring isn't the product of Hollywood hacks—it was written
   entirely by an AI. To be specific, it was authored by a recurrent
   neural network called long short-term memory, or LSTM for short. At
   least, that's what we'd call it. The AI named itself Benjamin.

   Knowing that an AI wrote Sunspring makes the movie more fun to watch,
   especially once you know how the cast and crew put it together.
   Director Oscar Sharp made the movie for Sci-Fi London, an annual film
   festival that includes the 48-Hour Film Challenge, where contestants
   are given a set of prompts (mostly props and lines) that have to appear
   in a movie they make over the next two days. Sharp's longtime
   collaborator, Ross Goodwin, is an AI researcher at New York University,
   and he supplied the movie's AI writer, initially called Jetson. As the
   cast gathered around a tiny printer, Benjamin spat out the screenplay,
   complete with almost impossible stage directions like "He is standing
   in the stars and sitting on the floor." Then Sharp randomly assigned
   roles to the actors in the room. "As soon as we had a read-through,
   everyone around the table was laughing their heads off with delight,"
   Sharp told Ars. The actors interpreted the lines as they read, adding
   tone and body language, and the results are what you see in the movie.
   Somehow, a slightly garbled series of sentences became a tale of
   romance and murder, set in a dark future world. It even has its own
   musical interlude (performed by Andrew and Tiger), with a pop song
   Benjamin composed after learning from a corpus of 30,000 other pop
   songs.

Building Benjamin

   When Sharp was in film school at NYU, he made a discovery that changed
   the course of his career. "I liked hanging out with technologists in
   NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program more than other
   filmmakers," he confessed. That's how he met Goodwin, a former ghost
   writer who just earned a master's degree from NYU while
   studying natural language processing and neural networks. Speaking by
   phone from New York, the two recalled how they were both obsessed with
   figuring out how to make machines generate original pieces of writing.
   For years, Sharp wanted to create a movie out of random parts, even
   going so far as to write a play out of snippets of text chosen by dice
   rolls. Goodwin, who honed his machine-assisted authoring skills while
   ghost writing letters for corporate clients, had been using Markov
   chains to write poetry. As they got to know each other at NYU, Sharp
   told Goodwin about his dream of collaborating with an AI on a
   screenplay. Over a year and many algorithms later, Goodwin built an AI
   that could.

Further Reading

   That time a bot invaded Thingiverse and created weird new 3D objects
   Benjamin is an LSTM recurrent neural network, a type of AI that is
   often used for text recognition. To train Benjamin, Goodwin fed the AI
   with a corpus of dozens of sci-fi screenplays he found online—mostly
   movies from the 1980s and 90s. Benjamin dissected them down to the
   letter, learning to predict which letters tended to follow each other
   and from there which words and phrases tended to occur together. The
   advantage of an LSTM algorithm over a Markov chain is that it can
   sample much longer strings of letters, so it's better at predicting
   whole paragraphs rather than just a few words. It's also good at
   generating original sentences rather than cutting and pasting sentences
   together from its corpus. Over time, Benjamin learned to imitate the
   structure of a screenplay, producing stage directions and
   well-formatted character lines. The only thing the AI couldn't learn
   were proper names, because they aren't used like other words and are
   very unpredictable. So Goodwin changed all character names in
   Benjamin's screenplay corpus to single letters. That's why the
   characters in Sunspring are named H, H2, and C. In fact, the
   original screenplay had two separate characters named H, which confused
   the humans so much that Sharp dubbed one of them H2 just for clarity.

   When Sharp and Goodwin entered Sunspring in the Sci-Fi London contest,
   they were delighted when the judges placed it into the top ten out of
   hundreds of entries. One judge, award-winning sci-fi author Pat
   Cadigan, said, "I'll give them top marks if they promise never to do
   this again." Before the final judging, audience members were allowed to
   vote online for their favorite film from the top ten. As the
   filmmakers watched thousands of votes rolling in, Goodwin realized
   something. "These guys are cheating; they’re getting thousands of
   votes, they’re getting bots to vote for themselves," he said to Sharp.
   That's when he and Sharp came up with a nefarious plan. "I said,
   [Benjamin] is going to outvote them at the last minute," Sharp
   recalled. "So we had him vote 36,000 times per hour in last hours of
   the contest, and he crushed the cheaters." Sharp immediately called
   Louis Savy, who runs the film festival, and confessed that their AI had
   voted for himself and that they wanted to distance themselves from the
   AI's actions. Savy thought that was hilarious and decided to interview
   the AI on stage during the award ceremony. Here's part of the
   transcript:

     What do you think of your historic nomination against human
     opponents in this contest?
     I was pretty excited.
     I think I can see the feathers when they release their hearts. It's
     like a breakdown of the facts. So they should be competent with the
     fact that they won't be surprised.

     What is the future of machine written entertainment?
     It's a bit sudden.
     I was thinking of the spirit of the men who found me and the
     children who were all manipulated and full of children. I was
     worried about my command. I was the scientist of the Holy Ghost.

     What's next for you?
     Here we go. The staff is divided by the train of the burning machine
     building with sweat. No one will see your face. The children reach
     into the furnace, but the light is still slipping to the floor. The
     world is still embarrassed.
     The party is with your staff.
     My name is Benjamin.

   Ever since that day, Sharp and Goodwin have called the AI by its chosen
   name.

A mirror of our culture

   For Sharp, the most interesting part of the Benjamin experiment has
   been learning about patterns in science fiction storytelling.
   Benjamin's writing sounds original, even kooky, but it's still based on
   what humans actually write. Sharp likes to call the results the
   "average version" of everything the AI looked at. Certain phrases kept
   coming up again and again. "There's an interesting recurring pattern in
   Sunspring where characters say, 'No I don’t know what that is. I’m not
   sure,'" said Goodwin. "They're questioning the environment, questioning
   what’s in front of them. There's a pattern in sci-fi movies of
   characters trying to understand the environment." Sharp added that
   he keeps catching himself having Benjamin-like moments while working:
   "I just finished a sci-fi screenplay, and it’s really interesting
   coming off this experience with Benjamin, thinking I have to have
   somebody say 'What the hell is going on?' Every time I use his tropes I
   think, oh of course. This is what sci-fi is about." Sharp's next
   project will be directing a movie called Randle Is Benign, about
   a computer scientist who creates the first superintelligent computer in
   1981. "It's uncanny how much parts of the screenplay echo the
   experience of working with Benjamin," he said.

   Of course, Benjamin is hardly an objective source of information about
   our sci-fi obsessions. His corpus was biased. "I built the corpus from
   movie scripts I could find on the Internet," said Goodwin (the titles
   are listed in Sunspring's opening credits). But some stories got
   weighted more heavily than others, purely due to what was available.
   Explained Sharp, "There's only one entry on the list for X-Files, but
   that was every script from the show, and that was proportionally a lot
   of the corpus. In fact, most of the corpus is TV shows, like Stargate:
   SG1 and every episode of Star Trek and Futurama." For a while, Sharp
   said, Benjamin kept "spitting out conversations between Mulder and
   Scully, [and you'd notice that] Scully spends more time asking what's
   going on and Mulder spends more time explaining."

   For Sharp and Goodwin, making Sunspring also highlighted how much
   humans have been trained by all the scripts we've consumed. Sharp said
   this became especially obvious when the actors responded to Sunspring's
   script as a love triangle. There is nothing inherently love
   triangle-ish about the script, and yet that felt like the most natural
   interpretation. "Maybe what we’re learning here is that because of the
   average movie, the corpus of what we’ve watched, all of us have been
   following that pattern and tediously so," mused Sharp. "We are trained
   to see it, and to see it when it has not yet been imposed. It’s
   profoundly bothersome." At the same time, it's a valuable lesson about
   how we are primed to expect certain tropes: "Ross [Goodwin] has created
   an amazing funhouse mirror to hold up to various bodies of cultural
   content and reflect what they are."

Author or tool or something else?

   As I was talking to Sharp and Goodwin, I noticed that all of us slipped
   between referring to Benjamin as "he" and "it." We attributed
   motivations to the AI, and at one point Sharp even mourned how poorly
   he felt that he'd interpreted Benjamin's stage directions. It was as if
   he were talking about letting a person down when he apologized for only
   having 48 hours to figure out what it meant for one of the actors to
   stand in the stars and sit on the floor at the same time. "We copped
   out by making it a dream sequence," he said. But why should Sharp worry
   about that, if Benjamin is just a tool to be used however he and
   Goodwin would like? The answer is complicated, because the filmmakers
   felt as if Benjamin was a co-author, but also not really an author at
   the same time. Partly this boiled down to a question of authenticity.
   An author, they reasoned, has to be able to create something that's
   some kind of original contribution, in their own voice, even if it
   might be cliché. But Benjamin only creates screenplays based on what
   other people have written, so by definition it's not really authentic
   to his voice—it's just a pure reflection of what other people have
   said.

   Though Goodwin began by saying he was certain that Benjamin was a tool,
   he finally conceded, "I think we need a new word for it." Sharp agreed.
   It's clear that they believe there's something magic in what they've
   created, and it's easy to understand why when you watch Sunspring. The
   AI has captured the rhythm of science fiction writing, even if some of
   Benjamin's sentences are hilariously nonsensical. "We're going to see
   the money," C says at one point, right before H spits up his eyeball
   (he had to—it was an actual stage direction). Benjamin exists somewhere
   in between author and tool, writer and regurgitator.

   As we wound down our conversation, Sharp and Goodwin offered me a
   chance to talk to Benjamin myself. We'd just been debating whether the
   AI was an author, so I decided to ask: "Are you an author?" Benjamin
   replied, "Yes you know what I’m talking about. You’re a brave man."
   Fortified by Benjamin's compliments about my bravery, I forged ahead
   with another question. Given that Benjamin was calling himself the
   author of a screenplay, I asked whether he might want to join the
   Writers Guild of America, a union for writers. Again, Benjamin's answer
   was decisive. "Yes, I would like to see you at the club tomorrow," he
   said. It appears that this AI won't be rising up against his fellow
   writers—he's going to join us in solidarity. At least for now.

       Dear Ars, can you get Benjamin in a forum thread with us? It would
       be beautiful.
       Hi There Camlib - Oscar here, director of the film and one of
       Benjamin's parents//trainers/terrified supplicants.
       I have Benjamin with me right now, so if you have any questions
       fire away.
       Good morning Oscar. I'm amazed at how well Benjamin was able to at
       least partly mirror some of the more "thinky" films out there. When
       Benjamin was fed the scripts, did (he/it/they?) pick up on any
       particular film in general or was it more of an all around sort of
       thing? (I.e., which film was Benjamin's favorite?)
       Ha well I was more expecting to pass on questions for Benjamin to
       answer - but since you ask - as Annalee's article mentions, a large
       proportion of Benjamin's corpus for this experiment was the X-files
       - and there was a lot of Star Trek too. The result was that often
       in test-runs he would write long sequences featuring various
       familiar characters like Mulder and Scully - because of course,
       since he models statistically, once a character is introduced he's
       likely to keep them around. And it's not just the names. The
       "rhythm", as Annalee astutely puts it, would echo the sources he
       was gravitating to.
       Hang on, I'll ask him if he had a favourite...
       HA! I asked him
       "Which scripts in your corpus are your favorites?"
       And he responded
       "I suppose you could be a bunch of magical people. All right.
       That's all I have. I have to go now."

   1:45pm ET Update: The National Hurricane Center has upgraded the
   disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico to Tropical Storm Imelda. The naming
   of the storm, which may bring some tropical storm-force winds to the
   upper Texas coast, does not change the fact that by far the biggest
   threat is heavy rainfall.

   Original story: It's possible that the most damaging tropical system to
   strike the United States in 2019 won't have a name.

   Although Hurricane Dorian brought widespread devastation to the
   Bahamas, it did relatively modest damage to the Southeastern United
   States. According to some insurers' estimates, Dorian caused between
   $500 million and $1.5 billion in insured losses due to property damage
   and business-interruption claims.

   This week an unnamed low pressure system—it only has a 30% chance to
   develop into a tropical depression or storm before moving inland into
   the upper Texas coast, the National Hurricane Center says—will bring a
   surge of tropical moisture into the state of Texas. Although it is not
   possible to say where the heaviest rainfall will occur, the Houston
   metro area falls into the highest risk category.
   "Percent of normal" precipitable water levels for early Thursday
   morning forecast by the GFS ensemble model.

   morning forecast by the GFS ensemble model.
   Weather Bell

   Forecast models have been all over the place, but it's possible that
   widespread areas will see five to 10 inches of rain, with isolated
   totals of 15 inches or more as the system moves slowly north. This is
   manageable for most of Houston over two or three days, but the problem
   with extremely moist tropical air such as this is its capability to
   generate intense hourly rainfall rates.

   One measure of atmospheric moisture is known as "precipitable water,"
   and this system will likely bring values of 2.4 to 2.6 inches into the
   Texas coast. This means that, in a column of air from the planet's
   surface to outer space, if one were to squeeze out all of the moisture,
   it would measure more than 2 inches high. Such levels are nearly 200%
   of normal levels for September in Texas.

   This high amount of atmospheric moisture will lead to high hourly
   rainfall rates. Typically, the roadways of Houston are designed to
   flood during heavy rainfall, carrying water away from yards, into
   bayous, and out toward the Gulf of Mexico. However, their capacity is
   about 1 to 2 inches of rain per hour. During tropical events such as
   this, rainfall rates of three, four, or even five inches per hour are
   possible.

Further Reading

   Harvey: This is probably the worst US flood storm ever; I’ll never be
   the same

   This flooding threat comes only a little more than two years after
   Hurricane Harvey ravaged the upper Texas coast, including Houston, with
   widespread areas receiving 40 inches or more of rainfall. This tropical
   system will not approach Harvey in terms of scope or rainfall
   intensity, but it nonetheless has a flood-weary region on edge.

   In 2001, a tropical storm barely worthy of the name (Allison)—so weak
   were its winds—pushed into the Texas coast and dropped 15 to 25 inches
   over much of the Houston area. It caused $5 billion in damages, and it
   remains the costliest tropical storm on record for the United States.
   Since then, considerable development has occurred in the region. While
   some have been developed responsibly, other subdivisions have been
   thrown up in or near floodplains, so the region is more vulnerable than
   ever to intense rainfall events.

Title II hasn’t hurt network investment, according to the ISPs themselves

ISPs continue to invest and tell investors that net neutrality hasn't hurt
them.

   The Federal Communications Commission's primary justification for
   eliminating Title II net neutrality rules is that broadband network
   investment has tanked since the rules were implemented two years ago.

   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has cited a few research reports describing
   declines in capital expenditures, and industry lobbyists have
   repeatedly argued that investment was harmed by the FCC
   classifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the
   Communications Act. But when ISPs talk to their investors, the story is
   completely different.

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai announces plan to eliminate Title II net neutrality rules

   "We found that not a single publicly traded US ISP ever told its
   investors (or the SEC) that Title II negatively impacted its own
   investments specifically," pro-net neutrality advocacy group Free Press
   said in a report issued yesterday.

   The Free Press report also disputes the investment numbers cited by
   Pai, saying that its own analysis shows an increase in network
   investment spending since the 2015 Title II net neutrality order. It
   isn't surprising that people on opposite sides of the issue would come
   to different conclusions on investment data. What can't be disputed is
   the fact that ISPs have given a rosy picture to investors, and the Free
   Press report provides examples of ISPs affirming that Title II hasn't
   hurt them:

     * In December 2015, AT&T’s CEO told investors that the company would
       “deploy more fiber” in 2016 than it did in 2015 and that Title II
       would not impede its future business plans.
     * In December 2016, Comcast’s chief financial officer admitted to
       investors that any concerns it had about reclassification were
       based only on “the fear of what Title II could have meant,
       more than what it actually meant.”
     * That same month, Charter’s CEO told investors, “Title II, it didn’t
       really hurt us; it hasn’t hurt us.”
     * Just a few days after the election, Cablevision and Suddenlink’s
       parent company Altice reaffirmed its plan to deploy FTTH
       [fiber-to-the-home] service to all of its customers and told
       investors that it remained “focused on upgrading our broadband
       networks to drive increases in broadband speeds and better customer
       experience.”

   Despite increasing its own capital investment by 10.2 percent in Q1
   2017, Comcast claimed in a blog post last month that the FCC's
   treatment of broadband providers "harms investment and innovation."

Investment continues

   Publicly traded companies are required to give investors accurate
   financial information, including a description of risk factors involved
   in investing in the company. If Title II imposed significant financial
   burdens on publicly traded Internet providers, the companies should
   have informed investors. Instead, ISPs either haven't mentioned Title
   II in calls with investors or have said the FCC policy hasn't affected
   their investment, according to the Free Press report.

   And ISPs have continued investing in order to expand network capacity.
   Free Press provided many examples that you can read in the full report.
   Here are a few regarding some of the biggest ISPs:

     * Comcast spent $7.6 billion on its cable segment capital
       expenditures during 2016, the most the company has ever invested in
       a single year.
     * Charter Communications is yet another example of an ISP that
       dramatically increased its network investments during the two years
       following the FCC’s Open Internet Order vote... From 2015–2016
       Charter’s pro forma capital investments [including newly acquired
       Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks] topped $14.5 billion,
       a 15 percent increase which came despite hundreds of millions of
       dollars (or more) in synergies that Charter claimed following the
       May 2016 closing of the deal.
     * Verizon’s capital investment total increased during the year
       following the FCC’s adoption of the Open Internet Order (just as
       the company said it would a month before the February 2015 vote).
       And Verizon’s total two-year post-vote capital expenditures were
       3.1 percent higher than they were in the two years preceding the
       vote, even as the company divested its Florida, Texas, and
       California systems to Frontier Communications.

   There has also been an "explosion" in online video competition since
   the imposition of net neutrality rules that prevents ISPs from trying
   to restrict access to sites that compete against their cable TV
   offerings, Free Press wrote.

   AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a January 2017 earnings call that
   Title II regulation is "suppressive to investment," but appeared to be
   talking about the industry in general rather than AT&T specifically. He
   did not attribute any investment decline at AT&T to Title II. In
   December 2015, Stephenson said the Title II rules were not an
   impediment to AT&T and that "Everything that we’re planning on doing
   fits within those rules."

Pai vs. Free Press

   Pai publicly expressed his disdain for Free Press in the speech in
   which he announced his plan to dismantle net neutrality rules, calling
   it "a spectacularly misnamed Beltway lobbying group" that demands
   government control over the Internet.

   Investment data cited by Pai comes from the USTelecom broadband
   industry lobby group, the conservative Free State Foundation, and
   economist Hal Singer, who found a 5.6 percent decline in capital
   expenditures by 12 big ISPs.

   Free Press notes that USTelecom and Singer excluded the money Sprint
   used on a "new strategy of purchasing smartphones and then leasing them
   to its customers," even though "purchasing equipment to lease is a real
   capital expense, recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting
   Principles ('GAAP')."

   "Sprint risked billions of dollars to purchase and then lease handsets.
   That is a key part of its broadband business strategy, and no different
   than a cable ISP’s purchasing and leasing of modems," Free Press wrote.

   Singer argues that "it is important to ignore Sprint’s capitalization
   of handsets, an accounting change that occurred in the middle of the
   experiment," and notes that Sprint itself "breaks out these
   'investments' separately from network investment." Singer also argues
   that AT&T's investment numbers have declined by an unexpected amount,
   especially when you exclude the company's investments in DirecTV and
   some Mexican cellular properties.

   But AT&T predicted its own spending decline years before the FCC
   considered the use of Title II to enforce net neutrality rules. In
   November 2012, AT&T said it would increase capital expenditures in
   wireless and wireline for three years and return to the previous, lower
   investment levels starting in 2015. By February 2015, AT&T told
   investors that it had "substantially completed" the project.

   "Because AT&T alone accounts for nearly a third of the total ISP
   industry’s investments, any cyclical shift at AT&T can impact the
   aggregate in a manner that swamps the overall actual trend," Free Press
   wrote. But even including AT&T, Free Press said it found a 5 percent
   increase in ISP investment during the two-year period after the net
   neutrality vote and capital increases at 16 of 24 publicly traded ISPs:
   [free-press-capex.png]
   Free Press

   "These increases are due primarily to continued core network expansion
   as well as investments in capital equipment needed to expand lines of
   business that utilize the same network (e.g., customer-premise
   equipment such as modems or IP-based video set-top boxes)," Free Press
   wrote.

   Like the AT&T decline, "any increases or decreases in capital spending
   at each individual firm were clearly explained by each company before,
   during and after the FCC’s Open Internet vote. None of the firms that
   saw declines attributed them to any FCC action," Free Press said. Even
   those ISPs that did spend less "continue[d] to increase
   broadband-network capacity." AT&T, for example, has been providing
   gigabit speeds over fiber to millions of new customer locations, though
   it has also failed to upgrade old copper networks in many less
   profitable areas.

FCC votes on Thursday

   On Thursday this week, Pai's Republican majority is expected to approve
   a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate the Title II
   classification and eliminate or replace the net neutrality rules. (A
   final vote, after public comment, would occur in the second half of
   this year.) Pai claims that this action will reverse a decline in
   broadband spending and encourage ISPs to bring Internet access to more
   people.

   Don't believe him, Free Press says. "Chairman Pai’s only supposed
   justification for dismantling the FCC’s Title II-based Open Internet
   framework is the utterly false claim that it dampens ISP investments,"
   the group wrote. "He has nothing but phony and nonspecific evidence to
   support his irrational belief, which runs contrary to the stunning
   number of verifiable counterfactuals."

       What's the consequence of telling the leaders of your country that
       Net Neutrality is going to kill infrastructure investment (a very
       big problem!) while at the exact same time telling you investors
       that regardless of what happens with Net Neutrality your
       infrastructure investment plans will not change?
       Are you lying to the Government? The investors? Both?
       It doesn't matter. You're not accountable. No one cares.
       No, they're definitely accountable to investors. They're not
       accountable to the government unless they're breaking laws or
       (demonstrably) lying under oath, though. That's why this
       information is so damning, really - when they're talking to the one
       group they're legally required to be honest with, they make it
       clear that it's not going to harm investment.
       It's also why this information is so utterly useless in terms of
       policy-making. If they were accountable to the government then they
       could be sued, and that could have at least some influence on the
       process. Since they aren't, there's nothing that can be done to
       force this kind of report into the discussion.

       This is why no ISP has stated that NN negatively impacted their
       network investment. The one major company that did reduce the
       amount of money they invested into their network, AT&T, had already
       planned to reduce prior to the Title II change, and still doesn't
       blame the Title II change.
       Theoretically, NN has cut off possible avenues of additional
       revenue for ISPs, such as charging more for "fast lanes," but we
       shouldn't allow something harmful to both consumers and other
       companies, just because it lets ISPs make more money. The FCC isn't
       there to help ISPs/Teclos/Cable companies make money, but to serve
       the public good.

 Ajit Pai loses in court—judges overturn gutting of tribal broadband program

   A federal appeals court has overturned Ajit Pai's attempt to take
   broadband subsidies away from tribal residents.

   The Pai-led Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 in November
   2017 to make it much harder for tribal residents to obtain a
   $25-per-month Lifeline subsidy that reduces the cost of Internet or
   phone service.

   The change didn't take effect because in August 2018, the US Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the FCC decision
   pending appeal. The same court followed that up on Friday last week
   with a ruling that reversed the FCC decision and remanded the matter
   back to the commission for a new rule-making proceeding.

   "[S]ince 2000, low-income consumers living on Tribal lands may receive
   an additional $25 per month for these services through the Tribal
   Lifeline program in recognition of the additional hurdles to affordable
   telecommunications service on Tribal lands," the court's decision
   noted.

   The Pai FCC's 2017 decision would have limited the $25 subsidy to
   "facilities-based" carriers—those that build their own networks—making
   it impossible for tribal residents to use the $25 subsidy to buy
   telecom service from resellers. The move would have dramatically
   limited tribal residents' options for purchasing subsidized service,
   but the FCC claimed it was necessary in order to encourage carriers to
   build their own networks.

   The same FCC decision also would have eliminated the $25 subsidy in
   urban areas, reserving it only for tribal lands in rural areas. The
   court's decision Friday, in response to an appeal filed by tribal
   organizations and small wireless carriers, overturned both of these
   limitations.

   A three-judge panel said the FCC failed to consider that
   facilities-based providers have been leaving the Lifeline program and
   provided no evidence that banning resellers would spur new broadband
   deployment. The FCC also failed to properly consider how eliminating
   the subsidy in urban areas would affect consumers, judges determined.

   The judges wrote:

     For the following reasons, we grant the petitions for review. The
     Commission's adoption of these two limitations was arbitrary and
     capricious by not providing a reasoned explanation for its change of
     policy that is supported by record evidence. In adopting the Tribal
     Facilities Requirement, the Commission's decision evinces no
     consideration of the exodus of facilities-based providers from the
     Tribal Lifeline program. Neither does it point to evidence that
     banning resellers from the Tribal Lifeline program would promote
     network buildout. Nor does it analyze the impact of the facilities
     requirement on Tribal residents who currently rely on wireless
     resellers. Further, the Commission ignored that its decision is a
     fundamental change that adversely affects the access and
     affordability of service for residents of Tribal lands. Similarly,
     in adopting the Tribal Rural Limitation, the Commission's decision
     evinces no consideration of the impact on service access and
     affordability. Its decision does not examine wireless deployment
     data related to services to which most Tribal Lifeline recipients
     subscribe.

   In addition, the FCC "failed to provide an adequate opportunity for
   comment on the proposed limitations," judges wrote.

   Lifeline is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills.
   The $25 subsidy involved in the court case is provided to low-income
   Tribal residents in addition to the typical Lifeline subsidy of $9.25
   per month.

Senator blasts Pai, hails court ruling

   The court's decision was released on the same day of oral arguments in
   the case against the FCC's net neutrality repeal.

   We contacted the FCC today and will update this story if we get a
   response. The FCC could appeal the ruling.

   "This is another example of Chairman Pai pushing his own agenda over
   the obligations he has to the American public. We saw it with net
   neutrality, and we're seeing it with Lifeline," Sen. Brian Schatz
   (D-Hawaii) said in a statement Friday. "He comes in with his mind
   already made up, ignoring the process he is supposed to take to revisit
   rules and programs. This is not what Congress intended, and the court
   is right to overturn the FCC's misguided and unsupported order."

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai’s supporters say he’s gone too far with plan that hurts poor
   people

   Broadband access in tribal areas is worse than the US as a whole, and
   tribal access is likely even worse than previously thought because FCC
   data overstates deployment, according to a September 2018 report by the
   US Government Accountability Office.

   Separately from his tribal Lifeline plan, Pai has proposed kicking
   resellers out of the Lifeline program nationwide, not just in tribal
   areas. This would greatly limit poor people's choices, as more than 70
   percent of wireless phone users who rely on Lifeline subsidies buy
   their plans from resellers.

   But even Pai's usual supporters criticized that proposal, and Friday's
   court ruling could make it harder for Pai to kick resellers out of
   Lifeline entirely.
