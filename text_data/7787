Apple Shares Details on Cleaning and Protecting Your Apple Card in New
Support Document

   Wednesday August 21, 2019 2:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple this morning shared a new Apple Card support document, which
   covers proper cleaning and storage methods to maintain the card's
   signature white finish.
   If the Apple Card gets dirty, Apple recommends gently wiping it with a
   soft, damp microfiber cloth. A soft microfiber cloth moistened with
   isopropyl alcohol can also be used for stain removal.
   Apple says that household cleaners, abrasives, solvents, ammonia,
   aerosol sprays and compressed air must be avoided, and warns that some
   fabrics, such as leather and denim, have the potential to cause
   permanent discoloration.
   Due to the multi-layer coating process that gives the titanium card its
   white finish, Apple has detailed rules for proper storage.
   The Apple Card should be stored in a wallet, pocket, or bag constructed
   from soft materials, and it should not touch another credit card
   because doing so could cause scratching.
   Apple also warns against putting the Apple Card near magnets because
   doing so could cause the magnetic strip to become demagnetized, and
   Apple also says that the Apple Card should not be put in a pocket or
   bag that contains loose change, keys, or other potentially abrasive
   objects.
   Apple's full list of instructions for the Apple Card can be found in
   the support document. Additional Apple Card details are located in our
   Apple Card guide.

       iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.

Apple Shares Another Teaser for M. Night Shyamalan Apple TV+ Series 'Servant'

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today shared a new teaser trailer for its upcoming TV show
   "Servant," which is a psychological thriller created by Tony Basgallop
   and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan.
   The series is said to follow a Philadelphia couple (played by Tony
   Kebbell and Lauren Ambrose) who hire a young nanny named Leanne (Nell
   Tiger Free) to care for their newborn child, who, based on the
   trailers, appears to be a fake baby.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/lnYIcec-Ofk

   The new teaser trailer is one of three that Apple has shown so far,
   with the others previewed during the Emmy Awards in September.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/yVOB045BZDs

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/__-M5gA3pIU

   Servant will not be available when Apple TV+ launches on November 1,
   but it will be coming out soon after on November 28. Apple TV+ will be
   priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple is offering a free subscription to
   customers who purchase an Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
   At launch, Apple TV+ will offer several TV shows, including
   "Dickinson," "For All Mankind," "Helpsters," "Ghostwriter," and "The
   Morning Show."

Tim Cook Talks Cryptocurrency, Quality Journalism, Privacy and More on
European Tour

   Thursday October 3, 2019 5:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently in Europe, and over the course of the
   last few days, he's visited Germany, France, and Italy. Earlier this
   week we shared an interview he did with a German news site, and today
   he spoke with a French newspaper and students in Italy as part of an
   appearance at the Osservatorio Permanente.
   Cook commented on topics like journalism, privacy, and immigration,
   with his comments shared by Italian site Macitynet.it [Google
   Translate] and French newspaper Les Echoes (via CNBC).

                     Image shared by Tim Cook on Twitter

   According to Cook, while the internet has brought "many positive
   things," fake news is one negative. From a translation of the original
   interview:

     All of us lovers of democracy and freedom must think that separating
     the false from the true is the basis of freedom. Quality journalism
     is the foundation of every democracy and an open and free press is
     essential.

   Cook also spoke about a topic that he's covered many times in the past
   - privacy. He reiterated his belief that Apple customers are not
   Apple's product, and that Apple will not sell customer data. "At Apple,
   we will never treat you as products but as customers with dignity and
   respect," he said.
   Along with touching on privacy, Cook highlighted Apple's environmental
   efforts, such as the fact that Apple is run on 100 percent renewable
   energy, and he spoke on human rights. "We do not do it because it's
   required by regulations, but because it is a moral imperative," he
   said.
   Apple supports immigration because wealthy countries must "accept
   migrants who are fleeing difficult situations," said Cook. Cook added
   that he would like for young people and children to be able to stay in
   the United States to study, referencing his support for DACA, or the
   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy.
   Cook had advice for students regarding smartphone usage. "Smartphones
   must bring you closer to those who are far away - don't leave those
   close to you," he said. "If you spend more time looking at your
   smartphones than people's eyes, you're wrong."
   Cook also spoke about cryptocurrency according to CNBC, with statements
   originally shared by French site Les Echoes. Cook said that currency
   should stay in the hands of countries, and private companies should not
   look to gain power with cryptocurrency.

     "No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of
     countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group
     setting up a competing currency," he said.
     "A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way."

   Apple's vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey recently said that
   Apple is "watching" cryptocurrency in regards to potentially supporting

Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:59 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple may have recently acquired UK-based motion capture company
   IKinema, based on evidence from company filings and information shared
   by a MacRumors reader.
   IKinema offers animation technology that's used for games, virtual
   reality, and more. Earlier this year, for example, IKinema partnered
   with Ubisoft for IKinema's RunTime software for character creation.
   IKinema specialized in technology that allowed for real-time motion
   animation of virtual characters.

     IKINEMA's technology is embraced by development teams the world over
     to bring their games to life through delivery of high fidelity
     results in natural character locomotion and greater player immersion
     within dynamic game worlds, including substantial cost reduction and
     accelerated production levels by a factor of five times or more to
     expedite the release of games to market.

   Based on details from IKinema's mostly defunct website, the company
   considers itself a specialist in real-time procedural animation and
   whole body solving technology. IKinema has several videos on YouTube
   showing off its technology creating animated characters from real-life
   people, dogs, and more.

   According to a document filed with the UK government, Apple lawyer
   Peter Denwood, who handles Apple's international affairs, was named the
   director of IKinema on September 12, 2019, with his address listed as
   One Apple Park Way.
   The address of the company was also updated to 100 New Bridge Street in
   London on September 26, which is the address for Apple Europe Limited.
   The IKinema website is no longer functional with the exception of a few
   technical documents, and the company's Twitter and Facebook accounts
   stopped being updated on August 19. MacRumors reader Peter, who is in
   the industry, told MacRumors that IKinema customers have been left in
   the dark "for weeks" and that the acquisition was confirmed in a
   private Facebook Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Golden Master to Developers

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:07 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the golden master version of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, three days after seeding the tenth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The golden master version of macOS Catalina represents the final
   version of the update that will be provided to the public at release.
   The new macOS Catalina software can be downloaded using the Software
   Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper
   profile from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

Kuo: Apple to Launch 'iPhone SE 2' in Early 2020 With Similar Design as
iPhone 8, A13 Chip, and 3GB RAM

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:27 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple plans to release a lower-priced "iPhone SE 2" in the first
   quarter of 2020, according to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
   In a research note with TF International Securities, obtained by
   MacRumors, Kuo said the device will feature a similar form factor
   design and specifications as the iPhone 8, with a faster A13 chip and
   3GB of RAM:

     We forecast that Apple will launch the more affordable iPhone SE2 in
     1Q20. For the most part, the form factor design and hardware spec
     are similar to iPhone 8's. The most significant hardware spec
     upgrade will be the adoption of the A13 processor and 3GB LPDDR4X.
     iPhone SE2 will likely increase iPhone's market share and benefit
     Apple's promotions for service and content. We expect that the
     iPhone SE2 shipment will reach 30–40mn units in 2020.

   Kuo believes the "iPhone SE 2" will be the "best upgrade choice" for an
   estimated 100 million remaining iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users,
   serving as a "key growth driver" for Apple in 2020. He believes these
   customers have low desire for new features like Face ID and multiple
   cameras, suggesting the "iPhone SE 2" will stick with Touch ID and a
   single-lens rear camera.
   Kuo's prediction lines up with multiple other sources that have claimed
   Apple plans to release a new lower-cost iPhone 8-esque device next
   year, including the Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, Japanese
   publication Nikkei Asian Review, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby
   Wu.
   Those earlier reports indicated the device will sport a 4.7-inch
   display and a Touch ID home button like the iPhone 8. Apple continues
   to sell the iPhone 8 from $449, while the iPhone SE was $349 prior to
   being discontinued. When new, the iPhone 8 and iPhone SE started at
   $699 and $399 respectively.

Apple Supplier Epistar Says Clients Are Working on Mini-LED Products Amid
Rumors of Mini-LED iPad and MacBook

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:19 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Epistar president Chin-Yung Fan said his company's clients are
   developing notebooks, tablets, smartphones, and monitors with Mini-LED
   backlighting systems, which will naturally boost demand for Mini-LEDs
   in the second half of 2020, according to Taiwanese industry publication
   DigiTimes.
   Epistar is an Apple supplier, leading to the possibility that the
   iPhone maker is one of the unnamed clients working on Mini-LED
   products, as previously rumored, but Epistar declined to comment on any
   specific clients.
   Last week, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of investor firm TF
   International Securities said Apple plans to release an iPad with a
   Mini-LED display between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first
   quarter of 2021, followed by a MacBook with a Mini-LED display in the
   first or second quarter of 2021.
   Kuo said Epistar will be one of Apple's suppliers for those iPad and
   MacBook models. Epistar is the largest LED manufacturer in Taiwan.
   Kuo expects the iPad and MacBook to be positioned at the high end of
   their respective product lines due to costly Mini-LED display
   components, suggesting they will be iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models. He
   previously said the iPad will have a 10-12 inch screen and the MacBook
   will fall in the 15-17 inch range.
   Kuo added that the Mini-LED backlit displays will allow for thinner and
   lighter product designs, while offering many of the same benefits of
   OLED displays used on the latest iPhones, including good wide color
   gamut performance, high contrast and dynamic range, and local dimming
   for truer blacks.
   The future iPad and MacBook displays will each use approximately 10,000
   LEDs, compared to 576 in Apple's upcoming Pro Display XDR, according to
   Kuo. Each LED is said to be very small — below 200 microns in size.
   Apple continues to use traditional LCDs across its entire iPad and Mac
   lineups for now, but if this rumor proves to be accurate, we can expect
   the first Mini-LED models within the next 12 to 18 months or so. Prices
   will likely start on the higher side, but the technology should shuffle
   its way down the lineup over the years.

Microsoft Debuts New Dual-Screen Devices, Updated Surface Laptops and More

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 1:46 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Microsoft today held an event in New York City to show off both new
   Surface devices and some new dual screen devices that are coming in the
   future.
   MacRumors videographer Dan was in attendance at the event and was able
   to capture some footage of the newly announced products for an overview
   that can be watched over on our YouTube channel.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/UP0ARbs3a_k

         Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

   Microsoft's most exciting unveil was the Surface Neo and the Surface
   Duo, two foldable dual display devices. The Neo is tablet sized while
   the Duo is phone sized, and both have two displays that aren't
   connected together into one display but are instead displayed side by
   side with a hinge.
   The Surface Neo features two nine inch displays that can fold out into
   a larger 13-inch form factor, while the Duo has two 5.6-inch displays
   that fold out into an 8.3-inch tablet.
   You can hold these devices like a book, using one side for one app and
   the other side for another app, or you can fold them up into a more
   traditional form factor. They can also be unfolded into a laptop shape
   if desired.
   The Surface Neo (the larger of the two) has a detachable Bluetooth
   keyboard and a Wonder Bar that's similar to the Touch Bar on Apple's
   laptops but larger and with more functionality.
   Windows 10X, new custom software based on Windows 10 but designed for
   dual displays runs on the Neo, while the Duo, which is in fact
   Microsoft's first smartphone since the Windows Phone in 2017, runs a
   heavily skinned version of Android.
   These two devices were by far the most interesting devices Microsoft
   had to show off, but unfortunately, they're not launching until the
   holiday season in 2020 and Microsoft didn't even have prototypes
   available for attendees to test out.
   As for what's available now, Microsoft overhauled its Surface lineup.
   The new Surface Pro X, designed to compete with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro,
   features a 13-inch display and it's super slim and light. It has a
   cover that integrates with a new Surface Slim Pen, and there's an SSD
   that's user accessible.
   The Surface Pro X features an SQ1 processor, LTE connectivity, 13 hours
   of battery life, and 2 USB-C ports. It's priced starting at $999 and
   will be available in early November.
   Microsoft also unveiled a new version of its Surface Laptop 3, which
   comes in new colors and finishes, has a larger trackpad, and is
   equipped with a USB-C port. There's a standard 13-inch model and a new
   larger 15-inch model that uses AMD Ryzen Surface Edition chips.
   Pricing on the Surface Laptop 3 starts at $999 for the 13-inch model
   and $1199 for the 15-inch model, with Microsoft planning to release
   both later this month.
   Microsoft's final product of note is the new Surface Earbuds, which are
   wire-free earbuds that are designed to compete with Apple's AirPods.
   The Surface Earbuds have an unusual look, with an in-ear piece that
   fits into the ear and a circular disk that's quite large and sits in
   the outer part of the ear.
   The disk supports gestures for controlling playback and live
   transcription for communicating across multiple languages. Microsoft is
   charging $249 for its Surface Earbuds, and they'll be available later
   in the year.

Apple's Tim Cook and Deirdre O'Brien Urge Supreme Court to Protect Dreamers
by Upholding DACA

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 1:00 pm PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple today filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in
   support of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration
   policy. Apple has filed many briefs before the Court, but this is the
   first time that Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Vice President of Retail and
   People Deirdre O'Brien are named too.
   DACA provides around 800,000 individuals who entered the U.S. at age 16
   or younger with a renewable two-year period of deferred action from
   deportation, and eligibility for a work permit in the country. Many of
   these individuals, known as Dreamers, have lived in the U.S. for the
   majority of their lives.
   In its brief, Apple notes that it employs 443 Dreamers who come from
   more than 25 different countries spanning four continents. Dreamers at
   Apple run the gamut of roles within the company, including hardware
   engineering, software engineering, retail, customer support, and
   operations across 36 states.
   Apple says it would "quite literally not exist without a brilliant and
   driven population of immigrants," including Dreamers, adding that Apple
   co-founder Steve Jobs's father immigrated from Syria himself. Apple
   also mentions several studies that link a diverse workforce to a
   company's growth and success.
   The introduction of Apple's brief:

     Since 1976, Apple has made its name by designing, developing,
     selling, and maintaining cutting-edge consumer electronics including
     mobile communications devices, personal computers, and related
     software and services. Apple's success stems from its people. They
     shape and embody Apple's culture of innovation. Apple employs a
     diverse workforce of over 90,000 employees in the United States
     alone.
     Among those people are hundreds of DACA recipients who had no say in
     the decision to travel to this country and have known no other home.
     Apple employs DACA recipients who embody Apple's commitment to
     innovation in a wide variety of positions. As we explain below,
     they, and immigrants like them, are vital to Apple's success. They
     spark creativity and help drive innovation. They are among our most
     driven and selfless colleagues.

   And the conclusion:

     This is an issue where one's head and heart lead to the same
     conclusion. We collectively owe it to the Dreamers to hold up our
     end of the bargain. It is not just a legal requirement. It is the
     moral thing to do. Who are we as a country if we renege? What does
     it say about us as a people to turn our backs on the Dreamers now?

   The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the legality of DACA during its
   2019 term, which begins Monday, October 7.
   Apple's full amicus brief is embedded below.

What's New in iOS 13.2 Beta 1: Announce Messages With Siri, HomePod Handoff
and More

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 12:07 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Along with Deep Fusion for the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models,
   the iOS 13.2 developer beta that Apple released today also includes a
   few other major changes and updates that are worth noting.
   Below, we've rounded up all of the changes that we've found in iOS 13.2
   so far.
   - Announce Messages With Siri - The feature that's designed to allow
   Siri to announce incoming messages has been reenabled in iOS 13.2, and
   can be turned on by going to Settings > Siri > Search and toggling on
   Announce Messages.
   - Research Privacy Settings - iOS 13.2 has a new Research option in the
   Privacy section of the Settings app, which is for Apple's upcoming
   Research app. The Research app is not yet available, but the presence
   of the setting in iOS 13.2 suggests it may come when iOS 13.2 is
   released.
   - AirPlay & Handoff - The Handoff section of the Settings app (under
   General) is now AirPlay & Handoff with a new "Transfer to HomePod"
   option and an option to turn off automatic AirPlay to TVs.
   - Volume in Control Center - When you have AirPods, Beats Pro, BeatsX,
   or other Beats headphones connected to your iPhone or iPad, the volume
   control bar in Control Center will display an appropriate icon.
   - HomeKit Grouping - In the HomeKit app, there's a new option to group
   or ungroup accessories that have multiple functions, showing them
   either as a single tile or as multiple tiles. Multiple tiles was the
   pre-iOS 13 default, while Single Tile is the iOS 13 default.
   - New AirPods - As we reported earlier today, the iOS 13.2 beta
   contains images that unveil an upcoming AirPods design for the
   third-generation AirPods, which are rumored to have active noise
   canceling functionality.
   Know of a feature that's new in iOS 13.2 that we left out? Make sure to
   let us know in the comments and we'll update this article.

iOS 13.2 Beta Includes Icon Depicting New AirPods Design

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 11:32 am PDT by Steve Moser
   Apple has been rumored to be working on a third generation of AirPods
   with active noise control (ANC), also known as noise cancellation, or
   active noise reduction (ANR). Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested
   the updated AirPods could launch late this year or early next year with
   an "all-new design."
   Today's iOS 13.2 beta release includes an icon showing redesigned
   AirPods that appear to have rubber ear tips that would likely be needed
   as part of a noise cancelation feature.
   The file name includes reference to a B298 code name, and the image is
   contained in the Accessibility Settings folder. This could suggest
   these new AirPods will contain a new accessibility feature such as
   being able to use them as hearing aids, or it could be related to
   existing Live Listen capabilities.
   There's no specific word on when the new AirPods could debut, but Apple
   has a number of rumored pending announcements that could point toward
   an October media event.
   Update 11:55 AM: As noted by a MacRumors reader, a claimed photo leak
   last month from 52 Audio bears a strong resemblance to the image found
   in iOS 13.2, suggesting the leak may be accurate.

Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 to Developers With Deep
Fusion for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro [Update: Public Beta Available]

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:03 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today released the first betas of upcoming iOS and iPadOS 13.2
   updates to developers, just a week after the release of iOS 13.1 and
   two weeks after the iOS 13 update first debuted.
   iOS and iPadOS 13.2 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer
   Center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been
   installed.
   As announced yesterday, the iOS 13.2 update introduces Deep Fusion for
   the cameras in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models. Deep Fusion is a
   new image processing system that uses the A13 Bionic and the Neural
   Engine. Deep Fusion takes advantage of machine learning techniques to
   do pixel-by-pixel processing of photos, optimizing for texture,
   details, and noise in each part of the image.
   The feature is aimed at improving indoor photos and photos taken in
   medium lighting, and it's a feature that will automatically activate
   based on the lens being used and the light level in the room.
   Today's update also reintroduces the Announce with Siri feature for
   Messages, brings new Privacy controls for Apple's upcoming research
   app, and it even leaked an upcoming AirPods design. For a list of
   everything new in iOS 13.2, make sure to check out our article
   outlining the new features.
   Update: Apple has also seeded the iOS and iPadOS 13.2 betas to its
   public beta testing group.

Apple Asks Devs to Submit macOS Catalina Apps to Mac App Store, Reminds About
Notarization Requirements

   Thursday October 3, 2019 1:13 PM PDT by Juli Clover
   Ahead of the launch of macOS Catalina, which Apple says will "soon be
   available," Apple is asking developers to submit Mac apps compatible
   with Catalina to the Mac App Store.
   Apple encourages developers to take advantage of macOS Catalina
   technologies like Sign in with Apple, Sidecar, Core ML 3, and Metal.
   Apple also highlights Mac Catalyst, designed to bring iPad apps to the
   Mac.

     macOS Catalina will soon be available to hundreds of millions of
     users around the world. With macOS Catalina, your Mac apps can take
     advantage of Sign in with Apple, Sidecar, and the latest advances in
     Core ML 3, and Metal. And with Mac Catalyst, you can bring your iPad
     apps to Mac. Build your apps using Xcode 11, test them on a Mac
     computer running the macOS Catalina GM seed, and submit them for
     review.

   Separately, for apps that are designed to be distributed outside of the
   Mac App Store, Apple has reminded developers of a new notarization
   requirement.
   Apple is requiring apps that are distributed outside of the Mac App
   Store to be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina. First
   introduced in macOS Mojave, the notarization process is aimed at
   protecting Mac users from malicious and harmful apps.

     To further protect users on macOS Catalina, we're working with
     developers to make sure all software, whether distributed on the App
     Store or outside of it, is signed or notarized by Apple. This will
     give users more confidence that the software they download and run,
     no matter where they get it from, has been checked for known
     security issues.
     In June, we announced that all Mac software distributed outside the
     Mac App Store must be notarized by Apple in order to run by default
     on macOS Catalina. Make sure to test all versions of your software
     on the macOS Catalina GM seed and submit it to Apple to be
     notarized.

   For notarization, Apple offers trusted non Mac App Store developers
   Developer IDs that are required to allow the Gatekeeper function on
   macOS to install non Mac App Store apps.
   Notarization is not required for apps that are distributed through the
   Mac App Store, and Apple recently relaxed its notarization rules,
   giving developers until January 2020 to comply.
   Apple today released the golden master version of macOS Catalina to
   developers, which represents the final version of the software that
   will be provided to the public.
   It's still not known when macOS Catalina will launch, but it could be
   as early as tomorrow based on previously leaked info from Apple's
   Danish site.

Adobe Launches Premiere and Photoshop Elements 2020

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   Adobe today released updated versions of Photoshop Elements and
   Premiere Elements, the company's affordable photo and video editing
   software aimed at casual users who want to improve their photos and
   videos with simple editing tools.
   Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2020 feature updated Adobe Sensei AI
   technology, new guided edits for walking users through various features
   within each app, and updated ways to share content.
   Since the 2019 version, opening up the Home Screen in Photoshop and
   Premiere Elements has shown automatically generated photo and video
   slideshows with different effects powered by Adobe Sensei.
   In 2020, there are new effects like Black and White Selection, Pattern
   Brush for overlaying patterns on photos, Painterly for interesting
   masking and crops, and Depth of Field for blurring backgrounds to bring
   out subjects.
   Photoshop Elements has new editing features that users can take
   advantage of for quick but powerful edits. There's an option that will
   automatically colorize black and white photos or tweak the colors in an
   existing color photo.
   With one-click subject selection, users can select the subject of a
   photo with a click and then apply an effect or cut out a subject to put
   it in another photo.
   There's a new skin smoothing feature that will automatically smooth and
   refine the skin of a subject in a photo using Adobe Sensei technology,
   and Adobe has added several new Guided Edits (aka tutorials). Guided
   Edits include making unwanted photo objects vanish and adding creative
   sparkle to photos using pattern brushes.
   New this year is an option to create and order more than 140 items
   using photo prints from Fujifilm Prints and Gifts service (U.S. only),
   which is now built into Photoshop Elements.
   Premiere Elements 2020 has been updated with a Reduce Noise effect that
   makes videos more crisp, cutting down on noise in low light videos.
   There are also several new Guided Edits for creating time-lapse videos,
   replacing static skies with moving skies, and filling the frame to
   match the video (such as when a video is taken in portrait
   orientation).
   Also new to Premiere Elements is a Smart Tags feature for identifying
   the content in videos, and HEIF and HEVC support.
   For more on what's new in Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2020, make
   sure to check out Adobe's website. The updates are available for
   purchase from Adobe for $99 each starting today, with bundle and
   upgrade pricing available.

CloudApp for Mac Gains Collections, Favorites, an Updated Design and More

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:00 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   CloudApp, software designed for visual collaboration and content
   sharing, received a major update today to add new functionality to the
   app.
   The app has seen an overhauled interface that better matches macOS
   Catalina and iOS 13, Apple's newest operating systems. CloudApp for the
   Mac features larger interface elements and a streamlined design meant
   to improve the overall look and feel of the app.
   Collections and Favorites are also new additions, making it easier to
   share screen recordings, GIFs, videos, photos, and more with
   colleagues. Collections lets CloudApp users better organize their
   content, keeping it right at their fingertips for quick access. Users
   can create a Collection of commonly used files, get to those files
   right from a folder on the desktop, and easily share the content.
   CloudApp imagines multiple use cases for Collections. Customer service
   representatives, for example, can create a Collection of videos,
   screenshots, and GIFs for answering common customer questions, while
   marketing teams can keep design elements on hand.
   Favorites, meanwhile, are aimed at making it faster for CloudApp users
   to get to their most used Drops from the desktop. Favorites can be
   accessed from the new Favorites section, right next to Collections and
   Drops.
   CloudApp is also gaining new short links, doing away with the cl.ly
   short links in favor of share.getcloudapp.com links. CloudApp says
   these are more customer friendly, direct, and offer better security
   with SSL. Paid customers can continue to offer links with a customized
   domain.
   CloudApp can be downloaded from the CloudApp website. It's free for
   individual users and can be used to create and share videos, GIFs,
   screenshots, and more. The free plan is limited to 5 minutes of screen
   recording and 100MB of storage.
   Paid individual plans are available for $9 a month with unlimited video
   recording, and team plans are available for $8 per user per month.

Deals: 2019 27-Inch iMac Hits New Low Price, While Official iPhone 11 Pro
Leather Cases Get $9 Discount

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 7:51 AM PDT by Mitchel Broussard
   Today we're highlighting two new deals: one is a new low price on
   Apple's 27-inch iMac from Early 2019, and the other focuses on the
   first price drops we've seen for Apple's official Leather Cases for the
   iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.
   Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors. When you
   click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which
   helps us keep the site running.

27-Inch iMac

   You can get the 27-inch Retina iMac with a 3.7 GHz 6-core i5 processor,
   8GB RAM, and a 2TB Fusion Drive for $2,099.00, down from $2,299.00. At
   $200 off, this price is the lowest that we've tracked for this high-end
   model of the new 27-inch Retina iMac.
   Apple updated the iMac with 8th- and 9th-generation Intel processors in
   March 2019, also including faster memory and new Radeon Pro Vega
   graphics options. Be sure to head to Amazon soon to check out the new
   discount before it expires.

iPhone 11 Pro Leather Cases

   There are a few sales on the new official Apple Leather Case for the
   iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, which can be found at Amazon and Target.
   On Amazon, you can get the Leather Case in Saddle Brown for the iPhone
   11 Pro priced at $39.99, down from $49.00 ($9 off). Amazon isn't
   discounting the Leather Cases for the iPhone 11 Pro Max at the time of
   writing.
   Target has the Leather Case for the iPhone 11 Pro priced at $39.99,
   down from $49.00, in both Saddle Brown and Black. The retailer also has
   the Leather Case for the iPhone 11 Pro Max at the same price of $39.99
   ($9 off) in Saddle Brown and Black.
   Target customers can choose some items to be picked up at their local
   store, but if that is not an option you can opt for free two day
   shipping. If you have a Target Red Card, you can also save an
   additional 5 percent on the Leather Cases.
   Head to our full Deals Roundup for more information on the latest
   Apple-related discounts.

Apple to Announce Q4 2019 Earnings on October 30

   Monday September 30, 2019 4:51 PM PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today updated its investor relations page to announce that it
   will share its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter (third
   calendar quarter) of 2019 on Wednesday, October 30.
   The earnings results will offer up some insight into how well the
   iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Max did during their first week
   of availability, though Apple no longer breaks out iPhone unit sales so
   specific data won't be available.
   Apple's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 includes
   expected revenue of $61 to $64 billion and gross margin between 37.5
   and 38.5 percent. If on the higher end of the range, Apple's revenue
   will beat its Q4 2018 revenue of $62.9 billion.
   Guidance for the holiday quarter provided by Apple in its Q4 earnings
   results will give us the most insight into how the company's newest
   iPhones are selling.
   The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM
   Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report
   taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide
   coverage of both the earnings release and conference call on October
   30.

   Apple today seeded the tenth beta of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, one week after seeding the ninth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The new macOS Catalina beta can be downloaded using the Software Update
   mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper software
   from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

   Polanco on Friday, and Apple has shared some pictures that capture the
   excitement in and around the flagship retail store, located at Antara
   Fashion Hall in Cuidad.
   Apple Antara is the first Apple Store of its kind in Latin America,
   featuring a pavilion design with 23-foot-tall sliding glass doors.
   Inside, there is also a Forum and 8K Video Wall for Today at Apple
   sessions, nestled among indoor trees.
   Mexican illustrator Edgar Flores was in attendance, leading the store's
   first Today at Apple session and creating a communal art piece with
   participants.
   Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail and People,
   joined the team to welcome customers to Apple Antara, while Mexican R&B
   artist Mariana "Nan" de Miguel, aka Girl Ultra, performed on the
   opening night. Apple also created a special App Store story and Apple
   Music playlist to celebrate the opening.
   Over 100 new store team members have been employed at Apple Antara,
   which is now Apple's second retail store in Mexico City, after Apple
   Vía Santa Fe.

Hollywood Mac Pro Workstations Hit by Mysterious Software Issue [Updated]

   Tuesday September 24, 2019 2:34 AM PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Update: In a statement, AVID has indicated that the root cause for the
   reboot issue is unrelated to its creative tools. Google has since
   confirmed that a Chrome update "may have shipped with a bug that
   damages the file system on macOS machines" and has provided
   instructions for affected users.
   Original story follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Variety reports this morning of a possible computer virus attack or
   critical software failure affecting Mac Pro workstations across Los
   Angeles.
   According to social media chatter, Hollywood Film and TV editors
   discovered late on Monday that "trashcan" Mac Pros running older
   versions of macOS and AVID's Media Composer software were refusing to
   reboot after shutting down.
   The root cause of the issue remains unknown, but online speculation is
   surfacing a few possibilities, including a virus specifically targeting
   post-production Macs in the Hollywood area.
   Others have suggested an issue with AVID's iLok activation dongle, or
   perhaps a conflict with the software and a recent system update –
   possibly related to Apple's Safari browser – that is corrupting data.
   Affected users are being advised to try booting in single-user mode and
   disabling Wi-Fi so that they can back up, while non-affected AVID users
   have been told not to shut down their Macs so they can also deactivate
   Wi-Fi and any other networks until a solution is found.

     From what I gather there’s a massive failure of Macs with iLok/Avid
     that’s happening all over right now. A lot of L.A. post shops and
     people out on shows having their Macs slowly crash and wont boot
     again. Engineers are looking in to it. Don’t shut your machine off.
     #postchat
     — Matt Penn (@mattpenndotcom) September 24, 2019

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp
     — MarcusPun (@MarcusPun) September 24, 2019

   Several companies are said to have been affected by the issue. Neither
   AVID nor Apple have responded to requests for comment. This is a
   developing story that will be updated as soon as we learn more.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Beta 9 to Developers [Update: Public Beta

Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 92 With Bug Fixes and Performance
Improvements

   Wednesday September 18, 2019 10:39 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   safaripreviewicon safaripreviewicon Apple today released a new update
   for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first
   introduced three years ago in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari
   Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future
   release versions of Safari.
   Safari Technology Preview release 92 includes bug fixes and performance
   improvements for JavaScript, WebGPU, SVG, Images, Web API, Service
   Workers, WebRTC, IndexedDB, Web Inspector, Accessibility, and Security.
   The new Safari Technology Preview update is available for both macOS
   Mojave and MacOS Catalina, the newest version of the Mac operating
   system that was introduced at the June Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software
   Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the
   browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari
   Technology Preview website.
   Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from
   developers and users on its browser development process. Safari
   Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari
   browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a
   developer account to download.

Apple Says EU-Ireland Tax Order 'Defies Reality and Common Sense'

   Tuesday September 17, 2019 3:49 AM PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Apple on Tuesday argued that the European Union's order for it to pay
   13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in back taxes to Ireland "defies
   reality and common sense," as it kicked off its legal challenge against
   the ruling.
   According to Reuters, Apple also said the European Commission was using
   its powers "to retrofit changes to national law," which would create
   legal uncertainty for businesses.
   Apple sent a six-person delegation led by its CFO Luca Maestri to the
   two-day court hearing taking place over Tuesday and Wednesday in
   Luxembourg. The company is arguing the same case that CEO Tim Cook made
   in a public letter about the tax ruling three years ago; namely, that
   Apple follows the law and pays all the taxes it owes in every country
   where it operates, including Ireland.
   Apple also argues that nearly all of its research and development takes
   place in the United States, which is where the company pays the
   majority of its taxes.

     "The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple's profits
     from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two
     branches in Ireland," Apple's lawyer Daniel Beard told the court.
     He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple
     products and services and key intellectual property rights were
     developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws
     in the Commission's case.
     "The branches' activities did not involve creating, developing or
     managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary
     line defies reality and common sense," Beard said.
     "The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be
     responsible for generating almost all of Apple's profits outside the
     Americas."

   In 2016, the European Commission found Apple received illegal state aid
   from Ireland. Apple and Ireland both appealed the ruling, but the
   European Commission opened litigation against Ireland in October 2017
   for its failure to procure Apple's back taxes, and Apple has already
   almost finished paying the back taxes it owes. If the order is
   overturned, the money will be returned to Apple.

Deals Spotlight: Costco Discounts Apple's HomePod to $199.97 ($100 Off)

   Thursday October 3, 2019 9:13 am PDT by Mitchel Broussard
   Costco is offering Apple's HomePod for $199.97 today, which is about
   $100 off the regular price of $299.00. The retailer is only selling the
   Space Gray version of the HomePod, but those who place an order can
   expect the speaker to arrive within three to five business days (with
   an added $4.99 for shipping and handling).
   At $199.97, this is one of the lowest prices we've seen on the HomePod,
   and is a good chance for anyone looking to add more of Apple's smart
   speakers to their HomeKit setup. Of course, you'll need a Costco
   account to see the deal, which starts at $60/year. If you're a member,
   head to Costco today to browse the HomePod sale before it expires.
   Apple dropped the price of the HomePod from $349.00 to $299.00 in April
   2019. This price drop followed numerous discounts from well-known
   retailers like Target, Costco, and Best Buy, most of which began
   following a big discount on the HomePod during Black Friday 2018.

Apple Bans App That Allowed Hong Kong Protestors to Track Police Movements
[Update]

   Thursday October 3, 2019 4:03 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Apple has reportedly banned an app that allows Hong Kong protestors to
   track protests and police movements in the city state, despite
   increasing international condemnation against the violence used by the
   authorities.
   According to The Register, Apple has told the makers of the HKmap Live
   app that it can't be allowed in the App Store because it helps
   protestors to evade the police.

     "Your app contains content - or facilitates, enables, and encourages
     an activity - that is not legal ... specifically, the app allowed
     users to evade law enforcement," the American tech giant told makers
     of the HKmap Live on Tuesday before pulling it.

   Opposition to the Chinese state and the Hong Kong authorities has grown
   louder, driven by an escalation in violence against protestors over the
   past week. On Wednesday, thousands of people took to the streets of
   Hong Kong to denounce the shooting of an unarmed teenage student by
   police.
   Tsang Chi-kin was shot in the chest at point-blank range on Tuesday. He
   remains in hospital in stable but critical condition after surgery to
   remove the bullet, which narrowly missed his heart.
   The rise in police violence has led protesters to make use of digital
   networking and collaborative tools to organize street gatherings, with
   services like HKmap Live being used to help them avoid what they
   perceive as government-orchestrated attacks.
   This isn't the first time Apple has acted to remove apps from the App
   Store to abide by Chinese law. In July 2017, Apple removed the majority
   of VPN apps from the App Store in China, following regulations passed
   earlier in the year that require such apps to be authorized by the
   Chinese government.
   Update: Apple is reviewing its decision to reject HKmap Live, reports
   Bloomberg, and is likely investigating whether the software violates
   local laws. It's not yet clear if the app will be re-added to the App
   Store and the developer has not yet received an update from Apple
   following the commencement of the new review.

   topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion,
   Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to

Analyst Survey Suggests Most Netflix Users Don't Plan to Subscribe to Apple
TV+

   Thursday October 3, 2019 3:33 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Three-quarters of Netflix subscribers have no intention of subscribing
   to either Apple TV+ or Disney+ when they launch next month, according
   to surveys conducted by Piper Jaffray (via CNBC).
   According to the investment banker's survey of 1,500 Netflix
   subscribers, roughly 75 percent don't intend to subscribe to the
   upcoming rival streaming services, although those who do subscribe to
   Apple TV+ or Disney+ also expect to keep their Netflix subscription
   going.

     "Our survey suggests that the majority (~75%) of Netflix subscribers
     do not intend to subscribe to either Disney+ or Apple TV+. For those
     that do expect to use one of these offerings, the vast majority
     expect to also maintain their Netflix subscription," Piper Jaffray
     analyst Michael Olson said.
     "Most existing Netflix subscribers appear to be trending towards
     multiple streaming video subscriptions, especially as many continue
     to reduce their spend on traditional TV offerings," Olson said.

   The survey should provide some comfort for Netflix investors following
   news of slowing subscriber growth over the last three months, along
   with fears about the effect that the new streaming competition will
   have on the company's stock price.
   As CNBC's Michael Bloom notes, optimistic forecasts for Netflix were
   nearly universal on Wall Street as recently as July, but Netflix stock
   has since dropped nearly 30 percent and effectively wiped out its 2019
   gains.
   Amid the challenges, Netflix has been looking at new marketing
   strategies to help fend off its upcoming rivals. For example, the
   streaming leader has been offering non-subscribers access to the first
   episode of its new series, Bard of Blood, for a limited time.
   Apple TV+ launches on November 1, with Disney+ arriving a little over a
   week after, on November 12. Apple is offering a one-year free trial of
   Apple TV+ to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, or iPod
   touch.

Mario Kart Tour is Nintendo's Biggest Mobile Launch to Date With 90 Million
Downloads in First Week

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:23 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Nintendo's latest smartphone app Mario Kart Tour has been downloaded
   over 90 million times since it launched last week, according to new
   download estimates shared by Sensor Tower.
   The number eclipses both Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp and Super Mario
   Run, which were downloaded a respective 14.3 million times and just
   under 13 million times in their debut week, making Mario Kart Tour
   Nintendo's biggest mobile game launch to date.
   Breaking down the figure across platforms, the free-to-play game was
   downloaded 36.5 million times on iOS devices, while the Android version
   was downloaded 53.3 million times.
   In terms of overall revenue driven by in-app purchases, Mario Kart Tour
   earned $12.7 million, so it hasn't reached the heights of Fire Emblem
   Heroes, which earned Nintendo $28.2 million in its first week. Super
   Mario Run meanwhile clocked up $16.1 million in its debut week, making
   Mario Kart Tour the company's third-biggest game.
   Across platforms, $9.6 million (75.5 percent) was spent in-game by iOS
   device users, while Android IAPs amounted to $3.1 million (24.5
   percent). Most spending occurred in the U.S. with $5.8 million,
   followed by Japan ($4 million) and France ($752,000).
   Announced in January 2018, Mario Kart Tour was delayed several times
   before its debut last week. The game features an optional "Gold Pass"
   subscription, which introduces various in-game items and badges and
   also unlocks the faster 200cc mode. Nintendo is offering a two-week
   free trial, after which it costs $4.99 a month.
   Mario Kart Tour is a free download from the App Store, requires iOS 10
   or later to play, and officially supports iPhone 5s or iPad Air and
   later devices. A Nintendo Account is also required to play the game.

Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 13.2 Update to Developers [Update: Public Beta
Available]

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:08 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 13.2 update to
   developers for testing purposes, a little over one week after releasing
   the tvOS 13 update.
   Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV models, the new
   tvOS 13.2 developer beta can be downloaded onto the Apple TV via a
   profile that's installed using Xcode.
   tvOS updates (aside from major releases) have historically been minor
   in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather
   than major outward-facing changes. Apple provides little to no
   information on what's included in tvOS updates, so we may not discover
   anything new after installing the new beta.
   Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS updates, we let MacRumors
   readers know when new software is available so developers are able to
   download it upon release.
   If we find anything new in the tvOS 13.2 beta, we'll update this
   article.
   tvOS 13, released earlier in September, introduced multi-user support,
   a new Control Center, Apple Arcade and controller support, new
   screensavers and more.

Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 6.1 to Developers

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:05 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming watchOS 6.1 beta to
   developers, a little over a week after seeding the first watchOS 6.1
   beta and two weeks after releasing the watchOS 6 update with full App
   Store, new Apple Watch faces, and more.
   Once the proper configuration profile has been installed from the Apple
   Developer Center, the new watchOS beta can be downloaded through the
   dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General > Software
   Update.
   To install the update, the Apple Watch needs to have over 50 percent
   battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it has to be in range of
   the iPhone.
   There were no major changes found in the first watchOS 6.1 beta, so
   it's not entirely clear what's included in the update, but we'll update
   this article should new features be found in the second beta. The
   update may be focused on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance
   improvements.
   watchOS 6.1 does work with the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch
   models, which were excluded from the watchOS 6 release.
   Apple said that watchOS 6 would come to the older Apple Watch models at
   a later date, so it's possible watchOS 6.1 will be the first version of
   watchOS 6 to work with the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watches.

Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 93 With Bug Fixes and Performance
Improvements

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 9:59 am PDT by Juli Clover
   safaripreviewicon safaripreviewicon Apple today released a new update
   for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first
   introduced three years ago in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari
   Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future
   release versions of Safari.
   Safari Technology Preview release 93 includes bug fixes and performance
   improvements for Resource Timing, SVG, Web API, Web Inspector,
   Accessibility, Apple Pay, JavaScript, WebGPU, Web Authentication, and
   WebDriver.
   The new Safari Technology Preview update is available for both macOS
   Mojave and MacOS Catalina, the newest version of the Mac operating
   system that was introduced at the June Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software
   Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the
   browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari
   Technology Preview website.
   Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from
   developers and users on its browser development process. Safari
   Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari
   browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a
   developer account to download.

'Black Panther' Star Winston Duke to Star in Apple's 'Swagger' TV Series

   Tuesday October 1, 2019 11:33 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Winston Duke, known for his role M'Baku in "Black Panther," is set to
   star in Apple's upcoming TV series "Swagger," reports Variety.
   Duke will play Ike, a youth basketball coach who used to be a star
   player. Production on the show is set to begin in October, more than a
   year after Apple first picked up the series.

                           Image via Winston Duke

   "Swagger," which is based on NBA star Kevin Durant's youth basketball
   experiences, is said to explore the world of youth basketball, the
   players, their families, and their coaches.
   "Swagger" is one of the TV shows that Apple is developing for its Apple
   TV+ streaming service, which is set to launch in November. As
   production is first starting, "Swagger" won't be available at launch
   and will instead be a show premiering at a later date.
   Apple TV+ will cost $4.99 per month for up to six family members, and
   Apple is offering a free one-year subscription to customers who
   purchase an Apple TV, Mac, iPad, or iPhone.

Halide Camera for iOS Gains Support for iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro

   Monday September 30, 2019 1:11 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Halide, a popular camera app designed for iOS devices, was today
   updated with support for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, with the
   company adding new features able to take advantage of the hardware in
   the new devices.
   There's a faster lens switcher that uses Haptic Touch to switch between
   the two focal lengths in the iPhone 11 (wide and ultra wide) and the
   three focal lengths in the iPhone 11 Pro (wide, ultra wide, and
   telephoto). Halide's developers say it's quicker, smoother and more
   intuitive than the standard lens switcher.
   On the iPhone 11 Pro, there's a new Lens Guides feature designed to
   help users compose shots. The Lens Guides appear when the lens switcher
   tool is opened, providing overlays of what a shot would look like using
   a different focal length.
   There are no manual focus controls for the ultra wide-angle camera in
   Halide, and that's because the lens has a fixed focus. The ultra
   wide-angle camera is not capable of RAW output, nor does Apple's
   outside the frame feature work with RAW. Halide hasn't added outside
   the frame functionality at this time.
   Smart RAW has been updated for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, with the exposure
   engine tuned to produce RAW shots with less noise. Smart RAW
   improvement for the new iPhones is an ongoing product though, with
   Halide planning to add additional refinements in the future.
   For older iPhones, the new version of Halide includes bug fixes and
   enhancements, along with RAW exposure improvements for all Smart RAW
   iPhones.
   Halide can be downloaded from the App Store for $5.99. [Direct Link]

   with either light or dark themes on iPhones and iPads. For all of the

   documents side by side, or two Numbers spreadsheets.
   Custom fonts are now supported, screenshots of entire documents can be
   captured, and files can be accessed from a USB drive, external hard
   drive, or file server. Additional changes are outlined in the release
   notes for each app below.
   Pages Release Notes:

     - Enable Dark Mode to emphasize your content.*
     - On iPadOS, use Pages in multiple spaces or edit two documents side
     by side in Split View.
     - Support for new iOS 13 and iPadOS text editing and navigation
     gestures.*
     - Set the default font and font size used for all new documents
     created from basic templates.
     - Use custom fonts installed from the App Store.*
     - Capture a screenshot of an entire document, mark it up, then
     easily share it as a PDF.*

       iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.

Apple Reportedly Increasing iPhone 11 Lineup Production by Up to 10% Due to
Strong Demand

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:14 pm PDT by Eric Slivka
   Apple has asked suppliers to increase production of its new iPhone 11
   and iPhone 11 Pro lineup by up to 10 percent, according to Nikkei Asian
   Review. The bump in production would add up to 8 million units to the
   current production plans as Apple seeks to meet stronger-than-expected
   demand.

     "This autumn is so far much busier than we expected," one source
     with direct knowledge of the situation said. "Previously, Apple was
     quite conservative about placing orders," which were less than for
     last year's new iPhone. "After the increase, prepared production
     volume for the iPhone 11 series will be higher compared to last
     year," the source said.

   The report claims the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are seeing the
   strongest demand, while Apple is actually revising orders for the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max down slightly as it seeks to balance production with
   demand.
   Nearly every year, stories circulate about Apple cutting production in
   the months following the launches of new iPhones, but it's frequently
   unclear whether production cuts are due to weaker-than-expected demand
   or simply anticipated scaling back following the initial rush of
   orders. Regardless, an increase in production this year appears to be a
   good sign for Apple.
   With the launch of three new iPhone models with improved cameras,
   Apple's iPhone lineup may be appealing to a broad array of customers
   ready to upgrade from older models, particularly with the iPhone 11
   starting at $699, which is $50 less than its iPhone XR predecessor.
   Those looking for an even more budget-friendly new iPhone may have some
   welcome news early next year, with multiple reliable sources indicating
   that Apple is planning to launch a new "iPhone SE 2" that would
   actually look very similar to the iPhone 8 but with upgraded internals
   such as Apple's latest A13 chip and 3 GB of RAM.

   Wrong !
   The 15% iPhone Tariff hits on Dec 15th, & Apple needs to get as many
   2019 iPhones as possible into the Sales Channel BEFORE then !!!
   The units need to clear customs & NOT be in a Warehouse !
   Two are the two main criteria, else they will get hit with the 15%
   tariff (starting on Dec 15th).
   NOT a single so-called Pro Stock Analyst who covers AAPL for a living
   has yet picked up on this, NOR even a single Regular on CNBC !

   was actually interested in the 11 pro max but the price in singapore is
   2k for a 256gb model and 1.7k for a 64gb.
   sorry but unless this phone can make me breakfast and wipe my ass, it
   is not worth 2k. not just the iphone, no phone is worth 2k.
   for comparison, 2k can get me an asus zenbook with change for a 2019
   ipad.
   or a surface pro 6/7 with change for a 2019 ipad.
   or a new pc with a 2070ti on AMD zen 2 with 16gb ram, 1tb ssd and a
   144hz gaming monitor.
   or 4 boxes of cuban cigars.
   or 17 bottles of whisky.
   or 13 bottles of quality cognac.
   or stock up my entire bar.
   or get drunk and die of liver failure in 1 night.
   these would all be more viable choices than spending it all on a phone.

   The tariffs haven't come out of the blue. It's been known for a long
   time. They wouldn't have waited until now, several weeks after launch,
   to up production, if what you are suggesting was true.
   Edit: I too am seeing a lot of people lined up at the stores here to
   get one. Frankly, I'm quite surprised. All I was hearing was what a dud
   this year would be. Guess thats what I get when I come on MacRumors and
   read all the negativity and believe some of it.

   I think everyone assumes all people upgrading are on the most recent

   by the 11, all I got to say is: well duh!! But for those with a 7 or
   older, this is one hell of an upgrade
   Most of the iPhone 6,6s,7 buyer isn't looking forward to replacing its
   device with a notch screen.

   Wrong !
   The 15% iPhone Tariff hits on Dec 15th, & Apple needs to get as many
   2019 iPhones as possible into the Sales Channel BEFORE then !!!
   The units need to clear customs & NOT be in a Warehouse !
   Two are the two main criteria, else they will get hit with the 15%
   tariff (starting on Dec 15th).
   NOT a single so-called Pro Stock Analyst who covers AAPL for a living
   has yet picked up on this, NOR even a single Regular on CNBC !
   A Fool & his Money are soon parted !
   So, what are you saying is "wrong" here? It's not clear.
   Greater than expected demand - is that what you think is wrong?
   I think you may have pointed out something about tariffs - possibly,
   but it seems like you are saying that there is no "greater than
   expected demand" - and I was wondering how you know that, or even if
   that's what your assuming and implying.
   Someone can just as easily say that you are wrong.
   PS - I agree CNBC and all the lame analysts talk jive. Is it the same
   jive as you though? Bias causes a lot of people to push fake ideas on
   others.

   Underwhelming for who and who? Perhaps for those who own last year’s
   device (even that you cannot be sure), but there are many more
   upgrading quite older handsets. Again, who are the “most of the buyers”
   who plan or returning theirs? You must be some kind of wizard.
   I think everyone assumes all people upgrading are on the most recent
   phones or something. If you have an xs max and aren’t super impressed
   by the 11, all I got to say is: well duh!! But for those with a 7 or
   older, this is one hell of an upgrade

   The iPhone 11 lineup is underwhelming and most of the buyers plan on
   returning it.

   Hello there
   Anyone knows how long does it take to manufacture an iPhone and to hit
   the shelves? Is it 2 weeks or one month?
   We have a lot of unavalbility here. I am still waiting a few more weeks
   before buying a 11 Pro: I can see a lot of issues with iOS 13.x so
   maybe iOS 13.2 or 13.3 will fix everything.
   There has been so many issues with the software and such lately I would
   wait a bit before upgrading. My reminders don’t even work right now
   after 3 bug fix updates. This is crazy.
   you can never feel bad waiting it out. I’d wait until next month at
   least

Apple Shares Details on Cleaning and Protecting Your Apple Card in New
Support Document

   Wednesday August 21, 2019 2:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple this morning shared a new Apple Card support document, which
   covers proper cleaning and storage methods to maintain the card's
   signature white finish.
   If the Apple Card gets dirty, Apple recommends gently wiping it with a
   soft, damp microfiber cloth. A soft microfiber cloth moistened with
   isopropyl alcohol can also be used for stain removal.
   Apple says that household cleaners, abrasives, solvents, ammonia,
   aerosol sprays and compressed air must be avoided, and warns that some
   fabrics, such as leather and denim, have the potential to cause
   permanent discoloration.
   Due to the multi-layer coating process that gives the titanium card its
   white finish, Apple has detailed rules for proper storage.
   The Apple Card should be stored in a wallet, pocket, or bag constructed
   from soft materials, and it should not touch another credit card
   because doing so could cause scratching.
   Apple also warns against putting the Apple Card near magnets because
   doing so could cause the magnetic strip to become demagnetized, and
   Apple also says that the Apple Card should not be put in a pocket or
   bag that contains loose change, keys, or other potentially abrasive
   objects.
   Apple's full list of instructions for the Apple Card can be found in
   the support document. Additional Apple Card details are located in our
   Apple Card guide.

Apple Shares Another Teaser for M. Night Shyamalan Apple TV+ Series 'Servant'

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today shared a new teaser trailer for its upcoming TV show
   "Servant," which is a psychological thriller created by Tony Basgallop
   and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan.
   The series is said to follow a Philadelphia couple (played by Tony
   Kebbell and Lauren Ambrose) who hire a young nanny named Leanne (Nell
   Tiger Free) to care for their newborn child, who, based on the
   trailers, appears to be a fake baby.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/lnYIcec-Ofk

   The new teaser trailer is one of three that Apple has shown so far,
   with the others previewed during the Emmy Awards in September.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/yVOB045BZDs

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/__-M5gA3pIU

   Servant will not be available when Apple TV+ launches on November 1,
   but it will be coming out soon after on November 28. Apple TV+ will be
   priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple is offering a free subscription to
   customers who purchase an Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
   At launch, Apple TV+ will offer several TV shows, including
   "Dickinson," "For All Mankind," "Helpsters," "Ghostwriter," and "The
   Morning Show."

Tim Cook Talks Cryptocurrency, Quality Journalism, Privacy and More on
European Tour

   Thursday October 3, 2019 5:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently in Europe, and over the course of the
   last few days, he's visited Germany, France, and Italy. Earlier this
   week we shared an interview he did with a German news site, and today
   he spoke with a French newspaper and students in Italy as part of an
   appearance at the Osservatorio Permanente.
   Cook commented on topics like journalism, privacy, and immigration,
   with his comments shared by Italian site Macitynet.it [Google
   Translate] and French newspaper Les Echoes (via CNBC).

                     Image shared by Tim Cook on Twitter

   According to Cook, while the internet has brought "many positive
   things," fake news is one negative. From a translation of the original
   interview:

     All of us lovers of democracy and freedom must think that separating
     the false from the true is the basis of freedom. Quality journalism
     is the foundation of every democracy and an open and free press is
     essential.

   Cook also spoke about a topic that he's covered many times in the past
   - privacy. He reiterated his belief that Apple customers are not
   Apple's product, and that Apple will not sell customer data. "At Apple,
   we will never treat you as products but as customers with dignity and
   respect," he said.
   Along with touching on privacy, Cook highlighted Apple's environmental
   efforts, such as the fact that Apple is run on 100 percent renewable
   energy, and he spoke on human rights. "We do not do it because it's
   required by regulations, but because it is a moral imperative," he
   said.
   Apple supports immigration because wealthy countries must "accept
   migrants who are fleeing difficult situations," said Cook. Cook added
   that he would like for young people and children to be able to stay in
   the United States to study, referencing his support for DACA, or the
   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy.
   Cook had advice for students regarding smartphone usage. "Smartphones
   must bring you closer to those who are far away - don't leave those
   close to you," he said. "If you spend more time looking at your
   smartphones than people's eyes, you're wrong."
   Cook also spoke about cryptocurrency according to CNBC, with statements
   originally shared by French site Les Echoes. Cook said that currency
   should stay in the hands of countries, and private companies should not
   look to gain power with cryptocurrency.

     "No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of
     countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group
     setting up a competing currency," he said.
     "A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way."

   Apple's vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey recently said that
   Apple is "watching" cryptocurrency in regards to potentially supporting
   it in the future, but said that the company is primarily focused on
   what consumers are using today.
   Cook's comments come three months after Facebook announced plans to
   launch a new digital currency called Libra next year in partnership
   with companies like Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, and Stripe.
   Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this
   topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion,
   Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to
   read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members
   with at least 100 posts.

Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:59 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple may have recently acquired UK-based motion capture company
   IKinema, based on evidence from company filings and information shared
   by a MacRumors reader.
   IKinema offers animation technology that's used for games, virtual
   reality, and more. Earlier this year, for example, IKinema partnered
   with Ubisoft for IKinema's RunTime software for character creation.
   IKinema specialized in technology that allowed for real-time motion
   animation of virtual characters.

     IKINEMA's technology is embraced by development teams the world over
     to bring their games to life through delivery of high fidelity
     results in natural character locomotion and greater player immersion
     within dynamic game worlds, including substantial cost reduction and
     accelerated production levels by a factor of five times or more to
     expedite the release of games to market.

   Based on details from IKinema's mostly defunct website, the company
   considers itself a specialist in real-time procedural animation and
   whole body solving technology. IKinema has several videos on YouTube
   showing off its technology creating animated characters from real-life
   people, dogs, and more.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/849vDheMyXs

   According to a document filed with the UK government, Apple lawyer
   Peter Denwood, who handles Apple's international affairs, was named the
   director of IKinema on September 12, 2019, with his address listed as
   One Apple Park Way.
   The address of the company was also updated to 100 New Bridge Street in
   London on September 26, which is the address for Apple Europe Limited.
   The IKinema website is no longer functional with the exception of a few
   technical documents, and the company's Twitter and Facebook accounts
   stopped being updated on August 19. MacRumors reader Peter, who is in
   the industry, told MacRumors that IKinema customers have been left in
   the dark "for weeks" and that the acquisition was confirmed in a
   private Facebook Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Golden Master to Developers

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:07 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the golden master version of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, three days after seeding the tenth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The golden master version of macOS Catalina represents the final
   version of the update that will be provided to the public at release.
   The new macOS Catalina software can be downloaded using the Software
   Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper
   profile from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

Kuo: Apple to Launch 'iPhone SE 2' in Early 2020 With Similar Design as
iPhone 8, A13 Chip, and 3GB RAM

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:27 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple plans to release a lower-priced "iPhone SE 2" in the first
   quarter of 2020, according to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
   In a research note with TF International Securities, obtained by
   MacRumors, Kuo said the device will feature a similar form factor
   design and specifications as the iPhone 8, with a faster A13 chip and
   3GB of RAM:

     We forecast that Apple will launch the more affordable iPhone SE2 in
     1Q20. For the most part, the form factor design and hardware spec
     are similar to iPhone 8's. The most significant hardware spec
     upgrade will be the adoption of the A13 processor and 3GB LPDDR4X.
     iPhone SE2 will likely increase iPhone's market share and benefit
     Apple's promotions for service and content. We expect that the
     iPhone SE2 shipment will reach 30–40mn units in 2020.

   Kuo believes the "iPhone SE 2" will be the "best upgrade choice" for an
   estimated 100 million remaining iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users,
   serving as a "key growth driver" for Apple in 2020. He believes these
   customers have low desire for new features like Face ID and multiple
   cameras, suggesting the "iPhone SE 2" will stick with Touch ID and a
   single-lens rear camera.
   Kuo's prediction lines up with multiple other sources that have claimed
   Apple plans to release a new lower-cost iPhone 8-esque device next
   year, including the Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, Japanese
   publication Nikkei Asian Review, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby
   Wu.
   Those earlier reports indicated the device will sport a 4.7-inch
   display and a Touch ID home button like the iPhone 8. Apple continues
   to sell the iPhone 8 from $449, while the iPhone SE was $349 prior to
   being discontinued. When new, the iPhone 8 and iPhone SE started at
   $699 and $399 respectively.

Apple Supplier Epistar Says Clients Are Working on Mini-LED Products Amid
Rumors of Mini-LED iPad and MacBook

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:19 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Epistar president Chin-Yung Fan said his company's clients are
   developing notebooks, tablets, smartphones, and monitors with Mini-LED
   backlighting systems, which will naturally boost demand for Mini-LEDs
   in the second half of 2020, according to Taiwanese industry publication
   DigiTimes.
   Epistar is an Apple supplier, leading to the possibility that the
   iPhone maker is one of the unnamed clients working on Mini-LED
   products, as previously rumored, but Epistar declined to comment on any
   specific clients.
   Last week, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of investor firm TF
   International Securities said Apple plans to release an iPad with a
   Mini-LED display between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first
   quarter of 2021, followed by a MacBook with a Mini-LED display in the
   first or second quarter of 2021.
   Kuo said Epistar will be one of Apple's suppliers for those iPad and
   MacBook models. Epistar is the largest LED manufacturer in Taiwan.
   Kuo expects the iPad and MacBook to be positioned at the high end of
   their respective product lines due to costly Mini-LED display
   components, suggesting they will be iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models. He
   previously said the iPad will have a 10-12 inch screen and the MacBook
   will fall in the 15-17 inch range.
   Kuo added that the Mini-LED backlit displays will allow for thinner and
   lighter product designs, while offering many of the same benefits of
   OLED displays used on the latest iPhones, including good wide color
   gamut performance, high contrast and dynamic range, and local dimming
   for truer blacks.
   The future iPad and MacBook displays will each use approximately 10,000
   LEDs, compared to 576 in Apple's upcoming Pro Display XDR, according to
   Kuo. Each LED is said to be very small — below 200 microns in size.
   Apple continues to use traditional LCDs across its entire iPad and Mac
   lineups for now, but if this rumor proves to be accurate, we can expect
   the first Mini-LED models within the next 12 to 18 months or so. Prices
   will likely start on the higher side, but the technology should shuffle
   its way down the lineup over the years.

Microsoft Debuts New Dual-Screen Devices, Updated Surface Laptops and More

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 1:46 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Microsoft today held an event in New York City to show off both new
   Surface devices and some new dual screen devices that are coming in the
   future.
   MacRumors videographer Dan was in attendance at the event and was able
   to capture some footage of the newly announced products for an overview
   that can be watched over on our YouTube channel.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/UP0ARbs3a_k

         Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

   Microsoft's most exciting unveil was the Surface Neo and the Surface
   Duo, two foldable dual display devices. The Neo is tablet sized while
   the Duo is phone sized, and both have two displays that aren't
   connected together into one display but are instead displayed side by
   side with a hinge.
   The Surface Neo features two nine inch displays that can fold out into
   a larger 13-inch form factor, while the Duo has two 5.6-inch displays
   that fold out into an 8.3-inch tablet.
   You can hold these devices like a book, using one side for one app and
   the other side for another app, or you can fold them up into a more
   traditional form factor. They can also be unfolded into a laptop shape
   if desired.
   The Surface Neo (the larger of the two) has a detachable Bluetooth
   keyboard and a Wonder Bar that's similar to the Touch Bar on Apple's
   laptops but larger and with more functionality.
   Windows 10X, new custom software based on Windows 10 but designed for
   dual displays runs on the Neo, while the Duo, which is in fact
   Microsoft's first smartphone since the Windows Phone in 2017, runs a
   heavily skinned version of Android.
   These two devices were by far the most interesting devices Microsoft
   had to show off, but unfortunately, they're not launching until the
   holiday season in 2020 and Microsoft didn't even have prototypes
   available for attendees to test out.
   As for what's available now, Microsoft overhauled its Surface lineup.
   The new Surface Pro X, designed to compete with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro,
   features a 13-inch display and it's super slim and light. It has a
   cover that integrates with a new Surface Slim Pen, and there's an SSD
   that's user accessible.
   The Surface Pro X features an SQ1 processor, LTE connectivity, 13 hours
   of battery life, and 2 USB-C ports. It's priced starting at $999 and
   will be available in early November.
   Microsoft also unveiled a new version of its Surface Laptop 3, which
   comes in new colors and finishes, has a larger trackpad, and is
   equipped with a USB-C port. There's a standard 13-inch model and a new
   larger 15-inch model that uses AMD Ryzen Surface Edition chips.
   Pricing on the Surface Laptop 3 starts at $999 for the 13-inch model
   and $1199 for the 15-inch model, with Microsoft planning to release
   both later this month.
   Microsoft's final product of note is the new Surface Earbuds, which are
   wire-free earbuds that are designed to compete with Apple's AirPods.
   The Surface Earbuds have an unusual look, with an in-ear piece that
   fits into the ear and a circular disk that's quite large and sits in
   the outer part of the ear.
   The disk supports gestures for controlling playback and live
   transcription for communicating across multiple languages. Microsoft is
   charging $249 for its Surface Earbuds, and they'll be available later
   in the year.

Apple's Tim Cook and Deirdre O'Brien Urge Supreme Court to Protect Dreamers
by Upholding DACA

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 1:00 pm PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple today filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in
   support of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration
   policy. Apple has filed many briefs before the Court, but this is the
   first time that Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Vice President of Retail and
   People Deirdre O'Brien are named too.
   DACA provides around 800,000 individuals who entered the U.S. at age 16
   or younger with a renewable two-year period of deferred action from
   deportation, and eligibility for a work permit in the country. Many of
   these individuals, known as Dreamers, have lived in the U.S. for the
   majority of their lives.
   In its brief, Apple notes that it employs 443 Dreamers who come from
   more than 25 different countries spanning four continents. Dreamers at
   Apple run the gamut of roles within the company, including hardware
   engineering, software engineering, retail, customer support, and
   operations across 36 states.
   Apple says it would "quite literally not exist without a brilliant and
   driven population of immigrants," including Dreamers, adding that Apple
   co-founder Steve Jobs's father immigrated from Syria himself. Apple
   also mentions several studies that link a diverse workforce to a
   company's growth and success.
   The introduction of Apple's brief:

     Since 1976, Apple has made its name by designing, developing,
     selling, and maintaining cutting-edge consumer electronics including
     mobile communications devices, personal computers, and related
     software and services. Apple's success stems from its people. They
     shape and embody Apple's culture of innovation. Apple employs a
     diverse workforce of over 90,000 employees in the United States
     alone.
     Among those people are hundreds of DACA recipients who had no say in
     the decision to travel to this country and have known no other home.
     Apple employs DACA recipients who embody Apple's commitment to
     innovation in a wide variety of positions. As we explain below,
     they, and immigrants like them, are vital to Apple's success. They
     spark creativity and help drive innovation. They are among our most
     driven and selfless colleagues.

   And the conclusion:

     This is an issue where one's head and heart lead to the same
     conclusion. We collectively owe it to the Dreamers to hold up our
     end of the bargain. It is not just a legal requirement. It is the
     moral thing to do. Who are we as a country if we renege? What does
     it say about us as a people to turn our backs on the Dreamers now?

   The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the legality of DACA during its
   2019 term, which begins Monday, October 7.
   Apple's full amicus brief is embedded below.

What's New in iOS 13.2 Beta 1: Announce Messages With Siri, HomePod Handoff
and More

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 12:07 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Along with Deep Fusion for the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models,
   the iOS 13.2 developer beta that Apple released today also includes a
   few other major changes and updates that are worth noting.
   Below, we've rounded up all of the changes that we've found in iOS 13.2
   so far.
   - Announce Messages With Siri - The feature that's designed to allow
   Siri to announce incoming messages has been reenabled in iOS 13.2, and
   can be turned on by going to Settings > Siri > Search and toggling on
   Announce Messages.
   - Research Privacy Settings - iOS 13.2 has a new Research option in the
   Privacy section of the Settings app, which is for Apple's upcoming
   Research app. The Research app is not yet available, but the presence
   of the setting in iOS 13.2 suggests it may come when iOS 13.2 is
   released.
   - AirPlay & Handoff - The Handoff section of the Settings app (under
   General) is now AirPlay & Handoff with a new "Transfer to HomePod"
   option and an option to turn off automatic AirPlay to TVs.
   - Volume in Control Center - When you have AirPods, Beats Pro, BeatsX,
   or other Beats headphones connected to your iPhone or iPad, the volume
   control bar in Control Center will display an appropriate icon.
   - HomeKit Grouping - In the HomeKit app, there's a new option to group
   or ungroup accessories that have multiple functions, showing them
   either as a single tile or as multiple tiles. Multiple tiles was the
   pre-iOS 13 default, while Single Tile is the iOS 13 default.
   - New AirPods - As we reported earlier today, the iOS 13.2 beta
   contains images that unveil an upcoming AirPods design for the
   third-generation AirPods, which are rumored to have active noise
   canceling functionality.
   Know of a feature that's new in iOS 13.2 that we left out? Make sure to
   let us know in the comments and we'll update this article.

iOS 13.2 Beta Includes Icon Depicting New AirPods Design

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 11:32 am PDT by Steve Moser
   Apple has been rumored to be working on a third generation of AirPods
   with active noise control (ANC), also known as noise cancellation, or
   active noise reduction (ANR). Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested
   the updated AirPods could launch late this year or early next year with
   an "all-new design."
   Today's iOS 13.2 beta release includes an icon showing redesigned
   AirPods that appear to have rubber ear tips that would likely be needed
   as part of a noise cancelation feature.
   The file name includes reference to a B298 code name, and the image is
   contained in the Accessibility Settings folder. This could suggest
   these new AirPods will contain a new accessibility feature such as
   being able to use them as hearing aids, or it could be related to
   existing Live Listen capabilities.
   There's no specific word on when the new AirPods could debut, but Apple
   has a number of rumored pending announcements that could point toward
   an October media event.
   Update 11:55 AM: As noted by a MacRumors reader, a claimed photo leak
   last month from 52 Audio bears a strong resemblance to the image found
   in iOS 13.2, suggesting the leak may be accurate.

Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 to Developers With Deep
Fusion for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro [Update: Public Beta Available]

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:03 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today released the first betas of upcoming iOS and iPadOS 13.2
   updates to developers, just a week after the release of iOS 13.1 and
   two weeks after the iOS 13 update first debuted.
   iOS and iPadOS 13.2 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer
   Center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been
   installed.
   As announced yesterday, the iOS 13.2 update introduces Deep Fusion for
   the cameras in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models. Deep Fusion is a
   new image processing system that uses the A13 Bionic and the Neural
   Engine. Deep Fusion takes advantage of machine learning techniques to
   do pixel-by-pixel processing of photos, optimizing for texture,
   details, and noise in each part of the image.
   The feature is aimed at improving indoor photos and photos taken in
   medium lighting, and it's a feature that will automatically activate
   based on the lens being used and the light level in the room.
   Today's update also reintroduces the Announce with Siri feature for
   Messages, brings new Privacy controls for Apple's upcoming research
   app, and it even leaked an upcoming AirPods design. For a list of
   everything new in iOS 13.2, make sure to check out our article
   outlining the new features.
   Update: Apple has also seeded the iOS and iPadOS 13.2 betas to its
   public beta testing group.

       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.

Apple Asks Devs to Submit macOS Catalina Apps to Mac App Store, Reminds About
Notarization Requirements

   Thursday October 3, 2019 1:13 PM PDT by Juli Clover
   Ahead of the launch of macOS Catalina, which Apple says will "soon be
   available," Apple is asking developers to submit Mac apps compatible
   with Catalina to the Mac App Store.
   Apple encourages developers to take advantage of macOS Catalina
   technologies like Sign in with Apple, Sidecar, Core ML 3, and Metal.
   Apple also highlights Mac Catalyst, designed to bring iPad apps to the
   Mac.

     macOS Catalina will soon be available to hundreds of millions of
     users around the world. With macOS Catalina, your Mac apps can take
     advantage of Sign in with Apple, Sidecar, and the latest advances in
     Core ML 3, and Metal. And with Mac Catalyst, you can bring your iPad
     apps to Mac. Build your apps using Xcode 11, test them on a Mac
     computer running the macOS Catalina GM seed, and submit them for
     review.

   Separately, for apps that are designed to be distributed outside of the
   Mac App Store, Apple has reminded developers of a new notarization
   requirement.
   Apple is requiring apps that are distributed outside of the Mac App
   Store to be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina. First
   introduced in macOS Mojave, the notarization process is aimed at
   protecting Mac users from malicious and harmful apps.

     To further protect users on macOS Catalina, we're working with
     developers to make sure all software, whether distributed on the App
     Store or outside of it, is signed or notarized by Apple. This will
     give users more confidence that the software they download and run,
     no matter where they get it from, has been checked for known
     security issues.
     In June, we announced that all Mac software distributed outside the
     Mac App Store must be notarized by Apple in order to run by default
     on macOS Catalina. Make sure to test all versions of your software
     on the macOS Catalina GM seed and submit it to Apple to be
     notarized.

   For notarization, Apple offers trusted non Mac App Store developers
   Developer IDs that are required to allow the Gatekeeper function on
   macOS to install non Mac App Store apps.
   Notarization is not required for apps that are distributed through the
   Mac App Store, and Apple recently relaxed its notarization rules,
   giving developers until January 2020 to comply.
   Apple today released the golden master version of macOS Catalina to
   developers, which represents the final version of the software that
   will be provided to the public.
   It's still not known when macOS Catalina will launch, but it could be
   as early as tomorrow based on previously leaked info from Apple's
   Danish site.

Adobe Launches Premiere and Photoshop Elements 2020

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   Adobe today released updated versions of Photoshop Elements and
   Premiere Elements, the company's affordable photo and video editing
   software aimed at casual users who want to improve their photos and
   videos with simple editing tools.
   Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2020 feature updated Adobe Sensei AI
   technology, new guided edits for walking users through various features
   within each app, and updated ways to share content.
   Since the 2019 version, opening up the Home Screen in Photoshop and
   Premiere Elements has shown automatically generated photo and video
   slideshows with different effects powered by Adobe Sensei.
   In 2020, there are new effects like Black and White Selection, Pattern
   Brush for overlaying patterns on photos, Painterly for interesting
   masking and crops, and Depth of Field for blurring backgrounds to bring
   out subjects.
   Photoshop Elements has new editing features that users can take
   advantage of for quick but powerful edits. There's an option that will
   automatically colorize black and white photos or tweak the colors in an
   existing color photo.
   With one-click subject selection, users can select the subject of a
   photo with a click and then apply an effect or cut out a subject to put
   it in another photo.
   There's a new skin smoothing feature that will automatically smooth and
   refine the skin of a subject in a photo using Adobe Sensei technology,
   and Adobe has added several new Guided Edits (aka tutorials). Guided
   Edits include making unwanted photo objects vanish and adding creative
   sparkle to photos using pattern brushes.
   New this year is an option to create and order more than 140 items
   using photo prints from Fujifilm Prints and Gifts service (U.S. only),
   which is now built into Photoshop Elements.
   Premiere Elements 2020 has been updated with a Reduce Noise effect that
   makes videos more crisp, cutting down on noise in low light videos.
   There are also several new Guided Edits for creating time-lapse videos,
   replacing static skies with moving skies, and filling the frame to
   match the video (such as when a video is taken in portrait
   orientation).
   Also new to Premiere Elements is a Smart Tags feature for identifying
   the content in videos, and HEIF and HEVC support.
   For more on what's new in Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2020, make
   sure to check out Adobe's website. The updates are available for
   purchase from Adobe for $99 each starting today, with bundle and
   upgrade pricing available.

CloudApp for Mac Gains Collections, Favorites, an Updated Design and More

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:00 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   CloudApp, software designed for visual collaboration and content
   sharing, received a major update today to add new functionality to the
   app.
   The app has seen an overhauled interface that better matches macOS
   Catalina and iOS 13, Apple's newest operating systems. CloudApp for the
   Mac features larger interface elements and a streamlined design meant
   to improve the overall look and feel of the app.
   Collections and Favorites are also new additions, making it easier to
   share screen recordings, GIFs, videos, photos, and more with
   colleagues. Collections lets CloudApp users better organize their
   content, keeping it right at their fingertips for quick access. Users
   can create a Collection of commonly used files, get to those files
   right from a folder on the desktop, and easily share the content.
   CloudApp imagines multiple use cases for Collections. Customer service
   representatives, for example, can create a Collection of videos,
   screenshots, and GIFs for answering common customer questions, while
   marketing teams can keep design elements on hand.
   Favorites, meanwhile, are aimed at making it faster for CloudApp users
   to get to their most used Drops from the desktop. Favorites can be
   accessed from the new Favorites section, right next to Collections and
   Drops.
   CloudApp is also gaining new short links, doing away with the cl.ly
   short links in favor of share.getcloudapp.com links. CloudApp says
   these are more customer friendly, direct, and offer better security
   with SSL. Paid customers can continue to offer links with a customized
   domain.
   CloudApp can be downloaded from the CloudApp website. It's free for
   individual users and can be used to create and share videos, GIFs,
   screenshots, and more. The free plan is limited to 5 minutes of screen
   recording and 100MB of storage.
   Paid individual plans are available for $9 a month with unlimited video
   recording, and team plans are available for $8 per user per month.

   Monday September 30, 2019 4:51 PM PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today updated its investor relations page to announce that it
   will share its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter (third
   calendar quarter) of 2019 on Wednesday, October 30.
   The earnings results will offer up some insight into how well the
   iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Max did during their first week
   of availability, though Apple no longer breaks out iPhone unit sales so
   specific data won't be available.
   Apple's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 includes
   expected revenue of $61 to $64 billion and gross margin between 37.5
   and 38.5 percent. If on the higher end of the range, Apple's revenue
   will beat its Q4 2018 revenue of $62.9 billion.
   Guidance for the holiday quarter provided by Apple in its Q4 earnings
   results will give us the most insight into how the company's newest
   iPhones are selling.
   The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM

   taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide

   30.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Beta 10 to Developers [Update: Public Beta
Available]

   Monday September 30, 2019 10:12 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the tenth beta of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, one week after seeding the ninth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The new macOS Catalina beta can be downloaded using the Software Update
   mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper software
   from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

   participants.
   Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail and People,
   joined the team to welcome customers to Apple Antara, while Mexican R&B
   artist Mariana "Nan" de Miguel, aka Girl Ultra, performed on the
   opening night. Apple also created a special App Store story and Apple
   Music playlist to celebrate the opening.

   which is now Apple's second retail store in Mexico City, after Apple
   Vía Santa Fe.

Hollywood Mac Pro Workstations Hit by Mysterious Software Issue [Updated]

   Tuesday September 24, 2019 2:34 AM PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Update: In a statement, AVID has indicated that the root cause for the
   reboot issue is unrelated to its creative tools. Google has since
   confirmed that a Chrome update "may have shipped with a bug that
   damages the file system on macOS machines" and has provided
   instructions for affected users.
   Original story follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Variety reports this morning of a possible computer virus attack or
   critical software failure affecting Mac Pro workstations across Los
   Angeles.
   According to social media chatter, Hollywood Film and TV editors
   discovered late on Monday that "trashcan" Mac Pros running older
   versions of macOS and AVID's Media Composer software were refusing to
   reboot after shutting down.
   The root cause of the issue remains unknown, but online speculation is
   surfacing a few possibilities, including a virus specifically targeting
   post-production Macs in the Hollywood area.
   Others have suggested an issue with AVID's iLok activation dongle, or
   perhaps a conflict with the software and a recent system update –
   possibly related to Apple's Safari browser – that is corrupting data.
   Affected users are being advised to try booting in single-user mode and
   disabling Wi-Fi so that they can back up, while non-affected AVID users
   have been told not to shut down their Macs so they can also deactivate
   Wi-Fi and any other networks until a solution is found.

     From what I gather there’s a massive failure of Macs with iLok/Avid
     that’s happening all over right now. A lot of L.A. post shops and
     people out on shows having their Macs slowly crash and wont boot
     again. Engineers are looking in to it. Don’t shut your machine off.
     #postchat
     — Matt Penn (@mattpenndotcom) September 24, 2019

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp
     — MarcusPun (@MarcusPun) September 24, 2019

   Several companies are said to have been affected by the issue. Neither
   AVID nor Apple have responded to requests for comment. This is a
   developing story that will be updated as soon as we learn more.

Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 92 With Bug Fixes and Performance
Improvements

   Wednesday September 18, 2019 10:39 AM PDT by Juli Clover
   safaripreviewicon safaripreviewicon Apple today released a new update
   for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first
   introduced three years ago in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari
   Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future
   release versions of Safari.
   Safari Technology Preview release 92 includes bug fixes and performance
   improvements for JavaScript, WebGPU, SVG, Images, Web API, Service
   Workers, WebRTC, IndexedDB, Web Inspector, Accessibility, and Security.
   The new Safari Technology Preview update is available for both macOS
   Mojave and MacOS Catalina, the newest version of the Mac operating
   system that was introduced at the June Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software
   Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the
   browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari
   Technology Preview website.
   Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from
   developers and users on its browser development process. Safari
   Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari
   browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a
   developer account to download.

Apple Says EU-Ireland Tax Order 'Defies Reality and Common Sense'

   Tuesday September 17, 2019 3:49 AM PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Apple on Tuesday argued that the European Union's order for it to pay
   13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in back taxes to Ireland "defies
   reality and common sense," as it kicked off its legal challenge against
   the ruling.
   According to Reuters, Apple also said the European Commission was using
   its powers "to retrofit changes to national law," which would create
   legal uncertainty for businesses.
   Apple sent a six-person delegation led by its CFO Luca Maestri to the
   two-day court hearing taking place over Tuesday and Wednesday in
   Luxembourg. The company is arguing the same case that CEO Tim Cook made
   in a public letter about the tax ruling three years ago; namely, that
   Apple follows the law and pays all the taxes it owes in every country
   where it operates, including Ireland.
   Apple also argues that nearly all of its research and development takes
   place in the United States, which is where the company pays the
   majority of its taxes.

     "The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple's profits
     from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two
     branches in Ireland," Apple's lawyer Daniel Beard told the court.
     He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple
     products and services and key intellectual property rights were
     developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws
     in the Commission's case.
     "The branches' activities did not involve creating, developing or
     managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary
     line defies reality and common sense," Beard said.
     "The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be
     responsible for generating almost all of Apple's profits outside the
     Americas."

   In 2016, the European Commission found Apple received illegal state aid
   from Ireland. Apple and Ireland both appealed the ruling, but the
   European Commission opened litigation against Ireland in October 2017

       iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.
     * [iphone-11-vs-xr-200x200.jpg]
       iPhone 11 vs iPhone XR
       At first glance, the two devices have quite a few similarities, but
       the iPhone 11 takes a step forward in regards to cameras, battery
       life, and more.

Deals Spotlight: Costco Discounts Apple's HomePod to $199.97 ($100 Off)

   Thursday October 3, 2019 9:13 am PDT by Mitchel Broussard
   Costco is offering Apple's HomePod for $199.97 today, which is about
   $100 off the regular price of $299.00. The retailer is only selling the
   Space Gray version of the HomePod, but those who place an order can
   expect the speaker to arrive within three to five business days (with
   an added $4.99 for shipping and handling).
   At $199.97, this is one of the lowest prices we've seen on the HomePod,
   and is a good chance for anyone looking to add more of Apple's smart
   speakers to their HomeKit setup. Of course, you'll need a Costco
   account to see the deal, which starts at $60/year. If you're a member,
   head to Costco today to browse the HomePod sale before it expires.
   Apple dropped the price of the HomePod from $349.00 to $299.00 in April
   2019. This price drop followed numerous discounts from well-known
   retailers like Target, Costco, and Best Buy, most of which began
   following a big discount on the HomePod during Black Friday 2018.

Apple Bans App That Allowed Hong Kong Protestors to Track Police Movements
[Update]

   Thursday October 3, 2019 4:03 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Apple has reportedly banned an app that allows Hong Kong protestors to
   track protests and police movements in the city state, despite
   increasing international condemnation against the violence used by the
   authorities.
   According to The Register, Apple has told the makers of the HKmap Live
   app that it can't be allowed in the App Store because it helps
   protestors to evade the police.

     "Your app contains content - or facilitates, enables, and encourages
     an activity - that is not legal ... specifically, the app allowed
     users to evade law enforcement," the American tech giant told makers
     of the HKmap Live on Tuesday before pulling it.

   Opposition to the Chinese state and the Hong Kong authorities has grown
   louder, driven by an escalation in violence against protestors over the
   past week. On Wednesday, thousands of people took to the streets of
   Hong Kong to denounce the shooting of an unarmed teenage student by
   police.
   Tsang Chi-kin was shot in the chest at point-blank range on Tuesday. He
   remains in hospital in stable but critical condition after surgery to
   remove the bullet, which narrowly missed his heart.
   The rise in police violence has led protesters to make use of digital
   networking and collaborative tools to organize street gatherings, with
   services like HKmap Live being used to help them avoid what they
   perceive as government-orchestrated attacks.
   This isn't the first time Apple has acted to remove apps from the App
   Store to abide by Chinese law. In July 2017, Apple removed the majority
   of VPN apps from the App Store in China, following regulations passed
   earlier in the year that require such apps to be authorized by the
   Chinese government.
   Update: Apple is reviewing its decision to reject HKmap Live, reports
   Bloomberg, and is likely investigating whether the software violates
   local laws. It's not yet clear if the app will be re-added to the App
   Store and the developer has not yet received an update from Apple
   following the commencement of the new review.

   topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion,
   Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to

Analyst Survey Suggests Most Netflix Users Don't Plan to Subscribe to Apple
TV+

   Thursday October 3, 2019 3:33 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Three-quarters of Netflix subscribers have no intention of subscribing
   to either Apple TV+ or Disney+ when they launch next month, according
   to surveys conducted by Piper Jaffray (via CNBC).
   According to the investment banker's survey of 1,500 Netflix
   subscribers, roughly 75 percent don't intend to subscribe to the
   upcoming rival streaming services, although those who do subscribe to
   Apple TV+ or Disney+ also expect to keep their Netflix subscription
   going.

     "Our survey suggests that the majority (~75%) of Netflix subscribers
     do not intend to subscribe to either Disney+ or Apple TV+. For those
     that do expect to use one of these offerings, the vast majority
     expect to also maintain their Netflix subscription," Piper Jaffray
     analyst Michael Olson said.
     "Most existing Netflix subscribers appear to be trending towards
     multiple streaming video subscriptions, especially as many continue
     to reduce their spend on traditional TV offerings," Olson said.

   The survey should provide some comfort for Netflix investors following
   news of slowing subscriber growth over the last three months, along
   with fears about the effect that the new streaming competition will
   have on the company's stock price.
   As CNBC's Michael Bloom notes, optimistic forecasts for Netflix were
   nearly universal on Wall Street as recently as July, but Netflix stock
   has since dropped nearly 30 percent and effectively wiped out its 2019
   gains.
   Amid the challenges, Netflix has been looking at new marketing
   strategies to help fend off its upcoming rivals. For example, the
   streaming leader has been offering non-subscribers access to the first
   episode of its new series, Bard of Blood, for a limited time.
   Apple TV+ launches on November 1, with Disney+ arriving a little over a
   week after, on November 12. Apple is offering a one-year free trial of
   Apple TV+ to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, or iPod
   touch.

Mario Kart Tour is Nintendo's Biggest Mobile Launch to Date With 90 Million
Downloads in First Week

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:23 am PDT by Tim Hardwick
   Nintendo's latest smartphone app Mario Kart Tour has been downloaded
   over 90 million times since it launched last week, according to new
   download estimates shared by Sensor Tower.
   The number eclipses both Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp and Super Mario
   Run, which were downloaded a respective 14.3 million times and just
   under 13 million times in their debut week, making Mario Kart Tour
   Nintendo's biggest mobile game launch to date.
   Breaking down the figure across platforms, the free-to-play game was
   downloaded 36.5 million times on iOS devices, while the Android version
   was downloaded 53.3 million times.
   In terms of overall revenue driven by in-app purchases, Mario Kart Tour
   earned $12.7 million, so it hasn't reached the heights of Fire Emblem
   Heroes, which earned Nintendo $28.2 million in its first week. Super
   Mario Run meanwhile clocked up $16.1 million in its debut week, making
   Mario Kart Tour the company's third-biggest game.
   Across platforms, $9.6 million (75.5 percent) was spent in-game by iOS
   device users, while Android IAPs amounted to $3.1 million (24.5
   percent). Most spending occurred in the U.S. with $5.8 million,
   followed by Japan ($4 million) and France ($752,000).
   Announced in January 2018, Mario Kart Tour was delayed several times
   before its debut last week. The game features an optional "Gold Pass"
   subscription, which introduces various in-game items and badges and
   also unlocks the faster 200cc mode. Nintendo is offering a two-week
   free trial, after which it costs $4.99 a month.
   Mario Kart Tour is a free download from the App Store, requires iOS 10
   or later to play, and officially supports iPhone 5s or iPad Air and
   later devices. A Nintendo Account is also required to play the game.

Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 13.2 Update to Developers [Update: Public Beta
Available]

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:08 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 13.2 update to
   developers for testing purposes, a little over one week after releasing
   the tvOS 13 update.
   Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV models, the new
   tvOS 13.2 developer beta can be downloaded onto the Apple TV via a
   profile that's installed using Xcode.
   tvOS updates (aside from major releases) have historically been minor
   in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather
   than major outward-facing changes. Apple provides little to no
   information on what's included in tvOS updates, so we may not discover
   anything new after installing the new beta.
   Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS updates, we let MacRumors
   readers know when new software is available so developers are able to
   download it upon release.
   If we find anything new in the tvOS 13.2 beta, we'll update this
   article.
   tvOS 13, released earlier in September, introduced multi-user support,
   a new Control Center, Apple Arcade and controller support, new
   screensavers and more.

Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 6.1 to Developers

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 10:05 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming watchOS 6.1 beta to
   developers, a little over a week after seeding the first watchOS 6.1
   beta and two weeks after releasing the watchOS 6 update with full App
   Store, new Apple Watch faces, and more.
   Once the proper configuration profile has been installed from the Apple
   Developer Center, the new watchOS beta can be downloaded through the
   dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General > Software
   Update.
   To install the update, the Apple Watch needs to have over 50 percent
   battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it has to be in range of
   the iPhone.
   There were no major changes found in the first watchOS 6.1 beta, so
   it's not entirely clear what's included in the update, but we'll update
   this article should new features be found in the second beta. The
   update may be focused on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance
   improvements.
   watchOS 6.1 does work with the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch
   models, which were excluded from the watchOS 6 release.
   Apple said that watchOS 6 would come to the older Apple Watch models at
   a later date, so it's possible watchOS 6.1 will be the first version of
   watchOS 6 to work with the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watches.

Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 93 With Bug Fixes and Performance
Improvements

   Wednesday October 2, 2019 9:59 am PDT by Juli Clover
   safaripreviewicon safaripreviewicon Apple today released a new update
   for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first
   introduced three years ago in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari
   Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future
   release versions of Safari.
   Safari Technology Preview release 93 includes bug fixes and performance
   improvements for Resource Timing, SVG, Web API, Web Inspector,
   Accessibility, Apple Pay, JavaScript, WebGPU, Web Authentication, and
   WebDriver.
   The new Safari Technology Preview update is available for both macOS
   Mojave and MacOS Catalina, the newest version of the Mac operating
   system that was introduced at the June Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software
   Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the
   browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari
   Technology Preview website.
   Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from
   developers and users on its browser development process. Safari
   Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari
   browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a
   developer account to download.

'Black Panther' Star Winston Duke to Star in Apple's 'Swagger' TV Series

   Tuesday October 1, 2019 11:33 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Winston Duke, known for his role M'Baku in "Black Panther," is set to
   star in Apple's upcoming TV series "Swagger," reports Variety.
   Duke will play Ike, a youth basketball coach who used to be a star
   player. Production on the show is set to begin in October, more than a
   year after Apple first picked up the series.

                           Image via Winston Duke

   "Swagger," which is based on NBA star Kevin Durant's youth basketball
   experiences, is said to explore the world of youth basketball, the
   players, their families, and their coaches.
   "Swagger" is one of the TV shows that Apple is developing for its Apple
   TV+ streaming service, which is set to launch in November. As
   production is first starting, "Swagger" won't be available at launch
   and will instead be a show premiering at a later date.
   Apple TV+ will cost $4.99 per month for up to six family members, and
   Apple is offering a free one-year subscription to customers who
   purchase an Apple TV, Mac, iPad, or iPhone.

Halide Camera for iOS Gains Support for iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro

   Monday September 30, 2019 1:11 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Halide, a popular camera app designed for iOS devices, was today
   updated with support for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, with the
   company adding new features able to take advantage of the hardware in
   the new devices.
   There's a faster lens switcher that uses Haptic Touch to switch between
   the two focal lengths in the iPhone 11 (wide and ultra wide) and the
   three focal lengths in the iPhone 11 Pro (wide, ultra wide, and
   telephoto). Halide's developers say it's quicker, smoother and more
   intuitive than the standard lens switcher.
   On the iPhone 11 Pro, there's a new Lens Guides feature designed to
   help users compose shots. The Lens Guides appear when the lens switcher
   tool is opened, providing overlays of what a shot would look like using
   a different focal length.
   There are no manual focus controls for the ultra wide-angle camera in
   Halide, and that's because the lens has a fixed focus. The ultra
   wide-angle camera is not capable of RAW output, nor does Apple's
   outside the frame feature work with RAW. Halide hasn't added outside
   the frame functionality at this time.
   Smart RAW has been updated for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, with the exposure
   engine tuned to produce RAW shots with less noise. Smart RAW
   improvement for the new iPhones is an ongoing product though, with
   Halide planning to add additional refinements in the future.
   For older iPhones, the new version of Halide includes bug fixes and
   enhancements, along with RAW exposure improvements for all Smart RAW
   iPhones.
   Halide can be downloaded from the App Store for $5.99. [Direct Link]

Apple Reportedly Increasing iPhone 11 Lineup Production by Up to 10% Due to
Strong Demand

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:14 pm PDT by Eric Slivka
   Apple has asked suppliers to increase production of its new iPhone 11
   and iPhone 11 Pro lineup by up to 10 percent, according to Nikkei Asian
   Review. The bump in production would add up to 8 million units to the
   current production plans as Apple seeks to meet stronger-than-expected
   demand.

     "This autumn is so far much busier than we expected," one source
     with direct knowledge of the situation said. "Previously, Apple was
     quite conservative about placing orders," which were less than for
     last year's new iPhone. "After the increase, prepared production
     volume for the iPhone 11 series will be higher compared to last
     year," the source said.

   The report claims the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are seeing the
   strongest demand, while Apple is actually revising orders for the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max down slightly as it seeks to balance production with
   demand.
   Nearly every year, stories circulate about Apple cutting production in
   the months following the launches of new iPhones, but it's frequently
   unclear whether production cuts are due to weaker-than-expected demand
   or simply anticipated scaling back following the initial rush of
   orders. Regardless, an increase in production this year appears to be a
   good sign for Apple.
   With the launch of three new iPhone models with improved cameras,
   Apple's iPhone lineup may be appealing to a broad array of customers
   ready to upgrade from older models, particularly with the iPhone 11
   starting at $699, which is $50 less than its iPhone XR predecessor.
   Those looking for an even more budget-friendly new iPhone may have some
   welcome news early next year, with multiple reliable sources indicating
   that Apple is planning to launch a new "iPhone SE 2" that would
   actually look very similar to the iPhone 8 but with upgraded internals
   such as Apple's latest A13 chip and 3 GB of RAM.

   Wrong !
   The 15% iPhone Tariff hits on Dec 15th, & Apple needs to get as many
   2019 iPhones as possible into the Sales Channel BEFORE then !!!
   The units need to clear customs & NOT be in a Warehouse !
   Two are the two main criteria, else they will get hit with the 15%
   tariff (starting on Dec 15th).
   NOT a single so-called Pro Stock Analyst who covers AAPL for a living
   has yet picked up on this, NOR even a single Regular on CNBC !

   was actually interested in the 11 pro max but the price in singapore is
   2k for a 256gb model and 1.7k for a 64gb.
   sorry but unless this phone can make me breakfast and wipe my ass, it
   is not worth 2k. not just the iphone, no phone is worth 2k.
   for comparison, 2k can get me an asus zenbook with change for a 2019
   ipad.
   or a surface pro 6/7 with change for a 2019 ipad.
   or a new pc with a 2070ti on AMD zen 2 with 16gb ram, 1tb ssd and a
   144hz gaming monitor.
   or 4 boxes of cuban cigars.
   or 17 bottles of whisky.
   or 13 bottles of quality cognac.
   or stock up my entire bar.
   or get drunk and die of liver failure in 1 night.
   these would all be more viable choices than spending it all on a phone.

   The tariffs haven't come out of the blue. It's been known for a long
   time. They wouldn't have waited until now, several weeks after launch,
   to up production, if what you are suggesting was true.
   Edit: I too am seeing a lot of people lined up at the stores here to
   get one. Frankly, I'm quite surprised. All I was hearing was what a dud
   this year would be. Guess thats what I get when I come on MacRumors and
   read all the negativity and believe some of it.

   I think everyone assumes all people upgrading are on the most recent
   phones or something. If you have an xs max and aren’t super impressed
   by the 11, all I got to say is: well duh!! But for those with a 7 or
   older, this is one hell of an upgrade
   Most of the iPhone 6,6s,7 buyer isn't looking forward to replacing its
   device with a notch screen.

   So, what are you saying is "wrong" here? It's not clear.
   Greater than expected demand - is that what you think is wrong?
   I think you may have pointed out something about tariffs - possibly,
   but it seems like you are saying that there is no "greater than
   expected demand" - and I was wondering how you know that, or even if
   that's what your assuming and implying.
   Someone can just as easily say that you are wrong.
   PS - I agree CNBC and all the lame analysts talk jive. Is it the same
   jive as you though? Bias causes a lot of people to push fake ideas on
   others.

   Underwhelming for who and who? Perhaps for those who own last year’s
   device (even that you cannot be sure), but there are many more
   upgrading quite older handsets. Again, who are the “most of the buyers”
   who plan or returning theirs? You must be some kind of wizard.

   Hello there
   Anyone knows how long does it take to manufacture an iPhone and to hit
   the shelves? Is it 2 weeks or one month?
   We have a lot of unavalbility here. I am still waiting a few more weeks
   before buying a 11 Pro: I can see a lot of issues with iOS 13.x so
   maybe iOS 13.2 or 13.3 will fix everything.
   There has been so many issues with the software and such lately I would
   wait a bit before upgrading. My reminders don’t even work right now
   after 3 bug fix updates. This is crazy.
   you can never feel bad waiting it out. I’d wait until next month at
   least

Apple Shares Another Teaser for M. Night Shyamalan Apple TV+ Series 'Servant'

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today shared a new teaser trailer for its upcoming TV show
   "Servant," which is a psychological thriller created by Tony Basgallop
   and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan.
   The series is said to follow a Philadelphia couple (played by Tony
   Kebbell and Lauren Ambrose) who hire a young nanny named Leanne (Nell
   Tiger Free) to care for their newborn child, who, based on the
   trailers, appears to be a fake baby.

   The new teaser trailer is one of three that Apple has shown so far,
   with the others previewed during the Emmy Awards in September.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/__-M5gA3pIU

   Servant will not be available when Apple TV+ launches on November 1,
   but it will be coming out soon after on November 28. Apple TV+ will be
   priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple is offering a free subscription to
   customers who purchase an Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
   At launch, Apple TV+ will offer several TV shows, including
   "Dickinson," "For All Mankind," "Helpsters," "Ghostwriter," and "The
   Morning Show."

   M Night didnt write this, he just produced it according to the full
   article.
   I didn’t realize that. Thought he was the writer as well.
   I’d guess he slipped Philadelphia into it though. :)

   Like his movies or not, I appreciate that he sets most of his stories
   in Philadelphia (where he’s from). Much like Stephen King and Maine.

       iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.

Tim Cook Talks Cryptocurrency, Quality Journalism, Privacy and More on
European Tour

   Thursday October 3, 2019 5:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently in Europe, and over the course of the
   last few days, he's visited Germany, France, and Italy. Earlier this
   week we shared an interview he did with a German news site, and today
   he spoke with a French newspaper and students in Italy as part of an
   appearance at the Osservatorio Permanente.
   Cook commented on topics like journalism, privacy, and immigration,
   with his comments shared by Italian site Macitynet.it [Google
   Translate] and French newspaper Les Echoes (via CNBC).

                     Image shared by Tim Cook on Twitter

   According to Cook, while the internet has brought "many positive
   things," fake news is one negative. From a translation of the original
   interview:

     All of us lovers of democracy and freedom must think that separating
     the false from the true is the basis of freedom. Quality journalism
     is the foundation of every democracy and an open and free press is
     essential.

   Cook also spoke about a topic that he's covered many times in the past
   - privacy. He reiterated his belief that Apple customers are not
   Apple's product, and that Apple will not sell customer data. "At Apple,
   we will never treat you as products but as customers with dignity and
   respect," he said.
   Along with touching on privacy, Cook highlighted Apple's environmental
   efforts, such as the fact that Apple is run on 100 percent renewable
   energy, and he spoke on human rights. "We do not do it because it's
   required by regulations, but because it is a moral imperative," he
   said.
   Apple supports immigration because wealthy countries must "accept
   migrants who are fleeing difficult situations," said Cook. Cook added
   that he would like for young people and children to be able to stay in
   the United States to study, referencing his support for DACA, or the
   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy.
   Cook had advice for students regarding smartphone usage. "Smartphones
   must bring you closer to those who are far away - don't leave those
   close to you," he said. "If you spend more time looking at your
   smartphones than people's eyes, you're wrong."
   Cook also spoke about cryptocurrency according to CNBC, with statements
   originally shared by French site Les Echoes. Cook said that currency
   should stay in the hands of countries, and private companies should not
   look to gain power with cryptocurrency.

     "No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of
     countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group
     setting up a competing currency," he said.
     "A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way."

   Apple's vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey recently said that
   Apple is "watching" cryptocurrency in regards to potentially supporting
   it in the future, but said that the company is primarily focused on
   what consumers are using today.
   Cook's comments come three months after Facebook announced plans to
   launch a new digital currency called Libra next year in partnership
   with companies like Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, and Stripe.
   Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this
   topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion,
   Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to
   read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members
   with at least 100 posts.

   Remember when Steve Jobs did rare interviews and he’d talk about Apple,
   the Mac, the iPod and iPhone? I loved that. But more importantly, he
   loved that. And he was right about Apple and he knew what he was
   talking about. I like Cook, but his opinion on those topics is
   genuinely worth no more than yours or mines. Only difference is if he
   cares about immigration he can save money in Apples operations...

   Typical. Timmy goes to Europe or sendout screeds here at home lecturing
   on privacy but happily gets on his knees & shuts up when he goes to
   Beijing...
   "Quality journalism" - translation: If it promotes a far-left liberal
   agenda and suppresses conservative speech then it's quality journalism
   Timmy needs to be removed asap

   I recall Steve Jobs sitting on a humble wooden stool, wearing the same
   outfit he had worn for a decade, drilling the concept of his products
   into the minds of those willing to listen on the various media outlets.
   His passion and love for revolution and his obsession for chasing that
   perfect solution to real product problems was what got Apple moving in
   the right direction after years of management creating a sleeping
   beast.
   Tim likes his steel, glass and stone fortresses ... his expensive
   wooden boxes in his Apple Groves ... and his big political ideas. He
   likes his incredible pipeline that we've heard about for the greater
   portion of a decade. He likes his profits on evolutionary products, his
   large salary and his huge bonus. Tim, why not let the ship sail with
   fresh leadership equally obsessed with product innovation as Jobs, and
   take on the role of a full time politician?
   Yours Truly,
   Everybody.

   I was literally coming here to say this. The “Federal” Reserve is not
   government. The name is a nice disguise, though.

   I believe people with power and influence (being CEO of one of the
   largest companies in the world gives you a lot of influence) should
   always try and make something good for the world.
   Steve Jobs was a great CEO, and a visionary product wise. But I would
   have loved to see Steve Jobs showing more care for other kind of
   things, like Bill Gates. What he is trying to do with his foundation,
   is amazing.
   EDIT:
   As CEOs, both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were amazing. As innovators and
   marketeers, Jobs definitely had the advantage. But as a human being, I
   do believe Bill Gates is one of the best. And Tim Cook, in his own way,
   is trying to do something more than just being a CEO.

   Astonished that some people still don't understand how interviews work;
   ie the interviewer asks questions, prompting the interviewee to respond
   with answers to the questions asked.

Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:59 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple may have recently acquired UK-based motion capture company
   IKinema, based on evidence from company filings and information shared
   by a MacRumors reader.
   IKinema offers animation technology that's used for games, virtual
   reality, and more. Earlier this year, for example, IKinema partnered
   with Ubisoft for IKinema's RunTime software for character creation.
   IKinema specialized in technology that allowed for real-time motion
   animation of virtual characters.

     IKINEMA's technology is embraced by development teams the world over
     to bring their games to life through delivery of high fidelity
     results in natural character locomotion and greater player immersion
     within dynamic game worlds, including substantial cost reduction and
     accelerated production levels by a factor of five times or more to
     expedite the release of games to market.

   Based on details from IKinema's mostly defunct website, the company
   considers itself a specialist in real-time procedural animation and
   whole body solving technology. IKinema has several videos on YouTube
   showing off its technology creating animated characters from real-life
   people, dogs, and more.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/849vDheMyXs

   According to a document filed with the UK government, Apple lawyer
   Peter Denwood, who handles Apple's international affairs, was named the
   director of IKinema on September 12, 2019, with his address listed as
   One Apple Park Way.
   The address of the company was also updated to 100 New Bridge Street in
   London on September 26, which is the address for Apple Europe Limited.
   The IKinema website is no longer functional with the exception of a few
   technical documents, and the company's Twitter and Facebook accounts
   stopped being updated on August 19. MacRumors reader Peter, who is in
   the industry, told MacRumors that IKinema customers have been left in
   the dark "for weeks" and that the acquisition was confirmed in a
   private Facebook Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.

   One of these days, Apple will acquire IKEA, and rename it iKea. The
   prices of everything they sell will skyrocket, but on the plus size,
   the furniture and housewares will get thinner and thinner.
   The Apple iTorp 3S+ sofa group will have a triple-lens camera system,
   and be only a foot wide. Will make it tough to sit on, and as it will
   be made mostly of glass, it will be fairly fragile, but GOD will it
   take fantastic selfies, even in low light! AND it will be able to
   connect wirelessly to the internet!
   Only $4,278.95 with 6GB of CLSDDR4 RAM... (Chaise Lounge Sofa Double
   Data Rate 4th generation Random Access Memory,) and 32GB storage for
   the base model. Of course, what Apple won’t tell you is that
   furnitureOS takes 28GB of storage to work. Never mind why a SOFA needs
   RAM...
   I could be wrong, but it would be really funny. The alternative is that
   IKEA gets a BUNCH of money from somewhere and buys Apple. The next
   year, they announce the new iPhøn, which you have to assemble yourself
   from 178 individual parts, and the instructions are of course, almost
   free of words, just pictographs showing someone with REALLY tiny hands
   putting things together, and the obligatory sketch of someone with
   GIANT hands, (by which I mean regular-sized hands,) on a frustrated
   person, unable to even pick up or hold the tiny bits, smiling while
   calling customer service for help, and customer service sending a tiny
   little pixie of a person in a blue-striped, yellow colored IKEA
   uniform, over to assist the customer.
   For a fee, of course.
   That was a lot of effort for very little reward.

   I just bought ones, they’re pretty good, Im a freelancer developer,
   they’re great for taking calls and for switching between iPhone/Mac, I
   can be making lunch or dinner, skip songs, call someone throw siri,
   without using my hands and with the phone charging upstairs. It’s not
   perfect and not exactly cheap but they’re great nonetheless.

   Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.
   Article Link: Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema
   ('https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/03/apple-acquisition-ikinema/')
   One of these days, Apple will acquire IKEA, and rename it iKea. The
   prices of everything they sell will skyrocket, but on the plus size,
   the furniture and housewares will get thinner and thinner.
   The Apple iTorp 3S+ sofa group will have a triple-lens camera system,
   and be only a foot wide. Will make it tough to sit on, and as it will
   be made mostly of glass, it will be fairly fragile, but GOD will it
   take fantastic selfies, even in low light! AND it will be able to
   connect wirelessly to the internet!
   Only $4,278.95 with 6GB of CLSDDR4 RAM... (Chaise Lounge Sofa Double
   Data Rate 4th generation Random Access Memory,) and 32GB storage for
   the base model. Of course, what Apple won’t tell you is that
   furnitureOS takes 28GB of storage to work. Never mind why a SOFA needs
   RAM...
   I could be wrong, but it would be really funny. The alternative is that
   IKEA gets a BUNCH of money from somewhere and buys Apple. The next
   year, they announce the new iPhøn, which you have to assemble yourself
   from 178 individual parts, and the instructions are of course, almost
   free of words, just pictographs showing someone with REALLY tiny hands
   putting things together, and the obligatory sketch of someone with
   GIANT hands, (by which I mean regular-sized hands,) on a frustrated
   person, unable to even pick up or hold the tiny bits, smiling while
   calling customer service for help, and customer service sending a tiny
   little pixie of a person in a blue-striped, yellow colored IKEA
   uniform, over to assist the customer.
   For a fee, of course.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Golden Master to Developers

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:07 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the golden master version of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, three days after seeding the tenth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The golden master version of macOS Catalina represents the final
   version of the update that will be provided to the public at release.
   The new macOS Catalina software can be downloaded using the Software
   Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper
   profile from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

   This may well be at least that bad. Apple is intentionally breaking
   software that millions of people rely on.
   Dropping 32 bit support is inexcusable. I'm anticipating my phone
   ringing off the hook in the weeks after release with people needing me
   to remove 10.15 and reinstall 10.14.
   I'm disabling automatic macOS updates on every machine I touch. Almost
   nobody in the real world is ready for this.
   And what's worse, I've got it running on a test machine, have had it
   for months now. It doesn't add anything useful. Other than broken
   software and the inexplicable System Preferences rearrange, it's almost
   indistinguishable from 10.14.
   Oh, so you're one of those people.
   You probably said the same thing when Mac OS X Lion dropped Power PC
   apps. The real world isn't ready for it. Well, if they are not ready
   now, they will be soon. Apple Has been moving to 64 bit for the last 14
   years. I am surprised its taken them this long. They probably have been
   thinking about dropping 32 bit apps since Yosemite. Just be happy those
   apps were supported for this long, and move on.
   Every year we get people like you, especially when there is a big
   change. People who stood by Mac OS X Tiger, and said that Leopard would
   never replace it.
   Same with Snow Leopard, and Mavericks. But the world has moved on
   People will move on from Mojave and 32 bit apps eventually.
   Just you wait when Apple moves away from Intel CPUs. You will be all up
   in arms.
   FYI, there are plenty of changes, including the split up of iTunes
   without removing any features, the ability to use an iPad as a display,
   and several others.
   Just because the interface is extremely similar to Mojave does not mean
   that it is the same.

   […]
   Come on - Apple started the transition to 64 Bit in 2005 with Mac OS X
   10.4 Tiger. That was 14 years ago - I'd say any developer who had only
   the slightest intention to keep his code up to date had plenty of time
   to do so …

   People like this confuse me. There's a platform that offers 34 years of
   ABI compatibility: Windows. It's a more popular platform and cheaper
   too. A platform that guarantees you can stay on the same OS version for
   10 years while remaining secure and supported.
   I don't know why people go out of their way to choose a platform that
   has removed technical cruft, at the expense of breaking legacy
   software, for literally it's entire existence. A platform that has
   major API deprecations and removals yearly. Then go complain about it.

   I don't think any OS can compare to that disaster :rolleyes:
   It really wasn't a bad OS. 3rd party drivers and Intel pushing a
   recycled chipset that maxed out at (IIRC) 1gb of RAM were the biggest
   issues. nVidia specifically was responsible for over 50% of crashes at
   one point, and OEMs selling laptops with the minimum amount of RAM were
   another headache.
   On a proper laptop (like a MBP, ironically) and without bloatware,
   Vista was a rather good OS at launch. File IO was a tad slow, but it
   was otherwise reliable.
   Case in point: Windows 7 was mostly just a service pack and UI facelift
   for Vista.
   Edit: I've been corrected. The chipset issue was that it didn't "the
   Intel 915 GPU doesn't support WVDDM, which was required for Vista
   certification." Thanks [USER=995807]WaruiKoohii[/USER]. That's how you
   ended up with Vista ready vs Vista compatible issue too.

   Maybe to you, but the XCode tools for SwiftUI and Catalyst apps are the
   biggest change in macOS for years pertinent to enterprise development.

Kuo: Apple to Launch 'iPhone SE 2' in Early 2020 With Similar Design as
iPhone 8, A13 Chip, and 3GB RAM

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:27 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple plans to release a lower-priced "iPhone SE 2" in the first
   quarter of 2020, according to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
   In a research note with TF International Securities, obtained by
   MacRumors, Kuo said the device will feature a similar form factor
   design and specifications as the iPhone 8, with a faster A13 chip and
   3GB of RAM:

     We forecast that Apple will launch the more affordable iPhone SE2 in
     1Q20. For the most part, the form factor design and hardware spec
     are similar to iPhone 8's. The most significant hardware spec
     upgrade will be the adoption of the A13 processor and 3GB LPDDR4X.
     iPhone SE2 will likely increase iPhone's market share and benefit
     Apple's promotions for service and content. We expect that the
     iPhone SE2 shipment will reach 30–40mn units in 2020.

   Kuo believes the "iPhone SE 2" will be the "best upgrade choice" for an
   estimated 100 million remaining iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users,
   serving as a "key growth driver" for Apple in 2020. He believes these
   customers have low desire for new features like Face ID and multiple
   cameras, suggesting the "iPhone SE 2" will stick with Touch ID and a
   single-lens rear camera.
   Kuo's prediction lines up with multiple other sources that have claimed
   Apple plans to release a new lower-cost iPhone 8-esque device next
   year, including the Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, Japanese
   publication Nikkei Asian Review, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby
   Wu.
   Those earlier reports indicated the device will sport a 4.7-inch
   display and a Touch ID home button like the iPhone 8. Apple continues
   to sell the iPhone 8 from $449, while the iPhone SE was $349 prior to
   being discontinued. When new, the iPhone 8 and iPhone SE started at
   $699 and $399 respectively.

   they should have gone with the smaller enclosure like the iphone SE and
   then edge to edge which would give large display in small enclosure.
   If the SE people wanted a iPhone 8 sized SE, they would likely have
   bought an iphone 7/8.

   It has always seemed a bit weird to me that Apple seems to assume
   buyers of small phones are looking for something other than a premium
   experience. Why not make something in a format similar to the existing
   SE, but with an edge-to-edge screen?

   Now you people can finally shut up.

   SE fans should rejoice.
   I feel like comments like these miss what people, at least those I
   speak to, like about the SE...the fact that it’s small, not that it’s
   cheap! An SE based on an iPhone 8 is just a cheap big iPhone. If I
   wanted that I’d buy the iPhone 8 that’s already on the market.

   It's astounding that:
   [LIST=1]
   * Apple still doesn't get why people loved SE.
   * People here still don't get it as well.
   Apple thinks that SE is a phone for those on the budget. A lot of
   people here probably agree.. What SE fans wanted was a SMALL, premium
   phone. iPhone 8 form factor is NOT small. That's why we complain. Just
   go to previous articles and try to find one SE fan saying: man, I wish
   they did SE in 8 form factor. Nobody EVER said that.

   Don't desecrate the good name of the SE with a iPhone 8 based phone!!
   :'(
   That being said... I'd probably eventually get one to replace my SE.
   Wouldn't be as good or ideal but better than other options.

   So it would be better than iPhone 8, but with a similar design. What's
   the point in having both? If they just want to sell a "cheap" iPhone
   they can cut the price of 8 and call it a day.
   It would be great to have a true SE 2, either with the old chassis or
   with a new notch design with a smaller display.

   Yes, we will still complain. We want a small phone with new upgrades.
   The 8 form factor is still too big for many of us who prefer the 5S/SE.
   So you can keep your ****** comments to yourself.
