Fitch Ratings Launches ESG Heat Map for Public Finance/Infrastructure

   Fitch Ratings has launched an ESG 'heat map' for Public
   Finance/Infrastructure to provide further insight into the relevance of
   ESG factors to credit ratings. The map is designed to help users
   understand how relevant individual ESG topics are to credit ratings for
   different sub-sectors across Global Public Finance, Infrastructure and
   Project Finance issuers.

World GDP Growth to Hit an Eight-Year Low in 2020

   The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly due
   to the escalation in the US-China trade war, Fitch Ratings says in its
   new Global Economic Outlook (GEO). We now forecast world growth next
   year to fall to the lowest rate since 2012.

Profits Are Key in Turkish Banks' Capital Stress Test

   Turkey's privately-owned domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs)
   are generally better positioned than three state-owned peers against a
   potential marked deterioration in asset quality, according to Fitch
   Ratings' latest stress test report. Pre-impairment operating profit
   (PIP) is the key differentiator, and loss-absorption capacity varies
   materially across the eight D-SIBs.

Germany's Outsized Export Dependence a Growth Risk

   Germany's heavy dependence on exports means that the slump in world
   trade and manufacturing has taken a much heavier toll on growth than in
   other G7 economies. The contribution of gross export demand to German
   GDP growth has fallen very sharply over the last two years - as
   highlighted in Fitch's economics team's latest Chart of the Month - and
   has left the economy on the brink of recession.
   2019 Global Sovereign Conference Hong Kong

The Rating Watch Negative on the United Kingdom

   Fitch Ratings recently completed its Global Sovereign Conference series
   covering 8 markets around the world. At our event in Hong Kong, Michele
   Napolitano discusses the two areas that will exert pressure on the UK’s
   current rating.

Asia-Pacific Banks Face Rising Exposure to Property Risks

   Banks in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly exposed to
   property-related risks. Australia and New Zealand as most exposed to
   property stress, while Sri Lanka, Mongolia and Vietnam face elevated
   risk.

Argentina Crisis Adds to Neighboring Economies' Headwinds

   Reduced trade and financial exposures should help to limit broad-based
   regional effects from a prolonged Argentinian recession, but smaller
   economies with higher direct exposures to Argentina are likely to be
   affected more.

Advanced Economies at Late Stage in Business Cycle

   Fitch has introduced new measures of the output gap - or the degree of
   economic "slack" - for the 10 advanced economies (DM10) covered in its
   Global Economic Outlook (GEO). These measures have been built upon the
   signals sent both by the financial cycle, specifically the role of
   credit and asset prices, and direct survey-based measures of slack in
   the labour and product markets.

2019 Late Cycle Roundtable: Key Risks for U.S. States in a Potential Downturn

   How will potential federal fiscal deterioration affect U.S. states? In
   this latest installment of the Late Cycle Roundtable series, Katie
   Falconi, Americas Regional Credit Officer, leads a discussion on how
   rising budget deficits and public spending could affect U.S. public
   finance issuers.

GCC Broader Public Sector Debt Poses Fiscal Risks

   Government-related entity (GRE) debt is a significant and growing
   contingent liability for some governments of the Gulf Cooperation
   Council (GCC). The high public sector debt reflects heavy state
   involvement in the economy and the use of GREs as a key tool of
   economic policy.

Why Did Fitch Downgrade Hong Kong for First Time Since 1995?

   Andrew Fennell, director and lead analyst for Hong Kong and China at
   Fitch Ratings, explains why the agency has downgraded the city as an
   issuer of long-term, foreign currency debt for the first time since
   1995.

China's Food Security is Ensured, but a Long-Term Challenge

   China has been largely self-sufficient in major agricultural products,
   underpinned by strong domestic production, though ensuring long-term
   food security is not without challenges.

APAC Sovereigns Mostly Stable in the Face of Rising Growth Risk

   The balance of risks for APAC sovereign credit profiles has shifted
   towards weaker global growth and away from global financial conditions.
   Nineteen of our 20 sovereign ratings in the region are on Stable or
   Positive Outlooks, reflecting the cushion provided by strong fiscal and
   external buffers and shock-absorbers from flexible policy frameworks.

Protectionism Choking Global Growth Prospects

   Trade policy disruptions - including the recent sharp escalation in the
   US-China trade war and significant risks of a 'no-deal' Brexit - are
   darkening the global economic outlook.

Jinzhou Coupon Skip Underlines Varying Support for Chinese Banks

   Our support-driven ratings of Chinese banks reflect our view that the
   state's propensity to provide extraordinary support to different tiers
   of banks will vary under a stress scenario.

UK Political Volatility Means Risk of No-Deal Brexit Is Still Significant

   A 'no-deal' Brexit remains a significant risk due to UK political
   volatility, despite manoeuvres in parliament to try to prevent it. The
   nature and timing of the UK's exit from the European Union remain
   uncertain, and the risk that a no-deal departure causes substantial
   disruption to UK economic prospects is reflected in the Rating Watch
   Negative (RWN) on the UK's 'AA' sovereign rating.

EMEA Oil Majors' New Projects to Support Earnings

   More profitable assets brought on stream, higher production volumes,
   new lease accounting, and positive differences between gas spot and
   sale prices contributed to robust results for four European Fitch-rated
   major oil companies (BP, Eni, Shell and Total) despite a significant
   drop in spot oil and gas prices compared to the previous year.

Japan Consumption Tax Rise Helps Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation

   Japan's consumption tax hike supports medium-term fiscal consolidation
   efforts, and the country's sovereign credit profile, Fitch Ratings
   says. We estimate it will lower Japan's debt ratio by about 8pp of GDP
   by 2028; however, very high public debt will remain a key credit
   weakness.

Indian NBFCs Show Mixed Resilience to Testing Conditions

   The more vulnerable NBFCs are likely to be wholesale and housing
   finance companies, which on average tend to operate with higher
   leverage and weaker asset-and-liability (ALM) maturity profiles, and
   face higher concentration risks. Tight liquidity and problems in parts
   of the property-development market are likely to keep these NBFC
   sub-sectors under pressure, at least in the near term.
   2019 GLOBAL SOVEREIGN CONFERENCE HONG KONG

Why did we downgrade Hong Kong?

   Andrew Fennell discusses the key drivers behind our decision to
   downgrade Hong Kong to “AA” from “AA+”, with a “Negative” outlook at
   our Global Sovereign Conference in Hong Kong.
   2019 GLOBAL SOVEREIGN CONFERENCE HONG KONG

Overview on the Asia-Pacific Sovereign Ratings

   Speaking from our recent Global Sovereign Conference, Stephen Schwartz
   provides an overview on APAC sovereign ratings, which are mostly stable
   except positive for Vietnam and Thailand, and negative for Hong Kong.

Weak Prices Hurt Asian Palm-Oil Producers' Earnings and Leverage

   The nine palm-oil companies tracked by Fitch reported an average 26%
   rise in net debt/EBITDA in 2Q19, which resulted in a 92% yoy increase.
   We expect leverage at palm-oil producers to stay elevated throughout
   2019, as prices are unlikely to recover significantly due to muted
   palm-oil demand and higher inventory from stronger 2H19 production.

Thailand's Economy, Banks Resilient to Rising Global Risks

   Fitch Ratings (Thailand)'s annual global risk conference was attended
   by more than 300 executives and officials from the regulatory,
   investor, financial and corporate sectors. Dr Uttama Savanayana,
   Minister of Finance, was the guest of honour at the event and provided
   the keynote address.

China Corporates May Post Slowest Earnings Growth in Four Years

   China's A-share listed corporates are likely to report the slowest
   growth for revenue and profit from operations since the last downturn
   in 2015-2016 this year amid an economic slowdown and the ongoing
   US-China trade dispute.

Chinese POEs Benefit from Bank Credit Easing, Cut Bond Funding

   Chinese POEs' domestic bond maturities exceeded their new issuance by
   CNY62.7 billion in 8M19, with August 2019 the fourth straight month of
   negative net issuance. We think this was partly due to bond investors'
   continued weak sentiment for POE bonds, especially those rated below
   'AAA' domestically, and the difficulty weaker POEs have in structured
   issuance in the aftermath of the Baoshang Bank takeover in late May.

Asia-Pacific Banks Face Rising Exposure to Property Risks

   Banks in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly exposed to
   property-related risks. Australia and New Zealand as most exposed to
   property stress, while Sri Lanka, Mongolia and Vietnam face elevated
   risk.

India Tax Cuts May Bolster Growth Eventually; Fiscal Impact Comes Sooner

   The cuts, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on 20
   September, will lower the base corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% for
   companies that do not seek exemptions, and reduce the rate for some new
   manufacturing companies to 15% from 25%.

India's Big Tax Cuts Have Limited Impact on Corporates and Banks

   India's 20 billion dollar tax cut is likely to have a limited impact on
   corporates' and banks' financial profiles but may revive capex and
   demand in some sectors. The Indian government introduced an option to
   pay a reduced corporate tax of 25.2% (including all surcharges and cess
   and excluding any exemptions) from 35% and a lower effective tax rate
   of 17% for newly set-up manufacturing companies after 1 Oct 2019.

Singapore Banks' Emerging-Market Expansion Will Increase Risk

   Singapore's three major banks' expansion into more volatile emerging
   markets will weaken their risk profiles, posing challenges to asset
   quality and increasing operational complexity. Deterioration in the
   operating environment or excessive risk-taking in these markets could
   increase the likelihood of negative rating action, unless compensated
   by enhanced loss-absorption buffers.


Japanese Non-Life Insurers' Financial Strength Likely Unaffected by Typhoon
Faxai Losses

   Nikkei news reported that the gross insured loss of Japan's top four
   non-life insurers could reach several hundred billion yen, although the
   insured loss is likely to be smaller than that caused by Typhoon Jebi
   in 2018.

India's New Property Fund Does Not Address Many Challenges

   The government announced on 14th September a INR200 billion investment
   fund for stalled real-estate projects, following steps in the last few
   weeks to improve credit availability in the system, such as the partial
   credit guarantee scheme for public sector banks to purchase pooled
   assets of NBFCs/ HFCs.

Loan Repayment Buffer; Lower-Risk Lending Offsets Australian Household Debt
Rise

   Borrowers are able to prepay amounts into their mortgage loans by more
   than the scheduled payment, building up equity in the mortgage and
   reducing the principal amount outstanding. A redraw facility can be
   used to draw back excess payments, which are allowed at the lender's
   discretion.

China's Food Security is Ensured, but a Long-Term Challenge

   China has been largely self-sufficient in major agricultural products,
   underpinned by strong domestic production, though ensuring long-term

Asia-Pacific Banks Face Rising Exposure to Property Risks

   Rising household debt increases risks for banks as borrowers'
   debt-servicing capacity becomes more sensitive to economic factors, and
   a high reliance on property to collateralise loans exposes banks in a
   property market downturn.

New Zealand Regional Banks' Well Positioned for a Downturn

   Fitch's base case is for a stable operating environment, although
   downside risk from external events continues to increase. A downturn is
   likely to be felt through slower loan growth and a rise in impaired
   assets, particularly if unemployment increases significantly.

HKEX Bid for LSEG Signals Ongoing Consolidation

   The proposed transaction follows LSEG's proposed acquisition of
   Refinitiv Parent Ltd. (Refinitiv, rated 'BB'/Rating Watch Positive).
   Both proposed transactions could come with near-term integration and
   deleveraging risks; if successful, this would result in highly
   diversified platforms over the longer term, better positioned to
   compete in an increasingly consolidated industry where scale and data
   are expected to drive outperformance.

Chinese Auto ABS Has Similar Net Losses to Global Markets and Lower
Recoveries

   China's auto ABS annualised net loss (ANL) index was low over the past
   year, similar to the US and Australia, although Europe's was marginally
   better.

Why Did Fitch Downgrade Hong Kong for First Time Since 1995?

   Andrew Fennell, director and lead analyst for Hong Kong and China at
   Fitch Ratings, explains why the agency has downgraded the city as an
   issuer of long-term, foreign currency debt for the first time since
   1995.

APAC Sovereigns Mostly Stable in the Face of Rising Growth Risk

   The balance of risks for APAC sovereign credit profiles has shifted
   towards weaker global growth and away from global financial conditions.
   Nineteen of our 20 sovereign ratings in the region are on Stable or
   Positive Outlooks, reflecting the cushion provided by strong fiscal and
   external buffers and shock-absorbers from flexible policy frameworks.

Sufficient Buffers at Hong Kong Banks to Withstand Near-term Challenges

   Fitch Ratings says its recent downgrade of Hong Kong's Long-term
   Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating to 'AA'/Negative' from
   'AA+'/Stable does not have an immediate impact on its assessment of
   Hong Kong's banking system.

Jinzhou Coupon Skip Underlines Varying Support for Chinese Banks

   Our support-driven ratings of Chinese banks reflect our view that the
   state's propensity to provide extraordinary support to different tiers
   of banks will vary under a stress scenario.

China's Gas Demand Strong, Operators' Earnings to Rise in 2019

   We expect their profit margins to narrow due to a bigger share of
   earnings from lower-margin gas sales, supported by coal-to-gas
   conversion, and moderating gas-connection margins, but their business
   profiles will improve as gas sales are more stable than connections.

Korea Has Fiscal Space, but Medium Term a Challenge

   The 2020 budget announced on 29 August aims to respond to sluggish
   economic prospects stemming from the global growth slowdown, the
   US-China 'trade war', and trade tensions with Japan.

Singapore's New Digital Banks No Big Threat to Largest Banks

   The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is accepting applications for
   new digital bank licences up until the end of 2019, and it will
   announce in mid-2020 up to two digital full bank licences that allow
   access to retail deposits and up to three digital wholesale bank
   licences catering to SMEs and other non-retail segments.

China Slowdown Would Hit Banks in Asian Developed Markets Most

China's National Pipeline Co Promotes Sector Liberalisation; NOCs' Credit
Intact

   The separation of transmission and product sales will allow private
   producers and customers to access the provincial and inter-provincial
   crude-oil and natural-gas pipeline network infrastructure that is
   largely monopolised by the NOCs.

Property Quality Continues to Underpin Australian REIT Results

   Retail exposures remain challenged in the face of structural industry
   change, although larger properties in capital cities continue to fare
   better than those in regional locations, while office and industrial
   property valuations and high occupancy levels continue to benefit from
   limited supply and strong demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.

Indonesia Auto Sales to Slow Amid Rate Cuts; AUTO's Credit Profile Remains
Solid

   Bank Indonesia's interest-rate cuts, which should drive
   consumer-lending rates lower, are unlikely to lead to a strong rebound
   in auto sales and four-wheeled vehicles sales will probably continue to
   slow in 2019.

Rating Headroom Drops for APAC Telcos on High Capex

   The leverage headroom of Asia-Pacific telecom operators is narrowing,
   and is therefore likely to put near-term pressure on some of the
   ratings. We expect negative free cash flow to persist, as intensifying
   competition weakens the ability to fund rising capex and spectrum
   investments from cash generation by operations.

Revenue Diversity Key to Tencent's Resilience as China Slows

   Tencent is relatively well positioned to deal with macroeconomic
   headwinds and competitive threats in China's internet sector due to its
   solid market leadership in multiple internet segments, large economies
   of scale and greater revenue diversity.

New Rules to Limit Chinese Corporates and LGFVs' Offshore Issuance

   The Chinese regulator's recent changes in rules for offshore bond
   issuance by homebuilders and LGFVs are likely to keep Chinese corporate
   annual issuance flat in 2019, and will effectively cap it at this level
   in 2020.

Higher Loss-Absorbing Capacity Rules to Slow Australia CVB Issuance

   The Australian Prudential and Regulation Authority (APRA) in July 2019

   of risk-weighted assets by January 2024.

NBFI Funding Squeeze to Hit Indian Property Developers Hardest

   NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even

   This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such

Structural Challenges Pressure Japanese Major Banks' Profitability

   Evidence of banks increasing their risk appetite to improve
   profitability include higher exposure overseas and shifting into more
   complex structured notes from government bond holdings, although the
   extent varies among the banks.

Chinese Steel Production to Drop After Rising to Record in 1H19

   We expect steel production to decline in 2H19 due to three factors - a
   slowdown in housing construction, production restrictions led by
   environmental measures and market-driven production cuts on shrinking
   steelmaker margins.

Profitability Backs China Investment-Grade Homebuilder Ratings

   Deteriorating market sentiment may lead to a moderate fall in home
   sales in 2019, driven mainly by falling volumes, especially in
   lower-tier cities where the sales of the past few years can no longer
   be sustained.

New U.S.-China Tariffs A Further Risk To Global Growth

   U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would impose 10%
   tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of imports from China (the U.S.
   levied a 25% tariff on $200 billion out of around $540 billion of
   imports in May), beginning on September 1. The new tariffs broaden the
   goods being levied with additional tariffs and notably include consumer
   goods.

Additional Tariffs Raise Domestic Sales Risks on Indonesian Garment and
