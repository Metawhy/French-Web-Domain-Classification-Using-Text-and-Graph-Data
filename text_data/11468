     “We have been completely satisfied by the high standard of the peer
     review service provided by ESF over the last five years and we are
     fully confident to recommend ESF-Science Connect.”
     Dr Alberto Francesco Anfossi, Secretary General, Compagnia di San
     Paolo

     The quality of the process implemented by ESF and the evaluation
     reports produced (work upstream of the final selection by the
     Permanent Commission of the Regional Council) contributed to a large
     extent to the success of the implementation of this new harmonised
     mechanism at the Grand Est Region level. ESF perfectly adapted to
     the specificities of the mission during which it demonstrated
     professionalism, responsiveness, and fairness in the processing of
     projects. It is important to remember that the deadlines were
     particularly tight. The schedule was respected and thanks to the
     reactivity and the involvement of the team, the evaluations were
     given to the Region ahead of schedule. Finally, I would also like to
     emphasise the quality of the team assigned to the management of the
     project, highly professional and qualified. The Region is fully
     satisfied with the service provided by ESF and warmly thanks them
     for the work performed.

     Est Region, France

     “ESF’s multi-disciplinary expertise and robust processes have proven
     instrumental in designing and managing competitive calls and
     evaluations for our research programmes, in particular our AXA
     Post-Doctoral Fellowships. ESF has also supported an impact
     assessment of AXA’s philanthropic research programmes including a
     Career Tracking Pilot. We are looking forward to expanding our
     strategic partnership with ESF in order to increase the
     effectiveness of our funding towards academic institutions and
     researchers in Europe as well as in other Regions such as Asia,
     Africa and Latin America”.
     Raphaël Gusdorf, Head of Selection at the AXA Research Fund

     The external evaluation, provided by a group of distinguished
     experts under the auspices of the ESF in 2011, has proved an
     important step for the further development of instruments and
     procedures at the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS). The report
     acknowledged a great number of good practices at the agency,
     however, even more importantly, it served as an impetus to re-think
     and re-structure the aspects where recommendations for further
     improvement were provided. Results of the evaluation had significant
     influence on modifications of the general rules of procedure
     completed in 2016, and the recently-adopted Strategy of Operation
     and Development of the Slovenian Research Agency to 2020.
     Prof. József Györkös, Director of the Slovenian Research Agency
     (ARRS)

     Signs from the ESF’s existing activities in research support are
     positive: for example, the EU’s Graphene Flagship, with which the
     ESF has worked since 2012. “The ESF has been a very valuable
     partner,” says Jari Kinaret, director of the flagship. “By
     organising a competitive call it has brought in quite a few new
     partners.” The ESF now leads the flagship’s work package on
     alignment, to link nationally funded work with that paid for by the
     European Commission. It also handles cooperation with Korea, the US
     and Japan. “Later, we may have more international partners and the
     ESF will certainly be involved,” Kinaret says.

     The Research Council of Lithuania (RCL) was established in 1991 and
     underwent substantial re-organisation during the past 5-6 years.
     Therefore, external evaluation of the RCL carried out by the
     European Science Foundation‘s Evaluation Committee was a well-timed
     and essential step that brought benefits not only to the RCL itself
     by providing the opportunity to measure its activities according to
     the international standards, but also initiated broad discussions on
     research and innovation policy in the State among chief actors in
     this field.

     The AXA Research Fund initiated a partnership with the European
     Science Foundation two years ago. The ESF has demonstrated great
     skills in conducting the Post-Doctoral Campaign peer review process.
     ESF is now handling more than 400 applications yearly for us. Their
     extensive experience, the quality of their network of researchers
     and reviewers, as well as the professionalism of the ESF
     coordination team has proven to be key assets to support the
     philanthropic initiative of the AXA Group. It ensures fairness,
     robustness and transparency of the process and allows the AXA
     Research Fund to meet the highest standards of an academic selection
     process.
     Godefroy Beauvallet, Former Head of the AXA Research Fund

     ESF staff worked with professionalism for the evaluation of projects
     in the frame of University of Torino’s ‘2020 Researchers:
     Train2Move’ programme, providing an efficient service. Our staff was
     pleased to have had the opportunity to collaborate with a highly
     performing team that satisfied our expectations.

     The European Science Foundation (ESF) provided services of Peer
     Review support to the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT),
     the Portuguese national funding agency for research, for the latest
     review of R&D units in Portugal. FCT benefitted from ESF’s deep and
     thorough knowledge of peer review processes in setting up the
     structure of the review as a whole, as well as in implementing
     several of the steps involved in this two-stage complex review.
     ESF’s thoroughness and professionalism ensured fairness and
     transparency in all stages of the review, totally in line with the
     best international practices regarding peer review.
     Paulo Pereira, Former FCT Vice-President

     ESF administered the competitive call of the Graphene Flagship,
     which is one of the largest collaborative research programmes
     launched by the European Commission. As a response to the call, over
     700 organisations submitted 220 proposals on 13 separate topics. ESF
     ran the whole process from setting up the application system,
     identifying and recruiting global experts, organising and
     supervising the review meetings, to compiling and communicating the
     review results and responding to questions the applicant had during
     and after the process. The Graphene Flagship is very satisfied with
     how the ESF handled our competitive call, and we are impressed by
     the organisation’s professionalism in managing large international
     research calls.

     The Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) is pleased to
     acknowledge the excellent service provided by the European Science
     Foundation (ESF) in conducting its international evaluation within
     the general context of Hungarian and European public research
     funding. ESF established an evaluation protocol including
     appropriate evaluation criteria and methodology, as well as a
     detailed work plan in consultation with OTKA. The implementation of
     an independent evaluation study by a committee of experienced R&D
     executives and researchers, along with the expert assistance from
     dedicated ESF staff, led to the publication of the Organisational
     Evaluation of the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund– a report that
     will serve as a point of reference for a long time to come.
     László P. Kollár, President, Hungarian Scientific Research Fund
     (OTKA)
