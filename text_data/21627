I been through the desert on a horse with no name {Countdown to Halloween day
2}

   Something Borrowed...Something Blue...Something Creepy... Something
   New!
   We were fortunate enough to have a GREAT friend let us park their horse
   drawn hearse in our haunt for Halloween...beware, the driver will take
   bodies even if they are still kicking!

Losing my head! {Countdown to Halloween Day 1}

   So behind for Halloween already! I have ran into some bad luck of late
   that has left me a bit on the physically unfit as well as so many time
   commitments. We are running so far behind....I am about to lose my
   head!

About wicKED

   My photo

   wicKED
          Big Stone Gap, Virginia, United States
          My name is Ked and I am one of the biggest fans of all things
          Halloween, a Halloween enthusiast if you will. Looking to learn,
          share, and celebrate all wicKED things. You will find fact,
          fiction, reviews, rankings, humor, and horror in these pages. I
          hope to bring the spirit of Halloween to all, especially those
          that live locally. I have over 20 years experience in the
          commercial haunted house industry, running haunts for various
          non profits and charities. I have also worked at the advisory
          level for two nationally operating Haunted Houses as well as a
          subject matter expert for a syndicated talk show. I live with my
          wonderfully supportive wife, M, and our troop of enigmatic
          feline companions in a valley of the beautiful mountains of
          South West Virginia. I hope you find my blog as entertaining as
          I do writing it. Have a wicKED time!
