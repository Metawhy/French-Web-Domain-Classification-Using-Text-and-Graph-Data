About Me

   My photo

   Nina
          Nashville area singer, actress, model and DIYer.
          I have a love for music and the arts. I'm also a bit of a
          math/computer geek. I've always thought of myself as being
          artistic and have grown to love interior decorating. ... I like
          to draw, paint, create unique things, give life to old things
          and learn more in the world of design.
          I also enjoy spending time with my family, playing sports,
          hanging out with friends, and working on my health and fitness.
