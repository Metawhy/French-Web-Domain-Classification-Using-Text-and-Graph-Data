Video Communications Has Moved Beyond “Video Conferencing”

   A doctor visits an unwell child. A millennial opens new accounts when
   and how it’s convenient. Neither thinks they’re in a video conference,
   but both are on video. Enterprise teams collaborate with remote
   colleagues, engage with their customers, and imagine how to build Vidyo
   into their apps and devices.
