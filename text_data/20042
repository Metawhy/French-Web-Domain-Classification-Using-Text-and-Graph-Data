Bras

   Bras

   To calculate your maternity and breastfeeding lingerie size, start by
   buying yourself a measuring tape.
     * Below the bust (A): Measure directly below the bust
     * Cup size (B): it should be measured in the most voluminous place
       and preferably with a bra on.

   If the cup is 95 cm and the contour under the bust is 75 cm, your bra
   size corresponds to a 90B.

Your reviews (2)

          Jackie the 05 Dec. 2017

          Perfect for cosy lounging - trousers were a little long but
          easily shortened.

          Victoria the 08 Juin 2017

          Fabric is lovely and soft.
          The top is bizarre - there is the potential for
          uncomfortable/unwanted exposure as the breastfeeding
          accessibility is not discreet and there is little 'overlap'.
          The trouser bottoms are extremely long too - they will need
          taking up to avoid accidents.

   As most of our clothing is nursing friendly it has been especially
   designed to be worn from the first to the ninth month of pregnancy and
   beyond. Our designs have been fitted on pregnant women and created to
   combine style and comfort. If you are hesitating on what size to
   purchase and have measured yourself we recommend purchasing the larger
   size to ensure you will enjoy wearing Envie de Fraise pieces through
   the ninth month of pregnancy.

Bras

   Bras

   To calculate your maternity and breastfeeding lingerie size, start by
   buying yourself a measuring tape.
     * Below the bust (A): Measure directly below the bust
     * Cup size (B): it should be measured in the most voluminous place
       and preferably with a bra on.

   If the cup is 95 cm and the contour under the bust is 75 cm, your bra
   size corresponds to a 90B.

   As most of our clothing is nursing friendly it has been especially
   designed to be worn from the first to the ninth month of pregnancy and

   purchase and have measured yourself we recommend purchasing the larger
   size to ensure you will enjoy wearing Envie de Fraise pieces through
   the ninth month of pregnancy.

   To calculate your maternity and breastfeeding lingerie size, start by
   buying yourself a measuring tape.
     * Below the bust (A): Measure directly below the bust
     * Cup size (B): it should be measured in the most voluminous place
       and preferably with a bra on.

   If the cup is 95 cm and the contour under the bust is 75 cm, your bra
   size corresponds to a 90B.

   To calculate your maternity and breastfeeding lingerie size, start by
   buying yourself a measuring tape.
     * Below the bust (A): Measure directly below the bust
     * Cup size (B): it should be measured in the most voluminous place
       and preferably with a bra on.

   If the cup is 95 cm and the contour under the bust is 75 cm, your bra
   size corresponds to a 90B.

   As most of our clothing is nursing friendly it has been especially
   designed to be worn from the first to the ninth month of pregnancy and
   beyond. Our designs have been fitted on pregnant women and created to
   combine style and comfort. If you are hesitating on what size to
   purchase and have measured yourself we recommend purchasing the larger
   size to ensure you will enjoy wearing Envie de Fraise pieces through
   the ninth month of pregnancy.

   The classic size of jeans and pants where the length is not indicated
   corresponds to a standard length. The actual length may vary depending
   on the model.

Bras

   Bras

   To calculate your maternity and breastfeeding lingerie size, start by
   buying yourself a measuring tape.
     * Below the bust (A): Measure directly below the bust
     * Cup size (B): it should be measured in the most voluminous place
       and preferably with a bra on.

   If the cup is 95 cm and the contour under the bust is 75 cm, your bra
   size corresponds to a 90B.

   We suggest you select your pre-pregnancy size.

   As most of our clothing is nursing friendly it has been especially
   designed to be worn from the first to the ninth month of pregnancy and
   beyond. Our designs have been fitted on pregnant women and created to
   combine style and comfort. If you are hesitating on what size to
   purchase and have measured yourself we recommend purchasing the larger
   size to ensure you will enjoy wearing Envie de Fraise pieces through
   the ninth month of pregnancy.
