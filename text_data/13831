Abstract

   :
   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.

1. Introduction

   Globally, 2.7 billion people rely on on-site sanitation with
   containment technologies, such as septic tanks and pit latrines [1]. In
   urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, 65%–100% of the population
   is served by these technologies [1,2]. On-site sanitation can provide a
   sustainable and more affordable option to sewer-based sanitation,
   either as a standalone solution or in combination [3,4]. However,
   currently, there is a lack of sustainable management of faecal sludge,
   the material that accumulates in containment technologies. If faecal
   sludge is not emptied, collected, and delivered to appropriate
   treatment, there are serious impacts to public and environmental
   health. Emptying, collection and transport services are the critical
   link in city-wide faecal sludge management, from household-level users,
   to treatment for resource recovery and safe end-use or disposal [2,5].
   Providing sanitation is a public good and the responsibility of public
   authorities. Yet, private service providers also play a key role in
   faecal sludge management. Hence, cooperative public‑private
   partnerships are essential [6]. Faecal sludge is emptied manually or
   mechanically, both with distinct advantages and disadvantages [7,8].
   Manual service providers fulfil a crucial need in densely populated,
   low-income urban settlements (“slums”) with narrow roads or paths that
   are not accessible to trucks [9]. However, manual service provision is
   often informal and unhygienic. Additionally, this faecal sludge
   typically does not get transported to treatment but directly dumped in
   the surrounding environment, as appropriate solutions are lacking
   [10,11,12]. Mechanical emptying services are provided by motorised
   trucks with vacuum pumps. This is currently the most advanced
   technology for faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport, based
   on efficiency and limited human contact with faecal matter. However,
   these services are costly. For example, in Kampala, fuel costs make up
   25% to 35% of the cost for emptying and transport [12]. A method to
   optimise logistics of city-wide emptying services could greatly reduce
   these costs.
   The use of logistical tools and information communications technology
   to analyse emptying services in low- and middle-income countries is
   limited. However, previous studies in the field of solid waste
   management have used spatial data imbedded in geographic information
   systems (GIS) for evaluating, visualising, and optimising the logistics
   of waste collection systems [13,14]. In the context of faecal sludge
   management, Kennedy-Walker et al. [15] implemented a model-based
   approach to reduce transport time of faecal sludge. Using the potential
   of available technologies and tools for analysis of transport routes
   between the location of faecal sludge emptying and discharge locations
   would allow for optimisation of many aspects of faecal sludge
   management.
   The objectives of this study were to use GPS (global positioning
   system) and GIS tools to identify the scale of operation of mechanical
   faecal sludge emptying services, and to evaluate ways to optimise
   faecal sludge logistics at a city-wide scale to increase access to
   equitable sanitation services. These innovative methodologies and tools
   for the analyses of faecal sludge management were found to be effective
   for this purpose.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Context Area

   This research was conducted in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Kampala
   has a total area of 178 km^2 at an altitude of 1140 m, and a tropical
   climate with two rainy seasons. The city is divided into five municipal
   divisions (Central, Makindye, Rubaga, Kawempe, Nakawa), which are
   further divided into 99 parishes. Of the total city area, 64% is
   classified as residential with about 1.5 million inhabitants [16]. The
   population doubles during the day, as many people commute into the city
   [17]. Approximately 60% of the city residents live in informal
   low-income settlements, which cover 10.8% of the total city area
   [18,19]. Of the Kampala residents, 92.5% are served by on-site
   sanitation (projected for 2013), with pit latrines being the most
   prevalent containment technology (36.9%), followed by septic tanks
   (27.6%), ventilated improved pit latrines (26.1%), raised pit latrines
   (5.4%), public toilets (2.8%), and other (1.2%), including open
   defecation and bucket latrines [20].
   Faecal sludge in Kampala can only be legally discharged for treatment
   at two locations, the Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant or the Lubigi
   faecal sludge and wastewater treatment plant, both operated by the
   National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). Mechanical emptying
   service providers (vacuum trucks) and formal businesses operating with
   semi-mechanised emptying technologies (e.g., the Gulper—a direct lift
   pump that can be operated by a team of 2–3 people), discharge faecal
   sludge at either of these locations. Illegal dumping by these
   businesses has not been observed. However, it is known that within the
   informal sector (manual emptying), faecal sludge is dumped directly
   into the environment, along with pit latrines that are broken open at
   the bottom and directly drain into the environment [21]. Lubigi faecal
   sludge and wastewater treatment plant started operating in 2014, and
   was already at design capacity of 400 m^3 faecal sludge per day within
   the first months. The process flow includes settling/thickening tanks,
   followed by co-treatment of the supernatant with wastewater in
   stabilisation ponds, and drying beds for the solids. Bugolobi
   wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 32,000 m^3 of
   wastewater per day, and was not designed for the additional loading of
   faecal sludge [22]. However, since there are no other options
   available, discharge of faecal sludge at Bugolobi is allowed and
   constitutes around 200 m^3 per day to the influent. Hence, Bugolobi is
   not operating as designed or meeting effluent regulations due to solids
   overloading and technical difficulties. The treatment flow at Bugolobi
   consists of settling tanks with supernatant going to trickling filters,
   solids going to digesters (if operational) followed by drying beds.
   Overall, around 59% of excreta that is managed as faecal sludge is
   safely managed, for more detailed information, please refer to
   Schoebitz et al. [23].

2.2. Research Implementation

   The data collection took place between March and July 2015. A
   literature study and field observations were carried out to obtain an
   overview of the urban sanitation system and key stakeholders. A
   stakeholder analysis was conducted to assess the organisational
   structure, mode of operation, and responsibilities of faecal sludge
   emptying services. Collaborative working relationships were established
   to ensure transparent communication of the aims and objectives of the
   study, and to obtain permission of participants. Operating trucks,
   names of drivers, truck volume, working procedures, ownership, and
   association membership were recorded.

2.3. Data Collection

   Trucks of mechanical emptying service providers participating in the
   study were equipped with a GPS data logger GT-730FL-S (CanMore
   Electronics Co.; Zhubei, Taiwan). This data logger was connected to an
   XTPower MP 10400 powerbank (Model PB-AS025) (DBK Electronics Co.;
   Shenzhen, China), which served as an external battery to allow
   continuous recording for approximately 7.5 days. The data logger was
   configured to create a waypoint every ten seconds. Data loggers and
   batteries were stored in closable plastic containers, packed with paper
   to prevent moisture accumulation and to provide a buffer to external
   influences. The container was placed behind the driver’s seat and
   exchanged on a weekly basis. Battery exchange and data export were
   performed at the treatment plants during faecal sludge discharge or
   while the truck was waiting there for customers. To support this task,
   an employee of the association was appointed and remunerated.

2.4. Data Interpretation

   CanWay software (CanWay, version 1.1.12; (CanMore Electronics Co.;
   Zhubei, Taiwan, 2016) was used to export recorded waypoints from the
   data loggers and GPS data were analysed with ArcGIS (ArcGIS, version
   10.2.2; Esri: Redlands, CA, USA, 2013). For the identification of
   faecal sludge emptying events, Python scripts were developed. The
   travel velocity was calculated by dividing time and distance between
   two waypoints. Prior to implementation of the study, field testing was
   conducted to evaluate the potential for kinematic errors. Emptying
   events were simulated by stopping the truck. While stopped, errors
   showing movement of 1–3 km/h were occasionally observed. To account for
   this error, trucks were only recorded as moving if their velocity was
   greater than 4 km/h. For trucks belonging to either the Private
   Emptiers Association (PEA) or the Kampala Private Emptiers Association
   (KPEA), an emptying event was defined as a period of more than 15 min
   without movement. For trucks belonging to the Kampala Capital City
   Authority (KCCA) this period was reduced to 10 min, as it was observed
   that KCCA trucks required less time for the process of emptying the
   containment. In addition, the following events were filtered out from
   the analyses:
     * Any event between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., when the treatment plants are
       not open for discharge.
     * Any events longer than three hours, which were considered as
       waiting time.
     * Any events recorded at the treatment plant that were considered as
       discharge of faecal sludge or waiting time.

   To cross-check validity of the recorded emptying events, the total
   number was compared with obtained NWSC records from the treatment
   plants, where each discharge event is documented. In addition, factors
   that might affect the scale of emptying services were evaluated to
   determine the representativeness of the selected research period,
   including monthly precipitation (e.g., containment technologies fill up
   faster), increased income during crop harvest periods (e.g., increased
   income), and timing of school fees and public holidays (e.g.,
   decreasing emptying service requests due to extra expenditures).
   All identified emptying events that were recorded during the period of
   this research are provided as supplemental material to this paper,
   including year, month, day, and time, as well as the x- and
   y-coordinates of the event.

2.5. Data Analyses

   The following steps were performed to identify and interpret the scale
   of operation of mechanical faecal sludge emptying services:
     * GIS analyses of the spatial distribution of emptying events inside
       the boundaries of Kampala and the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
       Area, and outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area.
     * GIS analyses of service coverage in low-income informal settlements
       with KCCA statistics [24]. A 100 m buffer was added to the
       perimeter of the designated boundaries of informal settlements to
       account for their informal nature, which means they do not have
       precise boundaries and are difficult to map, show an uncontrolled
       sprawl, and experience rapid growth [25].
     * Identification of high-frequency emptying services. Locations with
       more than six recorded emptying events during the research period
       (i.e., more than two emptying events per month) where defined as
       such, indicating a non-household origin of faecal sludge.
     * Identification of areas without service provision during the study
       period. For analysis, a 0.5 × 0.5 km grid that divides the area of
       Kampala into 809 cells, each of 0.25 km^2, was projected over the
       city map. A cell was defined as an area without service provision
       if no emptying event took place during the three month research
       period. This grid was, furthermore, applied to classify these areas
       into areas with and without residents.
     * To analyse the scale of service provision on the parish level, the
       emptying frequency was calculated (Equation 1). Population and area
       are based on data obtained from Fichtner Water and Transportation
       [20].

   Areas with no residents, and previously identified locations with
   frequent emptying events, were excluded to ensure that the analyses
   were based only on household-level emptying services. R open-source
   software (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing,
   version 3.3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
   2016) was used for analyses [26].
   To evaluate how GIS analyses could contribute to optimisation of faecal
   sludge emptying, collection and transport logistics in Kampala, a
   location-allocation analysis was performed. For this analysis, the road
   network was used to identify the shortest travel distances between the
   currently operating treatment plants and the recorded emptying events.
   Distances between the treatment plants and emptying events where then
   compared with linear distances between emptying events and future
   treatment plants in Kinawataka and Nalukolongo. These treatment plants
   are currently planned under the Kampala Sanitation Program and will
   provide two additional discharge locations for emptying service
   providers [20].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Overview of Service Providers

   In total, 63 private faecal sludge emptying, collection and transport
   trucks are operating in Kampala, of which 25 are members of the PEA, 37
   of the KPEA, and one remains independent. KCCA, the public service
   provider, had four trucks in operation during the research period.
   These primarily operated within the public sector (e.g., schools,
   markets, public, and communal toilets). Emptying services in
   institutional, industrial, and commercial areas are performed by both
   private and public service providers [12].
   Depending on the truck volume, the trucks are operated by one driver
   and one to two assistants. Faecal sludge is transported either to
   Lubigi or Bugolobi treatment plants for discharge. At the time of the
   research, the discharge fee was USD 2.0–5.6, depending on the truck
   volume. In between service calls, while trucks are waiting, they are
   based at either of the treatment plants (23 at Bugolobi, 44 at Lubigi).
   Private service providers wait at the respective treatment plant for
   customer calls, whereas KCCA operates continuously with a defined list
   of customers to be serviced daily. Manual faecal sludge emptying
   services are available, however, data on the scale of operation is
   lacking [12].
   Private service providers are directly contacted by the customer and
   the fee for emptying services ranges from USD 17–28 per trip, depending
   on factors such as distance, truck volume, presence of solid waste in
   the containment, and density of sludge [12]. The existing truck volumes
   are: 2–3.9 m^3 (23 trucks), 4–5.9 m^3 (28 trucks), 6–7.9 m^3 (3
   trucks), and 8–11 m^3 (13 trucks).
   Private service providers report that factors such as timing of heavy
   rain, monthly pay day, harvest period, due date of school fees, and
   public holidays influence the frequency of emptying requests. However,
   based on NWSC records during the period of this study, none of these
   factors showed an indicative influence. It is possible that they do
   have an effect though, as these factors mainly affect households. In
   previous studies, up to 50% of faecal sludge discharged at treatment is
   from non-household sources, and so these types of household level
   influences may not be observable [23].

3.2. Scale of Operation

   In total, 34 out of 67 trucks operating at the time were equipped with
   GPS data loggers. KCCA trucks were equipped for a five week period,
   with all other trucks were equipped for twelve weeks. During the
   research period, 5’653 emptying events were recorded. The data were
   assumed to be representative of the patterns of service delivery for
   all trucks in the city, as 51% of all trucks that were monitored
   included representative numbers from a range of factors, which could
   affect the spatial distribution of emptying events. This included 56%
   of the trucks based at Bugolobi and 48% based at Lubigi, 64% of trucks
   belonging to the PEA and 38% belonging to the KPEA, and a range of
   operating truck volumes including 56% of 2–3.9 m^3 trucks, 46% of 4–5.9
   m^3 trucks, 100% of 6–7.9 m^3 trucks, and 38% of 8–11 m^3 trucks.
   Additionally, in comparison to NWSC records of discharge events at
   treatment, this study captured 65% of emptying services provided by
   private service providers and 112% by KCCA. Private service providers
   performed an average of 2.1 emptying events per truck per day, whereas
   KCCA trucks performed 5.8 events per truck per day. Reasons for this
   significant difference appear not to be that KCCA is more efficient in
   emptying, but in scheduling emptying events, as drivers are provided
   with a daily schedule and are providing services to containment
   technologies that are readily accessible. This indicates that private
   service providers could also potentially operate at increased capacity
   with more effective planning of emptying schedules, such as proposed
   call centres [27], which could also contribute to an increase in
   overall service delivery.

3.2.1. Spatial Distribution of Emptying Events

   An overview of all recorded emptying events, of which 73% were located
   within Kampala boundaries, 22% in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
   Area, and 5% outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area is provided
   in Figure 1 (for supplemental report with additional maps available,
   see [28]). Collected faecal sludge is most frequently transported to
   the closest treatment plant to the emptying location. Due to
   urbanisation, population growth and limited unoccupied areas within
   Kampala boundaries, it can be expected that demand for faecal sludge
   emptying services outside Kampala, but within the Greater Kampala
   Metropolitan Area, will continue to increase within the near future.
   This demonstrates the importance of thinking outside of political
   boundaries when planning for faecal sludge management infrastructure
   and emptying service delivery.

3.2.2. Service Coverage in Low-Income Informal Settlements

   As illustrated in Figure 2, 37% of all recorded emptying events were
   located within informal settlements. However, when considering this
   high frequency of emptying events population density should also be
   considered, and it should not be confused with adequate access to
   improved sanitation [29], as 68% of residents of informal settlements
   in Kampala share toilet facilities with an average of 82 users [18].
   The high frequency of emptying events are, therefore, explained by an
   inadequate number of toilet facilities per capita, resulting in overuse
   and rapid filling of containment technologies. The increased population
   density in informal settlements is also a factor for increased demand
   for emptying services, which is not fully captured in these numbers as
   manual emptying is also taking place where access to trucks is not
   feasible. Service provision in these areas could potentially be
   improved by linking manual and mechanical service provision with
   transfer stations.
   Information on volumes and filling rates of containment technologies in
   Kampala is, for the most part, not available [30]. Customers frequently
   do not know volumes of their faecal sludge containment and service
   providers have to estimate based on qualitative assumptions [12]. This
   illustrates the future need for more in-depth quantification and
   characterisation studies for the appropriate planning of faecal sludge
   management and sizing of treatment facilities.

3.2.3. High-Frequency Non-Household Emptying Services

   Of the 1525 (or 37%) recorded emptying events 98 were from customers
   with high-frequency emptying services. These locations were
   non-household sources (e.g., commercial establishments, workers in
   industries, public toilets), which have faecal sludge emptied much more
   frequently than household-level users. It is imperative to consider
   non-household faecal sludge quantities, as Kampala doubles in size
   during the day with people commuting into the city [17]. It can be
   expected that faecal sludge from non-household sources has different
   physico-chemical characteristics due to shorter retention times and
   different inputs to the containment (e.g., kitchen, bathing), which
   highlights the importance of carrying out quantification and
   characterisation on a scale that is relevant to planned infrastructure
   (e.g., city-wide or neighbourhood scale). Faecal sludge is highly
   variable due to factors that range widely at the household level, such
   as soil characteristics, ground water, system inputs, quality of
   construction, type of containment, and it is also not homogenised
   during transport in the sewer as is wastewater [4]. Not taking this
   into account can lead to inappropriate designs and management plans;
   for example, using literature values instead of actual local
   characteristics led to over-design of a treatment plant by 200% over
   capacity [31]. Accurate designs are important to ensure appropriate
   treatment performance, not waste financial resources, which, among
   other factors, contribute to sustainable long-term operation of faecal
   sludge treatment plants [32].

3.2.4. Areas without Service Provision

   As presented in Figure 3, 54.7 km^2, or 31%, of the Kampala area did
   not receive any service provision during this study. To evaluate
   service provision, areas within Central Division that are connected to
   the sewer and non-residential areas were removed, resulting in a total
   adjusted area of 23.6 km^2, or 13%. Obviously, it cannot be
   extrapolated that emptying could never occur in these areas. However,
   identification of urban areas without mechanical emptying service
   provision over a three month period is valuable for a service delivery
   assessment, to identify areas for priority interventions by the
   municipality, and to identify untapped markets that the private sector
   could fill. Parts of informal settlements that were difficult to access
   could be accessed with manual emptiers using semi-mechanised equipment
   (e.g., the Gulper), and mechanical service provision elsewhere [21].

3.2.5. Influence of Population Density on Frequency of Emptying

   Hypothetically, income, type of containment technology, and population
   density could be indicators for levels of service provision. For
   example, in low-income areas, residents are less able to afford
   emptying services, and/or locations are not accessible for trucks
   [7,21]. In areas where unlined pit latrines are the prevailing type of
   containment technology, faecal sludge is typically not serviced by
   mechanical emptying with trucks due to the risk of collapse during
   emptying [20,33]. In Kampala, population density is also an indicator
   of income level and containment technology. To further evaluate service
   provision at the household level in Kampala, the frequency of emptying
   events during this study was normalised to land area and 1000
   population equivalents on a parish level (Equation (1); data for
   analyses in supplementary material, 1000 was selected for ease of
   analysis) as defined by the following four levels of service delivery:
     * Low frequency: Emptying events > 0 < 50/1000 cap × ha
     * Medium frequency: Emptying events ≥ 50 < 200/1000 cap × ha
     * High frequency: Emptying events ≥ 200 < 500/1000 cap × ha
     * Very high frequency: Emptying events ≥ 500/1000 cap × ha

   As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, adjusting emptying events for
   population density reveals that areas that have the highest levels of
   service provision were in medium- and high-income areas (Figure 6) and
   these areas also have lower resident population densities. Parishes
   with the lowest levels of service provision were in low- and very
   low-income areas and have higher resident population densities. Even
   though 37% of all emptying events inside the Kampala boundaries were
   recorded in informal settlements, 32% of those were non-household
   sources of faecal sludge that were not included in this analysis. Based
   on this analysis, it appears that household-level users in informal
   settlements are greatly underserved by toilet facilities and also
   mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers. This is not
   surprising, as the cost for emptying events (USD 17 and USD 28 per
   trip) can be as high as half of the yearly household income in
   low-income areas [12,18]. These results could indicate that a
   significant proportion of accumulated faecal sludge in low-income areas
   ends up directly in the environment, which is in line with estimates of
   up to 75% of excreta in Kampala not being safely managed in very low-
   and low-income areas of Kampala [23]. Policies and regulations need to
   be developed for equitable access to sanitation, beyond just toilet
   facilities that also includes faecal sludge management.

3.3. Optimisation of Faecal Sludge Logistics

   An analysis of spatial GIS data can also be useful for reducing travel
   times and transport costs, thereby reducing overall costs of sanitation
   provision. Route analysis and road network modelling with hypothetical
   data of faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport is possible
   in regions with well-established road networks; for example, in
   Switzerland [34]. However, this relies on basic assumptions, such as
   consistent speed limits, fuel consumption, truck volumes, containment
   volumes, and reduced idling with increased density. These assumptions
   are simply not viable in dense, urban, low-income cities in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, where fully-functional road networks do not even exist, and
   possible routing changes are not predictable.
   As road network analysis was not considered viable, analysis was
   performed with linear distance as an indication of how much travel
   distances could be reduced with additional treatment plants. Figure 7
   illustrates linear distances between emptying events and present
   location of Lubigi and Bugolobi treatment plants (a) and linear
   distances between emptying events, present location of Lubigi treatment
   plant, and future location of Kinawataka and Nalukolongo treatment
   plants (b). Figure 7a shows all emptying events in this study with
   average linear distance to existing treatment plants, compared to
   Figure 7b that includes the three treatment plants that are planned in
   the Kampala Sanitation Program [20]. The analysis reveals a reduction
   in linear distance from 6.4 km to 5.4 km. As more information on
   infrastructure, daily quantities of faecal sludge produced and
   delivered, and the possibility of transfer stations becomes available,
   this type of analyses could greatly increase the overall efficiency
   when siting treatment plants and transfer stations. For transfer
   stations to be effective in reducing transport costs, it would require
   onsite dewatering and treatment of supernatant, with dewatered sludge
   being transferred to treatment plants. In addition to reducing
   transport times, distances, and costs, it is known that there is an
   economy of scale for the level of centralisation and decentralisation
   of treatment facilities which could also be optimised, in addition to
   strategies to meet growth [35]. However, identifying locations for
   treatment plants and transfer stations is also part of a complex
   decision-making process that in addition to distances includes factors,
   such as planning restrictions, residents’ influence on decision-making,
   and the cost of land [15].
   The use of GIS tools for optimisation of faecal sludge collection and
   transport at city-wide scale provides an opportunity to increase
   sustainability of the planning and decision-making process by
   increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge
   transport times and costs. The method is applicable anywhere, but
   variables need to be adapted to the local situation; for example,
   sufficiently detailed spatial data (e.g., GIS map layers or
   crowd-sourced information). However, the analyses in this study were
   limited to mechanical emptying service providers. To increase the
   benefits for planning of city-wide sanitation service provision, and
   the potential for optimisation, the methodology could be extended to
   include logistics of manual and informal emptying, direct discharges,
   and non-emptiable types of containment.

4. Conclusions

   The benefits of employing GIS analyses as a component of planning
   include:
     * Access to sanitation: Identifying areas that lack adequate access
       to sanitation for priority intervention by local municipalities to
       increase equity of service coverage.
     * Underserved areas: Identifying areas where manual or mechanical
       private entrepreneurs could profitably increase service provision,
       and increase access to faecal sludge management.
     * Future demand: Identifying areas with rapidly growing and high
       population densities with a need for increased service provision.
     * Identify service areas: Locating areas outside of the municipal
       boundaries, which are being served by treatment plants within
       boundaries.
     * Optimise locations: Siting of treatment plants and transfer
       stations to optimise transport distances could greatly reduce
       transport costs and impacts to traffic.
     * Quantification and characterisation: Identifying sources of faecal
       sludge, which could be combined with other tools to increase
       accuracy of quantification and characterisation for appropriate
       design.
     * Existing infrastructure: Optimising usage of existing
       infrastructure.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   :
   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer.

1. Introduction

   In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown consistent
   associations between exposure to air pollution and cardio-respiratory
   morbidity and mortality [1,2,3]. The effects were partially attributed
   to traffic-related air pollutants such as fine particles, diesel soot
   or ultrafine particles in ambient air as well as other indicators of
   road traffic exposures, such as living or working close to major roads
   or nitrogen oxides [4,5,6,7]. Besides other ambient particle sources
   including e.g. industry and domestic heating, traffic emissions are
   supposed to have a significant impact on the local air quality and to
   contribute to the observed adverse health effects on humans.
   In 1999, the European Commission established limit values for PM[10]
   and some other air pollutants in the Air Quality Daughter Directive
   1999/30/EC [8], which was replaced in 2008 by the new Directive
   2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe [9]. The
   existing air quality guidelines for PM[10] are currently being exceeded
   at many locations throughout Europe and Germany [10,11,12].
   As traffic emissions are among the main contributors to anthropogenic
   pollutant emissions in the urban air [13], the reduction of traffic
   emissions offers an efficient strategy for reducing PM[10] levels in
   urban air. One widely-used, non-technical measure to meet the policy
   targets for PM[10] is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs).
   In Germany, a LEZ is a defined area (mostly located around the city
   centre) where the vehicles that enter have to meet certain emissions
   standards. For entering the LEZ all vehicles have to be identified by
   color coded windscreen badges which are directly linked to the
   corresponding stages of European emission standards (Euro 2: red; Euro
   3: yellow; Euro 4: green). Petrol-driven vehicles equipped with a
   catalytic converter are principally assigned to the Euro 4 class and
   will be entitled to a green badge. In the first stage of operation all
   vehicles with a badge (red, yellow or green) are allowed to enter the
   LEZ. In stage 2, the LEZ can be accessed by vehicles displaying a
   yellow or green badge, whereas stage 3 of the LEZ allows access only to
   vehicles with a green badge.
   The first measure aiming reduction of PM[10] concentrations in ambient
   air in Munich was the introduction of a law forbidding transit of
   vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons through the city area on 1 February
   2008. This law forces all trucks without final destination in Munich to
   use the motorway ring A99 round around the city area. As a second
   measure the first stage of the LEZ became operative at 1 October 2008.
   In this stage, all vehicles with Euro 1 (or worse) were no longer
   allowed to enter and drive within the area of the LEZ. From 1 October
   2010 the second stage of the LEZ in Munich became effective; all
   vehicles with Euro 2 (red sticker or without any sticker) are not
   allowed to enter the LEZ. Stage 3 of the Munich LEZ has been in
   operation since 1 October 2012 and only vehicles with green batches are
   allowed within the LEZ.
   Currently, LEZs have been implemented in 13 European countries [14]. In
   Germany, 49 LEZs are in operation or in the planning stages [15]. Some
   local authorities in Germany estimated the expected impact of the LEZ
   on air quality prior to their implementation (mostly by dispersion
   modeling). The predicted reduction of PM[10] mass concentration in
   ambient air, which is currently regulated and therefore the focus of
   our examination, ranges from 2% to 10 % depending on the
   characteristics of the specific LEZ, its valid stage and the number of
   exceptional permissions for cars that fail to meet the required
   emission standards. However, the verifying of the predicted reduction
   of PM[10] levels by analyzing the measured PM[10] mass concentrations
   is difficult, due to large influence of meteorological conditions on
   the PM[10] levels [16].
   Several studies about the benefit of traffic regulation measures in
   European cities were already published. PM[10] and CO levels decreased
   after the introduction of the London congestion charging scheme [17,18]
   and PM[10] and NO[X] were reduced during a seven month test period of
   the congestion tax in Stockholm. Modest reductions in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5]were observed in four Danish cities as a consequence of the
   introduction of a LEZ [19]. Since the implementation of the London LEZ
   strong reductions of the particle number concentration were detected
   [20] and small changes in the PM concentration [21]. Boogaard et al.
   [22] found that local traffic policies were associated with reductions
   in PM[2.5] in five Dutch cities. In spite of the challenges, there have
   already been a few papers analyzing the effects of the German LEZs on
   the improvement of air quality [16,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. However,
   they mostly use rather simple (and varying) statistical approaches.
   Because these studies analyze different LEZs using different
   statistical methods, the results are difficult to compare insofar as
   different statistical approaches were used for the analyses.
   In the first study of LEZ impact in Munich, the adjustment for the
   influence of meteorological conditions on PM[10] levels was conducted
   with a reference monitoring station located in a regional background
   area close to the city [25]. A relative reduction of PM[10] levels has
   been seen at almost all involved monitoring sites and the relative
   decrease ranged from 5% up to 12 %. However, this analysis was applied
   on a rather short period and used descriptive statistical analyses
   only. Morfeld et al. [30] analysed the same data set using regression
   analyses for matched observations of subsequent years and have not
   found significant effects of the LEZ.
   In our study, we extended the period under investigation and improved
   the statistical approach of the analysis. We restrict here our analysis
   only on the PM[10] particle fraction. One reason for this restriction
   is that there are no data on other relevant particle characteristics
   (such as PM[2.5], Black Smoke or particle number concentration)
   available for Munich. Secondly, LEZs were introduced in Germany as a
   primary measure for reducing PM[10] and consequently the public debate
   about the effectiveness of LEZs is mainly focused on changes in this
   particle fraction. We compared the PM[10] concentrations before and
   after the LEZ implementation by applying of a semiparametric
   statistical model with first-order autoregressive errors on data in a
   time resolution of one hour. The estimated PM[10] levels were adjusted
   for PM[10] exposure at the reference station, wind direction, season,
   time throughout a week, and public holidays. Two questions were of
   interest: First, we investigated, whether a significant overall
   reduction of PM[10] levels adjusted for possible confounders could be
   detected following the implementation of the measures in Munich and
   whether the effect at the street site differed from the urban
   background site. Second, we examined the seasonal and diurnal variation
   of the air quality changes, which might have originated in the
   variations of the number of vehicles and of the composition of the
   vehicle fleet.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Area and Selection of the Monitoring Stations

   The study was conducted in Munich, Germany. In 2011, Munich had a
   population of approximately 1.41 million inhabitants in an area of
   310.4 km^2 and there were approximately 700,000 registered cars [31].
   The LEZ in Munich covers 44 km², which accounts for 14 % of the whole
   city area. However, 32 % of the city population lives in this area
   (Figure 1).

   Ijerph 11 05094 g001
   For our study, we obtained PM[10] data collected at two monitoring
   sites located within the LEZ: one urban background site, Lothstrasse
   (measurement height: 4 m over ground) and one street site,
   Prinzregentenstrasse (measurement height: 2.9 m over ground; distance
   to road: 3 m; 39,000 vehicles/day in 2007–2010) [32,33]. The local
   traffic contributes with 22 % to the PM[10] levels at the measurement
   site Prinzregentenstrasse and to 6 % at the site Lothstrasse [33]. A
   regional background site in the outskirts of the city and outside the
   LEZ in Johanneskirchen was selected as a reference site (measurement
   height: 4 m over ground; distance to road: 5 m). All three monitoring
   stations are operated by the Bavarian Environment Agency (Bayerisches
   Landesamt für Umwelt, Augsburg, Germany) as part of the Bavarian
   Monitoring System for Air Quality (LÜB: Lufthygienisches
   Landesüberwachungssystem Bayern) (Figure 1). The remaining three
   monitoring stations were not involved in the analysis and are not shown
   in Figure 1. Two of them (Luise-Kiesselbach-Platz, Landshuter Allee)
   are located at the border of the LEZ and one (Stachus) were excluded as
   construction and tram track maintenance was conducted between August
   2008 and April 2010 in the vicinity of this monitoring site.

2.2. Study Period and Data

   In our analysis, we compared the PM[10] concentrations measured prior
   to the implementation of any air quality measures (period 1) with the
   PM[10] levels measured after the measures became effective (period 2).
   Data on PM[10] mass concentrations in an hourly time resolution were
   used for the analysis. The analysis period 1 was selected from 1
   February 2006 until 31 January 2008. In the period between 1 February
   2008 and 30 September 2008, only a truck transit ban was effective.
   This period was excluded from the analysis because it was too short to
   draw general conclusions. The examination period 2 (both transit ban
   for heavy-duty vehicles and LEZ in stage 1 were effective) covered the
   rest of the data between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2010. PM[10]
   records at the Prinzregentenstrasse were only available until 31 June
   2010, because the station was closed. The PM[10] values on 1 January
   were excluded from the analysis for each year due to the traditional
   New Year’s Eve fireworks.
   Hourly measurements of the wind direction in 36 angle categories
   representative for the city of Munich (measured ca. 4 km northwest of
   the inner city of Munich) were obtained from the German National
   Meteorological Service.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

   The urban PM[10] levels were assumed to be mainly driven by the
   following factors: The measurements at the reference station
   represented the regional background pollution level, which was mostly
   not affected by the measures. Therefore, the PM[10] levels of the
   reference station reflected the changes of the PM[10] levels of the
   station of interest owing to meteorological conditions, the background
   PM[10] levels and long term temporal trends in PM[10]. Despite large
   scale effects of the wind direction, which were represented through the
   reference station, local effects of the wind direction occur due to the
   position of the measurement stations in the local vicinity, e.g.
   regarding to nearby factories or park areas.
   Since our data comprise only four years of measurements, long term
   temporal trends at the stations within the LEZ beyond the trends at the
   reference station could not be considered in the model and are of minor
   relevance. However, seasonal variation in PM[10] concentration occurred
   (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1), which possibly may change the
   effect of the measures. Hourly PM[10] levels are subject to daily
   cyclic variation due to heating and also due to traffic; therefore, the
   measures may also affect the temporal pattern of PM[10] levels. Public
   holidays during weekdays may yield deviations from the usual
   concentration levels.
   A semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors (refer to
   Clifford et al. [34] for a Bayesian implementation of a similar model
   for ultrafine particle number concentrations) was used to estimate the
   association between air pollution and the introduction of measures:
   log(PM[10x]) = β[0] + β[1] log(PM[10ref]) + β[SM] · I[SM] + β[W] · I[W]
   + β[WM] · I[WM] + f[S](hour) · I[S] + f[SM](hour) · I[SM] + f[W](hour)
   · I[W] + f[WM](hour) · I[WM] + f[wd](wind direction) + β[2](public
   holiday) + ε .
   (1)
   The effects of the corresponding covariates were denoted with β.The
   outcome variable was the logarithmically transformed PM[10] mass
   concentration at an urban station, which is denoted by log(PM[10][x]).
   I[S], I[W,] I[SM], I[WM] denote the indicator function for “summer
   without measures”, “winter without measures”, “summer with measures”
   and ”winter with measures”, respectively. The winter season was defined
   from October to March, the summer season from April to September.
   The following variables were considered as confounding factors:
   logarithmically transformed PM[10] levels at the reference station
   (log(PM[10][ref])), a smooth, cyclic effect based on P-splines with
   maximum four degrees of freedom of the wind direction, f[wd](wind
   direction), and an indicator for public holidays (public holiday).
   Adjusting for the PM[10] measurements at the reference station prevents
   from “regression to the mean” [35], improves the power of the model in
   comparison to the analysis of differences [36] and allows flexible and
   simple adjustments for other confounders. We selected the confounder
   variables by a priori considerations. Since we include an adjustment by
   the reference station with similar temperature and precipitation, we
   did not use these variables in the confounder model. Since wind
   direction has a local effect, which differs from the effect at the
   reference station, we included the variable wind direction in our
   model.
   In addition, the model was adjusted for deterministic seasonal
   components, similar to [37]. The effect of the measures (M) was
   analyzed separately for summer (S) and winter (W) to allow for seasonal
   variability. Daily and daytime-specific deviations were modeled with an
   hourly-resolved weekly season-specific trend, f[S](hour) · I[S],
   f[SM](hour) · I[SM], f[W](hour) · I[W], f[WM](hour) · I[WM] Cyclic
   penalized splines were used as basis functions for a smooth
   nonparametric estimation. Permitting a maximum number of 49 degrees of
   freedom, the model reached enough flexibility to describe the daytime
   dependent variability of the traffic.
   Percentage changes of PM[10] levels were modeled through logarithmic
   concentration levels [37]. In particular, it was suggested that the
   measures, the public holidays and the seasons yielded to percentage
   effects on the PM[10] concentration.
   Note, that the usage of the semiparametric model lessens the problem of
   scale. Furthermore, the highly skewed distribution of the PM[10] mass
   concentration was another reason for using the logarithmic
   transformation.
   Since the measurements are not independent, an autoregressive process
   of order 1 is simultaneously modeled for the error term ε.
   The overall effect of the measures was examined for each of the two
   seasons with a test on the hypotheses whether the effect coefficients
   for winter and summer differ between the periods with and without
   measures:
   H[0] : β[W] = β[WM],β[SM] = 0
   (2)
   Day-specific effects were investigated using an appropriate linear
   combination of the effect coefficients, representing the area between
   the smooth effect with and without measures. The inference for the
   day-specific effects was based on the asymptotic normality of linear
   combinations (for more details see Supplemental Material, “Modelling of
   day specific effects”).
   Statistical calculations were conducted using R [38], version 2.15.3;
   semiparametric models were estimated with the package “mgcv” [39],
   version 1.7-22.

3. Results

3.1. Data Description

   Figure 2 shows the weekly means of PM[10] concentrations at the two
   monitoring sites within the LEZ (Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse)
   and at the reference site in Johanneskirchen. Weekly means were chosen
   to display the trend of PM[10] levels for reasons of clarity and
   reducing the point-to-point variation.

   The PM[10] concentrations were higher in the winter season and lower in
   the summer season. In particular, elevated PM[10] levels were observed
   between January and March. The means of the unadjusted PM[10] mass
   concentrations before and after the implementation of measures are
   given in Table 1.
   At both urban stations, a decrease of PM[10] in period 2 (compared to
   period 1) was observed. The decrease at Prinzregentenstrasse (−14.0% in
   summer, −1.9% in winter) was larger in summer and similar in winter as
   at Lothstrasse (−2.3% in summer, −2.5% in winter). At the reference
   station in Johanneskirchen, also differences between the two periods
   were detected (−2.1% in summer, −0.8% in winter). The PM[10]
   concentration was on average 27.6% at Prinzregentenstrasse and 12.5% at
   Lothstrasse higher (median percentage difference) than at the reference
   station. While considering mere mean concentrations the impact of
   confounding factors like meteorological conditions were disregarded;
   the regression analysis in section 3.2 allowed for these confounders.
   The Spearman correlation coefficients between the hourly means of
   PM[10]concentration measured at the three monitoring sites were high
   and ranged from 0.69 to 0.88, the correlations between the daily
   averages were even slightly stronger (ranged from 0.83 to 0.96). The
   hourly PM[10] concentrations at the three monitoring sites were highly
   autocorrelated with autocorrelation coefficients between 0.87 and 0.92.
   The temporal trend of the annual means observed at the urban background
   site Lothstrasse and the regional background site (as the reference
   site) in Johanneskirchen was very similar. It indicates that both sites
   were not influenced by any local sources of PM. Even more, the PM[10]
   values obtained at the measurement site in Johanneskirchen were very
   similar and strong correlated with the PM[10] values observed at a
   regional background site located at the campus of the Bavarian Agency
   for Environmental Protection in Augsburg, Germany (about 90 km linear
   distance from Johanneskirchen).

3.2. Statistical Modeling

   According to equation (1), the PM[10] concentrations at a specific
   monitoring site were calculated for “summer without measures” and
   “winter without measures” as well as “summer with measures” and “winter
   with measures”, respectively. In Table 2, the relative differences
   between the periods with and without measures are shown for
   Prinzregentenstrasse (street site) and Lothstrasse (urban background
   site), and indicated separately for the summer and winter season.

   Note: adjusted for exposure at the reference station, wind direction,
   day of the week, time of the day and public holidays.
   The effects of the air quality measures differ at the two measurement
   stations as well as between the seasons. A stronger reduction in PM[10]
   mass concentrations was observed at the street site; on average 19.6%
   (5.4 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.001) in summer and 6.8% (2.1 µg/m^3, p-value:
   <0.001) in winter, respectively. At the urban background site
   Lothstrasse smaller decreases were estimated: 5.73% (1.1 µg/m^3,
   p-value: <0.001) in summer and 3.18% (0.7 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.003) in
   winter. If we had not have determined separate effects for the two
   seasons, the reduction of the PM[10] concentration by the measures at
   Prinzregentenstrasse would have been estimated with 13.0% (p-value:
   <0.001) and with 4.5%; (p-value: <0.001) at Lothstrasse.
   Figure 3 shows the temporal patterns of the modeled PM[10]
   concentrations at Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse for the periods
   with and without measures (adjusted for PM[10] concentration at the
   reference station, wind direction and public holidays). Temporal
   variability of PM[10] levels occurred between the seasons, the weekdays
   and times of day. The concentrations were higher in the winter months.
   The morning and afternoon rush hour peaks during the working days were
   clearly visible especially at Prinzregentenstrasse. The morning peak in
   the summer months was more clearly separated from the afternoon peak as
   in the winter season. The efficiency of the measures depended on the
   time of the day (see also Supplemental Material, Figure S2) and
   followed a diurnal pattern. Due to the implemented measures the PM[10]
   burden was stronger reduced during hours with higher relative and
   absolute PM[10] mass concentration, i.e. between the morning and
   afternoon rush hour peaks. The rush hour peaks themselves were reduced
   and there seemed to be lesser spillover from the morning to the
   afternoon. Furthermore, the improving of air quality during the nights
   on workdays was faster at the street site. The effect of the measures
   vanishes during night-time of the first days of the working week.
   The mean daily effects of both measures (stratified by season and week
   day) are shown in Figure 4 for each day of the week separately. In the
   summer season, the effect of the measures for each day of the week was
   at the street site stronger than in winter, whereas this tendency is
   not observed at the background site. However, at both sites the
   strongest effects were observed on Fridays (−25.0% in summer and −16.4%
   in winter at street site, −8.2% in summer and −6.1% in winter at the
   background site) and Saturdays (−25.9% in summer at street site, −11.4%
   in summer and −5.3% in winter at the background site). On Sunday a
   strong seasonal dependency of the effect was observed: the measures
   were only effective in summer.
   The effects of the linearly modeled confounding covariates are
   displayed in Supplemental Material, Table S1. The logarithmic values of
   the reference station had a significant, additive effect of log(1.381)
   = 0.323 at Prinzregentenstrasse and log(1.972) = 0.679 at Lothstrasse.
   Public holidays led to a reduction of PM[10] levels in the ambient air
   by approximately 13%. Since the estimated autocorrelation coefficient
   was relatively high (Prinzregentenstrasse: ρ = 0.70, Lothstrasse: ρ =
   0.54), the bigger part of the autocorrelation of the PM[10]
   measurements could not be explained through the inclusion of the smooth
   components in the predictor. The model for the measurements at
   Prinzregentenstrasse explained 74.5% of the variability in the data and
   the model for the Lothstrasse 83.0%.
   The shape of the smooth effect of wind direction indicates decreased
   PM[10] levels, if the wind blew from the South or West at Lothstrasse
   and if the wind blew from North or East at Prinzregentenstrasse (data
   not shown). We focused our analysis on PM[10], because the reason for
   the establishment of the LEZ exceeded PM[10] limit values.

4. Discussion

4.1. Impact of the Measures on PM[10] Mass Concentration

   We investigated whether changes in PM[10] levels after the introduction
   of a truck transit ban through the city area and the implementation of
   the first stage of the LEZ in Munich could be detected by analysis of
   emission data on PM[10] mass concentration collected at an urban
   background and a street monitoring site. The comparison of the PM[10]
   mass concentrations (adjusted for exposure at the reference station,
   wind direction, day of the week, time of the day and public holidays
   and calculated separately for summer and winter seasons in a
   semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors) showed a
   large relative decrease of PM[10] levels at the street site (13.0%,
   p-value: <0.001), whereas the relative decrease observed at the urban
   background monitoring site was smaller (4.5%, p-value: <0.001). The
   decrease of PM[10] mass concentration predicted in Munich by dispersion
   modeling ranges between 2% and 10 % depending on the monitoring sites
   and the active stage of the LEZ [40]. The maximal reduction (up to 10
   %) was predicted only for the third stage of the LEZ. The changes of
   PM[10] concentrations detected at the street site in our study are
   larger than the reductions predicted a priori and are also larger than
   those observed in the most other German cities [16,23,24,26,27,28,29].
   In general, the implementation of LEZ could influence the composition
   of the car fleet as well as the traffic intensity. The percentage of
   registered vehicles without any badge (Euro 1 or less) decreased during
   the time period 2007–2010 from 9.2% to 2.5% for passenger cars and from
   31.5% to 24.1% for trucks, respectively. In the same time the
   percentage of vehicles with green badge increased from 78.4% to 89.6%
   for passenger cars and from 19.0% to 36.1% for trucks, respectively.
   Those changes are especially pronounced between the years 2007 and
   2008, it means immediately before the implementation of the LEZ in
   Munich [41]. Such an extraordinary modernization of vehicle fleet in
   the city towards low-emission cars was reported also for Berlin [28].
   Note that there is only information about the in Munich registered
   vehicles; no such information is available about the car fleet
   composition in flowing traffic in the city. Regarding the flowing
   traffic it can be assumed that the older vehicles are less often in use
   compared to the newer vehicles.
   For the dispersion modelling, it was assumed that the traffic intensity
   remained constant over the time period 2007–2010. However, the analyses
   presented here are not only considering the impact of the LEZ alone,
   but also the additional impact of the transit ban for all trucks. The
   transit ban for trucks could affect the PM[10] levels even to a larger
   extent than the LEZ, which operated in the analyzed period in the first
   stage only. It leads not solely to a reduction of particles emitted by
   vehicle exhaust, but also to a reduction of particles originated from
   tyre and brake wear or dust re-suspension. Due to the ban on driving
   for trucks on Sunday, the effect for Sunday can be directly ascribed to
   the implementation of the LEZ. A similar pattern was found for
   Saturday, but only at Prinzregentenstrasse. This lead us to the
   assumption that in winter, the vehicle fleet on weekends in the city
   and on Sundays in the urban background was the same before and after
   the introduction of the LEZ, whereas this was not the case during the
   summer season.
   In the previous study estimating the LEZ impact in Munich, a slightly
   weaker effect of 12.3% relative reduction of PM[10] mass concentration
   at Prinzregentenstrasse was found [25]. The analysis was based on the
   comparison of relative PM[10] concentration changes by a reference
   station. However, such analysis of the quotient between the specific
   monitoring station and the reference station neglects the uncertainty
   of the measurements at the reference station. Further regression
   analyses on the ratio as used in the previous study revealed a
   comparably poor model fit (data not shown). This is also denoted by the
   strong deviation of the estimation of the intercept from 1 in our
   analysis. For comparison, we also analyzed the same period as described
   in Cyrys et al. [25] by use of the model applied in our study. We only
   found negligible (statistically insignificant) changes of the PM[10]
   mass concentration (Prinzregenstrasse −1.05%, p-value: 0.855;
   Lothstrasse: 2.42%, p-value: 0.499), as it was similarly found by
   Morfeld et al. [30]. For further comparisons of the approach used in
   our study with other modelling approaches we refer to the “comparison
   of different modeling approaches” section in the Supplemental Material.
   The results of our study are not directly comparable to the results
   obtained for other measures of traffic reduction, which were already
   introduced in some European cities. We analyzed here the common effect
   of the implementation of LEZ and transit ban for trucks in Munich and
   we are aware that such combination is not that common. Even if we might
   be able to evaluate the effects of the LEZ and transit ban for trucks
   separately, the comparison with other cites might remain difficult, as
   the regulations and areas of LEZ’s differ from city to city. The
   following discussion should compare rather roughly the range of the
   effects observed for different measures across Europe. Several studies
   analyzed the impact of congestion charging in London [17,18,42].
   Atkinson et al. [17] observed reductions in PM[10] only at the
   background monitor. The study conducted by Beevers and Carslaw [18]
   indicated that NO[x] and PM[10] emissions have been reduced by about
   12% in the charging zone, whereas the study of Tonne et al. [42] showed
   that the congestion charge schema led to only modest reductions in air
   pollutant concentrations across Greater London, but greater reductions
   in the charging zone. Ellison et al. [21] found that the LEZ in London
   had a significant effect on the composition of the vehicle fleet in
   London and reduced the PM[10] concentrations.
   Johansson and colleagues [43] assessed the effect of traffic congestion
   in Stockholm and concluded that the annual average NO[x] and PM[10]
   concentrations along the most densely trafficked streets would be lower
   by up to 12% and 7%, respectively. Note that the effects in the studies
   of Beevers and Carslaw [18], Tonne et al. [42] and Johansson et al.
   [43] were analyzed by dispersion modelling combined with regression
   calculation and were not verified by air quality measurements. PM[2.5]
   concentrations in Copenhagen were reduced by 5% after the introduction
   of the LEZ [19]. Unadjusted mean pollutants concentrations were lower
   after the implementation of the LEZ in five Dutch cities; the reduction
   in PM[2.5] levels was larger at urban streets (31%) than in the
   suburban background (20%) [22].
   The public debate is often focused solely on PM[10] concentrations (as
   this parameter is currently regulated) without taking into account that
   only the toxic fraction of PM[10] causes adverse human health effects
   [2,3,16]. Due to combustion processes particles originating from
   traffic exhibit a higher toxicity than particles from other sources;
   especially diesel-engine vehicles, which produce about 12% of the mean
   PM[10] exposure of the German population [44], emit these more toxic
   particles.
   Hence, the effectiveness of LEZ could be analyzed more precisely if
   Black Smoke (as marker for diesel soot) or the organic fraction of
   particles would be measured in ambient air instead of total PM[10]
   concentration [16]. Unfortunately, in Germany no routine measurements
   of Black Smoke concentrations in ambient air are conducted. Quadir and
   colleagues [45] reported recently significant lower concentrations for
   elemental carbon and some of particulate organic compounds after the
   introduction of the LEZ in Munich (the data were collected during
   special monitoring campaigns and not routinely by the monitoring
   network). Source apportionment analysis showed a reduction of traffic
   factor contribution by 60% after the implementation of the LEZ [45].
   Also in Berlin the concentration of soot particles decreased 2010 by
   52% compared with 2007 [29]. As climatic conditions in the years
   2008–2010 were adverse when compared to 2007, the authors attribute
   these results to the reduced traffic soot emissions. Currently, a
   debate about the pollution through PM[2.5] emerges, but the data
   material is insufficient because the monitoring of PM[2.5] is only at
   its early stages.
   In addition to dispersion modelling, estimating the expected changes of
   PM[10] mass concentration in the ambient air, our analysis evaluates
   the effects of the measures by analysis of the measured PM[10] values.
   However, the limitation of this strategy is, that also long-term
   changes of PM[10], which could not be explained by the included
   predictors, especially by the PM[10] levels of the reference station
   (for example changes in heating habits), are completely attributed to
   the LEZ effect.

4.2. Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of the Changes in PM[10] Levels

   The second objective of this study was the examination of the seasonal
   and diurnal variation of the detected air quality improvements. The
   extent of the PM[10] reduction at the background sites was largely
   similar in both seasons. In the urban background, exhaust particles
   represent a smaller fraction of fine particles compared to street site
   and the composition of particles varies less between winter and summer.
   On the contrary the difference between the two seasons was more
   pronounced at the street site, where the overall reduction of PM[10]
   mass concentrations was considerable larger as at the background site.
   At this site, the reduction of PM[10] levels due to the measures was
   larger during the summer season and smaller during the winter season.
   In winter, additional particle sources (such as domestic heating, wood
   combustion or combustion of other fossil fuels) contribute
   significantly to the PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air.
   Also the contribution of re-suspended dust to fine particles
   concentration in the ambient air increases in winter due to the
   application of road salt for deicing. In addition, the generation of
   secondary aerosols such as nitrate or sulfate is more intensive in
   winter. Consequently, exhaust particles represent a smaller fraction of
   the fine particles in winter than in summer. Therefore, the measures
   regulating only the exhaust particles became less effective in the
   winter period. In addition, adverse meteorological conditions leading
   to increased PM[10] levels from local mobile as well as stationary
   sources are occurring more frequently in the winter season. Our
   analysis suggests that in such episodes the influence of the
   implemented measures regulating the car exhaust is limited and that air
   quality is dominated by other unaffected mobile and stationary sources.
   The reduced rush hour peaks may indicate that a larger proportion of
   old cars no longer accessed the city during midday. Alternatively, the
   contribution of aged particles from the morning rush hours during day
   and night time might be shifted due to the reduction in diesel
   particles. Further, the temporal varying effect of the measures could
   be caused by the same reason as the differences between winter and
   summer season. One has to keep in mind that the morning and afternoon
   rush hour peaks seem to be more separated in summer not due to
   differences in traffic flow between summer and winter, but as a result
   of the combination of increased traffic intensity and increased solar
   radiation in summer.

5. Conclusions

   In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of two measures (a truck
   transit ban through the city area and implementation of LEZ) on the
   reduction of PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air in Munich,
   Germany. The analysis of the routinely collected PM[10] mass
   concentrations data by a semiparametric regression model showed
   statistically significant reduction of PM[10] levels at a monitoring
   site located in the direct vicinity of a highly frequented road and to
   a lesser extent at an monitoring site located in the urban background.
   The statistical regression modeling was essential to identify the size
   of the effect. The magnitude of the effect at the street site was
   larger in summer season; smaller seasonal variation was observed at the
   urban background site. In general, the magnitude of the effect depends
   on day of the week, time of the day and location of the monitoring
   site.
   Our analysis indicates that the assessment of the impact of measures
   aiming improvement of air quality in urban air could be conducted by
   use of routinely collected PM[10] data. However, as the expected
   reduction of PM[10] concentration after implementation of LEZ is in
   order of about 10%, the evaluation of this measure by PM[10] data
   remains difficult; other particulate variables, such as PM[2.5], Black
   Smoke, or particulate organic compounds are recommended for such
   evaluation.

Abstract

   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs. View Full-Text

   Abstract
   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve

   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve
   the surveillance of adverse events following the
   measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) tetravalent vaccine that was
   provided in the official immunization schedule of some Italian regions
   for children during the second year of life. This recommendation was
   based on data from some surveys that showed an additional risk of
   seizure following the administration of this vaccine. Responding to the
   Ministry commitment, the Puglia Region launched, from May 2017 to
   November 2018, a post-marketing active surveillance program of adverse
   events following MMRV immunization (AEFIs). Immunized children (second
   year of life) were enrolled on a voluntary basis, AEFIs diaries were
   used, and their parents were interviewed 25 days after the
   immunization. There were 2540 children enrolled; 2149/2540 (84.6%)
   completed the post-vaccination follow-up. Of these, 992 AEFIs were
   registered with a reporting rate of 46.2 × 100 doses: 883/992 (89.0%)
   AEFIs were not serious, while 109/992 (11.0%) were serious. For serious
   AEFIs, the evaluation of causality assessment was performed using the
   algorithm proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO): 82/109
   consistent causal associations to MMRV immunization were detected
   (reporting rate of consistent AEFIs: 3.8 × 100 follow-up). All serious
   AEFIs consistently associated with immunization resulted completely
   resolved at the follow-up. The reporting rate of seizure consistently
   associated with immunization was 0.05 × 100, lower than data previous
   published in the literature that did not report the causality
   assessment. Because no emerging signals were detected, our data from
   the active surveillance program confirmed the safety profile of the
   MMRV vaccine. Full article

   The activation of halogen bonding by the substitution of the
   pentafluoro-λ^6-sulfanyl (SF[5]) group was studied using a series of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes. The simulated electrostatic potential
   values of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes, the ab initio molecular
   orbital calculations of intermolecular interactions of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes with pyridine, and the ^13C-NMR
   titration experiments of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes in the presence
   of pyridine or tetra (n-butyl) ammonium chloride (TBAC) indicated the
   obvious activation of halogen bonding, although this was highly
   dependent on the position of SF[5]-substitution on the benzene ring. It
   was found that 3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene was the most effective halogen
   bond donor, followed by o-SF[5]-substituted iodobenzene, while the m-
   and p-SF[5] substitutions did not activate the halogen bonding of
   iodobenzenes. The similar ortho-effect was also confirmed by studies
   using a series of nitro (NO[2])-substituted iodobenzenes. These
   observations are in good agreement with the corresponding Mulliken
   charge of iodine. The 2:1 halogen bonding complex of
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) was
   also confirmed. Since SF[5]-containing compounds have emerged as
   promising novel pharmaceutical and agrochemical candidates, the
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene unit may be an attractive fragment of
   rational drug design capable of halogen bonding with biomolecules. Full

   Background and Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT)
   are characterized by cell damage caused by inflammatory and metabolic
   mechanisms induced by alteration in reduction-oxidative status. Serum
   advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are new markers of protein
   damage induced by oxidative stress. We evaluated serum levels of AOPP
   in a cohort of patients with DM and HT, with or without renal
   complications, compared with a control healthy population. Materials
   and Methods: The study group comprised of 62 patients with type 2 DM
   and 56 with HT. The 62 patients affected by DM were further
   distinguished in 24 subjects without renal impairment, 18 with diabetic
   nephropathy (DN), 20 with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2–3
   secondary to DN. The subgroup of 56 patients with primary HT comprised
   26 subjects without renal complications and 30 with CKD (stage 2–3)
   secondary to HT. Thirty healthy controls, matched for age and sex, were
   recruited among blood donors. Results: Increased AOPP levels were found
   in DM patients compared with healthy subjects, although not
   significantly. This index was higher and more significant in patients
   with DN and CKD secondary to DN than in DM patients without nephropathy
   (p < 0.05) or controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with HT and with kidney
   impairment secondary to HT also had significantly higher AOPP serum
   levels than controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There
   were no significant differences in mean AOPP levels among DM and HT
   patients. Conclusion: Our study showed that oxidative stress was higher
   in diabetic or hypertensive subjects than in healthy controls and, in
   particular, it appeared to be more severe in patients with renal
   complications. We suggest that the assessment of AOPP in diabetic and
   hypertensive patients may be important to predict the onset of renal
   failure and to open a new perspective on the adoption of antioxidant
   molecules to prevent CKD in those settings. Full article

   Helicobacter pylori infection is a WHO class 1 carcinogenic factor of
   gastric adenocarcinoma. In the past decades, many studies have
   demonstrated the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance and pointed
   out the necessity of new effective treatment. This study was aimed at
   identifying phytochemicals that can inhibit H. pylori and possibly
   serve as adjuvant treatments. Here, in silico molecular docking and
   drug-like properties analyses were performed to identify potential
   inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and aspartate-semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase. These three enzymes are targets of the treatment of H.
   pylori. Susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed on the
   selected phytochemicals and the positive control antibiotic,
   amoxicillin. The in-silico study revealed that oroxindin, rosmarinic
   acid and verbascoside are inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and
   aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, in which, oroxindin
   has the highest potency against H. pylori, indicated by a minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 50 μg/mL. A combination of
   oroxindin and amoxicillin demonstrated additive effects against H.
   pylori, as indicated by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)
   value of 0.75. This study identified phytochemicals that deserve
   further investigation for the development of adjuvant therapeutic
   agents to current antibiotics against H. pylori. Full article

   Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary approach
   to cancer therapy that requires accumulation of boron atoms
   preferentially in tumour cells. This can be achieved by using
   nanoparticles as boron carriers and taking advantage of the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Here, we present the
   preparation and characterization of size and shape-tuned gold NPs
   (AuNPs) stabilised with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized
   with the boron-rich anion cobalt bis(dicarbollide), commonly known as
   COSAN. The resulting NPs were radiolabelled with ^124I both at the core
   and the shell, and were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of human
   fibrosarcoma (HT1080 cells) using positron emission tomography (PET).
   Methods: The thiolated COSAN derivatives for subsequent attachment to
   the gold surface were synthesized by reaction of COSAN with
   tetrahydropyran (THP) followed by ring opening using potassium
   thioacetate (KSAc). Iodination on one of the boron atoms of the cluster
   was also carried out to enable subsequent radiolabelling of the boron
   cage. AuNPs grafted with mPEG-SH (5 Kda) and thiolated COSAN were
   prepared by ligand displacement. Radiolabelling was carried out both at
   the shell (isotopic exchange) and at the core (anionic absorption) of
   the NPs using ^124I to enable PET imaging. Results: Stable gold
   nanoparticles simultaneously functionalised with PEG and COSAN
   ([email protected][4]^−) with hydrodynamic diameter of 37.8 ± 0.5 nm,
   core diameter of 19.2 ± 1.4 nm and ξ-potential of −18.0 ± 0.7 mV were
   obtained. The presence of the COSAN on the surface of the NPs was
   confirmed by Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
   [email protected][4]^− could be efficiently labelled with ^124I both at
   the core and the shell. Biodistribution studies in a xenograft mouse
   model of human fibrosarcoma showed major accumulation in liver, lungs
   and spleen, and poor accumulation in the tumour. The dual labelling
   approach confirmed the in vivo stability of the [email protected][4]^−.
   Conclusions: PEG stabilized, COSAN-functionalised AuNPs could be
   synthesized, radiolabelled and evaluated in vivo using PET. The low
   tumour accumulation in the animal model assayed points to the need of
   tuning the size and geometry of the gold core for future studies. Full

   The efficacy of radiosurgery for neurofibromatosis type 2
   (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) remains debatable. We
   retrospectively analyzed radiosurgical outcomes for NF2-associated VS
   compared to sporadic VS using our database of 422 consecutive VS
   patients. Twenty-five patients with 30 NF2-associated VSs with a mean
   follow-up of 121 months were identified. NF2-associated VSs exhibited
   excellent tumor control (10-year cumulative rate, 92% vs. 92% in
   sporadic VSs; p = 0.945) and worse overall survival (73% vs. 97%; p =
   0.005), mainly due to tumor progression other than the treated VSs. The
   presence of NF2 was not associated with failed tumor control via
   multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses. No difference in
   radiation-induced adverse events (RAEs) was confirmed between cohorts,
   and prescription dose (hazard ratio 8.30, 95% confidence interval
   3.19–21.62, p < 0.001) was confirmed as a risk for cranial nerve
   injuries via multivariate analysis. Further analysis after propensity
   score matching using age, volume, and sex as covariates showed that
   NF2-associated VSs exhibited excellent local control (100% vs. 93%; p =
   0.240) and worse overall survival (67% vs. 100%; p = 0.002) with no
   significant difference in RAEs. Excellent long-term tumor control and
   minimal invasiveness may make radiosurgery a favorable therapeutic
   option for NF2 patients with small to medium VS, preferably with
   non-functional hearing or deafness in combination with postoperative
   tumor growth or progressive non-operated tumors, or with functional
   hearing by patients’ wish. Full article

   Celecoxib (CEL) Nanocrystalline Solid Dispersion (CEL_NCSD) was
   generated by spray drying CEL, mannitol (MAN) and sodium lauryl sulfate
   (SLS) from a solvent mixture of methanol, acetone and water. The
   purpose of the work was to determine the size of CEL nanocrystals,
   investigate agglomeration and inspect dissolution of CEL_NCSD. Size
   determination was challenging as CEL nanocrystals are embedded in the
   matrix of MAN. Firstly, neat CEL_NCSD was analyzed using Scherrer
   equation. Secondly, MAN was dissolved in an aqueous stabilizer medium
   to selectively measure the size of CEL nanocrystals. Raman Spectra
   captured in Morphologi G3-ID confirmed the presence of CEL-only
   particles in the media. This dispersion gave D[90] values of 882 ±
   170.34 nm in Zetasizer. Discriminatory dissolution studies confirmed
   total release of 34.61 ± 1.59%, 47.42 ± 0.24%, and 44.61 ± 1.11% at 120
   min from a microsuspension (size 3 µm), a nanosuspension (media milled;
   size 660 nm) and CEL_NCSD, respectively. The dissolution profile of
   CEL_NCSD was similar to that of a nanosuspension (f2 72.24) instead of
   a coarse microsuspension. Thus, the present study revealed that
   optimized sample preparation is critical for the size determination of
   embedded drug nanocrystals in NCSD. Further, a discriminatory
   dissolution study substantiated that the size of CEL nanocrystals in
   CEL_NCSD is well below 1000 nm, thus showing a size-dependent improved
   dissolution profile. Full article

   The detection of shedded fibers in effluents from textile washing has
   attracted much attention due to its reported contribution to
   microplastic pollution. Commonly used analytical methods for fiber
   detection in liquids are based on filtration with subsequent
   microscopic analysis and/or gravimetric weighing. These approaches are
   time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an approach based on
   dynamic image analysis was applied in order to set up an efficient
   method to analyze fibers in effluents from washing processes. In an
   initial validation step, reliable information on the counts of fibers
   and the morphological characteristics were confirmed. For wastewaters
   from polyester-cotton blends, the chemical nature of the fiber debris
   (natural vs. synthetic origin) was determined by combining the dynamic
   image analysis with a chemical pre-treatment. In this study, dynamic
   image analysis was revealed as a rapid, non-destructive, precise, and
   reliable technology for the characterization and quantification of the
   fiber debris, offering a promising approach for fiber analysis in
   liquids. Full article

   In recent years, liver injury induced by Traditional Chinese Medicines
   (TCMs) has gained increasing attention worldwide. Assessing the
   hepatotoxicity of compounds in TCMs is essential and inevitable for
   both doctors and regulatory agencies. However, there has been no
   effective method to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs
   available until now. In the present study, we initially built a large
   scale dataset of drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs). Then, 13 types of
   molecular fingerprints/descriptors and eight machine learning
   algorithms were utilized to develop single classifiers for DILI, which
   resulted in 5416 single classifiers. Next, the NaiveBayes algorithm was
   adopted to integrate the best single classifier of each machine
   learning algorithm, by which we attempted to build a combined
   classifier. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
   curve of the combined classifier were 72.798, 0.732, 0.724, and 0.793,
   respectively. Compared to several prior studies, the combined
   classifier provided better performance both in cross validation and
   external validation. In our prior study, we developed a
   herb-hepatotoxic ingredient network and a herb-induced liver injury
   (HILI) dataset based on pre-clinical evidence published in the
   scientific literature. Herein, by combining that and the combined
   classifier developed in this work, we proposed the first instance of a
   computational toxicology to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs.
   Then Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PmT) was used as a case to
   investigate the reliability of the approach proposed. Consequently, a
   total of 25 ingredients in PmT were identified as hepatotoxicants. The
   results were highly consistent with records in the literature,
   indicating that our computational toxicology approach is reliable and
   effective for the screening of hepatotoxic ingredients in Pmt. The
   combined classifier developed in this work can be used to assess the
   hepatotoxic risk of both natural compounds and synthetic drugs. The
   computational toxicology approach presented in this work will assist
   with screening the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs, which will further
   lay the foundation for exploring the hepatotoxic mechanisms of TCMs. In
   addition, the method proposed in this work can be applied to research
   focused on other adverse effects of TCMs/synthetic drugs. Full article

   Diet plays a decisive role in heart physiology, with lipids having
   especial importance in pathology prevention and development. This study
   aimed to investigate how dietary lipids varying in lipid profile
   (virgin olive oil, sunflower oil or fish oil) affected the heart of
   rats during aging. Heart histopathology, mitochondrial morphometry, and
   oxidative status were assessed. Typical histopathological features
   associated with aging, such as valvular lesions, endomyocardical
   hyperplasia, or papillary muscle calcification, were found at a low
   extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was
   that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to
   the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level, heart mitochondrial
   area, perimeter, and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than
   in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers,
   there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity,
   lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil.
   In summary, dietary intake for a long period on dietary fats with
   different fatty acids profile led to differences in some aspects
   associated with the aging process at the heart. Fish oil seems to be
   the fat most protective of heart during aging. Full article

   Surfaces covered with layers of ultrathin nanoantenna structures—so
   called metasurfaces have recently been proven capable of completely
   controlling phase of light. Metalenses have emerged from the advance in
   the development of metasurfaces providing a new basis for recasting
   traditional lenses into thin, planar optical components capable of
   focusing light. The lens made of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods were
   fabricated on a glass substrate by using electron beam lithography. A
   1064 nm laser was used to create a high intensity circularly polarized
   light focal spot through metalens of focal length 800 µm, N.A. = 0.6
   fabricated based on Pancharatnam-Berry phase principle. We demonstrated
   that optical rotation of birefringent nematic liquid crystal droplets
   trapped in the laser beam was possible through this metalens. The
   rotation of birefringent droplets convinced that the optical trap
   possesses strong enough angular momentum of light from radiation of
   each nanostructure acting like a local half waveplate and introducing
   an orientation-dependent phase to light. Here, we show the success in
   creating a miniaturized and robust metalens based optical tweezers
   system capable of rotating liquid crystals droplets to imitate an
   optical motor for future lab-on-a-chip applications. Full article

   The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has reported many
   cases of different UV curing inks components in foodstuffs during the
   last few years. These contaminants reach foodstuffs mainly by set-off,
   their principal migration mechanism from the package. Under this
   premise, this work has tried to characterize the process of migration
   of two common UV ink components: a photoinitiator
   (4-Methylbenzophenone) and a coinitiator (Ethyl-4-(dimethylamino)
   benzoate), from the most common plastic material used in food packaging
   low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into six different food simulants. The
   migration kinetics tests were performed at four different common
   storage temperatures, obtaining the key migration parameters for both
   molecules: the coefficients of diffusion and partition. The migration
   process was highly dependent on the storage conditions, the
   photoinitiator properties and the pH of the foodstuff. Full article

   Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in
   the food industry to modify the composition of microbiota species to
   benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and
   Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic
   diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty acids
   (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and
   polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a
   polysaccharide extract (AP) from Aloe vera, after which, these
   fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate
   the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the
   fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased
   during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence,
   the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the
   digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the
   unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total
   volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of Aloe vera
   and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics. Full article

   Aptamers are small oligonucleotides that are capable of binding
   specifically to a target, with impressive potential for analysis,
   diagnostics, and therapeutics applications. Aptamers are isolated from
   large nucleic acid combinatorial libraries using an iterative selection
   process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential
   enrichment). Since being implemented 30 years ago, the SELEX protocol
   has undergone many modifications and improvements, but it remains a
   laborious, time-consuming, and costly method, and the results are not
   always successful. Each step in the aptamer selection protocol can
   influence its results. This review discusses key technical points of
   the SELEX procedure and their influence on the outcome of aptamer
   selection. Full article

   Since 2012, more than three million Syrian refugees have fled to
   Turkey. While these refugees vary in socioeconomic background, it is
   notable that 50% of Syrian refugee children in Turkey display symptoms
   of post-traumatic stress and that more than 663,138 of these children
   between the ages of six and seventeen are not enrolled in school. For
   those children who are in school, high levels of trauma have
   significant implications for the education system as trauma alters the
   brain and affects the way children learn. A Global Voice for Autism is
   an international non-governmental relief and development organization
   that exists to equip teachers and families in conflict-affected
   communities. Its intent is to support the development and success of
   children with autism and trauma-related behavioral challenges in their
   classrooms, home, and communities. The instabilities inherent in the
   Syrian refugee experience pose a number of challenges to the
   organization’s effective implementation of programming. The experiences
   of refugees in Turkey are highly gendered. Therefore, a qualitative
   gender analysis was conducted to address and better understand the
   challenges faced when carrying out these educational interventions. The
   article examines domestic violence, sexual violence, and masculinity as
   gender-driven constructs that influence how refugees experience trauma.
   In addition, structural issues in existing support systems all present
   significant challenges to Syrian refugee parents that impede effective
   program implementation. It is imperative to assess structural issues in
   existing support services to address these challenges and to
   successfully carry out meaningful and impactful programming. This Brief
   Report provides a series of recommendations in order to ameliorate
   these challenges and increase the efficacy of educational interventions
   with Syrian refugee parents of trauma-affected and vulnerable children
   in Turkey. It concludes with a call for policy changes that protect
   refugees from deportation when accessing support services and a network
   of services that do not require residency permits. It calls for
   increased integration of parent trauma support in educational
   intervention trainings and the creation of safe spaces where mothers
   and fathers can discuss their own trauma and challenges in the hope of
   significantly enhancing program efficacy. Full article

Abstract

   :
   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.

1. Introduction

   Globally, 2.7 billion people rely on on-site sanitation with
   containment technologies, such as septic tanks and pit latrines [1]. In
   urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, 65%–100% of the population
   is served by these technologies [1,2]. On-site sanitation can provide a
   sustainable and more affordable option to sewer-based sanitation,
   either as a standalone solution or in combination [3,4]. However,
   currently, there is a lack of sustainable management of faecal sludge,
   the material that accumulates in containment technologies. If faecal
   sludge is not emptied, collected, and delivered to appropriate
   treatment, there are serious impacts to public and environmental
   health. Emptying, collection and transport services are the critical
   link in city-wide faecal sludge management, from household-level users,
   to treatment for resource recovery and safe end-use or disposal [2,5].
   Providing sanitation is a public good and the responsibility of public
   authorities. Yet, private service providers also play a key role in
   faecal sludge management. Hence, cooperative public‑private
   partnerships are essential [6]. Faecal sludge is emptied manually or
   mechanically, both with distinct advantages and disadvantages [7,8].
   Manual service providers fulfil a crucial need in densely populated,
   low-income urban settlements (“slums”) with narrow roads or paths that
   are not accessible to trucks [9]. However, manual service provision is
   often informal and unhygienic. Additionally, this faecal sludge
   typically does not get transported to treatment but directly dumped in
   the surrounding environment, as appropriate solutions are lacking
   [10,11,12]. Mechanical emptying services are provided by motorised
   trucks with vacuum pumps. This is currently the most advanced
   technology for faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport, based
   on efficiency and limited human contact with faecal matter. However,
   these services are costly. For example, in Kampala, fuel costs make up
   25% to 35% of the cost for emptying and transport [12]. A method to
   optimise logistics of city-wide emptying services could greatly reduce
   these costs.
   The use of logistical tools and information communications technology
   to analyse emptying services in low- and middle-income countries is
   limited. However, previous studies in the field of solid waste
   management have used spatial data imbedded in geographic information
   systems (GIS) for evaluating, visualising, and optimising the logistics
   of waste collection systems [13,14]. In the context of faecal sludge
   management, Kennedy-Walker et al. [15] implemented a model-based
   approach to reduce transport time of faecal sludge. Using the potential
   of available technologies and tools for analysis of transport routes
   between the location of faecal sludge emptying and discharge locations
   would allow for optimisation of many aspects of faecal sludge
   management.
   The objectives of this study were to use GPS (global positioning
   system) and GIS tools to identify the scale of operation of mechanical
   faecal sludge emptying services, and to evaluate ways to optimise
   faecal sludge logistics at a city-wide scale to increase access to
   equitable sanitation services. These innovative methodologies and tools
   for the analyses of faecal sludge management were found to be effective
   for this purpose.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Context Area

   This research was conducted in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Kampala
   has a total area of 178 km^2 at an altitude of 1140 m, and a tropical
   climate with two rainy seasons. The city is divided into five municipal
   divisions (Central, Makindye, Rubaga, Kawempe, Nakawa), which are
   further divided into 99 parishes. Of the total city area, 64% is
   classified as residential with about 1.5 million inhabitants [16]. The
   population doubles during the day, as many people commute into the city
   [17]. Approximately 60% of the city residents live in informal
   low-income settlements, which cover 10.8% of the total city area
   [18,19]. Of the Kampala residents, 92.5% are served by on-site
   sanitation (projected for 2013), with pit latrines being the most
   prevalent containment technology (36.9%), followed by septic tanks
   (27.6%), ventilated improved pit latrines (26.1%), raised pit latrines
   (5.4%), public toilets (2.8%), and other (1.2%), including open
   defecation and bucket latrines [20].
   Faecal sludge in Kampala can only be legally discharged for treatment
   at two locations, the Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant or the Lubigi
   faecal sludge and wastewater treatment plant, both operated by the
   National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). Mechanical emptying
   service providers (vacuum trucks) and formal businesses operating with
   semi-mechanised emptying technologies (e.g., the Gulper—a direct lift
   pump that can be operated by a team of 2–3 people), discharge faecal
   sludge at either of these locations. Illegal dumping by these
   businesses has not been observed. However, it is known that within the
   informal sector (manual emptying), faecal sludge is dumped directly
   into the environment, along with pit latrines that are broken open at
   the bottom and directly drain into the environment [21]. Lubigi faecal
   sludge and wastewater treatment plant started operating in 2014, and
   was already at design capacity of 400 m^3 faecal sludge per day within
   the first months. The process flow includes settling/thickening tanks,
   followed by co-treatment of the supernatant with wastewater in
   stabilisation ponds, and drying beds for the solids. Bugolobi
   wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 32,000 m^3 of
   wastewater per day, and was not designed for the additional loading of
   faecal sludge [22]. However, since there are no other options
   available, discharge of faecal sludge at Bugolobi is allowed and
   constitutes around 200 m^3 per day to the influent. Hence, Bugolobi is
   not operating as designed or meeting effluent regulations due to solids
   overloading and technical difficulties. The treatment flow at Bugolobi
   consists of settling tanks with supernatant going to trickling filters,
   solids going to digesters (if operational) followed by drying beds.
   Overall, around 59% of excreta that is managed as faecal sludge is
   safely managed, for more detailed information, please refer to
   Schoebitz et al. [23].

2.2. Research Implementation

   The data collection took place between March and July 2015. A
   literature study and field observations were carried out to obtain an
   overview of the urban sanitation system and key stakeholders. A
   stakeholder analysis was conducted to assess the organisational
   structure, mode of operation, and responsibilities of faecal sludge
   emptying services. Collaborative working relationships were established
   to ensure transparent communication of the aims and objectives of the
   study, and to obtain permission of participants. Operating trucks,
   names of drivers, truck volume, working procedures, ownership, and
   association membership were recorded.

2.3. Data Collection

   study were equipped with a GPS data logger GT-730FL-S (CanMore
   Electronics Co.; Zhubei, Taiwan). This data logger was connected to an
   XTPower MP 10400 powerbank (Model PB-AS025) (DBK Electronics Co.;
   Shenzhen, China), which served as an external battery to allow
   continuous recording for approximately 7.5 days. The data logger was
   configured to create a waypoint every ten seconds. Data loggers and
   batteries were stored in closable plastic containers, packed with paper
   to prevent moisture accumulation and to provide a buffer to external
   influences. The container was placed behind the driver’s seat and
   exchanged on a weekly basis. Battery exchange and data export were
   performed at the treatment plants during faecal sludge discharge or
   while the truck was waiting there for customers. To support this task,
   an employee of the association was appointed and remunerated.

2.4. Data Interpretation

   CanWay software (CanWay, version 1.1.12; (CanMore Electronics Co.;
   Zhubei, Taiwan, 2016) was used to export recorded waypoints from the
   data loggers and GPS data were analysed with ArcGIS (ArcGIS, version
   10.2.2; Esri: Redlands, CA, USA, 2013). For the identification of
   faecal sludge emptying events, Python scripts were developed. The
   travel velocity was calculated by dividing time and distance between
   two waypoints. Prior to implementation of the study, field testing was
   conducted to evaluate the potential for kinematic errors. Emptying
   events were simulated by stopping the truck. While stopped, errors
   showing movement of 1–3 km/h were occasionally observed. To account for
   this error, trucks were only recorded as moving if their velocity was
   greater than 4 km/h. For trucks belonging to either the Private
   Emptiers Association (PEA) or the Kampala Private Emptiers Association
   (KPEA), an emptying event was defined as a period of more than 15 min
   without movement. For trucks belonging to the Kampala Capital City
   Authority (KCCA) this period was reduced to 10 min, as it was observed
   that KCCA trucks required less time for the process of emptying the
   containment. In addition, the following events were filtered out from
   the analyses:
     * Any event between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., when the treatment plants are
       not open for discharge.
     * Any events longer than three hours, which were considered as
       waiting time.
     * Any events recorded at the treatment plant that were considered as
       discharge of faecal sludge or waiting time.

   To cross-check validity of the recorded emptying events, the total
   number was compared with obtained NWSC records from the treatment
   plants, where each discharge event is documented. In addition, factors
   that might affect the scale of emptying services were evaluated to
   determine the representativeness of the selected research period,
   including monthly precipitation (e.g., containment technologies fill up
   faster), increased income during crop harvest periods (e.g., increased
   income), and timing of school fees and public holidays (e.g.,
   decreasing emptying service requests due to extra expenditures).
   All identified emptying events that were recorded during the period of
   this research are provided as supplemental material to this paper,
   including year, month, day, and time, as well as the x- and
   y-coordinates of the event.

2.5. Data Analyses

   The following steps were performed to identify and interpret the scale
   of operation of mechanical faecal sludge emptying services:
     * GIS analyses of the spatial distribution of emptying events inside
       the boundaries of Kampala and the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
       Area, and outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area.
     * GIS analyses of service coverage in low-income informal settlements
       with KCCA statistics [24]. A 100 m buffer was added to the
       perimeter of the designated boundaries of informal settlements to
       account for their informal nature, which means they do not have
       precise boundaries and are difficult to map, show an uncontrolled
       sprawl, and experience rapid growth [25].
     * Identification of high-frequency emptying services. Locations with
       more than six recorded emptying events during the research period
       (i.e., more than two emptying events per month) where defined as
       such, indicating a non-household origin of faecal sludge.
     * Identification of areas without service provision during the study
       period. For analysis, a 0.5 × 0.5 km grid that divides the area of
       Kampala into 809 cells, each of 0.25 km^2, was projected over the
       city map. A cell was defined as an area without service provision
       if no emptying event took place during the three month research
       period. This grid was, furthermore, applied to classify these areas
       into areas with and without residents.
     * To analyse the scale of service provision on the parish level, the
       emptying frequency was calculated (Equation 1). Population and area
       are based on data obtained from Fichtner Water and Transportation
       [20].

   (1)
   Areas with no residents, and previously identified locations with
   frequent emptying events, were excluded to ensure that the analyses
   were based only on household-level emptying services. R open-source
   software (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing,
   version 3.3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
   2016) was used for analyses [26].
   To evaluate how GIS analyses could contribute to optimisation of faecal
   sludge emptying, collection and transport logistics in Kampala, a
   location-allocation analysis was performed. For this analysis, the road
   network was used to identify the shortest travel distances between the
   currently operating treatment plants and the recorded emptying events.
   Distances between the treatment plants and emptying events where then
   compared with linear distances between emptying events and future
   treatment plants in Kinawataka and Nalukolongo. These treatment plants
   are currently planned under the Kampala Sanitation Program and will
   provide two additional discharge locations for emptying service
   providers [20].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Overview of Service Providers

   In total, 63 private faecal sludge emptying, collection and transport
   trucks are operating in Kampala, of which 25 are members of the PEA, 37
   of the KPEA, and one remains independent. KCCA, the public service
   provider, had four trucks in operation during the research period.
   These primarily operated within the public sector (e.g., schools,
   markets, public, and communal toilets). Emptying services in
   institutional, industrial, and commercial areas are performed by both
   private and public service providers [12].
   Depending on the truck volume, the trucks are operated by one driver
   and one to two assistants. Faecal sludge is transported either to
   Lubigi or Bugolobi treatment plants for discharge. At the time of the
   research, the discharge fee was USD 2.0–5.6, depending on the truck
   volume. In between service calls, while trucks are waiting, they are
   based at either of the treatment plants (23 at Bugolobi, 44 at Lubigi).
   Private service providers wait at the respective treatment plant for
   customer calls, whereas KCCA operates continuously with a defined list
   of customers to be serviced daily. Manual faecal sludge emptying
   services are available, however, data on the scale of operation is
   lacking [12].
   Private service providers are directly contacted by the customer and
   the fee for emptying services ranges from USD 17–28 per trip, depending
   on factors such as distance, truck volume, presence of solid waste in
   the containment, and density of sludge [12]. The existing truck volumes
   are: 2–3.9 m^3 (23 trucks), 4–5.9 m^3 (28 trucks), 6–7.9 m^3 (3
   trucks), and 8–11 m^3 (13 trucks).
   Private service providers report that factors such as timing of heavy
   rain, monthly pay day, harvest period, due date of school fees, and
   public holidays influence the frequency of emptying requests. However,
   based on NWSC records during the period of this study, none of these
   factors showed an indicative influence. It is possible that they do
   have an effect though, as these factors mainly affect households. In
   previous studies, up to 50% of faecal sludge discharged at treatment is
   from non-household sources, and so these types of household level
   influences may not be observable [23].

3.2. Scale of Operation

   In total, 34 out of 67 trucks operating at the time were equipped with
   GPS data loggers. KCCA trucks were equipped for a five week period,
   with all other trucks were equipped for twelve weeks. During the
   research period, 5’653 emptying events were recorded. The data were
   assumed to be representative of the patterns of service delivery for
   all trucks in the city, as 51% of all trucks that were monitored
   included representative numbers from a range of factors, which could
   affect the spatial distribution of emptying events. This included 56%
   of the trucks based at Bugolobi and 48% based at Lubigi, 64% of trucks
   belonging to the PEA and 38% belonging to the KPEA, and a range of
   operating truck volumes including 56% of 2–3.9 m^3 trucks, 46% of 4–5.9
   m^3 trucks, 100% of 6–7.9 m^3 trucks, and 38% of 8–11 m^3 trucks.
   Additionally, in comparison to NWSC records of discharge events at
   treatment, this study captured 65% of emptying services provided by
   private service providers and 112% by KCCA. Private service providers
   performed an average of 2.1 emptying events per truck per day, whereas
   KCCA trucks performed 5.8 events per truck per day. Reasons for this
   significant difference appear not to be that KCCA is more efficient in
   emptying, but in scheduling emptying events, as drivers are provided
   with a daily schedule and are providing services to containment
   technologies that are readily accessible. This indicates that private
   service providers could also potentially operate at increased capacity
   with more effective planning of emptying schedules, such as proposed
   call centres [27], which could also contribute to an increase in
   overall service delivery.

3.2.1. Spatial Distribution of Emptying Events

   An overview of all recorded emptying events, of which 73% were located
   within Kampala boundaries, 22% in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
   Area, and 5% outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area is provided
   in Figure 1 (for supplemental report with additional maps available,
   see [28]). Collected faecal sludge is most frequently transported to
   the closest treatment plant to the emptying location. Due to
   urbanisation, population growth and limited unoccupied areas within
   Kampala boundaries, it can be expected that demand for faecal sludge
   emptying services outside Kampala, but within the Greater Kampala
   Metropolitan Area, will continue to increase within the near future.
   This demonstrates the importance of thinking outside of political
   boundaries when planning for faecal sludge management infrastructure
   and emptying service delivery.

3.2.2. Service Coverage in Low-Income Informal Settlements

   As illustrated in Figure 2, 37% of all recorded emptying events were
   located within informal settlements. However, when considering this
   high frequency of emptying events population density should also be
   considered, and it should not be confused with adequate access to
   improved sanitation [29], as 68% of residents of informal settlements
   in Kampala share toilet facilities with an average of 82 users [18].
   The high frequency of emptying events are, therefore, explained by an
   inadequate number of toilet facilities per capita, resulting in overuse
   and rapid filling of containment technologies. The increased population
   density in informal settlements is also a factor for increased demand
   for emptying services, which is not fully captured in these numbers as
   manual emptying is also taking place where access to trucks is not
   feasible. Service provision in these areas could potentially be
   improved by linking manual and mechanical service provision with
   transfer stations.
   Information on volumes and filling rates of containment technologies in
   Kampala is, for the most part, not available [30]. Customers frequently
   do not know volumes of their faecal sludge containment and service
   providers have to estimate based on qualitative assumptions [12]. This
   illustrates the future need for more in-depth quantification and
   characterisation studies for the appropriate planning of faecal sludge
   management and sizing of treatment facilities.

3.2.3. High-Frequency Non-Household Emptying Services

   Of the 1525 (or 37%) recorded emptying events 98 were from customers
   with high-frequency emptying services. These locations were
   non-household sources (e.g., commercial establishments, workers in
   industries, public toilets), which have faecal sludge emptied much more
   frequently than household-level users. It is imperative to consider
   non-household faecal sludge quantities, as Kampala doubles in size
   during the day with people commuting into the city [17]. It can be
   expected that faecal sludge from non-household sources has different
   physico-chemical characteristics due to shorter retention times and
   different inputs to the containment (e.g., kitchen, bathing), which
   highlights the importance of carrying out quantification and
   characterisation on a scale that is relevant to planned infrastructure
   (e.g., city-wide or neighbourhood scale). Faecal sludge is highly
   variable due to factors that range widely at the household level, such
   as soil characteristics, ground water, system inputs, quality of
   construction, type of containment, and it is also not homogenised
   during transport in the sewer as is wastewater [4]. Not taking this
   into account can lead to inappropriate designs and management plans;
   for example, using literature values instead of actual local
   characteristics led to over-design of a treatment plant by 200% over
   capacity [31]. Accurate designs are important to ensure appropriate
   treatment performance, not waste financial resources, which, among
   other factors, contribute to sustainable long-term operation of faecal
   sludge treatment plants [32].

3.2.4. Areas without Service Provision

   As presented in Figure 3, 54.7 km^2, or 31%, of the Kampala area did
   not receive any service provision during this study. To evaluate
   service provision, areas within Central Division that are connected to
   the sewer and non-residential areas were removed, resulting in a total
   adjusted area of 23.6 km^2, or 13%. Obviously, it cannot be
   extrapolated that emptying could never occur in these areas. However,
   identification of urban areas without mechanical emptying service
   provision over a three month period is valuable for a service delivery
   assessment, to identify areas for priority interventions by the
   municipality, and to identify untapped markets that the private sector
   could fill. Parts of informal settlements that were difficult to access
   could be accessed with manual emptiers using semi-mechanised equipment
   (e.g., the Gulper), and mechanical service provision elsewhere [21].

3.2.5. Influence of Population Density on Frequency of Emptying

   Hypothetically, income, type of containment technology, and population
   density could be indicators for levels of service provision. For
   example, in low-income areas, residents are less able to afford
   emptying services, and/or locations are not accessible for trucks
   [7,21]. In areas where unlined pit latrines are the prevailing type of
   containment technology, faecal sludge is typically not serviced by
   mechanical emptying with trucks due to the risk of collapse during
   emptying [20,33]. In Kampala, population density is also an indicator
   of income level and containment technology. To further evaluate service
   provision at the household level in Kampala, the frequency of emptying
   events during this study was normalised to land area and 1000
   population equivalents on a parish level (Equation (1); data for
   analyses in supplementary material, 1000 was selected for ease of
   analysis) as defined by the following four levels of service delivery:
     * Low frequency: Emptying events > 0 < 50/1000 cap × ha
     * Medium frequency: Emptying events ≥ 50 < 200/1000 cap × ha
     * High frequency: Emptying events ≥ 200 < 500/1000 cap × ha
     * Very high frequency: Emptying events ≥ 500/1000 cap × ha

   As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, adjusting emptying events for
   population density reveals that areas that have the highest levels of
   service provision were in medium- and high-income areas (Figure 6) and
   these areas also have lower resident population densities. Parishes
   with the lowest levels of service provision were in low- and very
   low-income areas and have higher resident population densities. Even
   though 37% of all emptying events inside the Kampala boundaries were
   recorded in informal settlements, 32% of those were non-household
   sources of faecal sludge that were not included in this analysis. Based
   on this analysis, it appears that household-level users in informal
   settlements are greatly underserved by toilet facilities and also
   mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers. This is not
   surprising, as the cost for emptying events (USD 17 and USD 28 per
   trip) can be as high as half of the yearly household income in
   low-income areas [12,18]. These results could indicate that a
   significant proportion of accumulated faecal sludge in low-income areas
   ends up directly in the environment, which is in line with estimates of
   up to 75% of excreta in Kampala not being safely managed in very low-
   and low-income areas of Kampala [23]. Policies and regulations need to
   be developed for equitable access to sanitation, beyond just toilet
   facilities that also includes faecal sludge management.

3.3. Optimisation of Faecal Sludge Logistics

   An analysis of spatial GIS data can also be useful for reducing travel
   times and transport costs, thereby reducing overall costs of sanitation
   provision. Route analysis and road network modelling with hypothetical
   data of faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport is possible
   in regions with well-established road networks; for example, in
   Switzerland [34]. However, this relies on basic assumptions, such as
   consistent speed limits, fuel consumption, truck volumes, containment
   volumes, and reduced idling with increased density. These assumptions
   are simply not viable in dense, urban, low-income cities in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, where fully-functional road networks do not even exist, and
   possible routing changes are not predictable.
   As road network analysis was not considered viable, analysis was
   performed with linear distance as an indication of how much travel
   distances could be reduced with additional treatment plants. Figure 7
   illustrates linear distances between emptying events and present
   location of Lubigi and Bugolobi treatment plants (a) and linear
   distances between emptying events, present location of Lubigi treatment
   plant, and future location of Kinawataka and Nalukolongo treatment
   plants (b). Figure 7a shows all emptying events in this study with
   average linear distance to existing treatment plants, compared to
   Figure 7b that includes the three treatment plants that are planned in
   the Kampala Sanitation Program [20]. The analysis reveals a reduction
   in linear distance from 6.4 km to 5.4 km. As more information on
   infrastructure, daily quantities of faecal sludge produced and
   delivered, and the possibility of transfer stations becomes available,
   this type of analyses could greatly increase the overall efficiency
   when siting treatment plants and transfer stations. For transfer
   stations to be effective in reducing transport costs, it would require
   onsite dewatering and treatment of supernatant, with dewatered sludge
   being transferred to treatment plants. In addition to reducing
   transport times, distances, and costs, it is known that there is an
   economy of scale for the level of centralisation and decentralisation
   of treatment facilities which could also be optimised, in addition to
   strategies to meet growth [35]. However, identifying locations for
   treatment plants and transfer stations is also part of a complex
   decision-making process that in addition to distances includes factors,
   such as planning restrictions, residents’ influence on decision-making,
   and the cost of land [15].
   The use of GIS tools for optimisation of faecal sludge collection and
   transport at city-wide scale provides an opportunity to increase
   sustainability of the planning and decision-making process by
   increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge
   transport times and costs. The method is applicable anywhere, but
   variables need to be adapted to the local situation; for example,
   sufficiently detailed spatial data (e.g., GIS map layers or
   crowd-sourced information). However, the analyses in this study were
   limited to mechanical emptying service providers. To increase the
   benefits for planning of city-wide sanitation service provision, and
   the potential for optimisation, the methodology could be extended to
   include logistics of manual and informal emptying, direct discharges,
   and non-emptiable types of containment.

4. Conclusions

   The benefits of employing GIS analyses as a component of planning
   include:
     * Access to sanitation: Identifying areas that lack adequate access
       to sanitation for priority intervention by local municipalities to
       increase equity of service coverage.
     * Underserved areas: Identifying areas where manual or mechanical
       private entrepreneurs could profitably increase service provision,
       and increase access to faecal sludge management.
     * Future demand: Identifying areas with rapidly growing and high
       population densities with a need for increased service provision.
     * Identify service areas: Locating areas outside of the municipal
       boundaries, which are being served by treatment plants within
       boundaries.
     * Optimise locations: Siting of treatment plants and transfer
       stations to optimise transport distances could greatly reduce
       transport costs and impacts to traffic.
     * Quantification and characterisation: Identifying sources of faecal
       sludge, which could be combined with other tools to increase
       accuracy of quantification and characterisation for appropriate
       design.
     * Existing infrastructure: Optimising usage of existing
       infrastructure.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   :
   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer.

1. Introduction

   In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown consistent
   associations between exposure to air pollution and cardio-respiratory
   morbidity and mortality [1,2,3]. The effects were partially attributed
   to traffic-related air pollutants such as fine particles, diesel soot
   or ultrafine particles in ambient air as well as other indicators of
   road traffic exposures, such as living or working close to major roads
   or nitrogen oxides [4,5,6,7]. Besides other ambient particle sources
   including e.g. industry and domestic heating, traffic emissions are
   supposed to have a significant impact on the local air quality and to
   contribute to the observed adverse health effects on humans.
   In 1999, the European Commission established limit values for PM[10]
   and some other air pollutants in the Air Quality Daughter Directive
   1999/30/EC [8], which was replaced in 2008 by the new Directive
   2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe [9]. The
   existing air quality guidelines for PM[10] are currently being exceeded
   at many locations throughout Europe and Germany [10,11,12].
   As traffic emissions are among the main contributors to anthropogenic
   pollutant emissions in the urban air [13], the reduction of traffic
   emissions offers an efficient strategy for reducing PM[10] levels in
   urban air. One widely-used, non-technical measure to meet the policy
   targets for PM[10] is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs).
   In Germany, a LEZ is a defined area (mostly located around the city
   centre) where the vehicles that enter have to meet certain emissions
   standards. For entering the LEZ all vehicles have to be identified by
   color coded windscreen badges which are directly linked to the
   corresponding stages of European emission standards (Euro 2: red; Euro
   3: yellow; Euro 4: green). Petrol-driven vehicles equipped with a
   catalytic converter are principally assigned to the Euro 4 class and
   will be entitled to a green badge. In the first stage of operation all
   vehicles with a badge (red, yellow or green) are allowed to enter the
   LEZ. In stage 2, the LEZ can be accessed by vehicles displaying a
   yellow or green badge, whereas stage 3 of the LEZ allows access only to
   vehicles with a green badge.
   The first measure aiming reduction of PM[10] concentrations in ambient
   air in Munich was the introduction of a law forbidding transit of
   vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons through the city area on 1 February
   2008. This law forces all trucks without final destination in Munich to
   use the motorway ring A99 round around the city area. As a second
   measure the first stage of the LEZ became operative at 1 October 2008.
   In this stage, all vehicles with Euro 1 (or worse) were no longer
   allowed to enter and drive within the area of the LEZ. From 1 October
   2010 the second stage of the LEZ in Munich became effective; all
   vehicles with Euro 2 (red sticker or without any sticker) are not
   allowed to enter the LEZ. Stage 3 of the Munich LEZ has been in
   operation since 1 October 2012 and only vehicles with green batches are
   allowed within the LEZ.
   Currently, LEZs have been implemented in 13 European countries [14]. In
   Germany, 49 LEZs are in operation or in the planning stages [15]. Some
   local authorities in Germany estimated the expected impact of the LEZ
   on air quality prior to their implementation (mostly by dispersion
   modeling). The predicted reduction of PM[10] mass concentration in
   ambient air, which is currently regulated and therefore the focus of
   our examination, ranges from 2% to 10 % depending on the
   characteristics of the specific LEZ, its valid stage and the number of
   exceptional permissions for cars that fail to meet the required
   emission standards. However, the verifying of the predicted reduction
   of PM[10] levels by analyzing the measured PM[10] mass concentrations
   is difficult, due to large influence of meteorological conditions on
   the PM[10] levels [16].
   Several studies about the benefit of traffic regulation measures in
   European cities were already published. PM[10] and CO levels decreased
   after the introduction of the London congestion charging scheme [17,18]
   and PM[10] and NO[X] were reduced during a seven month test period of
   the congestion tax in Stockholm. Modest reductions in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5]were observed in four Danish cities as a consequence of the
   introduction of a LEZ [19]. Since the implementation of the London LEZ
   strong reductions of the particle number concentration were detected
   [20] and small changes in the PM concentration [21]. Boogaard et al.
   [22] found that local traffic policies were associated with reductions
   in PM[2.5] in five Dutch cities. In spite of the challenges, there have
   already been a few papers analyzing the effects of the German LEZs on
   the improvement of air quality [16,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. However,
   they mostly use rather simple (and varying) statistical approaches.
   Because these studies analyze different LEZs using different
   statistical methods, the results are difficult to compare insofar as
   different statistical approaches were used for the analyses.
   In the first study of LEZ impact in Munich, the adjustment for the
   influence of meteorological conditions on PM[10] levels was conducted
   with a reference monitoring station located in a regional background
   area close to the city [25]. A relative reduction of PM[10] levels has
   been seen at almost all involved monitoring sites and the relative
   decrease ranged from 5% up to 12 %. However, this analysis was applied
   on a rather short period and used descriptive statistical analyses
   only. Morfeld et al. [30] analysed the same data set using regression
   analyses for matched observations of subsequent years and have not
   found significant effects of the LEZ.
   In our study, we extended the period under investigation and improved
   the statistical approach of the analysis. We restrict here our analysis
   only on the PM[10] particle fraction. One reason for this restriction
   is that there are no data on other relevant particle characteristics
   (such as PM[2.5], Black Smoke or particle number concentration)
   available for Munich. Secondly, LEZs were introduced in Germany as a
   primary measure for reducing PM[10] and consequently the public debate
   about the effectiveness of LEZs is mainly focused on changes in this
   particle fraction. We compared the PM[10] concentrations before and
   after the LEZ implementation by applying of a semiparametric
   statistical model with first-order autoregressive errors on data in a
   time resolution of one hour. The estimated PM[10] levels were adjusted
   for PM[10] exposure at the reference station, wind direction, season,
   time throughout a week, and public holidays. Two questions were of
   interest: First, we investigated, whether a significant overall
   reduction of PM[10] levels adjusted for possible confounders could be
   detected following the implementation of the measures in Munich and
   whether the effect at the street site differed from the urban
   background site. Second, we examined the seasonal and diurnal variation
   of the air quality changes, which might have originated in the
   variations of the number of vehicles and of the composition of the
   vehicle fleet.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Area and Selection of the Monitoring Stations

   The study was conducted in Munich, Germany. In 2011, Munich had a
   population of approximately 1.41 million inhabitants in an area of
   310.4 km^2 and there were approximately 700,000 registered cars [31].
   The LEZ in Munich covers 44 km², which accounts for 14 % of the whole
   city area. However, 32 % of the city population lives in this area
   (Figure 1).

   Ijerph 11 05094 g001
   For our study, we obtained PM[10] data collected at two monitoring
   sites located within the LEZ: one urban background site, Lothstrasse
   (measurement height: 4 m over ground) and one street site,
   Prinzregentenstrasse (measurement height: 2.9 m over ground; distance
   to road: 3 m; 39,000 vehicles/day in 2007–2010) [32,33]. The local
   traffic contributes with 22 % to the PM[10] levels at the measurement
   site Prinzregentenstrasse and to 6 % at the site Lothstrasse [33]. A
   regional background site in the outskirts of the city and outside the
   LEZ in Johanneskirchen was selected as a reference site (measurement
   height: 4 m over ground; distance to road: 5 m). All three monitoring
   stations are operated by the Bavarian Environment Agency (Bayerisches
   Landesamt für Umwelt, Augsburg, Germany) as part of the Bavarian
   Monitoring System for Air Quality (LÜB: Lufthygienisches
   Landesüberwachungssystem Bayern) (Figure 1). The remaining three
   monitoring stations were not involved in the analysis and are not shown
   in Figure 1. Two of them (Luise-Kiesselbach-Platz, Landshuter Allee)
   are located at the border of the LEZ and one (Stachus) were excluded as
   construction and tram track maintenance was conducted between August
   2008 and April 2010 in the vicinity of this monitoring site.

2.2. Study Period and Data

   In our analysis, we compared the PM[10] concentrations measured prior
   to the implementation of any air quality measures (period 1) with the
   PM[10] levels measured after the measures became effective (period 2).
   Data on PM[10] mass concentrations in an hourly time resolution were
   used for the analysis. The analysis period 1 was selected from 1
   February 2006 until 31 January 2008. In the period between 1 February
   2008 and 30 September 2008, only a truck transit ban was effective.
   This period was excluded from the analysis because it was too short to
   draw general conclusions. The examination period 2 (both transit ban
   for heavy-duty vehicles and LEZ in stage 1 were effective) covered the
   rest of the data between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2010. PM[10]
   records at the Prinzregentenstrasse were only available until 31 June
   2010, because the station was closed. The PM[10] values on 1 January
   were excluded from the analysis for each year due to the traditional
   New Year’s Eve fireworks.
   Hourly measurements of the wind direction in 36 angle categories
   representative for the city of Munich (measured ca. 4 km northwest of
   the inner city of Munich) were obtained from the German National
   Meteorological Service.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

   The urban PM[10] levels were assumed to be mainly driven by the
   following factors: The measurements at the reference station
   represented the regional background pollution level, which was mostly
   not affected by the measures. Therefore, the PM[10] levels of the
   reference station reflected the changes of the PM[10] levels of the
   station of interest owing to meteorological conditions, the background
   PM[10] levels and long term temporal trends in PM[10]. Despite large
   scale effects of the wind direction, which were represented through the
   reference station, local effects of the wind direction occur due to the
   position of the measurement stations in the local vicinity, e.g.
   regarding to nearby factories or park areas.
   Since our data comprise only four years of measurements, long term
   temporal trends at the stations within the LEZ beyond the trends at the
   reference station could not be considered in the model and are of minor
   relevance. However, seasonal variation in PM[10] concentration occurred
   (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1), which possibly may change the
   effect of the measures. Hourly PM[10] levels are subject to daily
   cyclic variation due to heating and also due to traffic; therefore, the
   measures may also affect the temporal pattern of PM[10] levels. Public
   holidays during weekdays may yield deviations from the usual
   concentration levels.
   A semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors (refer to
   Clifford et al. [34] for a Bayesian implementation of a similar model
   for ultrafine particle number concentrations) was used to estimate the
   association between air pollution and the introduction of measures:
   log(PM[10x]) = β[0] + β[1] log(PM[10ref]) + β[SM] · I[SM] + β[W] · I[W]
   + β[WM] · I[WM] + f[S](hour) · I[S] + f[SM](hour) · I[SM] + f[W](hour)
   · I[W] + f[WM](hour) · I[WM] + f[wd](wind direction) + β[2](public
   holiday) + ε .
   (1)
   The effects of the corresponding covariates were denoted with β.The
   outcome variable was the logarithmically transformed PM[10] mass
   concentration at an urban station, which is denoted by log(PM[10][x]).
   I[S], I[W,] I[SM], I[WM] denote the indicator function for “summer
   without measures”, “winter without measures”, “summer with measures”
   and ”winter with measures”, respectively. The winter season was defined
   from October to March, the summer season from April to September.
   The following variables were considered as confounding factors:
   logarithmically transformed PM[10] levels at the reference station
   (log(PM[10][ref])), a smooth, cyclic effect based on P-splines with
   maximum four degrees of freedom of the wind direction, f[wd](wind
   direction), and an indicator for public holidays (public holiday).
   Adjusting for the PM[10] measurements at the reference station prevents
   from “regression to the mean” [35], improves the power of the model in
   comparison to the analysis of differences [36] and allows flexible and
   simple adjustments for other confounders. We selected the confounder
   variables by a priori considerations. Since we include an adjustment by
   the reference station with similar temperature and precipitation, we
   did not use these variables in the confounder model. Since wind
   direction has a local effect, which differs from the effect at the
   reference station, we included the variable wind direction in our
   model.
   In addition, the model was adjusted for deterministic seasonal
   components, similar to [37]. The effect of the measures (M) was
   analyzed separately for summer (S) and winter (W) to allow for seasonal
   variability. Daily and daytime-specific deviations were modeled with an
   hourly-resolved weekly season-specific trend, f[S](hour) · I[S],
   f[SM](hour) · I[SM], f[W](hour) · I[W], f[WM](hour) · I[WM] Cyclic
   penalized splines were used as basis functions for a smooth
   nonparametric estimation. Permitting a maximum number of 49 degrees of
   freedom, the model reached enough flexibility to describe the daytime
   dependent variability of the traffic.
   Percentage changes of PM[10] levels were modeled through logarithmic
   concentration levels [37]. In particular, it was suggested that the
   measures, the public holidays and the seasons yielded to percentage
   effects on the PM[10] concentration.
   Note, that the usage of the semiparametric model lessens the problem of
   scale. Furthermore, the highly skewed distribution of the PM[10] mass
   concentration was another reason for using the logarithmic
   transformation.
   Since the measurements are not independent, an autoregressive process
   of order 1 is simultaneously modeled for the error term ε.
   The overall effect of the measures was examined for each of the two
   seasons with a test on the hypotheses whether the effect coefficients
   for winter and summer differ between the periods with and without
   measures:
   H[0] : β[W] = β[WM],β[SM] = 0
   (2)
   Day-specific effects were investigated using an appropriate linear
   combination of the effect coefficients, representing the area between
   the smooth effect with and without measures. The inference for the
   day-specific effects was based on the asymptotic normality of linear
   combinations (for more details see Supplemental Material, “Modelling of
   day specific effects”).
   Statistical calculations were conducted using R [38], version 2.15.3;
   semiparametric models were estimated with the package “mgcv” [39],
   version 1.7-22.

3. Results

3.1. Data Description

   Figure 2 shows the weekly means of PM[10] concentrations at the two
   monitoring sites within the LEZ (Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse)
   and at the reference site in Johanneskirchen. Weekly means were chosen
   to display the trend of PM[10] levels for reasons of clarity and
   reducing the point-to-point variation.

   The PM[10] concentrations were higher in the winter season and lower in
   the summer season. In particular, elevated PM[10] levels were observed
   between January and March. The means of the unadjusted PM[10] mass
   concentrations before and after the implementation of measures are
   given in Table 1.
   At both urban stations, a decrease of PM[10] in period 2 (compared to
   period 1) was observed. The decrease at Prinzregentenstrasse (−14.0% in
   summer, −1.9% in winter) was larger in summer and similar in winter as
   at Lothstrasse (−2.3% in summer, −2.5% in winter). At the reference
   station in Johanneskirchen, also differences between the two periods
   were detected (−2.1% in summer, −0.8% in winter). The PM[10]
   concentration was on average 27.6% at Prinzregentenstrasse and 12.5% at
   Lothstrasse higher (median percentage difference) than at the reference
   station. While considering mere mean concentrations the impact of
   confounding factors like meteorological conditions were disregarded;
   the regression analysis in section 3.2 allowed for these confounders.
   The Spearman correlation coefficients between the hourly means of
   PM[10]concentration measured at the three monitoring sites were high
   and ranged from 0.69 to 0.88, the correlations between the daily
   averages were even slightly stronger (ranged from 0.83 to 0.96). The
   hourly PM[10] concentrations at the three monitoring sites were highly
   autocorrelated with autocorrelation coefficients between 0.87 and 0.92.
   The temporal trend of the annual means observed at the urban background
   site Lothstrasse and the regional background site (as the reference
   site) in Johanneskirchen was very similar. It indicates that both sites
   were not influenced by any local sources of PM. Even more, the PM[10]
   values obtained at the measurement site in Johanneskirchen were very
   similar and strong correlated with the PM[10] values observed at a
   regional background site located at the campus of the Bavarian Agency
   for Environmental Protection in Augsburg, Germany (about 90 km linear
   distance from Johanneskirchen).

3.2. Statistical Modeling

   According to equation (1), the PM[10] concentrations at a specific
   monitoring site were calculated for “summer without measures” and
   “winter without measures” as well as “summer with measures” and “winter
   with measures”, respectively. In Table 2, the relative differences
   between the periods with and without measures are shown for
   Prinzregentenstrasse (street site) and Lothstrasse (urban background
   site), and indicated separately for the summer and winter season.

   Note: adjusted for exposure at the reference station, wind direction,
   day of the week, time of the day and public holidays.
   The effects of the air quality measures differ at the two measurement
   stations as well as between the seasons. A stronger reduction in PM[10]
   mass concentrations was observed at the street site; on average 19.6%
   (5.4 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.001) in summer and 6.8% (2.1 µg/m^3, p-value:
   <0.001) in winter, respectively. At the urban background site
   Lothstrasse smaller decreases were estimated: 5.73% (1.1 µg/m^3,
   p-value: <0.001) in summer and 3.18% (0.7 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.003) in
   winter. If we had not have determined separate effects for the two
   seasons, the reduction of the PM[10] concentration by the measures at
   Prinzregentenstrasse would have been estimated with 13.0% (p-value:
   <0.001) and with 4.5%; (p-value: <0.001) at Lothstrasse.
   Figure 3 shows the temporal patterns of the modeled PM[10]
   concentrations at Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse for the periods
   with and without measures (adjusted for PM[10] concentration at the
   reference station, wind direction and public holidays). Temporal
   variability of PM[10] levels occurred between the seasons, the weekdays
   and times of day. The concentrations were higher in the winter months.
   The morning and afternoon rush hour peaks during the working days were
   clearly visible especially at Prinzregentenstrasse. The morning peak in
   the summer months was more clearly separated from the afternoon peak as
   in the winter season. The efficiency of the measures depended on the
   time of the day (see also Supplemental Material, Figure S2) and
   followed a diurnal pattern. Due to the implemented measures the PM[10]
   burden was stronger reduced during hours with higher relative and
   absolute PM[10] mass concentration, i.e. between the morning and
   afternoon rush hour peaks. The rush hour peaks themselves were reduced
   and there seemed to be lesser spillover from the morning to the
   afternoon. Furthermore, the improving of air quality during the nights
   on workdays was faster at the street site. The effect of the measures
   vanishes during night-time of the first days of the working week.
   The mean daily effects of both measures (stratified by season and week
   day) are shown in Figure 4 for each day of the week separately. In the
   summer season, the effect of the measures for each day of the week was
   at the street site stronger than in winter, whereas this tendency is
   not observed at the background site. However, at both sites the
   strongest effects were observed on Fridays (−25.0% in summer and −16.4%
   in winter at street site, −8.2% in summer and −6.1% in winter at the
   background site) and Saturdays (−25.9% in summer at street site, −11.4%
   in summer and −5.3% in winter at the background site). On Sunday a
   strong seasonal dependency of the effect was observed: the measures
   were only effective in summer.
   The effects of the linearly modeled confounding covariates are
   displayed in Supplemental Material, Table S1. The logarithmic values of
   the reference station had a significant, additive effect of log(1.381)
   = 0.323 at Prinzregentenstrasse and log(1.972) = 0.679 at Lothstrasse.
   Public holidays led to a reduction of PM[10] levels in the ambient air
   by approximately 13%. Since the estimated autocorrelation coefficient
   was relatively high (Prinzregentenstrasse: ρ = 0.70, Lothstrasse: ρ =
   0.54), the bigger part of the autocorrelation of the PM[10]
   measurements could not be explained through the inclusion of the smooth
   components in the predictor. The model for the measurements at
   Prinzregentenstrasse explained 74.5% of the variability in the data and
   the model for the Lothstrasse 83.0%.
   The shape of the smooth effect of wind direction indicates decreased
   PM[10] levels, if the wind blew from the South or West at Lothstrasse
   and if the wind blew from North or East at Prinzregentenstrasse (data
   not shown). We focused our analysis on PM[10], because the reason for
   the establishment of the LEZ exceeded PM[10] limit values.

4. Discussion

4.1. Impact of the Measures on PM[10] Mass Concentration

   We investigated whether changes in PM[10] levels after the introduction
   of a truck transit ban through the city area and the implementation of
   the first stage of the LEZ in Munich could be detected by analysis of
   emission data on PM[10] mass concentration collected at an urban
   background and a street monitoring site. The comparison of the PM[10]
   mass concentrations (adjusted for exposure at the reference station,
   wind direction, day of the week, time of the day and public holidays
   and calculated separately for summer and winter seasons in a
   semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors) showed a
   large relative decrease of PM[10] levels at the street site (13.0%,
   p-value: <0.001), whereas the relative decrease observed at the urban
   background monitoring site was smaller (4.5%, p-value: <0.001). The
   decrease of PM[10] mass concentration predicted in Munich by dispersion
   modeling ranges between 2% and 10 % depending on the monitoring sites
   and the active stage of the LEZ [40]. The maximal reduction (up to 10
   %) was predicted only for the third stage of the LEZ. The changes of
   PM[10] concentrations detected at the street site in our study are
   larger than the reductions predicted a priori and are also larger than
   those observed in the most other German cities [16,23,24,26,27,28,29].
   In general, the implementation of LEZ could influence the composition
   of the car fleet as well as the traffic intensity. The percentage of
   registered vehicles without any badge (Euro 1 or less) decreased during
   the time period 2007–2010 from 9.2% to 2.5% for passenger cars and from
   31.5% to 24.1% for trucks, respectively. In the same time the
   percentage of vehicles with green badge increased from 78.4% to 89.6%
   for passenger cars and from 19.0% to 36.1% for trucks, respectively.
   Those changes are especially pronounced between the years 2007 and
   2008, it means immediately before the implementation of the LEZ in
   Munich [41]. Such an extraordinary modernization of vehicle fleet in
   the city towards low-emission cars was reported also for Berlin [28].
   Note that there is only information about the in Munich registered
   vehicles; no such information is available about the car fleet
   composition in flowing traffic in the city. Regarding the flowing
   traffic it can be assumed that the older vehicles are less often in use
   compared to the newer vehicles.
   For the dispersion modelling, it was assumed that the traffic intensity
   remained constant over the time period 2007–2010. However, the analyses
   presented here are not only considering the impact of the LEZ alone,
   but also the additional impact of the transit ban for all trucks. The
   transit ban for trucks could affect the PM[10] levels even to a larger
   extent than the LEZ, which operated in the analyzed period in the first
   stage only. It leads not solely to a reduction of particles emitted by
   vehicle exhaust, but also to a reduction of particles originated from
   tyre and brake wear or dust re-suspension. Due to the ban on driving
   for trucks on Sunday, the effect for Sunday can be directly ascribed to
   the implementation of the LEZ. A similar pattern was found for
   Saturday, but only at Prinzregentenstrasse. This lead us to the
   assumption that in winter, the vehicle fleet on weekends in the city
   and on Sundays in the urban background was the same before and after
   the introduction of the LEZ, whereas this was not the case during the
   summer season.
   In the previous study estimating the LEZ impact in Munich, a slightly
   weaker effect of 12.3% relative reduction of PM[10] mass concentration
   at Prinzregentenstrasse was found [25]. The analysis was based on the
   comparison of relative PM[10] concentration changes by a reference
   station. However, such analysis of the quotient between the specific
   monitoring station and the reference station neglects the uncertainty
   of the measurements at the reference station. Further regression
   analyses on the ratio as used in the previous study revealed a
   comparably poor model fit (data not shown). This is also denoted by the
   strong deviation of the estimation of the intercept from 1 in our
   analysis. For comparison, we also analyzed the same period as described
   in Cyrys et al. [25] by use of the model applied in our study. We only
   found negligible (statistically insignificant) changes of the PM[10]
   mass concentration (Prinzregenstrasse −1.05%, p-value: 0.855;
   Lothstrasse: 2.42%, p-value: 0.499), as it was similarly found by
   Morfeld et al. [30]. For further comparisons of the approach used in
   our study with other modelling approaches we refer to the “comparison
   of different modeling approaches” section in the Supplemental Material.
   The results of our study are not directly comparable to the results
   obtained for other measures of traffic reduction, which were already
   introduced in some European cities. We analyzed here the common effect
   of the implementation of LEZ and transit ban for trucks in Munich and
   we are aware that such combination is not that common. Even if we might
   be able to evaluate the effects of the LEZ and transit ban for trucks
   separately, the comparison with other cites might remain difficult, as
   the regulations and areas of LEZ’s differ from city to city. The
   following discussion should compare rather roughly the range of the
   effects observed for different measures across Europe. Several studies
   analyzed the impact of congestion charging in London [17,18,42].
   Atkinson et al. [17] observed reductions in PM[10] only at the
   background monitor. The study conducted by Beevers and Carslaw [18]
   indicated that NO[x] and PM[10] emissions have been reduced by about
   12% in the charging zone, whereas the study of Tonne et al. [42] showed
   that the congestion charge schema led to only modest reductions in air
   pollutant concentrations across Greater London, but greater reductions
   in the charging zone. Ellison et al. [21] found that the LEZ in London
   had a significant effect on the composition of the vehicle fleet in
   London and reduced the PM[10] concentrations.
   Johansson and colleagues [43] assessed the effect of traffic congestion
   in Stockholm and concluded that the annual average NO[x] and PM[10]
   concentrations along the most densely trafficked streets would be lower
   by up to 12% and 7%, respectively. Note that the effects in the studies
   of Beevers and Carslaw [18], Tonne et al. [42] and Johansson et al.
   [43] were analyzed by dispersion modelling combined with regression
   calculation and were not verified by air quality measurements. PM[2.5]
   concentrations in Copenhagen were reduced by 5% after the introduction
   of the LEZ [19]. Unadjusted mean pollutants concentrations were lower
   after the implementation of the LEZ in five Dutch cities; the reduction
   in PM[2.5] levels was larger at urban streets (31%) than in the
   suburban background (20%) [22].
   The public debate is often focused solely on PM[10] concentrations (as
   this parameter is currently regulated) without taking into account that
   only the toxic fraction of PM[10] causes adverse human health effects
   [2,3,16]. Due to combustion processes particles originating from
   traffic exhibit a higher toxicity than particles from other sources;
   especially diesel-engine vehicles, which produce about 12% of the mean
   PM[10] exposure of the German population [44], emit these more toxic
   particles.
   Hence, the effectiveness of LEZ could be analyzed more precisely if
   Black Smoke (as marker for diesel soot) or the organic fraction of
   particles would be measured in ambient air instead of total PM[10]
   concentration [16]. Unfortunately, in Germany no routine measurements
   of Black Smoke concentrations in ambient air are conducted. Quadir and
   colleagues [45] reported recently significant lower concentrations for
   elemental carbon and some of particulate organic compounds after the
   introduction of the LEZ in Munich (the data were collected during
   special monitoring campaigns and not routinely by the monitoring
   network). Source apportionment analysis showed a reduction of traffic
   factor contribution by 60% after the implementation of the LEZ [45].
   Also in Berlin the concentration of soot particles decreased 2010 by
   52% compared with 2007 [29]. As climatic conditions in the years
   2008–2010 were adverse when compared to 2007, the authors attribute
   these results to the reduced traffic soot emissions. Currently, a
   debate about the pollution through PM[2.5] emerges, but the data
   material is insufficient because the monitoring of PM[2.5] is only at
   its early stages.
   In addition to dispersion modelling, estimating the expected changes of
   PM[10] mass concentration in the ambient air, our analysis evaluates
   the effects of the measures by analysis of the measured PM[10] values.
   However, the limitation of this strategy is, that also long-term
   changes of PM[10], which could not be explained by the included
   predictors, especially by the PM[10] levels of the reference station
   (for example changes in heating habits), are completely attributed to
   the LEZ effect.

4.2. Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of the Changes in PM[10] Levels

   The second objective of this study was the examination of the seasonal
   and diurnal variation of the detected air quality improvements. The
   extent of the PM[10] reduction at the background sites was largely
   similar in both seasons. In the urban background, exhaust particles
   represent a smaller fraction of fine particles compared to street site
   and the composition of particles varies less between winter and summer.
   On the contrary the difference between the two seasons was more
   pronounced at the street site, where the overall reduction of PM[10]
   mass concentrations was considerable larger as at the background site.
   At this site, the reduction of PM[10] levels due to the measures was
   larger during the summer season and smaller during the winter season.
   In winter, additional particle sources (such as domestic heating, wood
   combustion or combustion of other fossil fuels) contribute
   significantly to the PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air.
   Also the contribution of re-suspended dust to fine particles
   concentration in the ambient air increases in winter due to the
   application of road salt for deicing. In addition, the generation of
   secondary aerosols such as nitrate or sulfate is more intensive in
   winter. Consequently, exhaust particles represent a smaller fraction of
   the fine particles in winter than in summer. Therefore, the measures
   regulating only the exhaust particles became less effective in the
   winter period. In addition, adverse meteorological conditions leading
   to increased PM[10] levels from local mobile as well as stationary
   sources are occurring more frequently in the winter season. Our
   analysis suggests that in such episodes the influence of the
   implemented measures regulating the car exhaust is limited and that air
   quality is dominated by other unaffected mobile and stationary sources.
   The reduced rush hour peaks may indicate that a larger proportion of
   old cars no longer accessed the city during midday. Alternatively, the
   contribution of aged particles from the morning rush hours during day
   and night time might be shifted due to the reduction in diesel
   particles. Further, the temporal varying effect of the measures could
   be caused by the same reason as the differences between winter and
   summer season. One has to keep in mind that the morning and afternoon
   rush hour peaks seem to be more separated in summer not due to
   differences in traffic flow between summer and winter, but as a result
   of the combination of increased traffic intensity and increased solar
   radiation in summer.

5. Conclusions

   In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of two measures (a truck
   transit ban through the city area and implementation of LEZ) on the
   reduction of PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air in Munich,
   Germany. The analysis of the routinely collected PM[10] mass
   concentrations data by a semiparametric regression model showed
   statistically significant reduction of PM[10] levels at a monitoring
   site located in the direct vicinity of a highly frequented road and to
   a lesser extent at an monitoring site located in the urban background.
   The statistical regression modeling was essential to identify the size
   of the effect. The magnitude of the effect at the street site was
   larger in summer season; smaller seasonal variation was observed at the
   urban background site. In general, the magnitude of the effect depends
   on day of the week, time of the day and location of the monitoring
   site.
   Our analysis indicates that the assessment of the impact of measures
   aiming improvement of air quality in urban air could be conducted by
   use of routinely collected PM[10] data. However, as the expected
   reduction of PM[10] concentration after implementation of LEZ is in
   order of about 10%, the evaluation of this measure by PM[10] data
   remains difficult; other particulate variables, such as PM[2.5], Black
   Smoke, or particulate organic compounds are recommended for such
   evaluation.

Abstract

   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs. View Full-Text

   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve
   the surveillance of adverse events following the
   measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) tetravalent vaccine that was
   provided in the official immunization schedule of some Italian regions
   for children during the second year of life. This recommendation was
   based on data from some surveys that showed an additional risk of
   seizure following the administration of this vaccine. Responding to the
   Ministry commitment, the Puglia Region launched, from May 2017 to
   November 2018, a post-marketing active surveillance program of adverse
   events following MMRV immunization (AEFIs). Immunized children (second
   year of life) were enrolled on a voluntary basis, AEFIs diaries were
   used, and their parents were interviewed 25 days after the
   immunization. There were 2540 children enrolled; 2149/2540 (84.6%)
   completed the post-vaccination follow-up. Of these, 992 AEFIs were
   registered with a reporting rate of 46.2 × 100 doses: 883/992 (89.0%)
   AEFIs were not serious, while 109/992 (11.0%) were serious. For serious
   AEFIs, the evaluation of causality assessment was performed using the
   algorithm proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO): 82/109
   consistent causal associations to MMRV immunization were detected
   (reporting rate of consistent AEFIs: 3.8 × 100 follow-up). All serious
   AEFIs consistently associated with immunization resulted completely
   resolved at the follow-up. The reporting rate of seizure consistently
   associated with immunization was 0.05 × 100, lower than data previous
   published in the literature that did not report the causality
   assessment. Because no emerging signals were detected, our data from
   the active surveillance program confirmed the safety profile of the
   MMRV vaccine. Full article

   The activation of halogen bonding by the substitution of the
   pentafluoro-λ^6-sulfanyl (SF[5]) group was studied using a series of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes. The simulated electrostatic potential
   values of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes, the ab initio molecular
   orbital calculations of intermolecular interactions of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes with pyridine, and the ^13C-NMR
   titration experiments of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes in the presence
   of pyridine or tetra (n-butyl) ammonium chloride (TBAC) indicated the
   obvious activation of halogen bonding, although this was highly
   dependent on the position of SF[5]-substitution on the benzene ring. It
   was found that 3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene was the most effective halogen
   bond donor, followed by o-SF[5]-substituted iodobenzene, while the m-
   and p-SF[5] substitutions did not activate the halogen bonding of
   iodobenzenes. The similar ortho-effect was also confirmed by studies
   using a series of nitro (NO[2])-substituted iodobenzenes. These
   observations are in good agreement with the corresponding Mulliken
   charge of iodine. The 2:1 halogen bonding complex of
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) was
   also confirmed. Since SF[5]-containing compounds have emerged as
   promising novel pharmaceutical and agrochemical candidates, the
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene unit may be an attractive fragment of
   rational drug design capable of halogen bonding with biomolecules. Full

   Background and Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT)
   are characterized by cell damage caused by inflammatory and metabolic
   mechanisms induced by alteration in reduction-oxidative status. Serum
   advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are new markers of protein
   damage induced by oxidative stress. We evaluated serum levels of AOPP
   in a cohort of patients with DM and HT, with or without renal
   complications, compared with a control healthy population. Materials
   and Methods: The study group comprised of 62 patients with type 2 DM
   and 56 with HT. The 62 patients affected by DM were further
   distinguished in 24 subjects without renal impairment, 18 with diabetic
   nephropathy (DN), 20 with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2–3
   secondary to DN. The subgroup of 56 patients with primary HT comprised
   26 subjects without renal complications and 30 with CKD (stage 2–3)
   secondary to HT. Thirty healthy controls, matched for age and sex, were
   recruited among blood donors. Results: Increased AOPP levels were found
   in DM patients compared with healthy subjects, although not
   significantly. This index was higher and more significant in patients
   with DN and CKD secondary to DN than in DM patients without nephropathy
   (p < 0.05) or controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with HT and with kidney
   impairment secondary to HT also had significantly higher AOPP serum
   levels than controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There
   were no significant differences in mean AOPP levels among DM and HT
   patients. Conclusion: Our study showed that oxidative stress was higher
   in diabetic or hypertensive subjects than in healthy controls and, in
   particular, it appeared to be more severe in patients with renal
   complications. We suggest that the assessment of AOPP in diabetic and
   hypertensive patients may be important to predict the onset of renal
   failure and to open a new perspective on the adoption of antioxidant
   molecules to prevent CKD in those settings. Full article

   Helicobacter pylori infection is a WHO class 1 carcinogenic factor of
   gastric adenocarcinoma. In the past decades, many studies have
   demonstrated the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance and pointed
   out the necessity of new effective treatment. This study was aimed at
   identifying phytochemicals that can inhibit H. pylori and possibly
   serve as adjuvant treatments. Here, in silico molecular docking and
   drug-like properties analyses were performed to identify potential
   inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and aspartate-semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase. These three enzymes are targets of the treatment of H.
   pylori. Susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed on the
   selected phytochemicals and the positive control antibiotic,
   amoxicillin. The in-silico study revealed that oroxindin, rosmarinic
   acid and verbascoside are inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and
   aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, in which, oroxindin
   has the highest potency against H. pylori, indicated by a minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 50 μg/mL. A combination of
   oroxindin and amoxicillin demonstrated additive effects against H.
   pylori, as indicated by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)
   value of 0.75. This study identified phytochemicals that deserve
   further investigation for the development of adjuvant therapeutic
   agents to current antibiotics against H. pylori. Full article

   Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary approach
   to cancer therapy that requires accumulation of boron atoms
   preferentially in tumour cells. This can be achieved by using
   nanoparticles as boron carriers and taking advantage of the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Here, we present the
   preparation and characterization of size and shape-tuned gold NPs
   (AuNPs) stabilised with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized
   with the boron-rich anion cobalt bis(dicarbollide), commonly known as
   COSAN. The resulting NPs were radiolabelled with ^124I both at the core
   and the shell, and were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of human
   fibrosarcoma (HT1080 cells) using positron emission tomography (PET).
   Methods: The thiolated COSAN derivatives for subsequent attachment to
   the gold surface were synthesized by reaction of COSAN with
   tetrahydropyran (THP) followed by ring opening using potassium
   thioacetate (KSAc). Iodination on one of the boron atoms of the cluster
   was also carried out to enable subsequent radiolabelling of the boron
   cage. AuNPs grafted with mPEG-SH (5 Kda) and thiolated COSAN were
   prepared by ligand displacement. Radiolabelling was carried out both at
   the shell (isotopic exchange) and at the core (anionic absorption) of
   the NPs using ^124I to enable PET imaging. Results: Stable gold
   nanoparticles simultaneously functionalised with PEG and COSAN
   ([email protected][4]^−) with hydrodynamic diameter of 37.8 ± 0.5 nm,
   core diameter of 19.2 ± 1.4 nm and ξ-potential of −18.0 ± 0.7 mV were
   obtained. The presence of the COSAN on the surface of the NPs was
   confirmed by Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
   [email protected][4]^− could be efficiently labelled with ^124I both at
   the core and the shell. Biodistribution studies in a xenograft mouse
   model of human fibrosarcoma showed major accumulation in liver, lungs
   and spleen, and poor accumulation in the tumour. The dual labelling
   approach confirmed the in vivo stability of the [email protected][4]^−.
   Conclusions: PEG stabilized, COSAN-functionalised AuNPs could be
   synthesized, radiolabelled and evaluated in vivo using PET. The low
   tumour accumulation in the animal model assayed points to the need of
   tuning the size and geometry of the gold core for future studies. Full

   The efficacy of radiosurgery for neurofibromatosis type 2
   (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) remains debatable. We
   retrospectively analyzed radiosurgical outcomes for NF2-associated VS
   compared to sporadic VS using our database of 422 consecutive VS
   patients. Twenty-five patients with 30 NF2-associated VSs with a mean
   follow-up of 121 months were identified. NF2-associated VSs exhibited
   excellent tumor control (10-year cumulative rate, 92% vs. 92% in
   sporadic VSs; p = 0.945) and worse overall survival (73% vs. 97%; p =
   0.005), mainly due to tumor progression other than the treated VSs. The
   presence of NF2 was not associated with failed tumor control via
   multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses. No difference in
   radiation-induced adverse events (RAEs) was confirmed between cohorts,
   and prescription dose (hazard ratio 8.30, 95% confidence interval
   3.19–21.62, p < 0.001) was confirmed as a risk for cranial nerve
   injuries via multivariate analysis. Further analysis after propensity
   score matching using age, volume, and sex as covariates showed that
   NF2-associated VSs exhibited excellent local control (100% vs. 93%; p =
   0.240) and worse overall survival (67% vs. 100%; p = 0.002) with no
   significant difference in RAEs. Excellent long-term tumor control and
   minimal invasiveness may make radiosurgery a favorable therapeutic
   option for NF2 patients with small to medium VS, preferably with
   non-functional hearing or deafness in combination with postoperative
   tumor growth or progressive non-operated tumors, or with functional
   hearing by patients’ wish. Full article

   Celecoxib (CEL) Nanocrystalline Solid Dispersion (CEL_NCSD) was
   generated by spray drying CEL, mannitol (MAN) and sodium lauryl sulfate
   (SLS) from a solvent mixture of methanol, acetone and water. The
   purpose of the work was to determine the size of CEL nanocrystals,
   investigate agglomeration and inspect dissolution of CEL_NCSD. Size
   determination was challenging as CEL nanocrystals are embedded in the
   matrix of MAN. Firstly, neat CEL_NCSD was analyzed using Scherrer
   equation. Secondly, MAN was dissolved in an aqueous stabilizer medium
   to selectively measure the size of CEL nanocrystals. Raman Spectra
   captured in Morphologi G3-ID confirmed the presence of CEL-only
   particles in the media. This dispersion gave D[90] values of 882 ±
   170.34 nm in Zetasizer. Discriminatory dissolution studies confirmed
   total release of 34.61 ± 1.59%, 47.42 ± 0.24%, and 44.61 ± 1.11% at 120
   min from a microsuspension (size 3 µm), a nanosuspension (media milled;
   size 660 nm) and CEL_NCSD, respectively. The dissolution profile of
   CEL_NCSD was similar to that of a nanosuspension (f2 72.24) instead of
   a coarse microsuspension. Thus, the present study revealed that
   optimized sample preparation is critical for the size determination of
   embedded drug nanocrystals in NCSD. Further, a discriminatory
   dissolution study substantiated that the size of CEL nanocrystals in
   CEL_NCSD is well below 1000 nm, thus showing a size-dependent improved
   dissolution profile. Full article

   The detection of shedded fibers in effluents from textile washing has
   attracted much attention due to its reported contribution to
   microplastic pollution. Commonly used analytical methods for fiber
   detection in liquids are based on filtration with subsequent
   microscopic analysis and/or gravimetric weighing. These approaches are
   time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an approach based on
   dynamic image analysis was applied in order to set up an efficient
   method to analyze fibers in effluents from washing processes. In an
   initial validation step, reliable information on the counts of fibers
   and the morphological characteristics were confirmed. For wastewaters
   from polyester-cotton blends, the chemical nature of the fiber debris
   (natural vs. synthetic origin) was determined by combining the dynamic
   image analysis with a chemical pre-treatment. In this study, dynamic
   image analysis was revealed as a rapid, non-destructive, precise, and
   reliable technology for the characterization and quantification of the
   fiber debris, offering a promising approach for fiber analysis in
   liquids. Full article

   In recent years, liver injury induced by Traditional Chinese Medicines
   (TCMs) has gained increasing attention worldwide. Assessing the
   hepatotoxicity of compounds in TCMs is essential and inevitable for
   both doctors and regulatory agencies. However, there has been no
   effective method to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs
   available until now. In the present study, we initially built a large
   scale dataset of drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs). Then, 13 types of
   molecular fingerprints/descriptors and eight machine learning
   algorithms were utilized to develop single classifiers for DILI, which
   resulted in 5416 single classifiers. Next, the NaiveBayes algorithm was
   adopted to integrate the best single classifier of each machine
   learning algorithm, by which we attempted to build a combined
   classifier. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
   curve of the combined classifier were 72.798, 0.732, 0.724, and 0.793,
   respectively. Compared to several prior studies, the combined
   classifier provided better performance both in cross validation and
   external validation. In our prior study, we developed a
   herb-hepatotoxic ingredient network and a herb-induced liver injury
   (HILI) dataset based on pre-clinical evidence published in the
   scientific literature. Herein, by combining that and the combined
   classifier developed in this work, we proposed the first instance of a
   computational toxicology to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs.
   Then Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PmT) was used as a case to
   investigate the reliability of the approach proposed. Consequently, a
   total of 25 ingredients in PmT were identified as hepatotoxicants. The
   results were highly consistent with records in the literature,
   indicating that our computational toxicology approach is reliable and
   effective for the screening of hepatotoxic ingredients in Pmt. The
   combined classifier developed in this work can be used to assess the
   hepatotoxic risk of both natural compounds and synthetic drugs. The
   computational toxicology approach presented in this work will assist
   with screening the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs, which will further
   lay the foundation for exploring the hepatotoxic mechanisms of TCMs. In
   addition, the method proposed in this work can be applied to research
   focused on other adverse effects of TCMs/synthetic drugs. Full article

   Diet plays a decisive role in heart physiology, with lipids having
   especial importance in pathology prevention and development. This study
   aimed to investigate how dietary lipids varying in lipid profile
   (virgin olive oil, sunflower oil or fish oil) affected the heart of
   rats during aging. Heart histopathology, mitochondrial morphometry, and
   oxidative status were assessed. Typical histopathological features
   associated with aging, such as valvular lesions, endomyocardical
   hyperplasia, or papillary muscle calcification, were found at a low
   extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was
   that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to
   the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level, heart mitochondrial
   area, perimeter, and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than
   in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers,
   there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity,
   lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil.
   In summary, dietary intake for a long period on dietary fats with
   different fatty acids profile led to differences in some aspects
   associated with the aging process at the heart. Fish oil seems to be
   the fat most protective of heart during aging. Full article

   Surfaces covered with layers of ultrathin nanoantenna structures—so
   called metasurfaces have recently been proven capable of completely
   controlling phase of light. Metalenses have emerged from the advance in
   the development of metasurfaces providing a new basis for recasting
   traditional lenses into thin, planar optical components capable of
   focusing light. The lens made of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods were
   fabricated on a glass substrate by using electron beam lithography. A
   1064 nm laser was used to create a high intensity circularly polarized
   light focal spot through metalens of focal length 800 µm, N.A. = 0.6
   fabricated based on Pancharatnam-Berry phase principle. We demonstrated
   that optical rotation of birefringent nematic liquid crystal droplets
   trapped in the laser beam was possible through this metalens. The
   rotation of birefringent droplets convinced that the optical trap
   possesses strong enough angular momentum of light from radiation of
   each nanostructure acting like a local half waveplate and introducing
   an orientation-dependent phase to light. Here, we show the success in
   creating a miniaturized and robust metalens based optical tweezers
   system capable of rotating liquid crystals droplets to imitate an
   optical motor for future lab-on-a-chip applications. Full article

   The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has reported many
   cases of different UV curing inks components in foodstuffs during the
   last few years. These contaminants reach foodstuffs mainly by set-off,
   their principal migration mechanism from the package. Under this
   premise, this work has tried to characterize the process of migration
   of two common UV ink components: a photoinitiator
   (4-Methylbenzophenone) and a coinitiator (Ethyl-4-(dimethylamino)
   benzoate), from the most common plastic material used in food packaging
   low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into six different food simulants. The
   migration kinetics tests were performed at four different common
   storage temperatures, obtaining the key migration parameters for both
   molecules: the coefficients of diffusion and partition. The migration
   process was highly dependent on the storage conditions, the
   photoinitiator properties and the pH of the foodstuff. Full article

   Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in
   the food industry to modify the composition of microbiota species to
   benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and
   Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic
   diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty acids
   (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and
   polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a
   polysaccharide extract (AP) from Aloe vera, after which, these
   fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate
   the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the
   fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased
   during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence,
   the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the
   digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the
   unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total
   volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of Aloe vera
   and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics. Full article

   Aptamers are small oligonucleotides that are capable of binding
   specifically to a target, with impressive potential for analysis,
   diagnostics, and therapeutics applications. Aptamers are isolated from
   large nucleic acid combinatorial libraries using an iterative selection
   process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential
   enrichment). Since being implemented 30 years ago, the SELEX protocol
   has undergone many modifications and improvements, but it remains a
   laborious, time-consuming, and costly method, and the results are not
   always successful. Each step in the aptamer selection protocol can
   influence its results. This review discusses key technical points of
   the SELEX procedure and their influence on the outcome of aptamer
   selection. Full article

   Gender-Related Challenges in Educational Interventions with Syrian

   Since 2012, more than three million Syrian refugees have fled to
   Turkey. While these refugees vary in socioeconomic background, it is
   notable that 50% of Syrian refugee children in Turkey display symptoms
   of post-traumatic stress and that more than 663,138 of these children
   between the ages of six and seventeen are not enrolled in school. For
   those children who are in school, high levels of trauma have
   significant implications for the education system as trauma alters the
   brain and affects the way children learn. A Global Voice for Autism is
   an international non-governmental relief and development organization
   that exists to equip teachers and families in conflict-affected
   communities. Its intent is to support the development and success of
   children with autism and trauma-related behavioral challenges in their
   classrooms, home, and communities. The instabilities inherent in the
   Syrian refugee experience pose a number of challenges to the
   organization’s effective implementation of programming. The experiences
   of refugees in Turkey are highly gendered. Therefore, a qualitative
   gender analysis was conducted to address and better understand the
   challenges faced when carrying out these educational interventions. The
   article examines domestic violence, sexual violence, and masculinity as
   gender-driven constructs that influence how refugees experience trauma.
   In addition, structural issues in existing support systems all present
   significant challenges to Syrian refugee parents that impede effective
   program implementation. It is imperative to assess structural issues in
   existing support services to address these challenges and to
   successfully carry out meaningful and impactful programming. This Brief
   Report provides a series of recommendations in order to ameliorate
   these challenges and increase the efficacy of educational interventions
   with Syrian refugee parents of trauma-affected and vulnerable children
   in Turkey. It concludes with a call for policy changes that protect
   refugees from deportation when accessing support services and a network
   of services that do not require residency permits. It calls for
   increased integration of parent trauma support in educational
   intervention trainings and the creation of safe spaces where mothers
   and fathers can discuss their own trauma and challenges in the hope of
   significantly enhancing program efficacy. Full article

   Health of Refugee, Immigrant and Displaced Children)

Abstract

   :
   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results.

1. Introduction

   Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools capable of suggesting
   items to users according to their preferences [1]. A popular
   recommendation technique, called Collaborative Filtering (CF), consists
   of learning users’ preferences by only relying on their interactions
   with the items available in a catalog. For example, using a
   nearest-neighbor search (memory-based CF) or a machine learning model
   (model-based CF), it is possible to select the most relevant items for
   each user who has interacted enough with the system [2]. An alternative
   approach to this problem is represented by content-based RSs, which can
   generate suggestions by matching users’ profiles with the features of
   the items [3,4]. Another family of recommendation methods proposed in
   the literature is represented by hybrid algorithms, capable of
   combining both collaborative and content-based filtering for mitigating
   the individual weaknesses of the previous techniques [5].
   While these recommendation approaches usually guarantee interesting
   results in traditional domains, such as movie recommendation, they are
   not capable of capturing the temporal evolution of users’
   preferences [6]. For example, different authors [7,8,9] argue that
   movies watched recently provide more useful information about a certain
   user than those she consumed in a distant past. It is, in fact,
   reasonable to assume that a recent item may have a high influence on
   the choice of the next one.
   Therefore, a RS that exploits sequential data for predicting the sole
   next item that will be consumed by a user can be defined as sequential
   recommender [10]. Several works related to sequential recommenders are
   available in the literature. For example, Zhou et al. [11] exploited a
   sequential pattern mining algorithm for recommending which page to
   visit next in a website, while Rendle et al. [8] relied on Markov
   chains for suggesting products considering previous purchases.
   Recently, He et al. [9] designed a recommender system capable of
   modeling how users’ interests evolve over time. While all these methods
   usually consider user preferences observed during the training phase as
   sequences, no temporal ordering is available at recommendation time, as
   only one item, or a list of items ranked by relevance, is suggested to
   users. Because of the popularity of CF techniques, most of sequential
   recommenders are based on such approaches [12], but in principle it is
   also possible to design systems capable of analyzing sequences
   according to content-based methods.
   In general, even if the problem of creating a sequence of words
   starting from an initial one is a well-known task inside the natural
   language processing community [13], the idea of creating personalized
   sequences of items is less widespread in the context of RSs [14]. For
   this reason, it would be interesting to be able to exploit the temporal
   ordering not only during the training phase but also for generating
   sequences of recommended items, such as in the task of language
   modeling. Some solutions to this problem have already been proposed in
   industry, and also few researchers have discussed how to automatically
   construct music playlists [15] or suggest sequences of
   points-of-interest to tourists [16] starting from seed items.
   However, early studies conducted in this field lack of a common
   definition of the problem that they are trying to address. For example,
   session-based RSs only consider the last session of the current
   user [17], while sequence-aware recommenders also exploit the history
   of past sessions [12] and they can be considered equivalent to
   sequential recommenders. Furthermore, it is not clear if item
   repetitions are allowed in the suggestions or not.
   In this work, we argue that it is possible to consider RSs capable of
   creating personalized sequences of an arbitrary length as a
   generalization of a sequential recommender because the latter is only
   able of creating sequences of length one. In contrast to traditional
   RSs that usually create lists of items ranked by relevance, in the
   following we will define a recommender that exploits a temporal
   dimension both in the training and in the generation phase as a
   sequence-based recommender, as it observes and suggests sequences of
   items meant be consumed in a particular order.
   On the other side, several evaluation protocols and metrics for
   analyzing novel RSs via offline experiments are available, to capture
   the different aspects of the recommendation algorithm [18]. However,
   the lack of a standardized way of performing such in vitro experiments
   leads to results that are often incomparable [19]. To the best of our
   knowledge, no evaluation framework for sequence-based RSs has already
   been proposed. The motivating hypothesis of this study is that in the
   context of sequence-based RSs, traditional evaluation metrics need to
   be computed at the level of sequences instead of the level of users.
   In our view, an evaluation framework consists of a methodology for
   performing an experimental comparison, a set of metrics, and a software
   tool that implements them. Therefore, the main aim of this work is to
   address the following research questions and to introduce an offline
   evaluation framework for sequence-based RSs that we called Sequeval.

   RQ1
          What is the formal definition of a sequence-based recommender
          system?

   RQ2
          How already established metrics can be extended and adapted for
          evaluating a sequence-based recommender system?

   RQ3
          Against which baselines a sequence-based recommender system can
          be compared?

   Because our evaluation approach is agnostic with respect to the
   implementation details of the algorithms under analysis, it can be
   successfully exploited to also assess the performance of systems based
   on alternative recommendation methods [20] or dealing with
   unconventional categories of items, for example 3D movies [21] or
   cultural digital contents [22], especially if they are supposed to be
   consumed by users in a sequential order.
   Besides, by openly releasing a Python implementation of Sequeval, we
   aim to encourage the use of the proposed framework as an attempt to
   standardize the evaluation of sequence-based RSs, mitigating the
   comparability problem in RSs research.
   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we
   review related works; in Section 3 we present the mathematical
   definition of a sequence-based recommender system; in Section 4 we
   introduce Sequeval by describing its evaluation protocol, metrics, and
   implementation details; in Section 5 we perform an empirical analysis
   of the framework with two different datasets. Finally, in Section 6, we
   formulate our conclusions and we outline future works.

2. Related Work

   In this section, we distinguish among works related to RSs capable of
   exploiting sequences of items (Section 2.1), evaluation protocols and
   metrics for performing an offline comparison (Section 2.2), and their
   experimental reproducibility (Section 2.3).

2.1. Sequential Recommenders

   Several examples of sequential recommenders are available in the
   literature [12]. Zhou et al. [11] proposed a web recommender system
   based on a sequential pattern mining algorithm. The recommender is
   trained with the access logs of a website and its goal is to predict
   the pages that are likely to be visited by a certain user, given her
   previously visited pages. The authors proposed to store the model in a
   tree-like structure, relying on a technique originally designed for
   matching substrings over a finite alphabet of characters. A
   recommendation is then created by matching the sequence of pages
   already visited by the target user with the sequences previously
   analyzed by the algorithm.
   In the context of market basket analysis, it is also possible to
   exploit the sequence of previous transactions to predict what a
   customer is going to buy next [23]. Rendle et al. [8] proposed a method
   based on personalized transition graphs over Markov chains, while Wang
   et al. [10] designed a recommender capable of modeling both the
   sequential information from previous purchases and the overall
   preferences by a hybrid representation.
   Bellogín and Sánchez [24] proposed a similarity metric designed to
   compare users in the context of CF RSs. This metric takes into account
   the temporal sequence of users’ ratings to identify common behaviors.
   The authors argue that it is possible to consider a sequence of items
   as a string, where each character represents an item, and compare them
   using the longest common subsequence algorithm [25].
   Recently, He et al. [9] introduced the concept of translation-based
   recommendation. While a traditional RS only considers the pairwise
   interactions between items and users, their idea is to model a
   third-order relationship among a user, the items she interacted with in
   the past, and the item she is going to visit next. Each user can be
   represented as a vector in a transition space: given the current item,
   it is possible to compute where the next one will be located. At
   recommendation time, it is possible to generate a list of suggested
   items by relying on a nearest-neighbor search.
   On the other hand, the task of generating recommendations of sequences
   was already discussed and presented in a seminal work by Herlocker et
   al. [14]. The authors suggested that it would be intriguing to be able
   to suggest, in the music domain, not only the songs that will be
   probably liked by a certain user, but also a playlist of songs that is
   globally pleasing. Moreover, they also proposed to apply this
   recommendation methodology in the context of scientific literature,
   where it is necessary to read a sequence of articles to become familiar
   with a certain topic of interest.
   The former problem was later addressed by Chen et al. [15], who
   designed and implemented a recommender system capable of generating
   personalized playlists by modeling them as Markov chains. Their
   algorithm is capable of learning, from a set of training playlists, how
   to represent each song as a point in a latent space. Then, starting
   from a seed song, it is possible to create a playlist of an arbitrary
   length by repeatedly sampling the transition probabilities between
   adjacent songs. The resulting playlist is personalized because of the
   chosen seed. Furthermore, each user can influence the generation
   process by specifying some parameters: for example, a user might be
   more interested in popular songs, while another one in songs that are
   strictly related to the given seed.
   Another typical application for a sequence-based recommender is the
   next point-of-interest (POI) prediction problem [12]. Given some
   training sequences of previously liked geographical locations, this
   task consists of predicting a sequence of venues that is pleasing for a
   given user. Feng et al. [16] proposed an algorithm capable of creating
   sequences of POIs that have not been already visited. The authors
   developed a Metric Embedding algorithm that captures both the
   sequential information and individual preference. Such metric is then
   exploited to create a Markov chain model capable of representing the
   transition probabilities between a given POI and the next one. The key
   features that are implicitly considered in the embedding creation phase
   are the conceptual similarity and the geographical distance of the
   analyzed venues.
   A different line of research is represented by recommenders capable of
   analyzing sequences of multimedia objects. For example, Albanese et
   al. [26] proposed a hybrid recommender system for retrieving multimedia
   content based on the theory of social choice and capable of exploiting,
   among other signals, the implicit browsing preferences of its users.
   Later, the authors of [27] introduced a multimedia recommendation
   algorithm capable of combining semantic descriptors and usage patterns.
   The proposed approach can manage different media types and it enables
   users to explore several multimedia channels at the same time. Possible
   applications of such technologies are represented by browsing tools for
   virtual museums [28] and recommenders of cultural heritage sites [29].
   Differently from the previously reported works, our main aim is not to
   propose a novel recommendation algorithm, but a general method to
   standardize how the sequences of recommended items are generated and
   evaluated in an offline setting.

2.2. Offline Evaluation

   To the best of our knowledge, the first survey that deals with the
   problem of evaluating a recommender system was conducted by Herlocker
   et al. [14]. In their work, the authors discuss when it is appropriate
   to perform an offline evaluation and when it is necessary to carry on
   an online, or in vivo, experiment. The former is particularly useful to
   select a small set of potentially good candidates that will be further
   compared in a real scenario. However, to be complete and trustworthy,
   such a evaluation needs to rely on a set of well-defined metrics, that
   should be able to capture all characteristics of the recommended items.
   They review several accuracy metrics usually exploited by different
   authors and they classify them into three categories: predictive
   accuracy metrics, classification accuracy metrics, and rank accuracy
   metrics. These groups are strictly related to the purpose of the
   recommender system: predicting a rating for each user-item pair,
   identifying an item as appropriate or not for a user, and creating an
   ordered list of recommended items for a user. Furthermore, the authors
   suggest that it is necessary to avoid relying only on accuracy to draw
   a reliable conclusion: for this reason, they also review and discuss
   the metrics of coverage, learning rate, novelty, serendipity, and
   confidence.
   Gunawardana and Shani [18] proposed a set of general guidelines for
   designing experiments with the purpose of evaluating RSs. Such
   experiments can be classified as offline trails, user studies, or
   online analysis that involve a live system. Several properties of a
   recommender system can be evaluated: for example, the most common ones
   are user preference, prediction accuracy, coverage, and utility. The
   authors argue that the possibility of measuring these properties is
   strongly influenced by the kind of study and, in the most extreme
   scenario, some of them cannot be obtained. For example, it is very
   difficult to measure users’ preference in an offline setting.
   For each property, different commonly exploited metrics are presented
   and discussed. Even if the main metrics proposed for evaluating the
   most popular properties are widely known and understood, usually there
   is little agreement about the most appropriate metrics for
   characterizing the least common properties. For example, several
   definitions, and several metrics, related to the property of utility
   are available in the literature. The authors also point out that a key
   decision of offline experiment design is the splitting protocol because
   this choice will greatly influence the final outcome of the measures.

2.3. Experimental Reproducibility

   Different authors analyzed the experimental reproducibility of offline
   evaluations. For example, Jannach et al. [19] compared several
   recommendation algorithms in an offline experiment, analyzing their
   performance by relying on a comprehensive evaluation framework. The
   authors considered different splitting protocols and metrics, designed
   to characterize both the accuracy, in terms of rating and ranking, and
   the coverage of the suggested items. The results of the experimental
   trails suggest that some common algorithms, despite their high
   accuracy, tend to only recommend popular items that are probably not
   very interesting for the users of a real system. This problem is
   related to the popularity biases introduced by the offline evaluation
   protocol: for this reason, it is not advisable to compare different
   algorithms by relying only on measures related to their accuracy. In
   addition, different splitting protocols produce significantly different
   and non-comparable outcomes.
   Bellogín et al. [30] proposed an evaluation framework designed
   following the methodologies of the Information Retrieval (IR) field.
   They suggest that the evaluation procedures available in IR are
   widespread: for this reason, they could be successfully exploited by
   the RS community to create a shared evaluation protocol based on
   ranking, as this setting is more similar to the one of a live system.
   Unfortunately, three different decisions need to be taken to achieve
   this goal.
   The items considered for the evaluation could be all items available in
   the dataset, or only the items available in the test set. The
   non-relevant items for a certain user could be represented by all items
   in the test set not rated by that user, or by a subset of it with a
   fixed size. Finally, the global metric could be computed by averaging
   its value on all users, or on all ratings available in the test set.
   Different design choices will result in different evaluation protocols
   and results. The authors also identify two sources of biases in offline
   evaluations protocols: the sparsity bias and the popularity bias.
   Several software tools are available with the purpose of simplifying
   the process of comparing the performance of recommendation algorithms.
   They typically include some evaluation protocols and a reference
   implementation of well-known techniques. Said and Bellogín [31]
   compared several of these tools to check if their results are
   consistent. They discovered that the values obtained with the same
   dataset and algorithm may vary significantly among different
   frameworks. For this reason, it is not feasible to directly compare the
   scores reported by these tools, because they are obtained relying on
   several protocols. The discrepancies reported by the authors are mainly
   caused by the data splitting protocol, the strategy used to generate
   the candidate items, and the implementation choices related to the
   evaluation metrics.

3. Sequence-Based Recommender Systems

   Before analyzing the evaluation framework, we introduce the problem of
   recommending sequences and we provide an answer to RQ1. In a
   traditional recommender system, users express positive or negative
   preferences about a certain item. An item may be, for example, a
   product, a song, or a place. In contrast, we assume that when a user
   consumes or interacts with an item, she expresses an implicit rating
   about it. This assumption in the literature goes under the name of
   implicit feedback [14]. Because we are also considering the temporal
   dimension to build the sequences, each rating is associated with a
   timestamp that represents the point in time when it was recorded.

   expressed a positive preference at the timestamp
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>τ</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">T</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   By relying on the set of ratings
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   available in the system, it is possible to construct the sequences that
   will be used to train and to evaluate the recommender. Each sequence
   only includes the ratings expressed by a single user. On the other
   hand, each user may produce several sequences.
   The concept of sequence is similar to the concept of session in a
   traditional web interaction: if two ratings are distant in time more
   than an interval
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , then they belong to different sequences. Some ratings may be isolated
   and, for this reason, not part of any sequence. The most appropriate
   value for
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   depends on the domain: for example, in the POI recommendation scenario,
   it could be considered of a few hours as reported in [16].

   A sequence-based recommender is an RS capable of suggesting a
   personalized sequence that is built starting from a seed rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>0</mn>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , considering the example sequences already available in the system and
   the specific behavior of a certain user. The seed rating is
   characterized by a seed item
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mn>0</mn> </msub> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , a target user
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>υ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and an initial timestamp
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>τ</mi> <mn>0</mn> </msub> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   . The seed item can be represented by any item that belongs to the
   catalog, but, more in general, it is a point in the space of items
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For example, in the music domain, it could identify not only a
   particular song, but also an artist, a genre, or a mood. The target
   user is the user to whom the sequence is recommended, while the initial
   timestamp represents the point in time in which the recommendation is
   created. The generated sequence is of a fixed length and it contains
   exactly k ratings. Please note that if
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>k</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]

   Thus, a sequence-based recommender system typically works by learning
   from a set of sequences

   the conditional probability of the next rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>k</mi>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   to the sequence of previous ones
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi

   <mo>−</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , i.e., the factors of the right-hand side of Equation (2). Sampling
   sequences directly from Equation (2) would require computing the
   probabilities of all the
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi>I</mi> <mo>|</mo>
   </mrow> <mi>k</mi> </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   possible sequences, where
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi>I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   is the size of the vocabulary of items and k is the length of the
   sequences. Since this becomes easily computationally unfeasible, we opt
   for a greedy approach, in which at each step we sample the next most
   likely item. A sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is defined to select a particular next rating from the previous ones at
   each step:
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> <mi>k</mi> </msub>

   </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   (4)
   A trivial example of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>a</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>g</mi> <mi>m</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>x</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   function, which simply selects the most probable next rating. In the
   following, we will assume that
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is implemented by a weighted random sampling function.
   Algorithm 2 formalizes the procedure for generating a personalized
   sequence, given a seed rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>0</mn>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and a length k, i.e., it describes the sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>σ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For k times, the next rating of the recommended sequence is generated
   using the function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>d</mi>
   <mi>i</mi> <mi>c</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>d</mi>
   <mi>i</mi> <mi>c</mi> <mi>t</mi> <mo>:</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>→</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   implements the sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   and it returns the most probable next rating for the current input
   sequence. In practice, the sequence-based recommender system can
   estimate the probability that the next rating of the current sequence
   will include a particular item at a certain timestamp.
   Please note that the greedy procedure described in Algorithm 2 is not
   the only way to create samples of sequences, and thus, the user of the
   evaluation framework or the designer of the recommendation method are
   free to define other ways and strategies for that end.

   To compute some metrics that are part of the evaluation framework, it
   is necessary to know the number of items that are associated with a
   certain sequence. For this reason, we define the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the set of items that are part of the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the set of ratings that are part of the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Therefore,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub>
   <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   is the number of distinct items available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , while
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">R</mi> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub>
   <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   represents the length of

   , i.e., the number of ratings available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   For instance, we can suppose that the set of ratings

   is equal to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>{</mo> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <msub>

4. Sequeval

   Comparing the performance of several recommenders with an experiment
   that involves a live system is not always feasible or appropriate. For
   this reason, it is necessary to first perform a preliminary evaluation
   in an offline scenario [18]. In such a setting, we can assess the
   performance of the algorithms by comparing with baselines,
   understanding the strengths and weaknesses of those, and thus avoiding
   affecting real users negatively in their experience with the system.
   The results of an offline experiment will be less trustworthy than the
   ones obtained from an online study because there was no real
   interaction with the system [32], but they are usually exploited as the
   first stage in the preparation of the in vivo experimentation.
   Even if an offline study is only the first step in the process of
   evaluating a recommender, it is necessary to rely on a solid evaluation
   protocol and a set of well-defined metrics that are able to capture all
   the characteristics of the analyzed algorithm [33]. In the following,
   we will introduce an offline evaluation framework for sequence-based
   RSs that we called Sequeval.
   Our framework is based on the concept of sequence as formalized in
   Section 3. First, an initial dataset is transformed into a set of
   sequences following Algorithm 1. Then, the sequences are split between
   training and test sets. At this point, one or more external
   recommenders are plugged into the framework: they are exposed to the
   training sequences and they are asked to create suggested sequences
   starting from the same seeds of the test ones. A possible strategy for
   suggesting additional sequences is described in Algorithm 2, but the
   user can define other approaches. Finally, considering the
   recommendations available, the framework can compute different
   evaluation metrics.
   In details, Sequeval is made of an evaluation protocol, presented in
   Section 4.1, a set of evaluation metrics, described in Section 4.2, and
   a software implementation that is introduced in Section 4.3.

4.1. Evaluation Protocol

   One of the first problems that an evaluation framework should consider
   is how to split the dataset between the training set and the test set.
   This task is not trivial, as it will deeply influence the outcome of
   the experimentation [31]. Since we are dealing with sequences, we need
   to split the set of sequences
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   in a training and test set such that
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>=</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>g</mi>
   </mrow> </msub> <mo>∪</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi>
   <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   Several solutions to this problem are possible: a simple but effective
   one is to perform the splitting by randomly assigning sequences to
   these sets according to a certain ratio, typically the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>80</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for training and the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>20</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for testing. If the number of sequences available is limited, it is
   necessary to perform a cross-validation. Another possibility is to
   identify an appropriate point in time and to consider all the sequences
   created before it as part of the training set, and after it as part of
   the test set. This protocol simulates the behavior of a recommender
   introduced at that point in time and it avoids too optimistic results
   caused by the knowledge of future events [34]. The latter solution can
   be considered the most reliable one, but if we do not have any temporal
   information because the sequences have already been created, it is
   necessary to adopt a random protocol.
   More in general, it is impossible to identify a splitting method that
   is appropriate for every experiment, as it depends on the domain and on
   the dataset available. For this reason, Sequeval does not impose the
   adoption of a particular splitting protocol, but the experimenter can
   choose the most appropriate one.
   To compute the metrics that are part of the evaluation framework, the
   sequence-based recommender is trained with all the sequences
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>g</mi>
   </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Then, for each test sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi>
   <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> <mo>:</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mo>…</mo>
   <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>n</mi> </msub>
   <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , we predict a recommended sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   of length k using
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mi>υ</mi> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi>τ</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   as seed rating, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mo>=</mo> <mi>sequence</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo>
   <mi>k</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Therefore,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   is a sequence suggested by the recommender, for the same user and
   starting from the same item of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . We also define
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the reference sequence, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>′</mo> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>3</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mo>…</mo>
   <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>n</mi> </msub>
   <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   or
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>′</mo> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>−</mo>
   <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn>
   </msub> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The reference sequence is equal to the original sequence, but the
   first rating is omitted, as it was already exploited for creating the
   recommended sequence. This procedure is graphically illustrated in
   Figure 1.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

   The second component of Sequeval is a set of eight metrics that we
   present in the following. In order to address RQ2, we include in such
   set not only classic metrics such as coverage and precision but also
   less widespread ones such as novelty, diversity, and serendipity.
   Furthermore, we introduce the metric of perplexity, as it is explicitly
   designed for characterizing sequences [35]. In contrast, we decided to
   avoid measuring recall because it is clear that the number of
   recommended items is often likely to be much lower than the total
   number of relevant items.

4.2.1. Coverage

   In general, the coverage of a recommender is a measure that captures
   the number of items in the catalog over which the system can make
   suggestions [18]. For example, in an online store scenario, it could
   represent the percentage of products that are recommended to users in a
   certain period of time. An algorithm with a higher coverage is
   generally considered more useful because it better helps users to
   explore the catalog.
   We generate a set of recommended sequences considering as seed the
   first rating of all sequences in the test set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow>
   <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   for a recommender that suggests sequences of length k. Afterward, we
   compute the distinct number of items available in the sequences created
   and we divide the result by the cardinality of the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>coverage</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>
   <mi>k</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <mrow> <mrow>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mo>⋃</mo> <mrow> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi>
   <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </msub> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mrow> <mi>sequence</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub>
   <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mi>k</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </msub> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> <mrow>
   <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mfrac>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   (5)
   This metric expresses the percentage of items that the sequence-based
   recommender can suggest when generating sequences similar to the ones
   available in the test set and it is strictly related to its
   cardinality. This approach is similar to the metric of prediction
   coverage described by Herlocker et al. [14].

4.2.2. Precision

   Precision is a widespread metric in the context of IR evaluation [36]
   and it represents the fraction of retrieved documents that are
   relevant. For a traditional recommender system, precision measures the
   fraction of recommended items that are relevant for a certain
   user [37]. If we consider a sequence-based recommender, it is necessary
   to compute this metric for each sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi>
   <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , instead of each user.
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>precision</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>
   <mi>k</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mrow>

   (6)
   The function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>h</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>t</mi> <mo>:</mo>
   <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>×</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>→</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   returns the number of items in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   that are also available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   . If the same item is present in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   multiple times, it is considered a hit only if it is repeated also in
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   . This is an extension to the traditional definition of precision that
   also considers the fact that an item may appear multiple times inside a
   sequence.
   The number of relevant items is divided by the minimum number between
   the length of the reference sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">R</mi> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>′</mo> </msup> </msub> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   and the length of the recommended sequence k. We decided to adopt this
   solution to avoid penalizing an algorithm that is evaluated considering
   reference sequences shorter than the recommended sequences.

4.2.3. nDPM

   The Normalized Distance-based Performance Metric (nDPM) was originally
   proposed by Yao in the context of information retrieval [38]. The
   intuition of the author is that in order to compare a system ranking
   with a reference user ranking, it is necessary to consider all the
   possible pairs of items available in the system ranking: they can be
   agreeing, contradictory, or compatible with respect to the user
   ranking. We decided to adopt such a metric instead of the Normalized
   Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) [39] because, in a sequence of
   recommendations, it is not necessarily true that the first items are
   more important than the last ones.

   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>

   for which the ordering is irrelevant, i.e., when at least one of the
   items is not available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   or when at least one of the items is available multiple times in
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Finally, the function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>s</mi> <mo>:</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>→</mo> <mi

   returns the number of all possible pairs available in the recommended
   sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The pairs are created without considering the ordering of the items
   inside a pair: for example, if we have the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <mi>a</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>b</mi>
   <mo>,</mo> <mi>c</mi> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , the possible pairs are
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>a</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>b</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> <mo>,</mo> <mo>(</mo> <mi>a</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>c</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> <mo>,</mo> <mo>(</mo> <mi>b</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>c</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   The value of this metric will result close to 1 when the sequences
   generated by the recommender are contradictory, to 0 when they have the
   same ranking, and to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   when the ordering is irrelevant because they contain different items. A
   low precision will imply a nDPM very close to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.2.4. Diversity

   The metric of sequence diversity included in this framework is inspired
   by the metric of Intra-List Similarity proposed by Ziegler et al. [40].
   The recommended sequences are considered to be lists of items and the
   obtained value is not related to their internal ordering. The purpose
   of this metric is understanding if the sequences contain items that are
   sufficiently diverse. A higher diversity may be beneficial for the
   users, as they are encouraged to better explore the catalog [41].

   is a generic similarity measure between two items. This measure may be

   <mo>]</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   : higher values represent a higher diversity.

4.2.5. Novelty

   Vargas et al. [42] suggested that it would be useful to be able to
   characterize the novelty of the recommendations. They proposed a metric
   that rewards algorithms capable of identifying items that have a low
   probability of being already known by a specific user because they
   belong to the long-tail of the catalog. We have included such metric in
   our framework to assess whether the items available in the suggested
   sequences are not too obvious.

   . We can define the probability of observing the item
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ι</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the number of ratings related to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ι</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   in the training sequences divided by the total number of ratings
   available. We also assume that

   </msub> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>≐</mo>
   <mn>0</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   by definition, to avoid considering as novel items for which we do not
   have any information, i.e., the items that do not appear in the
   training sequences.

4.2.6. Serendipity

   Serendipity can be defined as the capability of identifying items that
   are both attractive and unexpected [43]. Ge et al. proposed to measure
   the serendipity of a recommender by relying on the precision of the
   generated lists after having discarded the items that are too
   obvious [33].
   To create a list of obvious items, it is possible to exploit a
   primitive recommender that is a recommender only capable of making
   obvious suggestions. For example, a primitive recommender could be
   implemented using the Most Popular (MP) baseline, which is defined in
   Section 4.3. It is reasonable to assume that popular items do not
   contribute to the serendipity of the recommendations because they are
   already well known by many users.
   By modifying the metric of precision described in Section 4.2.2, it is
   possible to introduce the concept of serendipity in the evaluation of a
   sequence-based recommender. In this case, the primitive recommender
   will always create a sequence of length k that contains the items that
   are have been observed with the highest frequency in the training set.

   , i.e.,

   . Moreover, the sequence

   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> </mrow> </semantics>

   contains all the ratings related to the items available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   that are not present in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover accent="true"> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>^</mo> </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The resulting value will be a number in the interval
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>[</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>1</mn>
   <mo>]</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , lower than or equal to precision. The difference between precision
   and serendipity represents the percentage of obvious items that are
   correctly suggested.

4.2.7. Confidence

   The metric of confidence reflects how much the system trusts its own
   suggestions and it is useful for understanding how robust the learned
   model is [44]. It is usually computed as the average probability that
   the suggested items are correct. This metric expresses the point of
   view of the recommender, as the probability is reported by the model.
   Therefore, the metric is always equal to 1 with the MP recommender, as
   it is certain of the predictions.
   A sequence-based recommender generates the next item of the sequence by
   considering all the previous items. For this reason, we can interpret
   the conditional probability of obtaining a certain item, given the
   sequence of previous ones, as the confidence that the system has in
   that suggestion.
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>confidence</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>

   We also define

   <mn>0</mn> </msub> <mo>≐</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , i.e., the zero-th item of the recommended sequence is its seed item.
   Therefore, this metric is computed by also considering the probability
   of obtaining the first item
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mover> <mi>ι</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , given the seed item of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.2.8. Perplexity

   Perplexity is a widespread metric in the context of neural language
   modeling evaluation [35], typically used to measure the quality of the
   generated phrases. Because there is a strong similarity between
   creating a sequence of natural language words and sequence of
   recommended items given an initial seed, perplexity can be also
   successfully exploited in this context.
   This metric can be defined as the exponential in base 2 of the average
   negative log-likelihood of the model, i.e., the cross-entropy of the
   model. For models based on the cross-entropy loss function such as
   neural networks, the perplexity can also be seen as a measure of
   convergence of the learning algorithm. Differently from the metric of
   confidence, the conditional probability
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
   <mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> <mo>|</mo>

   is computed considering the items of the test sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and not of the recommended sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For this reason, it does not express the point of view of the
   recommender.

   Intuitively, the obtained value represents the number of items from
   which an equivalent random recommender should choose to obtain a
   similar sequence. The lower is the perplexity, the better is the system
   under evaluation. Therefore, the perplexity of a random recommender is
   equal to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . If the performance of the recommender is worse than a random one, the
   perplexity will be higher than
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   : for example, if only one conditional probability is equal to zero,
   then
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>perplexity</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mo>+</mo>
   <mo>∞</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.3. Implementation

   The third component of Sequeval is sequeval [45], a Python
   implementation of the evaluation framework which is publicly available
   on GitHub (https://github.com/D2KLab/sequeval). This implementation is
   based on the protocol presented in Section 4.1 and it includes the
   metrics described in Section 4.2.
   In details, sequeval is a Python package designed following a modular
   structure. For each component, we defined an abstract class and then we
   realized one or more possible implementations to enable software
   extensibility. For example, we have implemented an input module capable
   of processing a textual file in a MovieLens-like format (UIRT), but the
   support to other dataset formats can be easily added. The module
   representing the recommender system under analysis includes an abstract
   class that is based on the sequence generation logic formalized in
   Algorithm 2.
   To exploit the proposed framework, it is necessary to realize an
   implementation of the abstract recommender that must be capable, given
   the user and the current item of the sequence, of predicting the
   probabilities for the possible items of being the next one inside the
   recommended sequence. If the weighted random sampling generation logic
   is not appropriate, it is possible to override the relative method and
   to define an alternative recommendation approach.
   For obtaining the experimental results, it is necessary to write an
   evaluation script that relies on this library. We provide a simple
   evaluation script which can be used to perform different experiments.
   This script can be easily modified to accommodate novel recommendation
   techniques.
   We also created an extensive test suite achieving the 98% of code
   coverage for validating the robustness of our implementation and for
   better supporting future improvements. The total development cost of
   this Python library could be estimated around 40 h.
   For demonstrative purposes, we have implemented four baseline
   recommenders, which are illustrated in the following and represent our
   answer to RQ3. These baselines can be interpreted as an adaptation of
   classic non-personalized recommendation techniques to our
   sequence-based scenario.
     * Most Popular The MP recommender analyzes the sequences available in
       the training set to compute the popularity of each item, i.e., the
       number of times an item appears in the training sequences. Then, at
       recommendation time, it ignores the seed rating, and it always
       creates a sequence that contains the MP item as the first rating,
       the second MP item as the second rating, and so on. More formally,
       the probability that the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       will appear in the i-th rating of the sequence is
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
       <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       , where i also represents the position of the item in the ranking
       of the MP ones.
     * Random The random recommender simply creates sequences composed of
       ratings that contain an item randomly sampled from a uniform
       probability distribution. The seed rating is discarded and the
       probability of observing the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       is
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
       <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> <mo>/</mo>
       <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       , where
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi
       mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
       represents the number of items available in the system.
     * Unigram The unigram recommender can generate sequences that contain
       ratings with items sampled with a probability proportional to the
       number of times they were observed in the training sequences. In
       particular, the probability of observing the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       is equal to the number of ratings containing
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       divided by the total number of ratings available in the training
       sequences. As with the previous baselines, the seed rating is
       ignored during the recommendation phase.
     * Bigram The bigram recommender estimates the 1-st order transition
       probabilities among all possible pair of items available in the
       training sequences. The add-one smoothing technique is exploited to
       avoid the attribution of a strict zero probability to the pairs
       that were not observed during the training phase [46]. At
       recommendation time, the seed rating is exploited for selecting the
       first item, and then each item will influence the choice of the
       next one. The probability of sampling item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       after item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo>−</mo>
       <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
       is equal to the number of times this transition occurred in the
       training sequences plus one divided by the total number of
       transitions available.

5. Experimental Analysis

   In this section, we perform an experimental analysis of Sequeval by
   relying on its implementation described in Section 4.3 for comparing
   the behavior of the four baselines with a recommender system based on
   Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [47] and another one that exploits
   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [48]. The purpose of this comparison is
   to assess the validity of the framework by conducting an offline
   evaluation in a realistic scenario. Furthermore, we aim to investigate
   the efficiency of the proposed approach by analyzing the amount of time
   required to compute the numerical scores per each recommender system,
   considering datasets of different sizes.

5.1. Experimental Setup

   The main parameters that need to be specified according to our
   evaluation framework are the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   value used to generate the sequences, the splitting protocol, and the
   length of the recommended sequences k. The
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   value and the splitting protocol depend on the dataset and they are
   reported in Section 5.2. For performing this empirical analysis, we
   have decided to exploit the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>80</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   of the dataset for training the recommenders and the remaining
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>20</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for testing purposes. The length of the recommended sequences depends
   on the specifications of the target application: for this evaluation,
   we have chosen to set
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>k</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>5</mn> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   To compute the metric of diversity, we have selected the cosine
   similarity among the training sequences as the proximity measure
   between two items. In fact, we assume that two items are similar if
   they appear the same number of times inside the same training
   sequences. Furthermore, we have assumed that if an item is unknown, its
   similarity with another one is zero by definition.
   In the following, we provide the rationale for the usage and the
   implementation details of the two RSs based on CRF and RNN.

   CRF
          We have implemented a CRF-based recommender system using the
          CRFsuite software package
          (http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite). Since we are
          interested in predicting an item given the previous one, we have
          considered to be feature vectors the training sequences without
          their last rating and as corresponding output vectors the same
          sequences without their first rating. We have used the gradient
          descent algorithm with the L-BFGS method [49] as the training
          technique. We have chosen to generate both the state and the
          transition features that do not occur in the dataset and we have
          set the maximum number of iterations allowed for the
          optimization algorithm to 100.

   RNN
          We have also experimented with a sequence recommender,
          originally designed for the tourism domain, based on RNN [50]
          that are specifically meant to deal with sequential data.
          The hyper-parameters of the network have been optimized through
          a manual search on the validation set in [50], obtaining:
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi>

          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>dropout</mi> <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>0.2</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>learning</mi> <mo>_</mo>
          <mi>rate</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.0001</mn> </mrow> </semantics>
          :MATH]
          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi>
          <mo>_</mo> <mi>hidden</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>64</mn> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          , and

          <mo>_</mo> <mi>epochs</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>10</mn> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          . The main difference of RNNs with respect to standard
          feed-forward neural networks is the presence of a hidden state
          variable
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>h</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          , whose value depends both on the input data presented at time
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>x</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          and on the previously hidden state
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>h</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi>
          <mo>−</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
           [48] using loop connections. A typical application of RNNs in
          neural language modeling is the generation of text by
          recursively applying a “next word prediction” [51]. In the same
          spirit, we address the problem of next item prediction. The
          probability of the next rating given the previous ones
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi
          mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>k</mi> </msub> <mo>|</mo> <mrow>

          </semantics> :MATH]
          is learned during the training process of the neural network
          without the need for specifying a particular memory window as in
          Markov models.

   For conducting this experimental campaign, we relied on a machine
   equipped with two 12-cores Intel Xeon processors (E5-2680 v3 at
   2.50 GHz) and 128 GB of RAM. However, note that sequeval is a
   single-threaded application and its memory requirements are actually
   much lower, around 2.5 GB with the most demanding dataset at our
   disposal.

5.2. Datasets

   We have performed the experimental analysis considering two different
   datasets, namely Yes.com and Foursquare. The former is related to the
   musical domain, while the latter deals with check-ins performed at
   specific POIs.
   Because we are interested in modeling sequences, it is important that
   the temporal information available is actually meaningful. For example,
   the popular MovieLens datasets [52] cannot be exploited for our
   purposes because the timestamps are associated with the action of
   assigning a rating on the platform and not with the action of watching
   a movie. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, if we apply
   Algorithm 1 to the MovieLens 1M dataset with
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn>
   <mspace width="4pt" /> <mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   , we obtain unrealistic sequences with an average length of about 56
   movies.
   The Yes.com and Foursquare datasets are characterized by a different
   distribution of their items, i.e., songs and venue categories, as it
   can be observed from Figure 2. In particular, Foursquare contains few
   items that are extremely popular, while Yes.com presents a plot that is
   smoother. This conclusion is numerically supported by the values of
   entropy [53] obtained for the two distributions, which are
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>4.95</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   for Foursquare and
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>6.75</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   for Yes.com. Furthermore, the number of sequences available in
   Foursquare is about 40 times higher with respect to Yes.com. Table 1
   summarizes the number of users, items, ratings, and sequences available
   in these datasets, which are described in detail in the following
   sections.

5.2.1. Yes.com

   This dataset contains several playlists originally collected by Shuo
   Chen from Yes.com in the context of his research on Metric
   Embedding [15]. Such website provided a set of APIs
   (http://web.archive.org/web/20150316134941/http://api.yes.com) for
   programmatically retrieving songs aired by different radio stations in
   the United States. By crawling them in the period from December 2010 to
   May 2011, he managed to obtain
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>840</mn> <mo>,</mo>
   <mn>553</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   transitions. Even if Yes.com is no longer active, the playlist dataset
   is publicly available
   (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/lme/data_page.html).
   Yes.com does not include the timestamps, but only the playlists.
   Therefore, we have assumed that each playlist represents a sequence, as
   defined in our evaluation framework. In this case, it is not necessary
   to apply Algorithm 1 because the sequences are already available in the
   dataset in an explicit form. Because a timestamp-based splitting is not
   feasible, we have selected, for this dataset, a random splitting
   protocol for dividing the sequences between training and test set.
   Since we do not have any information regarding the radio stations, it
   is necessary to consider the playlists as if they were created by the
   same user. This approximation is acceptable in the context of sequence
   recommendation and it is allowed by the evaluation framework. In fact,
   differently from traditional evaluation approaches, all the metrics
   that we propose are averaged over the sequences and not over the users.
   Because of the computational complexity of the task, we have randomly
   reduced the complete dataset 10 times its original size and we have
   pruned the songs that appear less than 50 times.

5.2.2. Foursquare

   The second dataset that we have selected for performing the
   experimental evaluation of the framework is similar to the one
   described in [50] and it was created following the same protocol.
   We collected the check-ins performed by the users of the Foursquare
   Swarm mobile application (https://www.swarmapp.com) and publicly shared
   on Twitter from the Twitter API. Then, we retrieved the category of the
   place associated with the check-in thanks to the Foursquare API. For
   this reason, the items of the dataset are represented by the venue
   categories available in the Foursquare taxonomy
   (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories). The
   collection phase lasted from October to December 2017.
   To avoid exploiting the interactions generated by automated scripts, we
   have discarded the users that performed multiple check-ins in less than
   one minute. We have also pruned the check-ins associated with the venue
   categories that are usually not of interest for a tourist, for example
   the ones related to workplaces. For generating the sequences more
   efficiently, we decided to also remove the users that have performed
   less than 10 check-ins in total.
   We have set the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   parameter of the evaluation framework to 8 h. Regarding the splitting
   protocol, we have selected the timestamp-based one, considering the
   timestamp associated with the first rating as the timestamp of the
   sequence.

5.3. Results

   Table 2 summarizes the figures of the evaluation conducted with
   Yes.com. The MP recommender achieved a fair precision, but at the price
   of a very low coverage, because its predictions are deterministic.
   Unsurprisingly, the lowest precision and the highest novelty and
   diversity are associated with the random recommender. In contrast, the
   unigram, the bigram, and the CRF recommenders obtained comparable
   scores of precision, but the bigram is the most appealing of these
   three techniques, because of its lower perplexity and higher novelty.
   We can observe that the RNN recommender achieved the highest precision
   and the lowest perplexity, resulting in be the most promising algorithm
   for future online experimentations. Its nDPM is slightly lower than
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , meaning that the items are usually predicted in the correct order. We
   can also observe that its serendipity is close to the value of
   precision: for this reason, it is possible to assume that most of the
   sequences are not obvious.
   Table 3 lists, instead, the results obtained with Foursquare. In this
   case, the MP recommender system accounted for the highest precision,
   meaning that the top-5 items are extremely widespread, but, as usual,
   its coverage is very limited, and it achieved the lowest novelty. On
   the other hand, the random recommender scored the lowest precision, and
   the highest coverage and novelty. The differences among the unigram,
   the bigram, and the CRF recommenders are more striking than in the
   previous experiment: with this dataset, the unigram accounted for
   higher precision because of the popularity of some items, while the
   bigram for the lowest perplexity.
   The RNN recommender system obtained the second-best precision and
   perplexity, resulting in a good compromise if we are interested in
   optimizing both these metrics. Its fair coverage and the low value of
   serendipity are other hints of the fact that the Foursquare dataset
   contains few items that are very popular: this characteristic was, in
   fact, learned and exploited by the recommender.
   Finally, we report in Table 4 the amount of time needed for computing
   the previously described evaluation metrics per recommendation
   algorithm with the Foursquare and Yes.com datasets. We observe that in
   the worst case, the evaluation framework was able to conduct an
   experimental campaign in a few hours. The metric of diversity was the
   most computationally expensive one because of the time needed to
   compute the cosine similarity. This fact is particularly evident if we
   consider the seconds spent to evaluate the random recommender with the
   Foursquare dataset.
   As expected, the baseline recommenders are less demanding with respect
   to the CRF and RNN models. However, this analysis is beyond the scope
   of this work, as we are only interested in optimizing the evaluation
   framework. If we do not consider the metric of diversity, we observe
   that the time required for the evaluation phase is linear with respect
   to the size of the dataset.

5.4. Discussion

   In the following, we will analyze the results of the empirical analysis
   to justify the answers to the research questions that were provided in
   Section 3 and in Section 4. In particular, our main aim is to explain
   why it is necessary to rely on a framework that includes several
   metrics to evaluate a sequence-based recommender system.
   In Section 3 we have introduced the concept of rating and we have
   defined it considering three different elements: an item, a user, and a
   timestamp. The idea of associating a user with an item is the basic
   principle of almost every recommender, while the timestamp is necessary
   in order to introduce a temporal dimension, and, therefore, the
   possibility of creating and suggesting sequences, as proposed in RQ1.
   Nevertheless, we have successfully applied our evaluation framework in
   an experiment based on the Yes.com dataset, which does not include any
   user. Even though a more general use case has been considered during
   its formalization, it is possible to also exploit it in other
   scenarios, still obtaining an interesting picture of the recommenders.
   As described in Section 4.2, our answer to RQ2 is an evaluation
   framework that includes eight different metrics, capable of capturing
   the various characteristics of the algorithms available. For example,
   even if the precision of the MP recommender system is very high when
   tested with Foursquare, we can immediately discard it because of its
   low coverage. In the same way, the interesting values of diversity and
   novelty achieved by the random recommender are associated with an
   unacceptable score of perplexity.
   In Table 5 we present an interpretation of the metrics available in the
   framework. These descriptions are meant to offer a human understanding
   of the results of the offline evaluation. It is worth noticing that
   these metrics consider only some of the properties of a recommender
   system [18]. However, it is our opinion that those properties are the
   most salient ones that can be analyzed in our context, without
   realizing a live system.
   The different characteristics of the datasets exploited during the
   empirical analysis are reflected in their respective figures. In
   particular, while the values of precision obtained by the random
   recommender in the two experiments are comparable, the figures
   associated with both MP and unigram methods are dramatically different.
   This fact suggests that Foursquare contains a few items that are
   extremely popular, as it was already clear from Figure 2.
   On the other hand, the RNN recommender obtained, with both datasets,
   comparable values of precision, but a very different coverage. For this
   reason, we can suppose that this approach, differently from the CRF
   recommender, is capable of better adapting itself to the
   characteristics of the dataset. The fact that we can draw such a
   conclusion supports the validity of Sequeval.
   Furthermore, we have observed that the amount of time required to
   compute the evaluation metrics is linear with respect to the dataset
   size, if we do not consider the metric of diversity. In fact, the
   computational cost of the cosine similarity was too elevated when we
   analyzed the behavior of the random recommender with a more demanding
   dataset. However, because of the modular structure of sequeval, it is
   easy to avoid computing the metric of diversity for such a recommender.
   In line with RQ3, we have described in Section 4.3 four different
   baseline recommenders. From the results of the experiments, it is
   possible to observe that the values obtained by some of them are fixed.
   For example, the MP recommender will always achieve a serendipity equal
   to 0, and a confidence equal to 1. Its perplexity is usually
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>+</mo> <mo>∞</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , if at least one of the recommended sequences is incorrect. The items
   suggested are, in fact, considered obvious by definition, and the
   algorithm is certain of the recommendation because its behavior is
   deterministic. In a similar way, the perplexity of the random
   recommender is equal to the total number of items available, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , because of the definition of perplexity provided in Section 4.2.8.
   These two baselines are methods commonly exploited in the literature
   for evaluating RSs. Additionally, we have proposed two techniques
   better suited for the sequence recommendation problem. The unigram
   recommender is similar to the MP one, but it is non-deterministic, and
   it obtained a higher novelty. In contrast, the bigram recommender is
   the most complex baseline, because it considers the previous item to
   suggest the next one. For this reason, it always achieved the lowest
   perplexity among the baselines considered.

6. Conclusions

   In this paper, we have discussed the problem of recommending sequences
   of items tailored to the needs of a certain user. We have introduced an
   offline evaluation framework, called Sequeval, capable of handling this
   novel family of RSs in an offline scenario and we have developed an
   implementation of it that is publicly available on GitHub. We have
   included in such a framework an evaluation protocol and eight different
   metrics, to better capture the characteristics of the algorithms
   considered.
   We have performed an empirical analysis of Sequeval by relying on it
   for conducting a comparison among four baselines, a CRF recommender,
   and an RNN-based one. The results have highlighted the fact that this
   framework is flexible, as it can be successfully applied in
   non-standard recommendation scenarios, such as with Yes.com, and
   complete, because of the different metrics included that consider
   several dimensions of the recommended sequences. In addition, we have
   observed that the RNN recommender system can effectively adapt itself
   to the characteristics of the training dataset. This conclusion
   supports the validity of Sequeval as a tool for conducting an offline
   experimentation.
   Nevertheless, it is important being aware of the limitations of such a
   framework. The availability of many metrics may produce results which
   are difficult to interpret, especially if we are uncertain of what are
   the most relevant dimensions in our recommendation scenario. More in
   general, this is a common limitation of offline experiments, and it
   needs to be addressed by comparing the most promising algorithms in a
   subsequent online trail.
   The formal definitions provided in Section 3 have been conceived as an
   extension of the seminal works on RSs capable of recommending
   sequences. For this reason, it is possible to set the length of the
   recommended sequences to 1 if we are interested in obtaining a single
   item. In a similar way, the item included in the seed rating can be
   exploited in order to set the context of the recommendation, but it can
   also be ignored if we want a sequence only based on the target user.
   As future work, we plan to study in more depth what are the
   relationships among the different metrics included in the framework,
   with the purpose of integrating them in a final value that expresses
   the overall quality of the recommender. Such global score should be
   related to the recommendation scenario: for example, diversity may be
   important when recommending POIs to a tourist, but less useful in the
   musical domain.
   Furthermore, it would be desirable to be able to create an evaluation
   framework that is adopted by a community of researcher when testing
   their algorithms, harmonizing the evaluation protocols and the
   interpretation of the performance of sequence-based RSs. For this
   reason, it is necessary to identify and to include in it some
   meaningful datasets, related to different domains that could be
   exploited during the evaluation phase, as well as other baselines and
   new RSs. The strategic choice of publicly releasing sequeval fosters
   further reuse and extension.
   Finally, we would like to expand our evaluation framework to also
   support the online experimentation that should be performed after the
   offline analysis. The final goal of this work is, in fact, to enable
   researchers to spend more time in realizing the recommendation
   algorithm as they can rely on an evaluation framework that has already
   been designed and validated.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer. View
