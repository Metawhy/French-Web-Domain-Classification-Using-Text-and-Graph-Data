     Celebrated composer, Laurence Rosenthal recounts his experience with
     LSD in our summer issue: THE WILD:

     I had known about drugs given to novices in mystical schools of the
     East at the beginning of their training, for the purpose of
     providing a confirming glimpse of the kind of state they might one
     day reach through their own inner work. In fact it was a motive
     related to this idea that led me to try LSD. And now the mounting
     magnificence of the hours, growing constantly more radiant, finally
     melted all resistance.

     Lisa Starr remembers beloved poet, Mary Oliver in our summer issue,
     THE WILD:

     We now know, through some of the later poems, a few of the details
     about the abuse she endured as a child, and we also know that she
     used her craft to transform not only her own suffering, but also the
     heartbreaking nature of the world—the fact, say, that everything and
     everyone is going to die—into a thing of beauty. Think of ‘Night and
     The River;’ think of the snapping turtle she found and captured in
     the city and released into a nearby pond because: “Nothing’s
     important/except that the great and cruel mystery of the world,/of
     which this is a part,/ not be denied.”

   Joseph Eid, The music over the ruins of Aleppo from AFP Correspondent.

   I came across this extraordinary photograph a few weeks ago and
   immediately thought of the title of one of Albert Ayler’s albums, an
   avant-garde jazz saxophonist, singer and composer: Music is the Healing
   Power of the Universe. Upon further reading, I learned more about
   Mohammed Anis and his determination to live, and to begin anew in the
   ruins that are today his hometown of Aleppo. Read about his story here.

   parabola-magazine:

     The Spring 2019 Issue, CHANGE & THE CHANGELESS is now available on
     newsstands and online!

     FOCUS | From the Editor

     In his heralded poem “Burnt Norton,” T.S. Eliot speaks of “The still
     point of the turning world,” a near perfect expression of Change and
     the Changeless. Eliot attended lectures in 1920s London by the
     Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, featured in this Spring 2019
     issue of Parabola; no surprise as the search for that still point is
     a perennial spiritual quest, one that has inspired seekers from the
     Buddha to Thoreau, Thomas Merton, and countless others including
     G.I. Gurdjieff, Ouspensky’s own teacher.

     If we can rest in that stillness, the sages say, we will find there
     “the peace…that surpasses all understanding”; or “I Am”; or God:
     call it what you will, it is the Center that does hold. To reach it
     requires effort and guidance. And so this issue opens with
     meditations on the changeless and change by masters of the spirit:
     Ramana Maharshi, Lewellyn Vaughan-Lee, and Adyashanti. At this
     year’s World Parliament of Religions, those who share those
     teachers’ visions and many others exchanged their practices and
     wisdoms; a report by Trebbe Johnson appears in these pages.

     This issue delves into less traditional realms as well. There is a
     powerful photo essay on sand dunes by David Ulrich; a call to
     conscience and common sense from Lucinda Herring, a pioneer of the
     green burial movement; an exploration of hidden esoteric wisdom in
     Shakespeare; and a brief visit with an extraordinary man in touch
     with both change and the changeless, Mister Fred Rogers.

     May this issue of Parabola serve you well.

     —Jeff Zaleski

   parabola-magazine:

     “Much on earth is hidden from us; but to make up for that we have
     been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other
     world, with the higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts
     and feelings are not here but in other worlds. That is why the
     philosophers say that we cannot understand the reality of things on
     earth. God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this
     earth, and His garden grew up and everything came up that could come
     up. But what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling of
     its contact with other mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak
     or is destroyed in you, the heavenly growth will die away in you.
     Then you will be indifferent to life and even grow to hate it.
     That’s what I think.”

     —Father Zossima from Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karazamov,
     trans. by Constance Garnett (New York: New American Library, 1957).

   parabola-magazine:

     “By embarking on the spiritual path, an aspirant is attempting to
     encounter silence firsthand. This is the quintessential journey in
     life–the inner sojourn. It is returning to a source long ago
     forgotten but often glimpsed at moment unawares. Recapturing that
     which flitters on the periphery of awareness is the goal of the
     mystic. …The mystic consciously dives into silence, at first unfelt.
     With repeated practice it becomes a living, palpable Presence filled
     with immeasurable vitality and boundless, nondual continuity. But
     what causes this gradual revelation?

     First we need to discover why we do not experience silence. The
     simplest answer is that we are habituated to noise. We are addicted
     to novelty, sensation, to ourselves. Fuss and commotion, mental
     chattering, and outer stimulation occupy our minds from dawn to
     dusk. The twentieth-century Japanese Zen master Nan-in rightly noted
     that we are overflowing with our own ideas and opinions; to learn
     Zen we must first empty our minds. But there is no room for such
     emptiness. When one is clattering away on a keyboard sixteen hours
     every day, the capacious pockets of silence are kept well at bay. We
     thereby deafen ourselves to the underlying silence we would
     otherwise clearly hear.“

     —John Roger Barrie: “The Deepest Silence,” from PARABOLA, VOL. 33,
     No 1., Spring 2008: Silence. Read the essay here:

     * Thursday 20th September 2018

     For me, language is a freedom. As soon as you have found the words
     with which to express something, you are no longer incoherent, you
     are no longer trapped by your own emotions, by your own experiences;
     you can describe them, you can tell them, you can bring them out of
     yourself and give them to somebody else. That is an enormously
     liberating experience, and it worries me that more and more people
     are learning not to use language; they’re giving in to the
     banalities of the television media and shrinking their vocabulary,
     shrinking their own way of using this fabulous tool that human
     beings have refined over so many centuries into this extremely
     sensitive instrument. I don’t want to make it crude, I don’t want to
     make it into shopping-list language, I don’t want to make it into
     simply an exchange of information: I want to make it into the
     subtle, emotional, intellectual, freeing thing that it is and that
     it can be.

   back.

     * Thursday 20th September 2018

     That’s the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when
     they’re suffering, when something overwhelms their ordinary, careful
     armor, and the naked child is flung out onto the world. That’s why
     the things that are worst to undergo are best to remember. But when
     that child gets buried away under their adaptive and protective
     shells - he becomes one of the walking dead, a monster. So when you
     realize you’ve gone a few weeks and haven’t felt that awful struggle
     of your childish self  - struggling to lift itself out of its
     inadequacy and incompetence - you’ll know you’ve gone some weeks
     without meeting new challenges, and without growing, and that you’ve
     gone some weeks towards losing touch with yourself. The only
     calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much
     they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated.
     And the only thing people regret is that they didn’t live boldly
     enough, that they didn’t invest enough heart, didn’t love enough.
     Nothing else really counts at all.

   Ted Hughes. With gratitude to Whiskey River.

     Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our
     experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with
     bits from movies we’ve seen, novels we’ve read, speeches we’ve
     heard, and daydreams we’ve savoured, and out of all that jumble it
     weaves a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from
     and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate
     and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to
     sacrifice my life, if that’s what the plot requires. We all have our
     genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending
     religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film,
     and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all
     just stories.

   both the white water and the eddies. Meditation may take one out of the
