   Description

   Founded in Cologne in 1898, RIMOWA has become synonymous with sleek
   design and effortless travel. Standing at a three-way intersection of
   innovation, utility, and luxury, RIMOWA has uniquely positioned itself
   as a luxury goods manufacturer focused on craftsmanship and
   dedication—never allowing trends to dictate their design. Paul Morszeck
   laid the cornerstone for the company’s success 120 years ago by placing
   a premium on impeccable construction and utmost stability. RIMOWA‘s
   success skyrocketed in the 1920s when the suitcases caught the eye of
   the world’s travelers prizing function above all else, followed by the
   launch of the first aluminum luggage in 1937 that has made all RIMOWA
   products distinctive and unique. This book celebrates 120 years of the
   functional and practical luxury brand, and the people and story behind
   it—focusing on the ingenuity and inspiration that have characterized
   RIMOWA’s innovative designs and the creative history that has laid the
   groundwork for a dynamic future.

   as a luxury goods manufacturer focused on craftsmanship and
   dedication—never allowing trends to dictate their design. Paul Morszeck
   laid the cornerstone for the company’s success 120 years ago by placing
   a premium on impeccable construction and utmost stability. RIMOWA‘s
   success skyrocketed in the 1920s when the suitcases caught the eye of
   the world’s travelers prizing function above all else, followed by the
   launch of the first aluminum luggage in 1937 that has made all RIMOWA
   products distinctive and unique. This book celebrates 120 years of the
   functional and practical luxury brand, and the people and story behind
   it—focusing on the ingenuity and inspiration that have characterized
   RIMOWA’s innovative designs and the creative history that has laid the
   groundwork for a dynamic future.
