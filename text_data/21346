Best Avocado Egg Salad Toast

   Not your average avocado toast! This Best Avocado Egg Salad Toast is
   layered with lemon-y smashed avocado, a simplified egg salad, and
   everything bagel seasoning. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or snacks!

Best Avocado Egg Salad Toast

   These days, it seems every hip breakfast joint and bumping lunch spot
   has their own version of avocado toast.  Maybe you do too. But then
   again, maybe you don’t. Maybe you happily shell out $12 for that
   perfect Instagram-worthy masterpiece, and don’t even realize you could
   be doing it yourself at home.

   Which is exactly why I thought you might like to see my version. One
   that happens to rival the prettiness of those $12 toasts, and also
   rivals the bang for you buck as well.

   Here’s what’s happening:
     * Your favorite exceedingly grainy whole-wheat toast (I was recently
       gifted this brand and I’m in LOVE)
     * Smashed avocado laced with lemon juice, salt, and pepper
     * Hard-boiled eggs, chopped, and tossed with a touch of mayo, dijon
       and salt. Basically a fussed-down version of egg salad.
     * A sprinkling of everything bagel seasoning.


The Perfect Breakfast

   This my friends, is my idea of breakfast/snack/lunch heaven. Despite
   the ease of preparation, the flavors are complex and DELICIOUS. It’s
   filling, but light, which is always what I’m wanting in the morning.
   And for those of you who are suckers for something pretty, well, it’s
   obvious to see this is P-R-E-T-T-Y.

   I like to keep the avocado pretty straight forward. All I need is a
   little bit of acid and tanginess from lemon juice, plenty of salt, and
   just a touch of pepper. I also like to keep a little bit of texture in
   it, so I don’t completely mash up the avocado. This is a personal
   choice. The taste, obviously, will be the same.

   Like I stated before, the egg portion, is basically just a simplified
   version of my favorite egg salad. Because this recipe is all about
   simplicity, I opted out of some of my standard egg salad ingredients
   (pickles, dill, Worcestershire sauce). Instead I added just enough mayo
   to bind the yolks and whites together, a touch of dijon for little bit
   of spiciness (plus I think it compliments the lemon in the avocado
   perfectly), and again, plenty of salt and a little bit of pepper.

   Once all the ingredients are piled on top, a final dusting of
   everything bagel seasoning finishes it off.

Ways to take this completely over the top

     * Sprinkle the top with chopped crispy bacon
     * Grate fresh parmesan cheese on top
     * Truffle salt. Need I say more?
     * Nestle smoked salmon on top of the avocado, then top with egg salad

Substitutions and Tips and Tricks for Recipe Success

     * Use whatever toast floats your boat, just make sure it’s sturdy
       enough to stand up to the rest of the components.
     * Swap out dijon for regular mustard
     * Swap out lime juice for lemon in a pinch
     * If you don’t have everything bagel seasoning, mix a little bit of
       granulated garlic, onion, salt, sesame seed, and poppy seed
       together.

   Breakfast things to serve with Avocado Toast
     * 5-Ingredient Stovetop Granola
     * Baklava Cinnamon Rolls
     * Best Ever Quiche Lorraine
