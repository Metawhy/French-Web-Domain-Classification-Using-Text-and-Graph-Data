Privacy Statement

   Last updated September 2019

APPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT

   Users of Mixpanel, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies
   (“Mixpanel”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) trust us when they come to our
   website or use our services. This privacy statement is to further that
   trust by being transparent with our privacy practices regarding
   personal information (as defined below) that we collect, use, share and
   secure from: (i) visitors to https://mixpanel.com (the “Site”); (ii)
   users who register to use our online, web-based platform for analytics
   services (the “Services” and such users, the “Customers”); and (iii)
   users of our mobile applications (“Application(s)”). If you are a
   Mixpanel Customer, this statement also describes your choices regarding
   use, access and correction of your personal information. The use of
   information collected through our data analytics platform is governed
   by our Terms of Use and shall be limited to the purpose of providing
   the service for which the Customer has engaged Mixpanel. This privacy
   statement is not intended to discuss the collection or use of personal
   information by a Customer’s use of the Services and does not apply to
   third-party websites, applications, or services that display or link to
   different privacy statements.  Because a Customer’s collection or use
   of personal information is specific to their use and implementation of
   the Services, please consult a Customer’s privacy statement or the
   written contract between a Customer and Mixpanel for the Services for
   more information.  For additional detail, please see the Analytics
   Platform Activities section below. If you have questions or complaints
   regarding this privacy statement or our privacy practices, please
   contact us at compliance@mixpanel.com.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

   We collect information, including personal information, in various ways
   when you use our Site, Applications and Services. As used in this
   statement, “personal information” means any information which, either
   alone or in combination with other information, identifies you as an
   individual, such as your name, mailing address, and email address.
   Information You Provide Us We collect information, including personal
   information, you provide us voluntarily. For example:
     * When you enter in your first and last name, email address, and
       password when you create an account to access the Services
       (“Account”) or otherwise enter similar information into forms or
       surveys on our Site or Applications.
     * When you enter information using your Account, including postal
       address, phone number, fax number, company name and credit card
       payment information.
     * If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device
       to send us your location), we may store and use that information
       for internal analytics purposes.

   Information Collected Via Technology We automatically collect certain
   information via technology:
     * IP Address, Location and Browser Information. When you visit our
       Site or use our Applications, some information is automatically
       collected. This may include information such as the operating
       system (“OS”) running on your device, internet protocol address
       (“IP Address”) (which may be used to obtain your geolocation),
       access times, browser type, language settings of the OS, and the
       website you visited before our Site. We also collect information
       about how you use Mixpanel’s Site, Applications and Services,
       including the elements you have interacted with, metadata and other
       details about these elements, clicks, change states and other user
       actions.
     * Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “pixel tags” (also referred to as
       clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic
       images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies (as
       noted below), that are used to track online movements of web users.
       In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard
       drive, pixel tags are embedded in web pages. Pixel tags also allow
       us to send email messages and determine whether those emails have
       been opened, to ensure that we are sending only messages that are
       of interest to our Customers. We may use this information to reduce
       or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information
       gathered by pixel tags to our users’ personal information.
     * Browser Local Storage: We also store data locally on your device to
       enhance the user experience on our Site. For example, browser local
       storage allows us to save the state of your current page so that
       when you return at a later time or refresh the browser, the page
       will remain the same. We may also use browser local storage to: (i)
       save a list of items the user last used on the Site or Services
       (such as events and properties the user selected) so we can display
       “recently viewed items”; or (ii) marking once a user has seen a
       tutorial, video, tooltip or onboarding flow so that the user only
       sees the content one time.
     * Mobile Services. We may also collect information from your mobile
       device, such as but not exclusively the first time the Application
       is opened, mobile carrier, the device identifier (or “UDID”), and
       the type of device that is being used,  if you have downloaded our
       Applications. This information is generally used to help us deliver
       the most relevant information to you and improve our Services and
       analytics platform. Examples of information that may be collected
       and used include how you use the Applications and information about
       the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our
       Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive
       information about your mobile device model and OS version, which
       allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the
       performance of our Applications. We send you push notifications
       from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or
       promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive
       these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device
       level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to
       collect certain information about your device such as operating
       system and user identification information. We use mobile analytics
       software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our
       Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information
       such as how often you use the application, the events that occur
       within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and
       where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the
       information we store within the analytics software to any
       personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile
       application.

   Access and Control of the Information We Collect We recognize an
   individual’s right to control the type of personal information that is
   collected about them. Our Customers can view, edit, or delete their
   personal information at any time. Mixpanel retains your personal
   information while you are a Customer and will delete your personal
   information upon request. Customers may also send requests for access
   to your personal information by emailing support@mixpanel.com. Mixpanel
   will respond to any request to delete Customer personal information
   within a reasonable timeframe. As discussed in the introduction, this
   privacy statement does not apply to the end-users tracked by our
   Customers. If you are a customer of a Mixpanel Customer, please contact
   that Mixpanel Customer for access to your personal information.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

   In general, we use the information we collect primarily to provide,
   maintain, protect, and improve our current products and to develop new
   ones.  This may include collection to:

       network;
     * Identify you as a user in our Services;
     * Improve our Services, Applications, Site and how we operate our
       business;
     * Understand and enhance your experience using our Site, products and
       Services;
     * Provide and deliver products and services you request;
     * Respond to your comments or questions and for our Support team to

       parties, to help understand your needs and provide you with better
       service, as described under Profiling below; and

       illegal activity.

   User Feedback We often receive feedback and comments about our Services
   from users  of our Services. If we choose to use your feedback on the
   Site we will request permission to include names of individuals. We may
   also include a profile picture along with your feedback. If you wish to
   update or delete your feedback, you can contact us at
   compliance@mixpanel.com. Creation of De-Identified Data We may
   create de-identified data records from personal information by
   excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data
   personally identifiable to you. We use this de-identified  data to
   analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content
   of our Services and improve Applications and Site navigation. We
   reserve the right to use de-identified data for any purpose and
   disclose de-identified  data to third parties in our sole discretion.
   Profiling When you interact with our Site by completing a form (such as
   a request for us to contact you, request for information on pricing, or
   downloading content) we will collect your personal information and
   analyze your information to build individual profiles. We use third
   party tools to help us build the profile by providing firmographics:
   company size and industry for example. These profiles will be used to
   help us predict future interest in our Services. The profiling is based
   on your activity on our Site such as what you are reading or
   downloading and is updated in real-time based on your activity on the
   Site. Sharing of Information We do not share your personal information
   with third parties without your consent other than:
     * Third Party Service Providers. With third parties who work on our
       behalf, provided that such third parties subscribe to the
       Principles (as defined below), have entered into an applicable data
       processing agreement, or provide at least the same level of privacy
       protection as required by the Principles or other applicable
       privacy regulations to offer the Services. These companies are
       authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to
       provide these services to you. These services may include providing
       cloud computing infrastructure, website crash reporting, and
       providing customer support or account administration. If you would
       like to see the list of third parties with whom Mixpanel currently
       shares your information, you may request a copy of the list by
       emailing us at compliance@mixpanel.com;
     * Lawful Requests. To comply with laws or to respond to lawful
       requests and legal process, provided that Mixpanel will endeavor to
       notify you if Mixpanel has received a lawful request for your
       information;
     * Protection of Rights and Property. To protect the rights and
       property of Mixpanel, our agents, customers and others including to
       enforce our agreements and policies;
     * Emergency. In an emergency, including to protect the personal
       safety of any person; and
     * Corporate Restructuring. For the purposes of a business deal (or
       negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all
       or a part of our business or assets (business deals may include,
       for example, any merger, financing, acquisition, divestiture or
       dissolution transaction or proceeding). In the event of an
       insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may
       also be transferred as a business asset. If another company
       acquires our company, business or assets, that company will possess
       the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights
       and obligations regarding your personal information as described in
       this statement.

USE OF COOKIES

   Cookies are small text files placed on an individual’s computer by
   sites that the individual has visited. They are used to make websites
   work more efficiently and effectively and help us improve our Site, our
   marketing activities and your experience. Cookies may also provide
   information to the owner of a website about its users. The text in a
   cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely
   identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well.
   Specifically, we use cookies to see which areas and features are
   popular and to count visits to our Site. Most web browsers are set to
   accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can choose to set your
   browser to remove cookies or to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
   cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
   services of our Site and could remove cookies used to opt-out of
   tracking for the Services. You can control your cookie settings on our
   Site by clicking here. Mixpanel uses cookies and similar technologies
   for several purposes, including:
     * Sign-In and Authentication. When you sign into the Site using your
       username and password we store an encrypted cookie on your device.
       This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the Site
       without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save
       your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time
       you return to the site.
     * Performance. Mixpanel uses cookies for load balancing to help
       ensure that websites remain up and running.
     * Social Media. Portions of our Site include social media cookies or
       widgets, including those that enable users who are logged in to the
       social media service to share content via that service.
     * Storing Information for Purchases on the Site. When you seek to
       purchase one of our Services plans, we store the data in a cookie
       to remember the products and information you have added for
       purchase.
     * Opt-Out Cookie. When you opt-out of tracking on the Site, Mixpanel
       will store a cookie that will block other cookies from being
       stored.

   Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed below. This list is not
   exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the main reasons we
   typically set cookies. If you visit one of our sites, the site may set
   some or all of the following cookies:
     * IRB, Insights or MP: These are cookies that are used for Site
       analytics and operational purposes.
     * SESSIONID: Helps to authenticate you when you sign into your
       Account.

   Third Party Cookies In addition to the cookies listed above, third
   parties may also set cookies when you visit the Site. In some cases,
   that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on
   our behalf, such as payment processing for credit card billing. In
   other cases, it is because our web pages may contain content or ads
   from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by
   other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third
   parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are
   able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect
   information about your online activities across websites or online
   services. To control cookies from those third parties, visit their
   sites.  If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here
   (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note you will
   continue to receive generic ads. These third party cookies include:
     * Stripe
     * Facebook
     * LinkedIn
     * Twitter
     * Marketo

   ANALYTICS PLATFORM ACTIVITIES With respect to our Services, Mixpanel
   collects information under the direction of its Customers (the data
   controller), and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose
   personal information it processes. The processing of data sent from our
   Customers is governed by our Terms of Use, Data Processing Addendum or
   any other agreement agreed to and signed by Mixpanel with our
   Customers. If you are a customer of one of our Customers and would like
   more information on their use of your data,  please contact the
   Customer that you interact with directly. Mixpanel acknowledges that
   you have the right to access your personal information. An individual
   who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate
   data should direct his or her query to the Mixpanel Customer (the data
   controller) who will then provide instructions to Mixpanel, if
   necessary. If requested to remove data we will respond within a
   reasonable timeframe. We will retain personal information pursuant to
   our retention policy and will retain this personal information as
   necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
   enforce our agreements.

PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY

   Mixpanel maintains commercially reasonable administrative, technical,
   and physical safeguards to help protect your personal information in an
   effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
   alteration and destruction. However, no transmission over the internet
   is 100% secure. We encourage you to protect your usernames and
   passwords to help prevent anyone from accessing or abusing your
   accounts and services, including not using the same passwords for the
   Services that you use with other accounts. If you have any questions
   about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
   security@mixpanel.com. Children We do not intentionally gather personal
   information from visitors who are under the age of 13. If you are under
   the age of 13, you are not permitted to submit any personal information
   to us. If we learn that a child under 13 submits personal information
   to Mixpanel we will delete the information as soon as possible. If you
   believe that we might have any personal information from a child under
   13, please contact us at: compliance@mixpanel.com.

YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES

   In addition to the choices outlined in other parts of this statement,
   you also have control over the following: Email Communications. You may
   opt out of receiving promotional or marketing emails from Mixpanel by
   following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may
   still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your
   Mixpanel projects or our ongoing business relationship. Applications.
   You can stop all collection of information by an Application(s) by
   uninstalling the Application(s). You may use the standard uninstall
   processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the
   mobile application marketplace or network. Do Not Track Signals. Some
   web browsers may transmit signals instructing websites and other online
   services to not track information. There is no standard that governs
   what, if anything, websites should do if they receive these signals.
   Mixpanel currently does not respond to such browser signals or similar
   mechanisms instructing not to track information. If and when a standard
   is established, we may revise our position on responding to these
   signals. Third parties may collect personal information about your
   online activities over time and across sites when you visit our Site or
   use the Mixpanel Service. Social Media Widgets. As noted above, our
   website may include social media features, such as the Facebook and
   LinkedIn button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website.
   These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
   on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
   properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a
   third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with
   these features are governed by the privacy statement of the third party
   providing it.

   EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield
