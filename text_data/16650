   it all.

   Biamp offers audio solutions that meet the needs of virtually any

   AV-related technologies are a critical component of helping legal
   professionals do their jobs accurately and effectively.

   Biamp offers scalable, adaptable, and cost-effective paging solutions
   that are well-suited for a variety of industry applications.

   Biamp offers several room control solutions, including the Tesira HD-1
   Dialer, TEC-1 remote Ethernet control devices, and Biamp Canvas
   software.

   Ever feel overwhelmed in a noisy, distracting environment when you need
   to concentrate? Biamp's Tesira family can provide sound reinforcement
   and DSP for venues of all sizes and functions.

   right. Let Biamp help.

   Who says you need to have a big room to have a big meeting? Devio is a
   versatile AV solution for productive meetings.

   Organizations are choosing multi-use spaces that can be combined and
   configured to suit a wide range of activities. Biamp products help keep
   pace.

   Small conference rooms still have big AV needs. Biamp products offer
   scalable, flexible options designed to suit these smaller spaces.

   Executive boardrooms are where big decisions are made. Shouldn't they
   have executive-level AV as well?

   Estimating bandwidth needs, designing switch infrastructure, and
   establishing paging zones are just a few of the challenges exacerbated
   by multi-building scenarios.

   Sound masking is the process of adding an unobtrusive background sound
   to an environment that is specially designed to mask the sound of
   speech. Masked workplaces are more private, comfortable, and
   productive.

   innovation and the customer in mind. So you can feel confident that the
   Biamp products you choose for each installation will work as expected.

Fulfilling our commitment to you. An explanation of our Cookie Policy.

   Revision effective as of November 6, 2018

   Biamp Systems, LLC, (“Biamp,” “we,” “us,” “our”) respect your privacy
   and are committed to protecting the personal data we hold about you. By
   using our website with a home page located at www.biamp.com (the

   Privacy Notice. For more information about what cookies and pixel tags
   are, what they do, and how you can opt out of, manage, or delete them,
   please review this Cookie Notice.

What Are Cookies and Pixel Tags?

   “Cookies” are small strings of text or computer code stored locally on
   your device that allow us, ad networks, and our third-party service
   providers, to identify your browser and/or device as you browse the
   Internet. Cookies can be placed, read, and/or written to by our
   Services, or other websites or services that recognize a particular
   cookie, which allows the website to “remember” or “recognize” a
   particular browser or device and, in some cases, store information
   about that browser or device.

   Certain types of cookies or cookie-like functionality may be placed or
   activated through browser add-ons. While these cookies are stored
   differently, their functionality and purpose is generally similar to
   other cookies, and they are used to collect and store information about
   your preferences and navigation to, from, and within the Services.

   Cookies are often used in conjunction with “pixel tags” (also known as
   “web beacons” or “clear gifs”). Pixel tags are small images that we,
   our analytics providers, advertisers, and other third parties can use
   to interact with cookies and other tracking technologies. For example,
   we use pixel tags to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and
   marketing campaigns by determining whether you open and interact with
   the content in our promotional emails.

How Long Are Cookies Stored On My System?

   Session Cookies. “Session cookies” are stored for the duration of a
   browser session; when you close the browser, the cookie is deleted.

   Persistent Cookies. “Persistent cookies” are stored for a preset amount
   of time (often between 90 days and two years, depending on the
   application) and are typically not deleted when a browser session is
   closed.

What Cookies Do We Use, and Why?

   convenient or may prevent certain functionality (such as the remaining
   logged in) from working correctly.

   Third-Party Functionality. We do not have access to or control over
   cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may
   use, and the information practices of those advertisers and third party
   websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Cookie Notice.

   For example, we provide social media buttons on the Services that allow
   users to visit, share, or bookmark web pages through third-party social
   media platforms. We do not control how those platforms collect
   information about you, nor whether or how they may track you or may
   activate their own cookies on your computer.

How Do I Control or Make Choices About Cookies and Tracking Technologies?

   calls in huddle rooms or board rooms, Biamp has devices that can manage
   it all.

   Biamp offers audio solutions that meet the needs of virtually any
   educational institution. Our future-proof DSP offerings are designed
   for longevity, helping administrators achieve their AV goals while

   their congregations engaged.

   Biamp's solutions for hospitality venues offer scalable options, so you
   can fulfill the broadest range of requirements - from huge arenas to

   AV-related technologies are a critical component of helping legal
   professionals do their jobs accurately and effectively.

   Biamp offers scalable, adaptable, and cost-effective paging solutions
   that are well-suited for a variety of industry applications.

   Biamp offers several room control solutions, including the Tesira HD-1
   Dialer, TEC-1 remote Ethernet control devices, and Biamp Canvas
   software.

   Ever feel overwhelmed in a noisy, distracting environment when you need
   to concentrate? Biamp's Tesira family can provide sound reinforcement
   and DSP for venues of all sizes and functions.

   In an emergency, reliable voice evacuation technology saves lives.
   Trust Vocia as part of your emergency communications system.

   Businesses are increasingly incorporating VoIP technology into their
   day-to-day operations. However, that doesn't mean it's easy to get
   right. Let Biamp help.

   Who says you need to have a big room to have a big meeting? Devio is a
   versatile AV solution for productive meetings.

   Organizations are choosing multi-use spaces that can be combined and
   configured to suit a wide range of activities. Biamp products help keep
   pace.

   Small conference rooms still have big AV needs. Biamp products offer
   scalable, flexible options designed to suit these smaller spaces.

   Executive boardrooms are where big decisions are made. Shouldn't they
   have executive-level AV as well?

   Estimating bandwidth needs, designing switch infrastructure, and
   establishing paging zones are just a few of the challenges exacerbated
   by multi-building scenarios.

   Sound masking is the process of adding an unobtrusive background sound
   to an environment that is specially designed to mask the sound of
   speech. Masked workplaces are more private, comfortable, and
   productive.

   The technology behind all of Biamp's products is designed with
   innovation and the customer in mind. So you can feel confident that the
   Biamp products you choose for each installation will work as expected.

   Perfect for participants and moderators of presentations, lectures,
   panel discussions or other similar events. Empower your event audiences
   to speak, text, and vote directly from their smartphones.
