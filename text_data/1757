   The majority of contracts are lacking basic elements that could enable
   better vendor performance and cost savings. Here’s how companies can
   tighten the rein.

   Most industries have a large majority of their spending locked in
   contracts: companies in utilities, aerospace and defense, and food
   manufacturing can have 90 percent or more of their annual revenues
   represented in contracts with suppliers and vendors. Despite this
   outsized share, the majority of organizations invest relatively limited
   resources in contract development and vendor management. In fact,
   across industries, total procurement operating expenses are typically
   less than 1 percent of total spending.^1 1. “5 common references for
   procurement benchmarking,” Purchasing & Procurement Center, accessed
   January 5, 2018, purchasing-procurement-center.com. By underinvesting
   in this way, companies are overlooking a significant source of value:
   suboptimal contract terms and conditions combined with a lack of
   effective contract management can cause an erosion of value in sourcing
   equal to 9 percent of annual revenues. For Fortune’s 2016 Global 500
   companies, this 9 percent would have equaled $2.5 trillion in value. ^2

   Several factors contribute to this lack of oversight and contract
   management: large procurement functions execute and monitor tens of
   thousands of contracts annually, on average, so the sheer volume can be
   overwhelming. Lack of procurement resources or ownership tends to shift
   contractor management to the users in the functions requiring the
   product or service who are usually not trained to do it effectively. In
   addition, 80 percent of procurement functions are not fully aware of
   competitive terms and contract structure.^3 3.2015 IACCM Benchmarking
   Study, PWC. Since contracts establish the “rules of the game” for the
   supplier relationship, they are a critical factor in generating value,
   particularly for services. Without a point of reference for what good
   looks like, bringing contracts in line with industry standards is not
   possible. Last, procurement often takes a narrow view of business value
   in setting terms and conditions, meaning that significant enablers for
   future value creation from demand, operations, contract management, or
   supply chain are often not incorporated into the contracts. All of
   these factors limit a company’s ability to get better performance from
   their suppliers and vendors.

   To determine specific contract areas where companies are falling short,
   McKinsey conducted research that examined every facet of contract
   development and execution and found that companies face challenges in
   three parts of the contracting process—precontracting, contract
   writing, and implementation and vendor management. In our experience,
   the key to optimizing the entire process is an approach called
   contracting for performance—a formal agreement with a supplier that
   sets specific rewards and penalties for achieving, or failing to
   achieve, performance levels that affect the bottom line. As a first
   step, companies must recognize the common pitfalls to writing and
   executing contracts as well as the essential elements of effective
   contracts. Next, executives should seek to implement strategies that
   support more effective engagement in the precontracting, contract
   writing, and implementation and management phases. These actions can
   enable procurement organizations to build the capabilities and
   expertise to write contracts that deliver better performance.

The state of contracting

   Over the past year, McKinsey’s Rapid Procurement Contract Insights
   (RPCI) service line has reviewed more than 100 contracts against a
   comprehensive assessment grid of more than 60 criteria. This analysis
   revealed that the majority of procurement contracts fall well short on
   a range of basic contract elements related to performance. In general,
   contracts for indirect spending in our sample tended to be written more
   effectively than those for direct spending, but no particular industry
   or spending category outperformed others consistently. As most reviewed
   contracts represented some of the top-spending categories, it was more
   likely that the indirect spending contracts were centrally managed and
   therefore might have received greater scrutiny at the time of
   completion than their direct spending counterparts. For direct
   spending, we have observed that a lot of emphasis on getting the right
   product to the right place at the right time, so contracts tend to be
   more robust on product specifications and delivery terms as opposed to
   total cost of ownership. More specifically, our analysis assessed
   contracts across three dimensions:

1. General terms and conditions

   More than 75 percent of contracts in our sample did not include an
   exhaustive set of key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting
   processes linked to total cost of ownership. Procurement professionals
   cite various reasons for contract gaps with regard to KPIs and
   reporting. At the performance-measurement level, many professionals do
   not have the category expertise to measure overall vendor performance
   in a given category or effectively quantify how vendor performance
   affects costs. Others are unable to define easily measured KPIs or lack
   the capabilities and resources to track supplier performance. Still
   others believe their organization can’t effectively negotiate
   performance KPIs with their suppliers, instead accepting vendor terms.
   Of the remaining 25 percent, contracts for indirect spending categories
   were more likely to have exhaustive sets of KPIs and reporting
   mechanisms included compared with contracts in direct spending
   categories. For direct spending, procurement professionals often assume
   that quality and performance are static requirements that should be
   evaluated on a pass-fail basis.

   In addition, clauses that define rules for subcontracting were absent
   in one-quarter of the sample. Contracts related to direct categories
   had subcontracting rules that were more poorly defined, on average,
   compared with those in contracts for indirect categories. This effect
   can be explained in part by the fact that more direct spending
   contracts are supply contracts, whereas indirect spending contracts
   more often require vendors to perform services at a client’s site. When
   third-party personnel gain access to client sites, the risks that come
   with subcontracting increase. But for direct contracts, the supplier is
   mistakenly often not seen as a potential risk.

2. Commercial terms and conditions

   In our sample, eight out of every ten contracts did not contain any
   form of a benchmarking clause, which mandates a periodic review of
   pricing against industry standards or relevant indices to ensure that
   vendors and suppliers are charging prices in line with fair and
   reasonable market rates. Since a benchmarking clause would allow for
   much stronger cost controls, we regularly find opportunities for
   procurement to improve contracts in this regard. But all too often,
   benchmarking clauses feature generic language that allows the buyer to
   benchmark prices at similar companies only. A bottom-up cost
   benchmarking potentially linked to a “should cost” based understanding
   of supplier economics would be much more effective to determine
   additional opportunities to capture value.

   Similarly, clauses that cap pricing adjustments for inflation were not
   included in nearly 40 percent of contracts. Indirect spending
   categories were twice as likely to have contracts with some form of
   inflation adjustment clause compared with contracts for direct
   categories. This omission is relevant for several reasons. Inflation
   rates are calculated based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) measurements.
   According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI typically
   measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
   consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.”
   Depending on the specific product or service that a supplier may
   provide to a customer, the direct relationship of this good (or of some
   share of its cost) to a general basket of consumer goods and services
   is certainly questionable.

3. Partnership and governance conditions

   A critical lever in generating more value from contracts is partnership
   and governance conditions, which enable closer collaboration and
   contract governance between buyers and suppliers. Despite its
   importance, our analysis uncovered some key gaps: in almost 20 percent
   of cases, contracts did not contain any process definitions for
   continuous improvements. What’s more, half of all contracts we reviewed
   did not include clauses related to the establishment of governance
   bodies and escalation paths to manage contract life cycles. Many
   contracts include only very vague contract language stating that, for
   example, “the parties will work together on continuous improvement
   efforts.” Such language does not specify responsibility for achieving
   goals nor any details on how any of the tasks would be tracked,
   reviewed, or implemented.

   An examination of the impact of these contracting gaps reinforces the
   value at stake: poor supplier performance can result in higher total
   costs of 10 to 20 percent in the contracted category (Exhibit 1). When
   suppliers fall short, it can result in shadow or downstream costs that
   lie beyond the view of procurement when negotiating the initial
   purchase price and contract terms that do not incorporate a life cycle
   total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective. For example, one industrial
   manufacturing company experienced significant rework in some commodity
   segments, resulting in additional costs equal to 30 to 50 percent of
   revenues. Late deliveries can have a knock-on effect, requiring
   manufacturers to pay additional overtime or credit customers for
   delays.

Contracting for performance

   The myriad variables involved in negotiating, writing, and enforcing
   contracts means that incremental efforts to improve vendor performance
   will likely fail to capture significant value. Instead, a comprehensive
   approach to the contracting process and project delivery is required.
   Contracting for performance can help reduce costs and achieve value
   beyond the contract’s original scope by shifting responsibility from
   buyer to supplier and specifying deliverables, performance monitoring,
   and management processes. These contracts define metrics and acceptable
   quality levels as part of the scope of work and establish a clear
   governance structure for reporting and monitoring continuous
   improvement. The distinctive advantage of performance-based contracts
   is that operational efficiencies are guaranteed by the supplier. Such
   assurance comes from not only the inclusion of performance metrics,
   penalties, and monitoring but also performance incentives and
   gain-share mechanisms that are typically common in partnerships.

   When seeking to improve contract writing and vendor management, it can
   be instructive to segment the contract process into three
   phases—precontracting, contract writing, and implementation and
   management. In our experience, procurement organizations face a range
   of challenges in these areas, and contracting for performance can
   directly address them.

Precontracting

   During the initial development of contracts, negotiations often fail to
   address all relevant aspects for contracting, implementation, and
   ongoing vendor management for a variety of reasons. Legal, contracting
   teams, and other stakeholders may not be involved early enough in
   contract negotiations or are not sufficiently engaged throughout the
   process. In some instances, a lack of time and resources can impede
   sufficient preparation among procurement, legal, and the business. In
   others, an overemphasis during negotiations on how responsibility and
   value will be divided can lead to lengthy, antagonistic negotiations
   that alienate the contracting parties and lead to a similarly lengthy
   and antagonistic vendor management process.

   Companies that adopt contracting for performance can empower functions
   and stakeholders to clearly define priorities and performance targets.
   By getting all relevant parties involved at the outset of the process,
   procurement can start with a comprehensive perspective on TCO and value
   creation. Contract negotiations can then start by creating a shared
   vision or statement of intent that can be used as a basis to regularly
   revisit and emphasize integrative issues. Integrative issues are
   opportunities to expand the value for both sides (“win-win”) or where
   the interests of both sides are aligned. An example of an integrative
   issue is the length of contract: it costs the buyer nothing (if
   properly written) and adds tremendous value to the supplier. Achieving
   consensus also facilitates other important tasks that can keep the
   contract on track throughout the process:
     * Articulate scope of services with commercial and legal terms while
       removing ambiguity
     * Ensure value capture is addressed and translated to the contracting
       priorities across all TCO levers over the expected life cycle of
       the product or service
     * Develop a perspective on the main cost drivers of the product or
       service, and verify any adjustments or escalation clauses are
       linked to the right baseline cost elements
     * Define performance based on mutually agreed upon targets
     * Develop an appropriate reward and penalty structure for vendors
       (and potentially also the buyer) to encourage the expected
       performance
     * Commit resources from the organization and suppliers to engage in a
       formal review process

Contract writing

   The task of writing contracts is obviously affected, and sometimes
   complicated, by the results of the precontracting phase. When
   negotiation results are handed to legal with the direction to “just
   formalize the contract,” the final document can consist of legal
   contract language that may be difficult for other stakeholders to
   understand and use to manage the vendor. Further, procurement may
   emphasize certain performance levels during the formulation of the
   contract that are not in alignment with business goals. Last, tight
   timelines can also produce contracts that are prepared in a rush
   without adequate consideration from relevant parties. To save time, for
   example, companies might opt to use a vendor template. All of these
   factors can undermine efforts to define vendor performance levels.

   Aligning KPIs to strategic objectives

   To ensure that performance-based KPIs in contracts have the desired
   impact, procurement must tie them to the strategic objectives of the
   organization as a whole. When engaging a marketing agency, for example,
   one company identified specific metrics to gauge progress on strategic
   performance. These categories would then suggest a host of KPIs that
   reflect the scope of the agency’s work. The trick is to home in on the
   specific KPIs that will have a tangible impact on the company’s
   performance and attach the proper incentives for the agency to meet or
   exceed these targets.

   In this case, the company identified an increase in customer
   consideration of its products or services as a KPI directly related to
   its overall marketing objectives and offered the agency a potential
   markup of 6 percent for progress in this area. Other measures of brand
   equity and market awareness were selected in a similar manner.
   Typically, agencies will want to earn about 12 percent guaranteed
   markup, but this percentage can be negotiated. By tying markups to
   specific performance targets and offering an upside for
   overperformance, a mutually beneficial performance partnership was
   created. In all, the marketing agency stood to earn an incentive of 18
   percent on its services for exceeding targets (exhibit).

   Contracting for performance includes specific, measurable performance
   improvement targets as well as incentives (for shared rewards) or
   liabilities (for damages based on performance against targets). For the
   four main areas of contract terms—TCO, reliability, quality, and
   innovation—companies should be sure to define corresponding KPIs. If a
   contract includes pricing terms based on annual price reductions and
   supplier pricing competitiveness, for example, KPIs could include the
   percentage of a price decrease or proximity to the lowest price in the
   market. Documentation of the process and cadence to measure these KPIs
   and determine performance-based pay should be clearly spelled out. (For
   more detail on KPIs, see sidebar, “Aligning KPIs to strategic
   objectives.”)

Contract implementation and ongoing vendor management

   Process and workflow gaps between the contracting and the
   implementation teams (for example, a lack of transparency between
   procurement and legal) can lead to missed opportunities on contract
   implementation and execution. After an arduous process to draft and
   execute the contract, companies often fail to review and enforce terms
   on a regular basis. In addition, inflexible contracts make
   forward-looking vendor performance management difficult—instead of
   addressing root causes of performance issues, contracting partners
   blame each other. Further, without a basic level of collaboration,
   procurement will not have access to data and analytics that could
   manage vendor performance more effectively.

   Vendor management is not a solitary, arbitrary, or one-off process.
   Instead, companies must commit to regular monitoring of contract
   performance against clearly defined targets. The focus should be on
   measuring total costs as well as supplier performance. If a supplier is
   underperforming, the customer must enforce a penalty, with repeated
   underperformance drawing increasing fines. Regular monitoring,
   communication, and corrective action are vital to ensuring contract
   performance, so companies must also commit the resources from the
   procurement organization and vendor to regularly complete that formal
   review process. This setup also enables the client to continually
   optimize the relationship—within as well as potentially beyond the
   contract scope.

   One hospital system, for example, laid out incentives and penalties for
   vendor performance on specific services. In housekeeping, the hospital
   uses several metrics including the employee turnover and room
   turnaround times. To get a more complete picture of the quality of
   housekeeping, the hospital also used a patient satisfaction survey,
   with specific incentives tied to positive patient scores (Exhibit 2).
   The combination of metrics enabled the hospital to focus on the KPIs
   that had a tangible impact on operations.

Shifting the organization to contracting for performance

   Adopting the best practices discussed above will likely require
   procurement leaders to reevaluate their function’s approach to
   contracting. The goal should be to put the processes in place so that
   procurement can handle every contract in a consistent manner. Although
   setting up a contracting-for-performance culture may seem like a
   daunting and lengthy task, organizations can take actions to
   incrementally enhance their suppliers’ performance. Several initial
   steps can help to build momentum for a sustained effort.

   Implement standard contract reviews and benchmarking practices. Greater
   visibility into existing contracts can enable the organization to write
   better contracts going forward. A semiautomated, basic screening
   process involves scanning contracts for keywords and phrases related to
   performance, value, and selected cost drivers. The aggregated findings
   are reviewed and validated by sourcing managers and local teams. Legal
   then verifies the analysis and conclusions of the review teams. The
   output of this process is a fact base that procurement can use to
   support focused negotiations with selected suppliers.
   Driving superior value through digital procurement

   One company, for example, had retained a technology provider to
   customize its off-the-shelf product with specific features and
   functionality. The contract clearly linked all payments and incentives
   to the delivery of very specific outcomes, so when the technology
   provider proved incapable of tailoring its product in the defined ways,
   the company was able to claw back all payments, including all internal
   costs associated with the provider’s nonperformance.

   Differentiate contracting needs by category, spending levels, vendor
   relationships, and risk. Prior to writing the contract for a specific
   vendor agreement, procurement should collaborate with legal to create a
   standard checklist and language that reflect the requirements of both
   procurement and legal. This standard list should then be reviewed with
   the business partner in each contracting situation and adjusted to the
   specific business goals. When contracting with specific vendors, it is
   beneficial to write the contract and then request redline markups from
   vendors, since starting with their language could make it more
   difficult to negotiate. In parallel with writing the contract or
   editing legal’s initial or standard template, procurement should
   formulate an approach to manage supplier performance.

   To determine performance incentives, for example, procurement could use
   a three-tiered, contracting-for-performance approach based on spending
   levels (Exhibit 3). All contracts would start with basic terms and
   conditions for performance that serve as a minimum requirement for all
   suppliers and include penalties for substandard performance. The next
   tier, for major suppliers, would be a performance-based contract that
   includes a handful of KPIs to more specifically gauge performance. For
   large spending categories that are critical to the organization’s
   success, a more extensive list of KPIs would be used to support
   continuous improvement efforts. While this type of contract requires
   substantial resources to develop and monitor, the size of the spend
   categories and potential savings more than justifies this level of
   involvement.

   Collaborate to increase coordination and transparency. Since
   coordinating the efforts of procurement and legal, among other
   stakeholders, is often a struggle, the contracting process can be used
   as a catalyst to define the collaborative relationship across all
   stakeholders. Setting up an integrated contracting, implementation, and
   vendor management organization that creates a strong feedback loop for
   the next contract negotiation can enable procurement and legal to work
   hand in hand. Further, procurement should establish a contract
   governance process that focuses on improving buyer-supplier
   relationships by using performance data and analytics to take
   corrective action at the first offense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Applying contracting for performance across the entire process can
   position procurement organizations to extract more value from their
   vendors and suppliers. The close alignment of procurement with other
   functions can support increased performance and continuous improvement
   efforts. Such closely coordinated monitoring and vendor management can
   also significantly reduce downstream costs such as cost overruns,
   scheduling delays, and poor quality.

   A good place to start is to focus on performance requirements linked to
   clear objectives and quantitative metrics. A more ambitious program
   will likely require procurement to build additional capabilities, such
   as adding contract specialists; establishing standing, cross-functional
   teams; and implementing contract management and analytics software.
   Given the size of the potential cost savings, procurement leaders
   cannot ignore the opportunity.

   Even as pressures mount on brick-and-mortar stores, retailers can find
   growth by focusing on the battlegrounds that are still up for grabs.

   For years now, hand-wringing executives in the retail sector, nervously
   eyeing Amazon, have been able to point to their own retail stores as
   potential strategic weapons. For all the well-documented challenges and
   economic pressures of managing brick-and-mortar locations, shopping
   trends and consumer spend still favored the store. After all, some 80
   percent of purchases are expected to still happen in stores in 2020.^1

   With Amazon’s well-publicized purchase of Whole Foods, the refuge of an
   omnichannel strategy anchored on physical stores has evaporated. Let’s
   be clear, though. The real news isn’t that Amazon is buying a physical
   chain of stores. Taken with the retailer’s other recent developments,
   such as Prime Wardrobe, which allows people to try and return clothing
   for free, the real story is Amazon’s systematic approach to whittling
   away at what makes a store a store.

   While omnichannel is evaporating as a strategic advantage for stores, a
   careful review of what stores offer consumers shows that there are
   plenty of areas where stores can still compete and win.

The steady deterioration of the value proposition offered by ‘stores’

   There are specific reasons why customers go to a store—seven of them,
   to be precise (see exhibit). While Amazon consistently grabs headlines
   with its bold moves, a range of smaller start-ups are redefining the
   retail experience by innovating delivery, sharing, and curation. That
   means successful retail in the digital age isn’t just about “how to
   respond to Amazon” but more about how to stay on top and ahead of the
   wave of innovations hitting retailers.

   The announcement of Kohl’s and Amazon’s partnership in September is an
   example of how stores are responding. Kohl’s is looking for a way to
   use the tailwinds of e-commerce and Amazon to continue to drive traffic
   to brick and mortar.

   Shining a light on each of the elements of the in-store value
   proposition is necessary to understand what the battlegrounds really
   are. By being methodical in evaluating the remaining battlegrounds and
   being clear what the value of each is to consumers, retailers can
   develop a thoughtful strategy that embraces parity in some areas while
   shifting activities to others where they can still win.

What’s a retailer to do?

   To have a chance to thrive in an increasingly pressurized environment,
   retailers need to build up specific capabilities. They include
   upgrading their technology infrastructure to support more innovation
   and embracing an agile, test-and-learn culture. In many cases, they’ll
   need to partner with vendors and businesses to build new capabilities
   and access new markets.

   But when it comes to the value proposition of the store itself, there
   are three actions retailers can take:

   1. Focus on making stores work. With the vast majority of shopping
   still happening in stores for the foreseeable future, businesses need
   to focus on continually optimizing their stores’ efficiency. This
   should include analyzing in-store customer experience to identify what
   associate actions drive engagement and conversion, and focusing on data
   collection from store visits (e.g., email collection and link to
   digital relationship for in-store visitors). Apple and Sephora, for
   example, serve relevant communications and offers based on where a
   customer is in a store and when they enter. Best Buy has invested in
   more training for sales staff, employee-discount programs to retain
   talent, and improvements to its internal search engine so that
   salespeople can help customers get the information they need more
   quickly. Working in conjunction with retailers to use analytics to
   optimize trade and promotions is a particularly valuable area to focus
   on, since only one third of T&P spend generates a positive ROI.
   Executives need to also re-examine their collective store footprint,
   particularly focusing on which markets are actually delivering growth.
   That means having a much more granular understanding of markets, such
   as focusing on cities rather than regions. For apparel, for example, 15
   of the top 20 cities with the highest growth are in emerging markets.^2
   2. McKinsey analysis. This granular approach to stores should be taken
   for both rationalization/closures and new openings.

   2. Differentiate your offering. When it comes to choice, Amazon has an
   advantage that seems virtually unassailable (372 million products^3 3.
   Number of Products Sold on Amazon.com ScrapeHero, June 2017.).
   Companies have had success by differentiating their products so a
   shopper can’t compare them to, and then buy them from, Amazon. Costco,
   for example, has had success in competing on value and breadth of
   product choices with its big-box format. Other department stores have
   invested in stocking unique brands or products that just aren’t
   available elsewhere. The most effective differentiation strategies,
   however, are grounded in a deep understanding of customer needs, the
   lifetime value of customers at a granular and behavioral level, and the
   retailers’ own strategy. Nike, for example, has a clear focus on its
   most important customer segments from product development to their
   digital-asset development, e.g. apps geared towards runners or sneaker
   heads.

   3. Double down on the open battlegrounds of the value proposition. For
   all the progress Amazon has made, there are still a number of areas
   where it doesn’t have a chokehold. A number of companies have already
   made significant inroads in preserving and capitalizing on these
   elements.
     * Product vetting/touch & feel. While Amazon’s purchase of Whole
       Foods and its recently launched Prime Wardrobe have created
       significant pressure on this element of the store’s value
       proposition, this space is still unclaimed. Product showrooms let
       shoppers try and experience the product, while pop-up stores in
       shopping malls can offer distinctive products for a short period of
       time. In the United Kingdom, for example, pop-ups accounted for
       £2.3 billion in sales in 2015, up 12 percent over the previous
       year.^4 4. Sangeeth Ram, “Meeting millennials where they shop:
       Shaping the future of shopping malls,” January 2017, McKinsey.com.
       Sephora hosts in-store events where customers can try and learn how
       to work with new product and beauty trends; the current
       Monochromatic Makeup trend, for example, was bolstered by events
       where customers could try products, across stores in New York City,
       San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago.
     * Consultation, advice, authority. While ratings and reviews have
       provided consumers with some guidance in product selection, they
       still fall far short of speaking in person with an expert. For DIY,
       Lowe's and Home Depot have trained associates to be reliable
       experts. They also offer numerous how-to classes that provide
       shoppers with valuable information. Nordstrom, a company with a
       heritage of customer service, is also continuing to deepen the role
       of the personal shopper and stylist advice across categories such
       as beauty and wedding as well as through store-to-digital offerings
       like TextStyle. In the beauty category, Sephora has become an
       accepted source of objective and trusted advice across a broad
       assortment of best-selling and newly released beauty brands.
     * Experience and community. Strengthening relationships with
       customers has, of course, always been an important element of
       retail. But retailers have become more creative in how they do that
       through the store. The notion of “retail as theater,” i.e., a
       source of entertainment and experience, has found new relevance
       through Apple and Tesla, which have created cachet around the store
       experience. Nordstrom Local, a recent initiative from the upscale
       retailer, has launched new experiences, including an in-store bar
       with wine, beer, coffee, and juices; eight fitting rooms;
       alterations; convenient merchandise pickups and returns; manicures;
       and expert image consultations with its knowledgeable personal
       stylists. The Local aspires to become a physical manifestation of
       the Nordstrom brand. Lululemon has taken another approach by
       offering a breadth of events such as yoga classes and run meet-ups.
       They engage local yogi, fitness instructors, personal trainers, and
       professional athletes as "brand ambassadors" and encourage them to
       both offer free classes and participate in programs such as
       “Purpose and Practice” to create deeper community connections.

   There is no doubt that Amazon and other retail innovators continue to
   make it difficult for the traditional retailer. To compete and thrive,
   however, is possible, if companies clearly articulate a committed
   strategy based on the in-store value proposition.

   Rapport

Quel avenir pour le modèle coopératif agricole français ?

   juillet 2019 – Maillons historiques et centraux du paysage agricole
   français, les coopératives sont aujourd’hui confrontées à une
   concurrence inédite liée aux disruptions radicales à l’œuvre dans le
   secteur (exploitation des technologies de pointe, émergence de nouveaux
   acteurs digitaux, bouleversement des modes de consommation…). En
   particulier, les évolutions réglementaires récentes affectant les
   activités de distribution et de conseil en matière d’intrants
   phytosanitaires viennent bousculer l’équation économique de bon nombre
   d’entre elles. Dès lors, ajuster les composantes de leur modèle
   économique et clarifier la proposition de valeur pour leurs adhérents
   s’imposent pour les coopératives comme une priorité.
   Rapport

La confiance à l’épreuve des grandes mutations économiques

   juillet 2019 – La confiance sous-tend l’investissement des entreprises,
   la consommation des ménages et plus largement, toute action... publique
   et les fondements du pacte social. À ce titre, sa chute lors de la
   crise de 2007-2008, et son difficile rétablissement depuis, constituent
   un facteur aggravant l’incertitude avec laquelle doivent composer les
   dirigeants.
   Rapport

10 enjeux cruciaux pour la France à l’horizon 2022

   avril 2017 – Entrée en vigueur du Brexit, échéances électorales
   nationales, divergence des trajectoires de croissance... au sein de
   l’Europe... Au cours des cinq prochaines années, la France s’engage
   dans une période charnière qu’elle ne saurait aborder sans avoir réduit
   plusieurs fragilités ou déséquilibres structurels de son économie. Le
   McKinsey Global Institute identifie dix enjeux cruciaux pour le pays à
   l’horizon 2022, les menaces ou opportunités qu’ils recèlent et les
   principaux leviers qu’ils imposent d’actionner.
   Rapport

Women and the future of work: A window of opportunity in Western Europe?

   novembre 2018 – La nouvelle édition de l’étude Women Matter, « Women
   and The Future of Work : A Window of Opportunity... in Western Europe ?
   » modélise l’impact des ruptures technologiques sur la parité
   femmes-hommes, au sein du futur marché du travail en France et en
   Allemagne.
   Rapport - McKinsey Global Institute

Digital Europe: Realizing the continent's potential

   juin 2016 – Malgré d'indéniables avancées sur le front du digital,
   l'Europe ne concrétise pour l’heure que 12% de son potentiel
   numérique,... contre 18% pour les Etats-Unis.

Delivering through diversity - New in 2018

   Our latest research analyzes more data from more companies than ever
   before. Three years on, does the link between company financial
   performance and ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity stand up to
   greater scrutiny? Learn the answer and how leading companies are
   creating inclusion strategies that work.

   We know intuitively that diversity matters. It’s also increasingly
   clear that it makes sense in purely business terms. Our latest research
   finds that companies in the top quartile for gender or racial and
   ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial returns above their
   national industry medians. Companies in the bottom quartile in these
   dimensions are statistically less likely to achieve above-average
   returns. And diversity is probably a competitive differentiator that
   shifts market share toward more diverse companies over time.

   While correlation does not equal causation (greater gender and ethnic
   diversity in corporate leadership doesn’t automatically translate into
   more profit), the correlation does indicate that when companies commit
   themselves to diverse leadership, they are more successful. More
   diverse companies, we believe, are better able to win top talent and
   improve their customer orientation, employee satisfaction, and decision
   making, and all that leads to a virtuous cycle of increasing returns.
   This in turn suggests that other kinds of diversity—for example, in
   age, sexual orientation, and experience (such as a global mind-set and
   cultural fluency)—are also likely to bring some level of competitive
   advantage for companies that can attract and retain such diverse
   talent.

   McKinsey has been examining diversity in the workplace for several
   years. Our latest report, Diversity Matters, examined proprietary data
   sets for 366 public companies across a range of industries in Canada,
   Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this
   research, we looked at metrics such as financial results and the
   composition of top management and boards.^1 1. The Women Matter
   research McKinsey published in 2007 identified a positive relationship
   between corporate performance and gender diversity. We have since
   expanded the focus of this research to examine diversity more broadly,
   from gender to race and ethnicity to sexual orientation. Our latest
   research examined metrics such as total revenues, earnings before
   interest and taxes, and returns on equity for the years 2010 to 2013.
   In addition to capturing gender information, the data set included
   information on ethnicity, race, or both from publicly available
   sources. For a detailed explanation of how we conducted our research,
   please see our full report, Diversity Matters (PDF–946KB). The findings
   were clear:
     * Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are
       35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their
       respective national industry medians.
     * Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent
       more likely to have financial returns above their respective
       national industry medians.
     * Companies in the bottom quartile both for gender and for ethnicity
       and race are statistically less likely to achieve above-average
       financial returns than the average companies in the data set (that
       is, bottom-quartile companies are lagging rather than merely not
       leading).
     * In the United States, there is a linear relationship between racial
       and ethnic diversity and better financial performance: for every 10
       percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the
       senior-executive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
       rise 0.8 percent.
     * Racial and ethnic diversity has a stronger impact on financial
       performance in the United States than gender diversity, perhaps
       because earlier efforts to increase women’s representation in the
       top levels of business have already yielded positive results.
     * In the United Kingdom, greater gender diversity on the
       senior-executive team corresponded to the highest performance
       uplift in our data set: for every 10 percent increase in gender
       diversity, EBIT rose by 3.5 percent.
     * While certain industries perform better on gender diversity and
       other industries on ethnic and racial diversity, no industry or
       company is in the top quartile on both dimensions.
     * The unequal performance of companies in the same industry and the
       same country implies that diversity is a competitive differentiator
       shifting market share toward more diverse companies.

   We’re not suggesting that achieving greater diversity is easy.
   Women—accounting for an average of just 16 percent of the members of
   executive teams in the United States, 12 percent in the United Kingdom,
   and 6 percent in Brazil—remain underrepresented at the top of
   corporations globally. The United Kingdom does comparatively better in
   racial diversity, albeit at a low level: some 78 percent of UK
   companies have senior-leadership teams that fail to reflect the
   demographic composition of the country’s labor force and population,
   compared with 91 percent for Brazil and 97 percent for the United
   States.

   These numbers underline the work that remains to be done, even as the
   case for greater diversity becomes more compelling. We live in a deeply
   connected and global world. It should come as no surprise that more
   diverse companies and institutions are achieving better performance.
   Most organizations, including McKinsey, must do more to take full
   advantage of the opportunity that diverse leadership teams represent.
   That’s particularly true for their talent pipelines: attracting,
   developing, mentoring, sponsoring, and retaining the next generations
   of global leaders at all levels of organizations. Given the higher
   returns that diversity is expected to bring, we believe it is better to
   invest now, since winners will pull further ahead and laggards will
   fall further behind.

   The majority of contracts are lacking basic elements that could enable
   better vendor performance and cost savings. Here’s how companies can
   tighten the rein.

   Most industries have a large majority of their spending locked in
   contracts: companies in utilities, aerospace and defense, and food
   manufacturing can have 90 percent or more of their annual revenues
   represented in contracts with suppliers and vendors. Despite this
   outsized share, the majority of organizations invest relatively limited
   resources in contract development and vendor management. In fact,
   across industries, total procurement operating expenses are typically
   less than 1 percent of total spending.^1 1. “5 common references for
   procurement benchmarking,” Purchasing & Procurement Center, accessed
   January 5, 2018, purchasing-procurement-center.com. By underinvesting
   in this way, companies are overlooking a significant source of value:
   suboptimal contract terms and conditions combined with a lack of
   effective contract management can cause an erosion of value in sourcing
   equal to 9 percent of annual revenues. For Fortune’s 2016 Global 500
   companies, this 9 percent would have equaled $2.5 trillion in value. ^2

   Several factors contribute to this lack of oversight and contract
   management: large procurement functions execute and monitor tens of
   thousands of contracts annually, on average, so the sheer volume can be
   overwhelming. Lack of procurement resources or ownership tends to shift
   contractor management to the users in the functions requiring the
   product or service who are usually not trained to do it effectively. In
   addition, 80 percent of procurement functions are not fully aware of
   competitive terms and contract structure.^3 3.2015 IACCM Benchmarking
   Study, PWC. Since contracts establish the “rules of the game” for the
   supplier relationship, they are a critical factor in generating value,
   particularly for services. Without a point of reference for what good
   looks like, bringing contracts in line with industry standards is not
   possible. Last, procurement often takes a narrow view of business value
   in setting terms and conditions, meaning that significant enablers for
   future value creation from demand, operations, contract management, or
   supply chain are often not incorporated into the contracts. All of
   these factors limit a company’s ability to get better performance from
   their suppliers and vendors.

   To determine specific contract areas where companies are falling short,
   McKinsey conducted research that examined every facet of contract
   development and execution and found that companies face challenges in
   three parts of the contracting process—precontracting, contract
   writing, and implementation and vendor management. In our experience,
   the key to optimizing the entire process is an approach called
   contracting for performance—a formal agreement with a supplier that
   sets specific rewards and penalties for achieving, or failing to
   achieve, performance levels that affect the bottom line. As a first
   step, companies must recognize the common pitfalls to writing and
   executing contracts as well as the essential elements of effective
   contracts. Next, executives should seek to implement strategies that
   support more effective engagement in the precontracting, contract
   writing, and implementation and management phases. These actions can
   enable procurement organizations to build the capabilities and
   expertise to write contracts that deliver better performance.

The state of contracting

   Over the past year, McKinsey’s Rapid Procurement Contract Insights
   (RPCI) service line has reviewed more than 100 contracts against a
   comprehensive assessment grid of more than 60 criteria. This analysis
   revealed that the majority of procurement contracts fall well short on
   a range of basic contract elements related to performance. In general,
   contracts for indirect spending in our sample tended to be written more
   effectively than those for direct spending, but no particular industry
   or spending category outperformed others consistently. As most reviewed
   contracts represented some of the top-spending categories, it was more
   likely that the indirect spending contracts were centrally managed and
   therefore might have received greater scrutiny at the time of
   completion than their direct spending counterparts. For direct
   spending, we have observed that a lot of emphasis on getting the right
   product to the right place at the right time, so contracts tend to be
   more robust on product specifications and delivery terms as opposed to
   total cost of ownership. More specifically, our analysis assessed
   contracts across three dimensions:

1. General terms and conditions

   More than 75 percent of contracts in our sample did not include an
   exhaustive set of key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting
   processes linked to total cost of ownership. Procurement professionals
   cite various reasons for contract gaps with regard to KPIs and
   reporting. At the performance-measurement level, many professionals do
   not have the category expertise to measure overall vendor performance
   in a given category or effectively quantify how vendor performance
   affects costs. Others are unable to define easily measured KPIs or lack
   the capabilities and resources to track supplier performance. Still
   others believe their organization can’t effectively negotiate
   performance KPIs with their suppliers, instead accepting vendor terms.
   Of the remaining 25 percent, contracts for indirect spending categories
   were more likely to have exhaustive sets of KPIs and reporting
   mechanisms included compared with contracts in direct spending
   categories. For direct spending, procurement professionals often assume
   that quality and performance are static requirements that should be
   evaluated on a pass-fail basis.

   In addition, clauses that define rules for subcontracting were absent
   in one-quarter of the sample. Contracts related to direct categories
   had subcontracting rules that were more poorly defined, on average,
   compared with those in contracts for indirect categories. This effect
   can be explained in part by the fact that more direct spending
   contracts are supply contracts, whereas indirect spending contracts
   more often require vendors to perform services at a client’s site. When
   third-party personnel gain access to client sites, the risks that come
   with subcontracting increase. But for direct contracts, the supplier is
   mistakenly often not seen as a potential risk.

2. Commercial terms and conditions

   In our sample, eight out of every ten contracts did not contain any
   form of a benchmarking clause, which mandates a periodic review of
   pricing against industry standards or relevant indices to ensure that
   vendors and suppliers are charging prices in line with fair and
   reasonable market rates. Since a benchmarking clause would allow for
   much stronger cost controls, we regularly find opportunities for
   procurement to improve contracts in this regard. But all too often,
   benchmarking clauses feature generic language that allows the buyer to
   benchmark prices at similar companies only. A bottom-up cost
   benchmarking potentially linked to a “should cost” based understanding
   of supplier economics would be much more effective to determine
   additional opportunities to capture value.

   Similarly, clauses that cap pricing adjustments for inflation were not
   included in nearly 40 percent of contracts. Indirect spending
   categories were twice as likely to have contracts with some form of
   inflation adjustment clause compared with contracts for direct
   categories. This omission is relevant for several reasons. Inflation
   rates are calculated based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) measurements.
   According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI typically
   measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
   consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.”
   Depending on the specific product or service that a supplier may
   provide to a customer, the direct relationship of this good (or of some
   share of its cost) to a general basket of consumer goods and services
   is certainly questionable.

3. Partnership and governance conditions

   A critical lever in generating more value from contracts is partnership
   and governance conditions, which enable closer collaboration and
   contract governance between buyers and suppliers. Despite its
   importance, our analysis uncovered some key gaps: in almost 20 percent
   of cases, contracts did not contain any process definitions for
   continuous improvements. What’s more, half of all contracts we reviewed
   did not include clauses related to the establishment of governance
   bodies and escalation paths to manage contract life cycles. Many
   contracts include only very vague contract language stating that, for
   example, “the parties will work together on continuous improvement
   efforts.” Such language does not specify responsibility for achieving
   goals nor any details on how any of the tasks would be tracked,
   reviewed, or implemented.

   An examination of the impact of these contracting gaps reinforces the
   value at stake: poor supplier performance can result in higher total
   costs of 10 to 20 percent in the contracted category (Exhibit 1). When
   suppliers fall short, it can result in shadow or downstream costs that
   lie beyond the view of procurement when negotiating the initial
   purchase price and contract terms that do not incorporate a life cycle
   total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective. For example, one industrial
   manufacturing company experienced significant rework in some commodity
   segments, resulting in additional costs equal to 30 to 50 percent of
   revenues. Late deliveries can have a knock-on effect, requiring
   manufacturers to pay additional overtime or credit customers for
   delays.

Contracting for performance

   The myriad variables involved in negotiating, writing, and enforcing
   contracts means that incremental efforts to improve vendor performance
   will likely fail to capture significant value. Instead, a comprehensive
   approach to the contracting process and project delivery is required.
   Contracting for performance can help reduce costs and achieve value
   beyond the contract’s original scope by shifting responsibility from
   buyer to supplier and specifying deliverables, performance monitoring,
   and management processes. These contracts define metrics and acceptable
   quality levels as part of the scope of work and establish a clear
   governance structure for reporting and monitoring continuous
   improvement. The distinctive advantage of performance-based contracts
   is that operational efficiencies are guaranteed by the supplier. Such
   assurance comes from not only the inclusion of performance metrics,
   penalties, and monitoring but also performance incentives and
   gain-share mechanisms that are typically common in partnerships.

   When seeking to improve contract writing and vendor management, it can
   be instructive to segment the contract process into three
   phases—precontracting, contract writing, and implementation and
   management. In our experience, procurement organizations face a range
   of challenges in these areas, and contracting for performance can
   directly address them.

Precontracting

   During the initial development of contracts, negotiations often fail to
   address all relevant aspects for contracting, implementation, and
   ongoing vendor management for a variety of reasons. Legal, contracting
   teams, and other stakeholders may not be involved early enough in
   contract negotiations or are not sufficiently engaged throughout the
   process. In some instances, a lack of time and resources can impede
   sufficient preparation among procurement, legal, and the business. In
   others, an overemphasis during negotiations on how responsibility and
   value will be divided can lead to lengthy, antagonistic negotiations
   that alienate the contracting parties and lead to a similarly lengthy
   and antagonistic vendor management process.

   Companies that adopt contracting for performance can empower functions
   and stakeholders to clearly define priorities and performance targets.
   By getting all relevant parties involved at the outset of the process,
   procurement can start with a comprehensive perspective on TCO and value
   creation. Contract negotiations can then start by creating a shared
   vision or statement of intent that can be used as a basis to regularly
   revisit and emphasize integrative issues. Integrative issues are
   opportunities to expand the value for both sides (“win-win”) or where
   the interests of both sides are aligned. An example of an integrative
   issue is the length of contract: it costs the buyer nothing (if
   properly written) and adds tremendous value to the supplier. Achieving
   consensus also facilitates other important tasks that can keep the
   contract on track throughout the process:
     * Articulate scope of services with commercial and legal terms while
       removing ambiguity
     * Ensure value capture is addressed and translated to the contracting
       priorities across all TCO levers over the expected life cycle of
       the product or service
     * Develop a perspective on the main cost drivers of the product or
       service, and verify any adjustments or escalation clauses are
       linked to the right baseline cost elements
     * Define performance based on mutually agreed upon targets
     * Develop an appropriate reward and penalty structure for vendors
       (and potentially also the buyer) to encourage the expected
       performance
     * Commit resources from the organization and suppliers to engage in a
       formal review process

Contract writing

   The task of writing contracts is obviously affected, and sometimes
   complicated, by the results of the precontracting phase. When
   negotiation results are handed to legal with the direction to “just
   formalize the contract,” the final document can consist of legal
   contract language that may be difficult for other stakeholders to
   understand and use to manage the vendor. Further, procurement may
   emphasize certain performance levels during the formulation of the
   contract that are not in alignment with business goals. Last, tight
   timelines can also produce contracts that are prepared in a rush
   without adequate consideration from relevant parties. To save time, for
   example, companies might opt to use a vendor template. All of these
   factors can undermine efforts to define vendor performance levels.

   Aligning KPIs to strategic objectives

   To ensure that performance-based KPIs in contracts have the desired
   impact, procurement must tie them to the strategic objectives of the
   organization as a whole. When engaging a marketing agency, for example,
   one company identified specific metrics to gauge progress on strategic
   performance. These categories would then suggest a host of KPIs that
   reflect the scope of the agency’s work. The trick is to home in on the
   specific KPIs that will have a tangible impact on the company’s
   performance and attach the proper incentives for the agency to meet or
   exceed these targets.

   In this case, the company identified an increase in customer
   consideration of its products or services as a KPI directly related to
   its overall marketing objectives and offered the agency a potential
   markup of 6 percent for progress in this area. Other measures of brand
   equity and market awareness were selected in a similar manner.
   Typically, agencies will want to earn about 12 percent guaranteed
   markup, but this percentage can be negotiated. By tying markups to
   specific performance targets and offering an upside for
   overperformance, a mutually beneficial performance partnership was
   created. In all, the marketing agency stood to earn an incentive of 18
   percent on its services for exceeding targets (exhibit).

   Contracting for performance includes specific, measurable performance
   improvement targets as well as incentives (for shared rewards) or
   liabilities (for damages based on performance against targets). For the
   four main areas of contract terms—TCO, reliability, quality, and
   innovation—companies should be sure to define corresponding KPIs. If a
   contract includes pricing terms based on annual price reductions and
   supplier pricing competitiveness, for example, KPIs could include the
   percentage of a price decrease or proximity to the lowest price in the
   market. Documentation of the process and cadence to measure these KPIs
   and determine performance-based pay should be clearly spelled out. (For
   more detail on KPIs, see sidebar, “Aligning KPIs to strategic
   objectives.”)

Contract implementation and ongoing vendor management

   Process and workflow gaps between the contracting and the
   implementation teams (for example, a lack of transparency between
   procurement and legal) can lead to missed opportunities on contract
   implementation and execution. After an arduous process to draft and
   execute the contract, companies often fail to review and enforce terms
   on a regular basis. In addition, inflexible contracts make
   forward-looking vendor performance management difficult—instead of
   addressing root causes of performance issues, contracting partners
   blame each other. Further, without a basic level of collaboration,
   procurement will not have access to data and analytics that could
   manage vendor performance more effectively.

   Vendor management is not a solitary, arbitrary, or one-off process.
   Instead, companies must commit to regular monitoring of contract
   performance against clearly defined targets. The focus should be on
   measuring total costs as well as supplier performance. If a supplier is
   underperforming, the customer must enforce a penalty, with repeated
   underperformance drawing increasing fines. Regular monitoring,
   communication, and corrective action are vital to ensuring contract
   performance, so companies must also commit the resources from the
   procurement organization and vendor to regularly complete that formal
   review process. This setup also enables the client to continually
   optimize the relationship—within as well as potentially beyond the
   contract scope.

   One hospital system, for example, laid out incentives and penalties for
   vendor performance on specific services. In housekeeping, the hospital
   uses several metrics including the employee turnover and room
   turnaround times. To get a more complete picture of the quality of
   housekeeping, the hospital also used a patient satisfaction survey,
   with specific incentives tied to positive patient scores (Exhibit 2).
   The combination of metrics enabled the hospital to focus on the KPIs
   that had a tangible impact on operations.

Shifting the organization to contracting for performance

   Adopting the best practices discussed above will likely require
   procurement leaders to reevaluate their function’s approach to
   contracting. The goal should be to put the processes in place so that
   procurement can handle every contract in a consistent manner. Although
   setting up a contracting-for-performance culture may seem like a
   daunting and lengthy task, organizations can take actions to
   incrementally enhance their suppliers’ performance. Several initial
   steps can help to build momentum for a sustained effort.

   Implement standard contract reviews and benchmarking practices. Greater
   visibility into existing contracts can enable the organization to write
   better contracts going forward. A semiautomated, basic screening
   process involves scanning contracts for keywords and phrases related to
   performance, value, and selected cost drivers. The aggregated findings
   are reviewed and validated by sourcing managers and local teams. Legal
   then verifies the analysis and conclusions of the review teams. The
   output of this process is a fact base that procurement can use to
   support focused negotiations with selected suppliers.
   Driving superior value through digital procurement

   One company, for example, had retained a technology provider to
   customize its off-the-shelf product with specific features and
   functionality. The contract clearly linked all payments and incentives
   to the delivery of very specific outcomes, so when the technology
   provider proved incapable of tailoring its product in the defined ways,
   the company was able to claw back all payments, including all internal
   costs associated with the provider’s nonperformance.

   Differentiate contracting needs by category, spending levels, vendor
   relationships, and risk. Prior to writing the contract for a specific
   vendor agreement, procurement should collaborate with legal to create a
   standard checklist and language that reflect the requirements of both
   procurement and legal. This standard list should then be reviewed with
   the business partner in each contracting situation and adjusted to the
   specific business goals. When contracting with specific vendors, it is
   beneficial to write the contract and then request redline markups from
   vendors, since starting with their language could make it more
   difficult to negotiate. In parallel with writing the contract or
   editing legal’s initial or standard template, procurement should
   formulate an approach to manage supplier performance.

   To determine performance incentives, for example, procurement could use
   a three-tiered, contracting-for-performance approach based on spending
   levels (Exhibit 3). All contracts would start with basic terms and
   conditions for performance that serve as a minimum requirement for all
   suppliers and include penalties for substandard performance. The next
   tier, for major suppliers, would be a performance-based contract that
   includes a handful of KPIs to more specifically gauge performance. For
   large spending categories that are critical to the organization’s
   success, a more extensive list of KPIs would be used to support
   continuous improvement efforts. While this type of contract requires
   substantial resources to develop and monitor, the size of the spend
   categories and potential savings more than justifies this level of
   involvement.

   Collaborate to increase coordination and transparency. Since
   coordinating the efforts of procurement and legal, among other
   stakeholders, is often a struggle, the contracting process can be used
   as a catalyst to define the collaborative relationship across all
   stakeholders. Setting up an integrated contracting, implementation, and
   vendor management organization that creates a strong feedback loop for
   the next contract negotiation can enable procurement and legal to work
   hand in hand. Further, procurement should establish a contract
   governance process that focuses on improving buyer-supplier
   relationships by using performance data and analytics to take
   corrective action at the first offense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Applying contracting for performance across the entire process can
   position procurement organizations to extract more value from their
   vendors and suppliers. The close alignment of procurement with other
   functions can support increased performance and continuous improvement
   efforts. Such closely coordinated monitoring and vendor management can
   also significantly reduce downstream costs such as cost overruns,
   scheduling delays, and poor quality.

   A good place to start is to focus on performance requirements linked to
   clear objectives and quantitative metrics. A more ambitious program
   will likely require procurement to build additional capabilities, such
   as adding contract specialists; establishing standing, cross-functional
   teams; and implementing contract management and analytics software.
   Given the size of the potential cost savings, procurement leaders
   cannot ignore the opportunity.

   Even as pressures mount on brick-and-mortar stores, retailers can find
   growth by focusing on the battlegrounds that are still up for grabs.

   For years now, hand-wringing executives in the retail sector, nervously
   eyeing Amazon, have been able to point to their own retail stores as
   potential strategic weapons. For all the well-documented challenges and
   economic pressures of managing brick-and-mortar locations, shopping
   trends and consumer spend still favored the store. After all, some 80
   percent of purchases are expected to still happen in stores in 2020.^1

   Insight PCE projections, McKinsey analysis, 2015.

   With Amazon’s well-publicized purchase of Whole Foods, the refuge of an
   omnichannel strategy anchored on physical stores has evaporated. Let’s
   be clear, though. The real news isn’t that Amazon is buying a physical
   chain of stores. Taken with the retailer’s other recent developments,
   such as Prime Wardrobe, which allows people to try and return clothing
   for free, the real story is Amazon’s systematic approach to whittling
   away at what makes a store a store.

   While omnichannel is evaporating as a strategic advantage for stores, a
   careful review of what stores offer consumers shows that there are
   plenty of areas where stores can still compete and win.

The steady deterioration of the value proposition offered by ‘stores’

   There are specific reasons why customers go to a store—seven of them,
   to be precise (see exhibit). While Amazon consistently grabs headlines
   with its bold moves, a range of smaller start-ups are redefining the
   retail experience by innovating delivery, sharing, and curation. That
   means successful retail in the digital age isn’t just about “how to
   respond to Amazon” but more about how to stay on top and ahead of the
   wave of innovations hitting retailers.

   The announcement of Kohl’s and Amazon’s partnership in September is an
   example of how stores are responding. Kohl’s is looking for a way to
   use the tailwinds of e-commerce and Amazon to continue to drive traffic
   to brick and mortar.

   Shining a light on each of the elements of the in-store value
   proposition is necessary to understand what the battlegrounds really
   are. By being methodical in evaluating the remaining battlegrounds and
   being clear what the value of each is to consumers, retailers can
   develop a thoughtful strategy that embraces parity in some areas while
   shifting activities to others where they can still win.

What’s a retailer to do?

   To have a chance to thrive in an increasingly pressurized environment,
   retailers need to build up specific capabilities. They include
   upgrading their technology infrastructure to support more innovation
   and embracing an agile, test-and-learn culture. In many cases, they’ll
   need to partner with vendors and businesses to build new capabilities
   and access new markets.

   But when it comes to the value proposition of the store itself, there
   are three actions retailers can take:

   1. Focus on making stores work. With the vast majority of shopping
   still happening in stores for the foreseeable future, businesses need
   to focus on continually optimizing their stores’ efficiency. This
   should include analyzing in-store customer experience to identify what
   associate actions drive engagement and conversion, and focusing on data
   collection from store visits (e.g., email collection and link to
   digital relationship for in-store visitors). Apple and Sephora, for
   example, serve relevant communications and offers based on where a
   customer is in a store and when they enter. Best Buy has invested in
   more training for sales staff, employee-discount programs to retain
   talent, and improvements to its internal search engine so that
   salespeople can help customers get the information they need more
   quickly. Working in conjunction with retailers to use analytics to
   optimize trade and promotions is a particularly valuable area to focus
   on, since only one third of T&P spend generates a positive ROI.
   Executives need to also re-examine their collective store footprint,
   particularly focusing on which markets are actually delivering growth.
   That means having a much more granular understanding of markets, such
   as focusing on cities rather than regions. For apparel, for example, 15
   of the top 20 cities with the highest growth are in emerging markets.^2
   2. McKinsey analysis. This granular approach to stores should be taken
   for both rationalization/closures and new openings.

   2. Differentiate your offering. When it comes to choice, Amazon has an
   advantage that seems virtually unassailable (372 million products^3 3.
   Number of Products Sold on Amazon.com ScrapeHero, June 2017.).
   Companies have had success by differentiating their products so a
   shopper can’t compare them to, and then buy them from, Amazon. Costco,
   for example, has had success in competing on value and breadth of
   product choices with its big-box format. Other department stores have
   invested in stocking unique brands or products that just aren’t
   available elsewhere. The most effective differentiation strategies,
   however, are grounded in a deep understanding of customer needs, the
   lifetime value of customers at a granular and behavioral level, and the
   retailers’ own strategy. Nike, for example, has a clear focus on its
   most important customer segments from product development to their
   digital-asset development, e.g. apps geared towards runners or sneaker
   heads.

   3. Double down on the open battlegrounds of the value proposition. For
   all the progress Amazon has made, there are still a number of areas
   where it doesn’t have a chokehold. A number of companies have already
   made significant inroads in preserving and capitalizing on these
   elements.
     * Product vetting/touch & feel. While Amazon’s purchase of Whole
       Foods and its recently launched Prime Wardrobe have created
       significant pressure on this element of the store’s value
       proposition, this space is still unclaimed. Product showrooms let
       shoppers try and experience the product, while pop-up stores in
       shopping malls can offer distinctive products for a short period of
       time. In the United Kingdom, for example, pop-ups accounted for
       £2.3 billion in sales in 2015, up 12 percent over the previous
       year.^4 4. Sangeeth Ram, “Meeting millennials where they shop:
       Shaping the future of shopping malls,” January 2017, McKinsey.com.
       Sephora hosts in-store events where customers can try and learn how
       to work with new product and beauty trends; the current
       Monochromatic Makeup trend, for example, was bolstered by events
       where customers could try products, across stores in New York City,
       San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago.
     * Consultation, advice, authority. While ratings and reviews have
       provided consumers with some guidance in product selection, they
       still fall far short of speaking in person with an expert. For DIY,
       Lowe's and Home Depot have trained associates to be reliable
       experts. They also offer numerous how-to classes that provide
       shoppers with valuable information. Nordstrom, a company with a
       heritage of customer service, is also continuing to deepen the role
       of the personal shopper and stylist advice across categories such
       as beauty and wedding as well as through store-to-digital offerings
       like TextStyle. In the beauty category, Sephora has become an
       accepted source of objective and trusted advice across a broad
       assortment of best-selling and newly released beauty brands.
     * Experience and community. Strengthening relationships with
       customers has, of course, always been an important element of
       retail. But retailers have become more creative in how they do that
       through the store. The notion of “retail as theater,” i.e., a
       source of entertainment and experience, has found new relevance
       through Apple and Tesla, which have created cachet around the store
       experience. Nordstrom Local, a recent initiative from the upscale
       retailer, has launched new experiences, including an in-store bar
       with wine, beer, coffee, and juices; eight fitting rooms;
       alterations; convenient merchandise pickups and returns; manicures;
       and expert image consultations with its knowledgeable personal
       stylists. The Local aspires to become a physical manifestation of
       the Nordstrom brand. Lululemon has taken another approach by
       offering a breadth of events such as yoga classes and run meet-ups.
       They engage local yogi, fitness instructors, personal trainers, and
       professional athletes as "brand ambassadors" and encourage them to
       both offer free classes and participate in programs such as
       “Purpose and Practice” to create deeper community connections.

   There is no doubt that Amazon and other retail innovators continue to
   make it difficult for the traditional retailer. To compete and thrive,
   however, is possible, if companies clearly articulate a committed
   strategy based on the in-store value proposition.

Delivering through diversity - New in 2018

   Our latest research analyzes more data from more companies than ever
   before. Three years on, does the link between company financial
   performance and ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity stand up to
   greater scrutiny? Learn the answer and how leading companies are
   creating inclusion strategies that work.

   We know intuitively that diversity matters. It’s also increasingly
   clear that it makes sense in purely business terms. Our latest research
   finds that companies in the top quartile for gender or racial and
   ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial returns above their
   national industry medians. Companies in the bottom quartile in these
   dimensions are statistically less likely to achieve above-average
   returns. And diversity is probably a competitive differentiator that
   shifts market share toward more diverse companies over time.

   While correlation does not equal causation (greater gender and ethnic
   diversity in corporate leadership doesn’t automatically translate into
   more profit), the correlation does indicate that when companies commit
   themselves to diverse leadership, they are more successful. More
   diverse companies, we believe, are better able to win top talent and
   improve their customer orientation, employee satisfaction, and decision
   making, and all that leads to a virtuous cycle of increasing returns.
   This in turn suggests that other kinds of diversity—for example, in
   age, sexual orientation, and experience (such as a global mind-set and
   cultural fluency)—are also likely to bring some level of competitive
   advantage for companies that can attract and retain such diverse
   talent.

   McKinsey has been examining diversity in the workplace for several
   years. Our latest report, Diversity Matters, examined proprietary data
   sets for 366 public companies across a range of industries in Canada,
   Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this
   research, we looked at metrics such as financial results and the
   composition of top management and boards.^1 1. The Women Matter
   research McKinsey published in 2007 identified a positive relationship
   between corporate performance and gender diversity. We have since
   expanded the focus of this research to examine diversity more broadly,
   from gender to race and ethnicity to sexual orientation. Our latest
   research examined metrics such as total revenues, earnings before
   interest and taxes, and returns on equity for the years 2010 to 2013.
   In addition to capturing gender information, the data set included
   information on ethnicity, race, or both from publicly available
   sources. For a detailed explanation of how we conducted our research,
   please see our full report, Diversity Matters (PDF–946KB). The findings
   were clear:
     * Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are
       35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their
       respective national industry medians.
     * Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent
       more likely to have financial returns above their respective
       national industry medians.
     * Companies in the bottom quartile both for gender and for ethnicity
       and race are statistically less likely to achieve above-average
       financial returns than the average companies in the data set (that
       is, bottom-quartile companies are lagging rather than merely not
       leading).
     * In the United States, there is a linear relationship between racial
       and ethnic diversity and better financial performance: for every 10
       percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the
       senior-executive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
       rise 0.8 percent.
     * Racial and ethnic diversity has a stronger impact on financial
       performance in the United States than gender diversity, perhaps
       because earlier efforts to increase women’s representation in the
       top levels of business have already yielded positive results.
     * In the United Kingdom, greater gender diversity on the
       senior-executive team corresponded to the highest performance
       uplift in our data set: for every 10 percent increase in gender
       diversity, EBIT rose by 3.5 percent.
     * While certain industries perform better on gender diversity and
       other industries on ethnic and racial diversity, no industry or
       company is in the top quartile on both dimensions.
     * The unequal performance of companies in the same industry and the
       same country implies that diversity is a competitive differentiator
       shifting market share toward more diverse companies.

   We’re not suggesting that achieving greater diversity is easy.
   Women—accounting for an average of just 16 percent of the members of
   executive teams in the United States, 12 percent in the United Kingdom,
   and 6 percent in Brazil—remain underrepresented at the top of
   corporations globally. The United Kingdom does comparatively better in
   racial diversity, albeit at a low level: some 78 percent of UK
   companies have senior-leadership teams that fail to reflect the
   demographic composition of the country’s labor force and population,
   compared with 91 percent for Brazil and 97 percent for the United
   States.

   These numbers underline the work that remains to be done, even as the
   case for greater diversity becomes more compelling. We live in a deeply
   connected and global world. It should come as no surprise that more
   diverse companies and institutions are achieving better performance.
   Most organizations, including McKinsey, must do more to take full
   advantage of the opportunity that diverse leadership teams represent.
   That’s particularly true for their talent pipelines: attracting,
   developing, mentoring, sponsoring, and retaining the next generations
   of global leaders at all levels of organizations. Given the higher
   returns that diversity is expected to bring, we believe it is better to
   invest now, since winners will pull further ahead and laggards will
   fall further behind.

   Technologies available today could automate more than half of the
   source-to-pay process. The potential? Lower procurement costs, greater
   savings, and more opportunities to pursue new sources of value.

   Summer 2021. The engineering department has finalized its concept
   design for a critical component in the next product generation. The
   procurement team enters the specifications into an
   analytics-based sourcing system, which interprets the document
   and—drawing on its database of suppliers and the outcomes of prior
   sourcing efforts—identifies three current suppliers, plus two newly
   added companies able to produce the part.

   Next, the system automatically draws up an electronic request for
   quotation and sends it to the potential suppliers. When their quotes
   come back, it conducts an automated review, basing its analysis on
   internal clean-sheet cost models for the parts, together with data on
   each supplier’s capabilities and structural costs. The report it
   generates highlights the top negotiating points for the procurement
   team—and the system continues to revise its models and guidance as the
   negotiations proceed.

   Once supply commences, the sourcing system continually monitors the
   winning suppliers, covering not only their quality and delivery
   performance but also their progress on the ongoing cost reduction they
   agreed to during the sourcing process. Exceptions trigger a series of
   automated mitigating actions, with procurement staff alerted only if
   the actions fail to get supply back on track.

   This scenario is closer to reality than you might expect—perhaps well
   before the summer of 2021. Much of consumer purchasing has already been
   digitized, and some is even automated: sensor-laden, Internet-connected
   printers can detect when ink is low and order replacement cartridges,
   with no intervention from the user.

   Defining source-to-pay

   We define source-to-pay as the end-to-end value stream that encompasses
   all the activities required for an organization to obtain and pay for
   goods and services from other entities. These activities start with the
   development of specific sourcing strategies to best obtain the goods
   and services an organization needs. They continue with the selection of
   specific suppliers, contracting with those suppliers, the placement of
   orders, the verification that appropriate goods and services have been
   delivered, and finally the authorization and release of payment. In
   addition to these core tasks, the overall value stream also includes
   the activities necessary to support the end-to-end process, such as
   vendor and master-data management (exhibit).

   Large enterprises have not been so successful. Despite significant
   interest and investment, traditional approaches to automating
   source-to-pay (see sidebar, “Defining source-to-pay”) have yet to
   deliver on the promise of a fully digital process requiring minimal
   human involvement.

   That may be about to change. Several emerging technologies, including
   robotic process automation (RPA), machine learning, and advanced
   artificial-intelligence programs or “cognitive agents,” have the
   potential to overcome hitherto stubborn barriers to automation in the
   enterprise environment. By applying a new form of analysis to the
   hundreds of individual tasks involved in the source-to-pay process, we
   have found that almost 60 percent of them have the potential to be
   fully or largely automated using currently available technologies.
   Crucially, we found significant automation potential not only in
   transactional activities, such as order and invoice processing, but
   also in sourcing’s strategic elements, such as vendor selection and
   management.

   The payback on a robust, automated end-to-end source-to-pay process
   could be high. Industry benchmarks suggest that most organizations
   waste 3 to 4 percent of their overall external spend on excessive
   transaction costs, inefficiency, and noncompliance (Exhibit 1). For an
   organization with an annual spend of $2 billion, eliminating that
   leakage could send $70 million a year straight to the bottom line.

The role of emerging technologies in source-to-pay automation

   Advances in software and artificial intelligence have vastly expanded
   both the number of activities that can be automated and the degree of
   automation that is possible. For example, the McKinsey Global Institute
   has found that across occupations, activities accounting for 46 percent
   of US workers’ time could be automated using already-demonstrated
   technologies.^1 1.For more, see Harnessing automation for a future that
   works, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2017.

   We believe that five emerging technologies are particularly pertinent
   to source-to-pay:
     * Robotic process automation uses simple rules to emulate repeatable
       tasks that would otherwise be performed by human users of software.
       One large advantage of RPA is that, unlike traditional
       system-integration approaches requiring access to each relevant
       software program’s underlying code, the bots that perform specific
       tasks only need to access other software in the same way a human
       user would. A consequence is that bots can only perform tasks in
       situations where there is no room for interpretation—but many tasks
       in source-to-pay (such as invoice upload and approval) are
       sufficiently unambiguous to make deployment worthwhile.
       RPA can therefore help companies stitch together their existing
       systems, eliminating low-value manual interventions at the
       interfaces between systems and process steps. A large
       basic-materials company found that by deploying bots to scan and
       code invoices directly into its core enterprise-resource-planning
       (ERP) system, it could reduce invoice-processing costs by 80
       percent.
     * Machine-learning algorithms, unlike RPA, can handle tasks that
       involve complex rules and require some form of pattern recognition
       to be executed correctly. Machine learning is therefore suitable
       for tasks that traditionally require some level of human judgment,
       such as the assignment of transactions to formal spend categories
       and subcategories—a crucial first step in uncovering sourcing
       opportunities. A financial institution that is currently deploying
       machine learning for these judgments has greatly increased the
       accuracy and speed of essential analyses, such as the concentration
       of spend by supplier for a given category. As a result, the
       institution is finding procurement savings much more quickly than
       was previously possible.
       At a global technology-services company, machine learning now
       guides its negotiation approach, tracking and evaluating the
       success of different negotiation tactics in different settings. The
       resulting patterns lead to specific recommendations on which type
       of negotiation is likely to be most successful in a particular
       situation.
     * Smart work-flow technologies can link tasks conducted by different
       people and machines into a coherent process with well-defined
       handoffs—even if the combination of tasks differs markedly from
       case to case, as in risk-management processes for supplier
       qualification. A business-services company is piloting a smart
       work-flow solution that dynamically routes work between procurement
       and financial systems according to whichever risk-management logic
       applies to a given supply contract. The system then governs the
       assignment of tasks across all participants in onboarding,
       risk-assessment, and supplier-certification activities, and may
       eventually cover supplier performance management as well.
     * Natural-language-processing (NLP) technologies process textual data
       and provide a convenient way for purchasers to document
       requirements without resorting to drop-down menus or structured
       lists. The technologies are already in use in consumer
       environments, guiding customers to appropriate technical-support
       resources or extracting insights about product performance from
       social-media streams. In procurement, they may assist in organizing
       many types of unstructured information.
       The example that opened this article may sound like science
       fiction, but a European multinational is already piloting such
       technologies (in combination with RPA) to digitize its sourcing
       approach for its long-tail spend—the long list of small purchases
       that together may account for only a few percentage points of the
       budget. Robots in each major external-spend category process
       incoming orders from the business, using NLP to interpret free-form
       text and match order requirements to particular groups of
       suppliers. The procurement system then automatically sends out
       requests for bids, which the robot can compare. An internal buyer
       is notified once the bids have been received, so that he or she can
       decide which bid to accept based on the information provided by the
       robot.
     * Cognitive agents can be deployed whenever a deep knowledge base
       must be quickly searched to determine the right course of action.
       The chatbots that several financial-service institutions now use in
       assisting contact-center staff can answer a wide range of customer
       queries by selecting appropriate responses from a previously
       documented set of answers. In the source-to-pay process, vendor and
       business-procurement help desks often involve similar types of
       interactions, pointing toward a similar solution.
       As the capabilities of cognitive agents improve, they may also
       become useful for even more complex tasks, such as estimating an
       item’s global-sourcing potential by comparing its cost, quality,
       and technology requirements with databases of similar products and
       sourcing decisions. By analyzing supplier capabilities, cognitive
       agents may even be able to make recommendations on the selection of
       specific suppliers.

The automation potential of source-to-pay

   Because source-to-pay is such a complex, diverse set of activities, it
   has not until now been clear exactly how much of the entire end-to-end
   process is suitable for automation or where the primary sources of
   value lie.

   We therefore undertook a new type of analysis that decomposed
   source-to-pay into a large number of discrete tasks. That let us assess
   how easily each task can be automated using currently available
   technologies, and which types of those technologies are most
   appropriate to achieve that level of automation.

   To do this, we employed a “framework of capabilities,” developed by our
   colleagues at the McKinsey Global Institute.^2 2.For more, see
   Harnessing automation for a future that works, McKinsey Global
   Institute, January 2017. This framework classifies the capacities used
   by humans to perform different tasks into 18 specific capabilities
   (Exhibit 2).
   Exhibit 2

   website. If you would like information about this content we will be

   The automation requirements of any task will depend on the specific
   combination of capabilities required, together with the complexity
   associated with the relevant capabilities. For example, some tasks
   might require a modest amount of pattern recognition (for example, the
   data-lookup functions used in spreadsheets), while others may require
   the ability to recognize highly complex patterns (for instance,
   assessing which suppliers are most likely to cease being a sustainable
   source of supply).

Seeing the potential across the entire source-to-pay process

   We mapped the complexity requirements across each of the 18
   capabilities, using a highly granular 240-item taxonomy covering every
   task in the end-to-end source-to-pay process. While a majority of the
   18 capabilities are required at many stages of the process, the level
   of complexity associated with these capabilities is fairly low. In most
   cases, existing technologies can meet those requirements.

   Our analysis shows that, overall, 56 percent of the tasks associated
   with the source-to-pay process are fully or largely automatable using
   existing technologies. That’s a significant finding, suggesting that
   source-to-pay activities as a whole are more suitable for automation
   than is a typical US-based job.

   Unsurprisingly, the automation opportunity is highest in the more
   transactional parts of the process: in placing and receiving orders, 88
   percent of tasks can be automated, and the figure rises to 93 percent
   in payment processing. Moreover, even the strategic elements of
   source-to-pay show considerable automation potential. Our analysis
   shows that 47 percent of vendor-selection and negotiation activities
   can be automated (Exhibit 3).

Choosing the right automation technologies

   Although each task within the end-to-end source-to-pay process needs to
   be evaluated individually, some generalizations can be drawn by
   comparing the requirements of different parts of the process with the
   capabilities offered by different automation approaches (Exhibit 4):

     * NLP technologies are applicable across many tasks in the process,
       as a bridge between human inputs and the most structured data used
       by machines.
     * RPA is most applicable to the more transactional activities
       associated with procure-to-invoice and invoice-to-pay activities.
     * Smart work flows apply to more-complex transactional activities,
       and especially in vendor management with its high degree of
       contextual information and its need to coordinate among multiple
       parties.
     * Machine-learning and cognitive-agent capabilities are most
       applicable to the more complex activities associated with the
       initial parts of the source-to-pay process, such as the development
       of spend-category strategies and the identification and selection
       of potential suppliers.

   The next-generation operating model for the digital world

The starting point in source-to-pay automation

   For companies, the next step is to identify the best targets for
   automation within their own processes. Organizations can do this by
   first evaluating the current level of automation they have implemented,
   compared with what is technically achievable for each task in the
   source-to-pay process. They can then estimate the value of closing each
   gap.

   This value will come both from the amount of work that can be automated
   and from likely improvements in compliance, cycle times, and payment
   terms associated with each step. Any gains must be set against the cost
   and complexity of implementing suitable technologies. Robotic process
   automation and smart work-flow solutions are likely to be quicker and
   cheaper to implement than sophisticated machine-learning technologies
   and cognitive agents, for example.

   The emerging picture of the end-to-end process will provide a
   comparison of the relative benefits of addressing each step within it,
   set against the relative cost and difficulty of automating those steps.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The digital landscape is moving quickly. Companies that are prepared to
   experiment while taking a thoughtful, focused approach to the
   application of these technologies are likely to reap savings worth as
   much as 3.5 percent of all external spend. Even more important, by
   freeing sourcing personnel from routine tasks, automation allows them
   to spend time pursuing innovative sources of additional value.

   Novas pesquisas evidenciam, cada vez mais, que empresas que valorizam e
   adotam a diversidade apresentam melhor performance financeira.

   Sabemos intuitivamente que a diversidade é importante. E vai ficando
   cada vez mais claro que ela também faz sentido estritamente em termos
   de negócios. Nossa pesquisa mais recente constatou que as empresas no
   quartil superior em termos de diversidade de gênero ou de raça e etnia
   tendem a obter retornos financeiros acima da média do setor. As
   empresas que têm essas dimensões no quartil inferior são
   estatisticamente menos propensas a obter retornos acima da média. Além
   disso, a diversidade é provavelmente um diferencial competitivo que, ao
   longo do tempo, transfere market share para as empresas mais
   diversificadas.

   Embora a correlação não signifique uma consequência inevitável (a maior
   diversidade de gênero e de etnia na liderança corporativa não se traduz
   automaticamente em mais lucros), ela indica que, quando as empresas se
   comprometem a ter uma liderança diversificada, elas são mais
   bem-sucedidas. Acreditamos que empresas mais diversificadas são capazes
   de conquistar profissionais de maior talento, aumentar sua orientação
   para o cliente e a satisfação dos funcionários, e melhorar a tomada de
   decisões, levando a um círculo virtuoso de retornos crescentes. Isso,
   por sua vez, sugere que outros tipos de diversidade – por exemplo, de
   idade, orientação sexual e experiência (tais como uma mentalidade
   global e fluência cultural) – também podem propiciar certa vantagem
   competitiva para as empresas que conseguirem atrair e reter talentos
   tão diversificados.

   A McKinsey vem estudando a diversidade no local de trabalho há vários
   anos. Nosso último relatório, Diversity Matters [A diversidade é
   importante], examinou conjuntos de dados de propriedade exclusiva de
   366 empresas de capital aberto, de ampla gama de setores, no Canadá,
   América Latina, Reino Unido e Estados Unidos. Nessa pesquisa,
   analisamos várias métricas, como resultados financeiros e a composição
   da alta gerência e dos conselhos de administração.1As conclusões foram
   claras:
     * As empresas no quartil superior em diversidade racial e étnica são
       35% mais propensas a obter retornos financeiros acima da média
       nacional de seu setor.
     * As empresas no quartil superior em diversidade de gênero são 15%
       mais propensas a obter retornos financeiros acima da média nacional
       de seu setor.
     * As empresas no quartil inferior tanto em diversidade de gênero
       quanto em etnia e raça são estatisticamente menos propensas a obter
       retornos financeiros acima da média do que empresas médias do
       conjunto de dados (ou seja, empresas no quartil inferior não só não
       estão liderando, como estão ficando para trás).
     * Nos Estados Unidos, há uma relação linear entre diversidade racial
       e étnica e melhor performance financeira: para cada 10% de aumento
       na diversidade racial e étnica dos executivos seniores, o lucro
       antes dos juros e impostos (EBIT) aumenta 0,8%.
     * Também nos Estados Unidos, a diversidade racial e étnica tem
       impacto mais forte do que a diversidade de gênero sobre a
       performance financeira, talvez porque esforços anteriores para
       aumentar a representação das mulheres nos altos escalões das
       empresas já tenham produzido resultados positivos.
     * No Reino Unido, a diversidade de gênero entre executivos seniores
       correspondeu ao maior aumento da performance dentre os países do
       nosso conjunto de dados: para cada 10% de aumento na diversidade de
       gênero, o EBIT aumentou 3,5%.
     * Embora alguns setores apresentem melhor performance quando há
       diversidade de gênero e outros quando há diversidade étnica e
       racial, nenhum setor ou empresa está no quartil superior em ambas
       as dimensões.
     * A performance desigual de empresas do mesmo setor e do mesmo país
       implica que a diversidade é um diferencial competitivo que
       transfere market share para empresas mais diversificadas.

   Não estamos sugerindo que alcançar maior diversidade seja fácil. As
   mulheres – que, em média, são apenas 16% dos membros das equipes
   executivas dos Estados Unidos, 12% no Reino Unido e 6% no Brasil –
   permanecem sub-representadas nos altos escalões de empresas do mundo
   inteiro. O Reino Unido sai-se comparativamente melhor em diversidade
   racial, ainda que em um nível ainda bastante baixo: em cerca de 78% das
   empresas do Reino Unido, a equipe de alta liderança não reflete a
   composição demográfica da força de trabalho e da população do país (em
   comparação com 91% das empresas do Brasil e 97% dos Estados Unidos).

   Esses números realçam todo o trabalho que resta a ser feito, ainda que
   os benefícios da maior diversidade sejam incontestáveis. Vivemos em um
   mundo profundamente conectado e global. Não deveríamos nos surpreender,
   portanto, que empresas e instituições mais diversificadas apresentem
   melhor performance. A maioria das organizações, incluindo a McKinsey,
   precisa fazer mais para aproveitar melhor a oportunidade que equipes
   diversificadas de liderança representam. Isso é particularmente
   verdadeiro no que diz respeito aos pipelines de talentos, isto é,
   atrair, desenvolver, orientar, patrocinar e reter as próximas gerações
   de líderes globais em todos os níveis de organizações. Em vista dos
   retornos mais elevados que se espera que a diversidade produza,
   acreditamos que seja melhor investir agora, pois os vencedores
   avançarão cada vez mais e os retardatários ficarão cada vez mais para
   trás.

   As tecnologias disponíveis atualmente poderiam automatizar mais da
   metade do processo de source-to-pay. Qual o potencial? Menores custos
   de compras, maiores economias e mais oportunidades de explorar novas
   fontes de valor.

   Verão de 2021. O departamento de engenharia finalizou o projeto
   conceitual de um componente crítico de um produto da próxima geração. A
   equipe de compras insere as especificações em um sistema de sourcing
   baseado em analytics, que interpreta o documento e – recorrendo a sua
   base de dados de fornecedores e resultados de iniciativas anteriores de
   sourcing – identifica três fornecedores atuais, além de duas empresas
   adicionadas recentemente, capazes de produzir a peça.

   Em seguida, o sistema prepara automaticamente um pedido eletrônico de
   cotação e o envia aos fornecedores potenciais. O sistema faz uma
   revisão automática das cotações recebidas, baseando sua análise em
   modelos internos de custo clean sheet de todas as peças, juntamente com
   dados sobre as capacidades e os custos estruturais de cada fornecedor.
   O relatório assim gerado destaca os principais pontos de negociação
   para a equipe de compras – e o sistema continua a rever seus modelos e
   orientações à medida que as negociações avançam.

   Depois de iniciado o fornecimento, o sistema de sourcing monitora
   continuamente os fornecedores vencedores, abrangendo não apenas sua
   performance de qualidade e entrega, mas também seu progresso em relação
   à redução constante de custos acordada durante o processo de sourcing.
   As exceções desencadeiam uma série de ações de mitigação automatizadas
   e a equipe de Compras é alertada somente se essas ações não conseguirem
   corrigir o fornecimento.

   Esse cenário está mais próximo da realidade do que se poderia supor –
   talvez bem antes do “verão de 2021”. Grande parte das compras de
   consumo já foi digitalizada, e algumas até automatizadas: impressoras
   equipadas com sensores e conectadas à internet detectam quando o nível
   de tinta está baixo e encomendam cartuchos de reposição, sem nenhuma
   intervenção do usuário.

   Definição de source-to-pay

   Definimos source-to-pay como o process que abrange todas as atividades
   necessárias para uma organização adquirir e pagar bens e serviços de
   terceiros. Essas atividades começam com a formulação de estratégias
   específicas de sourcing com a melhor forma de a organização obter os
   bens e serviços de que necessita. E continuam com a seleção de
   fornecedores específicos, o estabelecimento de contato com esses
   fornecedores, a colocação de pedidos, a verificação da entrega dos bens
   e serviços em questão e, finalmente, a autorização e a liberação do
   pagamento. Além dessas tarefas básicas, o processo também engloba as
   atividades necessárias para apoiar o processo de ponta a ponta, como
   gestão de fornecedores e de masterdata, como mostra o Quadro a seguir.

   As grandes empresas não têm tido tanto sucesso assim. Apesar do
   significativo interesse e investimento, as abordagens tradicionais à
   automatização do source-to-pay (ver sidebar “Definição de
   source-to-pay”) ainda não cumpriram a promessa de um processo
   totalmente digital, que exija o mínimo de envolvimento humano.

   Mas isso pode estar prestes a mudar. Várias tecnologias emergentes,
   incluindo automação robótica de processos (RPA), machine learning e
   programas avançados de inteligência artificial, ou “agente cognitivos”,
   têm o potencial de superar as barreiras à automação no ambiente
   empresarial. Ao aplicar uma nova forma de análise às centenas de
   tarefas envolvidas no processo source-to-pay, constatamos que quase 60%
   delas têm possibilidade de serem total ou parcialmente automatizadas,
   usando tecnologias já disponíveis. É de importância fundamental o fato
   de termos encontrado significativo potencial de automatização não
   apenas em atividades transacionais, como processamento de pedidos e
   faturas, mas também nos elementos estratégicos do sourcing, como
   seleção e gestão de fornecedores.

   O retorno de um processo robusto e automatizado e completo de
   source-to-pay pode ser elevado. Benchmarks da indústria indicam que a
   maioria das organizações desperdiça de 3 a 4% de seus gastos externos
   totais com custos excessivos de transação, ineficiência e noncompliance
   (Quadro 1). Para uma organização com gastos anuais de US$2 bilhões,
   eliminar essa perda poderia significar a injeção de US$70 milhões
   anuais diretamente no lucro.

Papel das tecnologias emergentes na automação de source-to-pay

   Avanços em software e inteligência artificial ampliaram enormemente o
   número de atividades passíveis de automação e o grau possível de
   automação. Para exemplificar, o McKinsey Global Institute constatou
   que, em todas as ocupações, atividades que representam 46% do tempo dos
   trabalhadores dos EUA poderiam ser automatizadas mediante o uso de
   tecnologias já demonstradas.^1 1.Para saber mais, ver Harnessing
   automation for a future that Works, McKinsey Global Institute, janeiro
   de 2017.

   Acreditamos que cinco tecnologias emergentes são particularmente
   pertinentes ao processo source-to-pay:
     * Automação robótica de processos (RPA): utiliza regras simples para
       emular tarefas repetidas que, de outra forma, seriam executadas por
       usuários humanos de software. Uma das grandes vantagens da RPA é
       que, diferentemente das abordagens tradicionais de integração de
       sistemas que exigem acesso a cada código relevante do respectivo
       software, o bots que executa tarefas específicas precisaria apenas
       acessar outro software, da mesma forma que um ser humano faria. Uma
       das consequências desse aspecto é que o bots somente consegue
       executar tarefas nas situações em que não há espaço para
       interpretação – mas muitas tarefas do source-to-pay (como a carga e
       aprovação de faturas) são suficientemente inequívocas para fazer a
       implementação valer a pena.
       Assim, RPA pode ajudar as empresas a “costurar” seus sistemas já
       existentes, eliminando intervenções manuais de baixo valor nas
       interfaces entre os sistemas e os passos do processo. Uma grande
       empresa de materiais básicos verificou que, ao utilizar bots para
       digitalizar e codificar códigos diretamente em seu sistema básico
       de planejamento de recursos de empresa (ERP), ela poderia reduzir
       em 80% os custos de processamento de faturas.
     * Algoritmos de machine-learning:, ao contrário de RPA, podem lidar
       com tarefas que envolvem regras complexas e exigem algum tipo de
       reconhecimento de padrões para serem executados corretamente. Desse
       modo, machine learning se presta a tarefas que tradicionalmente
       exigem algum grau de discernimento humano, como a designação de
       transações a categorias e subcategorias formais de gastos – um
       primeiro passo crucial para revelar oportunidades de sourcing. Uma
       instituição financeira que está implementando machine learning para
       essa applicação conseguiu aumentar enormemente a exatidão e a
       velocidade de análises essenciais, como a concentração de gastos
       por fornecedor de uma dada categoria. Como resultado, a instituição
       passou a identificar economias em compras com muito mais velocidade
       do que anteriormente.
       Em uma empresa global de serviços de tecnologia, machine learning
       passou a nortear sua abordagem de negociação, rastreando e
       avaliando o sucesso de diferentes táticas de negociação em
       diferentes cenários. Os padrões resultantes levam a recomendações
       específicas sobre qual tipo de negociação provavelmente terá o
       maior sucesso em um determinado contexto.
     * Fluxo de trabalho inteligente refere-se a tecnologias capazes de
       interligar tarefas realizadas por diferentes pessoas e máquinas em
       um processo coerente com transferências bem definidas – até mesmo
       se a combinação de tarefas diferir acentuadamente de caso a caso,
       como nos processos de gestão de riscos na qualificação de
       fornecedores. Uma empresa de serviços de negócios está pilotando
       uma solução de fluxo de trabalho inteligente que distribui
       dinamicamente o trabalho entre os sistemas de compras e financeiro,
       de acordo com qualquer que seja a lógica de gestão de riscos que se
       aplica a um determinado contrato de suprimento. Em seguida, o
       sistema determina a designação de tarefas a todos os participantes
       das atividades de integração, avaliação de riscos e certificação de
       fornecedores, podendo até abranger a performance de fornecedores.
     * Processamento de linguagem natural (NLP) são tecnologias que
       processam dados de textos e constituem uma maneira conveniente para
       os compradores documentarem os requisitos sem recorrer a menus
       verticais ou listas estruturadas. Essas tecnologias já estão em uso
       em ambientes de consumo, direcionando os clientes a recursos
       adequados de suporte técnico ou extraindo insights sobre
       performance de produtos em mídia social. Na área de compras, elas
       podem ajudar a organizar muitos tipos de informações não
       estruturadas.
       O exemplo do início deste artigo pode soar como ficção científica,
       mas uma multinacional europeia já está conduzindo pilotos dessas
       tecnologias (em combinação com RPA) para digitalizar sua abordagem
       de sourcing para seus gastos long-tail – a longa lista de pequenas
       compras que, juntas, podem representar apenas alguns pontos
       percentuais do orçamento. Robôs em cada grande categoria de gastos
       externos processam os pedidos recebidos, usando NLP para
       interpretar texto em forma livre e encontrar a correspondência
       entre os requisitos do pedido e grupos específicos de fornecedores.
       Em seguida, o sistema de compras envia automaticamente solicitações
       de cotação, que o robô pode comparar. Um comprador interno é
       avisado assim que as cotações são recebidos, para poder decidir
       qual pedido aceitar com base nas informações fornecidas pelo robô.
     * Agentes cognitivos: podem ser implementados sempre que for preciso
       pesquisar rapidamente uma base de conhecimento profundo para
       definir o melhor curso de ação. Os chatbots, que várias
       instituições de serviços financeiros estão usando para auxiliar o
       pessoal de contact centers, podem responder a uma ampla gama de
       consultas de clientes, selecionando respostas apropriadas dentro um
       conjunto previamente documentado de respostas. No processo
       source-to-pay, muitos help desks de fornecedores e de compras de
       empresas envolvem tipos semelhantes de interações, apontando para
       uma solução similar.
       À medida que se aprimoram, as capacidades dos agentes cognitivos
       também podem tornar-se úteis até para tarefas mais complexas, como
       a estimativa do potencial de sourcing global de um item, comparando
       seu custo, qualidade e requisitos tecnológicos com bases de dados
       de produtos e decisões de sourcing semelhantes. Ao analisar as
       capacidades de fornecedores, os agentes cognitivos podem até ser
       capazes de fazer recomendações sobre a seleção de fornecedores
       específicos.

O potencial de automação do source-to-pay

   Por ser um conjunto muito complexo e diversificado de atividades, até
   agora não estava claro exatamente quanto do processo completo de
   source-to-pay poderia ser automatizado ou onde estavam as principais
   fontes de valor.

   Desta forma, procedemos a um novo tipo de análise, decompondo o
   source-to-pay em um grande número de tarefas separadas. Isso nos
   permitiu avaliar o grau de facilidade de automatização de cada tarefa
   usando as tecnologias atualmente disponíveis, e quais tipos dessas
   tecnologias são os mais apropriados para atingir o nível desejado de
   automatização.

   Para tanto, utilizamos um “framework de capacidades” criada por nossos
   colegas do McKinsey Global Institute. ^2 2.For more, see Harnessing
   automation for a future that works, McKinsey Global Institute, January
   2017. Esse framework classifica as capacidades usadas por seres humanos
   para realizar diferentes tarefas em 18 grupos específicos (Quadro 2).
   Quadro 2

   Os requisitos de automatização de qualquer tarefa dependem da
   combinação específica de capacidades requeridas, juntamente com a
   complexidade relacionada às capacidades em questão. Algumas tarefas,
   por exemplo, exigem um grau moderado de reconhecimento de padrões (como
   é o caso das funções de pesquisa de dados usadas em planilhas),
   enquanto outras podem exigir a capacidade de reconhecer padrões
   altamente complexos (como ocorre na avaliação de quais fornecedores têm
   maior probabilidade de deixarem de ser uma fonte contínua de
   fornecimento).

Visualização do potencial do processo completo de source-to-pay

   Mapeamos os requisitos de complexidade de cada uma das 18 capacidades
   usando uma taxonomia altamente granular de 240 itens, abrangendo todas
   as tarefas do processo completo de source-to-pay. Embora a maioria das
   18 capacidades seja necessária em muitas etapas do processo, o grau de
   complexidade relacionado a elas é relativamente baixo. Na maioria dos
   casos, as tecnologias já existentes podem suprir esses requisitos.
   Nossa abordagem mostra que, no total, 56% das tarefas referentes ao
   processo source-to-pay podem ser automatizadas por completo ou em
   grande parte usando tecnologias existentes. Trata-se de uma constatação
   importante, indicando que as atividades de source-to-pay, como um todo,
   são mais passíveis de automatização do que um emprego típico nos EUA.

   Como seria de esperar, a oportunidade de automatização é maior nas
   partes mais transacionais do processo: em colocação e recebimento de
   pedidos, 88% das tarefas podem ser automatizadas e essa proporção sobe
   para 93% em processamento de pagamentos. Além disso, até os elementos
   estratégicos de source-to-pay apresentam considerável potencial de
   automatização. Nossa análise mostra que 47% das atividades de seleção e
   negociação com fornecedores podem ser automatizadas (Quadro 3).

Escolha das tecnologias de automatização certas

   Embora cada tarefa do processo total de source-to-pay precise ser
   avaliada individualmente, é possível fazer algumas generalizações por
   meio da comparação dos requisitos das diferentes partes do processo com
   as capacidades oferecidas por diferentes abordagens de automação

     * RPA é mais aplicável às atividades de cunho mais transacional
       relativas às atividades de “compra à fatura” e de “fatura ao
       pagamento”.
     * Os fluxos de trabalho inteligentes se aplicam a atividades
       transacionais mais complexas, sobretudo em gestão de fornecedores,
       com seu alto grau de informações contextuais e sua necessidade de
       coordenar vários participantes.
     * As capacidades de machine learning e agente cognitivo se aplicam
       melhor às atividades mais complexas relacionadas às partes iniciais
       do processo source-to-pay, como formulação de estratégias de
       categorias de gastos e identificação e seleção de fornecedores
       potenciais.

Ponto de partida da automatização de source-to-pay

   Para as empresas, o próximo passo é identificar os melhores alvos de
   automatização em seus próprios processos. Para tanto, as organizações
   podem avaliar primeiramente o nível atual de automatização já
   implementado em comparação com o que é tecnicamente viável em cada
   tarefa do processo source-to-pay. Com isso, elas podem estimar o valor
   proporcionado pela eliminação de cada lacuna.

   Esse valor é proveniente tanto da quantidade de trabalho que pode ser
   automatizado como das prováveis melhorias em compliance, tempos de
   ciclo e prazos de pagamento relacionadas a cada passo. Os eventuais
   ganhos precisam ser cotejados com o custo e a complexidade da
   implementação de tecnologias adequadas. As soluções de automação
   robótica de processos e fluxo de trabalho inteligente provavelmente são
   de implementação mais rápida e barata do que tecnologias sofisticadas
   como machine learning e agentes cognitivos, por exemplo.

   O quadro emergente do processo completo permitirá comparar os
   benefícios relacionados a cada um dos passos com o custo e a
   dificuldade de automatizá-los.
     __________________________________________________________________

   O cenário digital avança com celeridade. As empresas que estiverem
   preparadas para experimentar, adotando uma abordagem cuidadosa e focada
   à aplicação dessas tecnologias provavelmente obterão economias de até
   3,5% de todos os gastos externos. E o mais importante, ao liberar as
   equipes de sourcing de tarefas rotineiras, a automação permite que elas
   dediquem mais tempo à busca de fontes inovadoras de valor adicional.
