   “It could happen in a matter of months,” says Martin Mlynczak of NASA’s
   Langley Research Center.
   ________________

   “The sun is entering one of the deepest Solar Minima of the Space Age,”
   wrote Dr Tony Phillips just six weeks ago, on 27 Sep 2018.

   Sunspots have been absent for most of 2018 and Earth’s upper atmosphere
   is responding, says Phillips, editor of spaceweather.com.

   Data from NASA’s TIMED satellite show that the thermosphere (the
   uppermost layer of air around our planet) is cooling and shrinking,
   literally decreasing the radius of the atmosphere.

   To help track the latest developments, Martin Mlynczak of NASA’s
   Langley Research Center and his colleagues recently introduced the
   “Thermosphere Climate Index.”

   The Thermosphere Climate Index (TCI) tells how much heat nitric oxide
   (NO) molecules are dumping into space. During Solar Maximum, TCI is
   high (meaning “Hot”); during Solar Minimum, it is low (meaning “Cold”).

   “Right now, it is very low indeed … 10 times smaller than we see during
   more active phases of the solar cycle,” says Mlynczak
   The Thermosphere Climate Index by Mlynczak and colleagues.
   Displays times of Cold, Cool, Neutral, Warm, and Hot since 1940.

   Record cold in a matter of months

   “If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for
   cold,” says Mlynczak. “We’re not there quite yet, but it could happen
   in a matter of months.”

       at spaceweathers page 1957 is THE hottest listed
       funny how not a single warmist devotee is going to mention this….
       wonder if a few wars lotsa heat emitting bombs and a series of
       atomic tests mighta helped along with the sun for that?ie 40s to
       late 60s
       and as of tonights look we have a new sunspot after 24 spotfree
       days
       damned if I could even see what they’d circled;-)

       Dr. Mlynczak has broken the unspoken rule that no one can depart
       from the CAGW meme without professional disaster. He will soon be
       flipping burgers at McDonald’s.

            Not if enough of us who pay attention to REAL scientific
            evidence such as this share it with others who simply don’t
            pay attention. The Grand Solar Minimum is upon us and it won’t
            take long for major crop losses to start having major impacts
            worldwide.

                 1) I’ve read he’s an alarmist, so he may not be the one
                 you want to hang your hat on.
                 2) Even if he isn’t, the other side long ago gave up on
                 actual science. You could show them tangible evidence
                 dating back centuries and they’d accuse you of being a
                 Russian. There is no using logic/facts to make your case
                 with them. We’re past that point.

                 multicultural/multiracial?
                 This is not required of -ANY- non white people

            Adam,
            I hope you are wrong, but fear you are right that Dr. Miynczak
            could be fired. International sun spot sites like SILSO record
            sunspot activity for all to see. Sadly fact does not match the
            “global warming narrative”
            Climate change is real, like the Maunder minimum.
            Sadly Solar cycle 25 may be even lower leading to what TIME
            magazine reported as “the upcoming little ice age”
            Knowledge is power – just read multiple sites and think!

            Where does he say anything about global warming? He’s just
            saying we’re entering a sunspot minimum which coincides with a
            solar minimum, but that cycle lasts only a few years, no? So
            maybe we get a few years delay on further warming, or maybe
            not. If we do get a respite from the heat once the solar
            minimum is done, we’ll see global warming resume with a
            vengeance because regardless of what climate science tells us,
            we’re going to do very little, if anything, to curb greenhouse
            gas emissions. So not to worry, carbon fuels are here to stay,
            until they’re all burned up.

            There is a new direction in the White House, so NASA is
            tailoring their “research” so they can get funding. Notice
            they got into “Climate Change” after the space shuttle program
            was shut down.

                 We’ll drill more oil and gas in Texas, Kansas and
                 Oklahoma to keep all the coast line liberals warm. And I
                 guess we can stop worrying about the icecaps melting and
                 flooding out the polar bear population…wait, can’t they
                 swim?! On a serious note, has anybody been watching
                 natural gas? Very low storage going into winter. Price
                 has skyrocketed from sub $3 to above $4/mcf in a few
                 weeks! As me move off coal to nat gas for electric
                 generation, underground storage will become very
                 important to monitor. It won’t help that we can breath
                 better, if we can’t afford to heat our homes.

                 First, why assume Teddi is a guy? And second, Teddi is
                 sayig that NASA should worry about the Sun and the
                 planets, and leave the weather forecasting (and Muslim
                 outreach) to groups like the NOAA. So what’s Teddi saying
                 that differs from you?

       One of the worst aspects of this mess is that the soft commodities
       which are food are lower in price now than 10 years ago. A strong
       USD will do that. But with the trade war, farmers are really
       hurting. So instead of helping them at this critical time, they are
       going bankrupt, without any weather impact necessary. Add in
       extreme weather impacts and we will be in for a world of hurt.

       Oh come on deniers. Gov. Jerry Brown just assured us that climate
       change (meaning global warming) is driving the California wild
       fires. Thus, the earth is warming, not cooling. Any argument to the
       contrary is wrong, got it, wrong. When the argument deviates from
       the narrative consensus of human caused climate change, the
       argument is wrong.
       Climate change is driven by CO2, got it? No other factors are in
       play, got it. Ice ages ended because of SUV’s, camp fires and other
       human causes. Nothing but CO2 variations drive the climate. And if
       you believe any of that, I’ll be happy to sell you the Brooklyn
       Bridge at a very reasonable price; cash only, thanks.

       “human-caused climate change” was created in 1941 by Hermann Flohn,
       a scientist for the German Meteorological Service who became the
       chief meteorologist for the Luftwaffe High Command.
       In order to pursue their stated goal of “preventing harm to the
       environment,” Hitler’s Third Reich passed the
       Reichsnaturschutzgesetz (Reich Nature Protection Law) in 1933.
       According to Duncan Bayne in “How to Spot a Nazi,” the purpose of
       this act was to increase control over the German populace by
       requiring that decisions on how a person could use his property be
       first approved by the Reich. Sound familiar?

       Look at NASA and Russian projections of Solar cycle 25 & 26 .
       NASA also has Spaceweather.com which is not PC but real science.
       The graphs of the solar cycles going back to the invention of the
       telescope made it possible to observe solar flares / sun spots
       which are the TRUE indicator of earth temperature variations,
       clearly not mankind. Al Gore is a buffoon or just a crook , either
       way bad news for the uneducated.

       Solar output regularly drops by about 2 percent from the peak of

       global warming is about to get much worse.
       2. Claim that the cooling is proof that climate change regulations
       are beginning to produce results
       3. Sunspot forecasts are added to the weather channel
       4. Facebook bans sunspot posts as fake news
       5. Hollywood releases a science fiction film called “Game of
       Sunspots” featuring the world’s first dwarf astronaut, and incest
       between twin astronauts on the space station.
       6. NASA requests $ 1 trillion for its sunspot monitoring space

       7. Sunspot deniers claim all the spots are simply on the dark side
       of the sun, where we can’t see them

       Can’t any of you guys understand? Maybe not, since this true
       article is worded in a very misleading way. The reporting does say,
       although it glosses over it quickly so you don’t notice, the fact
       that NASA said it’s talking about the UPPER atmosphere. ONLY.
       That’s NOT the LOWER atmosphere and surface, where of course we
       are.
       Just look at the chart and see where we had another sunspot minimum
       in 1998 – when surface temperatures were reaching a very HIGH PEAK,
       which then backed off a bit and was not surpassed for about 18
       years. That right there tells you there is no correlation between
       the regular sunspot minimum and SURFACE cold.

   Mike Mann
       November 13, 2018 at 3:53 am
       Nope…Lack of sunspots is a Trump conspiracy to upend the AGW
       theorists who hate the man. Obviously, since Trump is
       “anti-science” and “hates everyone”, he wants the earth to have
       record heat waves and blizzard conditions as well so as to ruin
       everyone’s lives. The sunspot machine, originally designed by
       Migeulito Loveless in 1875 and bought by Ronald Reagan in 1986 was
       never used until Trump plugged it in using money stolen from the
       poor and causing Tesla founder and chairman, Elon Musk to engage in
       corruption to avoid going broke.

       November 13, 2018 at 4:10 am
       In context (of the original publication), “record cold” does not
       apply to the planet as a whole.
       Ignorance does not make climate change true, false, good, or bad.
       Physical processes are what they are. Outcomes are not necessarily
       predictable and predictions are not necessarily correct.
       At one time it was thought that memory resided in RNA analogous to
       a wire or tape recording. We tried to transfer memory by training
       mice, removing their RNA, and putting it in other mice. The memory
       didn’t move. Some people looked more closely at memory…others more
       closely at RNA.
       Models lend themselves to political exploitation which in turn
       affects funding which leads to a risk of, not necessarily
       purposeful, funding bias. Consensus in science is not about a
       majority agreeing that something is happening. It’s about everyone
       who understands a model seeing the physical process follow in
       consistent accordance.

       Nobody is denying that the climate changes, what is being contested
       is the notion that punitive carbon taxes, and the wholesale
       transfer of middle class wealth to the politically connected “green
       energy” barons will have any effect on it.
       The Climate has been changing long before humans appeared on the
       planet and will continue to do so long after we disappear.
       How many global warming disaster predictions have the AGW alarmists
       made since the Al Gore movie?
       Three, four, five hundred?
       If the global warming alarmist make enough of them, the law of
       averages dictates that some of them is will eventually catch up
       with a naturally occurring climate phenomenon.
       Reasonable people don’t doubt science.
       Reasonable people doubt faulty politically driven science where
       public funding drives the desired results and the desired results
       drives the public funding.

       The so-called “climate deniers” have talked about the influence of
       solar cycles on the climate for years which now appears to be
       playing a role in our current Grand Solar Minimum. Now NASA claims
       to have figured it out instead of citing the work of others: Henrik
       Svensmark, Valentina Zharkova, Nir Shaviv, and Tim Patterson to
       name a few. Hell, you can go all the way back to Charles T. R.
       Wilson who in 1895 produced “rain-like” condensation in moist,
       DUST-FREE air produced by cosmic rays. Too bad the CERN CLOUD folks
       missed the point on the DUST-FREE aspect of Wilson’s work. Wilson
       received the 1927 Nobel Prize in physics for his work because it
       was a nifty way of observing sub-atomic particles that was used
       until circa 1960. Unfortunately, his contribution to his field of
       main interest, meteorology, was lost to history only to be
       re-discovered decades later.

       goes through cycles and that there is little we can do about it. If
       we all reverted back to living like the Amish, the hysterical

       and attempt to raise taxes on anyone who owns these animals.

       IPCC Third Assessment Report
       Chapter 14
       Section 14.2.2.2
       Last paragraph:
       “In sum, a strategy must recognize what is possible. In climate
       research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing
       with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the
       long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
       This information was not included in the Summary Report for
       Policymakers given to the press and public.
       If the climate is indeed a coupled non-linear chaotic system (who
       can doubt the IPCC) then there is no rational or scientific basis
       to make a definitive statement about a future state of the climate.
       At this point the coupled non-linear chaotic nature of the climate
       makes scientific observations academically interesting but
       individually they have no relevance in predicting the future state
       of the climate. The climate is a system which means the
       relationships among these observations are what is important not
       the observations themselves.
       All the public discourse regarding the future state of the climate
       has been based on the false premise that the current climate models
       are predicting the future state of the climate when in fact the
       models are merely projecting these states.
       Predictions are the purview of science. Model projections can only
       agree with predictions when the models duplicate the real world
       which the IPCC says is impossible to do.
       To base public policy on an unknowable state of a system defies
       common sense. However, too much money and political power is at
       stake for the Central Planners to do otherwise.
       I would argue that the Climate Model True Believers are the ones
       taking an unscientific approach to the subject.
       In January 1961 President Eisenhower in his Farewell Address
       identified the situation in which we find ourselves today:
       “Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our
       industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution
       during recent decades.
       In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes
       more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share
       is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal
       government.
       Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been
       overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and
       testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university,
       historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific
       discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.
       Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract
       becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For
       every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic
       computers.
       The prospect of domination of the nation’s scholars by Federal
       employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever
       present and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific
       research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be
       alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could
       itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.
       It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to
       integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the
       principles of our democratic system — ever aiming toward the
       supreme goals of our free society.”
       Other relevant publications from Eric Hoffer are: “The True
       Believer” and “The Temper of Our Times”
       From “The Temper of Our Times”: “Every great cause begins as a
       movement, becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a
       racket.”

            22 years ago two scientists “climatologist I think they call
            themselves) applied for several GRANTS from the US Government
            and from several Corporations who could benefit from the
            correct reports. Well; let’s call them Phineas and Ferb for
            the lack of their real names I forgot. Well ole P&F filed a
            grant thesis on the next “Mini-Ice Age as it relates to
            earth’s climate change, and the effects over the next 20 or so
            years) caused by Man and carbon as a greenhouse gas.
            The US Government had a laugh fest rolling around on the
            floor. Their answer was a resounding ” do you look up every
            time you exit a door to the outside, are the squirrels not in
            hibernation this time of year? “Why” ask Ferb, “because your
            Nuts” replied the grant master. P&F both presented well
            documented charts and theories proving without a doubt they
            were indeed correct that cooling would occur. But no said
            NASA’s best. A few days later Phineas reappeared changing the
            Man Made Global cooling, To Man Made Global Warming knowing
            that the buck is the bottom line , so Ferb lectured the group
            of big wiggs of Swamp origin on how a life’s worth of $100
            dollar bills could be made in a short few years off of a MMGW

       It’s time to learn what climate change really means. Welcome to
       what’s known as a Little Ice Age. It’s part of our planetary cycle
       will last close to 30 years. Thank goodness for good reserves of
       oil and gas. Just think where we’d be if the 1980’s “we’re running
       out of oil” story had been true.

            The climate extremists have brainwashed a lot of people. Just
            think about how large our planet is, how vast our atmosphere
            is, how large our seas and oceans are, how much volcanos spew
            into the atoms sphere and how much of the Earth is
            uninhabited. Man’s footprint on Earth is relatively small
            compared to nature and its influence. Ocean currents, the jet
            stream, wind patterns, the sun, volcanic activity, and control
            of our destiny by extraterrestrials (this is what you should
            really worry about) have a lot more Influence on our climate
            than any impact mankind may have. We certainly have no impact
            on what the sun does or doesn’t do. The cry of “we’re all
            going to die if we don’t clean up our act, tax our population
            into poverty and redistribute our wealth to the third world”
            has gotten old and tired. Our destruction has been going to
            happen in the next seven years for at least 50 years. The
            “scientists” , politicians and con artists such as AlGore have
            all but shut down debate and have made a lot of money from
            this hysteria.

       November 13, 2018 at 8:12 am
       It occurs to me that if the disciples of Gore had even the
       slightest amount of intellectual honesty, they’d do the following:
       1. Admit that although there is a theoretical possibility that
       carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can impact climate, the
       level of impact is akin to claiming that spitting in the ocean
       causes it to rise (albeit very slightly).
       2. Agree that if they still believe their own propaganda, they
       should be willing to have it work the other way. In short, when we
       start to suffer the tremendously dangerous impacts of a colder
       climate, all nations who are not producing their fair share of
       carbon dioxide should be drastically taxed, with the proceeds going
       to carbon-heavy countries, who are doing more than their share to
       combat the cold.
       Obviously this would never happen, because it’s never been about
       the climate. It’s always been about redistributing wealth through
       the UN, from the countries who produce, to the countries who don’t.

       Why doesn’t NASA tell this to the Climate Change idiots who keep
       insisting that we have Global Warming, when the Globalist are just
       using this Climate Change crap to take away American’s Sovereignty
       and FORCE us to belong to their GLOBAL GOVERNMENT where Americans
       will have NO FREEDOM and will be under the UN LAWS and COURTS.

            Because it is in the financial interests of NASA to receive

       a Maunder Minimum. We just don’t have enough data from pre-1600’s

       It talks of the atmosphere condensing in overall size/diameter as
       well. Colder “air” is more dense and heavier that hotter air. Hot
       gas “air” has a much higher rate of movement and disorganization.
       As the molecules have more space to fly around, more energy is
       released making it feel hotter. As the atmosphere condenses, there
       is less movement and therefor less energy released in the form of
       heat, i.e. feels colder.
       What is interesting is that while compressing gas, heat is
       generated. Could the reduced and slow compressing atmosphere due to
       solar inactivity rolling into this minimum have had a causal effect
       of temporary temperature spikes, fueling the climal warmging (combo
       of climate change and global warming since they can’t make up their
       minds) now that we are “there”, it is just going to be colder until
       the sun heats everything up again?!?!

       I don’t necessarily agree with all the global warming stuff, and
       don’t doubt there are people that push it to further their own
       agenda, and I question just how much of it, assuming it is actually
       happening, is due to humans. But I’ve also noticed a habit among
       those that disagree about it to grab onto any little thing to argue
       their case, regardless of whether it actually makes sense, and this
       appears to me to be one of those cases. If you actually look at the
       graph, you’ll see two things. First, the peak averages have a
       general downward trend, meaning that, for the most part, each solar
       maximum period has a correlated lower atmospheric heat loss than
       the last. So if we assume global warming is true, that would
       indicate that solar flare activity has negligible effect on it, as
       (again, ASSUMING it’s true) the planet is warming over time despite
       decreased warming from flare activity. Also, if anything, this
       chart seems to lend credence to the idea of a buildup of greenhouse
       gases, as that would explain (and, in fact, be one of the only
       explanations that makes immediate sense to me) why there’s less
       atmospheric heat loss despite higher solar heat output, as the
       gases would be holding the heat in. In fact, looking at the
       timeline, I can’t help but notice how there was more heat loss
       during the period of the 80s and 90s, when CFCs and the hole in the
       Ozone were a concern, and how it’s been trending down since those
       issues were dealt with. But I’m sure that’s just coincidence.
       Meanwhile, everyone seems laser-focused on just the very tail end
       of the graph, claiming that because it’s hitting a low point, that
       MUST mean global warming isn’t true. First of all, nothing here
       indicates AT ALL that’s what Mlynczak and Phillips were suggesting.
       All they said was that “[t]he sun is entering one of the deepest
       Solar Minima of the Space Age,” which, for one, the “space age” is
       a very short period of time, especially on a geologic and climactic
       scale, and there is nothing in that statement that inherently links
       the phenomenon to global warming. But people are pouncing on it as
       “evidence” to prove their side of the argument. All it means is
       that for a whopping half decade things will cool off, maybe even to
       record (for less than three-quarters of a century that we’ve been
       monitoring it) lows. But then they’ll get warmer again and, again
       ASSUMING global warming is real, this will have no long-term
       effect, at least none apparent by the extremely minimal “data” here
       (one misrepresented graph and a few possibly misrepresented quotes
       given without context). Not exactly science. In fact, the way I
       interpret the graph and quotes is that we’re only months away from
       the low point, after which it will likely start increasing again.
       So, sorry to disappoint all the over-enthusastic people claiming a
       new ice age is upon us, but that just isn’t what the data appears
       to be saying. Honestly, while I do question just how much truth
       there is to global warming, posts and comments like these make me
       question the naysayers perhaps even more.
       If you want to use this graph to support the argument against
       global warming, at least use it correctly. That means first
       understanding (or admitting) that it’s NOT a representation of
       global temperatures, but rather of how much heat is lost into
       space, which is likely only loosely tied to global temperaturs.
       First, as mentioned above, a buildup of gases that hold in heat
       would cause the line to move downward (less heat lost) despite
       stable or even increasing temperatures. Second, as the atmosphere
       shrinks (which the article states is happening), that would have a
       direct and likely significant impact on the amount of heat lost, as
       there’s less surface area through which to lose heat. Finally, if
       you can show (NOT claim; there’s a difference) that the heat loss
       is directly corresponding to the temperature, and not significantly
       affected by those and other factors, THEN there would be basis for
       using this chart as evidence against global warming.
       @Michael Rhoads (and everyone else, since the analogy might help) –
       You can read my above response for more details, but this doesn’t
       actually show that the upper atmosphere is cooling; it simply shows
       that the heat lost is declining. That’s a big difference. If you
       run the faucet (sun) with the stopper open, then close the stopper
       halfway, there will be less water (heat) “lost” down the drain, but
       that doesn’t mean there’s less water coming into or present in the
       sink. Similarly, less heat lost doesn’t mean anything about how
       much heat is actually contained by the atmosphere, and, as I stated
       above, there are reasons why the internal heat could actually be
       stable, or even rising, despite (and perhaps even because of) a
       reduced loss. Instead of the water going down the drain decreasing
       because of reduced output from the faucet (sun), it’s just as
       likely, and perhaps much more so, that it’s because the drain is
       clogged (greenhouse gases), and that is has little to do with
       global temperatures. Keep in mind I don’t necessarily believe in
       global warming, or at least that man is mostly responsible for it,
       but I also like to look at facts, not misrepresentations, which
       this appears to be. This is probably why neither article you read
       explained it, because it’s not accurate, and they’re just throwing
       out graphs and quotes without context and using them to tell the
       story they want instead of what the data actually says.

       This is an irresponsible article: you’re taking a data set on the
       cooling of solely the outermost ring of the atmosphere and, without
       proof, correlating it to surface temperatures (which data shows are
       currently rising). Honestly, I think it’s reasonable to think this
       data MIGHT eventually mean cooling surface temperatures, but
       pretending the outer atmosphere and the earth’s surface are the
       same is unhelpful. I read the original article by Dr. Phillips and
       nowhere is there data correlated surface cooling. You also
       conveniently leave out other data sets that show oceanic heating
       and the relevant effects on surface conditions from warmer ocean
       temps.

       And of course if 0.85 +/- 0.5 degC in 150-200 years is so called
       Global Warming then cooling will be likewise maybe -0.85 +/-0.5degC
       if anyone can detect that at at.

       I am not a scientist but read th article and do not understand how
       a closed system gets smaller (atmosphere) and gets colder, if we
       use that same theory in heat – metal transfer, we will have reduced
       pressure in a closed mechanical device, similar to using a 2 liter
       cooking pot with a lid rather than a 5 liter cooking pot with lid.
       So is it plausible that since the atmosphere is contracting
       (remember the pots above) that are atmosphere will actually heat up
       by 15 – 20 %, to replicate in lab, get two pressure cookers, 1
       liter of water, 1 2 liter pot, 1 5 liter pot, using same heat
       source and temperature, what s the amount of time to get to 100
       degrees Celsius, the heat from the sun is a constant

       The article went on to say ‘be aware that the thermosphere is very
       far above us – 100 +km. Just because the rarefied air up there is
       cooling off, doesn’t mean Earth’s surface is getting colder’. Then
       it goes on to say in capital letters ‘NOT YET, at least’. I think
       the writer is sitting on the fence a little bit. Also, we know that
       we’re already in a cooling phase. But it’s still great to see that
       someone is doing proper research, not just using computer models.

       Michael Rhoads: I was looking for the same correlation. Since there
       is little mixing between the atmospheric layers, I am not clear how
       this would impact the climate of the troposphere. I did some
       searching out on the net and can’t find anything that relates the
       thermosphere’s climate changes impact on climate change in the
       troposphere. However; I thinks it is fair to say that changes in
       the sun’s energy emissions would, if not similarly, impact all the
       layers of the atmosphere in some manner.

       Son of the Sun: I did not read that the change in atmosphere was
       caused by the entire atmosphere (all the layers) contracting. If
       the thermosphere is the only layer that contracts, the overall
       diameter of the atmosphere would change just the same. In fact, the
       article implies that the variations of the Thermosphere is the
       primary reason our atmosphere changing size.
       “Sunspots have been absent for most of 2018 and Earth’s upper
       atmosphere is responding, says Phillips, editor of
       spaceweather.com. Data from NASA’s TIMED satellite show that the
       thermosphere (the uppermost layer of air around our planet) is
       cooling and shrinking, literally decreasing the radius of the
       atmosphere.”
       While not clear, I believe Mr. Mlynxzak’s statement that “ set a
       Space Age record” only applies to the Thermosphere.

       do it QUICKLY, because it is going to be removed from Google soon.
       You can also go to http://www.AmericanPolicy.org and read about it

       by man (numbers from the IPCC) which includes all fossil fuels,
       autos, planes, breathing, electricity production, etc. So if we
       spend trillions of dollars on carbon reduction and reduce man
       caused by one third; we will have reduced carbon production by 1%.
       At the most man caused carbon can only affect temps by a tenth of a
       degree or two.
