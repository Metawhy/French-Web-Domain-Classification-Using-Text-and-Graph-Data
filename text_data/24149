Castle Pinata

   These are simple steps to make a castle piñata for a birthday party.
   In this days we have different techniques to create a piñata, you can
   do with the basic elements like news paper, glue and tissue paper,
   exist also different glues like hot glue and other type of glue that
   people been use.
   [castle-pinata-800X800.jpg]
   Materials:
   Cardboard box rectangular (the sizes can depended of how big you want
   hem)
   Corrugated roll (if don’t have you can use a cardboard box)
   Construction paper
   Tissue paper two colors
   Scissors
   Glue
   Sponge brush
   Tape
   Rope
   Knife
               In the rectangular box, make holes in the sides of the box,
   and insert the rope from one side to the other making a cross, and in
   the tap make the holes and pas the rope to and you form the handle to
   hang the piñata; and close the box with tape.
   With the corrugated roll (or the cardboard box*), measure the size of
   the rectangular box and left an extra peace to attach to the box wit
   tape; you will do the same to the other size.
   * if you use the card board make couple cuts in the are that will bee
   inside so you can give the round form.
   After attach the sides to the castle, you need to close the bottom of
   the sides wit cardboard; trace the shape and cut, you en clue or tape.
   For the top, with the construction paper you make the cone that fit in
   the open en glue them.
   The details of the windows and the door you can make them with black
   construction paper if you want to put flags in the towers, you can do
   them with a toothpick and a triangle construction paper.
   With the tissue paper you will cut them in strips of 5 in. and make
   also the cut vertical (see the picture)
   The quantity needed will depend on how big is the piñata. You may want
   help in that part or cut enough and save the left over
   Now that the shape is form, the windows and the door are glue to the
   castle; we star to decorate with the tissue paper. With the sponge
   brush apply glue directly to the cardboard and start applies the tissue
   paper going around the piñata.
   For the bottom you can use a sheet o two you just glue them to cover
   When you finish to wrap the piñata with the tissue paper, you need make
   the hole to put the candies

napking paper flowers

   Valentines is around the corner, between work kids and hubby I been do
   a little crafts, I start with this napkin flowers.
   The flowers are super easy to do, I saw last year the tutorial in dana
   made it, and I make some for my little girl birthday party.
   [IMG_3405.JPG]
   [IMG_3378.JPG]
   To make the napkin flowers you will need:
   - Napkins (you can buy in the dollar store)
   - Pipe cleaner
   - Scissors
   [IMG_3379.JPG]
   First you unfold 4 napkins of the same color, for the center I use
   something that contrast, but cut the border of this so get a little
   smile, how I show in the picture below
   [IMG_3381.JPG]
   [IMG_3383.JPG]
   When you have your napkins together you star to fold all of them about
   an inch each fold to form a fan
   [IMG_3384.JPG]
   In the middle you will tied it with the pipe cleaner, you can use
   string also.
   [IMG_3385.JPG]
   After you tide it, cut the ends to give the shape
   [IMG_3386.JPG] [IMG_3387.JPG]


   Now you open the petals and give the shape
   [IMG_3402.JPG]
   And it is done
   [IMG_3405.JPG]

   Here is one of the places I put this flowers

Valentine mobile

   Yesterday my honey wants to go to big lots! Store, I went with him and
   found this stickers (was a good deal because the bag come with 6 packs)
   and I only pay $1.00 for it; I like the shapes and the sparkles and
   this is what come in my mind.
     [IMG_3399.JPG]
    My Valentine mobile . . .
   [IMG_3389.JPG]
   ﻿
   For this I use:
   - Stickers (you can cut the hearts in felt or paper)
   - Embroidery hoops
   - fishing line
   - Pom-poms
   - Ribbon
   [IMG_3391.JPG]
   First I wrap the ribbon around one of the embroidery hoop and put it
   aside. After I measured the lent of my mobile and left like 20 to 25
   inches for tide it to the embroidery hoop
   [IMG_3393.JPG]
   [IMG_3392.JPG]
   With my strip already cut, take the stickers, and put two of the same
   in between the stickers, add a pom poms and sticker, you create your
   own pattern; when you done you can tide them in the embroidery hoop
   with the rest of the fishing line, pull all together in the center to
   make the loop to hang it, and you are done
   [IMG_3399.JPG]
   hope you enjoy . . .

Valentine wreath

   This past weekend, I was working on my Valentine wreath for my door, I
   get a little busy between my work and my home, but always I make time
   to craft something.

   [IMG_3357.JPG]




   I star wrapping around the heart shape with tulle
   [IMG_3360.JPG]
   Next I make my flowers; you can find the tutorial here, they are super
   easy to do.
   [IMG_3361.JPG]
   Now you can star ensemble the wreath, if you use brass, just pin the
   flower to the foam heart shape, if you use buttons you can glue them
   in.
   [IMG_3369.JPG]
   In the back I pin the ribbon, to make a bow and hang it  in my door.
   [IMG_3377.JPG]
   hope you enjoy . . .

Prima Flower

   My mom was looking in the web, and sends me a picture of a flower and
   asks me if I can do it.
   ﻿﻿﻿﻿
   [IMG_3315.JPG]
   They call it prima flowers
   For this flower you will need:
   - Tulle any color
   - Scissors
   - Tea candle with a glass
   - Tweezers
   - Brass
   [IMG_3307.JPG]

    first of all you need to determine what size of flower you want,  for
     this I use a 3" circles you need about 7 and a bras, you can use a
   plain brass or decorative, if you use plain you can put on tap a pretty
                              jewelry or button

   [IMG_3308.JPG]
                             [IMG_3309.JPG]
   After you cut your circles, you folded in a 1/4, and hold them with
   your tweezers, how I show you in the picture
   [IMG_3310.JPG]

   light up your candle, and get close the tulle, only need the warm, not
    direct to the flame, (tulle burn real easy), recommended you try one
   first, can a rotate it around, to the ends of the circles get crispy a
                                 little bit.

   [IMG_3312.JPG]
   The circles my glue together but don’t worry, jus take them apart and
   unfold it. When you done with all the circles it is time to ensemble
   the flower
   [IMG_3313.JPG]

       You will star overlapping each circle (I use 7 circles for this
   flower), when you finish, use the brass in the middle, and open it, you
      can use a gem or a button to give different finish; and is done.
