INFORMATION NOTICE – COOKIES

   Audiens, as Data Controller, informs the users on its use of cookies.
   When a user visits our website, we send cookies that are stored by the
   browser on the user’s device. Cookies are small text files that are
   sent by our website; they are stored in the user’s terminal equipment
   to be then re-transmitted to the websites on the user’s subsequent
   visits to our website. The cookies sent by our website www.audiens.com
   are only technical cookies, and the user’s prior consent to these
   cookies is not required.
     * Technical cookies.

   Technical cookies are cookies used   exclusively with a view to
   “carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic
   communications network, insofar as this is strictly necessary to the
   provider of an information society service that has been explicitly
   requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said
   service.” (see Section 122(1) of the Italian Data Protection Code).
   They are not used for further purposes and are usually installed
   directly by the data controller or the website manager.

   They can be divided into three categories:
     * browsing or session cookies, which allow users to navigate and use
       a website (e.g. to purchase items online or authenticate themselves
       to access certain sections;
     * analytics cookies, which can be equated to technical cookies
       insofar as they are used directly by the website manager to collect
       aggregate information on the number of visitors and the pattern of
       visits to the website;
     * functional cookies, which allow users to navigate as a function of
       certain pre-determined criteria, such as language or products
       purchased, with the aim   to improve the quality of the website’

   The user acknowledges that his prior consent is not required to install
   these cookies and that the subsequent collection of personal data is
   essential for the use of the website.

    ON OUR WEBSITE WE USE THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL COOKIES:

Name of the Cookies

Category of cookie (a, b, c)

     * Profiling Cookies

   PLEASE NOTE: this section of our information notice is meant to inform
   only the users who have been forwarded to this page through an
   hyperlink placed on a privacy information notice present in the website
   of one of our customer.

   The purpose of profiling cookies that we may use is the following: the
   cookie that we install is used to track the web surfing of the user, in
   order to define the so-called “profile of interest” of the user, based
   on the searches made and the pages visited. These information pages are
   associated to a unique identifier and are ranked with our proprietary
   technology; in this way they help us define the profile of such
   identifier.

INFORMATION SHARING

   These data are subsequently processed by a statistical engine and are
   used to send marketing and promotional information, and in general to
   send you specific materials of interest for you. The cookie we use is:
   visitor_id, that we use to keep track and store information like
   technical characteristics of the device used, time of browsing, URL
   browsed, actions like clicking on banners or other parts of the URL. We
   then process these data with statistical techniques.

   When possible, technical data may be enriched with demographic
   information collected from third-party companies such as Mobile Network
   Operators.

   Audiens may share aggregate, non-personal information with targeted
   publishers, display publishers, and networks in connection with
   reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third
   parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational
   analysis.

   We may also work with other advertising service providers who help
   tailor ads on behalf of us and others. Some of those ads may be
   personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you
   based on information advertising providers collect about your visits to
   this site and elsewhere over time.

   If you do not consent to our use of such cookie, please click on the “I
   DON’T ACCEPT” box. There will be no consequences in such case, but you
   must be aware that the browsing of the original website that linked you
   here may be partially impacted and some of its functions may not be
   available. If you accept the installation of the cookie by continuing
   the surfing of the website, the data collected through the cookies will
   be used with IT technology by the Data Controller, by the employees in
   charge of the maintenance and management of the website, and in general
   by all employees (including where applicable, employees of third
   parties, such as ourselves and other subcontractors) who are involved
   in the website’s operations and management. All such third parties have
   been duly appointed as Data processor. The list of our Data processor
   is available, by request, by sending an email to privacy@audiens .com.

   Users may exercise their statutory rights provided for by section 7 of
   Legislative Decree 196/2003 (the Italian data protection law) such as,
   for example, the right to access their personal data and the right to
   require their correction, modification, integration and, in the cases
   provided for under the Law, their blocking or erasing.
