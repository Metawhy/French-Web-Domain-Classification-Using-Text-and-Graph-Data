About Biomunex

   BIOMUNEX is a French biopharmaceutical company, founded in 2014 in
   Paris, focused on the discovery and development of innovative
   bispecific antibody therapeutics, based on a proprietary platform, to
   address unmet medical needs.
     * Based on its unique proprietary platform, BIOMUNEX is developing
       cutting-edge immunotherapies for several cancer types. Its ‘Plug
       and Play’ modular bispecific antibody BiXAb platform enables
       BIOMUNEX to develop drug candidates with high anti-tumor potential,
       superior manufacturability and optimal drug-like properties.
     * The BiXAb platform can also generate innovative bispecific
       antibodies in any other therapeutic areas, such as immune-mediated
       inflammatory diseases or infectious diseases or any other diseases
       in which therapeutic bispecific antibodies may provide benefit.
     * The most advanced candidate derived from BIOMUNEX’ platform,
       BMX-002, has demonstrated superior in vivo efficacy in pancreatic
       cancer, one of the most lethal cancers. Initial preclinical studies
       have proven its potential to become a breakthrough therapy in
       several solid tumors such as head & neck, gastric or colon cancers.
     * The BIOMUNEX 2^nd lead candidate, BMX-101, an immunotherapeutic
       being developed for multiple myeloma and other hematological
       malignancies, leverages the power of immune checkpoint inhibition.
     * Research programs are ongoing with renowned academic teams, such as
       Institut de Recherche en Cancérologie de Montpellier; new programs
       are being established with additional academic teams.
     * The management team is represented by an experienced group of
       international managers and drug developers from the pharmaceutical
       and biotech industries, with extensive scientific expertise in
       oncology.
