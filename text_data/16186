Pool Party Petit Fours

   6/8/2015

   Pool Party Petit Fours

   Pool party season is UPON US! Hallelujah. Break out the pool floats,
   bust out the beach balls and whip up some‚Ä¶ petit fours? Yep. I know
   these French little treats are typically thought of for tea time
   (Pinkies up!) but you know how I like to turn things on their head! So,
   we made some pool party petit fours!! And we teamed up with Yulu, an
   Australian-style yogurt company that makes deliciously smooth, packed
   with protein yogurt to give these tiny cakes quite a spectacular ZING!
   We‚Äôve got the petit four recipe and a tutorial for making fondant
   versions of everyone‚Äôs favorite pool floaties to top them with today!
   These little dudes are the perfect pick-up and run (swim?) dessert for
   your summer par-tays.

   Pool Party Petit Fours

   Click through for the recipe + tutorial!

   Pool Party Petit Fours

   ingredients
   Makes about 25 petit fours
   For the yogurt cake:
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
   1 cup sugar
   3 eggs
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
   1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)

   1 1/2 cups flour
   2 teaspoons baking powder
   1/2 teaspoon salt
   2 5.3 ounce containers of Yulu Aussie Style Yogurt (about 1 cup)
   1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
   2. Grease and flour two 8 inch pans. Square if you have them, but
   circle works just fine as you can trim the edges later. Line the
   bottoms with parchment.
   3. Cream together the butter and the sugar. Add in the eggs, one at a
   time, incorporating after each one. Scrapes the sides of the bowl. Add
   in the vanilla extract, almond extract and Yulu yogurt. Combine.
   4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and
   salt. Add into the wet ingredients and mix just until combined.
   5. Divide batter evenly between the 2 pans. Bake in preheated oven for
   about 40 minutes, till the top is lightly browned.
   6. Let cool in the pans for at least 10 minutes. Remove from pans and
   let cool completely.
   7. Cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.

   ingredients
   For the yogurt icing:
   6 cups powdered sugar
   2 5.3 ounce containers of Yulu Aussie Style Yogurt (about 1 cup)
   1 to 2 tablespoons of milk (if needed)
   1. Whisk together the powdered sugar and the yogurt till smooth. Add in
   the milk if necessary. The icing needs to be thick enough to coat the
   petit fours but thin enough to fall evenly over them in a smooth layer.
   2. Align cake squares onto a wire rack placed over a cookie sheet. Pour
   about 3 tablespoons of icing over each petit four, making sure all
   edges and corners are covered. Repeat till all cake squares are coated.
   Let sit for 5 minutes and give the cake squares a second coat. When you
   have used up all of the icing, scrape the used icing from the cookie
   sheet and pour through a fine mesh sieve to remove crumbs and reuse.
   3. Let the petit fours sit for at least 3 hours, up to overnight in the
   fridge.
   4. To decorate, use gel food coloring mixed with almond extract as
   paint. Use more extract for pale colors. For more concentrated colors,
   use less almond extract. The softer the brush, the better for painting
   the delicate petit fours. We used blue, pink and then did some stripe
   cabana towel ones. The color will set in about 30 minutes.
   5. Top the blue petit fours with fondant pool float figurines (tutorial
   below!) or edible letters.

   Fondant
   Gel Food Coloring
   Quilling Tool
   Paint Brush
   Toothpicks

   1. Roll a small ball of pink-dyed fondant and flatten it slightly into
   a plump circle. Use the lid of your food coloring to press a smaller
   circle indent into the top of it.
   2. Use the very end of the quilling tool to draw an indent all around
   the outside of the fondant circle. Then make crosshatches all along the
   line, to look like the puckers of an inflated pool float.
   3. Pinch a little tear drop shape of fondant for the tail and adhere to
   one side of the circle.
   4. Flatten two small balls of fondant and cut out a zig zag, as shown,
   to form each wing. You can do the crosshatches along the edge of those
   as well.
   5. Cut off the ends, about 1/2‚Ä≥, of two toothpicks and stick them,
   point side out, into the opposite end of the tail and on either side.
   Push one of the wings onto each side toothpick.
   6. Roll out a snake of pink fondant and curve it to form the flamingo‚Äôs
   head. Add a small piece of white fondant to the end for the beak.
   7. Slip the neck onto the final toothpick and use two bottles of food
   coloring to hold it in place until set.
   8. Once set, use black food coloring to draw in detail on the
   flamingo‚Äôs beak and draw in eyes.

   If you haven‚Äôt tried Australian-style yogurt on it‚Äôs own, you must! I
   think I‚Äôm an official convert. And it‚Äôs just a bonus that it‚Äôs perfect
   to bake with! A bonus that involves tiny cakes and pool floats. I love
   bonuses like that. Happy pool party-ing!

   This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Yulu. The
   opinions and text are all mine.

DIY ‚ÄúWink Wink‚Äù Mani Tutorial

   DIY Wink Wink Mani Tutorial

   I told you I wanted to keep expanding the topics covered here this
   year‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm following through! I‚Äôm excited to start bringing you more
   manicure tutorials! HOORAY! Especially when they look as good as this
   one‚Ä¶ wink wink! This mani is surprisingly easier than it looks, and the
   full how-to is below! Plus, BONUS! To get prepped for more beauty
   content in 2015, I teamed up with Target to get a fancy-pants,
   organized vanity working in the studio!

   DIY Wink Wink Manicure
   Bathroom Vanity Essentials

   Since I‚Äôm hoping to do more beauty shoots this year, I gave a corner of
   the studio a little makeover to create a vanity! Little containers with
   nail supplies, a toothbrush holder to hold makeup brushes, a mirror
   (FINALLY!) and a few other things to keep us from running down the hall
   to the bathroom 45 times during a shoot! I‚Äôm pretty jazzed about how it
   turned out. Here‚Äôs my vanity essentials:

   Hand Towel / Large Oilcan Bath Canister / Small Oilcan Bath Canister /
   Toothbrush Holder / Soap Dispenser / Pedestal Bowl / White Mirror

   Bathroom Vanity Essentials

   Now, that I‚Äôm all organized, about these nails‚Ä¶ Eyes are everywhere.
   Like, literally. They seem to be quite the trend now. Are eyes the next
   pineapple!? üòâ I‚Äôm on board. So Alex stepped in again to create a flirty
   little ‚Äúwink wink‚Äù manicure that I am OBSESSED with! Lashes for days,
   folks. Let‚Äôs get to it.

       Okay, initially when I scrolled down, I saw all the fake eyelashes
       and panicked because I thought you were going to be gluing falsies
       to your nails.
       *ahhhh, hairy nails?!*
       I scrolled back up (crisis averted) and I actually love this! I
       remember seeing something similar to this a while back and I think
       I might have even pinned something like this once! Seems easy
       enough that I just might be able to do it üôÇ What a fun tutorial
       you‚Äôve put together! Love it!

       I love this manicure DIY tutorial! I saw the picture that you
       posted on Instagram and immediately headed over to the blog to see
       how I could accomplish this myself. Haha! This is a great post, and
       I‚Äôm really looking forward to more ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù and manicure tutorials
       in 2015.
