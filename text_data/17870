   Triangle Borea Loudspeaker Series
   Triangle's new Borea loudspeaker series offers excellent value (€319 to
   €1199 per pair) combined with comprehensive experience in acoustic
   design. These speakers are aimed towards discerning audiophiles, with a
   wide range of solutions for virtually any listening room and / or home

   dome drive unit known for its neutrality, with a phase plug developed
   specifically to homogenize high-frequency diffusion. This system is
   said to significantly reduce the directivity regardless of your
   listening location in the room. Midrange driver is made with a membrane
   of 100% natural cellulose paper. On the three-way floorstander, the
   midrange driver incorporates a small pleat peripheral short-travel
   suspension, which Triangle is known for.

   Merrill Audio Element 118 Solid-State Monoblock Amplifier Review

   World Premiere Review!
   Merrill Audio Element 118 Monoblock Amplifiers
   A transparent, powerful, refined, good looking, but admittedly pricey
   brute.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   The Element 118 monoblocks are Merrill Audio's newest products. I read
   about them long before I received my review samples, so I already knew
   that they are the most ambitious components that Merrill Audio has ever
   produced. They are named Element 118 after Oganesson, the newest
   element in the periodic table. Merrill Audio used this for the name of
   their amplifier because it "reflects the newest in technologies in the
   Element 118".

   Hi-Fi World November 2019

   Hi-Fi World November Features Reviews & Think Pieces
   Hi-Fi World's November 2019 issue features a contest with your chance
   to win a World Designs Pre3cf valve preamplifier kit worth £929.
   High-end audio equipment reviews include Bowers & Wilkins Formation Duo
   loudspeakers, Naim Mu-so 2 second generation speaker, Spendor D7.2
   loudspeakers, Pow Audio Mo Bluetooth speaker, Cowon Audio Iaudio I-Fi
   Hi-Res player, Tellurium Q Ultra Black Ii loudspeaker cables, Mcru No.7
   Mains Cable, Rotel A11 amplifier, Charisma Audio Musiko MM/MC phono
   stage, and Origin Live Cartridge Enabler.

   Within his editorial, Noel Keywood says, "How do you decide what to
   choose? This month we bring you an almost bewildering option – the
   fantastically modern Bowers & Wilkins Formation Duo loudspeakers
   (£3500) on p10 that demand a Roon music server and an iPhone or iPad as
   a means of control, or the traditional but superb Spendor D7.2
   loudspeakers. The Formation Duos may seem expensive but their price
   includes amplifiers, making them an all-in-one streaming system. Yet
   you need an iDevice and – say – a £400 lifetime Roon subscription to
   make it all work." See what's within this issue of Hi-Fi World at this

   reviews of Conrad-Johnson HVA-1 valve headphone amplifier, Warwick
   Acoustics Aperio electrostatic headphone system, and Auris Audio
   Euterpe valve headphone amplifier / DAC.

   Alan Sircom's editorial within the October 2019 issue of Hi-Fi+ says,
   "The changing face of audio was brought home to me recently. I met with
   a friend who got into audio in the 1980s and then stopped. His system –
   still very well maintained and working correctly – reminded me of my
   first 'real' audio system in the late 1980s; a Linn LP12, a small
   'chrome bumper' Naim preamplifier / power amplifier, and a pair of Linn
   Kan loudspeakers. While such systems still sound good, what's
   interesting is how far we've gone in other directions since." See

   Ear Jewelry For Audiophiles

   Ear Jewelry For Audiophiles
   Roger Skoff writes about the state of the 'art' in Hi-Fi.
   Article By Roger Skoff
   Have you seen what some of the latest, ultimate, super-duper High-End
   turntables look like? To me, they're reminiscent of what the "cities of
   the future" looked like in those old Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon movie
   serials of the 1930s and 1940s – great networks of massive gleaming
   towers, all surrounded and interconnected by loops and swirls of the
   aerial highways predicted by the people back then to be the roads for
   the flying cars of the future.

   Audio Analogue Maestro Anniversary Integrated Amplifier Review

   Audio Analogue Maestro Anniversary Int. Amplifier
   A sonic wolf in sheep's clothing.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   When I was asked if I would like to review Audio Analogue's newest
   integrated amplifier, I exclaimed "Yes!". Why? Because even on paper it
   seemed as if it was an extremely well-designed integrated amplifier,
   and also could easily power my reference speakers with a healthy 150
   Watts per channel into 8 Ohms, its power doubling each time its
   impedance load is halved – and besides all this, I love equipment
   that's made in Italy. Even if some of this gear isn't a perfect match
   for the system in which it would be auditioned, I never have been
   disappointed in the sound quality of any of those components.

   Kharma Elegance dB7-S Floorstanding Speakers Review

   Kharma Elegance dB7-S Floorstanding Speakers
   Gorgeous looks... and they look as good as they sound.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Let's be clear. Kharma Elegance dB7-Sare not the largest or the most
   expensive high-end loudspeakers one can buy. They aren't even the
   largest or most expensive speakers in the line that they are a part of.
   But they are gorgeous high-end speakers that sound as good as they
   look, and obviously designed, built, and are intended to be included in
   the best high-end audio systems that are owned by those that consider
   themselves to be discriminating audiophiles. One can place them into an
   existing system, or one can build a fine system around these speakers.

   LampizatOr Golden Gate 2 DAC Review

   LampizatOr Golden Gate 2 DAC
   An accurate and unfettered music source for my system.
   Review By Matthew Clott
   Vacuum tubes versus solid-state are the Audiophile's version of red
   versus white wine. Both are lovely and both have die-hard fans and
   haters alike. I don't buy into either club completely, and I don't want
   to start the next Vacuum Tube Versus Solid-State war. I have enjoyed
   and currently own both tube and solid-state gear, and use both for
   reviews. That said, years ago I developed an aversion to tubes in my
   DAC's, partly due to experience and partly due to unsubstantiated
   personal bias (hey, at least I'm honest!).

   LampizatOr Amber III (DAC) Review

   World Premiere Review!
   LampizatOr Amber III (DAC)
   Fall in love with your music all over again.
   Review By Dave Hanson
   It's one thing to create a component that listeners can appreciate.
   It's quite another to create a component that makes listeners
   appreciate their music even more. For me, the LampizatOr Amber III
   digital to analog converter ($2750 on up depending on options) falls
   into the latter category, quite decisively, in fact. It's a component
   that reintroduces you to your music, and it produces love at first

   Quiescent Mains Cable Loom Review

   Quiescent Mains Cable Loom
   The concept of vibration control in signal-carrying cables is a
   relatively well understood, but can the same factors affect a system
   via its mains cable?
   Review By Kevin Fiske Of HIFICRITIC
   Following my positive reviews in HIFICRITIC of the Quiescent
   Technologies Peak Speaker Cables (Vol. 12/2) and Peak Interconnect
   (Vol. 12/3) I was invited by the company to try its more costly Apex
   Interconnect. However, in my system the Apex sounded too fat in the
   bass and rather sluggish. I preferred the Peak. Quiescent's Steve
   Elford suspected my mains loom. Could one of his colleagues bring a
   selection of Quiescent – formerly Vertex AQ – mains products to try in
   my system?

   Sonus faber Olympica @ World Of McIntosh NYC
   A good high-end system is akin to a time machine.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Last year I took a tour of World Of McIntosh, a very impressive
   five-story luxury townhouse in the Soho neighborhood of downtown New
   York City. World Of McIntosh is an amazing place, packed with working
   audio systems featuring gear from McIntosh, Sonus faber, Pro-Ject Audio
   Systems, Audio Research, and more. This luxurious space is used as an
   event space, for invitation only audio tours, and for anything else one
   who wants to use a space "where music and design are merged in a way
   that's striking, memorable, and undeniably enjoyable".

   Audiovector Introduces Their New R Series Speakers

   Audiovector Introduces Their New R Series Speakers
   Audiovector has been designing speakers for over 40 years, and their
   new R Series brings together their longstanding knowledge combined with
   handcraftsmanship. Audiovector's Freedom Grounding system eliminates
   distortion, improves overtones, lowers the noise floor, plus it
   increases image depth and focus according to the company. This
   technique routes away the motion-induced distortion between the drive
   units and increases control, resolution and micro dynamics. Separate
   grounding circuits connects from the loudspeaker driver to the ground
   terminal of your power distributor via the Schuko connector. All models
   include carbon fiber drivers for midrange / bass mated with an AMT
   Arrete tweeter.

   All R-series speakers use a tilted plinth to avoid undesirable standing
   waves within the cabinet. Audiovector plinths have a built-in steel
   spring holding the spikes to rid the speakers from the mass of the
   floor. The R-series will all be available in the standard matte colors
   Italian Walnut, African Rosewood, Black Ash and White Silk. Custom
   piano colors are available on request. Black cloth grille is included
   with all speakers.

   The Frog MC Phono Cartridge
   Smooth and soothing sounds for vinyl lovers.
   Review By Steven R. Rochlin
   Over the past five years i have been fortunate enough to avoid the
   digital wars. Let the other guys deal with DVD-Audio, SACD, HD DVD and
   Blu-ray as i sit back and enjoy my 8000+ and growing vinyl collection.
   Almost a year ago my review of the Oracle Delphi MK V turntable with
   Oracle-SME 345 tonearm proved that vinyl indeed has much to offer music
   lovers worldwide. While attending the recent Munich High End show
   (2007), i was chatting with Aalt Jouk van den Hul (A.J.) at some press
   event for another manufacturer. Have known A.J. for well over a decade,
   as he attends many shows, and we have sat down and enjoyed some nice
   conversations about music, audio equipment... whatever.

   McIntosh Announces MC257 Seven-Channel Amplifier

   McIntosh Announces MC257 Seven-Channel Amplifier
   McIntosh is proud to announce their MC257 seven-channel tri-amplified
   +1 / home theater power amplifier ($10,000). Bringing both
   tri-amplification for loudspeakers and / or home theater dreams to
   life, the MC257 produces 200 Watts per channel when all seven channels
   being used. Naturally the front panel is highlighted by McIntosh's new
   eye-catching TripleView Power Output Meter that independently indicates
   the real time power reading of the amplifier's three main channels.

   In addition to the new TripleView meter, the MC257 features many other
   upgrades. When using just the front left, center and right channels,
   power output has been increased by 25% from 200 Watts per channel to
   250 Watts per channel. When using all seven channels, each will receive
   a healthy 200 Watts per channel. Regardless of how many channels are
   used, the full 200 or 250 Watts is delivered to either 4 or 8 Ohm
   speakers via McIntosh's Dynamic Power Manager (DPM) technology. Filter
   capacity has been increased by 20% over previous models. Dynamic
   headroom has increased from 1.7dB to 3.3dB as well. Analog input is vis
   balanced XLR or unbalanced RCA, with speaker wire outputs via
   McIntosh's custom gold-plated binding posts.

   driver with 300 Watt bi-amplification to ensure timing accuracy and an
   abundance of power. A front-firing bass port design allows for
   near-wall placement and ensures optimal low frequency performance.
   Their next generation Gold 5 with 5" driver features a 0.75" titanium
   tweeter with Tulip waveguide. The Gold 7 and Gold 8 have a 6.5" and 8"
   driver (respectively), with both drivers featuring a 1" titanium
   tweeter with Tulip waveguide centrally-mounted. When used in pairs, the
   new Tannoy Gold loudspeakers are said to produce detailed stereo image
   with very wide sweet spot.

   Class AB amplification is transducer-matched for both LF and HF
   bi-amplification. Continually-active XLR and TRS phone jack inputs let
   you connect up to two audio sources. Dedicated input trim from 0 to -12
   and high frequency adjustment from -2 to +2 let you optimize the audio
   for your listening conditions. There's a switch to select 0, -2, and
   -4dB bass EQ adjustment to further ensure the speaker integrates well
   within your listening space.

   HIFICRITIC Volume 13 Number 2 April / May / June 2019

   HIFICRITIC's Latest Issue Features Articles & Reviews
   HIFICRITIC's latest issue features Stan's Safari No 46 in which Stan
   Curtis explains how failing hearing is no obstacle to the ability to
   carry on enjoying music. Passing Notes 8 has Julian Musgrave explaining
   why he's an SACD devotee, extols the virtues of a good subwoofer, and
   is blindsided by a pair of over-performing DIY speakers. Synchronicity
   And Serendipity has Andrew Everard saying there's a lot of received
   wisdom involved in the world of Hi-Fi: things accepted as being facts
   just because – well, just because they've always been so, and as a
   result are beyond challenge.

   Gear reviews include ATC SCM50 ASL studio-derived active monitor, ATC'S
   'Starter System', Goldmund Telos 590 Nextgen integrated amplifier,
   Melco N10 & N100 Digital Music Libraries, Audio Note TT3 three-motor
   turntable, various headphone surprises, Chord Hugo TT2 and M Scaler,
   Atoll Electronique CD200 Signature, DAC300, IN200 Signature and IN300.
   Also reviewed within this issue are Quiescent Mains Cable Loom, Q
   Acoustic Concept 300 standmount speakers, Nain Supernait 3 integrated
   amplifier, NAD M10 network audio system, Mytek Digital Manhattan II,
   plus integrated amplifiers including the Hegel H390, Krell K-300i and
   the Mark Levinson N^o 5805.

   Within Martin Colloms editorial, he says "Somehow the UK managed to
   vote for leaving the European Union (EU), and as I write this around
   August Bank Holiday it looks possible it may occur without an exit
   agreement, so the United Kingdom (UK) audio business is hoping for the
   best. Much of our audio is China made and will continue to be imported.
   The UK may levy additional import taxes on European equipment while EU
   tariffs may impact price and availability of electronic components.
   Production schedules and costs are already impacted, as some of these
   parts are already scarce and certainly more expensive." See what's
   within this issue of HIFICRITIC at this link.

   Analogue Artisan A1 Series Turntable With Remote Control VTA/SRA
   Mongoose Tonearm And Pod Review

   Analogue Artisan A1 Series Turntable
   Remote VTA / SRA Mongoose Tonearm & Pod
   Truly reference sound quality with astonishingly low distortion.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Brian Calaio, the owner and chief engineer of Analogue Artisan and I
   have two things in common. The first is our love of music; the second
   is that we both believe that once a high-end audio system gets to a
   certain level of refinement, everything contributes to the sound of the
   system. The problem is that if the manufacturer of a component believes
   that everything makes a difference, and designs equipment with that
   maxim in mind with no regards for price, things can get a bit hairy,
   that is, very expensive.

   Quiescent Mains Cable Loom Review

   Quiescent Mains Cable Loom
   The concept of vibration control in signal-carrying cables is a
   relatively well understood, but can the same factors affect a system
   via its mains cable?
   Review By Kevin Fiske Of HIFICRITIC
   Following my positive reviews in HIFICRITIC of the Quiescent
   Technologies Peak Speaker Cables (Vol. 12/2) and Peak Interconnect
   (Vol. 12/3) I was invited by the company to try its more costly Apex
   Interconnect. However, in my system the Apex sounded too fat in the
   bass and rather sluggish. I preferred the Peak. Quiescent's Steve
   Elford suspected my mains loom. Could one of his colleagues bring a
   selection of Quiescent – formerly Vertex AQ – mains products to try in
   my system?

   Synchronicity And Serendipity

   Synchronicity And Serendipity
   Synchronicity and serendipity took this issue of HIFICRITIC and turned
   it into a de facto celebration and turned it into a de facto
   celebration...
   Article By Andrew Everard Of HIFICRITIC
   There's a lot of received wisdom involved in the world of Hi-Fi: things
   accepted as being facts just because – well, just because they've
   always been so, and as a result are beyond challenge. It's a nice, cozy
   way of thinking, taking in all sorts of myths and legends built up over
   the years, such as 'source first', 'analogue is always best', and 'the
   more boxes the better'.

   Jensen C12-K 100 Watt 12" Loudspeaker Driver

   Jensen C12-K 100 Watt 12" Loudspeaker Driver
   Jensen's new C12K-2 12" loudspeaker driver provides a modern British
   voice in a vintage American package. This high-power 100 Watt handling
   capability speaker features a low-end punch with a warm, rich mid-range
   and smooth articulate highs. This speaker is not only capable of
   handling high levels of overdrive and distortion, but is also capable
   of achieving clarity and detailed response with those sounds says the
   company. The C12K-2 can beautifully produce the complex and nuanced
   tones of vintage and boutique amplifiers and is available in both 8 and
   16 Ohm nominal impedance. Resonant frequency for the 8 Ohm version is
   79Hz, with the 16 Ohm being 85Hz. Cone material is paper, voice coil is
   Nomex, and wire winding is copper. An integrated paper surround,
   non-treated cloth dome, pressed sheet metal basket, and ferrite magnet
   round out this design.

   TACET's real surround sound Mozart Violin Concertos KV 207 & KV 219
   (€21.47) on hybrid SACD features the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra.
   With Gordan Nikolić on violin, this new music release features
   inspiring "vacuum tube sound" and presented in stereo for CD and 5.1
   24-bit/96kHz 5.1 channel surround sound on the SACD layer. The
   orchestra including the soloist sitting within a big circle around the
   microphones. Gordan Nikolić, soloist and leader of the recording,
   delivers his musical expertise and feels entirely at home with Mozart.
   His love for the crazy things within the music aurally shines through.
   While in the fast movements you hear climbing and clambering around on
   the strings like a child at the playground, during slow movements he
   caresses his violin as you would a newborn puppy.

   Amazon Music HD Lossless 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res Music
   And so it finally begins as a mainstream service offers true lossless
   Hi-Res Music. With all due apologies to Qobuz and, to a lesser extent
   Tidal, Amazon Music reaches a massive amount of music lovers globally
   and their new Ultra HD tier ($14.99 a month, $12.99 for Prime members)
   delivers upwards of true lossless 24-bit/192kHz streaming music to
   subscribers. This price is less than what lossless Qobuz, and lower
   quality lossy Tidal, provides today. Amazon claims to already have over
   50 million songs within their High Definition tier, yet keep in mind
   that is CD quality 16-bit/44.1kHz. Of those, there are 10 million songs
   within their Ultra HD tier. Enjoy the Music.com greatly appreciates the
   first mainstream music provider in offering true lossless Hi-Res Music
   streaming services to their customers. Learn more from Amazon at this

   Sonus faber Olympica @ World Of McIntosh NYC

   Sonus faber Olympica @ World Of McIntosh NYC
   A good high-end system is akin to a time machine.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Last year I took a tour of World Of McIntosh, a very impressive
   five-story luxury townhouse in the Soho neighborhood of downtown New
   York City. World Of McIntosh is an amazing place, packed with working
   audio systems featuring gear from McIntosh, Sonus faber, Pro-Ject Audio
   Systems, Audio Research, and more. This luxurious space is used as an
   event space, for invitation only audio tours, and for anything else one
   who wants to use a space "where music and design are merged in a way
   that's striking, memorable, and undeniably enjoyable".

   ZeroHedge Posts About Vinyl Outpacing CDs

   ZeroHedge Posts About Vinyl Outpacing CDs
   ZH down-talks vinyl, backlash ensues.
   Popular online financial and political website ZeroHedge just posted an
   article titled "Vinyl Records Set To Outpace CD Sales For The First
   Time In 30 Years, Even Though They Suck", and the comment sections is
   filled with their longtime readers who push back on the
   less-than-positive article about the sound of vinyl LPs. Within
   magazine Rolling Stone it says, "Vinyl records earned $224.1 million
   (on 8.6 million units) in the first half of 2019, closing in on the
   $247.9 million (on 18.6 million units) generated by CD sales. Vinyl
   revenue grew by 12.8% in the second half of 2018 and 12.9% in the first
   six months of 2019...."
   ZeroHedge follows-up by saying, "My question is, given the amount of
   noise and distortion coming from an age-old source, why invest in a
   great, audiophile-quality amp or preamp? In effect, one is feeding it
   with a distortion-laden source component with poor dynamic range. It's
   tantamount to pumping 50-octane fuel into your new Lamborghini
   Aventador. Perhaps it's time to try out the higher-grade audiophile
   fuel, even if it costs a few bucks more, so that you can realize the
   potential of your music playback system." When vinyl LP sales become an
   article on ZeroHedge, you know there's more to the story. Read the
   comments section of their article, as it is quite enlightening, and
   entertaining too!

   With the ever-growing popularity of whole-house and outdoor audio
   systems, the challenge of unlocking the performance potential of sound
   has only increased. Web-based setup, digital inputs, equalization,

   chassis. Anthem Room Correction (ARC) and bass management further
   extends the capability of their MDA series. Additionally, with both IP

   nuances of music, MDAs accept high-resolution PCM up to 24-bit/192kHz.
   MDAs will never hold back a compelling musical experience.

   channel into 8 Ohms. MDAs are fully configurable using an intuitive
   web-based interface that controls every available setting for every
   zone and every input. It has never been easier to set up a whole-house
   audio system with such extremely accurate results.

   HeadAmp Gilmore Lite Mk2 Class A Headphone Amplifier
   Makes us rethink what a $500 amplifier can sound like.
   Review By Dave Hanson
   The term "reference equipment" might be a bit overused in the personal
   audio hobby. Often times, it is simply a substitute for our "best"
   gear, but what should a true piece of reference gear really be?
   Neutral? Definitely! Transparent to all the gear in your chain?
   Unquestionably! Able to drive anything from IEMs to all but the most
   difficult planars? Indubitably.

   Aaron Weinstein 3X3 Audiophile Edition Hi-Res Music

   Aaron Weinstein 3X3 Audiophile Edition Hi-Res Music
   What if you were presented the same album recorded three different ways
   – different microphone techniques, and different microphones? The
   performers and performances remain the same, but, the means used to
   capture their performances change. Do you feel like you'd know going in
   what you like best? Aaron Weinstein 3X3 Deluxe Audiophile Edition gives
   you the opportunity to explore this very concept. Recorded in a single
   day in a Brooklyn church, this intimate band of three Jazz musicians
   perform an album of beloved instrumental standards captured three
   different ways. Which version is ultimately superior will be a uniquely
   individual answer, and a uniquely satisfying listening experience for
   all.

   Aaron Weinstein, a rising star in the New York Jazz community, makes
   his Chesky Records debut on 3x3, an album of instrumental Jazz
   standards that not only experiments with modern recording
   methodologies, but with the boundaries of Jazz expression. Featuring
   Aaron Weinstein (violin), Matt Munisteri (Guitar), Tom Hubbard (Bass),
   3x3 is the perfect illustration of the beauty of simplicity. No
   unnecessary production; no extemporaneous distractions. You're left
   with stunning musicianship, breathtaking acoustics, and evocative and
   memorable music.

   RMAF Vs. CEDIA And Twice Vs. CE Pro

   Senseless Ramblings
   RMAF Vs. CEDIA And Twice Vs. CE Pro
   And we'll never have a high-end audio organization.
   Editorial By Steven R. Rochlin
   Since this is a Senseless Rambling article by Yours Truly, loyal
   readers of mine know what to expect. So grab the popcorn, a fine
   beverage and listen to some cool n' crazy tunes. Or something more 'age
   appropriate' as we are discussing the latest generations of music
   enthusiasts.

   Ear Jewelry For Audiophiles

   Ear Jewelry For Audiophiles
   Roger Skoff writes about the state of the 'art' in Hi-Fi.
   Article By Roger Skoff
   Have you seen what some of the latest, ultimate, super-duper High-End
   turntables look like? To me, they're reminiscent of what the "cities of
   the future" looked like in those old Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon movie
   serials of the 1930s and 1940s � great networks of massive gleaming
   towers, all surrounded and interconnected by loops and swirls of the
   aerial highways predicted by the people back then to be the roads for
   the flying cars of the future.

   LampizatOr Amber III (DAC) Review

   World Premiere Review!
   LampizatOr Amber III Hi-Res DAC
   Fall in love with your music all over again.
   Review By Dave Hanson
   It's one thing to create a component that listeners can appreciate.
   It's quite another to create a component that makes listeners
   appreciate their music even more. For me, the LampizatOr Amber III
   digital to analog converter ($2750 on up depending on options) falls
   into the latter category, quite decisively, in fact. It's a component
   that reintroduces you to your music, and it produces love at first
   listen.

   Audio Analogue Maestro Anniversary Integrated Amplifier Review

   Audio Analogue Maestro Anniversary Int. Amplifier
   A sonic wolf in sheep's clothing.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   When I was asked if I would like to review Audio Analogue's newest
   integrated amplifier, I exclaimed "Yes!". Why? Because even on paper it
   seemed as if it was an extremely well-designed integrated amplifier,
   and also could easily power my reference speakers with a healthy 150
   Watts per channel into 8 Ohms, its power doubling each time its
   impedance load is halved � and besides all this, I love equipment
   that's made in Italy. Even if some of this gear isn't a perfect match
   for the system in which it would be auditioned, I never have been
   disappointed in the sound quality of any of those components.

   Kharma Elegance dB7-S Floorstanding Speakers Review

   Kharma Elegance dB7-S Floorstanding Speakers
   Gorgeous looks... and they look as good as they sound.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Let's be clear. Kharma Elegance dB7-Sare not the largest or the most
   expensive high-end loudspeakers one can buy. They aren't even the
   largest or most expensive speakers in the line that they are a part of.
   But they are gorgeous high-end speakers that sound as good as they
   look, and obviously designed, built, and are intended to be included in
   the best high-end audio systems that are owned by those that consider
   themselves to be discriminating audiophiles. One can place them into an
   existing system, or one can build a fine system around these speakers.

   Sonus faber Olympica @ World Of McIntosh NYC

   Sonus faber Olympica @ World Of McIntosh NYC
   A good high-end system is akin to a time machine.
   Review By Tom Lyle
   Last year I took a tour of World Of McIntosh, a very impressive
   five-story luxury townhouse in the Soho neighborhood of downtown New
   York City. World Of McIntosh is an amazing place, packed with working
   audio systems featuring gear from McIntosh, Sonus faber, Pro-Ject Audio
   Systems, Audio Research, and more. This luxurious space is used as an
   event space, for invitation only audio tours, and for anything else one
   who wants to use a space "where music and design are merged in a way
   that's striking, memorable, and undeniably enjoyable".
