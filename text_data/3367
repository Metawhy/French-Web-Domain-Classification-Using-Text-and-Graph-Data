     __________________________________________________________________

   The Appleton Museum of Art works hard to provide the community with
   continuous, world class programming and events. Though it may be
   assumed that the cost of visitor admission and membership dues cover
   the cost of operating the museum, they only cover 5% of the museum's
   annual expenditures. The Appleton relies on many sources for funding.
   One source is donations from individuals in the community.

   We are deeply grateful for your continued support. For more information
   about giving to the Appleton, contact Victoria Billig, 352-291-4455,
   ext. 1294.
   Fill out my online form.

What Your Money Can Do

   exhibitions, special events and cultural awareness in our community.

   class.
