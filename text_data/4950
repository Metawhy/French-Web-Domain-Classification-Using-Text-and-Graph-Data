How Much Are Jewish Non-Profit Leaders Making?

   Transparency. Conversation. Fairness. Those are the aims of the
   Forward’s salary survey, now published for the seventh year. We shine a
   light on the gender composition and compensation of our top national
   not-for-profit leaders in the hopes that it will spur serious
   conversation about creating a fairer workplace in the Jewish community
   and beyond.

   If you are a volunteer at one of these organizations, a client, a
   donor, an employer or an employee — you deserve this information. It is
   required to be public as part of the contract charities make with the
   federal government and therefore with all Americans.

How much are Jewish not-for-profit CEOs making? Click on each entry for more
information.

   Remember: by virtue of the fact that not-for-profits are absolved from
   paying taxes, the rest of us subsidize their work. We do that because
   these charities perform a valuable function serving our community, and
   we have the right to expect transparency in return.

   So I wish to thank all those who answered our calls to help us compile
   this data, to verify its accuracy and place it in the context it
   deserves.

   I am indebted to research editor Maia Efrem, who oversaw the extensive
   work necessary to collect and analyze reams of numbers, and whose work
   ethic is only matched by her journalistic commitment to accuracy and
   fairness. She was ably assisted by Antoaneta Roussi and Talya Zax. I
   would also like to thank Kurt Hoffman, Anya Ulinich and Elaine Tin Nyo.

   This is the third year that we have been assisted by Dr. Abraham Wyner,
   professor of statistics at the Wharton School of the University of
   Pennsylvania, who volunteers his considerable talents to make these
   numbers make sense. Thanks also to Tableau, for their pro bono help in
   creating our terrific interactive charts on forward.com.
