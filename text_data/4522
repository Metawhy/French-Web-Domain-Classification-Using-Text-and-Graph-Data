Winamp 5.8

   A leaked version of Winamp 5.8 recently spread over the Internet.
   Consequently, we have decided to make this new version available to
   you, revised by us.

   We therefore recommend that you download this version rather than any
   other as we guarantee it is safe for you to use.

   This version is not an ongoing project but be sure that we are
   currently working hard on a future new Winamp. Scroll down to learn
   more!
