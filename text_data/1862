Abstract

   Fire is an important and arguably unnatural component of many wet
   Amazonian and Andean forest systems. Soil charcoal has been used to
   infer widespread human use of landscapes prior to European Conquest. An
   analysis of Amazonian soil carbon records reveals that the records have
   distinct spatial and temporal patterns, suggesting that either fires
   were only set in moderately seasonal areas of Amazonia or that strongly
   seasonal and aseasonal areas are undersampled. Synthesizing data from
   300 charcoal records, an age–frequency diagram reveals peaks of fire
   apparently coinciding with some periods of very strong El Niño
   activity. However, the El Niño record does not always provide an
   accurate prediction of fire timing, and a better match is found in the
   record of insolation minima. After the time of European contact, fires
   became much scarcer within Amazonia. In both the Amazonia and the
   Andes, modern fire pattern is strongly allied to human activity. On the
   flank of the Andes, forests that have never burned are being eroded by
   fire spreading downslope from grasslands. Species of these same forests
   are being forced to migrate upslope due to warming and will encounter a
   firm artificial fire boundary of human activity.

1. Introduction

   Climate change threatens Amazonian biodiversity both directly and
   indirectly (e.g. Nepstad et al. 2004). The only climate model that
   captures feedbacks among atmosphere, ocean and vegetation predicts a
   near-permanent El Niño-like state in the Pacific and growing drought
   across Amazonia this century (Cox et al. 2004). Using the IS92a
   ‘business-as-usual’ scenario, this model predicts that almost all of
   Brazilian Amazonia will be too dry to support rainforest by AD 2100
   (Shindell et al. 2001; Cox et al. 2004). Other climate models make less
   dire predictions, but almost all project a significant loss of forest
   cover due to climate change this century.

   While climate change can induce forest dieback on century time scales,
   fire is a much more immediate threat (Barlow & Peres 2004; Nepstad et
   al. 2004). Based on the exponential increase in the area burned in
   Amazonia over the last 30 years, fire associated with human activity
   and drying is likely to be what eliminates the forest rather than the
   gradual stress of climate change (Nepstad et al. 2004).

   Understanding the fire ecology of Amazonian systems is critical to
   establishing conservation policy, and also to understand the current
   vegetation dynamics, carbon balance and successional state (Barlow &
   Peres 2004). One key tool in developing such an understanding is to use
   the pre-historic record to assess the effects of fire during past
   phases of El Niño activity and periods of human disturbance. In this
   paper, we highlight examples of past and projected interactions of
   climate, fire and human activity.

(a) Pre-Columbian fires in Amazonia

   Forest fire in much of Amazonia is a synergistic consequence of drought
   and human activity. The escape of human-set fires to become wildfires
   under El Niño-induced drought conditions in Kalimantan in 1997–1998
   (van Nieuwstadt et al. 2001), and Amazonia in the droughts of 1997–1998
   and 2002–2005 (Marengo et al. submitted) are examples of such
   interactions. Also, especially in evergreen forests, fires are more
   easily started during drier versus wetter periods, linking overall
   precipitation levels and human activity (e.g. Cochrane et al. 2002).

   Not all of Amazonia is equally likely to burn. Nepstad et al. (2004)
   identified seasonality, drought duration and soil type as key factors
   in determining the flammability of Amazonian systems. Almost all
   contemporary Amazonian fires are either set deliberately, accidental or
   intentional burns that escape to become a wildfire (e.g. Hammond & ter
   Steege 1998). In mesic Amazonian systems, truly natural fires are very
   rare (Cochrane et al. 2002), and some palaeoecological records spanning
   thousands of years show no indication of fire (e.g. Bush et al.
   2007a,b). The prevailing view is that natural fire in Amazonian
   rainforest is so rare that charcoal is interpreted to indicate human
   activity. During known dry times, such as the Mid-Holocene drought
   episodes between ca 8000 and 5000 cal. yr BP, it is plausible that
   natural fires occurred in most seasonal settings (see Mayle & Power
   2008), and may have contributed to the large-scale patterns of plant
   species diversity found in the Amazon basin (Silman 2007).

   Whatever the source of ignition, fire occurrence is related to drought
   in Amazonia. Such droughts can be induced by weather patterns in both
   the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and El Niño et al. events have been
   linked to some of the strongest periods of fire activity in the last
   decades (Kitzberger et al. 2001). However, unusual warmth in the
   northern tropical Atlantic also induces droughts and may be linked to
   fire activity (Marengo 2007). The warm water sets up a see-saw
   oscillation in the Hadley cells that displaces the intertropical
   convergence zone northwards, leading to drought in northern Amazonia
   (Baker 2002). Such an influence of this Atlantic oscillation is the
   strongest when El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is relatively weak
   (Marengo et al. submitted), meaning that there can be drought
   independent of ENSO. The generally opposite phasing of precipitation in
   the northern tropical Atlantic and Amazonia may be influenced by
   variability in solar output (Hodell et al. 2001; Shindell et al. 2001).
   Periods of high solar output coincide with droughts in the Caribbean
   and floods in Amazonia (e.g. Mauas & Flamenco 2005), while low solar
   output has the opposite effect.

   Under normal conditions of moisture, the probability of fire decreases
   exponentially with distance from roads and clearings (Cochrane &
   Laurance 2002), demonstrating that the initiation of these fires is
   largely a result of human activity. In a study of forests near
   Tailândia, Brazil, Cochrane & Laurance (2002) found a subdecadal return
   period for fire at the edge of forest fragments, whereas at a distance
   of more than 2500 m into the forest the fire frequency was the same as
   background level (i.e. no fires documented in the last 500–1000 years).
   These data indicate that in these moderately seasonal forests, fires
   almost always burn themselves out within a few hundred metres and do
   not spread to form a large wildfire. However, during droughts, fires
   initiated by human activity can spread as wildfires. In the Brazilian
   state of Acre, at the epicentre of the 2005 drought, the area of
   leakage forest fires was more than five times greater than the area
   directly deforested. Fire leakage into flammable forests may be,
   therefore, the major agent of biome transformation in the event of
   increasing drought frequency (Aragão et al. 2007).

   In summary, fire frequency is some function of both climate and human
   interventions. The vast majority of Amazonian fires are sparked by
   humans and fire spreads most readily in areas and times of high
   flammability. These observations lead to basic testable predictions for
   the palaeoecological record: (i) Amazonian fires of the past are
   primarily associated with human disturbance, (ii) the highest
   proportion of sites exhibiting fire will coincide with the driest
   periods of Amazonian history (rather than the time of the highest
   population) and that (iii) highly seasonal settings will exhibit a
   higher incidence of fire than aseasonal ones.

(b) The palaeoecological record

   Charcoal analysis has become a standard tool used to assess past fire
   histories (e.g. Horn & Sanford 1992; Whitlock & Larsen 2001; Mayle et
   al. 2007). Soil charcoal has also been widely used to date past fire
   events via ^14C (e.g. Hammond et al. 2006; Titiz & Sanford 2007) and,
   while there may be uncertainties for some forest types (Gavin 2001),
   dating is expected to be within the resolution of ^14C dating errors.

   The majority of sites where soil charcoal has been documented in
   Amazonia lie in moderately seasonal forests (figure 1a). While extreme
   drought may terminate with a lightning event that sparks a fire, it is
   far more probable that humans initiate the fires (Bush et al. 2007a).
   The synergy between human activity and drought comes when flammability
   increases; small fires initiated by humans can run out of control and
   become large wildfires.

   One possibility is that the observed pattern is a product of where
   modern infrastructure and accessibility has focused sampling
   (sensuNelson et al. 1990). An alternative (not mutually exclusive)
   explanation is that the wettest areas of western Amazonia have very low
   fire frequencies, with very little chance of wildfire escape. Indeed,
   the burned sites in the wetter forests of San Carlos near the
   Venezuelan border were directly associated with potsherds (Sanford et
   al. 1985; Saldarriaga & West 1986) indicating local human presence. As
   seasonality increases, the risk of wildfire through fire escape
   increases. Even the Guyanan forests sampled by Hammond et al. (2006),
   although not particularly seasonal, have some of the highest
   interannual variability in rainfall and are very drought prone (Hammond
   et al. 2006). The driest areas of Amazonia have yet to provide soil
   charcoal records. Given the known use and occupation of the savannahs
   (e.g. Erickson 2001), it is considered probable that soil charcoal will
   be found in those locations as surveys are expanded.

   Temporally, the pattern of fire events does not coincide with a simple
   trajectory of increasing human population and settlement prior to a
   crash in the 1500s–1600s. A surge in fire events is evident between ca
   AD 200 and AD 600, and this coincides with archaeological data for an
   increased adoption of agriculture that reaches a peak with the
   formation of terra preta soils (Amazonian dark earths) between AD 400
   and AD 800 (Neves et al. 2004; figure 1b). The peak of fire frequency
   at ca AD 800 coincides with a peak of inferred El Niño activity (Moy et
   al. 2002). At ca AD 700–800 and AD 1000–1100, drought is inferred to
   have promoted fire escape; El Niño-induced drought may have spurred
   wildfires. However, the El Niño pattern alone is not enough to lead to
   accurate predictions of past fire activity. For example, another active
   El Niño period in the 1300s has no corresponding peak of Amazonian
   fires.

   Schimmelmann et al. (2003) suggested an approximately 200-year
   periodicity to flood and drought regimes in Amazonia and attributed the
   pattern to a blend of El Niño Southern Oscillation variability and
   solar activity. Indeed, modern empirical data from Amazonia show a
   strong positive relationship between high solar radiance and peak
   discharge of the Parana River (Mauas & Flamenco 2005). Again,
   recognizing the limitations of this dataset, the coincidence of peaks
   of charcoal occurrence with minima of solar output and general trends
   of increased solar output matching few charcoal records are highly
   suggestive that solar input has played a substantial role in
   establishing the pre-Columbian pattern of fires (figure 1b). The
   translation of solar minima into climatic change is unclear, with
   suggested mechanisms being weakening the thermohaline circulation (Bond
   et al. 2001) or via reduced cloud formation as a result of interactions
   with cosmic rays (Svensmark & Friis-Christensen 1997).

   The insolation minima are associated with Amazonian drought (above),
   but post-1600 insolation minima did not engender a fire signature
   because human populations were collapsing and agriculture was abandoned
   (Myers 1988; Black 1992; Denevan 2003). That these strong insolation
   minima did not result in large peaks of fire activity is further
   evidence of the importance of humans as initiators of fire. We
   hypothesize that the majority of fire records between AD 200 and AD
   1400 resulted from fire escape rather than necessarily reflecting
   intentional human manipulation at that exact site.

   Another way to visualize the pattern of fires is to look at the spatial
   distribution of known fires within given time slices (figure 2a–f). The
   time slices are selected to represent times of high and low fire
   frequency, and the period before and after European Conquest. Terra
   preta, a strong indicator both of human presence and some localized
   fire activity, is present along many of the major Amazon channels,
   especially in moderately seasonal areas. In the soil charcoal data,
   there is some, but not a complete, overlap with the terra preta,
   possibly suggesting different styles of management or that some areas
   were more prone to accidental fires than others. Although the northern
   half of the Amazon basin responds differently to El Niño forcing than
   the southern half (Marengo 2007), no clear north–south or east–west
   oscillation is apparent in the charcoal data time slices. From these
   limited data, it appears that fires were either present across a
   relatively wide area or they were similarly absent.

   time slices mapped with climate variability. (a) All records, (b) AD

   The contemporary fire history observed by satellite data (figure 3a–d)
   shows a clear distribution of fire probability related to both the
   climate and human-induced fragmentations across the Amazon basin. The
   probability of fire occurrence in a given year and averaged over 17
   years (1982–1999) shows two patterns: (i) areas with high rainfall and
   short-to-moderate dry seasons in the central and western Amazon basin
   have very low probability of fire occurrence and (ii) areas along the
   arc of deforestation and longer dry seasons have high probability of
   fire (Carmona-Moreno et al. 2005). An important aspect of defining the
   fire regime in Amazonia is the probability of fire occurring in a
   particular season for a given area (figure 3). The cumulative
   probability of seasonal distribution of fire derived from the satellite
   observation over the same period (1982–1999) indicates low probability
   of fire occurring in the first two quarters of the year associated with
   the rainy seasons December–January–February and March–April–May. Fire
   seasons are stable over the entire 17-year record, suggesting a high
   concentration of fire during dry seasons June to August and September
   to November with approximately three trimesters shift between fire
   activity in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere in Amazonia. One can
   hypothesize that although interannual variations in climate (e.g. ENSO
   events) may impact the intensity of fire occurrence, they have little
   or no effects on the fire seasonality.

   The full geographical extent of fires associated with insolation minima
   is not known. If these were local fires that failed to spread, then
   biodiversity impacts would have been minimal. At the other extreme, if
   all the seasonal forests of Amazonia were burning, there would have
   been significant impacts on both biodiversity and climate, i.e.
   contributing to the medieval warm period (sensuRuddiman 2003). Species
   that benefit from the early successional forests, which anthropogenic
   activity generates, and human commensals would have increased in
   abundance, while those that are obligate deep forest inhabitants would
   have faced local extinction (Pearsall 2002; Barlow et al. 2003; Barlow
   & Peres 2004).

   The ongoing climate changes are projected to reduce precipitation over
   much of Amazonia, with the eastern half of the basin supporting
   savannah rather than forest within the next 50–100 years. As forests
   generate their own microclimate, they can survive at lower
   precipitation than the amount needed for them to regenerate (Sternberg
   2001). While this observation may indicate that climate models are
   likely to exaggerate the loss of forest, the encroachment of fire as a
   result of human activity would more than offset that microclimatic
   buffer (see Barlow & Peres 2008). The net result of climate change and
   human encroachment is likely to be one of large-scale forest loss with
   fire rather than climate change being the immediate agent of
   destruction (Cochrane et al. 2002; Nepstad et al. 2004).

2. Climate change and fire history on the flank of the Andes: a Peruvian case
study

   The second example that we wish to discuss is the interaction between
   fire, climate change and human activity on the Andean flank. The
   foothills and eastern slope of the Andes harbour exceptional
   biodiversity. Very few data on fire histories exist for these forests.
   To date, palaeoecological analyses of records from lake sediments
   within modern cloud forest settings have not yielded charcoal (H.
   Hooghiemstra 2007, personal communication), indicating the absence of
   human occupation and natural fires. Near the upper elevational limit of
   woodland growth, local charcoal concentrations increased markedly at ca
   11 700 cal. yr BP in records from Peru and Bolivia: Lakes Titicaca
   (16° S, 3800 m), Caserococha (13° S, 3900 m; Paduano 2001) and Chochos
   (6° S, 3300 m; Bush et al. 2005). Fires are thought to have reduced
   woodland cover, especially Polylepis, the fire-sensitive genus of
   treelet that, in the absence of fire, forms the highest woodlands in
   the Andes (Kessler 1995).

   Within the last 3300 years, the overall climatic trajectory on the
   Andean flank has been towards wetter conditions (Abbott et al. 2003;
   Bush et al. 2005), though there have been distinct drought events
   inferred within that time (Meggers 1994; Abbott et al. 2003). On first
   principles, a wet period would be expected to limit fire frequency and
   allow some upslope invasion of trees into the puna. Such periods can
   promote fuel build-up, allowing larger and hotter fires to burn during
   the next fire cycle (Kitzberger et al. 2001). Treeline has probably
   been artificially depressed during this period by human-induced burning
   for pastoralism and cropping (Ellenberg 1958). Consequently, the modern
   treeline that commonly occurs between 3200 and 3500 m elevation in Peru
   would, in the absence of human activity, lie closer to 3700–3900 for
   many species, with Polylepis perhaps forming open woodlands up to
   4800 m elevation (Ellenberg 1958; Kessler 1995).

   Fire-generated limits to altitudinal migration are likely to be a major
   threat to Amazonian diversity for species whose ranges lie above 2600 m
   in the Andes. Ongoing climate change is expected to induce upslope
   migrations of plants and animals to maintain their bioclimatic
   envelopes (Malcolm et al. 2006). The Hadley CM3 model suggests an
   approximately 3–5°C warming for the Peruvian Andes by the end of this
   century (Cox et al. 2000). Moist air adiabatic lapse rates are
   approximately 5°C in this section of the Andes, and thus a vertical
   migration of approximately 600–1000 m would be required to maintain an
   equivalent temperature. While migration distances are very short,
   normally 20–40 km laterally to achieve that gain in altitude,
   significant barriers to dispersal may still exist. As people continue
   to clear the upper limit of the cloud forest and fire penetrates lower,
   there will be no opportunity for species to migrate upwards across this
   fire line. We term this upward pressure from climate change met by the
   downward pressure of land use the ‘Big Squeeze’.

   At the foot of the Andes and on the lower Andean flank, fire will be a
   very significant threat. Although relatively wet in many areas, this
   region has been extensively exploited for coffee, coca, rice and other
   crops (Bush 2002). In any area where there is ready access, little
   natural habitat remains between 500 and 1500 m elevation, forming a
   green gap between large areas of relatively intact forest above and
   below this range. With improved communication and transportation, this
   cultivable section of the Andes will be even more heavily exploited.
   If, as some models predict, cloud base lifts in response to warmer
   conditions, the green gap will press upwards. Pressing down from above
   will be human land use.

   Given the residence time of greenhouse gases, and increasing
   industrialization, it would be unduly optimistic to expect no need for
   climate-forced migration over the next century. Averting the worst
   effects of the ‘Green Gap’ and the ‘Big Squeeze’ will require vertical
   migration corridors to be established. Taking degraded lands into
   conservation now, so that succession can start, may mean that in 50–100
   years time, they will be part of the ecological conduit rather than a
   barrier. Changing land management, especially burning practices near
   treeline, and substituting low-density grazing land with carbon
   sequestering forests may provide an alternate source of revenue and be
   of immense ecological value.

3. Conclusions

   Fire histories for Amazonia are only just beginning to become
   available. A close correlation between human activity and burning is
   found, while under other circumstances fire is generally very rare.
   Pre-Columbian occupants of Amazonia burned the forest to clear it for
   agriculture, and perhaps also to improve hunting. Soil charcoal data
   suggest that episodes of wildfire coincide with insolation minima as
   droughts beset Amazonia. The spatial extent of these fires has yet to
   be resolved, and thus their impact on regional biodiversity cannot be
   estimated. However, from the preliminary data, it appears probable that
   the impacts of fire were rather local, and do not correspond to the
   regional conflagration associated with the advancing front of
   deforestation observed in recent times.

   In the Amazon lowlands, increasing flammability due to the synergy of
   projected climate change and forest fragmentation strongly suggests
   that by 2050 much of eastern Amazonia will be fire prone. A few species
   will be well suited to the new conditions (mainly those that also live
   outside mesic forest settings), but for many more, usable habitat will
   be lost and local, perhaps global, extinction will follow. In western
   Amazonia, the wetter conditions will probably limit the spread of fire,
   but increased penetration of currently intact forests for mineral
   extraction, transportation or cultivation will greatly enhance the
   probability of wildfire. Even where fire does not form a threat,
   increasing human populations accessing bushmeat may set in motion
   trophic cascades that have largely unforeseen consequences (Redford
   1992; Silman et al. 2003; Terborgh et al. 2006).

   On the eastern flank of the Andes, the cloud forest, an unparalleled
   system for biodiversity, will be pressured from forced upslope
   migration in response to climate change and the downslope erosion of
   treeline as a result of burning Andean pastures. Conservation measures
   are needed now to minimize the effects of climate change and to promote
   sustainable land use that will facilitate climate-induced species
   migration.

Abstract

   Drought-induced wildfires have increased in frequency and extent over
   the tropics. Yet, the long-term (greater than 10 years) responses of
   Amazonian lowland forests to fire disturbance are poorly known. To
   understand post-fire forest biomass dynamics, and to assess the time
   required for fire-affected forests to recover to pre-disturbance
   levels, we combined 16 single with 182 multiple forest census into a
   unique large-scale and long-term dataset across the Brazilian Amazonia.
   We quantified biomass, mortality and wood productivity of burned plots
   along a chronosequence of up to 31 years post-fire and compared to
   surrounding unburned plots measured simultaneously. Stem mortality and
   growth were assessed among functional groups. At the plot level, we
   found that fire-affected forests have biomass levels 24.8 ± 6.9% below
   the biomass value of unburned control plots after 31 years. This lower
   biomass state results from the elevated levels of biomass loss through
   mortality, which is not sufficiently compensated for by wood
   productivity (incremental growth + recruitment). At the stem level, we
   found major changes in mortality and growth rates up to 11 years
   post-fire. The post-fire stem mortality rates exceeded unburned control
   plots by 680% (i.e. greater than 40 cm diameter at breast height (DBH);
   5–8 years since last fire) and 315% (i.e. greater than 0.7 g cm^−3 wood
   density; 0.75–4 years since last fire). Our findings indicate that
   wildfires in humid tropical forests can significantly reduce forest
   biomass for decades by enhancing mortality rates of all trees,
   including large and high wood density trees, which store the largest
   amount of biomass in old-growth forests. This assessment of stem
   dynamics, therefore, demonstrates that wildfires slow down or stall the
   post-fire recovery of Amazonian forests.

   This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The impact of the
   2015/2016 El Niño on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns,
   mechanisms and implications’.

1. Introduction

   The successful reduction of the deforestation rate in the Brazilian
   Amazon between 2004 and 2017 has not been sufficient to reduce
   disturbance in the remaining forests [1]. Recent studies demonstrate
   that human-induced disturbances (e.g. wildfires and selective logging)
   can halve the conservation value and significantly decrease the carbon
   stocks of remaining Amazonian forests [2–4]. Moreover, Amazonian
   forests affected by wildfires are estimated to contribute on average 31
   ± 21% of the gross emission values from deforestation, with
   contributions beyond 50% during drought years [5]. Yet, there is a
   critical knowledge gap regarding the long-term recovery of carbon
   stocks in forests affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as fire
   [2,3,6].

   Humid tropical forests are not a fire-adapted ecosystem [7,8]. Previous
   studies suggested that wildfires in the Amazon basin have been rare
   since the start of the Holocene, with fire-return intervals exceeding
   centuries or millennia [8,9]. However, over the past three to four
   decades, wildfires have become increasingly prevalent across humid
   tropical forests, including Amazonia [10]. These tropical fires
   generally require an anthropogenic source to ignite, which generally
   comes from agricultural practices [11]. The likelihood of wildfires
   occurrence is also increased by forest disturbance, such as selective
   logging [12], and by deforestation that exposes remaining forests to
   edge effects [13] and reduces rainfall [14,15]. In addition, wildfires
   can be greatly exacerbated by extreme drought events [5,12,16–19]. For
   example, during the 2015 El Niño-induced extreme drought, 799 293 km^2
   of the Brazilian Amazon experienced positive active fire anomalies [5].
   Given that extreme droughts are predicted to occur at a greater
   frequency in the Amazon Basin [20], wildfires are likely to become even
   more pervasive [21].

   These wildfires have a major impact on forest carbon stocks, accounting
   for the mortality of up to 36% of tree stems and 67% of the biomass
   loss in central Amazonian forests 3 years after fires [22,23].
   Fire-affected forests consequently become a globally important carbon
   source: based on the 2010 fire season, it was estimated that 27 555
   km^2 of old-growth forests burned in the whole Brazilian Legal Amazon,
   contributing to 14.8 Tg of C emissions to the atmosphere from direct
   combustion of organic material [19]. Immediately combustible carbon
   stocks—such as leaf litter and fine woody debris—make up only a very
   small proportion of forests' above-ground carbon stock [2] and most
   emissions are committed (0.001 to 0.165 Pg of C), which means they are
   likely to occur years after wildfires as a result of vegetation
   mortality and its subsequent decomposition [16].

   Despite the growing prevalence and importance of wildfires in humid
   tropical forests, our knowledge of their ecological consequences is
   constrained by the lack of data in three key areas. First, the
   longer-term effects of wildfires on forest biomass are not known as
   most studies to date have focussed on relatively short-term responses
   of vegetation to fire [24–27]. For example, a pan-tropical assessment
   suggests there is no recovery of forest carbon stocks within at least 5
   years [28], while a study on flooded Amazonian forests highlights the
   potential for fires to impede forest succession in the first 15 years
   after fire [29]. Second, most assessments are one-off inventories,
   meaning ecological processes and stem dynamics in fire-affected forests
   are very poorly understood. Extensive field assessments in undisturbed
   Amazonian forests show the importance of repeat surveys, which have
   enabled researchers to link the spatial variation of forest biomass to
   stem dynamics such as mortality and recruitment [30,31]. Finally, there
   are no data linking post-fire long-term forest dynamics with functional
   traits. Plant traits such as bark thickness and wood density provide
   important insights into post-fire changes and the susceptibility of
   forest ecosystems [32–36], especially as they are directly related to
   carbon storage function [37]. Recently, an assessment of the impacts of
   fire and other forest disturbances has shown that wood density remains
   below baseline conditions for at least 25 years following disturbance,
   indicating a slow recovery or impeded succession [38]. Longer-term
   assessments of forest dynamics could provide additional insights into
   the successional trajectories of burned forests, and their ability to
   recompose carbon stocks.

   We address these knowledge gaps by using a unique large-scale and
   long-term assessment of forest dynamics, which is based on a set of
   chronosequences and re-census data from burned and unburned forests in
   five distinct regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We ask two main research
   questions:
     * (i) What are the longer-term effects of wildfires on forest biomass
       (i.e. up to 31 years after the fires)? We address this question by
       comparing, at the plot level, the total aboveground biomass (TAGB),
       and forest dynamics represented by mortality and wood productivity,
       between burned and unburned forests. The balance between tree
       mortality and productivity defines the ability of these
       fire-affected forests to recover to pre-disturbance carbon levels
       and offset carbon emissions.
     * (ii) How do wildfires affect forest growth, recruitment and
       mortality at stem level, and what insights do key structural traits
       such as wood density and stem size (diameter at breast height
       (DBH)) provide into the mechanisms underpinning the changes in
       biomass? We focus on wood density and size because both are
       important predictors of short-term fire-induced mortality [32,33]
       and both are linked to stem growth rates and carbon storage in
       undisturbed forests [39,40]. We divided stems into three classes of
       wood density and size to examine the changes in the probability
       density functions of growth, recruitment and mortality over time
       since fire degradation.

   Finally, we combine results from both questions to discuss to what
   extent Amazon forests are recovering from fires.

2. Material and methods

(a) Experimental design for field data collection

   We used tree inventory data collected as part of the Fire-Associated
   Transient Emissions in Amazonia (FATE) network. Since 2009, the FATE
   network has been monitoring permanent forest plots established in
   burned forests with different times since wildfire occurrence. Here, we
   collected and analysed field data from 64 permanent plots across
   Amazonia, from which we revisited and re-measured 55. All plots are
   located on old-growth non-flooded forests (Terra Firme) with 269.3 m
   median distance from the edge. We examined the terrain elevation and
   slope within 100 m buffer of each plot using a high-resolution (12.5 m)
   digital elevation model (ALOS PALSAR RTC). There is a very small slope
   across the plots (range: 2.8°–9.4°). Plots ranged from 0.25 to 1 ha.
   From a total of 64 plots, 29 are in unburned and 35 plots are in burned
   forests (electronic supplementary material, table S1).

   We selected burned forest sites based on the inspection of Landsat
   images (1984–2016) followed by on-the-ground field confirmation. When
   we did not find evidence of fire in the satellite image for a specific
   site, but there was charcoal in the ground, we assumed the fire event
   occurred at the time of the earliest image (i.e. 1984). Because of the
   high intensity of the 1982–83 El Niño event, when 3.6 million ha were
   burned in East Kalimantan [41], it is likely that several forested
   areas elsewhere were affected by wildfires during this period. To
   enable pairwise comparisons between burned and unburned control sites,
   both were selected to avoid other anthropogenic disturbances such as
   selective logging. The unburned control plots, moreover, were carefully
   chosen to encompass a similar range and heterogeneity of both soils and
   topography to the burned sites. Independent proxies of fire intensity,
   such as char height, are not available for plots assessed a long time
   after fires when many of the affected trees will have died and
   decomposed. Without this additional information, we assume that all
   plots were subjected to low-intensity understorey wildfires that are
   the norm in previously undisturbed forests.

   Our 31 years chronosequence dataset captures the effect of wildfires
   driven by El Niño events and North tropical Atlantic warming since the
   1980s. The distribution of the FATE plots reflects the spatial
   occurrence of these major wildfire events (e.g. figure 1a) and
   accessibility. In order to link drought intensity over the last 40
   years with wildfire extent, we used re-analysis derived data to
   calculate Maximum Climatological Water Deficit (MCWD) and
   satellite-derived products of burned area (BA) (please see detailed
   methods in electronic supplementary material, method S1). The data
   extracted from each plot location, along the BA and MCWD time series,
   show the association between MCWD and BA in each plots region (East,
   Southwest, Central, Southeast and North; figure 1b). Figure 1b also
   demonstrates when each site was sampled relative to the last fire
   event.

   deficit (MCWD) and burned area (BA) anomalies (s.d.) over the Brazilian

   S1). (a) MCWD red values representing extreme drought, or negative

(b) Field inventory and total above-ground biomass

   The inventory was conducted following the RAINFOR network protocol for
   the establishment of permanent sample plots [42]. We estimated
   above-ground biomass (AGB) of 9836 live trees, palms and lianas with
   DBH ≥ 10 cm. For both burned and unburned forests, TAGB represents the
   sum of all trees, palms and lianas AGB, and was estimated using a
   specific allometric equation for each group, following [37] for trees,
   [43] for palms and [44] for lianas. The AGB estimates for palms and
   lianas were based solely on their diameter, while for trees DBH and
   specific wood density values were used as input variables. We used the
   global wood density database [45,46] to match specific wood density to
   each species. For individuals not identified to the species level
   (approx. 5%), we used the mean value for the species belonging to that
   genus. Similarly, we used the mean specific wood density of the family
   for trees not identified at the genus level [30]. When an accurate
   identification was not achieved, the plot mean specific wood density
   was used.

(c) Plot-level assessment of long-term effects of wildfires on forest biomass

(i) Quantification of plot-level forest dynamics

   To understand the response of old-growth forests to wildfires, we
   evaluated the long-term shifts in forest dynamics at the plot level. We
   quantified for all burned and unburned plots the net biomass change
   (Net TAGB), which is a function of wood productivity (Wp) and mortality
   (M) of all stems in the plot (equation (2.1)).
   Display Formula
   2.1

   The term ΣM corresponds to plot mortality (Mg ha^−1 yr^−1), which was
   calculated as the amount of the biomass of all stems recorded as dead
   within a given census interval. The term ΣWp corresponds to the sum of
   the values of Wp for all measured stems in the plot and can be
   decomposed as (equation (2.2)).
   Display Formula
   2.2
   where Wp (Mg ha^−1 yr^−1) was calculated as the sum of the biomass of
   stems that recruited during each census interval (ΣRecruits) and the
   sum of the growth in biomass of each stem present in the plot (ΣGrowth)
   during this same census interval.

   Because census interval varied among plots, rates were weighted by the
   census interval length. In order to account for trees that both
   recruited and died during the census interval and also to correct for
   tree growth prior their death, M and Wp values were corrected at a
   tree-by-tree basis, following methods of [47].

(ii) Quantification of differences between burned and unburned forests

   To assess if TAGB and dynamics from burned forests recovered to
   pre-disturbance levels, we quantified the per cent of the difference
   between burned and unburned forests. For TAGB and each dynamic
   parameter, the proportional difference between each burned plot and the
   mean of unburned plots were calculated as described in equation (2.3):
   Display Formula
   2.3
   where X represents the variable of interest (TAGB, M, Wp and Net TAGB),
   BU[(i)] is each of the burned plots, and UB[(mean)] is the local mean
   of all unburned plots sampled in the same region at the same time as
   the burned plots. The error is presented as standard error of the mean
   (s.e.).

(iii) Long-term trajectories of burned forests' total aboveground biomass and
dynamics

   We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) to assess the
   trajectories of TAGB, M, Wp and Net TAGB over the time since last fire
   chronosequence. We used each individual plot measured repeatedly as a
   random effect. To assess the direction of the difference (%) in each
   variable in relation to the control-unburned forests, we used the local
   polynomial regression fit (LOESS), choosing the span values based on
   the minimum residual standard error obtained. All statistical analyses
   were performed in R v. 3.3.3 using gamm4 [48] R and lme4 [49] packages.

(d) Stem-level assessment of growth, recruitment and mortality

   To explore the structural and successional mechanisms driving the
   long-term changes on TAGB of burned forests, we assessed the empirical
   probability density function of stem mortality rate and stem growth in
   three DBH (cm) classes: 10.0 to 19.9, 20 to 39.9 and greater than 40.0;
   and three specific wood density (g cm^−3) classes: 0.1 to 0.49, 0.5 to
   0.69 and greater than 0.7, for both burned and unburned plots.
   Including all plots from all regions, we divided the dataset into four
   categories considering the years since last fire (YSLF): 0.75–4; 5–8;
   9–11; 12–31 years. For each plot, we calculated stem mortality as the
   exponential mortality coefficient (% yr^−1) [50], mean stem growth as
   the annual mean growth (cm yr^−1) of all living individuals and stem
   recruitment as the percentage rate of stems recruited relative to live
   stems in each census (% yr^−1). Stem mortality and stem growth from
   each plot were stratified by classes of diameter, wood density and
   YSLF. Stem recruitment by plot was stratified by YSLF class, but we
   only used a grouping based on wood density class, as all recruitment
   falls into the smallest DBH class. The probability density functions of
   the unburned and burned plots were compared using the Wilcoxon test for
   two samples.

3. Results

(a) The long-term effects of wildfires on forest biomass at plot level

   During the monitoring period, the biomass of unburned forest plots
   remained generally unchanged, with the exception of forest plots from
   southeast and east Amazonia that have experienced high mortality in the
   drought years of 2015 (15.2 Mg ha^−1 yr^−1; n = 4) and 2016 (9.9 Mg
   ha^−1 yr^−1; n = 20) respectively (electronic supplementary material,
   table S2). By contrast, the biomass of burned forest plots changed
   greatly with time since fire (table 1). Immediate fire effects on TAGB
   were smaller, with reduction of −2.1 ± 3.9% up to 4 years post-fire.
   From 5 to 8 years since fire, we found a much greater difference in
   TAGB, with reduction of −22.1 ± 2.9% in burned plots compared to
   unburned controls. The significantly lower biomass persisted up to 31
   years post-fire, when burned plots remained 24.8 ± 6.9% below the
   baseline value of the control plots (figure 2a,e).

   The reduction in TAGB observed in burned forests reflects the imbalance
   between wood productivity and mortality. Although post-fire mortality
   declined during the first 8 years of the chronosequence (figure 2b),
   its negative influence on burned forests biomass is evident
   (figure 2a). The maximum difference in mortality between unburned and
   burned forests was at 4–5 years post-fire (247.4 ± 135.6%, table 1),
   with higher mortality values for burned forests. There was no
   difference in mortality between burned and unburned forests from 8
   until 31 years (figure 2f). Wood productivity in burned forests
   followed a linear decline along the chronosequence (figure 2c).
   However, when compared to unburned forests, Wp rates in burned forests
   remained higher and the difference increased to its maximum value (30 ±
   7.8%, table 1) until 8 years post-fire. The difference in Wp between
   burned and unburned forests then decreased and remained in a
   near-steady state until 31 years post-fire (figure 2g). Moreover, Net
   TAGB in burned forests increased during the first 8 years, shifting
   from a strong negative sign (source) to a neutral state (figure 2d).
   Compared to unburned forests, Net TAGB rates in burned forests were
   lower but increased until 6 years of the chronosequence, and then
   remained steady and equivalent to unburned forests levels (figure 2h).

(b) Uncertainties

   Across pools, the largest uncertainties (table 1) are associated with
   mortality, due to the large influence exerted by the death of a single
   large tree. Temporally, and for all variables, there were large
   uncertainties from 16 to 27 years after fire, where data were lacking
   (figure 2a–h). It is reassuring that the trajectories predicted along
   the chronosequence using the GAMM model and LOESS fit agree. All GAMM
   fitted models' intercept and smooth component (YSLF) are statistically
   significant (table 2). While all models are significant (electronic
   supplementary material, figure S1), residual variability may be
   associated with the ‘random’ deviations from the predicted values that
   are not due to plots' specificities and/or YSLF, suggesting a possible
   association with fire intensity and environment conditions.
   Accordingly, the large TAGB and mortality variability observed across
   the plots explains the higher s.e. found in the intercept and slope of
   TAGB and mortality models. The fitted model's effective degrees of
   freedom values consistently show that burned forests' TAGB, mortality
   and Net TAGB response to time are nonlinear, while Wp is linear. For
   Wp, the effective degrees of freedom is equal to 1, meaning linearity
   for Wp in relation to time.

(c) Mortality, recruitment and growth rates at stem level

   Wildfires had persistent effects on burned forest dynamics at stem
   level: from a total of 48 comparisons between burned and unburned
   forests of stem mortality and growth, 16 were significant (p < 0.05)
   and another 5 were marginally significant at p < 0.10 (figures 3 and
   4). These significant results were distributed across all classes of
   time since last fire disturbance, and all classes of tree size and wood
   density.

   Stem mortality was skewed towards zero, but still higher in burned
   forests when compared to unburned forests. The significantly higher
   stem mortality was observed across all tree size and wood density
   classes—but not in all YSLF categories (figures 3a and 4a). The largest
   stem mortality differences between burned and unburned forests were
   observed at 0.75–4 YSF. On average, 22.8 ± 2.4% of trees from small
   classes of size (i.e. 10–19.9 cm DBH) and 23.8 ± 5.0% of trees with the
   lightest wood density (i.e. 0.1–0.49 g cm^−3) died during 0.75–4
   YSLF—these mortality rates were 341 and 239% higher than the equivalent
   size and wood density classes in unburned controls, respectively.
   However, the denser wood stems (i.e. greater than 40 cm DBH; 5–8 YSLF)
   and higher wood density classes (i.e. greater than 0.7 g cm^−3; 0.75–4
   YSLF) were also significantly affected in the burned forest, with
   mortality rates being 680% and 315% higher than unburned controls,
   respectively. Between 9 and 11 years since the wildfires, small size
   stems (i.e. 10–19.9 cm DBH) and stems from small (i.e. 0.1–0.49 g
   cm^−3) and medium (i.e. 0.5–0.69 g cm^−3) classes of wood density
   experienced significantly higher mortality in burned forests—these
   mortality rates were 74%, 173% and 69% higher than unburned controls,
   respectively.

   Stem growth followed a normal distribution, and the mean values of
   burned forests were generally higher than those in unburned forests
   (figure 3b and 4b). The greatest difference in stem growth was observed
   in the small and medium size classes: when compared to unburned
   controls, mean stem growth was 94.1% (5–8 YSLF) and 96.6% (9–11 YSFL)
   higher in burned forests for small size class in the 5–8 and 9–11 YSLF
   categories, respectively, and 54.2% (5–8 YSLF) and 27.0% (9–11 YSFL)
   higher in burned forests for the medium size class at 5–8 and 9–11 YSLF
   categories, respectively. Similarly, for the class of low wood density,
   mean stem growth was 121.1% (5–8 YSLF) and 62.1% (9–11 YSFL) higher in
   burned forests than in unburned forests in the 5–8 and 9–11 YSLF
   categories, respectively. For medium wood density stems, mean stem
   growth was 50.0% higher in burned forests than in unburned forests at
   the 9–11 YSLF category. Finally, for high wood density stems, growth
   was 24.0% and 26.0% higher in burned forests than in unburned forests
   at 5–8 and 9–11 YSF, respectively.

   Stem recruitment was skewed towards zero (electronic supplementary
   material, figure S2). Overall, mean stem recruitment values were
   generally higher in burned than unburned forests up to 12 years since
   last fire (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). There were no
   significant differences between recruitment in burned and unburned
   forests when separated by wood density classes.

4. Discussion

   We provide one of the longest post-fire chronossequence assessements of
   fire-affected Amazonian forests, analysing the most extensive dataset
   to date. Our findings reveal that burned Amazonian forests persist in a
   reduced biomass state for at least 31 years since the last fire, at
   which point they store approximately 25% less TAGB than equivalent
   unburned forests. This decrease in biomass is driven by increases in
   mortality that are not fully compensated for by the relatively small
   changes in recruitment and growth rates (table 1). The high mortality
   in burned forests was not exclusively limited to small diameter and
   light wood trees, but also includes the large-stemmed and hardwood
   trees that contribute most to the carbon stock [30,51,52]. In contrast,
   the positive post-fire growth response was predominantly associated
   with small–medium-sized trees and lighter or intermediate classes of
   wood density—groups that contribute relatively little to overall
   above-ground carbon stocks. We examine these findings in more detail to
   understand how the post-fire changes in dynamics rates influence forest
   biomass in the long-term, and how this is underpinned by mortality,
   recruitment and growth among functional groups. Finally, we discuss the
   prospects of long-term slow recovery of Amazonian fire-affected forests
   and the future of tropical humid forests under the risk of wildfires.

(a) Post-fire changes in forest dynamics and consequences for the long-term
recovery of biomass stocks

   Our data show that long-term reduction on TAGB after fire is
   persistent, but the uncertainties inherent in space-for-time
   comparisons and delayed mortality of large trees mean it only became
   fully evident after 5 years of the fire events. After the initial
   fire-induced mortality, wood productivity rates in burned forests were
   higher than in unburned controls probably because of the increase in
   light and nutrients available to the surviving trees. However, this
   initial short-term increase in wood productivity (plot-level biomass
   gain) does not exceed mortality (plot-level biomass loss) and is
   insufficient to counteract the total biomass losses through mortality
   along the whole chronosequence. Previous studies have raised the
   question of whether enhanced forest growth, promoted by low-intensity
   fires, offsets carbon emissions due to post-fire tree mortality [53].
   Our assessment refutes that suggestion: although burned forests were no
   longer a net carbon source 6 years after fires, the lack of biomass
   accumulation from 6 to 31 years shows they will not recover to pre-fire
   conditions on decadal time scales. Our findings also emphasize the
   importance of longer-term and larger-scale studies to monitor carbon
   dynamics in burned forests, which are particularly important for
   incorporating the variation of mortality and growth rates in C emission
   models.

(b) Post-fire mortality among functional groups with high contribution to
biomass stocks

   Wildfires affected the stem mortality rates of small–medium sized trees
   and all wood density classes in the first YSLF category (0.75–4) of the
   chronosequence. An initial increase in the mortality of high wood
   density trees (315%) compared to unburned forests, combined with a late
   increase in the mortality of large-sized trees (680%), has important
   impacts upon overall AGB loss. A burned forest that has lost its large
   size (figure 3a) and high wood density stems (figure 4a) will
   inevitably store less biomass that it did prior to disturbance
   (figure 2a,e). As well as corroborating previous studies on the late
   increase in mortality of large trees [23], we also show for the first
   time that this process can continue for up to 8 years after
   fire—suggesting that almost all previous studies will have
   underestimated total biomass loss from fires.

   Although previous findings show tree mortality decreased as a function
   of increasing wood density [33], we show that all wood density classes
   are at risk of fire-induced mortality, especially in the first 4 years
   after the burn. It is important to note that our results do not show
   higher susceptibility of high wood density trees compared to lower wood
   density trees to post-fire mortality; instead we show higher stem
   mortality of high wood density trees in burned forests compared to
   unburned controls. One explanation for this high post-fire mortality
   across wood density classes reflects the fact that the full range of
   wood densities can be found in the small (i.e.10.0–19.9 cm DBH) and
   medium (i.e. 20.0–39.9 cm DBH) size classes, which are the
   fire-susceptible groups. Smaller trees are shown to have thinner bark,
   which in turn are at more risk of heat stress and fire-induced
   mortality [11,32].

(c) Post-fire stem gowth and recruitment

   The significant loss of large size and emergent trees is likely to have
   triggered the increase in the growth of light-dependent and
   fast-growing species. As expected, this increase in wood productivity
   is associated with the stem growth responses of small and medium size
   trees from all wood density classes, and to a lesser extent to stem
   recruitment. Although light availability is expected to also benefit
   new recruits [54], stem recruitment is less evident and not
   significantly higher than in undisturbed forest in each individual wood
   density class. However, an ongoing successional process may be
   occurring within burned forests, as components of wood productivity
   (recruitment + growth) were higher compared to unburned (electronic
   supplementary material, table S3, figure S3). Our results suggest that
   pioneer species are colonizing and growing after fire, maintaining a
   natural forest succession process after disturbance. For instance, the
   late stem mortality of small trees (i.e. 10–19.9 cm DBH; 9–11 YSLF) and
   stem growth at mid–long-term (i.e. 5–8 and 9–11 YSLF) observed supports
   the expected post-disturbance forest succession. However, it is
   expected that recruitment of old growth species is limited after fire
   disturbance, which negatively affects the forest's ability to recover
   to its pre-disturbance functional state [29,38]. Consequently, fire
   disturbances are likely to shift forest composition and dynamics for
   much longer than 30 years.

(d) Prospects for forest recovery beyond the time-scale of our data

   Although our data extend to 31 years post-fire, there are reasons to
   expect a slow recovery for many decades beyond this time-frame. First,
   the Net TAGB in burned forests was close to unburned forests'
   equilibrium in the long-term of the chronosequence and did not provide
   any signs of continued recovery. For the recovery to occur gains would
   need to surpass loss during this stage. Second, the fires killed many
   large size and high wood density trees, which will take the longest to
   recover; perhaps unsurprisingly we also found that their
   re-establishment will take longer than 31 years, and many could take
   centuries to recover, given the large trees' age (200–1400 years) in
   undisturbed Amazonian forests [55]. However, other unassessed factors
   could be important and are worthy of further investigation. For
   example, the destruction of the seedbank by fire and a low seedling
   survival may act to limit stem recruitment, as previously found in
   Amazonian flooded forest affected by fire [29]. In addition, any
   surviving seeds from shade-tolerant species are less likely to
   germinate in larger canopy gaps [56]. Finally, the reduced biomass
   stock may be exacerbated by early successional species inhibiting
   emergent and shade-tolerant species on decadal time scales [54].

(e) Post-fire forest recovery limitations and the future of tropical humid
forests under the risk of wildfires

   Forest disturbance from fires may interact with a changing climate. For
   example, burned forests have a more open canopy that allows solar
   radiation to penetrate. The increasing temperature in the interior of
   burned forests results in the increase of vapour pressure deficit and
   evapotranspiration, further exacerbating soil drying [7,57]. At the
   same time, the Amazon has seen an increase in drought conditions,
   limiting water availability [58] and potentially limiting the
   recruitment of trees [59]. Although Amazonian forests seem to be
   resilient to dry conditions, it is likely that water limitation can
   limit their recovery from fire disturbances [58,60]. Whether post-fire
   succession is permanently arrested or is just occurring at a very slow
   rate is difficult to ascertain based on the temporal scale of our
   dataset. As we only assessed individuals ≥10 cm DBH within 31 years
   since the last fires, we are unlikely to detect longer-term recovery or
   the re-establishment of slow-growing (high wood density) species.
   However, it is notable that assessments of saplings and seed banks in
   disturbed Amazonian forests indicate a slowdown or stalled forest
   recovery [29,38], and the stabilization of recovery after wildfires is
   in marked contrast to the consistent increases in forest biomass
   observed in the first decades after the disturbance in selectively
   logged or secondary forests [61–63].

   Considering the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme
   events—such as the 2015/2016 El Niño—associated with increasing fire
   incidence [5], our findings highlight the urgent need to avoid fires in
   humid tropical forests. Our study also provides the largest
   ground-based assessment on patterns of post-fire forest recovery, which
   is particularly important considering the role of the Amazon in the
   global carbon cycle. Moreover, in our effort to cover the heterogeneity
   of once-burned forests subjected to similar fire intensities, our
   estimates describe a general response of Amazonian old-growth Terra
   Firme forests to fire disturbance. However, it is important to state
   that we investigated the effect of a single fire event on forest
   dynamics and biomass stocks through time. Recurrent fires are still
   somewhat rare in the Amazon—in 2010, they only accounted for 16% of all
   wildfires [64]. However, recurrent fires are likely to become
   increasingly prevalent across the Amazon, given the synergies between a
   drier and hotter climate, the pervasive use of fire in agriculture [65]
   and the human-induced disturbances such as selective logging that
   render forests more vulnerable to fires due to changes in the
   microclimate [2,11]. The combination of these factors will also affect
   the ability of forests to recover from fire disturbance.

   The only fully coupled land–atmosphere global climate model predicts a
   widespread dieback of Amazonian forest cover through reduced
   precipitation. Although these predictions are controversial, the
   structural and compositional resilience of Amazonian forests may also
   have been overestimated, as current vegetation models fail to consider
   the potential role of fire in the degradation of forest ecosystems. We
   examine forest structure and composition in the Arapiuns River basin in
   the central Brazilian Amazon, evaluating post-fire forest recovery and
   the consequences of recurrent fires for the patterns of dominance of
   tree species. We surveyed tree plots in unburned and once-burned
   forests examined 1, 3 and 9 years after an unprecedented fire event, in
   twice-burned forests examined 3 and 9 years after fire and in
   thrice-burned forests examined 5 years after the most recent fire
   event. The number of trees recorded in unburned primary forest control
   plots was stable over time. However, in both once- and twice-burned
   forest plots, there was a marked recruitment into the 10–20 cm diameter
   at breast height tree size classes between 3 and 9 years post-fire.
   Considering tree assemblage composition 9 years after the first fire
   contact, we observed (i) a clear pattern of community turnover among
   small trees and the most abundant shrubs and saplings, and (ii) that
   species that were common in any of the four burn treatments (unburned,
   once-, twice- and thrice-burned) were often rare or entirely absent in
   other burn treatments. We conclude that episodic wildfires can lead to
   drastic changes in forest structure and composition, with cascading
   shifts in forest composition following each additional fire event.
   Finally, we use these results to evaluate the validity of the
   savannization paradigm.

1. Introduction

   The only fully coupled land–atmosphere global climate model that is
   currently available predicts a large-scale and substantial reduction in
   precipitation over the Amazon Basin during the twenty-first century,
   leading to a widespread dieback of forest vegetation (Betts et al.
   2004; Cox et al. 2004). These catastrophic predictions are highly
   controversial, not least because the thresholds for drought-mediated
   dieback remain highly uncertain, and are currently based upon a single
   digital vegetation model (TRIFFID) that is not consistent with the
   long-term historical stability of core Amazonian forests (Haberle &
   Maslin 1999; Sternberg 2001) and may underestimate forest resilience to
   drought (e.g. Nepstad et al. 2007; Saleska et al. 2007).

   Conversely, the structural and compositional resilience of Amazonian
   forests may have been overestimated, as the vegetation models fail to
   consider the potential role of fire in the degradation of forest
   ecosystems (Betts et al. 2004). Fire plays a significant role in
   tropical ecosystems and is a major evolutionary force shaping the
   structure and composition of forests worldwide (Bond & Keeley 2005),
   and the geographical extent of many tropical rainforests is limited by
   fire as well as edaphic and climatic factors (Bowman 2000; Hoffmann &
   Moreira 2002; Russell-Smith et al. 2004). Furthermore, most tropical
   rainforest trees are poorly adapted to fire stress, and even
   low-intensity forest wildfires can lead to the mortality of more than
   40% of stems 10 cm and above in diameter at breast height (DBH; see
   Barlow & Peres (2006a) for a review of studies).

   Many of the ongoing and predicted changes in the Amazonian climate
   increase the risk of fires spreading into forests. For example, climate
   change is likely to be accompanied by increased air temperature and dry
   season length over large regions of the Amazon forest (Cox et al.
   2004), and a probable increased frequency of severe seasonal droughts
   initiated by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and Atlantic
   sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (Li et al. 2006). These severe
   supra-annual droughts are known to both augment and further desiccate
   the available fuel load, forcing forests over the flammability
   threshold (Nepstad et al. 2004; Ray et al. 2005) with potentially
   disastrous consequences. An estimated 20 Mha of tropical forest in
   South America and Southeast Asia succumbed to drought-induced fires as
   a consequence of the 1997–1998 ENSO event (see Barbosa & Fearnside
   1999; Cochrane et al. 1999; Siegert et al. 2001; Page et al. 2002;
   Cochrane 2003; Alencar et al. 2006), and the extreme 2005
   drought—triggered primarily by elevated middle Atlantic SST
   anomalies—led to a rapid proliferation of fires in normally
   fire-resistant parts of southwestern Amazonia (Aragão et al. 2008).

   Many of the ongoing changes in anthropogenic activity either facilitate
   or directly increase the spread of fire (Cardoso et al. 2003). For
   example, large-scale forest clearance leads to reduced precipitation
   (Oyama & Nobre 2003), and edge creation and selective logging increase
   forest flammability (Uhl & Buschbacher 1985; Nepstad et al. 1999;
   Cochrane & Laurance 2002; Alencar et al. 2006). Moreover, many
   deforested areas are subsequently replaced by secondary forests (e.g.
   Lucas et al. 2000), which can become rapidly desiccated and flammable
   during dry periods (Ray et al. 2005). Finally, the increased physical
   access across previously undisturbed parts of the Amazon through
   mega-development projects (e.g. Peres 2001) encourages the immigration
   and spread of human populations dominated by small-scale farmers who
   routinely use fires to clear agricultural plots (e.g. Nepstad et al.
   2001; Cardoso et al. 2003). This frontier expansion increases the
   susceptibility of forests to fires and provides the ignition sources
   that are responsible for initiating most fires.

   The aim of this paper is to assess the potential fate of the Amazon
   forest under drier climatic conditions by examining the long-term
   consequences of contemporary wildfires. We evaluate post-fire forest
   recovery and the consequences of recurrent fires for the patterns of
   dominance of tree species by surveying tree plots in unburned and
   once-burned forests examined 1, 3 and 9 years after fire, in
   twice-burned forests examined 3 and 9 years after fire and in
   thrice-burned forests examined 5 years after the most recent fire
   event. Specifically, we evaluate the post-fire forest recovery
   trajectories in terms of stem density, and the consequences of
   recurrent fires for the abundance of the dominant tree species.
   Finally, we use this novel dataset to re-evaluate the potential outcome
   of a widespread fire-mediated vegetation dieback in terms of a largely
   irreversible phase shift in Amazonian forest ecosystems.

2. Material and methods

   This study took place in the Rio Maró basin of westernmost Pará,
   central Brazilian Amazonia (2°44′ S, 55°41′ W). This region is
   dominated by dense lowland non-flooded (terra firme) forests, but
   includes small enclaves of edaphic savannahs (campinarana) on
   white-sand soils, and narrow portions of seasonally flooded forests
   (igapó) along the Rio Maró. The forest plots inventoried in this study
   are classified as yellow latosols of medium texture (according to the
   Brazilian soil classification system; EMBRAPA 1981), and have a high
   (but variable) sand fraction and a relatively low moisture retention
   capacity (J. Barlow & C. Peres 1998, unpublished data). The climate is
   characterized by a rainfall of 2041 mm yr^−1 (range 1287–2538 mm yr^−1;
   1992–1997) and a strongly demarcated dry season lasting three to five
   months (see Barlow & Peres 2006b).

   The modern history of forest wildfires in this region dates from the
   early 1990s, when fires escaped from ‘roçados’ (small agricultural
   clearings) into the surrounding forest. Arguably, the most important
   fire events in the twentieth century occurred between October and
   December 1997, at the end of the longest dry season in living memory.
   These fires affected ∼1100 km^2 of logged and unlogged primary forests,
   previously burned forests (providing our twice-burned treatment) and
   secondary forests in the Rio Arapiuns–Maró basin (Peres 1999; Nelson
   2001). Additional severe dry seasons (especially 2001–2002) have led to
   recent wildfires in the last decade (providing our thrice-burned
   treatment), but these fires were less extensive and more patchy than
   those of late 1997.

   In 2007, we recensused twelve 0.25 ha forest plots (10×250 m) that had
   been examined at least once previously, including four plots located in
   unburned forests, four in once-burned forests, two in twice-burned
   forests and two in thrice-burned forests. The unburned and once-burned
   plots were established in 1998–1999, one year after the 1997–1998
   fires, and were resampled both 3 and 9 years after these fires (in
   2001–2002 and 2007). The twice-burned forest plots first burned in the
   early 1990s, and were first sampled 3 years after the second fire (in
   2001–2002) and resampled 9 years after the second fire (in 2007). The
   thrice-burned forest plots were sampled in 2007, 5 years after they had
   burned for the third time. Where our previously georeferenced
   rectangular plots were no longer obvious (i.e. in twice-burned
   forests), the transect points marking the beginning and the end of each
   plot were relocated using a global positioning system and its original
   compass bearing.

   We recorded all trees and lianas 10 cm and above in DBH in each plot,
   but excluded those stems with more than half of their basal trunk
   outside the plot. Diameter measurements were taken at breast height
   (approx. 1.3 m), or immediately above the tallest buttress whenever
   this exceeded 1.3 m. During the 2007 field campaign, measured stems
   were identified to the level of family, genus or species by J.B., based
   on personal knowledge, local names provided by a highly experienced
   field assistant, and following Gentry (1993) and Ribeiro et al. (1999).
   At the same time, we also identified all common species of shrubs and
   saplings above 1 m in height and below 10 cm in DBH in twelve 1×50 m
   subplots, with four subplots placed in each unburned and burned forest
   treatment. We did not count bamboo stems or other non-woody vegetation,
   although their abundance varied considerably in different burned
   forests (figure 2).

   Voucher specimens were not collected, and we restrict our analysis of
   species composition to the most abundant stems (defined as stems with a
   density greater than 10 trees ha^−1), using a coarse-scale level of
   identification to emphasize the broad patterns of compositional change
   and minimize error. As we are primarily interested in evaluating
   patterns of regeneration responses in terms of the abundance of stems
   resulting from the most recent fire event, our examination of changes
   in composition (table 1) focuses on the smaller stem classes (10–20 cm
   in DBH) and saplings below 10 cm in DBH. This analysis of a limited
   number of plots is designed to provide a preliminary evaluation of
   patterns of change, and present working hypotheses that can be tested
   by studies of long-term forest dynamics based on marked trees, and by
   wider-scale and well-replicated examinations of post-fire regeneration
   across the Amazon Basin.

3. Results

(a) Changes in stem density

   The stem density recorded in unburned primary forest control sites was
   stable over time, and there was no significant change in the total
   number of trees recorded or in any of the five individual size classes
   (figure 1a; Kruskall–Wallis tests, p>0.6 for all comparisons within
   size classes). We therefore compared the number of trees in each size
   class in burned forest plots with the average number (across years) of
   trees recorded in unburned primary forest plots for the same size
   class.

   In once-burned forests, there was a decline in the abundance of live
   trees in both the smallest (10–20 cm DBH) and largest (50 cm and above
   DBH) size classes between 1 and 3 years after fire (figure 1b; see also
   Barlow et al. (2003b), which include data from three additional plots
   that had since been clear-cut and could not be sampled in 2007). There
   was strong recruitment into the 10–20 cm DBH size classes between 3 and
   9 years post-fire, and the abundance of these smaller stems was
   approaching the numbers recorded in primary forests. There was little
   evidence of any significant change in the abundance of stems in the
   larger size classes (20 cm and above in DBH) between 3 and 9 years
   after the fires, although the variance among replicate plots was high
   (figure 1b).

   Within twice-burned forests, there was a marked recruitment of stems
   into the 10–20 cm DBH size class between 3 and 9 years post-fire. There
   was a slight increase in stems 20–30 cm in DBH over the same period,
   but no discernible trends were observed in other size classes (figure
   1c). Thrice-burned plots that burned for the last time in 2001–2002 had
   fewer trees across most size classes than twice-burned forests, but
   this was especially noticeable in the smaller (10–30 cm DBH) and larger
   (50 cm and above DBH) size classes.

(b) Changes in stem composition

   There was a clear pattern of tree community turnover among the most
   common stems of small trees in the 10–20 cm DBH size class. For
   example, the dominant morphospecies in unburned primary forests were
   always substantially less abundant in once-burned forests, and very
   scarce, if not entirely absent, in twice- and thrice-burned forests
   (table 1). Once-burned forest plots were dominated by long-lived
   pioneers, such as Cecropia spp. and Jacaranda copaia, which were not
   recorded in unburned primary forests and were either much less abundant
   or absent from twice- and thrice-burned forests (table 1). Twice-burned
   forests were dominated by Pseudobombax sp., which was absent from
   unburned and once-burned forests, and thrice-burned forests were
   dominated by Cordia sp., which were only infrequently recorded in other
   burn classes.

   A similar pattern of plant community turnover was evident with the
   shrubs and saplings (above 1 m tall and below 10 cm in DBH), many of
   which reached reproductive maturity in the understorey. The most
   abundant species recorded in once-burned forests (Palicourea
   guianensis) was rarely recorded elsewhere, and the most abundant
   species in twice-burned forests (Aparisthmium cordatum) was much less
   abundant in once- and thrice-burned forests. Finally, the most abundant
   species in thrice-burned forests (Cordia sp.) was rarely encountered
   elsewhere in any of the undisturbed or other fire-disturbed treatments
   (table 1; figure 2).

4. Discussion

   Data presented in this study provide novel insights into the ecological
   consequences of repeated fire disturbance in Amazonian seasonally dry
   forests. Our principal observation is that repeated pulses of
   fire-induced tree mortality lead to a rapid collapse in the abundance
   of old-growth trees, and a community turnover that is analogous to the
   ‘secondarization’ of primary forests (figures 2 and 3), with
   significant shifts in forest composition occurring with each
   consecutive fire event. This fire-mediated cascade in the species
   composition of Amazonian forests is underpinned by five interrelated
   processes.
    i. Loss of primary forest species. Many studies have documented the
       intrinsic vulnerability of primary forest trees to fire stress
       (e.g. Uhl & Kauffman 1990; Pinard & Huffman 1997; Cochrane &
       Schulze 1999; Barlow et al. 2003a,b). Fires may promote the
       secondarization or impoverishment of large areas of forests by
       acting as local extinction filters, extirpating species that are
       unable to tolerate thermal stress induced by fire contact. The
       consequences of this sudden selective pressure in core Amazonian
       forests are evident by the generally lower rates of fire-mediated
       tree mortality along the phytogeographic fringes of the Amazon (see
       Barlow & Peres 2006a), where forests close to savannah ecosystems
       have been more frequently exposed to fire disturbance.
       Figure 3
       Figure 3 Vertical cross-sectional profiles representing the
       sequential ‘secondarization’ of repeatedly burned forests in
       central Amazonia. This trajectory departs from (a) an unburned
       closed-canopy forest to (b) a once-burned open-canopy forest where
       nearly half of the canopy trees had been either damaged or killed,
       to (c) a twice- or thrice-burned forest that resembles young
       secondary forests growing on degraded land. This forest
       secondarization process involves a number of drastic changes in
       forest structure and composition, including severe loss of biomass,
       loss of vertical structure resulting from upper canopy thinning and
       the loss of emergent trees, hyper-proliferation of pioneers, rapid
       compositional turnover and seed-bank simplification (see text).

   ii. Changes in forest regeneration patterns. Our results suggest that
       episodic patterns of post-burn tree recruitment are strongly
       influenced by the number of times a forest had burned, with a
       different suite of pioneer species dominating the vegetation
       composition after each fire event (table 1). This may be due to the
       fire-induced destruction of the residual seed bank, mortality of
       entire cohorts of pioneer species, post-burn availability of
       diaspore sources, seed and seedling predation, soil infertility and
       competition with grasses and ruderal species, all of which can
       alter the rates of forest regrowth and biomass accumulation, and,
       under extreme conditions, deflect or arrest successional processes.
       Although these patterns could also be explained by a stochastic
       founder effect, with the most abundant species being those that
       colonized first after each recurrent fire, this alternative
       explanation is less likely as it fails to explain the almost
       complete absence of long-lived pioneers in areas that have
       undergone recurrent fires.
   iii. Susceptibility of pioneer species to fire. The pulse of plant
       recruitment dominated by long-lived pioneers following
       low-intensity surface fires provides a dense regrowth that may
       partly compensate for the loss of primary forest tree and liana
       species, even though the composition and structure of the forest
       remains very different from unburned forests (figures 1b and 2b).
       However, these long-lived pioneer species are themselves highly
       vulnerable to any subsequent fire (which in any case tends to
       consume more fuel and is more intensive). For example, pioneers
       that were common in once-burned forests (such as J. copaia and
       Cecropia spp.) were much less abundant or entirely absent in
       forests that had succumbed to recurrent fires (table 1). These
       species also suffer some of the highest mortality rates (compared
       with any tree species) following low-intensity understorey fires in
       other Amazonian primary forests (Pinard et al. 1999; Ivanauskas et
       al. 2003). The enhanced susceptibility of the dominant tree species
       regenerating after a single low-intensity fire event increases the
       overall plant mortality rate in forests that burn more intensively
       for a second time, thus reinforcing the positive feedback cycle in
       which recurrent fires erode the vegetation structure of previously
       unburned forests (cf. Cochrane et al. 1999; Nepstad et al. 1999).
   iv. Vulnerability of resprouting stems to fire. The ability to resprout
       following disturbance provides many trees with a mechanism to
       survive fire events, and these regenerating stems play a crucial
       role in fostering a species-rich regeneration (Guariguata &
       Ostertag 2001). However, these resprouting stems are themselves
       highly vulnerable to subsequent fire stress (Uhl et al. 1981),
       further exacerbating the process of impoverishment and
       secondarization of tropical primary forests that undergo more than
       one fire event.
    v. Changes in the availability of seed dispersal agents and seed
       shadows. In addition to their direct effects on forest structure
       and composition, fires are likely to play a more subtle long-term
       role in determining the future forest dynamics and composition, as
       recurrent fires also have a devastating effect on animal
       populations, including many of the large-bodied vertebrates that
       disperse large-seeded species (Peres et al. 2003; Barlow & Peres
       2004, 2006b). Local extinctions and population declines in
       mid-sized to large-bodied frugivores—resulting from both the
       short-term mortality in the aftermath of fires and the long-term
       changes in habitat quality (e.g. structure and food supplies)—have
       both qualitative and quantitative consequences to patterns of seed
       dispersal in repeatedly burned forests. These are likely to
       aggravate dispersal limitation of propagules in many large-seeded
       endozoochorous plants, while favouring small-seeded and
       wind-dispersed plants (Stoner et al. 2007; Wright et al. 2007).
       This is essentially analogous to changes in animal-mediated seed
       dispersal in comparatively better-understood scenarios of forests
       that were semi-defaunated by overhunting, where the availability of
       seed vectors is depressed without major changes in habitat
       structure (Peres & Palacios 2007).

5. Patterns of tree mortality

   Our data from a small number of forest plots support other tropical
   forest studies that demonstrate high rates of post-fire tree mortality
   (See Barlow & Peres (2006a) for a summary of mortality from 14
   studies), and provide further evidence that tree mortality may be
   highest in both the smallest and largest size classes (see also
   Williams et al. 1999; Barlow et al. 2003b). We do not attempt to
   estimate the loss of forest biomass (and committed carbon emissions) in
   this study, as accurate estimates would require information on (i) soil
   carbon pools, (ii) non-lethal tree damage, (iii) lowered biomass of
   senescing trees (Chambers et al. 2001), and (iv) wood density of
   different species (particularly regenerating pioneers). However, these
   data clearly demonstrate that forest fires have the potential to offset
   any potential carbon sink from the Amazon forest (cf. Barlow & Peres
   2004) and further contribute to increasing global carbon emissions
   (Lewis 2006).

6. Evaluating the savannization paradigm

   Various terms have been used to describe the predicted ‘dieback’ of
   Amazonian forests. We recorded five such terms stated by climatologists
   and forest ecologists at the fate of the Amazon conference in Oxford
   (March 2007; this issue), including ‘savannization’, ‘pasteurization’,
   ‘desertification’, ‘secondarization’ and ‘scrubification’. Different
   terms are inevitable where there is regional variability in the nature
   of threats, and different authors have slightly different world views
   on the nature of the process involved (cf. Verstraete 1986). However,
   we argue that some of the current terms describing climate-related
   ecosystem transitions (such as savannization and desertification) are
   misleading and technically inaccurate because their outcomes are driven
   solely by the direct effects of climate change on vegetation and they
   fail to consider indirect mortality rates (mediated through fire).

   It is our view that any increase in dry season length brought about
   through climate change is highly likely to be accompanied by widespread
   increases in forest flammability (Nepstad et al. 2004) and subsequent
   large-scale fire events (e.g. Cochrane 2003; Aragão et al. 2008). It is
   well established that these fires bring about severe compositional and
   structural changes in Amazonian forests (e.g. this study; Cochrane &
   Schulze 1998, 1999; Barlow & Peres 2004). These changes are likely to
   be significantly more severe than changes in forest structure and
   composition that could occur through drought stress under moderate
   scenarios of climate change, especially considering that Amazonian
   forests appear to be more resilient to drought stress than previously
   thought (Nepstad et al. 2007; Saleska et al. 2007).

   If we accept that fire will be an integral part of climate-driven
   ecosystem change, then how would Amazonian forests look in a hotter,
   drier future? Our data provide a unique insight and suggest that
   recurrent fires can lead to an ecosystem phase shift from pristine
   closed-canopy primary forests to more open forests dominated by
   short-lived pioneer species, which reflects patterns observed in humid
   tropical forests disturbed by logging, fires and edge effects elsewhere
   (Slik et al. 2002; Santos et al. 2007). In particular, these forests
   are not dominated by woody species typical of natural neotropical
   savannahs (as implied by the savannization paradigm), but are more
   similar to young secondary forests regenerating on degraded lands. The
   changes brought about by fire involve a number of drastic alterations
   in forest structure and composition that clearly mimics the ephemeral
   formation of young second-growth stands, including a severe collapse in
   forest phytomass, loss of vertical structure resulting from severe
   upper canopy thinning and the loss of emergent trees,
   hyper-proliferation of pioneers, rapid compositional turnover and
   seed-bank simplification (figure 3). This structural collapse is
   accompanied by a severe functional impoverishment in the life-history
   traits of residual stands with profound consequences for ecosystem
   services such as carbon retention and water cycling. For example, the
   high diversity of slow-growing shade-tolerant trees typical of
   unburned, old-growth forests (e.g. large-seeded, emergent and hardwood
   tree species) is rapidly replaced by a small dominant set of
   persistent, fast-growing pioneer species that accrue a low biomass due
   to their smaller size and low wood density.

7. Conclusion

   This paper outlines the long-term consequences of forest fires in one
   region of the Brazilian Amazon, and shows how fires drastically alter
   forest structure and composition, leading to a rapid impoverishment of
   even previously intact primary forests over a relatively short period
   of time. Such fires are likely to have long-term impacts on tree
   species composition even if recurrent fires can be prevented through
   effective fire suppression practices. For example, many modern tropical
   forests show evidence of catastrophic disturbance events (Baker et al.
   2005; Pitman et al. 2005), and compositional recovery from forest
   disturbance, when observed over longer time scales, is always slow and
   of the order of hundreds of years, if not millennia (Turner et al.
   1997; Charles-Dominique et al. 2003; Pitman et al. 2005).

   These results clearly highlight the importance of preventing fires from
   spreading further into new Amazonian forest frontiers. Although biomass
   burning is widely practised by virtually all rural peoples in the
   Amazon, it is also one of the few aspects of climate change mitigation
   over which we retain some direct control. Some small-scale agricultural
   projects have been highly successful in reducing the use of fire in
   Amazonian smallholdings (e.g. see Silva et al. (2006) and the project
   ‘Roça sem queimar’). Expanding and developing these projects to reduce
   the availability of ignition sources should be an urgent conservation
   priority over the coming decades.

   We are very thankful to the Peter Fleming Award from the Royal
   Geographical Society for funding the 2007 fieldwork, and the villagers
   and community leaders at Cachoeira do Maró and São José III along the
   Rio Maró, and São José II along the Rio Arapiuns. J.B. carried out the
   fieldwork while funded by a CNPq postdoctoral fellowship at the Museu
   Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG), Brazil. We thank Phil Judge for
   preparing figure 3 and Toby Gardner, Mark Cochrane and one anonymous
   reviewer for their useful comments on the manuscript.

Abstract

   Changes in climate and land use that interact synergistically to
   increase fire frequencies and intensities in tropical regions are
   predicted to drive forests to new grass-dominated stable states. To
   reveal the mechanisms for such a transition, we established 50 ha plots
   in a transitional forest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon to
   different fire treatments (unburned, burned annually (B1yr) or at
   3-year intervals (B3yr)). Over an 8-year period since the commencement
   of these treatments, we documented: (i) the annual rate of pasture and
   native grass invasion in response to increasing fire frequency; (ii)
   the establishment of Brachiaria decumbens (an African C[4] grass) as a
   function of decreasing canopy cover and (iii) the effects of grass fine
   fuel on fire intensity. Grasses invaded approximately 200 m from the
   edge into the interiors of burned plots (B1yr: 4.31 ha; B3yr: 4.96 ha)
   but invaded less than 10 m into the unburned plot (0.33 ha). The
   probability of B. decumbens establishment increased with seed
   availability and decreased with leaf area index. Fine fuel loads along
   the forest edge were more than three times higher in grass-dominated
   areas, which resulted in especially intense fires. Our results indicate
   that synergies between fires and invasive C[4] grasses jeopardize the
   future of tropical forests.

1. Introduction

   In many parts of the world, tropical forest–savannah boundaries shift
   in response to changing climate and disturbance regimes [1,2]. In the
   southern Amazon Basin, forest is predicted to retreat owing to climate
   change [3,4] and land-use practices [5,6], which may also facilitate
   grass invasion and increase both the frequencies and intensities of
   wildfires. Although some dynamic global vegetation models predict a
   late-century Amazonian forest dieback [7,8], an integrated view of how
   this process will occur is still lacking. One potent driver could be
   the increased forest edge invasion of exotic grasses that accompanies
   pasture expansion [5]. In addition, fires reportedly interact with
   grass invasion through a positive feedback cycle, which causes a
   decline in tree cover, facilitates grass invasion and increases the
   likelihood of future fires [9–11].

   Grass–fire cycles are important on many forest frontiers owing to the
   combination of increased ignitions, drier forest edges and
   proliferation of flammable species. For example, several studies
   document that establishment of invasive grasses, which benefits from
   reduced tree cover [6,12], increases fine fuel loads, fire intensities
   [13,14] and grass expansion [6,12–14]. Moreover, frequently burned
   forests lose carbon storage capacity and may remain in a degraded,
   low-carbon forest state in which they are susceptible to recurrent
   fires [15].

   There is a wealth of knowledge about forest–savannah boundary dynamics
   around the world and about how introduced grasses alter vegetation and
   help create new fire cycles [1,12,13,16]. However, the mechanisms by
   which grasses expand at the expense of forests are less well understood
   (but see [11]). In the southeastern Amazon, agricultural expansion
   [17], selective logging [18] and other land uses may accelerate the
   rate of reduction of forest cover and enhance the fire–grass cycle by:
   (i) reducing tree cover and exposing vulnerable forest edges
   [10,19–21]; (ii) introducing propagules of exotic pasture grasses
   [11,22]; and (iii) increasing ignitions associated with land management
   practices [18,23].

   Although the importance of fire–grass feedbacks for tropical forests
   and savannahs is well established [6,9–14], little is known about the
   mechanisms by which grasses invade forests. In particular, the species
   composition, extent and fire-related traits that facilitate this
   process along the substantial amount of degraded forest edges created
   annually by deforestation need to be documented. In this study, we
   experimentally evaluated how two fire frequencies (an annual and
   triennial burn) and the resulting differences in canopy cover interact
   with grass invasion to change fire behaviour. Specifically, we tested
   the predictions that: (i) native cerrado (Brazilian savannah) and
   exotic pasture grass invasion of forests from the edge increases with
   increases in fire frequency and associated increases in light
   availability; (ii) the establishment of the exotic grass Brachiaria
   decumbens from seeds experimentally sown in the forest interior (250 m
   from forest edges) increases with canopy openness; and (iii) the
   presence of exotic grasses increases forest fire intensity.

2. Material and methods

(a) Study area

   In 2004, we established a large-scale fire experiment in a transitional
   forest located between the cerrado and Amazon forest biomes (figure 1).
   This forest showed no signs of previous disturbance by fire or logging
   and was located in a privately owned ranch in Mato Grosso (13°04′ S,
   52°23′ W). The soils in this region are dystrophic red-yellow Oxisols
   that are deep and well drained [24]. The average annual precipitation
   of 1700 mm falls predominantly during the October–May rainy season.
   This forest is less diverse than most wet and moist forests, with only
   97 woody species ha^−1 greater than 10 cm diameter at breast height
   [24]; nine of these species represent 56 per cent of the stems [19].

(b) Fire experiment

   Grass invasion was monitored in a large-scale fire experiment
   consisting of three 50 ha adjacent plots: one burned annually from 2004
   to 2010 (except in 2008; B1yr); one burned every 3 years (2004, 2007
   and 2010; B3yr) and an unburned control (figure 1). These large plot
   sizes allowed us to simulate realistic fires, but did not allow for
   replication. To deal with this limitation, we conducted pre-fire
   measurements and established a control plot, following protocols for
   large-scale unreplicated experiments [25,26]. The experimental burns
   were all conducted at the end of the dry season (August–September).

   The plots bordered pastures until 2006 and soya bean fields afterwards.
   The dominant grasses in these pastures were B. decumbens Stapf and
   Andropogon gayanus Kunth, both of which are native to Africa. African
   grasses were not present in the forest interior before the experimental
   fires. However, cerrado native grasses (mainly Aristida longifolia;
   electronic supplementary material, S1) were present along the forest
   edges prior to fires (less than 5 m), as observed in the control
   (figure 2). For more details about the fire experiment, see Balch et
   al. [10,19,24] and Brando et al. [27].

(c) General approach for grass invasion monitoring

   To evaluate the determinants and rates of grass invasion in our
   fire-disturbed experiment, we made two sets of measurements. We first
   measured grass invasion from the edge into the forest interior annually
   from 2004 to 2011 in the control, B1yr and B3yr. In 2012, we
   complemented this measurement by mapping the presence of grasses within
   250 m of the forest edge at a resolution of 5 × 5 m (referred to as
   forest-edge grass invasion) for the control and fire treatment plots.
   Second, in 2010, we established thirty 100 m long transects (10 per 50
   ha plot treatment) along which we estimated the percentage of grass
   cover and the leaf area index (LAI) of the overstorey (referred to as
   grass presence). More details about these two set of measurements
   follow below.

(i) Forest-edge grass invasion

   We measured the rate of grass invasion from the forest edge into the
   interior of each plot 11–12 months following each experimental burn
   conducted between 2005 and 2011. We mapped the furthest penetration of
   grass populations along edge-to-interior transects placed every 4 m (n
   = 125 per plot; details in Balch et al. [10]).To estimate the area
   invaded by each species, in July 2012, we mapped all areas with greater
   than 50 per cent grass cover that occurred within 250 m of the nearest
   forest edge (see the electronic supplementary material, S1; figure 2).

(ii) Grass presence

   We estimated percentage grass cover along 30 transects of 100 m in 2010
   (10 in each experimental plots) running from the plot edge bordering
   the field into the forest interior. For each transect, we mapped
   percentage grass cover (as illustrated in top-right in figure 1) and
   LAI. Because we measured LAI at discrete points along the transects (0,
   10, 30, 50 and 100 m away from edge), we interpolated the LAI using the
   kriging method described in Pebesma [28] to relate LAI to grass cover.

(d) Experimental manipulation of Brachiaria decumbens populations

   To evaluate some factors affecting the establishment of B. decumbens,
   we conducted a seed-sowing experiment in the forest interior (greater
   than 250 m from the forest edge), where no pasture grasses were
   previously present. First, in 2008, we measured LAI in B1yr over 600
   points using a LiCor 2000 [29]. Second, we divided the experimental
   area into three LAI classes: low (less than 2.0); medium (2.0–4.0); and
   high (greater than 4.0). Third, within every LAI class, we established
   five blocks comprising three treatments each: a control with no seed
   inputs; a treatment in which seeds were sown (SEED); and another
   treatment in which seeds were sown and buried by a rake after the
   litter layer was removed to increase seed contact with the mineral soil
   (BARE). Thus, the experiment consisted of 45 circular plots of 50 m^2
   each, with treatments randomly allocated within LAI classes (figure 1).
   About 150 viable seeds per square metre of B. decumbens were sown
   during the rainy seasons of November 2008 and December 2010. We
   evaluated grass presence and grass cover 6 months after the seeds were
   sown, and then 2 years after the last planting (February 2012).

(e) Grass effects on fire behaviour

   At the end of the 2010 dry season, we classified forest edges on the
   basis of the dominant vegetation: (i) andropogon (A. gayanus), an
   African C[4] grass commonly planted in pastures; (ii) cuandu, a native
   C[3] grass (A. longifolia), common in Brazilian savannahs [30]; and
   (iii) mixed vegetation cover, where lianas and sprouts of different
   woody species were dominant. Within each one of these vegetation types,
   and in the forest interior (greater than 250 m from forest edges), we
   quantified the following proxies for forest flammability 5–10 min prior
   to conducting the experimental fires: (i) fine fuel height (n = 20)
   using a graduated scale; (ii) fine fuel biomass in 1-m^2 plots (n =
   6–70); and (iii) fine fuel moisture content (n = 6–100). At the same
   time, we also measured air temperature and relative humidity using a
   psychrometer (n = 7–20), and wind direction and speed using a manual
   anemometer. Finally, we measured flame heights (m) and fire spread
   rates (m min^−1; FSR) on forest edges and in their interiors.

(f) Statistical analysis

   We used logistic models to assess the probability of grass invasion in
   the Grass presence and in Establishment of B. decumbens experiments.
   First, we developed a model of grass presence as a function of LAI and
   distance from the edge (model I). Then, we estimated the probability of
   B. decumbens presence as a function of LAI, seed treatments, proportion
   of exposed mineral soil and litter thickness (model II). The best
   models were assumed to be those with the lowest Akaike information
   criterion [31]. In the text, we present means followed by standard
   deviations (s.d.) or, in the case of right-skewed distributions,
   medians followed by the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI).

3. Results

(a) Grass invasion into the forest

   The rate of grass invasion was low during the first years of the fire
   experiment but then increased substantially, particularly after the
   high-intensity fires of 2007 (see figure 3 and electronic supplementary
   material, S2). During the 3 years following the initial fires in 2004,
   for example, grasses invaded only short distances in both fire
   treatments (1.6–1.9 m ± 0.25–3.69 (± 1 s.d.) yr^−1) and in the control
   (0.3 m ± 0.20 (± 1 s.d.) yr^−1). Between 2008 and 2011, by contrast,
   the rate of grass invasion increased substantially in the burned plots
   to 13.0 m ± 10.94 (±1 s.d.) yr^−1 in B1yr and 19.9 m ± 37.76 (±1 s.d.)
   yr^−1 in B3yr. Although there was a fourfold increase in grass invasion
   of the control plot, the rate was much lower than in the burned plots
   (1.2 m ± 3.74).

   The effects of fire frequency on grass invasion changed over time in
   the burned plots. In general, grass invasion rates were similar between
   plots for the period 2005–2007. In the year following the 2007 fires,
   by contrast, grasses advanced faster in B1yr than in B3yr. In 2010, the
   rates of grass invasion were 37 per cent lower in B3yr than in B1yr. By
   contrast, the rates of grass invasion were higher in B3yr than in B1yr
   in 2009 (13%) and 2011 (4%) (see figure 3 and electronic supplementary
   material, S2).

   By 2012, the total area invaded by grasses was 4.31 ha in B1yr, 4.96 ha
   in B3yr and 0.33 ha in the control (mostly less than 10 m from the
   edge; figure 2). The main grass species in B3yr were A. longifolia
   (38%), Pennisetum sp. (30%) and A. gayanus (10%). In B1yr, these same
   species were present along the forest edge, but the species dominance
   differed from B3yr: A. longifolia (82%) and A. gayanus (15%), while in
   control, only A. longifolia was present (see figure 2 and electronic
   supplementary material, S1).

(b) Grass presence

   To evaluate the probability of grass invasion into forest interiors, we
   developed logistic models of grass presence/absence as function of
   distance from edges and LAI. From these models, we learned that the
   probability of finding grasses in the forest in 2010 was higher close
   to edges (model I; figure 4a) and where LAI was low (figure 4b). For
   example, within 5 m of the forest edges of the burned plots the
   probability of finding grasses was 72–98%, whereas at 100 m this
   probability decreased to 11–26%; probabilities were much higher in
   burned plots than in the control plot (figure 4a). In general, the
   probability of finding grass in the control plot was 50 per cent or
   less (i.e. inflection point) at 8.0 m or more from the edge. In B1yr
   and B3yr, the analogous inflection points were 68.8 m or more and 51.6
   m or more, respectively (figure 4a).
   Figure 4.

   Figure 4. Probability of grass (native and exotic) (a) presence as
   function of distance from the edge and (b) LAI up to 100 m from the

   control. Solid lines, control; dashed lines, B3yr; dotted lines, B1yr.

   The probability of grass invasion decreased as a function of increasing
   LAI but at rates that differed among treatments. While the intercepts
   of our logistic model were similar between the burned plots and the
   control, the slopes were not (see figure 4b and electronic
   supplementary material, S3). As a result, the inflection points of this
   model differed among treatments, being higher in the control (3.0 m²
   m^−2), medium in B1yr (2.1 m² m^−2) and lowest in B3yr (1.6 m² m^−2).
   These results indicate that the differences in the probability of grass
   invasion between treatments were not fully explained by LAI, although
   our full logistic model explained 60 per cent of the variability in the
   data (pseudo r² = 0.60).

(c) Establishment of Brachiaria decumbens

   Based on the logistic models derived from model II, we found that the
   presence of B. decumbens was strongly influenced by LAI and seed
   additions (see figure 5 and electronic supplementary material, S5), but
   not by the fraction of mineral soil exposed or litter thickness (see
   the electronic supplementary material, S4). For example, where seeds of
   B. decumbens were sown, the probability of finding any grass 6 months
   later was 50 per cent or higher when LAI was less than or equal to
   2.45–3.14. In the control (without seed addition), the presence of B.
   decumbens was low for all levels of LAI (figure 5).
   Figure 5.

   two treatments with seed sowing and the control. Solid line, control;

   While B. decumbens occurred where canopy cover was sparse, it covered
   only small portions of the experimental plots. In the SEED treatment,
   for example, B. decumbens covered 1.0 ± 0.22% (s.e.) of the circular
   plots in 2010, although it increased to 10.0 ± 2.30% (s.e.) in 2012. In
   the BARE treatment, where the seeds were sown after the soil surface
   was raked, even 2 years after seeding the ground covered by B.
   decumbens was only 4.4 ± 1.14% (see the electronic supplementary
   material, S6). Because its ground cover was less than 10 per cent, the
   establishment of this grass is expected to have little current effect
   on fuel loads.

(d) Grass invasion and fire behaviour

   In August 2010, fine fuel loads along the forest edge were highest in
   areas dominated by exotic grasses (2.1 ± 2.2 kg m^−2 (s.d.)), medium in
   areas dominated by native grass (1.0 ± 0.34 kg m^−2 (s.d.)) and lowest
   in mixed vegetation types (0.8 ± 0.28 kg m^−2 (s.d.)). In the forest
   interior, fine fuel loads (comprising mostly leaves and small twigs)
   were lower (0.3 ± 0.13 kg m^−2 (s.d.); figure 6a).
   Figure 6.

   Figure 6. (a) Biomass, (b) moisture, (c) standing height, (d) flame
   height, (e) fire spread rate and (f) wind speed in areas with a
   predominance of A. gayanus (andropogon), A. longifolia (cuandu), mixed
   (environments dominated by lianas and woody sprouts) and forest fuels.

   Fire intensity (as measured during the fires of 2010) generally
   increased with fine fuel loads (figure 6d,e). Similarly, FSR were
   highest in andropogon (8.7 m^−1 min^−1; CI: 5.0–13.4), medium in cuandu
   (3.90 m^−1 min^−1; CI: 5.0–10.4) and mixed vegetation types along the
   forest edge (1.35 m^−1 min^−1; CI 0.0–2.4) and lowest in the forest
   interior (0.29 m^−1 min^−1; CI: 0.25–0.32; figure 6f). When we used
   flame height as a proxy for fire intensity, we observed the same
   pattern with one exception. Flame heights were higher than expected in
   the mixed vegetation type (figure 6d), which suggests that we did not
   adequately measure the fuel loads.

4. Discussion

(a) Fire-induced loss of canopy cover encourages grass invasion, where seed
is available

   Results from our large-scale manipulative experiment corroborate the
   hypothesis that by killing trees, understorey fires promote grass
   establishment in neotropical forests, with important effects on local
   fire regimes and the likelihood of ecosystem transition. As
   fire-induced tree mortality thinned the canopy [27,33] and allowed more
   radiation to reach the forest floor, grasses advanced rapidly from the
   forest edge, where seed availability was not a constraint for invasion.
   Because these grasses accumulated more fine fuel above-ground than the
   C[3] woody vegetation they replaced [34], fires were more intense where
   grasses were more abundant, especially along forest edges. This is one
   of the first studies in the Amazon that experimentally documents the
   frequently posited abrupt transition from tree to grass dominance, with
   evidence for a strong positive feedback between grass fuels and fire
   intensity [9].

   Whereas, canopy cover declined substantially across most of the burned
   plots [33], grasses mostly occurred less than 200 m from forest edges.
   This result points to dispersal limitations on the rate of grass
   invasion over the 8 years of the experiment. For exotic C[4] grasses,
   this spatial pattern was expected given that pastures bordered the
   experimental plots for more than 20 years. Apparently, while wind,
   animals, insects and human visitors dispersed some grass seeds into the
   forest interior [35], dispersal was limited. Also noteworthy is the
   presence of native cerrado species in the area although cerrado patches
   begin more than 50 km from the experimental forest [17].

   The spatial–temporal pattern of grass invasion was influenced not only
   by canopy density and seed availability, but also by the physiological
   characteristics of the grasses growing along the forest edge. Aristida
   longifolia was the only grass species to invade the control plot,
   probably because this a native C[3] species with lower light
   requirements than most C[4] pasture grasses [30,36]. This shade
   tolerance probably enables A. longifolia to invade forests even when
   canopy cover is relatively dense, which may explain why it was the most
   common invader of the experimental plots following the low-intensity
   fires of 2004. Once established, however, this grass species tended to
   accumulate enough above-ground fine fuel to promote higher intensity,
   tree-killing fires, which opened the canopy and facilitated the
   invasion of exotic, light-demanding C[4] pasture grasses. Because these
   C[4] grasses accumulated more fuel than A. longifolia or the native
   woody vegetation, fires became more intense over time along the forest
   edge (figure 6). This pattern was observed in B3yr, but not in B1yr,
   where A. longifolia remained the most dominant species over the
   duration of the experiment.

(b) Fire selects for native and exotic grasses

   Results from our seeding experiment with B. decumbens reinforce the
   notion that variables other than light availability (e.g. herbivory,
   pathogens and competition) constrain the establishment of exotic
   grasses in forest interiors [35,37]. For example, while we sowed seeds
   of B. decumbens in quantities considered high enough to overcome seed
   limitation (150 kg ha^−1) [38], this African pasture grass covered only
   a small fraction of the experimental subplots. Low light levels could
   explain this invasion failure, but LAI ranged widely across the
   experimental subplots and some areas were open (LAI < 0.5 m^2 m^−2).
   High seed predation could also explain the low capacity of B. decumbens
   to invade our fire-disturbed forest, but we found no effect of the BARE
   treatments in which seeds were buried to reduce predation and promote
   germination. Hence, it is still unclear why so few B. decumbens seeds
   germinated and why there was no substantial grass expansion across the
   heavily seeded subplots, but herbivory, pathogens and above- and
   below-ground competition probably contributed to this pattern [35,37].
   These findings notwithstanding, the 10-fold increase in grass expansion
   in the SEED treatment from 2010 to 2012 (see the electronic
   supplementary material, S6) suggests that populations of this grass
   species will expand further over time.

(c) Persistence of fire-promoting grasses

   While grass establishment transformed large portions of the forest
   edges into savannah-like ecosystems, it is still unclear whether this
   novel ecosystem will persist. Two years after the most recent fire,
   grasses still covered approximately 32–37% of the experimental forest
   edge, suggesting that this grassy ecosystem is at least semi-permanent.
   But over longer, fire-free time periods (e.g. decades), remnant tree
   growth and tree regeneration from resprouts and seedlings are expected
   to outcompete grasses. For instance, in eastern Amazonian moist
   forests, abandoned pastures give rise to secondary forests in 4–20
   fire-free years, depending on the pasture-use history [39,40].
   Similarly, Uhl et al. [41] found that a forest subjected to a
   slash-and-burn agriculture began shading grasses within a year of
   abandonment. Finally, Kauffman [42] found that in a burned and logged
   forest in Paragominas (Pará), 75 per cent of tree species had the
   capacity to resprout after fire in a logged forest and that the mean
   resprout height reached 4.2 m 20 months after the disturbance. Based on
   these studies and others [39,43], it seems likely that fire-disturbed
   forests can recover over years or decades even in the presence of
   grasses, at least if there is natural regeneration of woody plants and
   fires cease. In our study site, the grass invasion front retreated over
   time since fire in the burned plots, supporting this proposition.

   After episodes of intense and frequent fires that exceed forest
   resilience, recovery may require many fire-free decades. Given that
   fires are increasing in the study area, it seems more likely that many
   fire-disturbed forests will permanently transition into grassy
   ecosystems. Moreover, the greater species evenness at intermediate
   disturbances (burn every three years) perhaps suggests different fire
   frequencies will select for a suite of different grass species at
   degraded forest edges [1,5,21,44]. Repeated and severe fires not only
   alter forest structure and microclimate in ways that facilitate grass
   invasion and establishment, but also reduce the competitiveness of the
   native woody vegetation; fires (i) kill seed trees [19], (ii) increase
   seed predation of native tree species [45], (iii) lower seed
   germination [10,44,46] and (iv) reduce tree seedling density and
   diversity [46,47]. Despite these insights, the question of how much
   disturbance is too much to cause a change in the state of this system
   is still hard to answer. Empirical evidence suggests that instead of
   grass domination, fire-degraded forests may become dominated by vines,
   resprouts and pioneer tree species [15,23,41], while the presence of
   grasses is expected to be transient and strongly associated with high
   fire frequencies.

(d) Implications

   Major increases in grass invasion occurred following intense fires
   associated with drought events. This result suggests that fire could
   mediate the predicted climate-driven substitution of large portions of
   Amazonian forest by grass-dominated ecosystems. With the increases in
   air temperatures and decreases in precipitation predicted for the
   Amazon [4,48,49], fires are expected to become more frequent and
   intense [5,21,23,44], killing proportionally more trees. Although seed
   dispersal may limit invasion into fire-disturbed forests, seeds of
   exotic grasses are already abundant [5,17], particularly in the Xingu
   Basin where pastures cover much of the landscape [17]. While seeds of
   exotic C[4] grasses are abundant only along forest edges, approximately
   16 per cent of Xingu Basin forests are less than 200 from a
   forest-pasture edge [33].

   Although understorey fires and grass invasion can tip the balance
   between grass and tree domination, this process is not well represented
   in most dynamic vegetation models. In general, these models assume that
   there is no seed limitation on grass establishment [50]. For those
   models that do represent fire disturbance, fire behaviour is not
   differentiated between forests and grass-dominated environments. Our
   results show the need to incorporate fire in these models and to
   differentiate between forest understorey fires with and without the
   presence of C[4] African grasses.

Abstract

   Food waste in the global food supply chain is reviewed in relation to
   the prospects for feeding a population of nine billion by 2050.
   Different definitions of food waste with respect to the complexities of
   food supply chains (FSCs)are discussed. An international literature
   review found a dearth of data on food waste and estimates varied
   widely; those for post-harvest losses of grain in developing countries
   might be overestimated. As much of the post-harvest loss data for
   developing countries was collected over 30 years ago, current global
   losses cannot be quantified. A significant gap exists in the
   understanding of the food waste implications of the rapid development
   of ‘BRIC’ economies. The limited data suggest that losses are much
   higher at the immediate post-harvest stages in developing countries and
   higher for perishable foods across industrialized and developing
   economies alike. For affluent economies, post-consumer food waste
   accounts for the greatest overall losses. To supplement the fragmentary
   picture and to gain a forward view, interviews were conducted with
   international FSC experts. The analyses highlighted the scale of the
   problem, the scope for improved system efficiencies and the challenges
   of affecting behavioural change to reduce post-consumer waste in
   affluent populations.

1. Introduction

   Attempts have been made to quantify global food waste over several
   decades, motivated partly by the need to highlight the scale of ‘waste’
   in relation to global malnutrition. Such assessments are reliant on
   limited datasets collected across the food supply chain (FSC) at
   different times and extrapolated to the larger picture. The most often
   quoted estimate is that ‘as much as half of all food grown is lost or
   wasted before and after it reaches the consumer’ (Lundqvist et al.
   2008). Such estimates are difficult to scrutinize but highlight the
   need for greater resource efficiencies in the global FSC. This paper
   presents results from a driver review of food waste issues, combining
   information on food waste from the international literature and
   interviews with supply chain experts.

(a) Definitions

   Although waste is formally defined in different legal jurisdictions,
   definitions relate to particular points of arising and are often framed
   in relation to specific environmental controls. Food waste occurs at
   different points in the FSC, although it is most readily defined at the
   retail and consumer stages, where outputs of the agricultural system
   are self-evidently ‘food’ for human consumption. Unlike most other
   commodity flows, food is biological material subject to degradation,
   and different food stuffs have different nutritional values. There are
   also moral and economic dimensions: the extent to which available food
   crops are used to meet global human needs directly, or diverted into
   feeding livestock, other ‘by-products’ and biofuels or biomaterials
   production. Below are three definitions referred to herein:
    1. Wholesome edible material intended for human consumption, arising
       at any point in the FSC that is instead discarded, lost, degraded
       or consumed by pests (FAO 1981).
    2. As (1), but including edible material that is intentionally fed to
       animals or is a by-product of food processing diverted away from
       the human food (Stuart 2009).
    3. As definitions (1) and (2) but including over-nutrition—the gap
       between the energy value of consumed food per capita and the energy
       value of food needed per capita (Smil 2004a).

   The first two definitions are considered to be most relevant, although
   the second can only be supported if data are available that include
   nutritional assessment of animal feed and food processing by-products.
   Table 1 summarizes generalized stages in FSCs and illustrates different
   forms that ‘food waste’ may take.

   dates
   (11) end of life—disposal of food waste/loss at different stages of
   supply chain food waste discarded may be separately treated, fed to
   livestock/poultry, mixed with other wastes and landfilled

   Within the literature, food waste post-harvest is likely to be referred
   to as ‘food losses’ and ‘spoilage’. Food loss refers to the decrease in
   food quantity or quality, which makes it unfit for human consumption
   (Grolleaud 2002). At later stages of the FSC, the term food waste is
   applied and generally relates to behavioural issues. Food
   losses/spoilage, conversely, relate to systems that require investment
   in infrastructure. In this report, we refer to both food losses and
   food waste as food waste.

   Similarly, both ‘FSC’ and ‘post-harvest systems’ are used to mean the
   same thing in the literature, with ‘post-harvest loss’ also often used
   when describing agricultural systems and the onward supply of produce
   to markets. FSC is more associated with industrialized countries where
   post-harvest processing and large retail sectors are important
   features. ‘Post-consumer losses’ include food wasted from activities
   and operations at the point at which food is consumed. The method of
   measuring the quantity of food post-harvest is usually by weight,
   although other units of measure include calorific value, quantification
   of greenhouse gas impacts and lost inputs (e.g. nutrients and water).
   Where loss data are available for each step of a crop and are applied
   to production estimates, a cumulative weight loss can be calculated.

2. Food waste in the supply chain

(a) Introduction

   When the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   was established in 1945, it had reduction of food losses within its
   mandate. By 1974, the first World Food Conference identified reduction
   of post-harvest losses as part of the solution in addressing world
   hunger. At this time, an overall estimate for post-harvest losses of 15
   per cent had been suggested, and it was resolved to bring about a 50
   per cent reduction by 1985. Consequently, the FAO established the
   Special Action Programme for the Prevention of Food Losses.

   The main focus was initially on reducing losses of durable grain; by
   the early 1990s, the scope of work had been broadened to cover roots
   and tubers, and fresh fruits and vegetables (FFVs). Poor adoption rates
   for interventions led to the recognition that a purely technical focus
   was inadequate for solving problems within the sector and a more
   holistic approach was developed (Grolleaud 2002). There is no account
   of progress towards the 1985 post-harvest loss reduction target, and
   recently Lundqvist et al. (2008) called for action to reduce food waste
   advocating a 50 per cent reduction in post-harvest losses to be
   achieved by 2025.

(b) Global trends that influence supply chain losses

   Post-harvest losses are partly a function of the technology available
   in a country, as well as the extent to which markets have developed for
   agricultural produce. Three inter-related global drivers provide an
   overall structure for characterizing supply chains and future trends in
   developing and transitional countries.

   — Urbanization and the contraction of the agricultural sector. The
   proportion of the world's population employed in agriculture has
   declined in recent decades and 50 per cent of the world's population
   now lives in urban environments. This proportion is expected to rise to
   70 per cent by 2050 (United Nations 2008). Rapid urbanization has
   created the need for extended FSCs to feed urban populations. For these
   to be efficient, countries need improvements in roads, transportation
   and marketing infrastructure to keep food affordable for lower income
   groups. How these extended supply chains develop has implications for
   food waste globally, now and in the future.

   — Dietary transition. Growth of household incomes, particularly in BRIC
   countries, is associated with a decline in consumption of starchy food
   staples and diversification of diet into FFVs, dairy, meat and fish.
   This transition conforms to Bennett's Law (Bennett 1941), where the
   food share of starchy staples declines as income increases. The shift
   towards vulnerable, shorter shelf-life items is associated with greater
   food waste and a greater draw on land and other resources (Lundqvist et
   al. 2008). The transition varies by country and culture, e.g. in India,
   there is less pressure on resources compared with China, where the
   demand for meat is increasing rapidly.

   — Increased globalization of trade. International trade in processed
   foods accounts for 10 per cent of total processed food sold (United
   Nations 2002). Globalization may open up opportunities for agricultural
   exports while representing a threat to development of internal markets
   through competition from inexpensive imports of higher quality than can
   be produced locally. Linked to trade liberalization, multi-national
   chains have become a driving force in the rapid growth of supermarkets
   in many transitional economies.
   Industrialized countries are experiencing other drivers, the most
   significant being the ageing population profile and growth in single
   person households.

   To reflect these important global drivers, post-harvest losses are
   considered along a technological/economic gradient: ‘developing’,
   ‘intermediate’ and ‘industrialized’ FSCs. Figure 1 provides an overview
   of the development of post-harvest infrastructure along this gradient,
   expanded in table 2.

   and supply chain; more seasonal produce imported; more secondary
   processing of food medium- and large-scale farmers meet the quality and
   safety, as well as volume and timeliness demands of local (particularly
   supermarkets/convenience store chains) and export markets

   Developing countries: The majority of the rural poor rely on short FSCs
   with limited post-harvest infrastructure and technologies. More
   extended FSCs feeding urban populations are likely to involve many
   intermediaries between growers and consumers, which may limit the
   potential for growers to receive higher prices for quality. Farming is
   mostly small scale with varying degrees of involvement in local markets
   and a rapidly diminishing proportion of subsistence farmers who neither
   buy nor sell food staples (Jayne et al. 2006). Interventions within
   these systems focus on training and upgrading technical capacity to
   reduce losses, increase efficiency and reduce labour intensity of the
   technologies employed. However, attempts to reduce post-harvest losses
   must take account of cultural implications. In years with food
   surpluses, the prices received for goods will be low. One option is to
   store surplus for lean years, but there may not be suitable storage
   facilities. To rectify this, investment and engineering skills are
   needed. There are many instances of relatively simple technologies
   providing effective solutions, such as an FAO project in Afghanistan
   and elsewhere that provided simple effective sealed storage drums for
   grain farmers, dramatically reducing post-harvest food losses (FAO
   2008).

   Transitional and industrialized post-harvest systems have a closer
   integration of producers, suppliers, processors, distribution systems
   and markets ensuring greater economies of scale, competitiveness and
   efficiency in the FSC. Supermarkets are the dominant intermediary
   between farmers and consumers. Even in poorer transitional economies,
   supermarkets are the main vehicle for delivering diversified diets: for
   the growing middle classes and the urban poor. This is almost entirely
   dependent on foreign direct investment, with high growth rates in
   Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America (Reardon et al. 2007).

   The sequence of transformation follows a different route in each
   country, particularly in the extent to which retailers bypass existing
   markets and traditional wholesalers to secure produce of the required
   standard and volume. There are often strong cross-links with export
   quality assurance, the quality standards set by supermarkets, and the
   procurement systems. Many of the issues identified are no different
   from supply chain issues in developed economies:

   — payment terms discouraging small growers;

   — retailer product quality standards deterring smallholders from
   supplying produce to the market;

   — high contractual penalties for partial or total non-delivery of
   orders by suppliers;

   — product take-back clauses in supplier contracts allowing retailers to
   return product to suppliers once a residual shelf-life has been
   reached;

   — often poor demand forecasting and replenishment systems and a lack of
   FSC transparency; and

   — difficulties inherent in transitioning from trading systems
   previously driven by spot market prices towards long-term contracts.
   Literature on transitional economies lacks analysis of the relative
   resource efficiency of alternative models of retail development,
   although there are lessons that might be learnt from industrialized
   countries. For instance, in the UK (DEFRA 2007), estimated contractual
   penalties, product take-back clauses and poor demand forecasting had a
   combined influence that drove 10 per cent over-production and high
   levels of wastage in the UK FSC.

   Accounts of supermarket expansion in some countries suggest there are
   instances of successful adaptation to traditional supply chains (Chen
   et al. 2005), particularly in regions that have not been so involved in
   export-orientated markets. Where central wholesale markets are used to
   source fresh produce, retailers may be reliant on wholesalers to
   perform the ‘out-grading’ that in developed countries is likely to
   occur on-farm or at front-end packing operations. In countries with
   traditional two-tier produce markets (higher quality export and lower
   quality domestic markets), local supermarkets have created a third
   market for intermediate to high-quality products. At the same time,
   retailers provide upward pressure to improve product quality and food
   safety in the domestic market.

   Growth in FFV production has been particularly strong in the
   Asia-Pacific region (Rolle 2006), although the replacement of
   traditional markets with supermarkets has been slower in the fresh
   produce sector, compared with other food sectors. Within the region,
   FFV producers can be grouped into small farmers, groups of farmers,
   cooperatives, commercial farmers and foreign entities/multinationals.
   These producers target different markets, and show a gradient in their
   production capabilities, access to technologies, markets information
   and infrastructure. Production is dominated by small farmers with
   limited access to resources and technology. Growers generally focus on
   production activities, showing little interest in post-harvest and
   marketing, which are primarily undertaken by middlemen and traders.
   Their major markets include highly disorganized traditional wholesale
   and wet markets, though many supply the requirements of institutions,
   supermarkets and fast food chains. With limited access to financial
   resources and low returns from agricultural production, these farmers
   do not invest in new technologies or improve yields through increasing
   inputs to production (Mittal 2007).

   Development of more industrialized FSCs can also result in growth in
   the food processing sector. In some BRIC countries, public sector
   investment is being considered to accelerate this process. In India,
   the government is discussing an ‘evergreen revolution’, which will
   involve the build-up of food processing units. While this is a
   sensitive issue because of concerns about the industrialized sector
   taking control over small farmers, the improved infrastructure has
   helped farmers branch out into new foods, diversifying their incomes.

   Industrialized FSCs: medium-high income countries often argue that
   better resource efficiency and less waste are achieved through
   centrally processing food. Although more food wastage occurs at the
   factory, logic suggests less waste overall is generated as there is
   less ‘scratch-cooking’ at home. However, research on post-consumer food
   waste suggests that this is not the case, as consumers still waste
   significant quantities of food, thus potentially negating the benefits
   of centralized food processing.

(c) Estimates of FSC losses

(i) Introduction

   The distinction between perishable and non-perishable food stuffs is an
   important consideration in post-harvest losses and the adequacy of FSC
   infrastructure (table 3). The following sections review post-harvest
   losses for cereals (non-perishables) and FFVs (perishables); few
   sources were found for other food types.

   properties and storage regimes. From FAO (1981).

   and several months
   losses during storage mainly from exogenous factors (moisture, insects
   or rodents) losses owing partly to endogenous (respiration,
   transpiration, germination) and to exogenous factors (rot, insects)

(ii) Post-harvest loss estimates for non-perishable food crops

   Losses in industrialized countries are not included as loss rates are
   generally considered to be low (e.g. barley losses can be as low as
   0.07–2.81%; Smil 2004a) and are not considered significant under normal
   circumstances.

   Grain losses occur in post-harvest systems owing to physical losses
   (spillage, consumed by pests) or loss in quality. Few datasets were
   found relating to loss of grain quality, owing to difficulty in
   measurement. As most of the global production of maize, wheat, rice,
   sorghum and millet must be held in storage for periods from one month
   to more than a year, many studies focus largely on storage losses.

   Data available for rice post-harvest losses, based on field surveys and
   used here as an example, are quite extensive (table 4) and represent
   the ‘best case’ compared with data for other crops. More extensive
   studies suggest that about 15 per cent of grain may be lost in the
   post-harvest system (Liang et al. 1993), with higher storage losses
   associated with the 80 per cent of China's grain stored by peasants
   inside their houses or in poorly constructed granaries. The extent to
   which variations in data presented in table 4 might relate to different
   levels of post-harvest technology is unclear. For instance, data
   discussed by Grolleaud's review (2002) found the heaviest losses at the
   milling stage, perhaps attributable to case studies from more
   mechanized systems than Liang's data, where storage losses were
   predominant. This emphasizes the need for post-harvest loss data to be
   regularly updated and more fully described, particularly for
   transitioning economies.

   main stages of loss Grolleaud (2002)
    China 5–23 excludes processing losses Yong et al. (1997)

   Climatic conditions are also an important consideration in determining
   the wider applicability of data. In humid climates, rice losses are
   generally greater at the drying stage (Grolleaud 2002). Hodges
   (undated) reviewed grain losses in East and South Africa, attempting to
   compare loss rates in hot humid climates (where open storage structures
   were required to maintain airflow) and hot dry climates (favouring
   sealed storage designs). Hodges concluded that data on storage losses
   were too limited to permit reliable comparisons of loss rates under
   different climates. In common with other authors, Tyler (1982)
   suggested that the aggregated data reflecting losses on a worldwide
   basis are of little value. Long-term studies of post-harvest losses in
   Zambia and India were identified as using ‘reliable methodology’ and
   indicative of the fact that when post-harvest losses are determined by
   field survey, storage and related post-harvest losses are usually lower
   than previously reported (table 5; Tyler 1982).

   1.8 up to 9 insects maize Malawi
   1.7 up to 9 insects sorghum Malawi
   5.5 6 insects, rodents and moulds maize Nepal

   In summary, the main factors contributing to overestimation of grain
   losses were: (i) where extremes are taken rather than averages: ideally
   sample size and standard deviation should be quoted with the loss
   estimate to avoid this; (ii) removal from store over the season are not
   always accounted for and where they do occur, percentage losses
   calculated on the basis of grain remaining in store will be
   overestimates unless an inventory is kept; (iii) treating partial
   damage as a total loss, when the damaged grain would be used by farmers
   for home consumption or animal feed; and (iv) potential for
   double-counting losses at different stages in the post-harvest system.

(iii) Post-harvest losses for perishable crops

   The causes and rates of post-harvest losses for perishable crops are
   substantially different from those for grains. Horticultural products
   generally suffer higher loss rates within industrialized and developing
   countries, although at different points in the FSC and for different
   reasons. Table 6 summarizes post-harvest loss estimates for FFVs for
   both developing and industrialized FSCs.

   loss estimates: US and UK
   USA all FFVs 2–23, farm-retail stage Kader (2005)
   UK all FFVs approx. 10, farm-retail stage Garnett (2006)
   ‘out-graded’ FFVs 25–40, rejected by supermarkets Stuart (2009)

   Kader (2005) estimated that approximately one-third of all FFVs
   produced worldwide is lost before it reaches consumers. Losses in the
   USA are estimated from 2 to 23 per cent, depending on the commodity,
   with an overall average of 12 per cent. A tentative estimate from the
   UK suggests losses of 9 per cent (Garnett 2006), but this disregards
   produce that might be left in the field after failing to meet cosmetic
   or quality criteria. Although not necessarily a post-harvest loss,
   out-grading represents a significant aspect of waste that is difficult
   to quantify and largely anecdotal (Stuart 2009), with some produce
   likely to enter the food processing sector if it does not meet the
   criteria. In the EU, quality and size classifications for marketing
   FFVs have excluded non-conforming produce from the market. Recent moves
   have relaxed these rules to allow the sale of such FFVs where they are
   labelled appropriately (EC 2008).

   The general difference between developed and developing countries is
   that FFV infrastructure losses are greater in developing than in
   developed countries. As with grain, more data on post-harvest losses
   are required to better understand the current situation, and
   uncertainties around how post-harvest loss data are extrapolated are
   broadly similar.

   As with grain, there is evidence of overestimation of perishable crop
   losses from traditional subsistence systems. Within such agriculture,
   the chain from field-to-consumer is usually short, both in time and
   distance. Traditional harvesting techniques, e.g. using sticks to
   harvest papaya and mango, may bruise fruit, with loss implications for
   more extended supply chains. However, a high proportion of FFVs are
   consumed because every quality finds a ready consumer within the
   locality.

   Where FFVs are marketed, there is potential for FSCs to be ill-adapted
   to the changing circumstances. Post-harvest loss literature cites
   measures to reduce these losses, including gentler handling of produce,
   better conditioning, faster transportation and proper storage (FAO
   1981; Rolle 2006). These measures require improved infrastructure and a
   heightened interest in quality of produce by the grower. Choudhury
   (2006) highlights high loss rates associated with a lack of packing
   houses in India, with FFVs generally packed in the field and some even
   transported without transit packaging. Furthermore, 30 per cent of FFV
   production in India is wasted through lack of a cold chain (Mittal
   2007). Government-supported cold chain programmes are operational in
   countries such as Thailand and Taiwan. In lower income countries,
   low-cost energy-efficient cool storage systems have been developed and
   implemented in an effort to minimize FFV storage losses.

(d) Overview of food processing and retail losses: UK example

   This review of post-harvest losses has considered wastage rates from
   the perspective of different food types. For industrialized countries,
   where waste arising data are compiled, it is possible to quantify total
   food losses across different sectors of the FSC. Figure 2 provides this
   profile for the UK, with the post-consumer element included for
   comparison.
   Figure 2.

   Food and drink waste is estimated to be approximately 14 megatonnes
   (Mt) in the UK, of which 20 per cent is associated with food
   processing, distribution and retail. Household food waste makes the
   largest single contribution, but reliable estimates of other
   post-consumer wastes (hospitality, institutional sources) have yet to
   be published. The estimated total waste arisings from the food and
   drink manufacturing and processing sector is 5 Mt per annum, where
   approximately 2.6 Mt is estimated to be food waste; a further 2.2 Mt of
   by-products are diverted into animal feed (WRAP 2010). Waste production
   surveys have identified that a large proportion of these arisings
   originate from meat and poultry, FFVs and beverage sectors. These
   wastes largely consist of by-products and unsold prepared food
   products.

   As an indication of the overall resource efficiency of the sector, a
   mass balance estimated that nearly 56 Mt of ingredients are used
   annually to produce 59 Mt of food products (C-Tech 2004). More mass
   balances conducted at food and drink manufacturing sites suggested that
   around 16 per cent of raw materials were wasted (WRAP 2010).

   A small number of large retailers in the UK exercise market power over
   the 7000 suppliers within the sector. To avoid being ‘de-listed’, food
   manufacturers will often over-produce in case extra quantities are
   required at short notice. For manufacturers of supermarkets' own
   brands, packaged surplus production cannot be sold elsewhere and
   becomes waste; however, the sector is adept at reusing the majority of
   food waste generated (C-Tech 2004). More detailed supply chain mapping
   studies are under way to understand where the greatest opportunities
   for increased resource efficiency lie (WRAP 2010).

   At the retail and distribution stage, the most recent estimate suggests
   366 kt per annum (WRAP 2010). Amounts of waste produced by food
   retailers vary between outlet types. Small grocery stores produce
   proportionately more waste than large supermarkets, as the former tend
   to be used by consumers for top-up shopping, which makes demand
   unpredictable.

3. Post-consumer food waste

   This section summarizes knowledge of post-consumer food waste, focusing
   on household sources and quantities of food wasted. Data from a handful
   of OECD countries and economies in transition were reviewed. We were
   unable to find published studies relating to post-consumer food waste
   in the developing world, where a ‘buy today, eat today’ food culture
   exists.

(a) Types of study and data on post-consumer food waste

   Methodologies for post-consumer waste analysis vary, from small numbers
   of households weighing food waste or using kitchen diaries to waste
   compositional and behavioural studies involving thousands of households
   (WRAP 2008, 2009a). Others have used contemporary archaeological
   excavations of landfill sites to determine historical levels of food
   waste (Jones 2006); estimated household food waste indirectly from loss
   coefficients based upon existing research (Sibrián et al. 2006); or
   estimated wastage using statistical models relating population
   metabolism and body weight (Hall et al. 2009).

   Some studies have measured household food waste as a percentage of
   total consumed calories, others as a percentage of the total weight of
   consumed food or of the consumed food items. Some studies have sought
   to estimate the environmental impact of food waste, including the
   embodied greenhouse gas emissions (WRAP 2008, 2009a) or water
   (Lundqvist et al. 2008).

   Most of the estimates relying on exogenous food loss coefficients come
   from studies dating back to the 1970s. Since then, technological
   progress resulting in fast changes in markets, distribution systems and
   household storage facilities have rendered these estimates outdated
   (Kantor 1998; Naska et al. 2001). Increased consumer choice and a
   decrease in the proportion of disposable income spent on food have
   tended to increase wasteful behaviour. As such, any study where waste
   was measured over time as a constant proportion of food consumed is in
   danger of being inaccurate (Sibrián et al. 2006).

   In many studies, food scraps fed to domestic animals and sink disposals
   were not included, thus yielding inaccurate estimates for total food
   waste (Harrison et al. 1975; Wenlock & Buss 1977; T. Jones 2003,
   unpublished data). In some cases, the wastage owing to feeding to pets
   reached 30 per cent of the total food wastage in dietary energy terms
   (Mercado-Villavieja 1976; Wenlock et al. 1980; Osner 1982).

(b) Definition of household food waste

   Sources of food and drinks that are consumed within the home include
   retail and contributions from home-grown food and takeaways. Figure 3
   indicates which disposal routes are classified as household waste
   streams. In effect, this excludes significant quantities of food and
   drink eaten ‘on-the-go’, in the workplace or in catering
   establishments. Wherever possible, the distinction is made between
   three classifications of household food waste (figure 4): ‘avoidable’,
   ‘possibly avoidable’ and ‘unavoidable’.

(c) How much food is wasted in the home?

(i) UK studies

   Pre-Second World War studies (Cathcart & Murray 1939) showed that 1–3%
   of food was wasted in the home in Britain. The next major study, by the
   UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1976, investigated
   the 25 per cent ‘crude energy gap’ between estimates of embodied energy
   in domestically grown and imported food (an average of 12.3 MJ (2940
   kcal) of energy to each person per day), and the average physiological
   requirement for energy according to the UK Department of Health and
   Social Security (9.6–9.8 MJ (2300–2350 kcal)/person per day) (Wenlock
   et al. 1980; Osner 1982). The resultant survey of 672 households
   recorded all the potentially edible food wasted in a week, and found
   that, when assessed against the expected usage of food in the home,
   wastage accounted on average for 6.5 per cent of the energy intake in
   summer and 5.4 per cent in winter (Osner 1982).

   More recently, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has
   shown that household food waste has reached unprecedented levels in UK
   homes (WRAP 2008, 2009a,b), with 8.3 Mt of food and drink wasted each
   year (with a retail value of £12.2 billion, 2008 prices) and a carbon
   impact exceeding 20 Mt of CO[2] equivalent emissions. The amount of
   food wasted per year in UK households is 25 per cent of that purchased
   (by weight).

(ii) US studies

   A 1998 study by Kantor et al. of food waste in the USA revealed that 25
   per cent of food was wasted. Archaeological excavations of US landfills
   by the University of Arizona (Griffin et al. 2009) also drew attention
   to food waste in the USA and provided quantitative data on the likely
   scale.

   Jones et al. (T. Jones, A. Bockhorst, B. McKee & A. Ndiaye 2003,
   unpublished data) estimated that American households discarded 211 kg
   of food waste per year, not including food to drain, into home
   composting or feed to pets. The amount of food loss at the household
   level was estimated to be 14 per cent (T. Jones, A. Bockhorst, B. McKee
   & A. Ndiaye 2003, unpublished data), costing a family of four at least
   $589.76 annually (Jones 2004). Jones has estimated that overall food
   losses in the USA amount to US$90–100 billion a year, of which
   households threw away US$48.3 billion worth of food each year (Jones
   2006). Finally, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that
   food waste in 2008 accounted for 12.7 per cent (31.79 Mt) of municipal
   solid waste stream (USEPA 2009).

(iii) Miscellaneous studies from other countries

   Despite the dearth of food waste data in Australia, a submission to the
   Senate inquiry estimated that food waste comprises 15 per cent of the
   20 Mt of waste that goes to landfill each year (Morgan 2009).

   A South Korean study (Yoon & Lim 2005) followed their 2002 landfill ban
   on food waste in the municipal waste stream and suggested that food
   accounted for 26–27% of household waste (Baek 2009). Despite an
   awareness-raising effort in advance of the ban, food waste increased by
   almost 6 per cent over 4 years after the ban, with increased
   consumption of FFVs linked to higher incomes cited as a reason.

   The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality has
   estimated that Dutch consumers throw away approximately 8–11% of food
   purchased (2009), equating to 43–60 kg of food waste with an average
   value of €270–400 per person per year (Thönissen 2009).

   Finally, a UN FAO study (Pekcan et al. 2006) estimated household food
   wastage using a sample of 500 households in Ankara, Turkey, grouped
   according to socio-economic status. Mean energy intake levels per
   consumption unit and per person were 2692.6 and 2207.9 kcal d^–1,
   respectively. The mean daily energy loss from acquisition of food to
   plate waste was 481.7 kcal by the average household and 215.7 kcal per
   person, amounting to 8.9 per cent of daily per person dietary energy
   consumption. The average daily discards per household and per person
   were 816.4 and 318.8 g, respectively.

(iv) Comparison of food waste arisings between countries

   The few quantitative studies that relate to post-consumer food waste
   are difficult to compare in terms of food wastage per household, as
   demonstrated in table 7. Different methods and definitions applied to
   the measurement of food waste reduce comparability of data and some
   methods do not provide robust estimates owing to small samples.
   Different definitions of food waste are applied, particularly with
   regard to ‘edible’ and ‘inedible’ fractions and the extent to which
   alternative disposal routes are considered. When differences are
   identified, the post-consumer element must also be considered in the
   context of the whole FSC.

(d) What types of food are being wasted?

   Most studies that have sought to identify the main food types wasted
   find that it is the most perishable food items that account for the
   highest proportion of food waste. FFVs are usually among the
   most-wasted items, followed by other perishables like bakery and dairy
   products, meat and fish (Pekcan et al. 2006; WRAP 2008; Morgan 2009;
   Thönissen 2009).

   There is often a large variation in the wastage rates for different
   food types: WRAP (2009a) found that 7 per cent of milk purchases is
   wasted, 36 per cent of bakery and over 50 per cent of lettuce/leafy
   salads (by weight), while Jones et al. (T. Jones, A. Bockhorst, B.
   McKee & A. Ndiaye 2003, unpublished data) found similar variations in
   the average wastage rates for different food types.

   Although food and drink categories are not fully consistent across
   studies, figure 5 serves to highlight variation in household food waste
   composition. Thönissen (2009) found an unusually high proportion of
   food waste consisted of dairy products, while in the Turkish data,
   wasted FFVs accounted for the highest proportion (Pekcan et al. 2006).
   The extent to which such differences relate to consumption patterns or
   different wastage rates cannot be divined from these data alone,
   although the Turkish study noted the importance of fruit in the diets
   of households studied. Nor do these compositional data distinguish
   between avoidable and unavoidable food waste, the exception being the
   UK data shown in figure 6.

(e) Who is wasting all of this food?

   The following factors may help to explain variation in quantities of
   household food waste generated.

   — Household size and composition. Studies from the UK (Wenlock & Buss
   1977; Osner 1982; WRAP 2009a) and the USA (Van Garde & Woodburn 1987)
   show that food wastage was significantly influenced by the composition
   of the family, with adults wasting more in absolute terms than
   children, and larger households wasting less per person than smaller
   households. Single-person householders tend to throw away more per
   capita, and households with children tend to waste more than households
   without children, although rates vary with the children's age.

   — Household income. The majority of studies suggest that there is lower
   food loss in low-income than in high-income households (Osner 1982;
   Brook Lyndhurst 2007); some studies (Dowler 1977; Wenlock et al. 1980;
   T. Jones 2003, unpublished data) found little or no correlation between
   income and food wastage.

   — Household demographics. Studies in the UK (Osner 1982; Brook
   Lyndhurst 2007) and Australia (Hamilton et al. 2005) suggest that young
   people waste more than older people, with pensioner households wasting
   the least (such households normally contain comparatively fewer
   people).

   — Household culture. There is some indication that culture partly
   determines food wastage. For example, Hispanic households in the USA
   have lower food loss rates (approx. 25% less) than non-Hispanics and
   Hispanic households consume more FFVs compared with non-Hispanic
   households. However, FFV consumption among Hispanic households has
   decreased over the last 20 years as they consume more prepared foods.
   Food waste studies in the UK (Brook Lyndhurst 2007) and Australia
   (Hamilton et al. 2005) have sought to profile segments of the
   population according to their attitudes and behaviours with respect to
   food, drawn from household survey work and waste compositional data.
   Such studies are a useful tool in targeting particular elements of the
   population with waste reduction messages and information.

(f) Why are we wasting all of this food?

   There are a limited number of studies focusing specifically on the
   reasons for householders wasting food, largely restricted to the UK
   (Exodus 2006; Brook Lyndhurst 2007; WRAP 2008, 2009a,b), the USA (Van
   Garde & Woodburn 1987) and Australia (Hamilton et al. 2005).

   These studies highlight a complex array of consumer attitudes, values
   and behaviours towards food and how varying degrees of food knowledge
   affect individual's propensity to waste food. It is possible to group
   identified attitudes, values and behaviours by using a combination of
   qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques thereby
   determining key claimed behaviours, and waste compositional analysis.
   The resultant information is then used to establish those attitudes,
   values and behaviours that are the strongest drivers of household food
   waste. In the UK, detailed research findings described in figure 7 for
   the two principal reasons why avoidable food waste occurs are: ‘food is
   not used in time’ and ‘too much food is cooked, prepared or served’.
   Figure 7.

   Figure 7. Classification of UK household food and drink waste by
   avoidability, reason for disposal and economic value. Bracketed figures

   Bracketed figures show the tonnages and economic values for food and
   drink separately.

   These two broad categories are explained below:

   — Cooked, prepared or served too much. In the majority of cases, this
   is because too much food was ‘processed’ in the home, but also covers
   cases where food was damaged during processing (e.g. burning food).
   This category could be referred to as ‘leftovers’.

   — Not used in time. This covers food and drink wasted because it passed
   a date label (e.g. a ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date), has gone mouldy
   or looked, smelt or tasted bad.
   From the research conducted in the UK (table 8), Australia and the USA,
   some conclusions can be drawn about the main factors that drive food
   waste in the home and practical solutions can be shaped that make it
   easy for consumers to reduce the amount of food they waste.

4. Food waste to 2050: projections and uncertainties

   Food wasted along the FSC is the outcome of many drivers: the market
   economy, resource limitations and climate, legislation and cultural
   differences being just a few. We have outlined the difficulties in
   defining and quantifying such waste and described how production of
   waste differs within the developing, transitional and developed worlds.
   Here we discuss the trends likely to drive waste production in future,
   where there could be the greatest potential for reduction of food waste
   to occur in developing and developed worlds, and what policies and
   systems may be required to reduce food waste to 2050.

(a) Future trends

   In the developing world, lack of infrastructure and associated
   technical and managerial skills in food production and post-harvest
   processing have been identified as key drivers in the creation of food
   waste, both now and over the near future (WFP 2009). This situation
   contrasts with that in developed countries where our interviewees
   forecast the majority of food waste continuing to be produced
   post-consumer, driven by the low price of food relative to disposable
   income, consumers' high expectations of food cosmetic standards and the
   increasing disconnection between consumers and how food is produced.
   Similarly, the increasing urbanization within transitioning countries
   will potentially disconnect those populations from how food is grown,
   which is likely to further increase food waste generation.

   Across the globe, resource and commodity limitations, in part as a
   result of an increasing population but also owing to impacts of climate
   change, were viewed as being likely to increase the economic value of
   food, potentially driving more efficient processes that could lead to
   food waste reduction. Industrialized FSCs will continue to develop in
   response to these wider challenges by the development of shared
   logistics (e.g. collaborative warehousing), identification and
   labelling of products (use of barcodes and RFID tags) and better demand
   forecasting (Global Commerce Initiative 2008), and domestic kitchen
   technologies (smart fridges, cookers, online meal planning and recipe
   resources) may make it easier for consumers to manage their food better
   and waste less of it.

(b) The greatest potential for food waste reduction

   Interviewees emphasized the importance of implementing sustainable
   solutions across the entire FSC to fully realize the potential for food
   waste reduction. In developing and emerging economies, this would
   require market-led large-scale investment in agricultural
   infrastructure, technological skills and knowledge, storage, transport
   and distribution. Such investments have been shown to stimulate rural
   economies (WFP 2009), e.g. the development of the Nile Perch Fishery in
   East Africa. In this case, and despite the unintended consequences of
   over-fishing and disruption of local communities, the international
   market for Nile perch stimulated infrastructure development and
   considerably reduced post-harvest losses.

   Where international markets and local policies and investment are
   lacking, large-scale capital investment in infrastructure in developing
   countries has often failed (FAO 2003; Kader 2005). For long-term
   sustainability, development across the FSC in the developing world
   requires locally supported government policies and investment alongside
   any market-led private investment with reach through into developed
   world markets. Examples of integrated cross-FSC approaches to food
   waste reduction include various cooperative schemes, e.g. the Common
   Code for Coffee Community, and the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative.

   Conversely, the greatest potential for the reduction of food waste in
   the developed world lies with retailers, food services and consumers.
   Cultural shifts in the ways consumers value food, stimulated via
   education, increased awareness of the FSC and food waste's impact on
   the environment have the potential to reduce waste production. Improved
   food labelling and better consumer understanding of labelling and food
   storage also have food waste reduction potential. WRAP's ongoing
   activities in this area, through programmes such as ‘Love Food Hate
   Waste’, are very recent and their impact is yet to be established. With
   food price recognized as the most important factor in determining
   consumer decisions, anecdotal evidence suggests that the economic
   crisis has stimulated a shift in consumer attitude to food waste.

   Innovative technology throughout the FSC, in both developed and
   developing worlds, particularly in packaging, contributes to improving
   shelf life for perishable foods and semi-prepared meals. Continued
   developments in packaging, e.g. utilizing nanotechnology and materials
   science, have the potential to further increase shelf life.

(c) Policy, systems and practices

   In the developing world, transfer of existing technologies and the
   spread of good practice, allied to market-led investment, have the
   greatest potential to reduce food waste across the FSC. It is of key
   importance, however, that practical developments address the problems
   of local farmers, using indigenous knowledge where that has been shown
   to be sustainable. Without participation of local farmers, such
   knowledge transfer is unlikely to succeed.

   While attempts to shift consumer behaviour may result in reduction in
   food waste in developed countries, changes in legislation and business
   behaviour towards more sustainable food production and consumption will
   be necessary to reduce waste from its current high levels. An example
   might be through the development of closed-loop supply chain models
   (WEF 2010). In such models, waste of all forms would be fed back into
   the value chain (such as packaging waste being re-used), food graded as
   lower quality for cosmetic reasons and food that is surplus to retailer
   or manufacturers, to be made available through alternative routes (e.g.
   Fareshare or as cheaper alternatives), while unavoidable food waste
   would be utilized as a by-product, e.g. in providing energy from waste
   using the appropriate technology.

5. Conclusions

   A firm evidence base from which to assess food waste globally is
   lacking, with no specific information on the impact of food waste in
   BRIC countries a major concern, and with much of the loss estimates
   from developing countries collected over 30 years ago. There is a
   pressing need for quantitative evidence covering developing countries
   and the rapidly evolving BRIC country FSCs. Without systematic
   evidence, the arguments over the potential for reducing global food
   waste as a contribution to feeding nine billion people by 2050 will
   remain largely rhetorical, and measuring progress against any global
   reduction target impossible.

   As a consequence of the information gaps and uncertainties, there is no
   consensus on the proportion of global food production that is currently
   lost. Ranges between 10 and 40 percent of total global food production
   and as high as 50 per cent are quoted, but on closer examination, these
   estimates all link back to the same limited primary datasets, where
   much of the published data relates to fieldwork undertaken in the 1970s
   and 1980s. Recent reviewers of these data claim there is a tendency to
   over-state losses in relation to traditional agricultural systems in
   developing countries, a point reiterated in this review.

   The lack of infrastructure in many developing countries and poor
   harvesting/growing techniques are likely to remain major elements in
   the generation of food waste. Less than 5 per cent of the funding for
   agricultural research is allocated to post-harvest systems (Kader
   2003), and yet reduction of these losses is recognized as an important
   component of improved food security (Nellemann et al. 2009).
   Irrespective of global region, there is a need for successful
   introduction of culture-specific innovations and technologies across
   the FSC to reduce losses.

   Linked to the above, market transformation has enormous potential to
   develop FSC infrastructure and reduce waste in developing and BRIC
   countries. Account should be taken of the impact of market
   transformation on the local communities to whom food may no longer be
   available.

   The rapid expansion of FFVs supplied to consumers in transitional
   countries is highly likely to have resulted in significant post-harvest
   losses, owing to inadequate infrastructure. In the industrialized world
   meanwhile, post-harvest losses have been squeezed out of grain supply
   through heavy technological investments, while for FFVs, retailers' and
   consumers' demand for ‘cosmetically perfect’ produce has created
   significant post-harvest losses through ‘out-grades’. There is also
   strong evidence of an increase in post-consumer waste over the past
   several decades, particularly in the developed world, with pockets of
   data supporting similar behaviour in BRIC countries.

   The majority of studies show that as the proportion of income spent on
   food declines, food waste increases. There is clear evidence of a
   distribution of waste across demographic groups, with the lowest
   wastage rates in the immediate post-war age generation. However, it
   would be a mistake to assume that the demographic distribution will
   remain the same in the future, as today's elderly generally exhibit a
   ‘waste not want not’ mentality, while the elderly of the future are
   likely to continue to retain the same attitudes and behaviours to food
   that they have today.

   There are clearly fundamental factors affecting post-consumer food
   waste worldwide, some of which may require solutions that involve
   direct communication and awareness-raising among consumers of the
   importance of reducing food waste. Others require government
   interventions and the support and cooperation of the food industry
   itself, such as improving the clarity of food date labelling and advice
   on food storage, or ensuring that an appropriate range of pack or
   portion sizes is available that meets the needs of different
   households.
