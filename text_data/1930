   Your privacy is important to us. Much of the specific information
   requested within our site is voluntary and need not be submitted by the
   visitor. If personal information is submitted as part of a request for
   information, it is used to investigate or respond to the request. We
   may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is
   in a better position to meet your request. We do not release or sell
   information for the purpose of a third party's marketing program or
   solicitations.

   Types of information collected on Colorado.com
   We collect personal data when you order our guides or sign up for our
   newsletter, which includes first and last name, email address and
   mailing address.

   Navigation information
   Each time you visit Colorado.com, anonymous navigation information is
   collected by our servers. This information includes:
   • the type of browser and operating system you are using;
   • the address of the referring site (ie the previous site you had
   visited) and the website you leave our site to visit;
   • the date and time of your visit;
   • your server's IP address (a number which is unique to the machine);
   and
   • the address of the pages you accessed.

   This provides Colorado.com with information about how the website is
   used and navigated, including the number of hits, the frequency of
   visits and the duration of visits to each page on the site. It does not
   personally identify individual users.

   How we collect personal information offline
   Personal information will only be collected by lawful and fair means,
   for one or more specified purposes, which are relevant to
   Colorado.com's operations. When personal information is collected
   directly from the individual to whom it relates, the purpose of
   collection will be identified and it will only be collected with the
   person's consent.

   Information collected on this site may also be combined and
   de-identified to provide Colorado.com with anonymous demographic and
   usage information. Colorado.com can then use this aggregated
   information to develop new and/or more appropriate content to our
   users.

   In addition, anonymous navigation information may be used for
   statistical analysis of the site, for marketing purposes and to tailor
   the content of the site to the needs of Colorado.com users. Statistical
   information is not disclosed in connection with your personal
   information.

   Cookies
   Currently Colorado.com does use "cookie" technology. Cookies were
   originally designed to help a website distinguish a user's browser as a
   previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may
   have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie is a small
   string of text that a website can send to your browser. A cookie cannot
   retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses,
   or capture your email address.

   We use cookies so that we can provide personalized information that we
   believe will be of value to you based on preferences you have indicated
   while visiting the site. You will have the opportunity to decide
   whether or not to accept the cookie. You may opt-out of these features
   here.

   When we disclose personal information
   Colorado.com works with other companies that help us provide products
   and services to you and we may provide your personal information to
   these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this
   information so they can deliver your guide efficiently. In this case
   the information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes
   only, and we require that the companies we contract with safeguard your
   personal information in accordance with Colorado.com's policies.

   Personal information collected at this site will only be disclosed to
   third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with the terms
   and conditions of any relevant service. You should check the terms and
   conditions of individual products and services for information about
   disclosures.
