Twenty - Twenty

     [TPP-2020-Calendar.jpg]
   It is hard to believe it will be 2020 in just a few months. I
   remember when my oldest daughters soccer team was named
   the Y2K bugs because that was the year all the computers were
   going to crash and the internet was going to fall apart. Well
   that did not happen, thankfully and here we are 20 years later ready
   to ring in 2020 with That Patchwork Place's beautiful Quilt Calendar.
   [3-March-Sheryl-Johnson.jpg]
   I am so excited to have one of my Quirky Little Quilts featured
   in the calendar. I always wanted to be a calendar girl!
   The photos are lovely and each month comes with
   complete instructions for the featured project.
   If you would like to order a copy for yourself you can do so here.

A Favor

   [FrontCover_B1503_ReturningtoTemecula.jpg]
   [B1472_TQCQuirkyLittleQuilts_WEB.jpg]
   My new book Returning to Temecula was introduced 2 months
    ago and Quirky Little Quilts has been available for one year.
   I am so happy with the way they both turned out and I hope you are
   enjoying them as well. I have a little favor to ask, reviews on
   Amazon and Martingale are very helpful and if you would like
   to write a review you can do so using the following links.
   Returning to Temecula - Amazon | Martingale
   Quirky Little Quilts - Amazon | Martingale

   If you would like to purchase one or both books you can order
   them here. Order a copy of either book this week and we
     will include a little extra goodie to show our appreciation.

Mini Monday Giveaway Winner

   [IMG-0714.JPG]
   So sorry for the delay in announcing this months mini winner.
   For the last 10 days I have been road tripping to and from
   Idaho. We helped our youngest daughter, her husband
   and yes, my new grandson Cooper with their move.
   The winner of this months mini is Laurel Lee Pedersen.
   She thinks this little quilt is Cute, Cute, Cute!!!
   Laurel send me an email with your shipping information
   and I will get your mini on its way to you.
   P.S. If you loved this month mini you can
   download the free pattern for it here.
