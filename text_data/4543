ETHOS

   Our company believes in treating all people fairly. Our vision has
   taken us all over the world to source the best ingredients for our high
   quality spirits. We believe that all the people involved, in
   every stage of the process, should be treated equally.

CRAFT

   First we spend a great deal of time sourcing the finest Fairtrade
   ingredients for our spirits:
   Organic quinoa from the 3000 m high Altiplano plateau, organic sugar
   cane grown in the Belizean sun, organic arabica from Mexico, organic
   juniper berries from Uzbekistan, etc…
   Then we carefully ship everything to the famous region of Cognac in
   France, where the very best master distillers and brewers take over the
   production process. The heirs of a long line of distillers, they keep
   French expertise alive while further developing their techniques with a
   view to excellence.

WHAT IS FAIRTRADE ?

   The Fairtrade organization has rigorous standards for farming
   practices, which ensures our quinoa and other ingredients are all of an
   exceptional quality.

   FAIR. is the world’s first and unique Fairtrade certified spirits
   brand. We respect about 200 rules to make sure that we pay the farmers
   at a fair price. It enables them to cover their production costs, live
   from farming, educate their children and build schools.
   We’re happy, the farmers are happy, and we’re sure you’ll be happy with
   our spirits.

   Fairtrade is a global movement to alleviate poverty in ways that are
   economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.

Andean Mule for the holidays!

28 Dec Andean Mule for the holidays!

   Posted at 11:58h in Cocktails by FAIR. Content manager 0 Comments

   So, you might have noticed that it’s the holidays. But you probably
   don’t need us to point that out to you. You know because you’re
   exhausted from having to explain your job to your grandparents all week
   and type your parent’s obscure 16 character wifi password ten times
   until you finally get it right.

   And now it’s the weekend before New Year’s Eve and you’re realizing you
   have ten people descending on your house for pre-gaming before Vic’s
   house party in Bushwick. Not sure why you agreed to this? Neither are
   we tbh. But because we like to help rather than just sit here and enjoy
   your over-commitment, we’ve got a simple way to solve your problem.

   Grab ten of your best mason jars. Is that even a phrase? OK, the ten
   not chipped ones at least. Wash them (yes we have to say this. You
   never know).

   Squeeze half a lime into each glass.

   Add 1.7 fl. oz. (5cl.) of FAIR. Vodka, 5.1 fl. oz. (15 cl.) of ginger
   beer, and ice cubes into each glass as well.

   Stir!

   Garnish with a lime quarter or fresh rosemary, whichever takes your
   fancy.

   You now have yourself 10 Andean Mules. Simple to make but pretty to
   look at and delicious to drink. And an easy way to distract your guests
   for at least half an hour while you scramble to shower, or at least put
   deodorant on and get dressed.

   The best bit? You and your guests can feel good about drinking
   Fairtrade vodka this holiday season.

   Weekend saved! You’re welcome.
