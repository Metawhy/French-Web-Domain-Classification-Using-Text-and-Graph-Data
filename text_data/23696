       Serve with a fine Pinot Noir and share with the ones you love.

   PREPARATION:
   Dry brine the duck:
   Unwrap the duck, remove everything from the cavity, and pat dry with
   paper towels. Trim the neck skin just below the nub of the neck left on
   the duck. Poke the duck skin all over with a paring knife, so the fat
   can escape. Poke through the skin, but not into the meat – I poke with
   a very flat angle so I stay away from the meat. Sprinkle the duck with
   the salt and pepper, inside and out. Set in a baking dish, and put it
   in the bottom of the refrigerator, uncovered. Refrigerate at least
   overnight, preferably 24 to 48 hours.
   Set the grill up for indirect low heat:
   Set your grill up for indirect low heat, 250°F, with a drip pan on one
   side of the grill and the fire as far over on the other side as you can
   get it. In my kettle grill, I open the bottom vents a crack, with the
   blades of the ash sweeper covering ¾ of the rectangular holes. I make a
   tight pile of 80 unlit coals on 1/3 of the charcoal grate, about three
   coals deep. (3/4 of a charcoal chimney full.) Nestle the smoking wood
   in the coals. Next, I light 10 coals in my chimney starter; when the
   coals are lit and covered with gray ash, I pour them on top of the
   unlit coals. Then I set the drip pan on the other side of the charcoal
   grate, add my grill grate, and brush it clean. I put the lid on the
   grill immediately and set the top vent to half open.
   Grill smoke the duck:
   Put the duck on the grill grate over the drip pan, breast side up, and
   close the lid. Adjust the top vent to stabilize the temperature at
   roughly 250°F; let the temperature settle for fifteen minutes between
   vent adjustments. Once the temperature settles down, check the grill
   every hour and tweak the vent if necessary – a little more open for
   higher heat, a little more closed for lower heat. (The grill
   temperature is going to move around a lot; 250°F is my target, but I
   expect it to bounce around between 225°F and 300°F. And, keep the lid
   closed as much as possible – every time you lift the lid, heat will
   escape and the air you let in will cause the coals to heat up.) After
   an hour and a half, rotate the duck so the other side is facing the
   fire. The duck is done when it reaches a temperature of 175°F in the
   deepest part of the thigh, about 3 hours.
   Make the sauce:
   In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the wine,
   honey, and balsamic vinegar. Cut the peaches in halve and remove the
   cores. Place each peach face down over the direct heat on the grill.
   Turn them on both sides until they are golden, a little charred and
   soft. Remove from grill and set aside. Once cooled, dice a couple of
   the peaches and add to the pan.  Let the mixture simmer on low for 7
   minutes until it is a nice sauce consistency.
   Serve:
   Remove the duck to a platter and let it rest for ten minutes. Carve and
   add the grilled halved peaches and spoon the sauce over the entire
   masterpiece of yum!

Sexy Stuffed Beef Tenderloin in parchment

   Here is a beautiful recipe for the carnivorous carnal main course with
   the one you love.  This goes well with black satin lace and a fine
   Malbec.

                           [beeftenerloin-beefbacon.PNG]
                Beef bacon infuses this with a secret passion
                     you won't be able to live without.

   INGREDIENTS:
   For the stuffing
   8 slices of potato bread cut into ½ -inch cubes
   ½ cup dried wild mushrooms
   2 medium leeks, white and light-green parts only, halved lengthwise,
   thinly sliced, washed, and dried
   6 slices of beef bacon (it’s like the Prime Rib of Bacon)
   1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
   ¾ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
   1 Tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
   ¾ cup heavy cream
   3 large eggs
   For the beef
   3 lbs. trimmed whole beef tenderloin
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
   For the balsamic sauce
   ¾ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
   ¼ cup dry red wine
   ¼ finely chopped shallot
   1 dried bay leaf
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
   ½ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces
   Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
   DINNER FOREPLAY MUSIC SELECTION: D'angelo - How Does It Feel...taste?
   PREPARATION:
   Make the stuffing
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350°F. Arrange
   the bread in a single layer on one or two large rimmed baking sheets
   and toast until dried and crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool to room
   temperature on a rack.

   Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with 1/2 cup boiling water.
   Soak until softened, about 20 minutes. Strain the mushrooms over a
   bowl, squeezing them to extract more liquid. Reserve the liquid and
   mushrooms separately, and coarsely chop the mushrooms.

   Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about
   8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the
   leeks to the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the
   heat as necessary, until very soft, about 10 minutes.
   Coarsely chop the bacon and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the leeks,
   bread, mushrooms, cheese, parsley, thyme, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp.
   pepper. In a small bowl, whisk the cream, eggs, and the reserved
   mushroom soaking liquid, and pour over the bread mixture. Toss well,
   let sit for 5 minutes, and toss again. cover and chill for at least 30
   minutes and up to 1 day.
   Wrap the beef
   Pat the tenderloin dry and season well with salt and pepper. Lay some
   plastic wrap on a work surface so that it measures at least 20×20
   inches; overlap a couple of pieces of plastic wrap as needed. Put
   parchment paper at least the length of the tenderloin over the plastic
   wrap and spray it with cooking spray or lightly oil it. Press the
   stuffing mixture over the parchment into a rectangle measuring about
   12×14 inches.

   Position the beef in the center of the stuffing. Lift the plastic to
   wrap the parchment and stuffing around the beef, rolling it like a
   sushi roll and encasing the beef completely. Wrap tightly in the
   plastic wrap, twisting the excess plastic on each end to compress the
   roast. Tuck the twists under the roast to keep snug. Chill for at least
   1 hour and up to 1 day. Longer is better as it helps everything to firm
   up.
   Make the sauce
   Combine the vinegar, wine, shallot, bay leaf, and sugar in a small
   saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until reduced by nearly half, 10 to 12 minutes. Set
   aside. The sauce may be made up to this point 1 day ahead; cover and
   refrigerate.
   Roast the beef and finish the sauce
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375°F. Line a
   roasting pan with parchment and set a rack in it. Unwrap the plastic
   from the beef but leave the parchment on. Tie the roast with butcher’s
   twine in about 5 even intervals. Place the roast on the rack. Roast to
   medium rare (125°F), about 60 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes.

   Remove the bay leaf from the sauce and gently reheat the sauce over low
   heat. Swirl in the cold butter just until it melts to thicken the
   sauce. Remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

   Trim any uneven edges of the roast. Slice the roast through the
   parchment with a very sharp knife into thick slices, removing the twine
   as you go. The pieces may crumble a bit, so you may need to reassemble
   them on the serving plates or platter. Remove the parchment and serve
   with the sauce, garnished with the parsley.

COOKING WITH GOOD MUSIC MAKES FOR HAPPIER FOOD!

   Bad Girl BBQ isn't just a recipe book and it's not just about BBQ. It's
   a blog about whatever I'm cooking up and trying out on my brave
   friends.

   I find it impossible to cook without good music playing in the
   background, so I have selected great tunes to go with every recipe here
   on this blog. Try them out and see if you can taste the difference!

   My kind of "Bad" could be defined as someone who is not afraid to break
   the rules. I am not afraid to push the boundaries of what's possible
   and try new things. Many of these culinary experiments you will find on
   this blog, are the results of the creative adventurer in me.

   If you want to learn how good a bad girl can be in the kitchen and the
   process of grilling, smoking, home-brewing, home-made gifts, healthy
   and debaucherous culinary adventures, you have come to the right place.
   Roll up your sleeves, and let's get dirty!
