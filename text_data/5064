Help a Friend Out! Editable Word Work Menu

   I need a little help.
   I've had some requests to make some editable resources for some
   friends.
   I started with this Word Work menu (because who can't use Word Work
   ideas?).
   If you can, please download the freebie by clicking on the pic below.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-28%2Bat%2B3.42.58%2BPM.png]
   You'll get a PowerPoint file. If you are a Mac user (like me!), you can
   upload the file to Google docs or One Drive and edit it by adding your
   own vocabulary words.
   Once you try editing it, please leave me a comment below and let me
   know how it works.
   Be looking for more editable resources to come. I'm looking for a few
   Goggle Slides users to preview a few products for me. Send me your
   email if you'd like to help.

   third grade students and it hit home with both.

Have You Heard About Bouncy Bands?

   Teachers are always looking for A.N.Y.T.H.I.N.G. to help all kids, but
   especially for those who might need a little extra something something
   to help them focus. You've read my earlier post about flexible seating
   {click HERE if you missed it} and some ideas for implementation in your
   classroom.
   Here's another idea that I KNOW works.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-09-19%2Bat%2B4.18.49%2BPM.png]
   When I was a principal, several teachers provided Bouncy Bands for
   students who needed that extra little motion to keep them focused on
   their work.
   My daughter  is using them in her classroom this year. Although she
   thought she had pinpointed the students who would NEED to use them, she
   was surprised at the kids who ASKED to use them.
   One kiddo said he didn't see how that would help him focus, but he's a
   regular user now.
   [IMG_1606.JPG]
   [IMG_1604.jpg]
   For those times when they are working at their seats, just that little
   elastic band helps keep them focused and paying attention to their
   work.
   Bouncy Bands are easy to install and surprisingly quiet. There are two
   different types--one for desks and one for chairs. If you'd like to
   give them a try, visit the website by clicking HERE. See the research
   behind the bands, get info on how to apply for financial help through
   Donors Choose, and read testimonials from users. If you order by
   September 30, you can receive  TEN PERCENT OFF your order if you use
   the code POTPOURRI.
   It's worth the time checking the website out. Even if you don't need a
   classroom set, I really don't think you will regret ordering a few
   Bouncy Bands for those students you know need them. Don't be surprised,
   though, if you don't have to make a sign up sheet to rotate them
   through ALL your students, just like my daughter did.

Foul! Foul! Foul! Plural Nouns Freebie

   Bring out the competitive nature of your kiddos and throw in  just a
   little bit of chance with this freebie. Students draw a card, spell the
   plural form of the noun, and keep the card if they are correct. If they
   draw a FOUL card, they lose all their cards.
   This has always been a favorite in my classroom. Try it out with your
   kiddos and let me know what you think.
   Just click on the pic below to get the freebie.

Multiplication Gimme Game Freebie

   I believe that our kiddos MUST be fluent in multiplication and division
   facts, BUT I don't think every child will learn those facts through
   "drill and kill" rote memorization.
   Once you've given them manipulatives and let them build arrays to help
   them truly understand multiplication and division, I think games are a
   fun way to help them develop the necessary fluency they will need to
   work higher-level problems.
   This freebie is perfect for a fun way to develop fluency. Similar to Go
   Fish, your kiddos will try to be the first to get all four cards in
   a multiplication/division fact family.
   Just click on the pic below to get your copy!
   [Multiplication%2BFreebie%2Bat%2BPitner%2527s%2BPotpourri%2521.png]
   Show the love below with a comment! Let me know if there are any
   certain skills you'd like a freebie for.
