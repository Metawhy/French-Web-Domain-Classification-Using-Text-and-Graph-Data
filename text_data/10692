                               Hi, I'm Heidi.

        Bio Headshot | Heidi McBain, Texas Licensed Marriage & Family
    Therapist, Texas Licensed Professional Counselor, and Registered Play
                                  Therapist
     __________________________________________________________________

My private practice focuses solely on women. So, if you’re a woman, you are
in the right place!

Have you recently experienced a major life change?

   If so, you may be feeling many different emotions right now. Check out
   my Counseling for Women page for information about major life changes,
   and to learn more about depression, anxiety and grief.

Are you a mom currently trying to do it all?

   I bet you’re working (and yes, stay-at-home moms, I’m talking to you
   too!), running your household, and taking care of the needs of your
   husband and kids too. I understand the huge amount of stress you’re
   currently under, and I can help you make some shifts in your life so
   you can focus on what’s most important to you. Visit my Therapy for
   Moms page for more detailed information.

Have you recently experienced a loss in your life?

    Losses are so very hard, and may bring feelings of anger, sadness,
   fear or even numbness into your life as well. Please go to my page on
   Grief Support for Women to see if this type of therapy would be helpful
   to you.

How do I fit counseling into my busy life?

   Online Video Counseling may be just what you’re looking for! With this
   type of counseling, there’s no need to find a babysitter for your kids
   or a need to drive to your sessions. Your sessions can now conveniently
   take place in your home or office. I use a safe, secure and
   user-friendly platform called Doxy (which is similar to Skype). For
   more information, check out my Online Video Counseling page.

Have you thought about reaching out for a while?

   You know you need some extra help and support in your life right now,
   and you’re tired of navigating this stressful time all on your own.
   However, it’s hard to make that initial phone call or send that first
   email asking for help from a therapist. I get it. But, think about how
   different your life will be a month from now or six months from now or
   even a year from now, if you reach out and start this process today. I
   look forward to connecting with you soon to talk about how therapy can
   be helpful to you and the challenges you are currently experiencing
   within your own life.

About

About Therapy

   During your therapy sessions, you’ll have a supportive environment
   where you can feel comfortable sharing your personal story.

   It’s important that you feel heard, seen and understood during your
   sessions.

   Together, we will build on your individual strengths to create small
   steps you can take today to start feeling better.

   You should feel accepted right where you are in life, but also feel
   challenged to reach your desired goals for the future.

   Therapy sessions usually take place once a week. You’ll find change
   tends to occur faster with homework. These assignments may include
   self-care ideas, books/other reading material, podcasts or simply areas
   in your everyday life to think more deeply about over the course of
   your week.

   Please email me today to schedule your FREE 15-minute phone
   consultation. I look forward to hearing from you soon!

About Me

   Bio headshot for Heidi McBain, Women's Counselor & Online Video
   Therapist in Flower Mound, Texas 75022

   I’m often described as friendly, easy to talk to and empathic. I’ve
   worked with couples, families, children and teens in the past, but I
   now focus exclusively on women’s mental wellness. I’ve been married for
   17 years, and have two school-aged children and one Labrador retriever
   (who thinks he’s also a school-aged kid). I’m an endurance athlete and
   have completed multiple marathons and triathlons. I’ve lived in a few
   different states across the US, as well as overseas (and I speak some
   Spanish). I currently live in Flower Mound, Texas, outside of
   Dallas/Fort Worth.
