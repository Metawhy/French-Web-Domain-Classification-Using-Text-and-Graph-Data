What is DMARC?

   DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and
   Conformance. It’s like an identity check for your organization’s domain
   name. A DMARC policy allows a sender to indicate that their messages
   are protected, and tells a receiver what to do if one of the
   authentication methods passes or fails – either send the message or
   reject the message to junk. Further, DMARC helps prevent the sending of
   fraudulent email using your organization’s domain.

A DMARC Success Story!

   June 21, 2018

   DMARC holds a strong value to any entity that has an Internet presence,
   especially with email. This is because DMARC will prevent unauthorized
   usage of the organization’s email domain. It will also provide reports
   that will inform the organization as to what system (authorized and
   unauthorized) are sending using the organization’s email domain. It is
   important that DMARC be setup properly and with reporting enabled.

   One law enforcement agency (LEA) saw the benefit just a few months
   after implementation, especially being at policy level ‘reject’ – the
   highest level. Over 500 DMARC failure reports (RUF) were generated and
   emailed to their DMARC RUF mailbox within a 24-hour period. Based on
   these reports, an attacker was using one of their user’s email
   addresses – sending emails from Colorado, Quebec and other IP
   addresses.

   After further research and analysis by the LEA, it was determined that
   the spamming campaign was larger than initially determined. It was
   discovered that more than 43,000 “malicious” emails had been blocked
   due to the DMARC policy. The SPF domain used belonged to a parked
   domain created approximately 2 months prior. As the SPF and DKIM
   records didn’t match the email domain, the emails were blocked. The
   spamming campaign was further confirmed by a number of emails and phone
   calls from people saying they had received the email and/or assumed the
   LEA had been hacked.

   The LEA was able to work with DMARCian and with the mail service
   provider (from which the majority of the messages were originating
   from) to confirm that it was indeed fraudulent. The mail provider
   located the account and suspended it whilst their client investigated
   and resolved the issue with their mail systems.

   Even though the LEA is at DMARC policy level ‘reject’, many of the
   messages were able to get through due to lack of DMARC support at the
   recipient end. DMARC must have both the sender and recipient
   participate in order to be effective. The sender will create a DMARC
   policy, while the recipient enables DMARC verification. Had the
   receiving end done so, then all of these messages would have been
   blocked.

   This story just shows how important it is to implement DMARC, not only
   at the highest enforcement level, but to also have the reporting
   capability of DMARC enabled in the policy. Without the DMARC policy,
   the LEA would not have known about the campaign until citizens and
   partners reached out to them. This potentially could have hurt their
   reputation and trust within the community. Instead they were able to
   say they were aware and were in the process of handling it.
