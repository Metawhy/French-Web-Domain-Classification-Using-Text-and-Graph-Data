About

   I am Patrick Andraste.

   I live on Camano Island, WA and I like to take pictures of people and
   things. I have garnered a reputation for controversial and risque
   photography work. I have been taking pictures in earnest for about
   twelve years now. I have been published in magazines, I have been shown
   in galleries and my work appears on many websites.

   I take pictures that hopefully make you think, or at the least go what
   in the world are they doing…

   I used to be a performer and model for fetish and bdsm pictures and
   video.

   Anymore though, I am just trying to be just another guy living in the
   suburbs, two very smart kids, two cats, five turtles, three cars and
   all that goes with trying to live the american dream.
   I used to have a day job is as an engineer for a very large
   corporation. I sat in a cubicle all day in a skyscraper downtown and
   try to figure out how to make things work and how much it will cost.
   then I go home and wash the dishes and the laundry, feed the cats and
   the turtles and try to get the kids to do their homework and help
   around the house.
   This is probably not the glamorous life you envisioned for me.

   Now I am trying to sort through life and figure out what I want to do
   next. People keep prompting me to go full pro photographer. Funny thing
   is that I never thought of myself as a very good photographer.

   I can easily travel around the northwest. Outside of the Northwest I am
   available with travel and expenses paid. I travel often to central
   California and the San Francisco area and to Portland Oregon.

   If you have a project you would like me to work with you on feel free
   to contact me.

   I have an eclectic selection of cameras to work with from medium format
   to digital to underwater. Depending on the shoot and the project, I can
   shoot film or digital.

Playing with my RZ67

   An older shoot with Kristy. I have always enjoyed shooting with Kristy
   and she is highly recommended and very professional. Shot on film with
   my Mamiya RZ-67 I like shooting on film although it has gotten quite
   expensive. I have crates of film although in the move I seem to have
   misplaces my Polaroid film …

Playing with my RZ67

   An older shoot with Kristy.
   I have always enjoyed shooting with Kristy and she is highly
   recommended and very professional.
   Shot on film with my Mamiya RZ-67
   I like shooting on film although it has gotten quite expensive.
   I have crates of film although in the move I seem to have misplaces my
   Polaroid film collection.
