Cookies policy

What are cookies?

   Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by
   websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites
   work, or work better, as well as to provide information to the owners
   of the site. A cookie often contains a unique number, which can be used
   to recognise your computer when a user of your computer returns to a
   website that it visited previously.

How does Cancer Research UK use cookies?

   We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors, to
   better understand how our websites are used and to monitor how our
   advertisements perform. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you
   have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor.

Your rights

   Our cookies do not store financial information or information which is
   capable of directly identifying you (such as your name or address). You
   have the right to choose whether to accept these cookies. You can
   exercise this right by amending or setting the controls on your browser
   to reflect your cookie preferences. However, please note that if you
   choose to refuse cookies you may not be able to use the full
   functionality of this website.

Changing your cookie preferences

   The "Help" menu in the toolbar of most web browsers will tell you how
   to change your browser's cookie settings, including how to have the
   browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable
   cookies altogether. An online guide is available(link is external) if
   you have difficulties trying to change your browser settings.

Cookie terminology

   We have classified our cookies into two broad types - 'first party
   cookies' and 'third party cookies':
     * First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the
       website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognise
       your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your
       preferences as you browse the site.
     * Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of
       the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to
       recognise your computer when it visits other web sites. Third party
       cookies are used for a variety of reasons, most commonly used for
       website analytics or advertising purposes. More details are
       provided in the third party cookie section.

   In addition, cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent
   cookies'. Your computer automatically removes session cookies once you
   close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your computer
   until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached.

Third party cookies set by Cancer Research UK

   We work with a number of third party suppliers who set cookies on our
   website to enable them to provide us with services. These cookies are
   mainly used for reporting and advertising purposes so that we can
   improve the way we communicate with our supporters and ensure the money
   we invest in online advertising is well spent. More information about
   the main suppliers we use and their privacy policies is listed below.


Google DoubleClick

   We use DoubleClick cookies to measure the effectiveness of our online
   advertising. This enables us to ensure that any money we spend on
   digital marketing gives us a good return on investment.

   DoubleClick cookies do two things: 1) they track anonymised conversion
   data so that we can measure advertising effectiveness and 2) they are
   used to serve advertising, enabling us to serve advertisements to or
   exclude people who have visited our website. The cookies also allows us
   to limit the number of times a person sees our advertisement.

   DoubleClick cookies sometimes include a pixel from the advertising
   networks we work with. This allows us to target adverts effectively on
   their networks.

Cookies: DSID, IDE

DoubleClick privacy policy


Google Analytics and Optimize 360

   Google Analytics 360 is a web analytics service provided by Google inc.
   that enables us to measure how people use our website using cookies. We
   use this information to improve our website experience for website
   visitors and to measure the effectiveness of our online advertising. We
   can also use these cookies to serve relevant advertisements to people
   who have interacted with specific sections of the site, or to exclude
   those audiences from advertising.

   For those site visitors who have explicitly opted in to Google’s data
   privacy policy, Google will associate your IP address with other data
   held by Google in order to identify you across multiple devices. You
   may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on
   your browser. You may also stop the transmission of information
   generated by the cookies about your use of the website and of your IP
   address to Google, by downloading and installing the Google Analytics
   Opt-out Broswer Add-on available here
   https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

   Google Optimize allows us to test variants of web pages and see how
   they perform against an objective that we specify. Optimize monitors
   the results of our experiment and tells us which variant has the best
   performance.

   supporters through both unpaid posts and paid advertising. We use
   cookies to measure the effectiveness of paid advertising on Facebook to
   ensure the money we spend is used effectively. They also enable us to
   either service advertisements to or excluse people who have visited our
   website.

   Optimizely is a website analytics tool we use to try different versions

   analytics partners on a short term basis. These help improve the
   effectiveness of our advertising, for example by enabling us to reach
   or exclude our website visitors across partner networks. These cookies
