Presentation

   After years of steady development, the technology of proof assistants
   is currently coming to a mature state. As a matter of fact, it is
   possible today to formalize a non trivial mathematical proof inside a
   computer, and to check its correctness automatically. This “tour de
   force” has been recently achieved for the four color theorem, and a
   certified proof of the classification of finite groups and of the
   Kepler conjecture are on the way.

   These achievements would not have been possible without the rich and
   active mathematics of formal proofs which emerged in the 1970s at the
   frontier of logic and computer science, along the Curry-Howard
   correspondence. This seminal correspondence enables us to understand a
   logical proof (of a given formula) as a well-behaved program (of a
   given type). Besides this by now traditional connection between logic
   and computer science, a number of unexpected connections are currently
   emerging with other fields of mathematics – this including homotopy
   theory, higher dimensional algebra, quantum topology, topos theory,
   functional analysis and operator algebra. Finally, proof assistants
   have been successfully applied to certify properties of programs
   written in high-level languages as well as low-level languages, to
   implement certified compilers, or to establish important security
   properties of protocols.

   The purpose of this thematic trimester is to provide a forum for the
   extended community of researchers and students in mathematics and in
   computer science interested in proof assistants, and more generally, in
   the mathematics of formal proofs. Much care will be devoted during the
   trimester to train the mathematicians interested to learn and to use
   the current proof assistants in their work.

Programme

Pre-school at the CIRM

   A spring school at CIRM is organized from April 7th to April 18th,
   2014. Submission for funding is not possible anymore, but a few rooms
   are still available.
