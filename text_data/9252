#wegood WE GOOD: MEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX

   [WE_GOOD_MEGHAN_BHM.png]

   Today we're pleased to honor Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex. Meghan's
   background as a film and tv actress has allowed her to use her platform
   for good. Meghan's charitable work in communities of color began years
   before becoming the Duchess of Sussex. As a global ambassador for World
   Vision, she traveled to Rwanda to see how access to clean, safe water
   impacts children, an issue that is near and dear to our hearts. She
   also visited and supported the Myna Mahila Foundation in Mumbai, an
   organization that helps solve the menstruation challenges many women
   and girls in the community face.

   She became the Duchess of Sussex following her marriage to Prince Harry
   of the British royal family in May 2018, becoming one of the few Black
   women to join a royal family. Meghan brought many Black traditions to
   her Royal Wedding including a Chicago-based Black pastor, an amazing
   gospel choir, and a young Black cellist. At the wedding her culture was
   front and center, and she and Prince Harry have continued to push the
   race relations dialogue forward both near and far.

   In honor of Black History Month, we bow down to one of our Melanated
   Monas. Congrats on your pregnancy! We wish you so much joy.
