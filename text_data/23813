we did it!

   [newly+married!.jpg]
   It was a perfect day, which can best be summed up as "magic."  Whenever
   anyone asks, that's how I describe it. We were surrounded by love and
   happiness - and lots of crafts! It was a handmade wedding, and I'm
   happy to share the details. More, soon.

   We're inviting a small group of friends & family to the wedding. But we
   can still share this Save the Date, far and wide. We took this photo on
   our recent trip to Vermont. We affectionately refer to this as our
   Welcome Back Kotter / Ben and Jerry's font. Full of woodsy happiness!

Drawing

   Though I'm not sure I've mentioned it here before, by day I'm a
   volunteer coordinator. This past month, I celebrated National Volunteer
   Week by organizing a series of behind-the-scenes talks and tours for
   our volunteers. These secret tours are so much fun! After all, we're
   not ducking into conference rooms, but rather, conservation studios and
   wood shops!  This year we even got stuck in the freight elevator
   together (it made for a fun afternoon).

   I love spending a little extra time with our volunteers, but more than
   anything, I love the opportunity to shed light on my talented
   colleagues, and the amazing work they do. It's also a chance for me to
   introduce a little creativity into my job. Though I have an artist's
   heart, most of my day is spent word-processing in a grey cubicle ...
   did I mention it's in the basement? Oh, the splendour! Never mind. Each
   year, I hand illustrate thank you cards for our speakers. And because
   our photocopier is old, old, old (and chews up card stock) I make them
   all individually. And as we don't have a colour printer, I hand paint
   each one, too.

Craft and the New Economy - Best Parts

   Still playing catch up, back in March I attended Craft and the New
   Economy, a symposium organized by the Ontario Crafts Council, Ontario
   College of Art and Design University, Sheridan College Crafts and
   Design Program, & the Haliburton School of the Arts. All heavy hitters!
   My two favourite speakers: Marie O’Mahony (OCAD U, visiting professor)
   and Dr. Sandra Alfondy (Professor of Craft History at NSCAD University
   and Associate Curator of Fine Craft at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia)
   - my old stomping grounds!
   Marie O’Mahony gave the keynote address, emphasizing the importance of
   good relations between craft and industry. She posited three questions:
   1) Have craft and industry linked? (and if so, what is the nature of
   the link?); 2) Can craft rescue manufacturing from low-cost,
   mass-produced goods?, and, 3) Is technology becoming increasingly
   necessary to prevent the demise of craft. Taking a controversial line
   of argument, and sometimes contradicting herself, Marie had me hooked.
   This snippet from the Sundance feature Hearts and Crafts, profiling the
   artisans employed at Hermes, had me happily daydreaming.
   Sandra Alfondy, a panelist, is a kindred spirit, pure and simple. Her
   talk paid tribute to crafters from a feminist perspective, and sent a
   clear message about the importance of valuing our work, so others would
   too. That’s the kind of discussion I hoped the conference would
   inspire, but it seemed a fringe point.
   Overall, the symposium tried to position a new role for craft in the
   21st century. This seemed more focused toward outsourcing and
   product-design, which left me a bit disappointed, and a bit sad. I
   can’t help but think that craft’s root in handmade, homesteading,
   self-sufficiency, and DIY is what will carry it forward.

  Golly Forever!

   Hello friends!
   The world’s topsy-turvy at present. I have lots of good news to share!
   Best expressed with photo.
   My sweetheart surprised me with an engagement ring, the night before my
   birthday, back in February. We snapped this photo just after the big
   moment. That’s us, underneath a viaduct at York Mills Station (a
   suburban area of Toronto). Not the most glamorous of locales, but
   surely the most romantic. It was just us, a couple of curious raccoons,
   and the graffiti. Urban romance! It was perfect. Check out that
   sparkle!
   The next morning (my birthday), I awoke to diamond earrings to match.
   I’m on top of the moon! The best part of being engaged is sharing the
   news. I just love hearing “it was only a matter of time, you two are
   adorable!” It makes me happy to think that love, quite literally,
   shines through.
   We’re planning a summertime wedding in my parents’ beautiful backyard,
   followed by a reception at a fancy restaurant, with a lakeside view. As
   you can probably guess, I’m most excited about décor! We’re planning a
   paper theme, with lots of greenery; is that cryptic enough? I’ll share
   my progress as the day draws closer. Until then, it’s back to doodling
   ideas. – Holly xo

Working on ...

   I snapped this photo last week in Grange Park; right in the heart of
   the city (would you believe it?) Next up: translating pine cone, with
   spruce tips, in wool felt. That's my kind of challenge. More, soon!
