Hello Friend - Mama Elephant Mini Cat Agenda

   [mini_cat_agenda_04.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   Hello papercrafters! Today I'm sharing a cute card using the new Mama
   Elephant/Hampton Art Mini Cat Agenda stamp and die combo set. This set
   is a new add on to the original Mini Cat Agenda.
   It has twelve of the cutest cats ever in various poses and is just the
   right number to use along with the Grid Window frame cuts. For the
   sentiment, I have used the Hello Friend Script die and is just the
   perfect size to go across over the frames.
   [ME_Hamptonart_mini_cat_agenda.jpg]
   [mini_cat_agenda_01.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   The cats were a lot of fun to colour in, they have been stamped first
   with Hero Arts Intense Black ink and then coloured with Copic markers.
   The coordinating dies greatly help to cut the cats out and just brings
   them to life.
   To help display each of  the cats, I die cut out the Grid Window Frame
   using the heavier weight 110 lbs Neena White cardstock. I die cut out
   three to get extra thickness and height to make the frame pop.
   [mini_cat_agenda_02.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   The background has been ink blended using Ranger distress oxide inks:
   Fossilized Amber, Spiced Marmalade, Abandoned Coral and Wilted Violet.
   The four colours make up the bands for each of the four rows in a ombre
   gradient effect. I then splattered water with a paint brush to get the
   subtle water distress effects for added texture.
   The Hello Friend Scripty die has been die cut out three times to get a
   chipboard look in black cardstock.
   All the cute cats have been adhered with foam dimensionals to make them
   pop as well as clear glossy accents and clear Wink of Stella for the
   items they are holding and wearing.

   This set is available to pre-order from Bizzy Becs Online Store and is
   such a great value as a combo set. It's great for many occasions from
   cards to planners and especially to cat lovers.
   Thank you so much for stopping by, till next time - Happy Crafting!

   Hello papercrafters! Here's another card using the wonderful Fairy
   Kisses set from Hero Arts along with a few extra sets to create and
   compliment the scene.
   The Fairy Kisses set is available to pre-order from Bizzy Bec's Online
   Store.

   Bright Bold Prints stamp inside card.
   Images stamped with Hero Art intense black ink and coloured with Copic

   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   [thankyou_fairymuch_04.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   Inside the card, Star Light Star Bright bold prints have been stamped
   using Orchid, Passion Flower and Soft Pool Hero Arts inks in an ombre

   The die cut window frame opening is a great way to incorporate the

Bizzy Becs June Challenge - Fairy Kisses

   [fairykisses_01.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   Hello papercrafters! Today I'm sharing a card created for Bizzy Bec's
   June challenge. The theme is Anything Goes and the winner of the
   challenge will receive 5 digital stamps of their choice. Click here to
   enter.
   I couldn't wait to have a play with this new stamp set that I ordered
   through Bizzy Bec's online store. It's the Hero Arts Fairy Kisses stamp
   & die combo. Fairy themed sets are a personal favourite and just love
   the artwork and imagery in this set.
   I have a kept a pretty clean and simple design making the swirl of
   rainbow colours be the focal point to highlight the cute sentiment,
   'all you need is love and a littely pixie dust'.
   I first die cut out the window frame using the Hero Arts Milky Way
   window fancy die using Neenah white solar 80lbs cardstock.
   I then ink blended the background using several Ranger distress inks
   with a mini round ink blending tool. I have used Strathmore Bristol
   smooth paper as it gives a smooth effortless blending and can hold
   water droplet effects which adds a subtle texture to the background.
   I then stamped the images with Hero Arts intense black ink on Neehan
   solar white 80lbs cardstock, and coloured them in with copic markers. I
   used the coordinating dies to die cut out the images. To make the
   sentiment fit I placed the die cut Milky Way window horizontally and
   works well with this layout. The fairy and flowers have been arranged
   to compliment the space.
   The sentiment as well as the pixie dust has been stamped with Versamark
   and then white heat embossed ensuring that it lines up the fairy.
   Both the Milky Way window and fairy image has been mounted up with
   foam/foam dimensionals to make them pop.
   I hope you have been inspired and can't wait to see what you create for
   Bizzy Bec's June challenge.
   The Fairy Kisses stamp & die combo set is available to preorder through
   Bizzy Bec's online store as well as Ranger distress inks.
   Thank you so much for stopping by, 'til next time - Happy Crafting! :)
   Supplies used:
   Hero Arts Fairy Kisses stamp & die combo
   Hero Arts Milky Way window fancy die
   Hero Arts Intense black ink
   Copic markers
   Ranger distress inks: Fossilized amber, Faded jeans, Wilted
   violet,Cracked pistachio, Peacock feathers, Abandoned coral.

Waffle Flower - Party Time!

   [WF_limo_ride_01.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   Hello papercrafters!  Today I'm sharing a fun pop up card from Waffle
   Flower, Limo Ride and the 3D Pop Up card die from Mama Elephant for
   extra fun! The critters in this set are so cute and just love the
   vintage retro car they're in fully decorated with party celebrations.
   [WF_limo_ride_02.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   The images have been stamped with Hero Arts intense black ink and copic
   coloured. Coordinating dies have been used to cut them out and having
   them pop up in the card in a box just brings the scene to life.
   Pool Party cardstock from Stampin' Up! has been used for 3D pop up card
   and wanted to use a similar colour to match the car as well as keep
   that pastel colour scheme. The green inserts have been coloured with
   Ranger distress ink Mowed lawn with a round sponge blending tool. A
   picket fence has been added at the back and coloured with Ranger
   distress ink Rusty Hinge. The cloudy background has been ink blended
   with Ranger distress ink Broken China using the MFT cloud stencil.
   [WF_limo_ride_03.jpg]
   [pinit_fg_en_round_red_16.png]
   It was a lot of fun creating and colouring in this card and makes a fun
   and unique birthday card to give to someone special. Thanks so much for
   stopping by, 'til next time - Happy Crafting! :)
