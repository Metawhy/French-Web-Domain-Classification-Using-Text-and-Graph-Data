Mag. 24 - #12 Cabled Hat

   This beanie in ALASKA yarn is super practical for winter.

   Youll love making the bobble, which is a big contrast with the beanie.

   The pretty central cable adds nice structure to the pattern.

   Stitches used: 1 x 1 rib and stocking stitches.

   Needles: 5 and 6.5 mm. A cable needle will make things easier.

   Machine wash in a muslin bag.
