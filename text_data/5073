PowerShell is open sourced and is available on Linux

   August 19, 2016 / Ravi Kumar / 1 Comment

   PowerShell is open sourced and available on Linux. PowerShell is a
   task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on the .NET
   Framework to help IT professionals control and automate the
   administration of the Windows, and now Linux, operating systems and the
   applications that run on them.

                                MSPowershell

   Today’s customers live in a multi-platform, multi-cloud, multi-OS world
   – that’s just reality. This world brings new challenges and customers
   need tools to make everything work together. Microsoft is working
   company-wide to deliver management tools that empower customers to
   manage any platform, from anywhere, on any device, using Linux or
   Windows. This shift to a more open, customer-obsessed approach to
   deliver innovation is one of the things that makes me most excited to
   come to work every day.
