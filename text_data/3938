   (Play) üîä Listen

   Most dyslexics will exhibit about 10 of the following traits and
   behaviors. These characteristics can vary from day-to-day or
   minute-to-minute. The most consistent thing about dyslexics is their
   inconsistency.

General:

   two small children with books

   Dyslexic children and adults can become avid and enthusiastic readers

       read, write, or spell at grade level.
     * Labelled lazy, dumb, careless, immature, ‚Äúnot trying hard enough,‚Äù

       setting.
     * High in IQ, yet may not test well academically; tests well orally,
       but not written.
     * Feels dumb; has poor self-esteem; hides or covers up weaknesses

     * Seems to ‚ÄúZone out‚Äù or daydream often; gets lost easily or loses
       track of time.
     * Difficulty sustaining attention; seems ‚Äúhyper‚Äù or ‚Äúdaydreamer.‚Äù
     * Learns best through hands-on experience, demonstrations,
       experimentation, observation, and visual aids.

Vision, Reading, and Spelling:

     * Complains of dizziness, headaches or stomach aches while reading.
     * Confused by letters, numbers, words, sequences, or verbal
       explanations.
     * Reading or writing shows repetitions, additions, transpositions,
       omissions, substitutions, and reversals in letters, numbers and/or
       words.
     * Complains of feeling or seeing non-existent movement while reading,
       writing, or copying.
     * Seems to have difficulty with vision, yet eye exams don‚Äôt reveal a

     * Clumsy, uncoordinated, poor at ball or team sports; difficulties
       with fine and/or gross motor skills and tasks; prone to
       motion-sickness.
     * Can be ambidextrous, and often confuses left/right, over/under.

Math and Time Management:

     * Has difficulty telling time, managing time, learning sequenced
       information or tasks, or being on time.
     * Computing math shows dependence on finger counting and other
       tricks; knows answers, but can‚Äôt do it on paper.
     * Can count, but has difficulty counting objects and dealing with
       money.
     * Can do arithmetic, but fails word problems; cannot grasp algebra or
       higher math.

       I was smiling as I read down through the signs of dyslexia. I‚Äôm
       always confused between my right and left hand, whenever I am
       baffled, I raise my hands, I think which hand is used for writing
       and once I get the answer I will be able to determine which is
       which. Having hard time also reading analog watch, poor health ‚Äî
       always have ear infection, too emotional, perfectionist ever since,
       keen sighted, always reversing letters ei to ie, uo to ou in words
       having those letters and always late in school LOL. But I don‚Äôt
       tell anyone, I think no one will believe me and I don‚Äôt know what
       to do with it

       How can i go about getting my son assessed?
       my son is now 15 years old and is terrified of having to do exams
       next year. I have asked at the school several times as my son has
       many of the above characteristics and states that he has lots of
       ideas/thoughts in his head but can‚Äôt get them down on paper. The
       school told me that although he was behind for his age it was just
       because he needed to work harder. I also mentioned it the the
       Doctor, who said that Health visitors used to be able to help with
       this but they don‚Äôt get involved with things like that anymore and
       just said it would have be the school that got him assessed.
       I feel that over the last 4-5 years he has been completely let down
       by the school and the other systems.
       Please can you advice the best way of getting him assessed.
       Many Thanks

            You can find information about formal testing for dyslexia
            here:
            https://www.dyslexia.com/question/who-can-diagnose/
            Keep in mind that a formal diagnosis is not required for a
            Davis Dyslexia Correction program. You can find a Davis
            facilitator near you at https://www.davismethod.org/ If your
            son wants help, working with a Davis provider might be the
            best way to help him meet his goals.

       Can someone with so many of your stated dyslexic characteristics,
       but who had no trouble reading or writing, also be dyslexic? Is it
       a spectrum?

            Yes, dyslexia does occur along a spectrum and it is very
            possible for a person to have many characteristics that are
            tied to dyslexia without specific difficulties with reading
            and writing. Sometimes this will be labeled differently ‚Äî for
            example, if the person has primary difficulties in math, it
            might be called ‚Äúdyscalculia‚Äù ‚Äî but the underlying cause may
            be the same.

       If reversing letters/numbers or putting letters/numbers out of
       order is not Dyslexia, what is it?

            Reversing letters/numbers and putting letters/numbers out of
            order is a common but not universal symptom of dyslexia. We
            believe it is caused by disorientation and we always provide
            individuals with tools for addressing those problems in every
            Davis Dyslexia Correction program.
            As you can see, these symptoms are listed under the ‚ÄúVision,
            Reading, and Spelling‚Äù section on this page.

       Am happy finally to discover what I have been suffering from, I
       have had a challenge with my memory I read or write something and
       within a second it disappears.
       I hope I will be helped this time a round.
       Thanks.

       Dyslexia is seen as a problem, and an industry has grown up to
       eradicate it. From what I see, it was not a problem for thousands
       of years, and not until the advent of universal reading and writing
       evolved. Since our schools are language centric, educators see
       those with dyslexia as being handicapped, and put massive efforts
       into trying to correct it. This is similar to a once common
       practice of forcing left handed people to write with their right
       hand. Today no educator would accept this as needing correction.
       Given the use of quill or nib pens, the left handed writer would
       smear the wet ink. With the advent of the pencil, ball point pens,
       and felt tip pens there was no need to be overly concerned that a
       person would use their preferred hand. It is a crime that schools
       put so much energy in trying to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the symptoms of dyslexia,
       and put NO effort in building on its strengths. We have learned
       nothing in 200 years of pedagogy.

            Yikes‚Ä¶for thousands of years humankind didn‚Äôt have the means
            to address vision impairments either. Does that mean people
            should walk around without glasses? There are programs and
            approaches that can help reduce the literacy struggles for
            individuals with dyslexia and allow them to lead fuller lives
            in a modern society that largely hinges upon consumption of
            printed information. That doesn‚Äôt mean someone can‚Äôt listen to
            audio books or get other assistive technology to help
            accommodate the deficit, but I believe it‚Äôs a disservice to
            take this kind of hard-line admiration of disability that does
            not seek to help the individual function at a maximal level
            within the constraints of the disability.

The Davis Experience

     Jonathan has made huge strides; his grades are a full letter better
     in each subject.  He doesn‚Äôt resist homework, even writing
     assignments!  His spelling has improved dramatically and he reads
     for pleasure.  He‚Äôs clearly happier and more confident and fun to be
     around.

Dyslexia is the gift of mastery

   Dyslexia and similar learning differences stem from innate patterns of
   thinking and learning that are associated with high levels of
   creativity and strong problem-solving and three-dimensional thinking
   abilities.

   Difficulties with reading, writing, and spelling commonly associated
   with dyslexia can be corrected with strategies geared to the innate
   strengths shared by dyslexic individuals of all ages.

   When adults and children learn how to harness and use their innate
   strengths, they have the capacity to excel in all realms.

The Davis Experience

     I could hardly read at all before I started the programme. For the
     first time, I finished a book without getting frustrated or angry. I
     pinched a book from primary school because I wanted to read it and
     now over 30 years later I can read it. I am more mellow now and
     starting to be me again. I‚Äôve found myself! This course works ‚Äì
     better than anything else I‚Äôve tried.
