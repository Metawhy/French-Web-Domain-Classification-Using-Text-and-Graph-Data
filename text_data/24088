Sunday Sneaky Peek

   December 5, 2010

   Hope you guys are having a great Sunday. We’re on the way to a birthday
   party, but this morning was spent having a party with my glue gun (wow,
   that sounds pathetic!) Thought I’d give you a little sneaky peek at
   today’s project.

   This is also my first ‘mobile post,’ so I’m feeling pretty techie. Uh
   oh, that’s all I need, easier access to random postings! Enjoy the rest
   of your weekend, Sweets!

       As we were trimming our bushes this weekend I was thinking "hey, I
       should make a wreath" what's wrong with me?! Can't wait to see the
       whole thing

       Your wreath is looking beautiful, Cassie. I love the simplicity of
       the white bow. Have a good Sunday afternoon!

       I'm jealous! I want to be a mobile techie too. Maybe Santa will
       make that a possibility this Christmas.
       ps- I have a blister the size of a golf ball on my thumb from using
       the glue gun to glue shells to my Santa hat.

Friends, How Many of Us Have Them? (ooops, & Calendar Winners!)

   January 15, 2011

   Do you have any friends that you instantly felt connected to? A friend
   who you sometimes wonder if you’re the same person because you’re so
   similar, in so many ways? Not the same kind of friend as one you’ve
   known your whole life, but one you couldn’t live your life without?

   [jcrewcuts6.jpg]

   Our whole house is buzzing with joy because our good friend, the
   missing family member, is visiting from Nashville! Saying goodbye to
   her was the hardest thing about leaving our adopted hometown.
   Fortunately, our friendship stuck, and it’s only grown stronger…and
   we’ve somehow managed to see each other many times in the 5 years since
   we’ve moved away.

   Picnik collage

   Our girls were born the same month, and have developed their own sweet
   friendship. They’ve been flying to see each other since they were 3
   months old (not unaccompanied, duh.)

   Picnik collage

   And talk about a special relationship, she and my son fell in love when
   he was only 1-year-old! He served as the ring-bearer in her wedding,
   and she is his cherished Godmother.

   Picnik collage

   Oh yeah, did I mention she’s also a hair-stylist to the stars?!? Yep,
   we actually met because she did my hair…then discovered we went to the
   same church…and it took off from there. You may have heard of some of
   her clients….Kelly Clarkson and Sheryl Crow ring a bell? So while Mr.
   Sugarplum does a bang-up job, he doesn’t compare to the ‘Do’ she’ll be
   hooking me up with this weekend!

   She and her sweet girl have been here since Wednesday, and it’s been
   non-stop laughing, Mexican food, hair, American Girl store and cafe,
   field trips and fun! Here’s hoping you’re having a fabulous weekend
   surrounded by your favorite people too!

   {Oh, and oopsie…sorry I forgot about the Calendar Winners yesterday,
   bleach must have soaked through to my brain. Random.com chose coolkids,
   Natalie Marie, and Kyra at Racks and Mooby….shoot me an email girls
   with your address and I’ll pop the cute calendars in the mail for you.}

       That really is so sweet and let's be honest, good friends are
       *VERY* hard to find! (c: My best friend ever still has to be my
       little sister, Kara, and when she moved, it was so hard. Thank
       goodness we still get to see each other pretty often so we can get
       in some good shenaninganizing…

       really are never the same. So special. Enjoy every second of it.

       Those kind of friends are Priceless! I'm so glad you are getting to
       spend some time together. AND she does hair?? What does she think
       of Mr. SG doing your hair? I never would have guessed- you didn't
       tell me that when we were in the bathroom . . . 😉

{Guest Post} Kate at Centsational Girl

   January 14, 2011

   [5266756745_2ac97787e6-10.jpg]

   Today marks the final day of this fun series. I hope you’ve enjoyed it
   as much as me, and discovered some new blogs along the way. Blogging
   has become such a blessing in my life, as I’ve met the most inspiring,
   talented and kind-hearted people….and all on the internets!
   I was honored to have such a lineup of stellar bloggers for this
   series, and it’s only fitting to end with the Grand Puba herself….Kate
   from Centsational Girl! Her blog was one of the first I fell for (and
   fell hard!), and my head almost popped off when she featured my son’s
   room on her blog. Her projects are impeccable and affordable, and her
   tutorials easy to understand and follow. She has helped to instill in
   me the power and satisfaction of Doing-It-Myself!
   ***

   Hi all, it’s me Kate, visiting today at Cassie’s place. Please excuse
   me while I take off my shoes and kick up my feet on her coffee
   table. Just makin’ myself at home! Heh heh. I’m a little tired cause
   I’ve been busy!  2010 brought three new favorite spaces to my
   place. Here are my three favorite room makeovers from last year, filled
   top to bottom with all sorts of DIY projects.  Enjoy!
   Staircase

   Laundry Room

   Grown-Up Girl’s Room
   [cggrownupgirlsroom_thumb.jpg]

   Thanks Kate!! I loved the rooms then, and even more now!

   Thank you to all the fabulous bloggers that shared their time and
   projects with us during this Best of the Best series! We are so
   inspired by you and can’t wait to see what projects you accomplish in
   2011!

       I do believe I missed seeing Kate's laundry room, to have a window,
       and some storage and counter space…just wonderful! This has been a
       fun series to read and thanks for including me!

       Way to end it with a bang. So love Kate. I don't think I had seen
       her little girl's room. Fabulous.
       Great series, Cassie!

       Love Kate. She was one of my first favorites as well! And a total
       mentor/inspiration in regards to blogging, being a lawyer, etc. And
       her style… I could go on! 🙂

       Hi Cassie, I'm late to this par-tay but oh so grateful to be on
       your list of inspiring people. Isn't the blog world grand? I too
       will miss this series, but look forward to hearing your voice soon!

{Guest Post} Erin at Crafts & Sutch

   January 13, 2011

   [5266756745_2ac97787e6-9.jpg]

   Erin from Crafts & Sutch is another one of my blogger buds, and I’ve
   really enjoyed getting to know her. She astounds me with all she
   juggles…a full-time job that requires lots of travel, a toddler, and a
   successful blog. She also creates and features amazing crafts, and has
   taught herself how to write HTML code (she does all the technical stuff
   for her blog too!). I’m thrilled to welcome her, and you’ll be thrilled
   with the little gift she’s giving us!!
   ***
   Hello, Hi Sugarplum! Readers!  I’m so excited Cassie invited me over to
   hang out for the day. I just adore Hi Sugarplum! In fact, the first
   time I visited Cassie’s blog, I read it ALL…from end to start.  🙂
   (Cassie butting in: Take note readers, Erin is now Teacher’s Pet!) She
   is certainly one classy, sassy, and super funny gal, so any friend of
   hers is a friend of mine.
   I’m Erin from Crafts & Sutch. I love all things crafty and have [DEL:
   un :DEL] officially been diagnosed with “I can make that” syndrome. I
   am constantly inspired by the things I see, so I like to create a
   little bit of everything.
   [blogbutton.jpg] [IMG_3456a.jpg]
   With January in full swing, I know many of you are working hard on
   keeping resolutions. I thought I would share one of my favorite
   projects from last year that can help your family stay on top of
   things.
   [Message-Frame.jpg]
   This dry erase message center is perfect for leaving little messages or
   reminders for the hubs or the monkey (who can’t read yet, but I still
   love to leave him “I love you”s).  This idea could easily transform
   into a monthly calendar or a weekly meal planner. It’s affordable, easy
   to do, and you could probably make it with things you already have. 🙂
   I love playing around in Photoshop and the printables I created have
   been my most popular posts.  I made this one for Halloween.
   [Orange-and-Black-Broom-Fits.jpg]
   and these thankful lunch sack notes for Thanksgiving.
   [Lunch-Notes-Thanksgiving.jpg]
   They were such a big hit that I made two versions for Christmastime…one
   for the kiddos and one for your sweetie.
   [Lunch-Notes-Holiday-Partner.jpg]
   Aren’t they the cutest?  I’ve already been thinking about the
   Valentine’s messages.  Any suggestions?
   So with Valentine’s Day just around the corner, I made this printable
   especially and exclusively for Hi Sugarplum! readers! 🙂
   [All-you-need-is-love.jpg]
   To download, click on the image, click one more time to view the full
   resolution, right-click and select Save Image As, name the file and
   click save. Then you can print it out, pop it in a frame, and get a
   little, warm and fuzzy feeling when you see it. 🙂
   I’ve had a ton of fun today!  Thanks so much for letting me spend some
   time with you. And thank you, Cassie, for inviting me! I hope you all
   will stop by Crafts & Sutch to say hi!

                                 Photobucket

   Thanks so much, Erin!!! She knows I’m a sucker for a
   printable…especially a free custom one! I’ll be displaying this cutie
   to get in the Valentine spirit! Go check out her blog for more fun &
   easy Crafty Projects!

   We’re wrapping this series tomorrow, and trust me, you don’t want to
   miss this gal! Also, today is your last chance to enter for a cute
   calendar giveaway here, winner announced tomorrow!
