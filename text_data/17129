Spotlight Feature: Own Something Exclusive

   Morning Dolls!
   Today I want to bring an amazing designer to your attention! I wanted
   to feature Own Something Different because I was moved by the story of
   the designer, shown on her website.
   "Own Something Exclusive (O.S.E) was created by Visionary Ose
   Ogbemudia.  Working in the fashion industry for over seven years then
   branching off to building and running her first plus-size women's
   boutique Ose(Uh-Seh) Vintage Wear, Ose O. knew that her DNA included
   creating original product, and building her own brand and empire. Own
   Something Exclusive is a brand that embodies the exclusive lifestyle.
   No one person is the same, and no one product should be the same so
   O.S.E offers exclusive made-to-order product for clients. Because this
   brand is developing new product categories every season, O.S.E stands
   by its motto of 'We don't follow trends, we follow our voice'."
    After reading that, I had to reach out to her! Check her out below!

Shay Renae - The Collection

   Hey Dolls, Happy New Year!
   Over the past few months, I've been taking you with me on a sewing
   journey (via Facebook). This would also explain the lack of posts
   (sorry). I started sewing in March and it has been a wild and crazy
   ride learning the basics skills needed to even sew in a straight line.
   Through it all I feel like I have found what I'm truly passionate
   about. With that being said. I would like to present you Shay Renae -
   The Collection.
