Consumer Online Profile and Opt-out

   MANAGE YOUR CONSUMER ONLINE PROFILE WITH US

   Almost every major Web publisher, advertiser and ad network uses
   cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect data to optimize
   advertising effectiveness. We’re no different. We use cookies and other
   standard web technologies (like tags and pixels) to collect certain
   types of information automatically from your device. Some of this
   information (including for example your IP addresses and certain unique
   device identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device, and
   may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the
   European Union.

   We use this information to enable us and our customers to make more
   intelligent ad decisions, which results in more relevant (rather than
   more annoying) advertising and help our customers make more money. This
   helps you continue to enjoy free online content and services. To find
   out more about how we may collect and use your personal information
   through our technology, please review our Advertising
   Technology Privacy Policy.

   You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads through our technology by
   using the opt-out tool below. Once you opt-out, we will no longer
   collect any information from your device and as a result, we will no
   longer serve you ads that are more targeted to your interests.

   The opt-out operates by placing a cookie on your device that is unique
   to the browser and device you use to opt-out. If you change browsers or
   computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to
   opt-out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a
   cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.

   Your device may also give you the ability to opt-out of the use of
   information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are
   targeted to your interests (“Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out
   of Ads Personalization” on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” on
   iOS devices). You may stop the collection of location information by
   particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing
   the preferences on your mobile device.

   This policy applies to the information Rubicon Project (“Rubicon
   Project,” “we” or “us”) collects and receives from individuals (“end
   users” or “you“) who interact with Digital Media Properties (defined
   below) that use Rubicon Project’s technology to provide you with ads.
   Rubicon Project is committed to transparency, and we want you to fully
   understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to
   individuals (like you), and the choices that are available to you.

   Please note:

   This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of data
   on our website (http://www.rubiconproject.com) – that information can
   be found here; or (ii) our clients’ collection, use and disclosure of
   information through their Digital Media Properties (defined below),
   which is governed by their own privacy policies and practices.  For
   these purposes, our clients include advertisers and publishers as
   described below under the heading “About Us.”

   About Us

   Rubicon Project provides a digital advertising technology platform and
   related services that connects advertising buyers (advertisers) with
   sellers (publishers) of advertising inventory. For example, advertisers
   (or their agents) may use our technology to buy advertising for display
   on publishers’ websites, mobile applications and other digital media
   properties (which we collectively refer to as “Digital Media
   Properties”). We also provide related software and APIs for developers.
   You can find out more about this here.

   Information We Collect

   When you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our technology, we
   collect certain information about you and your device (“User
   Information“). Some of this information (including for example your IP
   addresses and certain unique device identifiers), may identify a
   particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in
   some jurisdictions, including the European Union.

   Information that we collect includes:
     * Information about your behavior on our publishers’ Digital Media
       Properties: including information about the domain, your referring
       website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search
       keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites,
       referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation
       (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic
       coordinates if you have enabled location services on your device),
       click data, types of advertisements viewed;
     * Information about your browser: including information about your
       browser type and language, and browser history;
     * Information about your device: including information about your IP
       address, device make, device model, device operating system, device
       operating system version, and data connection type; and
     * Information about your Internet service: including information
       about which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use.

   We do not collect any “sensitive” or “special categories of personal
   data” as defined under European data protection laws.

   How We Collect User Information

   We use cookies and other standard web technologies to collect
   information automatically from your device.  Please review our Platform
   Cookie Statement for further information.

   Other technologies: Additionally, we use other technologies, including
   local storage, to collect User Information in order to assist with the
   delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.

   In addition, we also work with third party advertising platforms that
   separately collect and use User Information to enable our and their
   customers to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising
   technology. As an example, we work with companies that use information
   about your visits to various websites or applications across multiple
   devices in order to provide you content and ads of interest across
   those devices. Our customers may use this third-party data in
   combination with your User Information to deliver you targeted ads
   across multiple devices.

   How We Use User Information

   We primarily use the User Information we collect to enable our clients
   to buy and sell advertising space on Digital Media Properties. In
   particular, our customers use information we provide, in conjunction
   with other information they have independently collected, to deliver
   end users targeted advertising they believe will be of particular
   interest to those users based on interests that might be inferred from
   the User Information that we collect. For more information about how
   targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising
   Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page
   at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/h
   ow-does-it-work.

   We may also use the User Information we collect for our legitimate
   business interests:
     * To operate and improve our technology;
     * To compile statistics and conduct research and development for our
       internal business purposes – all of which is done in aggregate
       without identifying you;
     * To enable standard advertising controls;
     * To prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;
     * To analyze and report on ad performance (such as tracking views of
       ad, as well as click-through rates on ads), campaign reporting, and
       campaign forecasting; and
     * To protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent,
       unauthorized, or illegal activity.

   Legal basis for Processing User Information (EEA and UK end users only)

   If you are an end user located in the European Economic Area or the
   United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the User
   Information described above will depend on the User Information
   concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

   However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect User
   Information from you, except where such interests are overridden by
   your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
   Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your User
   Information, they include the interests described in the section headed
   “How We Use User Information“.

   In some cases, we may rely on your consent or have a legal obligation
   to collect User Information from you or may otherwise need the User
   Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
   If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your User Information,
   we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.

   If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
   legal basis on which we collect and use your User Information, please
   contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us”
   heading below.

   Information Retention

   We never store any data longer than we think we need it. The cookies
   set out on your device expire no later than 366 days after they were
   last accessed.  We typically store the User Information we collect,
   such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90
   days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
   User Information we no longer need is deleted from either the cookies
   or our servers (as applicable).

   In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer
   periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law
   enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to
   corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial
   reporting legislation.

   Sharing of User Information

   We share User Information that we collect as follows:
     * Customer: We share User Information with our advertiser clients to
       help them identify and buy advertising on publishers’ Digital Media
       Properties. Clients may use this information in conjunction with
       other information they have independently collected to provide you
       targeted advertising and to help them evaluate whether a particular
       ad campaign may be of interest to you.
     * Rubicon Project Affiliates: We share User Information with other
       companies in The Rubicon Project group of companies to use for any
       of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
     * Business Transfers: We may share User Information in connection
       with the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or
       assets to a third party buyer.
     * Vital interest, legal rights and compliance with laws. We may share
       User Information with law enforcement, regulatory authorities,
       courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services or other
       necessary third parties for legal, protection, security, and safety
       purposes, including:
          + to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond
            to lawful requests and legal process;
          + to protect the rights and property of Rubicon Project, our
            agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our
            agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our
            network and physical assets; and/or
          + to protect the safety of our employees and agents, our
            customers, or any person.
     * Vendors, partners and other service providers: We may share User
       Information with our vendors and partners who perform functions on
       our or our clients’ behalf and require access to such information
       to provide us with services or do work for us. Examples include:
       analyzing data, fraud prevention, hosting data, engaging technical
       support for our technology platform, and performing analysis
       related to our technology platform and related services.

   Information Our Customers and Vendors Collect

   Our clients, our vendors, and our clients’ vendors, who use our
   technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar
   technology (or those of their other affiliates) within their
   advertisements and on certain websites. We are not responsible for our
   clients, vendors and/or our clients’ vendors use of such tracking
   technologies or for their privacy practices.

   Your Opt-Out Choices

   There are many ways to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising that
   our clients may conduct using our technology. Note that different
   devices use different identifiers and different technologies, so that
   you must opt out separately from each browser and each device that you
   would like to be opted out.  If you opt-out of targeted advertising, we
   will no longer collect User Information described above from your
   device.

   Display

   Should you wish to opt-out of the use of information about the websites
   you visit in order to deliver targeted advertising to you using our
   “display” technology, you can do so using the opt-out tool on our
   website,
   at http://rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-ou
   t/.

   Additionally, you can opt-out by using any of the following three
   mechanisms. First, because we are a member of the NAI and adhere to the
   NAI’s code of conduct and mobile code of conduct, you can opt-out of
   targeted advertising by participating companies, including Rubicon
   Project, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Second, because
   we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory
   Principles, you can visit the DAA’s opt-out page
   at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Third, for users located in the
   European Union, Rubicon Project also adheres to the Interactive
   Advertising Bureau of Europe’s Online Behavioral Advertising Framework.
   Accordingly, EU-based users can opt-out of targeted advertising through
   the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page
   at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.

   Please note that these opt-outs operate by placing a cookie on your
   device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt-out.
   They may not function properly if you have configured your browser to
   reject certain cookies. If you change browsers or computers, or delete
   the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again. You also
   can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to
   block most cookies, including ours.

   Mobile

   Your device may give you the ability to opt-out of the use of
   information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are
   targeted to your interests (“Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out
   of Ads Personalization” on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” on
   iOS devices). You may stop the collection of location information by
   particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing
   the preferences on your mobile device. For more information on how to
   change your preferences, please see
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.

   European Data Subject Rights

   If you are a resident of a country in the European Economic Area
   (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK“), you have certain rights and
   protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use
   of information about you.  As stated above, the information that we
   collect about you when you visit Digital Media Properties that use our
   advertising technology may include certain digital identifiers that are
   considered “personal data” under European law.

   As a resident of those countries, you have the right to: (i) to request
   access and obtain a copy of your User Information, (ii) to request
   rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your User
   Information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
   circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing
   of your User Information.

   If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our Data
   Subject Rights policy for instructions on how to do so:
   http://rubiconproject.com/terms-conditions/subject-access-request-polic
   y/. Please note that because most of the information we store can only
   identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you
   individually, you need to provide us with some additional information
   to enable us to identify the User Information we hold about you, if
   any, and ensure that we accurately fulfill your request.

   In addition, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications
   from Rubicon Project. If you would like to exercise this right, please
   write to us at the contact details provided below.

   Finally, as a resident of the EEA or UK, you have the right to lodge a
   complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data
   Protection Authority.  For contact details of your relevant local Data
   Protection Authority, please see here:
   http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-p
   rotection-authorities/index_en.htm.

   Security

   We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures
   to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems.
   Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however,
   can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all
   reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.

   Changes to this Policy

   We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
   example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or
   regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this policy, we will
   notify you of any material changes by posting the revised policy on
   this website, and where necessary, by any other means required by
   applicable law.

   Data Transfers for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)

   Rubicon Project is a global company headquartered in the United States
   with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.
   If you are accessing any of the Digital Media Properties from outside
   the United States, please be aware that your data may be transferred
   to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates in our facilities in
   the United States and other countries (including in Hong Kong, Brazil,
   Japan, Singapore and Australia, where our global affiliates have
   offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your User
   Information.

   These countries (including the United States) may not provide a level
   of data protection for your User Information that would be considered
   adequate as determined by the European Commission, or have data
   protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We
   will however ensure that where Rubicon Project group companies or third
   party service providers receive User Information outside of the EEA,
   appropriate protections are in place under European data protection
   legislation.

   In this regard, The Rubicon Project, Inc. and its US subsidiaries,
   Rubicon Project Hopper, Inc. and Rubicon Project Apex, Inc. have
   self-certified to the Privacy Shield (see below) to ensure that
   appropriate safeguards are in place when personal information is
   transferred outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland.

   If you would like to learn more about the safeguards we put in place
   for international transfers, please contact us using the contact
   details further below.

   Privacy Shield

   Hopper Inc. and Rubicon Project Apex, Inc., comply with the EU-US and
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of
   Commerce with respect to personal information concerning individuals
   from the EEA, the UK and Switzerland. Please see our Privacy Shield
   Notice to learn more.

   If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and
   the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall
   govern.

Consumer Online Profile and Opt-out

   MANAGE YOUR CONSUMER ONLINE PROFILE WITH US

   Almost every major Web publisher, advertiser and ad network uses
   cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect data to optimize
   advertising effectiveness. We’re no different. We use cookies and other
   standard web technologies (like tags and pixels) to collect certain
   types of information automatically from your device. Some of this
   information (including for example your IP addresses and certain unique
   device identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device, and
   may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the
   European Union.

   We use this information to enable us and our customers to make more
   intelligent ad decisions, which results in more relevant (rather than
   more annoying) advertising and help our customers make more money. This
   helps you continue to enjoy free online content and services. To find
   out more about how we may collect and use your personal information
   through our technology, please review our Advertising
   Technology Privacy Policy.

   You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads through our technology by
   using the opt-out tool below. Once you opt-out, we will no longer
   collect any information from your device and as a result, we will no
   longer serve you ads that are more targeted to your interests.

   The opt-out operates by placing a cookie on your device that is unique
   to the browser and device you use to opt-out. If you change browsers or
   computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to
   opt-out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a
   cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.

   Your device may also give you the ability to opt-out of the use of
   information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are
   targeted to your interests (“Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out
   of Ads Personalization” on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” on
   iOS devices). You may stop the collection of location information by
   particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing
   the preferences on your mobile device.

   This policy applies to the information Rubicon Project (“Rubicon
   Project,” “we” or “us”) collects and receives from individuals (“end
   users” or “you“) who interact with Digital Media Properties (defined
   below) that use Rubicon Project’s technology to provide you with ads.
   Rubicon Project is committed to transparency, and we want you to fully
   understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to
   individuals (like you), and the choices that are available to you.

   Please note:

   This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of data
   on our website (http://www.rubiconproject.com) – that information can
   be found here; or (ii) our clients’ collection, use and disclosure of
   information through their Digital Media Properties (defined below),
   which is governed by their own privacy policies and practices.  For
   these purposes, our clients include advertisers and publishers as
   described below under the heading “About Us.”

   About Us

   Rubicon Project provides a digital advertising technology platform and
   related services that connects advertising buyers (advertisers) with
   sellers (publishers) of advertising inventory. For example, advertisers
   (or their agents) may use our technology to buy advertising for display
   on publishers’ websites, mobile applications and other digital media
   properties (which we collectively refer to as “Digital Media
   Properties”). We also provide related software and APIs for developers.
   You can find out more about this here.

   Information We Collect

   When you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our technology, we
   collect certain information about you and your device (“User
   Information“). Some of this information (including for example your IP
   addresses and certain unique device identifiers), may identify a
   particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in
   some jurisdictions, including the European Union.

   Information that we collect includes:
     * Information about your behavior on our publishers’ Digital Media
       Properties: including information about the domain, your referring
       website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search
       keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites,
       referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation
       (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic
       coordinates if you have enabled location services on your device),
       click data, types of advertisements viewed;
     * Information about your browser: including information about your
       browser type and language, and browser history;
     * Information about your device: including information about your IP
       address, device make, device model, device operating system, device
       operating system version, and data connection type; and
     * Information about your Internet service: including information
       about which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use.

   We do not collect any “sensitive” or “special categories of personal
   data” as defined under European data protection laws.

   How We Collect User Information

   We use cookies and other standard web technologies to collect
   information automatically from your device.  Please review our Platform
   Cookie Statement for further information.

   Other technologies: Additionally, we use other technologies, including
   local storage, to collect User Information in order to assist with the
   delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.

   In addition, we also work with third party advertising platforms that
   separately collect and use User Information to enable our and their
   customers to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising
   technology. As an example, we work with companies that use information
   about your visits to various websites or applications across multiple
   devices in order to provide you content and ads of interest across
   those devices. Our customers may use this third-party data in
   combination with your User Information to deliver you targeted ads
   across multiple devices.

   How We Use User Information

   We primarily use the User Information we collect to enable our clients
   to buy and sell advertising space on Digital Media Properties. In
   particular, our customers use information we provide, in conjunction
   with other information they have independently collected, to deliver
   end users targeted advertising they believe will be of particular
   interest to those users based on interests that might be inferred from
   the User Information that we collect. For more information about how
   targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising
   Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page
   at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/h
   ow-does-it-work.

   We may also use the User Information we collect for our legitimate
   business interests:
     * To operate and improve our technology;
     * To compile statistics and conduct research and development for our
       internal business purposes – all of which is done in aggregate
       without identifying you;
     * To enable standard advertising controls;
     * To prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;
     * To analyze and report on ad performance (such as tracking views of
       ad, as well as click-through rates on ads), campaign reporting, and
       campaign forecasting; and
     * To protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent,
       unauthorized, or illegal activity.

   Legal basis for Processing User Information (EEA and UK end users only)

   If you are an end user located in the European Economic Area or the
   United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the User
   Information described above will depend on the User Information
   concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

   However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect User
   Information from you, except where such interests are overridden by
   your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
   Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your User
   Information, they include the interests described in the section headed
   “How We Use User Information“.

   In some cases, we may rely on your consent or have a legal obligation
   to collect User Information from you or may otherwise need the User
   Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
   If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your User Information,
   we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.

   If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
   legal basis on which we collect and use your User Information, please
   contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us”
   heading below.

   Information Retention

   We never store any data longer than we think we need it. The cookies
   set out on your device expire no later than 366 days after they were
   last accessed.  We typically store the User Information we collect,
   such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90
   days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
   User Information we no longer need is deleted from either the cookies
   or our servers (as applicable).

   In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer
   periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law
   enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to
   corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial
   reporting legislation.

   Sharing of User Information

   We share User Information that we collect as follows:
     * Customer: We share User Information with our advertiser clients to
       help them identify and buy advertising on publishers’ Digital Media
       Properties. Clients may use this information in conjunction with
       other information they have independently collected to provide you
       targeted advertising and to help them evaluate whether a particular
       ad campaign may be of interest to you.
     * Rubicon Project Affiliates: We share User Information with other
       companies in The Rubicon Project group of companies to use for any
       of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
     * Business Transfers: We may share User Information in connection
       with the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or
       assets to a third party buyer.
     * Vital interest, legal rights and compliance with laws. We may share
       User Information with law enforcement, regulatory authorities,
       courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services or other
       necessary third parties for legal, protection, security, and safety
       purposes, including:
          + to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond
            to lawful requests and legal process;
          + to protect the rights and property of Rubicon Project, our
            agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our
            agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our
            network and physical assets; and/or
          + to protect the safety of our employees and agents, our
            customers, or any person.
     * Vendors, partners and other service providers: We may share User
       Information with our vendors and partners who perform functions on
       our or our clients’ behalf and require access to such information
       to provide us with services or do work for us. Examples include:
       analyzing data, fraud prevention, hosting data, engaging technical
       support for our technology platform, and performing analysis
       related to our technology platform and related services.

   Information Our Customers and Vendors Collect

   Our clients, our vendors, and our clients’ vendors, who use our
   technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar
   technology (or those of their other affiliates) within their
   advertisements and on certain websites. We are not responsible for our
   clients, vendors and/or our clients’ vendors use of such tracking
   technologies or for their privacy practices.

   Your Opt-Out Choices

   There are many ways to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising that
   our clients may conduct using our technology. Note that different
   devices use different identifiers and different technologies, so that
   you must opt out separately from each browser and each device that you
   would like to be opted out.  If you opt-out of targeted advertising, we
   will no longer collect User Information described above from your
   device.

   Display

   Should you wish to opt-out of the use of information about the websites
   you visit in order to deliver targeted advertising to you using our
   “display” technology, you can do so using the opt-out tool on our
   website,
   at http://rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-ou
   t/.

   Additionally, you can opt-out by using any of the following three
   mechanisms. First, because we are a member of the NAI and adhere to the
   NAI’s code of conduct and mobile code of conduct, you can opt-out of
   targeted advertising by participating companies, including Rubicon
   Project, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Second, because
   we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory
   Principles, you can visit the DAA’s opt-out page
   at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Third, for users located in the
   European Union, Rubicon Project also adheres to the Interactive
   Advertising Bureau of Europe’s Online Behavioral Advertising Framework.
   Accordingly, EU-based users can opt-out of targeted advertising through
   the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page
   at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.

   Please note that these opt-outs operate by placing a cookie on your
   device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt-out.
   They may not function properly if you have configured your browser to
   reject certain cookies. If you change browsers or computers, or delete
   the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again. You also
   can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to
   block most cookies, including ours.

   Mobile

   Your device may give you the ability to opt-out of the use of
   information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are
   targeted to your interests (“Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out
   of Ads Personalization” on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” on
   iOS devices). You may stop the collection of location information by
   particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing
   the preferences on your mobile device. For more information on how to
   change your preferences, please see
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.

   European Data Subject Rights

   If you are a resident of a country in the European Economic Area
   (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK“), you have certain rights and
   protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use
   of information about you.  As stated above, the information that we
   collect about you when you visit Digital Media Properties that use our
   advertising technology may include certain digital identifiers that are
   considered “personal data” under European law.

   As a resident of those countries, you have the right to: (i) to request
   access and obtain a copy of your User Information, (ii) to request
   rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your User
   Information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
   circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing
   of your User Information.

   If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our Data
   Subject Rights policy for instructions on how to do so:
   http://rubiconproject.com/terms-conditions/subject-access-request-polic
   y/. Please note that because most of the information we store can only
   identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you
   individually, you need to provide us with some additional information
   to enable us to identify the User Information we hold about you, if
   any, and ensure that we accurately fulfill your request.

   In addition, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications
   from Rubicon Project. If you would like to exercise this right, please
   write to us at the contact details provided below.

   Finally, as a resident of the EEA or UK, you have the right to lodge a
   complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data
   Protection Authority.  For contact details of your relevant local Data
   Protection Authority, please see here:
   http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-p
   rotection-authorities/index_en.htm.

   Security

   We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures
   to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems.
   Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however,
   can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all
   reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.

   Changes to this Policy

   We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
   example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or
   regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this policy, we will
   notify you of any material changes by posting the revised policy on
   this website, and where necessary, by any other means required by
   applicable law.

   Data Transfers for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)

   Rubicon Project is a global company headquartered in the United States
   with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.
   If you are accessing any of the Digital Media Properties from outside
   the United States, please be aware that your data may be transferred
   to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates in our facilities in
   the United States and other countries (including in Hong Kong, Brazil,
   Japan, Singapore and Australia, where our global affiliates have
   offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your User
   Information.

   These countries (including the United States) may not provide a level
   of data protection for your User Information that would be considered
   adequate as determined by the European Commission, or have data
   protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We
   will however ensure that where Rubicon Project group companies or third
   party service providers receive User Information outside of the EEA,
   appropriate protections are in place under European data protection
   legislation.

   In this regard, The Rubicon Project, Inc. and its US subsidiaries,
   Rubicon Project Hopper, Inc. and Rubicon Project Apex, Inc. have
   self-certified to the Privacy Shield (see below) to ensure that
   appropriate safeguards are in place when personal information is
   transferred outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland.

   If you would like to learn more about the safeguards we put in place
   for international transfers, please contact us using the contact
   details further below.

   Privacy Shield

   The Rubicon Project, Inc. and its US subsidiaries, Rubicon Project
   Hopper Inc. and Rubicon Project Apex, Inc., comply with the EU-US and
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of
   Commerce with respect to personal information concerning individuals
   from the EEA, the UK and Switzerland. Please see our Privacy Shield
   Notice to learn more.

   If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and
   the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall
   govern.
