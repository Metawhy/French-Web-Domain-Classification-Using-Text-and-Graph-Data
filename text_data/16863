Generation Z setting new standards for online safety

   September 30th 2019

   They’re drinking less, smoking less, and doing fewer drugs. Now,
   Generation Zs (adults aged 16-24) are claiming the crown as the most
   sensible online, according to research conducted for this year's Get
   Safe Online Week. The majority (88%) agree they are more digitally
   responsible because they grew up with technology at their fingertips
   (56%) and have learned from the mistakes of previous
   generations (30%).

      - Gen Zs (88%) believe they are the most digitally responsible
   generation

      - Most (92%) have some wisdom they would like to share

      - But they still have a lot to learn; 64% still don’t think it’s
   risky to share sexually explicit photos

      - More than three quarters (77%) of Gen Z have been left red-faced
   by something posted about them online

   A generation on better behaviour

   According to the survey of 2,056 UK adults, Gen Zs are the most likely
   to take some proactive measures to stay safe online. They are the most
   conscious of their online image and more wary of embarrassing others.
   This is perhaps because they are the most likely generation (77%) to
   have themselves been left red-faced by something posted about them
   online.

   More room to grow into digitally responsible adults

   However, these young adults are far from perfect. In fact, they are the
   least likely age group to use internet security software (25% compared
   to 47% among those aged 25+). Almost three quarters (71%) of Gen Zs
   also fail to carry out carry out software, operating system and app
   updates when prompted.

   They are the most liberal age group when it comes to sharing nude or
   sexually explicit photos/videos online. Two thirds (64%) of 16-24 year
   olds say it’s okay to share nudes if “it's done on a platform where the
   pictures can only be viewed once” (22%), “if you don’t show your face”
   (22%), or “if it’s with someone you trust” (34%). This ignores the fact
   that phones can be hacked and disappearing messages can be
   screenshotted. The least likely age group to share is those aged 55+,
   with 90% saying it’s never OK to share explicit content.

   Another hidden platform for reckless behaviour could be on dating apps.
   16-24-year olds are the most likely age group to let their guard down
   with strangers on dating apps or websites. Almost half (47%) say they
   are likely to do this (compared to just 20% of people aged 25+),
   exposing themselves to risks including romance fraud and sextortion.

   Sharing digital lessons with generation sensible

   Most (92%) of Gen Zs have something they would like to teach older
   generations to help them stay safe online. The top lessons they would
   share are:

   -  How to spot spam/scam emails (46%)

   -  How to not fall for phone scams (44%)

   -  How to make sure their social media profile is set to private (31%)

   -  The impact of oversharing on social media (29%)

   -  How to create a strong password (26%)

   The majority (79%) of UK adults also have lessons they would like to
   pass on to younger people. Making sure they understand the dangers
   of sharing sexually explicit photos online is their top
   priority (48%).

   Tony Neate, CEO, Get Safe Online, comments: “In many ways Gen Zs are
   more digitally savvy and we have a lot to learn from them. But young
   adults will continue to make mistakes online just as they will in real
   life. It's all a part of growing up. Digital responsibility must always
   be a two-way conversation to keep improving behaviours and ensure a
   safer use of the internet.”

John and Sarah are most likely to overshare online

   October 1st 2019

   ‘John’ and ‘Sarah’ are the names of people most likely to
   overshare online. A poll of 2,056 UK adults – commissioned for Get Safe
   Online Week – reveals the top male and female names most likely to give
   too much away on social media:


   Help, don't 'hide’, the oversharers

   Nearly half (47%) of people have either ‘hidden’ or 'muted' a relative
   because they can’t deal with their life
   updates. People feel particularly offended by too many posts (44%),
   misleading pictures (36%), selfies (29%), cryptic status updates (27%),
   hashtags (21%) and people checking themselves in at airports (21%).

   When asked who in their social networks they would most like
   to educate to be more digitally responsible online, 15% of people
   said a friend. This was followed by their mum (13%) and a
   sibling (11%).

   Tony Neate, CEO, Get Safe Online, comments: “We've all got a friend or
   relative who shares too much information. But oversharing online is
   more than just a bit annoying. Images could surface years later causing
   potential harm. Or cybercriminals could piece information
   together to commit identity fraud. We need to make sure those in our
   wider network understand how they could be putting themselves, their
   family, their friends, their finances and their identity at risk. So,
   if you spot someone close to you oversharing, don't just mute
   them. Give them some tips on how they can share more responsibly."

Scam warning after Thomas Cook collapse

   September 23rd 2019

   The collapse of travel group Thomas Cook has brought major concerns for
   its 150,000 customers currently on holiday abroad, and thousands of
   other people with future bookings. 22,000 jobs, including 9,000 in the
   UK, are also at risk, as are the investments of the group’s many
   shareholders.

   However, today Get Safe Online is warning that it will spark a rash of
   scams, perpetrated by fraudsters exploiting the 178- year-old firm’s
   compulsory liquidation. Typically of such situations, you may receive
   emails, texts, phone calls or messages/posts on social media claiming
   to be either from the Official Receiver, Thomas Cook itself or a legal
   firm, offering refunds and/or compensation. These may request details
   of your bank account or ask you to click on a link. Alternatively, they
   could request an upfront payment as a fee for handling compensation
   claims.

   Such communications could be received whether you are a Thomas Cook
   customer or not, with the fraudsters relying on hitting some genuine
   customers amongst the thousands of people they target randomly.
   Shareholders may also be targeted by such scams.

   Only Thomas Cook customers who are currently abroad – or who have
   booked future holidays or travel – will receive genuine communications
   from either the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) or one of the two firms
   appointed as Special Managers in respect of various group companies:
   AlixPartners UK LLP or KPMG LLP. If you do receive an online or
   telephone communication from any of these organisations, you can always
   communicate with them direct to ensure they are authentic.

   For any creditor queries please contact  [email protected]

   For shareholder queries please contact [email protected]

Barclays warns students about money mule recruitment

   September 19th 2019

   Barclays issues warning to university students, as number of under-21s
   recruited as money mules nearly doubles

       -  New data from Barclays reveals that under-21s being recruited as
   money mules increased by 97% between 2016 and 2018

       -  Nearly three quarters of university students don't realise they
   could face jail time for acting as a money mule

       -  With many victims being tricked into becoming money mules
   unwittingly, Barclays warns students heading back to university to be
   extra vigilant and aware of the risks

   As students go to university or college for the first time - or return
   to their studies - Barclays has issued new figures indicating that the
   number of under-21s being recruited by criminals to launder money has
   nearly doubled in the past two years. University students are being
   actively targeted by criminals as they start the new academic year.

   Whilst the overall number of mules is falling, cash-strapped students
   are becoming lucrative new targets for fraudsters – with the data
   highlighting that almost a third (30%) of all money mules reported to
   Barclays last year were under the age of 21.

   Most victims become money mules unknowingly, as savvy criminals take
   advantage of university students’ financial worries. Research reveals
   six in 10 (61%) worry about their financial situation on a weekly
   basis, which is leaving students vulnerable to some of the common
   techniques used by fraudsters.

   Using channels such as social media and messaging services, students
   are being lured into laundering dirty cash with fake job adverts
   offering easy money.

   Six in 10 (57%) would be tempted to find out more about a ‘too good to
   be true’ job advert that offered ‘easy money with no experience’, and
   half (50%) would be interested in an offer of ‘free money from the
   comfort of your own home’.

   It is the lack of understanding of the risks involved that is making
   students increasingly vulnerable. Seven in 10 (74%) admit to not being
   aware of the consequences of being caught laundering money, which could
   include a lengthy prison sentence, and half (50%) do not even know what
   a money mule is.

   To help keep young people safe as they head back to university this
   autumn, Barclays is offering advice to avoid falling victim to this
   fast-growing scam:

   -  Keep control. Don’t give away any of your bank account details,
   unless you know and trust the person receiving them – and never let
   anyone else access your account. Alarmingly, nearly one in seven (14%)
   students have shared their PIN with someone else

   -  Money for nothing? Be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money
   as this is a common tactic used by criminals to recruit money mules

   - Tell someone you trust. Whether it’s a parent, tutor or friend, make
   sure you tell someone you trust about any concerns you might have

   - Take time to think. Remember that letting someone else use your bank
   account is a potentially serious crime which could damage your
   financial future – is it worth it?

   - Too good to be true? Remember the simple rule of thumb about offers
   of easy money: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is

   Ross Martin, Head of Digital Safety at Barclays, said: “We know
   criminal gangs are ruthlessly targeting cash-strapped students on
   campuses across the UK, with the aim of tricking them into laundering
   their dirty money. Worryingly, we’ve seen a sharp increase in the
   number of student money mules who unwittingly allow criminals to access
   their bank accounts, unaware that the money flowing in and out is often
   connected to serious crime.

   “It is vital that all students are aware of the risks and can spot the
   warning signs when they think they are in danger. Providing young
   people with the necessary tools and knowledge can help prevent
   criminals from taking advantage of students in vulnerable financial
   situations.”
