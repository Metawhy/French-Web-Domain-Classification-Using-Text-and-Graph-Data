Email Tracking Eliminates Guesswork

    1. hubspot-sales-email-notifications

Know the second a prospect becomes a lead.
       With email tracking, you get a desktop notification the second a
       prospect opens your email and clicks a link inside.
       Take the time to personalize your outreach after a lead engages
       with your emails, and continue to automate outreach to prospects
       who don’t.
       You’ll spend less time chasing cold prospects and more time closing
       warm leads.
    2. hubspot-sales-timely-follow-up

Get your emails opened and calls answered.
       You can make sure to follow up with leads when you’re already top
       of mind.
       Use notifications to follow up seconds after a lead opens an email,
       clicks a link, or downloads an important document such as a
       proposal.
       When you reach out at the right time, you can expect more email
       opens, answered calls, booked meetings, and sales.
    3. emailtracking3

See a lead’s entire history at a glance.
       Stop wondering if a lead “got your email” or if they found it
       interesting.
       A built-in activity stream automatically logs each lead’s history
       inside your browser or HubSpot Sales.
       You can see which emails, links, and documents were opened and
       when, then personalize your approach to get the sale.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365.

   You can also send tracked emails directly within HubSpot CRM. Then
   control when and how you receive notifications: in HubSpot Sales, your
   browser, on your desktop, or in your CRM.

   email more than once.

   Works with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or Office 365 for Windows

Spend more time selling and less time drafting repetitive emails.

    1. HubSpot Sales - Email Templates

Send template emails from inside your inbox.
       Access a library of built-in templates designed for every step of
       your customer’s journey, or create your own from scratch.
       And your templates are always one click away inside your inbox –
       whether you use Outlook or Office 365 for Windows, or Gmail.
       You’ll save hours when you can send your most repetitive emails in
       seconds.
    2. HubSpot Sales - See which email templates work, and which don't

Optimize email templates with real-time metrics.
       Real-time metrics show you which of your templates are performing,
       and which ones need attention now.
       Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and
       customers can’t help but click. And your click rates tell you which
       buttons, links, and attachments they explore.
       You can see metrics across all of your templates, for an individual
       sales rep, and over any time period – it’s all there in your
       dashboard.
    3. HubSpot Sales - Share your best templates with your whole team.

Share your best templates with your whole team.
       Close more deals by sharing your best email templates with your
       entire team.
       See which email templates are sent, opened, and engaged with the
       most to uncover your time-saving and high-performing templates.
       Then give your team access to these templates inside of their
       inboxes. Now everyone has the best email for any situation at their
       fingertips.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365 for Windows.

   Access all of your email templates from inside your inbox, personalize
   them in seconds, then hit send. Now you’re sending more and better
   emails in a fraction of the time.

       and calls-to-action.

Email Tracking Eliminates Guesswork

    1. hubspot-sales-email-notifications

Know the second a prospect becomes a lead.
       With email tracking, you get a desktop notification the second a
       prospect opens your email and clicks a link inside.
       Take the time to personalize your outreach after a lead engages
       with your emails, and continue to automate outreach to prospects
       who don’t.
       You’ll spend less time chasing cold prospects and more time closing
       warm leads.
    2. hubspot-sales-timely-follow-up

Get your emails opened and calls answered.
       You can make sure to follow up with leads when you’re already top
       of mind.
       Use notifications to follow up seconds after a lead opens an email,
       clicks a link, or downloads an important document such as a
       proposal.
       When you reach out at the right time, you can expect more email
       opens, answered calls, booked meetings, and sales.
    3. emailtracking3

See a lead’s entire history at a glance.
       Stop wondering if a lead “got your email” or if they found it
       interesting.
       A built-in activity stream automatically logs each lead’s history
       inside your browser or HubSpot Sales.
       You can see which emails, links, and documents were opened and
       when, then personalize your approach to get the sale.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365.

   You can also send tracked emails directly within HubSpot CRM. Then
   control when and how you receive notifications: in HubSpot Sales, your
   browser, on your desktop, or in your CRM.

   email more than once.
   Get started free

   Works with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or Office 365 for Windows

Spend more time selling and less time drafting repetitive emails.

    1. HubSpot Sales - Email Templates

Send template emails from inside your inbox.
       Access a library of built-in templates designed for every step of
       your customer’s journey, or create your own from scratch.
       And your templates are always one click away inside your inbox –
       whether you use Outlook or Office 365 for Windows, or Gmail.
       You’ll save hours when you can send your most repetitive emails in
       seconds.
    2. HubSpot Sales - See which email templates work, and which don't

Optimize email templates with real-time metrics.
       Real-time metrics show you which of your templates are performing,
       and which ones need attention now.
       Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and
       customers can’t help but click. And your click rates tell you which
       buttons, links, and attachments they explore.
       You can see metrics across all of your templates, for an individual
       sales rep, and over any time period – it’s all there in your
       dashboard.
    3. HubSpot Sales - Share your best templates with your whole team.

Share your best templates with your whole team.
       Close more deals by sharing your best email templates with your
       entire team.
       See which email templates are sent, opened, and engaged with the
       most to uncover your time-saving and high-performing templates.
       Then give your team access to these templates inside of their
       inboxes. Now everyone has the best email for any situation at their
       fingertips.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365 for Windows.

   Access all of your email templates from inside your inbox, personalize
   them in seconds, then hit send. Now you’re sending more and better
   emails in a fraction of the time.

       with HubSpot's meetings tool is convenient (and headache-free) for
       all.
    3. sales-meetings-4.png

Grow your database as you schedule meetings.
       Scheduling meetings means you’re also organizing and growing your
       database over time.
       As prospects schedule meetings, HubSpot automatically creates
       records for new people.
       Powerful alone, but even better together.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot CRM works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or Office
   365 for Windows.

   Connect with your Google Calendar or Office 365 Calendar to
   automatically sync availability, and put the power to book meetings in
   the hands of your prospects.

Focus on the right deals and hit your quota.

    1. hubspot-crm-add-a-deal

Create new deals in no time.
       Create new deals at breakneck speed.
       When you add new deals from a contact or company record, HubSpot
       CRM saves you time by populating most of the deal’s record
       automatically with the most up-to-date information.
       You’ll stop wasting time on manual data entry so you can send more
       emails, make more phone calls, and hit your quota.
    2. hubspot-crm-edit-deal-stages

Customize your pipeline to match your sales process.
       Whether you have an established sales process or you’re starting
       from scratch, HubSpot CRM makes it easy to create your ideal
       process.
       Add, edit, and delete deal stages and properties without help from
       IT, and push deals forward by assigning tasks to your team. Then
       drag and drop deals between stages when they’re successful.
       When you take control of your pipeline, you can focus on the deals
       that matter.
    3.

Track progress and diagnose the health of your pipeline.
       Get total visibility into individual and team performance.
       Use your sales dashboard to check on progress toward sales quotas,
       monthly trends in key sales activities, and the overall value and
       health of your pipeline.
       By identifying where in your pipeline potential revenue is piling
       up, you can rally your team around the right deals.
