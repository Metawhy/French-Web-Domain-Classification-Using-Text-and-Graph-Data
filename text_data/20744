   The MozBar has been a critical part of my link building strategies and
   competitive analysis for 5 years now, through agency work and in house
   SEO. It's the tool that gets the most excited responses when you share
   it with your clients: it's easy to use, easy to understand, and adds an
   extra layer of information to every website you visit. Definitely a
   must have for any SEO.
   Michael Cottam

Michael Cottam

President at OzTech, Inc

   I use the MozBar all day long, every day, on every project. The SERP
   overlay gives instant, critical information on the competitiveness of
   any given query, and the domain and page stats give a valuable snapshot
   of the link juice 'big picture'. And, the new spam score tells me if
   trouble's brewing as a result of past SEO efforts ... even if the
   client is unaware of or not admitting to iffy link-building activity in
   their past. When I'm doing on-page analysis, the core elements (page
   title, meta description, H1, rel canonical, meta robots, etc.) are
   right at my fingertips without needing to do a View Source or kick off
   my crawler.

   could ever want. On-page elements, HTTP status codes, link metrics,
   schema markup, keyword difficulty ... it's all only 2 clicks away!

   getting better. Stop wasting your time, download MozBar!
