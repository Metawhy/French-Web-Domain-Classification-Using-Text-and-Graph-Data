   Tales of the Black Freighter is a classic comic book magazine within
   the Watchmen universe. Its covers of discarded issues are seen all
   around the background. It includes the title Marooned, which is
   partially seen by Bernie, a teenage boy who reads it.

Premise [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Tales is one of the many pirate/swashbuckling-themed comic books. The
   magazine was published by National Comics and was created by new writer
   Max Shea and star pirate artist Joe Orlando, who was later replaced by
   Walt Feinberg.

   Shying away from mainstream adventures, its radical and innovative
   stories show a disturbing reality against metaphysical terrors and
   perverse comments on the human condition. They narrate the dark and
   sinister tales of the Black Freighter (named after a song in the
   Threepenny Opera). It is a hellish phantom ship that collects souls of
   evil men to serve its bloodstained decks, captained by a mysterious,
   demonic figure that is also perhaps an undead sailor.

History [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   It was first published May 1960 and the first 6 issues included the
   back-up feature Galapagos Jones (which was not drawn by Orlando).
   Although it never topped the critically acclaimed Piracy and Buccaneers
   by E.C., it made a lasting impression and its early success was thanks
   to Orlando's majestic artwork.

   The first nine issues were drawn by Orlando until friction with Shea
   forced him to leave. Starting from issue #10, the remaining issues were
   drawn by Walt Feinberg and saw Shea's developing writing skill.

   The comic was cancelled after issue 31 and the departure of Max Shea
   but the classical stories had a lasting impact, as they were
   rediscovered and reexamined. Many were attracted by the controversy
   surrounding the last issues. They are mint priced for a thousand of
   dollars according to Overstreet Guide. The classical first 30 issues
   are reprinted successfully by DC comics in 1984 and 85.^[1]

Known issues [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

     * 1: Published in May 1960, it has the frame story of 3 sailors of
       different origins who meet in an abandoned tavern and narrate how
       they got there. Each narration is a tale of treachery with a plot
       twist; the first tale includes a fight between 2 ghouls with
       shovels in the tunnels under a churchyard. At the end, a captain
       who spies on him silently tels them they are worthy to be hired on
       his ship. They eagerly board and realize their horrible fate on the
       Black Freighter, which sails away in the white mist. The story is
       described as sturdy but cliched and predictable, compared to Shea's
       later stories.
     * 3: Between Breaths: A man is drowning, his viewpoint alternating
       between flash-backs of his previous life and the experience of
       drowning, with horrific descriptions that create a suffocating
       effect. The story ends with undead walking on the ocean bed and
       climbing the anchor rope of the Black Freighter.
     * 6: Last issue featuring Galapagos Jones
     * 7: The Shanty of Edward Teach: The most famous collaboration
       between Shea and Orlando, it has the undead Blackbeard reminiscing
       his life in rhyme. The story ends with a memorable close-up of
       Blackbeard directed to the audience saying that the world of the
       living is no better than his. This issue introduces the dark and
       pessimistic moral sensibilities of Shea.
     * 9: Last issue drawn by Orlando.
     * 10: First issue drawn by Feinberg.
     * ??: The Figurehead: Deals with male homosexuality
     * 23-24: Marooned: A harrowing one-character tale narrated mainly in
       captions. It chronicles a castaway's increasingly desperate
       attempts to return home to warn his family of the impending arrival
       of the Black Freighter. To escape the deserted island he uses the
       gas-bloated bodies of his former crewmates to float a raft, fending
       off sharks en route; to infiltrate the (supposedly)
       pirate-controlled Davidstown, he murders a trusting couple and
       returns dressed in the man's clothing; to save his family he
       attacks a night watchman who is patrolling the house. However, this
       watchman is actually his wife, and he soon realizes that there has
       been no attack and his efforts have only brought about his own
       destruction. The man returns to the beach to see the Black
       Freighter approaching, ready to claim the only life it truly
       desired - his. He boards eagerly.
     * 25: Beginning of a controversial run of issues. They have to do
       with plundered books (including forbidden tomes headed for the
       vaults of the Vatican) in the library of the Black Freighter. Four
       of the five projected issues were rejected, described as 'blatantly
       pornographic'.
     * 31: Final issue.

Production background [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   A pirate comic book was conceived by Moore because he and Gibbons
   thought that since the inhabitants of the Watchmen universe experience
   superheroes in real life, "they probably wouldn't be at all interested
   in superhero comics." Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore
   agreed because he is "a big Brecht fan": the Black Freighter alludes to
   the song "Seeräuberjenny" from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. The real-life
   artist Joe Orlando is credited in Watchmen as a major contributor to
   Tales of the Black Freighter.

Animated adaptation [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Tales of the Black Freighter was adapted as a direct-to-video animated
   feature from Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation, released on
   March 24, 2009 as a tie-in to the Watchmen movie.^[2] It was originally
   included in the Watchmen script,^[3] but was changed from live-action
   footage to animation because of the $20 million it would have cost to
   film it in the stylized manner of 300 that Zack Snyder wanted;^[2] this
   animated version, originally intended to be included in the final
   cut,^[4] was then cut because the film was already approaching a
   three-hour running time.^[2] Gerard Butler, who starred in 300, voices
   the Captain in the animated feature, having been promised a role in the
   live-action film that never materialized.^[5] Jared Harris voices
   Ridley. Snyder had Butler and Harris record their parts together.^[6]
   The Ultimate Edition has a cut with the Tales of the Black Freighter
   scenes woven in.

   The Tales of the Black Freighter DVD also includes a documentary named
   Under the Hood.

   Doomsday Clock

   Doomsday Clock is a twelve-issue comic book series written by Geoff
   Johns and illustrated by Gary Frank. It began on November 21st 2017, at
   three minutes to midnight. It is the sequel to Watchmen, written by
   Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons.

Background [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   In 1985, Alan Moore stated that he and Dave Gibbons had discussed doing
   a prequel series to Watchmen entitled Minutemen, based around the team
   of the same name, if the original proved successful. While Dave Gibbons
   remained open to the possibility, Alan Moore ultimately declined. Other
   proposed spin-offs and prequels were vetoed equally adamantly by Moore,
   who believed Watchmen should remain a standalone story. The dispute
   over the rights to Watchmen between Moore and DC Comics ultimately
   meant that any future material produced from Watchmen as a franchise
   would be done without the original creator.

   Meanwhile, the comic book industry underwent what is often referred to
   as "The Dark Age of Comic Books", during which large crops of stories
   inspired by the success of Watchmen and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight
   Returns emerged. However, attempting to emulate their more mature
   themes and styles produced less than spectacular results, and overtime
   public opinion of comics as a medium dwindled as a result. This period
   ended with the crash of the comic book industry in 1996, when the
   market became oversaturated by countless copies of unappealing
   material, and the industry temporarily collapsed.

   In 2010, DC Comics offered the rights to Watchmen back to Alan Moore
   and Dave Gibbons in exchange for his cooperation in expanding Watchmen
   into a larger universe. Moore vehemently declined any continuation of
   Watchmen in any capacity, while Gibbons expressed his support at new
   creators getting to work on the property, leading to the publication of
   the Before Watchmen line of comics in 2012. Written by teams of
   different writers and creators, the line was met with a mixed response.

   After several years of disappointing sales due to the failure of The
   New 52 and DC YOU Initiatives, DC decided to return to its roots with
   DC Rebirth, which introduced Watchmen to the broader DC Universe by
   hinting at Doctor Manhattan's involvement in the restructuring of time
   and space which followed DC's Flashpoint event. Rebirth proved a
   runaway success. Following the United States Presidential Election and
   a number of other events in late 2016, Geoff Johns, CCO and President
   of DC Comics, finalized the story for a sequel to Watchmen and the
   conclusion of the DC Rebirth initiative: Doomsday Clock.

   Doomsday Clock #1: That Annihilated Place

Issue 1: "That Annihilated Place" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D]
Edit

   The series opens on November 22nd, 1992, seven years after the
   conclusion of Watchmen. The world is in chaos as the full extent of
   Ozymandias' plan is revealed to the public after several years of
   investigation following the publication of Rorschach's Journal in The
   New Frontiersman. A global manhunt is underway for Adrian Veidt, while
   relations between the United States of America and the Russian
   Federation are at their lowest ebb over the revelations, with each
   suspecting the other of conspiring with him. Protesters assemble
   outside the main building of Veidt Enterprises, and a riot breaks out.
   The police are unable to prevent the protesters from ransacking the
   building, where they find Ozymandias has fled.

   Meanwhile, Russian special forces breach Karnak, and find the facility
   empty. All of Ozymandias' video monitors are tuned to different cable
   news channels, revealing that all independent news networks in the
   United States are going offline and a new National News Network will be
   coming online at 6:00. One journalist, Howard Beale of the Union
   Broadcasting Service, demands the people rise up before the network is
   shut down. During the period of silence which follows, the Russians
   discover a medical bay, with x-rays of Ozymandias' skull showing a
   large cancerous mass. The National News Network comes online, anchored
   by William F. Buckley Jr., who says that the Russians have invaded
   Poland. President Robert Redford has given them four hours to withdraw
   their troops or the United States will launch a full retaliatory
   strike. Mandatory evacuations orders are issued for all major U.S
   cities.

   At Sing Sing Prison in New York, the guards are evacuating and refusing
   to let the prisoners go. One prisoner is able to grab one of the guards
   and demand his release. The prisoner is horrified when the guard is
   knocked unconscious by Rorschach, who grabs the guard's keyring and
   asks the prisoner if he still wants to be let out, which the prisoner
   fearfully declines. Rorschach keeps the keys and moves on, locating the
   cell is he looking for. He confronts the occupant of the cell, a
   criminal known as Marionette, who reacts with terror when she sees him.
   He says he's come to recruit her for a job, but she refuses to leave,
   claiming that the last time she met Rorschach he threatened to drop her
   down an elevator shaft if they ever met again. Rorschach claims he is
   not Walter Kovacs, and is forced to pull off his glove to prove it,
   revealing he is African-American. He incentivizes the still reluctant
   Marionette with a photograph of her missing son, promising a reunion if
   she complies. She is adamant, however, that they rescue her husband
   Mime before leaving, which Rorschach reluctantly agrees to.

   They leave the prison and head for New York City, making a quick exit
   into the sewers, finding their way to Nite Owl's base. When they
   arrive, however, it is not Nite Owl waiting for them but Ozymandias.
   With two hours left before nuclear war begins, Ozymandias reveals the
   job is to find Doctor Manhattan and return him to Earth so that he can
   stop this.

   In Metropolis, Superman has a nightmare of the night his parents died
   in a car crash when he was young. He wakes up screaming and unwittingly
   floats off the bed in a panic before being calmed by his wife, Lois.
   She says she can't remember the last time he had a nightmare, and he
   reveals that until now, he never has.

     "He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess
     What powerful but unrecorded race
     Once dwelt in that annihilated place."

     —"Ozymandias" (Horace Smith)

Issue 2: "Places We Have Never Known"

   Issue #2: Places We Have Never Known

   Mime and Marionette reapply their costumes while Rorschach and
   Ozymandias review footage of their final heist. When the duo attempted
   to rob a government bank, Doctor Manhattan intervened, and a standoff
   between he and Mime ensued. Just as Doctor Manhattan was about to
   disintegrate Mime, Marionette through herself in the way, demanding she
   die first if he was going to go through with it. Manhattan, seemingly
   sensing that she was pregnant, relented and retreated as the
   authorities arrived. Ozymandias wishes to use that moment to remind
   Manhattan of his inherent humanity and leverage his assistance. The
   footage blinks out as nuclear war erupts. The group follows a trail of
   electrons left by Manhattan aboard the Owlship, using quantum tunneling
   to narrowly escape the destruction of New York City.

   In Gotham City, Bruce Wayne is undergoing psychological examinations at
   the request of Wayne Enterprises Board of Directors, who want
   assurances that he is healthy and fit to lead the company. Wayne
   Enterprises is currently embroiled in a heated game of corporate
   warfare with LexCorp. over the Metagene, a part of human DNA which is
   believed to be the catalyst for superhuman abilities. Its secrets have
   become both coveted and controversial as a Markovian scientist, Dr.
   Helga Jace, has recently stirred international tensions by proposing
   what she calls "The Supermen Theory", which accuses the United States
   Government of manufacturing both superheroes and supervillains to
   maintain the global dominance and cultural hegemony they have enjoyed
   since the end of World War II. Accusations have been leveled at
   superhero Metamorpho, as well as supervillain Man-Bat, whose origins
   have newly leaked government connections, though their credibility is
   questionable. Protestors are now demanding Batman publicly unmask, as
   he has always been one of the most unaccountable vigilantes. Only
   Superman himself has been considered above suspicion, as his origins
   are well-documented and his actions speak for themselves. The theory
   frightens the Russian Federation, who ally themselves with Markovia
   amidst fears of a superhuman arms race. The Doomsday Clock is set to
   three minutes to midnight as global tensions rise.

   Wayne meets with Lucius Fox, head of R&D, and manufacturer for the
   equipment utilized by Batman. He expresses his concerns that the board
   may sell the company to LexCorp. if Wayne is not deemed fit to run the
   company, which would place not only the Metagene research firmly in the
   hands of Lex Luthor, but also expose Batman to the public. Bruce
   dismisses his concerns and continues his war on crime.

   The Owlship crashes at an abandoned amusement park elsewhere in Gotham,
   rendering the crew unconscious. Ozymandias is the first to awaken, and
   rouses Rorschach, who at first forgets the agreement forged between the
   two to find Doctor Manhattan and tries to kill him. He is quickly
   returned to his senses and assists Veidt in securing Mime and
   Marionette, who they determine to be too big a risk to allow to roam
   free. They leave to gather information on where they have landed,
   passing by a television in an electronics store playing a marathon of
   Nathaniel Dusk films. They research the world at a nearby library,
   familiarizing themselves with history and current events. Noticing some
   of the heroes present were fictional characters in their world, they
   hypothesize that Manhattan may have created them, and might even be
   hiding among them. They also recognize Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne as
   the two most prominent and intelligent men on the planet, meaning they
   represent the best opportunity to find Manhattan. Veidt goes to seek
   the aid of Luthor, while Rorschach goes after Wayne. Mine and
   Marionette escape their confinements to get a drink in the city.

   In Wayne Manor, Rorschach finds a plate of pancakes prepared by Wayne's
   faithful butler Alfred, which he eats with pleasure. Doing so
   inadvertently leads Rorschach to discover a draft pulling through the
   room, leading to a clock on the far end of the room. Pulling it aside,
   he descends a staircase and discovers the Batcave, tripping a silent
   alarm and summoning Batman in the process, having just defeated Mad
   Hatter and his minions, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

   At LexCorp. Luthor's research on the Metagene is slow-going and
   providing little in the way of results. He is rapidly hiring and firing
   staff for failing to meet his expectations. Luthor has been
   perpetuating the Supermen Theory to further his own vendetta against
   superhumans and Superman in particular. He finds Veidt waiting in his
   office, admiring a painting on his wall, who suggests they share
   ambitions and insists them to be the two smartest men from their
   respective worlds. A bemused Luthor decides to humor him until security
   arrives, and while he does appear to believe the story, he also does
   not consider it his problem. At that moment, Ozymandias senses movement

   through the air. It strikes Luthor in the chest, incapacitating him.
   Turning to face his attacker, Ozymandias is shocked to see Edward
   Blake, The Comedian, returned from death and eager to take his revenge.

   DC- DC-

   A flashback reveals that Blake was seemingly saved in the middle of his
   fateful fall from his apartment window, seemingly disappearing just
   before he hit the ground. Blake instead lands in the ocean outside
   Gotham and swims to shore, where Doctor Manhattan greets him, dropping
   The Button in the sand as the Comedian demands to know where they are
   and what they're doing there.

   Ozymandias and the Comedian battle it out in Lex's office. The
   Comedian, sober, clearly gains an upper advantage on the cancer ridden
   Veidt. Veidt is saved from sharing Blake's initial fate when he is
   thrown against the window, only for the reinforced glass to refuse to
   break. Realizing he is outmatched, Ozymandias turns off the lights,
   shatters the window, and uses his acrobatic skills to leap from the
   rooftop safely. However, his new perch gives way and he falls to the
   ground, injured but alive. The Comedian disappears while Veidt and
   Luthor are hospitalized for their injuries.

   In a retirement community, senior citizens bicker over the control of
   the television, with one lamenting the loss of real heroes like
   Theodore Roosevelt and Sgt. Rock, and declaring that the only one left
   who they can trust is Superman. Johnny Thunder, the last survivor of
   the Justice Society of America, is seen looking out onto the rainy
   street waiting for someone he says never comes.

   Mime and Marionette make their way to a bar near the amusement park,
   analyzing the situation they've found themselves in. When they walk in,
   they are greeted by a number of thugs, who take offense to their attire
   as this territory belongs to the Joker. When one of them threatens
   Marionette because she does not know who that is, Mime reveals that the
   items he has been miming are real, but invisible to the human eye. His
   guns become visible when he kills the thug. He and Marionette slaughter
   the rest before getting a drink and deciding to go find the man the
   thugs called Joker.

   Rorschach is confronted by Batman, who demands that he leaves.
   Rorschach tries to explain the situation before deciding to simply hand
   him Kovacs's journal and let him read the details for himself. Batman,
   having had a long day already, takes his time and offers Rorschach a
   place to rest and clean up. He accepts, though he is uncomfortable with
   the luxuries he's offered. While in the shower, blood runs down his
   face as he violently tries to scrub himself clean, and he later suffers
   a nightmare of the New York City Massacre. He is roused by Batman, who
   reveals that he has completed the journal and claims to have found
   Doctor Manhattan in Arkham Asylum. The two breach the facility
   together, where they trace Manhattan's signature to the Mad Hatter's
   empty cell. Rorschach enters believing Manhattan to be inside, only for
   Batman to lock the cell. He apologizes and departs, with Rorschach
   threatening, begging, and screaming to be let out of the cell.

     "For better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs,
     even though checkered by failure...than to rank with those poor
     spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in a
     gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."

Issue 4: "Walk on Water" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   A series of flashbacks reveal the identity of Rorschach II as Reggie
   Long, son of the late Dr. Malcolm Long. He was at university when his
   father took on Walter Kovacs as a patient, was unaware of the effect
   that Kovacs was having on his father, whose condition is kept secret by
   his mother. When war between the United States and the Soviet Union
   seemed imminent, Reggie drove down to New York City to evacuate his
   parents. A car crash on the way into the city spares Reggie from the
   New York City Massacre, though he is driven nearly insane by the
   incident, and is committed to a mental hospital. The treatment proves
   fruitless, and one night Reggie escapes to commit suicide by throwing
   itself off the rooftop. However, when he reaches the roof, he
   encounters a naked man standing on the corner. When he asks him if he
   is going to jump, the man replies saying he's going to fly. As security
   closes in, Reggie is stunned when the man flies away on a pair of
   makeshift wings.

   The next day, Reggie meets the man again, and he identifies himself as
   Byron Lewis, the former Mothman. He makes frequent escapes and is
   always recaptured, each time smuggling contraband into the asylum. The
   two quickly become friends and learning of Reggie's background, Byron
   delivers a package of his father's belongings, the initial report on
   Kovacs among them. The rest of the reports are implied to have been
   destroyed by Byron. When a sadistic orderly breaks his father's mug,
   Reggie is taught by Byron how to fight, teaching him the skills of the
   Minutemen. At the same time, Reggie develops an admiration for
   Rorschach.

   As evidence mounts against Adrian Veidt, implicating him in the
   destruction of New York City, Reggie plots to take revenge on him. He
   and Byron escape, burning down the asylum and fleeing. However as they
   leave, Byron hallucinates, and walks into the fire and dies. He leaves
   behind a bag containing food, water, a ticket to the Arctic, a map to
   Karnak, and Rorschach's mask. He dons it to confront Veidt. When they
   meet, Reggie is surprised to find Veidt remorseful over his actions as
   he confronts his own mortality. Reggie agrees, reluctantly, to set
   aside his grudge and work with Veidt to save the world.

   In the present day, Reggie is detained in Arkham Asylum as a 'John
   Doe'. He quickly gets into violent confrontations between guards and
   prisoners alike. Reggie is interviewed by Dr. Matthew Mason about his
   identity and his background, but Reggie says nothing. As Reggie plans
   his escape, he is suddenly aided by a 'Jane Doe', in reality the
   time-displaced Saturn Girl, and the two flee Arkham together.
   Unbeknownst to them, they are being monitored by both Batman, who
   believed Reggie's story but knew him to be unstable, and seemingly
   Doctor Manhattan himself.

Issue 5: "There is No God" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Adrian is in hospital following his battle with the Comedian. Sedated,
   he is examined by a doctor, who finds it remarkable that he sustained
   so little injuries from the fall. She states he should be sedated for a
   couple more hours, during which time the police intend to turn him over
   to federal authorities. He awakens mere minutes later, overpowers the
   police, recovers his personal effects, and flees. He returns to the
   Owlship, discovering that Mime and Marionette are missing, and Batman
   waiting for him in the cockpit. Batman informs him that Rorschach is
   off the grid and then demands to know what Ozymandias really wants with
   their world, not believing his claims of altruism. The police surround
   the Owlship and they are forced to take off. In flight while evading
   police pursuers, Ozymandias realizes that Batman is blaming him for the
   ongoing chaos around the world, and the two engage in a heated debate
   about the role of heroes in the world. When Ozymandias begins to use
   lethal force against their pursuers, Batman struggles with him for the
   controls. The craft spirals out of control and Batman is thrown from
   the craft into a massive crowd of anti-vigilante protesters below, who
   quickly turn violent and beat Batman senseless as he struggles to
   escape, unwilling to fight back against innocent people.

   An international incident occurs in Russia, where American superheroes
   Hawk and Dove were arrested following a botched attempt to apprehend
   Chechen separatists responsible for a terrorist attack in St.
   Petersburg. They came into conflict with the Rocket Red Brigade, a
   metahuman Russian military unit, and were promptly detained amidst
   heightened tensions over the Supermen Theory. Superhero Pozhar
   announces the Russian Federation is closing its borders to all
   foreigners. The Russian President then unveils the People's Heroes, a
   team of government-employed Russian superheroes including Pozhar, and
   announces to the world that no one should underestimate the Russian
   Federation. Similar actions are taken by the governments of Britain,
   France, Israel, India, and China as nuclear weapons are supplanted
   worldwide in favor of metahuman armies. Adding to the tensions, Black
   Adam, leader of the Middle-Eastern nation of Kahndaq and one of the
   world's most powerful metahumans, launches a one-man military
   intervention into Syria to rescue an American journalist, Jack Ryder,
   from the terrorist group King Kobra after both America and Russia
   announce full military withdrawal from the Middle East. He then issues
   an open-ended invitation to all metahumans around the world, offering
   them asylum in Kahndaq.

   At the Daily Planet, Lois Lane is arguing with her editor, Perry White,
   about his inclusion of the word "Metahuman" in her reporting of the
   attack on Luthor despite their being no evidence of any metahuman
   involvement. White defends his decision, noting that the world's faith
   in superheroes is faltering, and that if she wants to restore their
   faith, she needs to prove them wrong. She storms out of his office in
   anger. Witnessing Pozhar's press conference, Lois and Superman decide
   to investigate the origins of the Supermen Theory in the hopes of
   averting a global catastrophe. Lois secures an interview with Lex at
   the hospital where he is recovering. Lex claims that he was targeted
   because he was himself investigating the Department of Metahuman
   Affairs, the supposed government agency at the center of the Supermen
   Theory, and discovered that its leader is himself a superhero.
   Superman, listening in, is disgusted when Luthor claims they were once
   a member of the Justice League.

   Johnny Thunder escapes from his retirement community after reading
   about a mysterious green fire which destroyed the All-American Steel
   Factory in Pittsburgh. Making his way there, he realizes that the
   workers must have attempted to melt down the power battery belonging to
   the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott, one of Johnny's missing
   comrades and friends from the Justice Society of America. He is
   accosted by heroin addicts squatting on the property and while fleeing
   finds the battery. The addicts catch up and attempt to beat him to
   death with the battery, only to be intercepted by Rorschach, who
   brutally dispatches them. Saturn Girl arrives and comforts Johnny,
   while Rorschach recovers the battery.

   Mime and Marionette cut a bloody path through Gotham searching for the
   Joker, unknowingly pursued by Blake. One of Joker's thugs reveals that
   the Clown Prince of Crime is launching an attack on the Gotham City
   Police Department at midnight, taking advantage of the ongoing protests
   to destroy the Bat Signal on the roof. Arriving at the specified time,
   they find the police crippled, and watch as the signal is pushed from
   the rooftop as Ozymandias makes evasive maneuvers in the skies around
   them. Initially finding the situation romantic, they are quickly
   interrupted by the Joker himself, who is none too pleased to see them.
   He is quickly distracted, however, when his henchmen drag the
   unconscious Batman onto the roof.

Issue 6: "Truly Laugh" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   In the past, Erika Manson and her father operate a puppet shop in New
   York City, where she plays with her marionette Sophia. One day, another
   store opens across the street, and she befriends the mute boy who runs
   the store with his parents, Marco Maez, who drives off a group of
   bullies who terrorized Erika. Returning to their home, they discover
   two policemen picking up a puppet from Erika's father, who tell Marco
   his mother has died after falling down a flight of stairs. Sometime
   later, the policemen return, and it is revealed they have been
   extorting the immigrant families in the neighborhood, including the
   Mansons and the Maezs. When Marco's mother tried to defy them, they
   murdered her. They threaten Erika when her father attempts to rid
   himself of them, and in a last bid to protect her, he kills himself so
   that they cannot harm her. However, Erika and Marco, who was informed
   of their role in his mother's death, kill the cops in retaliation and
   grow up on the street, making money through street performances, before
   eventually growing into the criminal duo of Marionette and Mime.

   In the present day, Mime and Marionette are taken captive by the Joker,
   who is too delighted by his capture of Batman to execute them. They are
   brought to a meeting of the Legion of Doom beneath Gotham, organized by
   Riddler to discuss the ongoing international crisis and decide on a
   course of action. During this meeting, it is revealed the Amazons have
   recalled Wonder Woman to Paradise Island, the Green Lanterns and their
   rogues have scattered into space, and Task Force X has gone missing in
   Kahndaq after a botched assassination attempt on Black Adam. At the
   same time, Japan and Australia have begun to mobilize metahuman armies
   of their own, further escalating tensions. As the federal government
   has captured a number of supervillains already, the Legion is divided
   between seeking asylum in Kahndaq or to continue operations as is.
   Further compounding the problem is the presence of Typhoon and Moonbow,
   two supervillains named as federal agents by the Supermen Theory. After
   voting to eject Typhoon from the Legion, he grows defensive and
   prepares to attack everyone else when he is gunned down by Comedian,
   who has tracked Mime and Marionette. Horrified by his appearance,
   Marionette grabs Mime and flees while Comedian fights the villains.
   Mime and Marionette take refuge in a motel, sleeping together, before
   they are found once again by Comedian who reveals he is trying to find
   Ozymandias. Before he can extract the information, he is ambushed and
   incapacitated by Joker, who thanks Mime and Marionette for entertaining
   him as he takes Comedian's Badge. Marionette realizes Comedian knows
   where Doctor Manhattan is, and Joker decides he will be joining them in
   their search for further amusement.

   At the Department of Metahuman Affairs, the suspicions surrounding
   Typhoon and Moonbow are revealed to be true, confirming at least part
   of the Supermen Theory. The Director orders for Typhoon's body to be
   retrieved for study.

Issue 7: "Blind Spot" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Doctor Manhattan's disjointed temporal perspective leads to him to muse
   on the fate of Alan Scott, the Green Lantern and founder of the Justice
   Society. In the original timeline of events, Alan Scott was involved in
   a railroad bridge collapse, narrowly saved when he grabbed hold of a
   mystical lantern forged in China a millennium earlier. However,
   Manhattan's experiments with the timeline result in a different
   outcome: the lantern is moved six inches out of Alan's reach, and he
   dies in the crash. The Justice Society never forms, and the foundations
   are laid for the modern day.

   In the present, Rorschach, Saturn Girl, and Johnny Thunder are
   discussing the newly acquired power battery when they are found by
   Ozymandias. Saturn Girl reveals her true identity and origins to the
   disbelief of both Ozymandias and Rorschach. Veidt begins to wonder
   whether or not they have any chance of finding Doctor Manhattan when
   Bubastis begins to glow, indicating that he is near. They follow her
   lead as she glows brighter and brighter.

   In Joker's lair, Mime and Marionette torture the Comedian, trying to
   extract Manhattan's location, while Joker looks on in amusement.
   Comedian reveals that Manhattan brought him to the present to kill
   Bubastis, as the cat is distressing him. They are interrupted when
   Batman frees himself and a brawl ensues. At first, Batman has the upper
   hand, but gradually his fatigued state wears on him and he is
   overwhelmed by their numbers before the timely arrival of Ozymandias
   and Rorschach brings the fighting to a halt. Batman admits he was wrong
   about Reggie as Bubastis begins to surge with energy. Ozymandias begins
   to demand that Jon show himself when blue energy surges from inside the
   power battery and Doctor Manhattan materializes before them. He quickly
   draws a circle in the floor and teleports himself and the others away,
   leaving Batman and Joker behind.

   Floating in another location, Veidt begs Jon to return to their world
   and save it from destruction, but Manhattan refuses. He reveals that he
   knows Veidt wanted to recruit Laurie Juspeczyk for the mission, but she
   refused, and instead pointed him towards Mime and Marionette for their
   miraculous survival. When questioned on this by Marionette, he reveals
   that it was because he saw her child's future, and decided it was worth
   preserving. When pressed on his location, Manhattan reveals that
   Marionette is actually pregnant once again due to her night with Mime,
   and it is this child he chose to save. Manhattan states that no matter
   what Adrian says, it will not change his mind, and that he will forever
   be a disappointment in his eyes. When Rorschach attempts to claim that
   Veidt has reformed due to his affliction with cancer, Manhattan glares
   at Ozymandias, and coldly states that he does not have cancer. Shocked,
   Rorschach demands an explanation, and Ozymandias reveals that he needed
   Reggie in order to carry out his plan as he needed a capable henchman,
   faking the cancer diagnosis and symptoms in order to sell the act.
   Ozymandias refocuses his attention on Manhattan, wanting to know why he
   came to this universe of all places. Manhattan reveals that originally
   he had hoped to find a place among them, a place where he could fit in,
   but in his curiosity he discovered something far more ominous: his
   visions of the future stop approximately one month into the future.
   After that, no matter how far he looks, there is only nothingness.
   Ozymandias tries to discern what this means, but he and the others are
   returned to their normal location by Manhattan, who departs for Mars
   once again.

   Before Ozymandias can come up with a plan of action, Rorschach savagely
   attacks him, prepared to kill him. Mime and Marionette take the power
   battery and depart. When Joker intervenes in the fight, he too is
   beaten to within an inch of his life, but when he draws a smiley face
   in blood on Rorschach's mask, Reggie takes off the mask and flees.
   Ozymandias takes the opportunity to escape, knocking out Saturn Girl
   and Johnny Thunder, before taking off with a new plan that he believes
   will save both their worlds. Batman inspects Joker before picking up
   Rorschach's mask and going after him.

   All around the world, nationalized teams of metahumans carry out
   missions on behalf of their governments. Superman is the only hero
   allowed to freely travel internationally anymore as his heroic actions
   speak for themselves. In the midst of all of this, Black Adam attacks
   Israel, a dangerous escalation of the situation. The so-called Super
   War appears imminent.

   On Mars, Manhattan contemplates what could possibly stop his visions,
   and thinks on the last thing he sees: Superman. As the world burns
   around them, Superman approaches Doctor Manhattan, and throws a single
   punch. Doctor Manhattan is left to wonder whether Superman somehow
   destroys him, or if he will destroy everything.

Issue 8: "Save Humanity" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Now aware that Manhattan is attempting to accelerate the events leading
   to the end, Ozymandias breaks into the White House and seizes a file
   from the Oval Office. At the same time, Lois and Clark Kent are at work
   at the Daily Planet when news breaks that Firestorm has attacked the
   People's Heroes in Russia. Firestorm, a hero composed of two separate
   individuals, Ronnie Raymond and Professor Martin Stein, is increasingly
   distraught at the public suspicion of him and has decided to take
   action against those he deems responsible. In the midst of the
   fighting, Firestorm seems to cause a crowd of protestors to turn to
   glass, despite the fact that his powers have never before been capable
   of affecting organic life. Clark rushes off in the guise of Superman to
   handle the situation while Lois investigates an envelope that was
   mailed to her anonymously. When she opens the envelope, she finds a USB
   drive which contains archived newsreel footage from 1941, detailing the
   exploits of the Justice Society of America.

   Superman flies to Kahndaq, where Firestorm is rumored to have taken
   refuge. Black Adam meets with him, and reveals the reports to be false.
   The two argue over the growing global crisis and their roles in it,
   with Superman warning Black Adam not to launch any further
   interventions outside his borders. Superman flies to Russia, where he
   finds Firestorm desperately trying to fix a young boy turned to glass.
   With Superman's encouragement, he is able to reverse the effect.
   Superman flies to Moscow to speak to the Russians and convince them of
   Firestorm's innocence, all the while issuing a speech denouncing the
   Supermen Theory and the demonization of metahumans. He is contacted
   remotely by Batman, who is en route to investigate. He warns him to
   stop talking, and not to pick sides. Superman ignores him and
   continues. Firestorm arrives seconds later with the cured boy, but the
   Russians views him as a threat and begins to move against him, killing
   several of the people turned to glass. Superman rushes to defend
   Firestorm and engages the Russian military on live television. As the
   battle escalates, Firestorm seems poised to release another glassing
   wave. Superman rushes to him to convince him to calm down, and he does.

   However, Batman detects the energy levels around them are still rising,
   and realizes the energy is Doctor Manhattan's. A massive explosion
   occurs, consuming Firestorm and Superman, downing Batman's aircraft,
   and knocking out all technology. From a secure location, Ozymandias
   watches with satisfaction.

     urge to rule."

Issue 9: "Crisis" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   After investigating the disastrous events in Moscow, every hero
   available is called in for a mission to Mars to confront Doctor
   Manhattan, whose energy has been traced back to him. Firestorm is
   brought along on the expedition while the comatose Superman and Batman
   are tended to on Earth. Batman awakens first, and when informed of the
   situation, tries to warn the heroes not to engage. He knows Firestorm
   did not cause the explosion, but discrepancies lead him to question
   whether or not Manhattan was truly responsible. He laments that he did
   not listen to Rorschach as his message fails to reach the heroes.

   On Mars, the heroes make contact with Doctor Manhattan and attempt to
   ascertain his motives. When they discover his vision of Superman, they
   move to stop him. However, Manhattan easily overwhelms them, learning
   about and adapting their superpowers as they go. Firestorm, eager for
   payback, storms into the fray only for Manhattan to show him a vision
   of the past in which he discovers his mentor, Martin Stein, engineered
   the accident that created him. Furthermore, he learns that Stein is in
   fact the Director of the Department of Metahuman Affairs, and that the
   Supermen Theory originated with his experiments. While the Department
   did create several heroes and villains as part of their experiments,
   few knew of their involvement, and fewer still actually worked for
   them. Realizing this and seeing an exponentially growing number of
   metahumans, Stein engineered a final experiment to infiltrate the
   superhero community from the inside and keep them on a leash, resulting
   in the accident which fused him and young Ronald Raymond into
   Firestorm.

   Horrified and enraged, Firestorm unleashes his full strength upon
   Doctor Manhattan, and damages him. Inspired, the rest of the heroes
   launch a combined offensive, weakening and knocking Manhattan down
   before Captain Atom attempts to take him apart on the molecular level.
   At first, he seems successful, only for Manhattan to quickly
   regenerate. Having had enough, he wipes out the heroes in a single
   attack.

   On Earth, Superman is comatose in the Hall of Justice, watched over by
   his wife as protestors gather outside. To Lois's shock, Lex Luthor pays
   a visit, and reveals that he was the one who sent the file containing
   the footage of the J.S.A. and that he has discovered the truth behind
   the manipulations of the universe. In Gotham, Reggie lies broken in an
   alleyway as riots consume the city, and the U.N meets in emergency
   session to be addressed by the recently returned Wonder Woman, who
   intends to unveil a comprehensive peace plan to defuse the rapidly
   escalating situation worldwide. However as she delivers her opening
   remarks, Black Adam attacks the building while Ozymandias observes.

Issue 10: "Action" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Victorious on Mars, Doctor Manhattan thinks over the events that have
   lead him here, as he considers his imminent fate. After entering the
   Multiverse following the events of Watchmen, Doctor Manhattan arrived
   in the current universe in 1938. Arriving in Los Angeles, he
   encountered a young man named Carver Coleman, an aspiring actor.
   Curious and unable to see the timeline, he accompanies Carver to a
   nearby diner, where he reads Carver's future to adjust himself to this
   new reality. The two form a mutually beneficial relationship with
   Carver being encouraged by Doctor Manhattan's prophetic visions and
   Manhattan using Carver to anchor himself in this new reality. They meet
   once every year in the same diner until Carver's untimely death. This
   encounter inadvertently leads him to discover Superman, who has just
   revealed himself to the public for the first time. Soon after Manhattan
   witnesses the emergence of a number of costumed heroes with superhuman
   abilities, who form the Justice Society of America alongside Superman.

   As Manhattan observes this, something unusual happens. Superman's
   appearance in the timeline suddenly moves forward to 1956. His
   appearance in 1938 and subsequent activities prior to 1956 suddenly
   disappear, leaving the JSA to form without him. Superman's emergence
   moves forward again to the 1980's and then further along still.
   Manhattan begins to realize that he has not just entered a parallel
   universe, but the Metaverse, the baseline universe from which all
   others emerge, changes to which are reflected throughout the
   multiverse. Powerful forces can influence it, which is the cause of the
   changing timeline.

   Manhattan grows curious as to its properties, and becomes fixated with
   Superman, whose influence is seemingly infinite despite the constantly
   changing timeline, and yet Manhattan cannot understand why. Eventually,
   he decides to experiment on the Metaverse himself. He prevents the
   formation of the JSA and Legion of Superheroes before killing
   Superman's parents in a car crash. These events in tandem cause
   Superman to grow distant and cold, which encourages Manhattan as he
   believes it brings him closer to understanding him. However, Manhattan
   discovers he has underestimated the Metaverse, which is actively
   resisting the changes he has made as it attempts to return to its
   normal state. He visits Carver Coleman one last time on the night of
   his death, where Manhattan realizes the Metaverse has turned against
   him, and sees the vision of his inevitable confrontation with Superman
   and the unknown fate which lies beyond it.

   In the present day, Manhattan ensures the heroes on Mars remain
   incapacitated as the moment of truth approaches, before teleporting to
   Earth just in time for Superman to awaken from his coma.

Issue 11: "A Lifelong Mistake" [yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D] Edit

   Luthor tells Lois that he was tracking several anomalies related to the
   current timeline. After reading Kovacs’ journal, Alfred tries to
   convince Reggie to help him, but the latter refuses and leaves. Mime
   and Marionette still hold Comedian hostage while Black Adam moves on
   the White House after the Amazons take Wonder Woman back to Themyscira.
   Ozymandias reveals to Imra and Johnny that Mime and Marionette's son
   was adopted by Daniel Dreiberg and Laurel Juspeczyk, who will have a
   daughter on their own. Ozymandias also reveals that he leaked Stein's
   involvement with the Supermen Theory, and that Bubastis II caused the
   explosion around Firestorm and Superman in order to frame Doctor
   Manhattan and make him confront the other heroes on Mars; Ozymandias
   sustains it s all part of his new plan to save both universes. Imra is
   erased from the timeline; at the White House, Superman confronts Black
   Adam. In the middle of these events, Superman finally meets Doctor
   Manhattan in person.

   Among the LexCorp files, there are "copies" of Manhattan's photo with
   his ex-wife, Janey Slater, alongside a picture of Barry Allen meeting
   Jay Garrick. Luthor tells Lois that he wants to find Manhattan,
