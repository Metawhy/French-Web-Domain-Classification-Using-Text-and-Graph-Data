   The work of Translators without Borders is making an impact all over
   the world. Explore the map to learn more.

   Worked with emergency response agencies in the United States and the
   Caribbean to translate hurricane preparedness messages into Spanish,
   Arabic, and Vietnamese, for those affected by devastating storms.

   Worked with partner Asociación CoCoSI in El Salvador to reduce stigma
   and discrimination through non-binary gender education and raising of
   awareness in children.

   Trained 15 Guinean translators and simplified and translated 800,000
   words so that West African communities can access more health care
   information in their local language.

   Worked with local and international humanitarian agencies in response
   to the European refugee crisis to provide rapid translation services
   in 6 languages. Trained over 480 interpreters and translators and
   created the first humanitarian interpreter roster.

   Translated the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability
   into Swahili for partner CHS Alliance.

   Developed the world’s first ever offline crisis-specific machine
   translation engine for Kurdish languages, Sorani and Kurmanji.

   Worked with the Wiki Project Med Foundation to translate 6,000 health
   articles for the Chinese version of the offline medical Wikipedia app.

   Responding to the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh where over
   700,000 refugees are in need of vital information in a language they
   can understand. TWB is developing language capacity in the area.

Language makes a difference

     Lionbridge is honoured to support Translators without Borders, both
     directly as a Diamond sponsor for many years, but also by
     encouraging our local employees to engage in fundraising efforts,
     translation and project management volunteering, and other special
     projects. Our ‘pride’ of Lions is deeply committed to the causes
     championed by Translators without Borders’ tireless efforts.
     Lionbridge’s more than 6,000 employees are humbled to know that they
     are contributing to projects such …

   Paula Barbary ShannonChief Sales Officer, SVPLionbridge

     It is extremely important to provide medically accurate and easy to
     understand Ebola information in a community’s local language. Our
     posters, leaflets and video materials are being used across West
     Africa: in shops, hotels and banks, in clinics, hospitals and mining
     sites. They are also present in airports and at a number
     of checkpoints. The use of these materials would simply not be so
     widespread without the work of Translators without Borders to help
     get this medical advice to the people …

   Dr Doug Quarry, Group Medical Director, Medical Information and
   Analysis at International SOS:

     This is vital work, and translation makes the diﬀerence. Your
     professionalism … for this piece of work is impressive and the
     impact it will have on our Arabic speaking audience, which includes
     those Syrians directly aﬀected by this crisis, will be profound.

   Andrew Alspach, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

     The ability of Wikipedia to provide free, accurate, and accessible
     health care content to people in their native languages is possible
     in large part because of TWB.

   Lucas Rosnau, Translation Coordinator, WikiProject Med Foundation

     On behalf of Fairstart Global, we wish to thank you for your
     fantastic work, assisting the efforts to improve foster care and
     orphanage systems in Japan. Thanks to TWB, our caregiver and leader
     training programs are now available in Japanese at
     http://www.fairstartglobaljapan.org and we feel confident that our
     programs will support efforts to provide Japanese children with
     quality care educated foster parents. Thanks again TWB for your
     invaluable help to create quality care for the 100 million child…

   Niels Peter Rygaard, DPA authorized psychologist, founder of Fairstart
   Global, which trains orphanage workers around the world

     I just wanted to thank you sincerely for all of your hard work
     coordinating these translations. They look wonderful and have
     generated lovely responses. I hope we can push them out fast enough
     to refugees so they really make an impact!

   Meena Bhandari, International Federation of the Red Cross and Red
   Crescent Societies

     It is both amazing and also very comforting and inspiring to see
     people donate their time and skills to defend the principles of
     action and the ideas of humanitarian assistance.

   Olivier Bluteau, Field Manager for Doctors without Borders

     During a crisis where information and eﬀective communicating are so
     important, the work of Translators without Borders ensures that
     humanitarian organizations working within the response are able to
     get information in local languages to the people in need.

   James Purcell, Humanitarian Programme Manager for DFID

     It is absolutely critical to our work that we can engage with
     disabled fans and other stakeholders across Europe, in a language
     that they understand. As a small team, we can’t speak every
     language, so we rely massively on Translators without Borders to
     help us to communicate. Communication is key to everything we do,
     and that is why Translators without Borders is such an invaluable
     asset to us.

   Michael RiceMedia and Communications ManagerCentre for Access to
   Football in Europe (CAFE)

     Language is central to all of our education efforts. Health
     education material is useless to people who cannot understand the
     language in which it is written. TWB greatly extends the reach of
     our programs and enables us to fully serve remote areas.
