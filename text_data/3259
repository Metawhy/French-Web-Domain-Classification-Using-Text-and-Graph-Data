TwistedSifter 3.0


   Since launching in March of 2009, TwistedSifter has been through a lot.
   The site has grown, the site has crashed, pictures have been posted and
   good times have been had.

   Today I’m pleased to announce the second major redesign in the site’s
   history. The first redesign was March 2011, and since then the usage of
   tablets and smartphones have dramatically increased. Readers are now
   accessing the Sifter from a variety of screen sizes and resolutions and
   the current site was not adapting adequately.

   So with that, we find ourselves here. Check out the major changes below
   and get ready for an improved Sifting experience!


                              Responsive Design

   TwistedSifter is now responsive. This means whatever your screen
   resolution may be, TwistedSifter will adapt to provide you an optimal
   viewing experience. Browse the site on your smartphone, tablet or giant
   26″ monitor; the site will be ready to do thy bidding.


                               Infinite Scroll

   The homepage has now been equipped with infinite scroll. Just like
   Facebook and Twitter, you can now scroll through every post ever
   published on the site, all 2,000+ of them!


                             Categories and Tags

   I’ve created a few new categories (e.g., ‘lists‘), renamed a couple
   (‘homes & buildings’ is now ‘architecture‘), and even split
   Nature/Animals into separate entities. All of the primary categories
   can now be found on the main menu bar instead of having to use a
   drop-down menu.

   As the number of posts has surpassed the 2,000 mark I’ve found the
   general category headers too broad. Now with a healthy amount of
   archived content, I’ve begun the laborious task of tagging all previous
   posts. This is a work in progress and I’ve barely scratched the
   surface. My personal goal is to have almost all posts tagged by the end
   of the year.

   Once properly tagged you will then be able to really drill into niche
   topics within the broader categories. For example, you’ll be able to
   see just ‘street art’ or ‘sculptures’ within the art section etc. It’s
   a slow process but one that I will chip away at each day.


                              WordPress.com VIP

   The Sifter is delighted to partner with WordPress.com VIP for hosting
   and support. I hold them in the highest regard and would recommend
   their services to any site owner who dreams of not having to worry
   about downtime.


                            Previous/Next Buttons

   For those with a screen width greater than 1400 pixels, you will now
   see two orange arrows on either side of the screen. If you hover over
   the arrows, the title for the next/previous post will appear. Clicking
   the arrow will take you too that post.

   For those with screen widths less than 1400 pixels, the orange arrows
   will appear at the bottom of the post.


                                Pinteresting

   The Pinterest button has been updated for all you pinners! Now when you
   click the Pinterest button at the top or bottom of each post, a
   complete gallery of all images in the article will pop-up for you to
   choose from.


                                 Easter Egg

   For the fellow sifters there’s a fun little easter egg on the page.
   Scroll around and maybe you’ll notice it.


                               The Code Master

   None of this would have been possible without the help and support of
   my friend Mohammad Jangda. His expertise has been instrumental in the
   evolution of TwistedSifter and I can’t thank him enough for all of his
   time and insight.


                                  Feedback

   Relaunching a site is tough! While I’ve tried my best to test out the
   site on various browsers and devices there’s no way to catch
   everything. If you have any feedback (positive or negative) or notice
   any strange glitches, please do let me know in the comments below or
   via email at: admin@twistedsifter.com

   None of this would be possible without your readership and support. I
   can’t thank you enough for taking time out of your lives to check out
   the site. I will strive to keep providing you with content that
   educates, entertains and inspires.

   Stay sifty my friends!
