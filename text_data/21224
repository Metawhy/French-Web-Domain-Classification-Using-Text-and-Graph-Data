ECALAS

   Since the start of the first ECATA ABI Course in 1992 all participants
   upon graduating become members of the ECATA Alumni Association known as
   ECALAS. The association can count more than 400 members globally and is
   growing annually.

   To foster the idea of a living, information exchanging network, ECALAS’
   keynote event is the ECALAS International Aerospace Seminar. Starting
   1996 the event is held annually and is an opportunity for the ECALAS
   members to meet, discuss and learn from each other as well as from high
   level speakers being from across the Aerospace Industry and University.

   The dynamic ECALAS association constitutes an effective European
   network that is useful for current and future European Aerospace
   challenges in the world.

WHAT OUR FANTASTIC DELEGATES SAY

     * "The ECATA programme is the only European programme that creates
       lasting relationships across leading Aerospace companies with the
       specific objective of these relationships creating a better
       European Aerospace capability."
       ECATA 1991
       M. TAYLOR
       Managing Director Combat Air - BAE SYSTEMS
     * “Apart from business topics, the personality development and team
       building exercises in ABI are really world class. We got introduced
       to multiple tools to check the team dynamics and needs of diverse,
       multicultural teams working in complex projects with tough
       deadline. ABI is truly a remarkable experience in my career.”
       ECATA 2016
        A. Thinket Selvan
       M&P Engineer - AIRBUS
     * “ECATA was life changing for me; not because of a classical career
       progression, but because I decided to provoke my company to
       revolutionise itself after I completed the course. I could see that
       the world was changing faster than the industry and I felt
       compelled to act. I began a journey that has rocked Airbus with
       disruptive thinking and ways of working: more collaboration, less
       structure, more humanity and more innovation.”
       ECATA 2015
       M. BAILEY
       Systems Innovation and Research Manager - AIRBUS
     * “ECATA course has widen my understanding of our industry from a
       strategic standpoint along the global aerospace value chain. This
       programme is a real opportunity to open your mind on new topics.
       Later on, it gave me the willing to evolve within my company
       towards a job dealing with another part of the engine life cycle
       and much more business oriented.”
       ECATA 2015
       K. Florentin
       Customer Program Manager - Safran Aircraft Engines
     * “ECATA experience gives the opportunity to have a break in a
       career. Bringing together this variety of nationalities, companies
       and characters is very enriching and gives unique points of views.
       ”
       ECATA 2015
       E. Rocca
       Program support manager -  Dassault Aviation
     * “My time on the ECATA programme gave me a unique insight in to
       Aerospace industry outside of my organisation to what can be
       achieved when a group of individuals with the same energy all work
       together for a common goal irrespective of culture or organisation.
       This experience influences the way I make decisions in my
       professional life.”
       ECATA 2014

       Lead Engineer - Typhoon Avionics Test & Evaluation
       - BAE Systems
