   Beautiful colors and fun prints ... so hard to choose. That´s why I
   created these earring sets. Two pairs for 14 euro, just for you, your
   friend or your sister. You can find them in my shop

Peaches & Peaches Pt. II

   [P1060275.JPG]
   This Summer I cooperated with Karolien and Lies from Peaches & Peaches.
   I was curious to know how they would style my jewelry. I really like
   the way Karolien integrated romantic pieces of jewelry in her edgy
   style. In the pictures below Karolien is wearing a chunky beaded
   necklace, a pair of collar clips and the gathering birds ring.

   Karolien and I had a little talk and this is what she had to say ...
   VB: Tell us something about yourself.
   Karolien: I´m Karolien, one of the peaches in Peaches & Peaches, and a
   sucker for customized band tees and cut-off denim shorts. Basically an
   organized chaos with a love for fashion and working hard on a PhD in
   psychology.
   VB: What do you like about being a fashion blogger?
   Karolien: I would not even call myself a fashion blogger, but blogging
   for me is all about expressing myself and finding a way to channel my
   creativity. It´s also fun to read tons of interesting stuff and
   updating my own writing skills.
   VB: How would you describe your style and in what sense is it different
   from the style of Lies?
   Karolien: My style is mostly quite edgy with some rock vibes, but on
   other occasions I find myself dressing candy sweet and cute. Because of
   this eclectic style, Lies and I look very alike on some days, but can
   differ as day and night on other days (that is when I am letting my
   inner rock star out).
   VB: What are your must haves for a typical cold and gray belgian
   winter?
   Karolien: A good, warm coat is a necessity when living in Belgium, as
   well as sturdy (biker) boots. However, what really cannot lack in your
   wardrobe when wanting to survive the belgian winter is a beanie in
   every color available.
   VB: Do you have recommendations for other bloggers?
   Karolien: Just do your own thing!
   The outfits of Lies, the other half of Peaches & Peaches, can be
   found here.

   [070613-03.jpg]
   Dorien from Fashion Freaks has style, that´s the least we can say when
   looking at these pictures. Her outfits are playful and well combined
   and I always think "I would love to have this exact same outfit in my
   closet".
   I got to know Dorien when I asked her if she wanted to style some of my
   jewelry in her outfit posts. You can see the results here and here.
   Now, here´s a short Q&A with Dorien so you guys can get to know her a
   little bit better too.
   VB: Tell us something about yourself.
   Dorien: I am Dorien Swerts, graduate communication management. I´m
   currently working to save up for a Master Fashion Management in Milan.
   My blog is about fashion. I share outfits on my blog, things that
   inspire me and products I like.
   VB: How would you describe your style?
   Dorien: My style is very versatile. One day I can wear dresses and
   pumps, the other day I can wear jeans and boots.
   VB: What was your latest fashion purchase?
   Dorien: A pair of very cute brown heeled ankle boots from avance (take
   a look at them here)
   VB: Which are your favorite belgian blogs?
   VB: Fashionata, Fashionfolio, Je suis Sophie and Anouk meets fashion.

   Our cooperation continues... Dorien wants to thank her fans with a new
   give away and I donated one of my necklaces from the Goldies collection
   to do that. Here you can find out what you have to do to win. Good luck
   guys!

   Geometric shapes and golden colored jewelry is the perfect match for me
   lately. Simple and elegant. These pieces fit with almost every outfit.
   I updated my shop on Etsy and on Facebook with these lovely pieces.
   Enjoy your Sunday!
