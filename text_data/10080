Password security can’t wait

Secure every password-protected entry point to your business.

Passwords are frustrating – and insecure

   When it comes to protecting today’s digital business, a spreadsheet of
   passwords just won’t cut it anymore.
   i_shadow-it-svg

Passwords are cumbersome

   The average employee struggles with nearly 200 credentials to keep
   track of.
   i_risk-svg

Poor habits = more risk

   80% of data breaches can be traced to weak, reused, and stolen
   credentials.
   lp-enterprise-icon-a-3-svg

Password sharing is a pain

   Credentials get passed around by email, chat, or paper, exposing the
   business to risk.
   i_low-speed-svg

Productivity is impacted

   When employees are distracted by lockouts and resets, they’re not
   getting work done.
   i_monitor-svg

IT lacks control

   Businesses can’t protect what they can’t see. IT has little visibility
   into password security.
   i_devices-svg

Employees leave with access

   When onboarding is manual and piecemeal, former workers can still
   access company data.
   _solutions_business-password-manager_01-png

Protect every password in your business

   Every password is an entryway to your business, and a password manager
   makes it easy to secure them all.
   i_vault-svg

Secure password storage

   Give employees their own vault for storing every app and web login they
   use.
   i_share-svg

Convenient password sharing

   Make it easy for employees to share logins while keeping access to
   corporate data safe.
   i_instant-svg

Streamlined logins

   Capture and fill every credential, without disrupting an employee’s
   workflow.
   i_centralized-control-svg

Centralized control

   Enforce policies and get actionable insights into employee password
   behavior from an admin dashboard.
   i_settings-svg

Simplified user management

   Instantly add and remove users, or automate user management with
   directory integration.
   i_any-location-svg

Access from anywhere

   No matter where employees work, they always have their passwords with
   them, from any device.

   easy-to-manage dashboard makes LastPass Teams an ideal password
