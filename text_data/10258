Gamer jailed for deadly 'swat' prank that started over $1.50 bet

   ORLANDO, Fla. — A media outlet reports an Arizona man has been
   sentenced to three days in jail after deputies say he falsely told
   guests at a Walt Disney World resort there was an active shooter on the
   property as part of a YouTube stunt.

   Orlando television station WKMG reports that authorities found
   22-year-old Dillion Burch was telling that lie to guests at the
   Contemporary Resort so he could get their reactions for his YouTube
   channel.

   Online court records show that Burch was facing disturbing the peace
   and disorderly intoxication records.

   The television station says Burch pleaded no contest to the charges
   Tuesday and drew the three-day sentence.

   No attorney was listed for him.

   Post

   If you’re a robot stealing somebody’s job, it’s best to stay hidden.

   That’s what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears to be thinking, as his
   Seattle-based web giant has contemplated a two-story, automated grocery
   store in which a staff of robots on the floor upstairs grabs and bags
   items for shoppers below.

Amazon plans to build flying warehouse to deploy drones

   Amazon isn’t just planning to fill the skies with drones...

   The ground level of the futuristic prototype — a supermarket-sized
   version of its recently unveiled “Amazon Go” convenience store, with a
   bigger layout that could span anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 square
   feet — would be devoted to goods that shoppers typically like to touch,
   sources briefed on the plans told The Post.

   Those could include as many as 4,000 items, spanning fresh fruits and
   vegetables, eggs, meats and cheeses, and grab-it-and-go stuff like beer
   and wine, the sources said. Pharmacies might also might spring up at
   some of the high-tech locations, as Amazon looks to break into the
   lucrative sector, insiders said.

   But for many, the most striking feature of the bigger stores is that
   they could operate with as few as three employees at a time. Sources
   said the plans call for staff to max out at 10 workers per location
   during any given shift.

   “Amazon will utilize technology to minimize labor,” a source close to
   the situation told The Post.

   Job-cutting technology isn’t new for Amazon, which has increasingly
   used robots to automate its distribution warehouses. More recently, it
   has been pioneering the use of drones to deliver packages instead of
   humans, and even filing patents for unmanned blimps that would serve as
   flying warehouses.

   In the case of Amazon’s automated retail prototype, a half-dozen
   workers could staff an average location. A manager’s duties would
   include signing up customers for the “Amazon Fresh” grocery service.
   Another worker would restock shelves, and still another two would be
   stationed at “drive-thru” windows for customers picking up their
   groceries, fast-food style.

   The last pair would work upstairs, helping the robots bag groceries to
   be sent down to customers on “dumbwaiter”-like conveyors, a source
   said.

   With the bare-bones payroll, the boost to profits could be huge.
   Indeed, the prototype being discussed calls for operating profit
   margins north of 20 percent. That compares with an industry average of
   just 1.7 percent, according to the Food Marketing Institute.

   Labor accounts for the lion’s share of a supermarket’s operating costs.
   In 2015, the industry employed 3.4 million workers nationwide, with an
   average grocery store employing 89 workers to generate annual sales of
   more than $2 million, according to the trade group.

   Amazon’s prototype, meanwhile, doesn’t call for any cashiers. It might,
   however, employ “greeters” that could serve as curbs against
   shoplifting — a key hazard for thinly staffed stores — in addition to
   using high-tech motion sensors to track wayward goods.

   Trademark Office

   “Shoplifting is a touchy subject for Amazon,” the source said, noting
   that Amazon may decide to bar its stores from shoppers who aren’t
   members of its “Prime” and “Prime Fresh” services, which carry annual
   fees.

   “In the view of Amazon, people who can afford Prime memberships aren’t
   likely to shoplift,” the source said. “If someone walks in off the
   street, they’ll be able to access the stores, but they’ll have to sign
   up for a membership which means showing an ID.”

   Elsewhere, the two-story design could boost earnings by slashing
   real-estate costs. The setup could eliminate at least half the aisles
   that account for a supermarket’s sprawl, with robots upstairs picking
   through between 15,000 and 20,000 staple items like breakfast cereal,
   spaghetti sauce, paper towels and soda.

   Sources cautioned that the prototype is still in the early stages, and
   that it hasn’t received a final nod. Reached Sunday, Amazon officials
   denied the company was planning a robot-driven supermarket chain.

   “As we’ve said previously, it’s not correct,” an Amazon spokesman told
   The Post. “We have no plans to build such a store.”

   In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon envisions
   opening as many as 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores across various
   formats — a number the company disputed.

   Nevertheless, a source said the 2,000-store, nationwide goal has been a
   real one inside the company, with execs eyeing a gradual rollout to
   gauge demand for the new concepts. A larger-prototype store could open
   as soon as late 2017, according to the source.

Amazon introduces next major job killer to face Americans

   Amazon on Monday unveiled the latest plan to automate American...
   The plans have already been telegraphed by Amazon consultant Brittain
   Ladd in a published paper, “A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,”
   according to a source close to the company.

   The smaller Amazon Go format, which spans just 1,800 square feet, has
   been opened at a single location in Seattle.

   As with Amazon Go, customers at the larger stores — targeted for the
   suburbs — could use an app on their phones to track items they’ve
   picked off shelves for purchase, with the app automatically recording
   what they’ve grabbed with the help of electronic sensors, sources said.

   “The products stocked within the store will be retrieved by an
   automated storage/retrieval system that I designed,” Ladd says in the
   paper.

   “Based on my analysis, I was able to achieve margins of between 22
   percent to 40 percent depending on the size and configuration of the
   multi-format store design and merchandising assortment. Such margins
   are unheard of even in the best-managed grocery retailers operating
   today,” Ladd wrote.

   The bird is clearly the word for the ringleader of a crew of strippers
   that drugged wealthy clients and racked up huge bills on their credit
   cards.

   Samantha Barbash, 43, flipped off a Post photographer after pleading
   guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five
   years probation.

   Justice Bonnie Wittner asked if she had anything to say. “I’m glad this
   is done,” she answered, wearing a black leather jacket, stilettos and
   waist-length blond extensions.

   Barbash was the last of her glamorous cohorts to be sentenced.

   Roselyn Keo, 33, also got a lenient deal. She copped to grand larceny
   and attempted assault in exchange for no jail time in March 2016, said
   the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor.

   Former Scores “massage” girl Karina Pascucci, 29, and Marsi Rosen, 31,
   were sentenced to weekends in jail for four months and five years’
   probation in January 2016. The two pleaded guilty to conspiracy, grand
   larceny and other raps as part of their agreement with prosecutors.

   The brunette temptresses trolled for their marks at fancy hotel bars
   then drugged their drinks, officials said.

   The half-conscious men were taken to strip clubs and separated from
   their credit cards, which the voluptuous vixens used to make thousands
   in charges for liquor and lap dances.

   The scheme was uncovered when Dr. Zyad Younan reported the scam to
   authorities. Pascucci lured him to Scores in 2013, drugged him and
   racked up $135,000 worth of charges on his credit card.

Shareholders to vote on New Media-Gannett merger in November

   Sports Illustrated’s media operations are getting a new operator.

   Authentic Brands Group — a licensing firm headed by Jamie Salter that
   acquired the venerable brand late last month from Meredith Corp. for
   $110 million — has turned around and licensed SI’s print and digital
   publishing rights to The Maven, a small publicly traded startup.

   Under the original sale agreement announced on May 27, Meredith was
   going to continue publishing the print and digital media under a
   two-year licensing deal. Sources said the deal required Meredith to pay
   between $10 million to $15 million a year to ABG for the publishing
   rights.

   Under terms of the latest deal, revealed in an SEC filing on Monday,
   The Maven has prepaid $45 million to ABG against future royalties under
   a 10-year licensing agreement with guaranteed yearly minimum royalty
   payments.

   “Meredith only had a short-term license deal,” ABG Chief Executive
   Jamie Salter told The Post. “Now, we have a long-term partner.”

   The license includes rights to the print version of Sports
   Illustrated—which appears every other week—as well as the annual SI
   Swimsuit issue and SI for Kids and the related digital properties.

   Ross Levinsohn, most recently CEO of Tribune Interactive, a part of
   Tribune Publishing which owns the Chicago Tribune and the New York
   Daily News, will be joining The Maven as the CEO of the Sports
   Illustrated media line.

   Headed by digital entrepreneur Jim Heckman, The Maven has lately been
   on the prowl for acquisitions. Only last week, it purchased Jim
   Cramer’s financial news site The Street for $16.5 million.

   And last month, The Maven had been backing retired NBA star Junior
   Bridgeman’s bid to buy Sports Illustrated, but lost out on its chance
   to take over the whole operation when Bridgeman himself could not
   produce his portion of the financing to close the deal, sources said.
   ABG swooped in at the eleventh hour to land the deal instead.

   Levinsohn and Heckman had partnered on a number of media ventures in
   the past including at Yahoo where Levinsohn was an acting CEO and
   Heckman was an SVP in charge of media strategy and at Fox Interactive,
   where Levinsohn was president. [At the time, Fox was part of News Corp.
   which is the parent company of the NY Post]

   In a statement, Meredith said the deal will allow it to “devote full
   resources and management attention to maximizing the profitability of
   the rest of its portfolio of leading media brands,” which include
   People, Entertainment Weekly, Food + Wine and Travel + Leisure and
   Martha Stewart Living.

   Maven and ABG are pursuing discussions with Meredith for it to continue
   to operate certain aspects of the business, including print operations.
   However, Monday’s deal is not contingent on reaching such an agreement
   with Meredith, according to the SEC filing.

   Under the deal, ABG also gets stock warrants in the fledgling Maven
   company.

   Meredith appears to be sanguine about losing the publishing rights and
   said it only hung onto the publishing operation initially to speed
   along the much-delayed selloff process.

   “As a result of ABG’s decision to license the Sports Illustrated media
   assets to a third party — which was ABG’s right under the contract —
   Meredith’s goal of a completed transaction is achieved.”

   Still, Meredith is not entirely clear of SI. It is still shopping the
   blog site Fansided, which was added to SI when it still part of Time
   Inc. but which was left out of the May 27 deal between ABG and
   Meredith.

   Newsday is selling its freebie commuter paper amNewYork, relinquishing
   its last toehold in the five boroughs as it concentrates on its core
   Long Island audience.

   The sale to Schneps Media, a growing publisher of weekly newspapers and
   magazines in the New York area, is effective Oct. 11. Terms were not
   disclosed, but according to one source amNewYork was estimated to be
   losing about $5 million a year.

   Schneps, which was started by chairman and co-publisher Vicky
   Schneps-Yunis, started with the Queens Courier in 1985 and now
   publishes 33 weekly newspapers and 28 niche magazines across the metro
   area.

   Schneps has been on a shopping spree. In December, it purchased New
   York Family from Manhattan Media, and in September 2018 it purchased
   the Community News Group from the husband-and-wife team of Les and
   Jennifer Goodstein.

   It 2017, it purchased the weekly Long Island Press from Morey
   Publishing, which relaunched the long-defunct daily as a weekly.

   amNewYork was launched by Russel Pergament in 2003 and was aimed
   primarily at giving rail and subway commuters a quick, free read. But
   the retrenchment of retail cutting into its ad base and the
   connectivity of mobile phones on subway and commuter rail lines meant
   less reason to pick up a newspaper.

   It appears the new owner plans to keep it going.

   “We are looking forward to enhancing amNewYork’s brand through our
   expertise in multi-platform media including print, digital, events,
   social media and broadcasting platforms,” said Joshua Schneps, Schneps
   Media co-publisher and CEO.

   Debby Krenek, publisher of the Newsday Media Group — now a privately
   owned entity controlled by Patrick Dolan — said that the company will
   double down on its focus on Long Island as it pushes beyond print.

   “Moving forward, Newsday Media Group will fully focus on serving Long
   Islanders with news, information and experiences as we continue to
   expand our multimedia products and platforms and fulfill our mission of
   being the primary source of powerful local journalism as ‘Your Eye on
   LI’,” Krenek said.

   Newsday farmed out its printing to a New York Times plant in College
   Point and recently moved from its longtime headquarters on a former
   pasture in Melville into a new facility in an office park at 6
   Corporate Center Drive, also in Melville.

Gamer jailed for deadly 'swat' prank that started over $1.50 bet

   ORLANDO, Fla. — A media outlet reports an Arizona man has been
   sentenced to three days in jail after deputies say he falsely told
   guests at a Walt Disney World resort there was an active shooter on the
   property as part of a YouTube stunt.

   Orlando television station WKMG reports that authorities found
   22-year-old Dillion Burch was telling that lie to guests at the
   Contemporary Resort so he could get their reactions for his YouTube
   channel.

   Online court records show that Burch was facing disturbing the peace
   and disorderly intoxication records.

   The television station says Burch pleaded no contest to the charges
   Tuesday and drew the three-day sentence.

   No attorney was listed for him.

   Post

   If you’re a robot stealing somebody’s job, it’s best to stay hidden.

   That’s what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears to be thinking, as his
   Seattle-based web giant has contemplated a two-story, automated grocery
   store in which a staff of robots on the floor upstairs grabs and bags
   items for shoppers below.

Amazon plans to build flying warehouse to deploy drones

   Amazon isn’t just planning to fill the skies with drones...

   The ground level of the futuristic prototype — a supermarket-sized
   version of its recently unveiled “Amazon Go” convenience store, with a
   bigger layout that could span anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 square
   feet — would be devoted to goods that shoppers typically like to touch,
   sources briefed on the plans told The Post.

   Those could include as many as 4,000 items, spanning fresh fruits and
   vegetables, eggs, meats and cheeses, and grab-it-and-go stuff like beer
   and wine, the sources said. Pharmacies might also might spring up at
   some of the high-tech locations, as Amazon looks to break into the
   lucrative sector, insiders said.

   But for many, the most striking feature of the bigger stores is that
   they could operate with as few as three employees at a time. Sources
   said the plans call for staff to max out at 10 workers per location
   during any given shift.

   “Amazon will utilize technology to minimize labor,” a source close to
   the situation told The Post.

   Job-cutting technology isn’t new for Amazon, which has increasingly
   used robots to automate its distribution warehouses. More recently, it
   has been pioneering the use of drones to deliver packages instead of
   humans, and even filing patents for unmanned blimps that would serve as
   flying warehouses.

   In the case of Amazon’s automated retail prototype, a half-dozen
   workers could staff an average location. A manager’s duties would
   include signing up customers for the “Amazon Fresh” grocery service.
   Another worker would restock shelves, and still another two would be
   stationed at “drive-thru” windows for customers picking up their
   groceries, fast-food style.

   The last pair would work upstairs, helping the robots bag groceries to
   be sent down to customers on “dumbwaiter”-like conveyors, a source
   said.

   With the bare-bones payroll, the boost to profits could be huge.
   Indeed, the prototype being discussed calls for operating profit
   margins north of 20 percent. That compares with an industry average of
   just 1.7 percent, according to the Food Marketing Institute.

   Labor accounts for the lion’s share of a supermarket’s operating costs.
   In 2015, the industry employed 3.4 million workers nationwide, with an
   average grocery store employing 89 workers to generate annual sales of
   more than $2 million, according to the trade group.

   Amazon’s prototype, meanwhile, doesn’t call for any cashiers. It might,
   however, employ “greeters” that could serve as curbs against
   shoplifting — a key hazard for thinly staffed stores — in addition to
   using high-tech motion sensors to track wayward goods.

   Trademark Office

   “Shoplifting is a touchy subject for Amazon,” the source said, noting
   that Amazon may decide to bar its stores from shoppers who aren’t
   members of its “Prime” and “Prime Fresh” services, which carry annual
   fees.

   “In the view of Amazon, people who can afford Prime memberships aren’t
   likely to shoplift,” the source said. “If someone walks in off the
   street, they’ll be able to access the stores, but they’ll have to sign
   up for a membership which means showing an ID.”

   Elsewhere, the two-story design could boost earnings by slashing
   real-estate costs. The setup could eliminate at least half the aisles
   that account for a supermarket’s sprawl, with robots upstairs picking
   through between 15,000 and 20,000 staple items like breakfast cereal,
   spaghetti sauce, paper towels and soda.

   Sources cautioned that the prototype is still in the early stages, and
   that it hasn’t received a final nod. Reached Sunday, Amazon officials
   denied the company was planning a robot-driven supermarket chain.

   “As we’ve said previously, it’s not correct,” an Amazon spokesman told
   The Post. “We have no plans to build such a store.”

   In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon envisions
   opening as many as 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores across various
   formats — a number the company disputed.

   Nevertheless, a source said the 2,000-store, nationwide goal has been a
   real one inside the company, with execs eyeing a gradual rollout to
   gauge demand for the new concepts. A larger-prototype store could open
   as soon as late 2017, according to the source.

Amazon introduces next major job killer to face Americans

   Amazon on Monday unveiled the latest plan to automate American...
   The plans have already been telegraphed by Amazon consultant Brittain
   Ladd in a published paper, “A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,”
   according to a source close to the company.

   The smaller Amazon Go format, which spans just 1,800 square feet, has
   been opened at a single location in Seattle.

   As with Amazon Go, customers at the larger stores — targeted for the
   suburbs — could use an app on their phones to track items they’ve
   picked off shelves for purchase, with the app automatically recording
   what they’ve grabbed with the help of electronic sensors, sources said.

   “The products stocked within the store will be retrieved by an
   automated storage/retrieval system that I designed,” Ladd says in the
   paper.

   “Based on my analysis, I was able to achieve margins of between 22
   percent to 40 percent depending on the size and configuration of the
   multi-format store design and merchandising assortment. Such margins
   are unheard of even in the best-managed grocery retailers operating
   today,” Ladd wrote.

   The bird is clearly the word for the ringleader of a crew of strippers
   that drugged wealthy clients and racked up huge bills on their credit
   cards.

   Samantha Barbash, 43, flipped off a Post photographer after pleading
   guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five
   years probation.

   Justice Bonnie Wittner asked if she had anything to say. “I’m glad this
   is done,” she answered, wearing a black leather jacket, stilettos and
   waist-length blond extensions.

   Barbash was the last of her glamorous cohorts to be sentenced.

   Roselyn Keo, 33, also got a lenient deal. She copped to grand larceny
   and attempted assault in exchange for no jail time in March 2016, said
   the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor.

   Former Scores “massage” girl Karina Pascucci, 29, and Marsi Rosen, 31,
   were sentenced to weekends in jail for four months and five years’
   probation in January 2016. The two pleaded guilty to conspiracy, grand
   larceny and other raps as part of their agreement with prosecutors.

   The brunette temptresses trolled for their marks at fancy hotel bars
   then drugged their drinks, officials said.

   The half-conscious men were taken to strip clubs and separated from
   their credit cards, which the voluptuous vixens used to make thousands
   in charges for liquor and lap dances.

   The scheme was uncovered when Dr. Zyad Younan reported the scam to
   authorities. Pascucci lured him to Scores in 2013, drugged him and
   racked up $135,000 worth of charges on his credit card.

   Sports Illustrated’s media operations are getting a new operator.

   Authentic Brands Group — a licensing firm headed by Jamie Salter that
   acquired the venerable brand late last month from Meredith Corp. for
   $110 million — has turned around and licensed SI’s print and digital
   publishing rights to The Maven, a small publicly traded startup.

   Under the original sale agreement announced on May 27, Meredith was
   going to continue publishing the print and digital media under a
   two-year licensing deal. Sources said the deal required Meredith to pay
   between $10 million to $15 million a year to ABG for the publishing
   rights.

   Under terms of the latest deal, revealed in an SEC filing on Monday,
   The Maven has prepaid $45 million to ABG against future royalties under
   a 10-year licensing agreement with guaranteed yearly minimum royalty
   payments.

   “Meredith only had a short-term license deal,” ABG Chief Executive
   Jamie Salter told The Post. “Now, we have a long-term partner.”

   The license includes rights to the print version of Sports
   Illustrated—which appears every other week—as well as the annual SI
   Swimsuit issue and SI for Kids and the related digital properties.

   Ross Levinsohn, most recently CEO of Tribune Interactive, a part of
   Tribune Publishing which owns the Chicago Tribune and the New York
   Daily News, will be joining The Maven as the CEO of the Sports
   Illustrated media line.

   Headed by digital entrepreneur Jim Heckman, The Maven has lately been
   on the prowl for acquisitions. Only last week, it purchased Jim
   Cramer’s financial news site The Street for $16.5 million.

   And last month, The Maven had been backing retired NBA star Junior
   Bridgeman’s bid to buy Sports Illustrated, but lost out on its chance
   to take over the whole operation when Bridgeman himself could not
   produce his portion of the financing to close the deal, sources said.
   ABG swooped in at the eleventh hour to land the deal instead.

   Levinsohn and Heckman had partnered on a number of media ventures in
   the past including at Yahoo where Levinsohn was an acting CEO and
   Heckman was an SVP in charge of media strategy and at Fox Interactive,
   where Levinsohn was president. [At the time, Fox was part of News Corp.
   which is the parent company of the NY Post]

   In a statement, Meredith said the deal will allow it to “devote full
   resources and management attention to maximizing the profitability of
   the rest of its portfolio of leading media brands,” which include
   People, Entertainment Weekly, Food + Wine and Travel + Leisure and
   Martha Stewart Living.

   Maven and ABG are pursuing discussions with Meredith for it to continue
   to operate certain aspects of the business, including print operations.
   However, Monday’s deal is not contingent on reaching such an agreement
   with Meredith, according to the SEC filing.

   Under the deal, ABG also gets stock warrants in the fledgling Maven
   company.

   Meredith appears to be sanguine about losing the publishing rights and
   said it only hung onto the publishing operation initially to speed
   along the much-delayed selloff process.

   “As a result of ABG’s decision to license the Sports Illustrated media
   assets to a third party — which was ABG’s right under the contract —
   Meredith’s goal of a completed transaction is achieved.”

   Still, Meredith is not entirely clear of SI. It is still shopping the
   blog site Fansided, which was added to SI when it still part of Time
   Inc. but which was left out of the May 27 deal between ABG and
   Meredith.

   Newsday is selling its freebie commuter paper amNewYork, relinquishing
   its last toehold in the five boroughs as it concentrates on its core
   Long Island audience.

   The sale to Schneps Media, a growing publisher of weekly newspapers and
   magazines in the New York area, is effective Oct. 11. Terms were not
   disclosed, but according to one source amNewYork was estimated to be
   losing about $5 million a year.

   Schneps, which was started by chairman and co-publisher Vicky
   Schneps-Yunis, started with the Queens Courier in 1985 and now
   publishes 33 weekly newspapers and 28 niche magazines across the metro
   area.

   Schneps has been on a shopping spree. In December, it purchased New
   York Family from Manhattan Media, and in September 2018 it purchased
   the Community News Group from the husband-and-wife team of Les and
   Jennifer Goodstein.

   It 2017, it purchased the weekly Long Island Press from Morey
   Publishing, which relaunched the long-defunct daily as a weekly.

   amNewYork was launched by Russel Pergament in 2003 and was aimed
   primarily at giving rail and subway commuters a quick, free read. But
   the retrenchment of retail cutting into its ad base and the
   connectivity of mobile phones on subway and commuter rail lines meant
   less reason to pick up a newspaper.

   It appears the new owner plans to keep it going.

   “We are looking forward to enhancing amNewYork’s brand through our
   expertise in multi-platform media including print, digital, events,
   social media and broadcasting platforms,” said Joshua Schneps, Schneps
   Media co-publisher and CEO.

   Debby Krenek, publisher of the Newsday Media Group — now a privately
   owned entity controlled by Patrick Dolan — said that the company will
   double down on its focus on Long Island as it pushes beyond print.

   “Moving forward, Newsday Media Group will fully focus on serving Long
   Islanders with news, information and experiences as we continue to
   expand our multimedia products and platforms and fulfill our mission of
   being the primary source of powerful local journalism as ‘Your Eye on
   LI’,” Krenek said.

   Newsday farmed out its printing to a New York Times plant in College
   Point and recently moved from its longtime headquarters on a former
   pasture in Melville into a new facility in an office park at 6
   Corporate Center Drive, also in Melville.

   "Hustlers" are making money off her story. Splash News; Steven Hirsch

   Six years ago, Samantha Barbash preyed on the wolves of Wall Street —
   now she wants to sink her teeth into J.Lo.

   The then-39-year-old brunette was the brains behind a ring of savvy
   strip club workers who bilked wealthy executives out of big bucks with
   a scam they had down to a steamy science.
   Barbash in an undated photo Barbash in an undated photoFacebook

   They took married guys to jiggle joints, drugged them and racked up
   tens of thousands of dollars on the guys’ credit cards.

   The escapades have inspired a movie that is being filmed in the Big
   Apple — with Jennifer Lopez playing the role of a curvy con artist
   inspired by Barbash.

   The flick, “Hustlers,” centers on a group of exotic dancers who band
   together to seek revenge on their rich and jerky clients.

   But Barbash isn’t happy about it.

   She told The Post she plans to sue the production company behind the
   flick, STX Entertainment, and the Bronx-bred pop diva-turned-movie
   star.

   “We’re putting a stop to it because she’s actually misrepresenting me,”
   Barbash, 45, said of J.Lo. “I was never a stripper. “It’s defamation of
   character.”

   Barbash, who worked as a hostess at Scores gentlemen’s club in Chelsea,
   said the team behind the flick failed to get permission to use her life
   rights.

   And J.Lo — who this week posted a bikini-clad photo of herself in
   character on Instagram — never bothered to contact her, either, Barbash
   said.

   “It’s my story she’s making money off of,” Barbash fumed. “If she wants
   to play me, then she should have gotten the real story.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   The true story may be wilder than fiction.

   Over a four-month period in 2013, a cunning quartet of exotic dancers
   and other strip club workers stole at least $200,000 from four affluent
   men. The duped dudes included a banker, doctor, real estate lawyer and
   hedge fund manager.

   To find their well-heeled marks, the women dressed in skimpy clothing
   and went “fishing” for men — ones wearing expensive suits and wedding
   rings — at upscale restaurants and hotel bars in Manhattan.

   I’m a hustler baby… I just want you to know… #Ramona on fire 🔥 On set
   and in character for #hustlersmovie #stxentertainment

   A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Mar 31, 2019 at 5:03am PDT

   One of the women, Karina Pascucci, then a 26-year-old brunette, flirted
   with the men and told them she was a nursing major. She invited them
   out for drinks on the town, where she’d meet up with Barbash and the
   other women.

   Barbash often took the men to RoadHouse NYC in Flushing or to Scores in
   Chelsea, where the women would arrange for a private room.

   At some point during the night, amid the dim lights and pulsing music,
   the vixens sprinkled MDMA or ketamine into the men’s drinks, causing
   some of them to black out. Throughout the night, the scheming ladies
   made sure to snap racy photos of the men at the clubs and in hotel
   rooms afterward.

   The sexy swindlers ran up thousands of dollars on the guys’ credit
   cards while they were drugged up, forging their signatures to buy
   bottles of champagne and expensive tequila — and tipping club workers
   generously. The club workers then gave the women a cut of the proceeds,
   which is standard practice for bringing in big spenders.

   Using the dough, one of the scammers, Roselyn Keo, bought a Cadillac
   Escalade. Some of the other women packed their closets with Gucci and
   Chanel threads and spent $1,000 on shoes, according to a New York
   Magazine article that inspired the movie “Hustlers.”

   “It sounds so bad to say that we were, like, drugging people. But it
   was, like, normal,” Keo, told the magazine in 2015.

   She confessed that the gals made it a point to screw over rich Wall
   Street horndogs who disrespected them or made sexually crude requests.

Comparing Jennifer Lopez to her real-life 'Hustlers' character

   She may have taken some liberties with her look.

   “That’s why I think we got greedy,” she admitted. “Because of the
   amount of stress we had to endure. We’re just like, ‘You know what —
   these people are f–king pissing me off. Just for that, I’m going to max
   out his credit card, like a penalty. You’re going to be left with a
   zero balance. Zero credit line. Just for being annoying,’ ” Keo told
   the magazine.

   “There’s something extra satisfying about persuading a man who thinks
   you’re trash to spend his time and money on you,” she said.

   “Preferably so much that in the end, they hate themselves. It’s like,
   ‘Who doesn’t have any self-respect now, motherf—er?’ ”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Most of the men awoke foggy-headed the next day, remembering little
   about the wild night.

   They sobered up quickly when they saw their credit card statements.
   When they demanded their money back from the women, the swindlers sent
   them threatening text messages, sometimes with incriminating or sexy
   photos.

   Other times, Barbash would turn on the charm.

   “You were so happy. Don’t you remember? You were tipping everyone,”
   Barbash told one of the guys, according to New York Magazine.

   Some of the men feared being outed to their wives and bosses, so they
   backed down.

   But not Zyad Younan. The New Jersey cardiologist eventually went to
   cops — and unraveled the scheme.

   When he learned through American Express he had supposedly run up a
   $135,000 tab at Scores in November 2013, he at first confronted
   Barbash. She tried sweet-talking him, saying in a November 2013 text
   message, “I thought you were a god? Why would you not wanna pay your
   bill?”

   A lawyer for one of the strip club workers later claimed Younan was
   trying to weasel out of the bill, chalking it up to “buyer’s remorse.”

   But Younan refused to back down, telling cops he had been drugged and
   conned — and police later learned he was right.

   His claims prompted an investigation and criminal indictment. In June
   2014, the scam came crumbling down as Barbash, Keo, Pascucci and Marsi
   Rosen were arrested on multiple counts of conspiracy, grand larceny,
   forgery and assault.

   Barbash pleaded guilty three years later and received five years’
   probation. Keo copped a plea in exchange for no jail time in March
   2016; Pascucci and Rosen were sentenced to weekends in jail for four
   months and five years of probation in January 2016. They pleaded guilty
   to conspiracy, grand larceny and other raps.

   When Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner asked her at a
   hearing if she had anything to say for herself, Barbash sniffed, “I’m
   glad this is done.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   These days, Barbash isn’t thrilled to be rehashing the ordeal.

   The movie “Hustlers” — which also stars Bronx
   stripper-turned-Grammy-award-winning rapper Cardi B and actress Julia
   Stiles — is based on a lie, she said.

   She claimed the magazine article that inspired the flick is “bogus” and
   said she plans to write her own book about the con.

   “They’re going off a false story,” Barbash said. “I was not a stripper.
   Everything — where [J-Lo] is going on poles and stuff — that’s not me.”

   Barbash, who now runs a spa, said she plans to meet with her lawyer to
   pursue legal action. “This is a living nightmare,” she said. “So now
   I’m going to have to do a lawsuit. I’m getting a gag order.”

   Her lawyer, Bruno Gioffre, added, “She is considering all legal avenues
   with the possibility injunctive relief, including a lawsuit.”

   It’s unlikely the movie will portray the world of New York City strip
   clubs accurately, said one source who worked with Barbash and the other
   women over the years.

   For example, a video of J-Lo pole-dancing in preparation for the role
   emerged online recently. But there were no poles at any of the clubs
   where the real women worked, the source said.

   “These girls never did pole-dancing, so if that’s in the movie, it’s a
   fairy tale,” he said — adding J-Lo isn’t believable in the role,
   either.

   “I don’t see how J-Lo, who is Miss Goodie Two Shoes, is gonna play
   [Barbash] realistically,” he said. “These were bad girls. They drugged
   and robbed people.

   “Some rich guys act like a– holes but I’ve never seen it where guys
   physically disrespect girls. So if that plays out in the movie, it’s
   not true.”

   Reps for the pop star did not return requests for comment.

   Patrick Parrotta, a lawyer who represented Pascucci, said he’s not
   surprised Hollywood wanted to portray the real-life drama.

   “[The story] does have all the right ingredients,” he said. “This is
   really a made-for-tv situation.”

   But he added that any “rational person that was involved as a criminal
   defendant would like it to fade into the sunset and not be brought up
   again and again.”

   But ultimately, Barbash said, she isn’t embarrassed.

   “It was a hard three years of my life. [But] I’m not ashamed,” she
   said.

   And she’s not afraid to take on powerful movie honchos.

   “They should have worked with me instead of against me,” she warned.

   Neither Lopez nor the production company immediately returned calls for
   comment.

   A judge Thursday sentenced a stripper to five years probation for her
   part in a ring that drugged wealthy clients, racked up huge bills on
   their credit cards and blackmailed them if they threatened to go to the
   police.

   Roselyn Keo, 31, previously copped to grand larceny and attempted
   assault as part of a no-jail plea deal.

Stripper says Wall Street dirtbags deserved to be drugged and robbed

   Rich Wall Streeters had it coming when they were swindled...

   “She’s ready to start rebuilding her life for her and her daughter,”
   said defense lawyer Samuel Gregory as Keo left Manhattan Supreme Court
   wearing Louboutin stilettos and a sweatshirt obscuring her face.

   Two of her cohorts Marsi Rosen, 29, and former Scores “massage” girl
   Karina Pascucci, 27, were sentenced to weekends in jail for four months
   and five years’ probation in January.

   The two copped to conspiracy, grand larceny and other raps as part of
   their agreement with prosecutors.

   on March 31.Steven Hirsch

   The scheme’s mastermind, Samantha Barbash, 41, has yet to be sentenced.

   The crew of brunette vixens trolled for their marks at fancy hotel bars
   then drugged their drinks, said the Office of the Special Narcotics
   Prosecutor.

   The compromised men were then driven to strip clubs and stripped of
   their credit cards, which the buxom beauties used to make thousands in
   charges.

   The ring was busted when Dr. Zyad Younan contacted authorities after
   Pascucci lured him to Scores in 2013 and racked up $135,000 worth of
   charges on his credit card.

   The strippers admitted to drugging the cardiologist and swiping his
   card to make fraudulent purchases for lap dances, liquor and tips.

   But Scores is still pursuing a lawsuit against him to collect on the
   hefty sum.

   Check out this teen temptress accused of targeting wealthy men and
   robbing them of their valuables:

   Busted massage girl Karina Pascucci leaves court after spending a
   weekend in jail as part of her sentencing in the crime ring.Steven
   Hirsch

   A massage girl who pleaded guilty to drugging wealthy strip-club
   clients and then running up tabs on their credit cards is clearly not
   enjoying her weekends in jail.

   Asked how she was doing as she walked out of Manhattan court Wednesday
   for a status conference on the first of her Saturdays and Sundays in a
   cell, pole dancer Karina Pascucci snapped at a reporter, “How do you
   think jail went?”

   “I have too much on my mind right now, I’d prefer not to speak about
   it,” Pascucci, 27, said outside Manhattan Criminal Court.

   She was tight-lipped, in contrast to her past interviews, such as the
   one she gave to “Crime Watch Daily” on WPIX/Channel 11 in October in
   which she claimed innocence, despite the guilty plea.

   She also told host Jason Mattera that she was the real victim of a
   jiggle-joint regular who refused to pay his giant tabs.

   “The girls knew him from before, and they knew he was a big spender,”
   she said, referring to New Jersey doctor Zyad Younan, who is suing
   Pascucci and Scores. “I think everybody should take responsibility for
   what happened.”

   Pascucci was a massage girl at gentlemen’s club Scores before she
   became part of the stripper ring that slipped clients tranquilizers and
   stole their credit cards, racking up bills as high as $135,000.

   The brunette is serving weekends in jail for the next four months as
   part of a plea bargain.

   Newsday is selling its freebie commuter paper amNewYork, relinquishing
   its last toehold in the five boroughs as it concentrates on its core
   Long Island audience.

   The sale to Schneps Media, a growing publisher of weekly newspapers and
   magazines in the New York area, is effective Oct. 11. Terms were not
   disclosed, but according to one source amNewYork was estimated to be
   losing about $5 million a year.

   Schneps, which was started by chairman and co-publisher Vicky
   Schneps-Yunis, started with the Queens Courier in 1985 and now
   publishes 33 weekly newspapers and 28 niche magazines across the metro
   area.

   Schneps has been on a shopping spree. In December, it purchased New
   York Family from Manhattan Media, and in September 2018 it purchased
   the Community News Group from the husband-and-wife team of Les and
   Jennifer Goodstein.

   It 2017, it purchased the weekly Long Island Press from Morey
   Publishing, which relaunched the long-defunct daily as a weekly.

   amNewYork was launched by Russel Pergament in 2003 and was aimed
   primarily at giving rail and subway commuters a quick, free read. But
   the retrenchment of retail cutting into its ad base and the
   connectivity of mobile phones on subway and commuter rail lines meant
   less reason to pick up a newspaper.

   It appears the new owner plans to keep it going.

   “We are looking forward to enhancing amNewYork’s brand through our
   expertise in multi-platform media including print, digital, events,
   social media and broadcasting platforms,” said Joshua Schneps, Schneps
   Media co-publisher and CEO.

   Debby Krenek, publisher of the Newsday Media Group — now a privately
   owned entity controlled by Patrick Dolan — said that the company will
   double down on its focus on Long Island as it pushes beyond print.

   “Moving forward, Newsday Media Group will fully focus on serving Long
   Islanders with news, information and experiences as we continue to
   expand our multimedia products and platforms and fulfill our mission of
   being the primary source of powerful local journalism as ‘Your Eye on
   LI’,” Krenek said.

   Newsday farmed out its printing to a New York Times plant in College
   Point and recently moved from its longtime headquarters on a former
   pasture in Melville into a new facility in an office park at 6
   Corporate Center Drive, also in Melville.
