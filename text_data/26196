   Arts, humanities, and social sciences publication ethics research
   New! COPE Study exploring publication ethics issues in arts,
   humanities, and social sciences

   In early 2019 COPE, with the support of Routledge (part of the Taylor &
   Francis Group), commissioned primary research with Shift Learning to
   better understand the publication ethics landscape for editors working
   on journals within the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Editors
   told us which issues they find most prevalent, most serious and those
   they felt least confident dealing with.
