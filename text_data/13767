5 Iconic Paver Patterns You Can DIY

   By Mandi | 08/02/2019 | 4 Comments

   Installing a paver patio is a big undertaking. It‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs a
   lot of physical labor, and it‚Äôs semi permanent. All of the ingredients
   that make up a really intense DIY project right!?

   When we decided to install the Pavestone Plank pavers at the Granary, I
   dove deep into picking the perfect pattern.

   One of the reasons that I chose to use the Plank pavers is because I am
   obsessed with the dimensions. Traditional pavers have a 1:2 dimension
   ratio, meaning they are twice as long as they are wide. But the plank
   pavers have a 1:3 ratio, which makes them elongated and a IMHO little
   more special.

   There are 5 iconic ways to install rectangular pavers (or tile, or
   boards, or whatever rectangular material makes your heart sing) and
   we‚Äôre going to talk through all 5! I mean, you are basically living
   with this patio for the next 10-60 years, and you dont want to screw it
   up. (No pressure!)

1/3 Offset Paver Pattern

   The 1/3 Offset pattern is made by offsetting each tile‚Äôs edge 1/3 of
   the way across the previous row. Basically if you divide a tile in
   3rds, that is where the rows of edges should repeatedly hit.

Straight Stacked Paver Pattern

   A Straight Stacked or Straight Lay pattern is made by squarely lining
   the pavers up row by row. This will give your paver patio a modern
   vibe.

Herringbone Paver Pattern

   Herringbone pavers are usually set at a 45 degree angle and individual
   pavers alternate the direction they are rotated. Herringbone pavers
   will give your space a timeless and fun vibe! You can read all about
   our herringbone paver patio here!

Basket Weave Paver Pattern

   A Basket Weave pattern is made when pavers are laid net to each other
   to form a square. The following pavers are also laid in a square but in
   the opposite direction. The basket weave pattern pictured above is made
   out of 3 pavers, because of their 1:3 ratio. You can also make this
   pattern with 2 or more pavers, just keep in mind that they‚Äôll have to
   have an even ratio to make a square! This style will give you a cool
   mid-century vibe, especially if you are using more than 2 pavers per
   square!

Running Bond Paver Pattern

   You see this pattern all over Pinterest, think subway tile! When
   something is laid in a running bond it means that the center of each
   tile is lined up with the edge of the tile above and below it. It‚Äôs a
   little less busy that the 1/3 Step and will give you a traditional
   courtyard feel. This was my second favorite for the Granary!

   I‚Äôm dying to know, which one do you love the most!? If you use any of
   these patterns at your house make sure to share pictures, I can‚Äôt wait
   to see it!


Herringbone Paver Patio at The Granary!

   By Mandi | 08/01/2019 | 17 Comments

   I am so excited for you guys to finally see the patio at the Granary!
   We partnered with Home Depot and Pavestone to tackle this patio paver
   project. I had high hopes that we could tackle it in a weekend, but per
   the usual, our undertaking was full of Merc Perks and went from a 2 day
   project, to a much much longer timeline.

   Before we dive too deep into the how to, let‚Äôs have a quick recap shall
   we?! We‚Äôve got so much going on around here that its easy to feel
   confused about where, and how, and why. (Feel free to skip ahead if
   you‚Äôre well versed in the Merc saga!)

   When we bought the Merc it had some extremely funky property issues.
   Things like an incredibly intrusive easement, to the simple reality
   that the building itself was the property line (yayyyyyy). It almost
   made it so that we didnt buy it, but me being the eternal optimist knew
   in my heart of hearts that it was going to all work out. So 18 months
   ago we made an offer to our neighbor and bought a portion of his
   property, which included the historic Santa Clara Tithing Granary.
   Learn all about that here!

   The Granary is a small building that we‚Äôre going to be turning into a
   studio airbnb. We‚Äôve still got so much to do to it (electricity!
   plumbing!) but our game plan is to great this great space where people
   can come and stay. Earlier this year we turned the back patio into an
   outdoor seating/dining area and this paver project tackled the front.
   So we feel like progress is happening!

   This is where we started:

Bottom Watering Your Plants (Ever Heard of It!?)

   By Mandi | 07/02/2019 | 2 Comments

   Watering can be one of the trickiest parts of plant parenthood. How
   much is too much!? How much is too little!? What happens if I get it
   wrong?! OMG THE PRESSURE!!

   Dude. I get it!! Taking care of plants the way that they want to be
   taken care of can be intense- especially if you are raising Treenagers
   like a Fiddle Leaf Fig. They can be SO dramatic!

   Today I‚Äôm going to teach you all about Bottom Watering, it‚Äôs great for
   people who have a big question mark when it comes to the right way to

   to handle it. üòÇ
