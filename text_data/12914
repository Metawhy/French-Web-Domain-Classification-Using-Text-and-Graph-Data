Review: Sabo Optical Center Punch

   The Guys at SOBA kindly sent me an optical center punch to try for an
   up and coming CNC Z Axis project.
   [Sabo+Optical+Center+Punch.JPG]
   If  your not familiar with optical center punches ,think of it as a
   normal metal marking punch with a sniper scope attached.
   [whats+in+the+mail+brain+box.png]
   Over a normal metal center punch this bit of kit may seem a bit over
   the top. One of the catches with making an accurate CNC machine is the
   fact you need another CNC machine to make it.
   This is where this particular center punch will come in extremely handy
   why? for very accurate marking before drilling the various holes.This
   wont be much of a review more if an overview.

Gnat Stats, Tiny OLED PC Performance Monitor ESP8266

   Juris Perkons,  contacted me to say he had successfully ran Gnat Stats
   on the ESP8266 by following a guide by KikDiy on YouTube.

   Unfortunatley KikDiy's video guide is not in english but he has links
   to the code in the description.
   Thanks for sharing, Juris :)
