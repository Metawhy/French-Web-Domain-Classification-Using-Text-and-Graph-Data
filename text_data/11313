Studies and reports on violence against women

   Violence Against Women (VAW) is a global problem affecting many women
   and girls worldwide. VAW is often culture and context specific and has
   many individual and societal implications. Yet, there are similarities
   in the dynamics of VAW across all cultures. The documents included in
   this section highlight these differences and similarities and present
   information about the global prevalence and forms of VAW, as well as
   its costs and consequences. Here the documents are arranged by studies
   and reports that are global in nature and those that have a regional
   focus. Regional studies and reports were available for only some
   regions. For example, studies from Africa non-conflict regions were not
   available. Also included here are studies and reports of VAW in
   conflict-affected areas, although it is important to note that VAW that
   are unrelated to conflict also exists in these areas and must not be
   overlooked.
   Global scope

   gbv_strategy_cover2.png The Executive Order on Preventing and
   Responding to Violence Against Women and Girls Globally of 2012 worked
   to enhance efforts to advance the rights and status of women and girls,
   to promote gender equality in U.S. foreign policy, and to bring about a
   world in which all individuals can pursue their aspirations without the
   threat of violence. The order creates an interagency working group
   co-chaired by the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the U.S.
   Agency for International Development (USAID), and directs departments
   and agencies to implement the new United States Strategy to Prevent and
   Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally (August 2012).

Violence Against Women and Girls in the Post-2015 Framework: Why and How

   post-2015 international framework should tackle it.

   is also provided on women's responses. Available in English, French,
   and Spanish.

Towards Ending Violence Against Women in South Asia

   This paper describes VAW in South Asian context. It discusses the
   policy initiatives made internationally and how these policies have
   yielded little action in this region. Core challenges in addressing VAW
   in this region are discussed and suggestions are offered for way ahead.
   Focus on Europe

PROTECT: Identifying and Protecting High Risk Victims of Gender Based
Violence - an Overview

   This report summarizes project PROTECT which aims at contributing to

Taking Stock: A review of the existing research on trafficking for sexual
exploitation

   exploitation to and within Europe, giving an overview of and insight

   and discusses a primary theme in the trafficking research: the
   definition and use of the trafficking concept; methods for
   data-collection and analysis; perspectives on and explanations of human
   trafficking; and challenges and knowledge needs in designing
   counter-trafficking measures.
   Focus on Latin America and the Caribbean

Ending Violence Against Women Globally: International policies, programs, and
approaches

   round colorful quilt
   Published
   August 01, 2012
   Author(s)
   Sheetal Rana

   This special collection brings together selected documents that focus
   on international policies, programs, and approaches to prevent and
   intervene in violence against women (VAW). The goal is to facilitate
   learning about different polices, programs, and approaches that have
   been developed, adopted, and adapted internationally to address VAW in
   diverse cultural and socio-economic situations. The review of documents
   included in this special collection suggests the following: First,
   there are limited multi-country studies on VAW. Second, human rights
   declarations and conventions set international legal standards for
   policy and program responses to VAW. Third, international initiatives
   have focused on VAW prevention by addressing gender inequalities in
   several development sectors, particularly justice, health, and
   education. Fourth, many approaches to prevent and intervene in VAW use
   social-ecological framework and engage community members, including
   men. Fifth, little is known about programs that have proven effective
   in ending VAW across countries because there is limited rigorous
   evaluation of programs that address VAW.

   The special collection is organized into six sections, and the
   documents included cover multi-country projects, policies, and studies.
   Important to note here is that this special collection is not a
   comprehensive listing of all documents available; rather, it includes
   selected documents that are available online free of charge. Studies on
   VAW in the U.S. are not included in this special collection, but can be
   found elsewhere on VAWnet.

   This collection was developed by Sheetal Rana of the Minnesota Center
   Against Violence and Abuse.

from Programme Interventions

   The review analyzed data from 58 evaluation studies of interventions

   using the following categories: gender-neutral - programs that
   distinguish little between the needs of men and women, neither
   reinforcing nor questioning gender roles; gender-sensitive - programs
   that recognize the specific needs and realities of men based on the
   social construction of gender roles; or gender-transformative -
   approaches that seek to transform gender roles and promote more
   gender-equitable relationships between men and women.

   for use with groups of men and women.
