   The National Popular Vote bill would guarantee the Presidency to the
   candidate who receives the most popular votes across all 50 states and
   the District of Columbia. Explanation. It has been enacted into law in
   16 jurisdictions with 196 electoral votes (CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, HI, IL,
   MA, MD, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA). See map. The bill will take effect
   when enacted by states with 74 more electoral votes. The bill has

   Republican-controlled Arizona House and a 28–18 in
   Republican-controlled Oklahoma Senate, and been approved unanimously by
   committee votes in two additional Republican-controlled states with 26
