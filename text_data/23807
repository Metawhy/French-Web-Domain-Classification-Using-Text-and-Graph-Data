Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)

   CORSIA

   CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International
   Aviation, addresses the increase in total CO2 emissions from
   international aviation above 2020 levels.

   CORSIA’s obligations have already started. As of 1 January 2019, all
   carriers are required to report their CO2 emissions on an annual basis.

   The aviation industry is committed to technology, operational and
   infrastructure advances to continue to reduce the sector's carbon
   emissions. Offsetting is not intended to replace these efforts. Nor
   would the CORSIA make fuel efficiency any less of a day-to-day
   priority.

   It is forecast that CORSIA will mitigate around 2.5 billion tonnes of
   CO2 and generate over USD 40 billion in climate finance between 2021
   and 2035.

   Download our factsheet on CORSIA (pdf) and our paper on aviation and
   carbon offsetting (pdf) for more detailed information.

   The 2019 IATA AGM has reaffirmed the industry support for the CORSIA
   scheme.  Michael Gill, Director of Aviation Environment, talks about
   the resolution that was discussed in Seoul.
   ​

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgyaOAsB6Zk?wmode=transparent


Carbon Offsetting

   Offsetting is an action by a company or individual to compensate for
   their emissions by financing a reduction in emissions elsewhere.
   Offsetting and carbon markets are a fundamental component of global,
   regional and national emissions reduction policies. They have operated
   for decades for compliance purposes and voluntary emissions reductions
   and continue to be an effective mechanism to underpin action against
   climate change.

Environmental integrity

   There are many ways to achieve CO2 reductions that can be used as
   offsets, many of which bring other social, environmental or economic
   benefits relevant to sustainable development. Such offsets can be
   sourced from various types of project activities, including, for
   example, wind energy, clean cook stove, methane capture and other
   emissions-reducing or avoidance projects.

   To ensure the environmental integrity of CORSIA, ICAO will adopt a list
   of emissions units that can be used for compliance. The decision will
   be guided by eligibility criteria (link to emissions unit criteria) to
   guarantee that emissions units deliver the desired CO2 reductions.
   The criteria are based on principles commonly applied under existing
   trading mechanisms and well-accepted carbon offset certification
   standards.

   See also IATA's position on the avoidance of double counting under
   CORSIA (pdf).

Environmental impact of CORSIA

   CORSIA is a global scheme. As a result, CORSIA will overall result in a
   greater CO2 mitigation in international aviation than any domestic
   policy for aviation can achieve. It is forecast that CORSIA will
   mitigate around 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 between 2021 and 2035, which
   is an annual average of 164 million tonnes of CO2. This represents an
   investment of about USD40 billion in climate projects (assuming that
   the price of carbon will increase from USD8 in 2021 to USD20 in 2035).

A multilateral approach

   On 27 June 2018, ICAO adopted the international Standards and
   Recommended Practices (SARPs) for CORSIA as Annex 16, volume IV, to the
   Chicago Convention (link). The adoption of global standards for
   CORSIA will ensure the necessary level of uniformity in regulations
   which our industry needs. Uniformity is not only key to prevent market
   distortions, but also to preserve the environmental integrity of
   CORSIA.

   Whilst emissions from domestic aviation are subject to country-specific
   actions and therefore fall under the scope of the UN Framework
   Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, ICAO was mandated
   to address emissions from international flights.

   International cooperation, including in addressing environmental
   impacts, is critical for a sector like aviation. This is why, in the
   Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, states committed to
   collaborate in securing the highest practicable degree of uniformity in
   regulations and bring their domestic regulations in line with the
   international standards adopted by ICAO in Annexes to the Chicago
   Convention.

Avoiding the patchwork

   In order to avoid a patchwork of uncoordinated regional and domestic
   policies for international aviation, political agreement for CORSIA was
   achieved on the condition that CORSIA would be the only market-based
   measure applied to international flights and on the basis that
   emissions should not be accounted for more than once.

   Unfortunately, the success of CORSIA may be jeopardized by the
   national policies of some states. Of particular concern is that some
   states are applying or considering the application of a carbon pricing
   instrument or ticket tax to address emissions from international
   aviation, on top of CORSIA. Such policies are not only against the
   international commitments of these states, they also undermine
   multilateral efforts to deal with climate change and put at stake the
   credibility of the global approach, potentially compromising the
   international support for CORSIA at a critical time for its
   implementation.

   See our factsheet on CORSIA and carbon pricing (pdf).

Guidance materials & support

   Under CORSIA, all operators with annual emissions greater than 10,000
   tonnes of CO2 will have to report their emissions on an annual basis,
   with monitoring starting from 1 January 2019 (international flights
   only). Resources are provided below to assist operators comply with
   CORSIA.

Stay informed

   Please let us know if you wish to stay informed about CORSIA and
   receive regular updates on new capacity-support activities and
   materials. To sign up, please send us a brief message
   at corsia@iata.org.

Airline Handbook on CORSIA

   The IATA Airline Handbook on CORSIA is intended to provide information
   to airlines on the main elements of CORSIA and on requirements to
   comply with the scheme.

   Download the IATA Airline Handbook on CORSIA: 3rd edition, revised,
   November 2018 (pdf).

   You will also find additional guidance on CORSIA in the ICAO
   Environmental Technical Manual. It can be consulted on the ICAO website
   (link).

Sample emissions monitoring plans

   In order to help operators with the preparation of their emissions
   monitoring plan, we have put together a few sample emissions monitoring
   plans for fictional airlines. Please note that, ultimately,
   the template and the level of information to be included will depend on
   the expectations of the administrating authorities. Also, the sample
   emisisons monitoring plans are provided for illustration only and
   procedures which are suitable for one operator may not be appropriate
   for another operator.

   Download the overview and introductory document (pdf).

   Download the sample emissions monitoring plans: Alpha Airlines (pdf),
   Charlie Airways (pdf), Juliet Wings (pdf).

   The standardized template for the emissions monitoring plans can be
   downloaded from the ICAO website (link).

FRED+

   IATA has launched FRED+, an easy-to-use and intuitive platform to
   support and facilitate CO2 emissions reporting for aircraft
   operators and states.  FRED+ is fully aligned and compatible with the
   CORSIA MRV requirements. The use of the platform is available free of
   charge to all aeroplane operators (including operators which are not
   IATA members) and administrating authorities. More information can be
   found on the dedicated FRED+ Webpage.
   IATATabContent3

CORSIA Workshops

   In 2019, IATA conducted a series of workshops to help operators prepare
   for the verification of their emissions data and the submission of
   their emissions report in early 2020. Through presentations and
   interactive group discussions, participants went through the main
   requirements under CORSIA and the potential risks related to the
   collection and reporting of fuel data.

   interconnected air transport system to traffic  illegal flora and
   fauna. Aviation is committed to playing its part in stopping
   this illegal trade in wildlife, worth at least $19 billion annually.

   Although the duty for capturing and prosecuting these criminals rests
   with national enforcement authorities, airline staff can provide an
   important source of additional intelligence.

   IATA is working with the aviation industry to support the work of
   enforcement agencies in combating the illegal trade in wildlife.​​​​

United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce

   From airlines to shipping lines – the United for Wildlife (UfW)
   Transport Taskforce aims to jointly examine the role of the transport
   industry in the illegal wildlife trade and aims to identify ways the
   sector can break the chain between suppliers and consumers.

   The 2016 IATA Annual General Meeting unanimously endorsed
   a resolution denouncing the illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife
   products and pledging to partner with government authorities and
   conservation organizations in the fight against the
   trafficking of protected species.

   IATA is among the signatories to the UfW Transport Taskforce Buckingham
   Palace Declaration which aims to reduce the illegal trade of
   wildlife. 61 airlines have also signed up as well as a number of other
   aviation stakeholders, underlining the aviation industry’s commitment
   to helping end this evil trade.

Aircraft Noise

Shrinking footprints

   As a result of technological improvements, the noise footprint of new
   aircraft is at least 15% smaller than that of the aircraft they
   replace.

   Since the first ICAO international standards for aircraft noise were
   adopted in 1971, certification standards have periodically been made
   more stringent. In 2014, ICAO adopted a new standard that will result
   in a reduction of 7 Effective Perceived Noise Decibels (EPNdB) compared
   to the current Chapter 4 Standard. The new standard will apply from
   2018.

Noise problems need tailor-made solutions

   In 2001, the ICAO Assembly unanimously endorsed the ICAO Balanced
   Approach to Aircraft Noise Management by adopting Resolution A33-7. The
   core principle of the Balanced Approach is that the noise situation at
   each airport is unique and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
   The ICAO Balanced Approach therefore requires that all available
   options be evaluated in order to identify the most suitable measure or
   combination of measures to mitigate a specific noise problem.

Operating restrictions: a last resort

   The ICAO Balanced Approach identifies four elements to address
   noise around airports: reduction at source, land-use management and
   planning, noise abatement operational procedures, and operating
   restrictions.

   Operating restrictions are measures that limit or reduce access to an
   airport. In view of the impact they may have on airlines, passengers
   and local economies, operating restrictions should not be introduced as
   a first resort but only after a full assessment of all available
   measures to address a demonstrated noise problem at an airport.

   Night flights are critical for express delivery services, the transport
   of mail and time-sensitive products.

Local Air Quality

Limiting engine emissions through technology

   Emissions from aircraft engines that affect air quality are nitrogen
   oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur oxides (SOx), unburned
   hydrocarbons (HC), smoke and particulate matter (PM). Improved engine
   designs have gradually reduced the emissions of NOx and CO and have
   almost completely eliminated emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HC)
   and smoke.

Certification standards for engine emissions

   Aircraft engines have to meet mandatory certification requirements
   established by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection.
   ICAO has adopted certification standards for NOx, CO, HC and smoke. A
   certification requirement for non-volatile particulate matter is under
   development.

A comprehensive approach

    Aircraft are not the only or even the main source of local emissions
   around airports. Their contribution is relatively small compared to
   emissions from road traffic and other ground activities. Therefore, all
   sources must be considered in order to reduce total emissions. Measures
   should include, for instance, clean and efficient surface access to
   airports.

   Emissions from aircraft are relatively small compared to other sources

Airline Cabin Waste

   Airlines recognize the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling
   cabin waste from their flight operations to reduce their environmental
   footprint.

   Passengers are increasingly worried about the impact of single-use
   plastics on the marine environment, governments are focusing on
   minimizing food waste, and airlines are concerned that the regulatory
   system inhibits their ability to respond to these challenges.

   In the absence of smarter regulation, cabin waste volumes could double
   in the next 10 years. IATA wants to support the simplification and
   harmonization of cabin waste regulations and promote technical
   solutions that will reduce industry costs and contribute to the
   circular economy.
   ​What is cabin waste? ​IATA's activities ​Frequently Asked Questions
   IATATabContent1

​Cabin waste is made up of two main streams:

Cleaning Waste

   Cleaning waste is leftover rubbish from items given to passengers on
   the aircraft such as newspapers, paper towels, plastic bottles, food
   dropped on the floor, amenity kits and plastic wrapping from blankets,
   pillows and headsets. Cleaning waste also includes the contents of
   washroom bins and medical waste such as used syringes.

Catering (galley) waste

   Catering waste comes from inflight meals, snacks and beverages served
   to passengers and can consist of leftover food, drinks and packaging
   which is placed back in the trolleys, in static or compactor bins. This
   waste can contain high volumes of liquid from unconsumed beverages and
   ice.
   ​​​​ ​​​​ ​

   All cabin waste is subject to national waste management controls that
   limit pollution, but many countries have gone further with their
   regulations, introducing restrictions on catering waste
   from international flights to protect their agricultural sector (in
   respect to animal health). Airline meals are prepared using
   stringent hygiene and quality control standards, originally designed
   for NASA astronauts, but the regulations often lead to the incineration
   of all cabin waste with limited ability to reuse and recycle.

What IATA is doing

Analysis of waste composition

   Because cabin waste is collected and managed by two different
   contractors (cleaners and caterers), undertaking a holistic cabin waste
   composition analysis is challenging for airlines. A standard cabin
   waste audit methodology was developed and tested at London's Heathrow
   Airport in a pilot study in 2012 and 2013. The study indicated that a
   typical passenger generated 1.43 kilos of cabin waste (average across
   both short and long-haul international flights) of which 23% was
   untouched food and drink and a further 17% comprised of recyclable
   materials (e.g. plastic bottles and newspapers).

A case for smarter regulation

   A major obstacle to airlines' ability to reuse and recycle more
   cabin waste is the International Catering Waste (ICW) legislation that
   many governments have adopted. These regulations aim to reduce the risk
   of transferring animal and plant diseases by requiring ICW to be
   subject to special treatment.

   IATA commissioned a study to understand the risks posed
   by airline catering waste on animal health. It advocates the adoption
   of smarter regulation which allows recycling while maintaining animal
   health controls. Read the summary of International catering waste: A
   case for smarter regulation (pdf).

​Frequently Asked Questions

   1. Is there any data on cabin waste volumes?

   Very limited data exists on cabin waste volumes. Cabin waste is handled
   by both cleaning and catering companies who often serve multiple
   airlines at an airport and have no means of segregating and monitoring
   waste.  IATA undertook a cabin waste audit at London’s Heathrow airport
   back in 2012 and 2013 which indicated that a typical passenger
   generates 1.43 kilos of cabin waste per flight. This is an average
   across both short and long-haul international flights from different
   airlines. Airlines are undertaking cabin waste audits and we are
   encouraging them to share the results.

   2. How do airlines manage cabin waste?

   Airlines do not collect, store or dispose of cabin waste themselves.
   This is performed by contractors – cleaners and caterers – on their
   behalf. All cabin waste is subject to national waste management
   controls that limit pollution, however many countries have gone further
   with their regulations and require catering waste from international
   flights to be incinerated, sterilized or subject to deep landfill
   burial in order to minimize risks to their agricultural sector.

   3. What are airlines doing to reduce the cabin waste from their
   flights?

   Airlines are initiating many waste reduction activities (including buy
   onboard, meal selection at check-in, inflight amenity kits on request)
   and recycling where regulations allow. The Aviation: Benefits Beyond
   Borders website highlights some of these activities.

   4. What are the main challenges for airlines in relation to this topic?

   Airlines face many challenges related to cabin waste:
     * Restrictive regulations based on protection of the agricultural
       sector (in respect to animal health)
     * Cabin waste costs are not visible in service contracts
     * Lack of awareness on cabin waste volumes and composition
     * Lack of airport infrastructure with cabin waste recycling
       facilities
     * Lack of stowage onboard for segregated waste
     * Complex interrelationships with key stakeholders involved including
       manufacturers, airports, cleaning and catering companies, waste
       management companies and regulators

   5. What's IATA's role in reducing cabin waste?

   IATA is sharing best practices with its airlines, catering companies,
   airports and regulators including guidance, recommended practices and
   handbooks. IATA is producing a handbook that promotes a holistic
   approach to cabin waste management, detailing clear and concise actions
   that airlines can take. IATA also commissioned a study that advocates
   for the adoption of smarter regulation which would allow reuse and
   recycling while maintaining animal health controls.

   6. How are current regulations influencing this issue?

   All cabin waste is subject to national waste management controls that
   limit pollution, but many countries have gone further with their
   regulations, introducing restrictions on catering waste
   from international flights to protect their agricultural sector (in
   respect to animal health). These restrictive legislations preclude the
   reuse and recycling of airline meals and cabin products from
   international flights. For example, many countries deem milk and dairy
   products served in airline meals to be of high risk which prevents
   disposable beverage cups from being recycled. IATA's research indicates
   that there is no scientific justification for these restrictive
   measures.

   7.  How can aviation stakeholders contribute to reducing cabin waste?
     * Manufacturers need to include waste and recycling segregation as a
       design option included in cabin layouts
     * Airports need to provide recycling facilities and infrastructure
       that promotes improved cabin waste performance including monitoring
       results and sharing cost savings
     * Catering companies should ensure their facilities support reuse and
       recycling, including the ability to donate food and monitor results
       of cabin waste performance with airlines
     * Cleaning contractors can implement standard operating procedures
       that include the segregation of reusables and recyclables

   8. Why do animal health regulations prevent airlines from reusing and
   recycling cabin waste?

   A significant number of countries have introduced restrictive
   regulations on the disposal of catering waste from international
   flights which mean that any reusable or recyclable products,
   contaminated or perceived to be contaminated, with animal products is
   deemed biohazardous. Many regulators and service providers deem all
   waste generated from an international flight to be a potential source
   of agricultural disease, precluding reuse and recycling. IATA is
   engaging with regulators around the world to educate them on industry
   catering procedures with an aim of promoting reuse and recycling
   without compromising agricultural health.

   9. What is the main risk for animal health associated with
   international air travel?

   Airline meals are prepared using stringent hygiene and quality control
   standards. Although not specifically focused on animal health, these
   controls minimize the spread of human diseases. Of greater concern, is
   the widespread concealment of animal and plant products in passenger
   baggage, for example, a study in Switzerland (pdf) estimated that up to
   1500 tonnes of illegal bushmeat were smuggled into two international
   airports in one year.

   10.  How can passengers help?

   Your active participation is essential:
    1. Don't put waste in seatback pockets
    2. Refuse food, beverages and inflight products that you know you
       won't use
    3. Pre-order meals where possible
    4. Support airline recycling initiatives onboard
    5. Write to your regulator
    6. Do not smuggle animal and plant products in your bags

   11. Can I access data on cabin waste?

   Unfortunately, IATA does not hold airline specific cabin waste data
   however we are urging airlines to share the data they collect both in
   terms of type and amount of waste but also on the costs associated with
   waste management.
