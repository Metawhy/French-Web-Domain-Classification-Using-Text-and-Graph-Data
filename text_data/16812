   Last modified: September 18th, 2014

   We at Big Fish Games, Inc. ("Big Fish") have created this Cookie Policy
   to explain what cookies are, why we use them, and how you can manage
   their use.

WHAT ARE COOKIES?

   Cookies are small text files which are sent to your browser and are
   placed on your computer or device when you visit a website. When you
   visit a website again, the cookie allows the website to recognise your
   browser.

   If you are located in the European Union, you were given the
   opportunity to consent to cookies as you entered our website (to get
   this far you have already either consented or been directed to this
   policy via our cookie banner). Cookies are useful because they help us
   make your website experience more enjoyable. They allow us to recognise
   your device (e.g. your laptop or mobile device) so that we can tailor
   your experience of our website. For more information about cookies, we
   recommend you visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?

   Cookies do lots of different jobs on this website, such as letting you
   navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences,
   remembering your username and password, enabling you to keep goods in
   your shopping cart, letting us analyse how well our website is
   performing, and improving your experience. They also help ensure that
   adverts you see whilst you are on our website and other websites are
   more relevant to you and your interests.

WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?

   We want you to understand the different types of cookies that we use on
   our website. Some of these cookies are essential to the operation of
   our website. Others are not essential, but help to improve our website
   by collecting anonymous user information, or try and improve your
   experience of our website by remembering your choices. We also use
   cookies which collect information about your browsing habits so that we
   and our third party service providers can try and display advertising
   which is relevant to you and your interests.

   Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:

Category 1 - strictly necessary cookies:

   We use a number of cookies which are essential to the operation of this
   website and which enable services you have specifically asked for to be
   provided. For example, these types of cookies let us identify account
   holders and ensure they can access the member-only areas of this
   website, enable our website to remember the goods that you add to your
   shopping cart, provide the necessary security your visit to our website
   requires, and help ensure the content of the pages you request load
   quickly. Without these cookies, services that you have asked for cannot
   be provided.

   We want you to understand these essential cookies, and why we use them,
   but your consent is not required for us to use them on our website as
   we use these cookies only to provide you with services that you have
   requested.

Category 2 - performance cookies:

   These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website,
   for example, where our visitors have come from, which of our pages our
   visitors go to most often, and if visitors get error messages on those
   pages. These performance cookies do not collect information that
   identifies you as an individual – all information they collect is
   aggregated and anonymous – however, if you have a registration account
   with us, the information collected by us using performance cookies may
   be associated with your registration account. The information gathered
   is only used to improve how our website works.

   In addition, the coding language our website is written in uses session

   you don't have to reset your preferences each time you visit us.

   discussion in a forum or provide enhanced services such as enabling you
   to view a video on our website.

Category 4 - targeting or advertising cookies:

   These cookies track your browsing habits so that we can show you
   advertising which we hope is relevant to your interests. We believe it
   is useful to show you advertisements that are tailored to your
   interests. These advertising cookies use information about your web
   browsing activity to group you with other users who have similar

   Information about your browsing habits is passed by us to third party
   advertisers so that you are shown more tailored advertisements when you

   These types of cookies are also used to limit the number of times you
   see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of
   advertising campaigns.
