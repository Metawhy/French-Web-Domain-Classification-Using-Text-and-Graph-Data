The Political Philosophy of Dominic Cummings and the Funding of the Brexit
Project.

   [john-simkin.jpg]

   Dominic Cummings was forced to look on from the sidelines as the
   government, headed by Theresa May, failed to negotiate a way out of the
   European Union. According to his blog posts it would all be so
   different if he was in charge. Cummings is a great fan of the
   mathematician, John Von Neumann, and On the Theory of Parlour Games
   (1928). Cummings quotes Von Neumann as saying: "Chess is not a game.
   Chess is a well-defined computation. You may not be able to work out
   the answers, but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure
   in any position. Now, real games are not like that at all. Real life is
   not like that. Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of
   deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I
   mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory."

   John Simkin

   In September, 1997, Spartacus Educational founder and managing director
   John Simkin became the first educational publisher in Britain to
   establish a website that was willing to provide teachers and students
   with free educational materials.

   According to a survey carried out by the Fischer Trust, Spartacus
   Educational is one of the top three websites used by history teachers
   and students in Britain (the other two are BBC History and the Public
   Record Office’s Learning Curve). The Spartacus Educational website
   currently gets up to 7 million page impressions a month and 3 million
   unique visitors.

   As well as running the Spartacus Educational website John Simkin has
   also produced material for the Electronic Telegraph, the European
   Virtual School and the Guardian's educational website, Learn. He was
   also a member of the European History E-Learning Project (E-Help), a
   project to encourage and improve use of ICT and the internet in
   classrooms across the continent.

   We have published six e-books, Charles Dickens: A Biography (October,
   2012), First World War Encyclopedia (October, 2012), Assassination of
   John F. Kennedy Encyclopedia (November, 2012), Gandhi: A Biography
   (December, 2012), The Spanish Civil War (December, 2012) and The
   American Civil War (December, 2012). He also contributed an article to
   the recently published book, Using New Technologies to Enhance Teaching
   and Learning in History (December, 2012).

   Alfred Adler Alfred Adler

   In 1910 Alfred Adler published The Psychological Hermaphroditism in
   Life and in the Neurosis where he explained the inferiority complex in
   great detail.

   "The feeling of inferiority whips up... the instinctual life,
   excessively intensifies wishes, gives rise to over sensitivity, and
   produces a craving for satisfaction that will not tolerate
   compromise... In this hypertrophied craving, in this addiction to
   success, in this wildly behaving masculine protest lie the seeds of
   failure - though also the predestination for genial and artistic
   achievements."

   Sigmund Freud wrote to Carl Jung about how he was worried about the
   development of Adler's theories. "It is getting really bad with Adler.
   You see a resemblance to Bleuler; in me he awakens the memory of
   Fliess; but an octave lower... The crux of the matter - and that is
   what really alarms me - is that he minimizes the sexual drive and our
   opponents will soon be able to speak of an experienced psychoanalyst
   whose conclusions are radically different from ours. Naturally in my
   attitude toward him I am torn between my conviction that all this is
   lopsided and harmful and my fear of being regarded as an intolerant old
   man who holds the young men down, and this makes me feel most
   uncomfortable."

   Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud

   Sigmund Freud had very few patients during the first few years of his
   married life. His first patient was suffering from depression and Freud
   prescribed electrical treatment. He also gave lectures to young doctors
   on a wide variety of topics, including clinical neurology and medical
   uses of electricity. Freud took a close interest in Charcot's "latest
   investigations upon hysteria... He had proved, for instance, the
   genuineness of hysterical phenomena and their conformity to laws... the
   frequent occurrence of hysteria in men, the production of hysterical
   paralyses and constructures by hypnotic suggestion."

   In the autumn of 1892 Ilona Weiss became one of Freud's patients. To
   protect her identity, Freud always referred to her as "Elisabeth von
   R". The twenty-four year old daughter of a wealthy Hungarian family was
   suffering from pains in the legs and had difficulty in walking. Her
   doctor had examined her and could not find anything physically wrong
   with her legs and decided she was suffering from hysteria and she was
   sent to Freud. He decided to use a different method to treat her. Freud
   asked Elisabeth to lie down on his couch and close her eyes. Applying
   pressure to her forehead, he asked her to report faithfully whatever
   came into her mind.
