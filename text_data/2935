Halloween DIY Project

   Simple DIY projects are so fun using Jillbean Soup cut files and a
   variety of surfaces. Jillibean Soup offers a ton of fun surfaces for
   your home décor projects. Today I used the 8x10 diagonal plank to
   create this Cute Halloween sign. I often make signs using vinyl as a
   stencil but instead I wanted to show how vinyl works on different
   surfaces. Then once I made one project, I just couldn’t stop there so I
   turned a glass cookie jar into the perfect container for my Halloween
   candy and a silver tray into a fun serving piece.

Create Today Shiplap Frame

   Looking to add inspiration to your crafting space? Add a Shiplap Frame,
   black & white palette and a creative message, yes please. Here are the
   steps to create your own. First the Create letters were spray painted
   black and set aside to dry.  Then once dry the letters were added to
   the shiplap frame as shown using E6000 glue. Last the foam stickers
   were added to the bottom right corner of the frame, I chose the heart
   and the “today”.  Talk about quick and easy, it doesn’t get much better
   than that. That is it, hang and enjoy. The possibilities are endless
   when it comes to our surfaces mixed with our foam stickers- check them
   out when you get a chance.

How to Stitch on a Layout

   Hello everyone! This is Maryám and today I am here with you to share
   some ideas on how To Stitch on a Layout.

   One of my favorite techniques is to add hand stitching to my layouts.
   It could be just a little circle or an entire piece. I find it so
   relaxing and of the coolest things about this technique is that you can
   do several tasks at a time, for example, watch a series on Netflix
   while you stitch. Awesome, right?!

   Scrapbook layout using Jillibean Soup's Rainbow Roux, You Make Miso
   Happy, Spoonful of Soul, and a cut file. How to stitch on a layout.

   #scrapbooklayout #stitch #rainbowroux #spoonfulofsoul #youmakemisohappy
   #cutfile

   For today’s project, I used the Heart Wreath Cut File. It is such a
   beautiful design, and as you may have seen before, some of the girls
   from the Design Team have already used it, and I also wanted to feature
   in today’s layout but in a slightly different way.

   #cutfile

   To create this really fun effect on my cut file, I started by sketching
   the design using my Silhouette Cameo. After that, with the help of a
   paper piercer tool, I punch some holes all the way around the heart
   wreath. Once I finish with that, I went ahead a pull out some
   embroidery thread that coordinated with the Rainbow Roux collection and
   organized them in rainbow order.

   #cutfile

   After some hours stitching, I finish the piece, fussy cut around it,
   and took some coordinating liquid watercolors and added some more fun
   to the page.

   #cutfile

   Since I spent so many hours stitching the heart wreath, I decided to
   keep it as the main focus of my layout and add just a few simple
   embellishments here and there.

   Supplies:
   Jillibean Soup:
   Patterned Paper:  Rainbow Roux/Tad of Imagination; Bite Size
   Bits/Garden Harvest,
   Pea Pod Parts: Rainbow Roux
   Coordinating Stickers: You Make Miso Happy, Spoonful of Soul, Garden
   Harvest.
   Epoxy Stickers: Rainbow Roux
   Tag: Oh Snap
   Shaker Filler: Sequins/ Pinks, Oranges, Blues, Greens
   Silhouette Cut File: Hearth Wreath #245641

   Other: Embroidery Thread, Paper Piercer Tool, Foam Dots, Glue Dots,
   White Cardstock, Silhouette Cameo, Typewriter.

   Thank you for stopping by today. Hope you enjoyed the post. If you have
   any questions, please let me know in the comments below.

   Have a great day!

Free Cut File: Summer Collapsed Into Fall

   This week we have a cut file to help close up summer and move on to
   fall. There always seems to be that day when it just flips the switch
   and it's no longer summer.

   I’ve created an easy striped watercolor background for my challenge
   card. You don’t need much for this technique — a brush (1/2-inch flat
   works great, but a round brush would work too), watercolor paper, and
   either some watercolor paints or a dye ink pad.

   I like to paint my middle stripe first and then just eyeball the
   spacing after that. After I finished my stripes, I added some splatter.
   Once everything was dry, I layered some diecuts to create my floral
   cluster and sentiment and finished off with some Spoonful of Soul Epoxy
   Stickers.

   Supplies:
   Jillibean Soup:
   Pea Pod Parts: Spoonful of Soul
   Epoxy Stickers: Spoonful of Soul

   Other:  Scattered Straw and Mustard Seed Distress Ink, 1/2-inch flat
   watercolor brush, watercolor paper, opaque white paint, vellum,
   Papertrey Ink leaf die.

   Hi Jillibean Soup friends, Happy World Card Making Day!  Hopefully you
   are carving out some time today to celebrate the occasion by making a
   card or two.  If that’s the case, I hope you’ll join in on my challenge
   to create and find inspiration in a monochromatic design.

   Start off by selecting your color palette.  Pink is my very favorite,
   so I naturally chose that.  I gathered some of my favorite pink
   patterned papers, floral Pea Pod Parts from a variety of collections
   and a stamp set or two to fill in the gaps.

   Normally, I would never pair all of these shades of pink together, but
   when using a monochromatic palette they totally work!

   I started by creating the landscape.  I chose two shades of green
   patterned paper for the landscape and some navy blue for the sky.
   Just a few wavy cuts with scissors creates a rolling landscape.. a
   perfect suburban setting for the little houses.

   Details make all the difference when making a scene.  Little leaf pea
   pod cuts become trees, a doily makes a sunny sky. I even fussy cut a
   little path to the front door of the home in the forefront.

   The houses are added with adhesive foam tape to add dimension to the
   scene.  A little heart helps make it clear that this is a home- not a
   house.  And this card is perfect for welcoming a new neighbor, or to
   congratulate the new home owner in your life.

Favorite Family Memory Documented

   Hey Jillibean Soup Friends! It’s Leanne here today sharing a layout of
   one of our favorite family memories.

   Jillibean Soup_Leanne Allinson_Family Memory LO_01c

   For me, when I document, I like to capture the everyday sentiment of
   the moment. Of course I also capture the magical and special moments,
   but it is the memories like these, ones that could just slip by
   unobtrusively, that appeal to my heart.

   What I love about the Jillibean Soup patterned paper collections is the
   ease in which these papers can be used.  On this layout I have used
   Garden Harvest to not only color match with my photo, but to make
   subtle connections with the story behind it.

   and the Garden Harvest collection including patterned papers, pea pod
   parts, and foam stickers. Favorite fall memory documented. Jillibean
   Soup scrapbooker. #jillibeansoup #scrapbooker #scrapbooklayout
   #gardenharvest #spoonfulofsoul

   The foam sticker title is perfect for added dimension and to draw the
   eye towards the photo. This title says a lot about the implied
   tradition that this photo represents.

   parts, and foam stickers. Favorite fall memory documented. Jillibean
   Soup scrapbooker. #jillibeansoup #scrapbooker #scrapbooklayout
   #gardenharvest #spoonfulofsoul

   On this layout I have included a lot of fussy cutting. The flower
   wreaths are aligned vertically down the page to create a border on
   which the photo becomes anchored to the page. The phrases in the frames
   have also been fussy cut. The phrases and images in the fussy cut
   frames, relate back to the family memory I have documented. A simple
   white cardstock, die cut tag with journaling typed onto it, is tucked
   under the photo. Color matching embroidery thread is stapled directly
   to the layout base.

   Finally, for extra dimension, I added foam tape to the pea pod parts
   butterflies and scattered epoxy stickers among the fussy cut layers.

   Supplies:

   Patterned Paper: Garden Harvest/Plow the Fields, Water the Goods,

   Other: embroidery thread, staples, cardstock, black paint, black
   archival pen, tag metal die, foam tape.
