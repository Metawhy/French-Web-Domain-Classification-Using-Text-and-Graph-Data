   Welcome to the website of the 46th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles
   of Programming Languages (POPL 2019).

   The annual Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages is a forum
   for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and
   programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are
   welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience
   reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring
   contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation or
   application of programming languages.

   The symposium is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM
   SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.

   POPL 2019 and its co-located events took place at the Hotel Cascais
   Miragem, Cascais, Portugal, January 13–19, 2019.
