My Instagram Access Token keeps expiring

   If your feed has previously been displaying just fine then randomly
   seems to stop working, it is most likely due to your access token
   expiring.

   You can get a new access token by using the big blue button on the
   “Configure” tab.

   bigbluebutton

   We’ve received mixed reports of the frequency of the expiration of
   Instagram Access Tokens. Most tokens very rarely expire and never need
   to be renewed, but a few users have reported their token expiring every
   few days. All that Instagram’s documentation says is “Access tokens may
   expire at any time in the future.”.

   Facebook Groups are making their long-awaited return to v3.9 of the
   Custom Facebook Feed Pro plugin! You can now display timeline posts,
   events, videos, and albums from groups that our app is added to. See

Instagram API Changes – April 4, 2018

   Due to some sudden changes that Instagram has made to their API on
   April 4th, 2018, some features of our Instagram Feed plugin will no
   longer be available. We apologize for any frustration or inconvenience
   this has caused.  Unfortunately, Instagram gave no warning that these
   changes would be coming into effect, and they affect all Instagram
   plugins.

How will these changes affect the Instagram Feed plugin?

   User Feeds
   It is still possible to display your own Instagram account, however,
   Instagram has removed the ability to display user feeds from other
   Instagram accounts which are not your own. You can only display the
   user feed of the account which is associated with your Access Token,
   but it is no longer possible to display someone else’s feed using your
   own Access Token.

   Liked Feeds
   It is no longer possible to display “Liked” feeds – which is a feed of
   posts that your user has liked.

   Public Comments
   It is possible to display comments on your own user feeds, but it is no
   longer possible to display comments on posts in hashtag or location
   feeds.

   Avatars
   It is no longer possible to display the avatars of users in hashtag or
   location feeds.

   We have released an update to our Instagram Feed plugin to reflect
   these unforeseen changes, and apologize again for any inconvenience
   they might have caused.



   Facebook Groups are making their long-awaited return to v3.9 of the
   Custom Facebook Feed Pro plugin! You can now display timeline posts,
   events, videos, and albums from groups that our app is added to. See
   here for more info: smashballoon.com/display-facebook-group-feed/

   out the oven! This update includes a backup caching system - so even if
   there's an issue with Facebook your feed won't go down, and also a new
   way to easily manage multiple page/group accounts on one site. Full
