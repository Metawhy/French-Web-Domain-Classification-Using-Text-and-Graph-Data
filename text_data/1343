   IEEE collects the following personal data in line with the use purposes
   explained in a subsequent section:

   - Your name and contact details
   - Date of birth
   - Online profile data/usage
   - Emergency contact information
   - Social media profile information
   - Copies of identification documents
   - Education and professional information
   - Communication information including IEEE Online Support and Contact
   Center communications
   - Purchasing and payment information
   - Registration and participation in IEEE events and activities
   - Subscription preferences
   - Information about the device(s) you use
   - Information about service usage
   - Cookies
   - Authentication data
   - Location information
   - Author and peer review information
   - Other information you upload or provide to us


   How do we use your information?

   IEEE uses (and, where specified, shares) your personal information for
   the following purposes:
   To process transactions. IEEE uses personal information such as name,
   physical address, telephone number, email address, and
   company/institution to engage in interactions with you, including
   contacting you about your order, donation, subscription, event
   participation, or membership. We use financial/credit card and payment
   information to process your order and may need to share some of this
   information with delivery services, credit card clearing houses, and
   other third parties to complete the transaction.
   To provide support or other services. IEEE may use your personal
   information to provide you with support or other services that you have
   ordered or requested. IEEE may also use your personal information to
   respond directly to your requests for information, including
   registrations for newsletters, webinars, or other specific requests, or
   pass your contact information to the appropriate IEEE distributor or
   reseller for further follow-up related to your interests.

   To provide information based on your needs and respond to your
   requests. IEEE may use your personal information to provide you with
   notices of new product releases and service developments.

   To provide online forums and social networks. Some services available
   on the websites permit you to participate in interactive discussions,
   post comments, opportunities, or other content to a bulletin board or
   exchange, or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these
   services are moderated; all may be accessed for technical reasons (for
   example, for improvements or fixes). IEEE does not control the content
   that users post to these forums or social networks. You should
   carefully consider whether you wish to submit personal information to
   these forums or social networks and tailor any content you submit
   appropriately and in accordance with the relevant terms of use. You
   should also review any additional terms and conditions that may govern
   your use of these services, including terms related to sharing your
   personal information and receiving communications.
   To administer products. IEEE may contact you if you purchase products
   to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you
   did not experience problems in the download process). We may also use
   this information to confirm compliance with licensing and other terms
   of use and may share it with your company/institution.
   To select content, improve quality, and facilitate use of the
   websites. IEEE may use your personal information, including the
   information gathered as a result of site navigation and electronic
   protocols and cookies (including third-party cookies), to help create
   and personalize website content, improve website quality, track
   marketing campaign responsiveness, evaluate page response rates,
   conduct usability testing, and facilitate your use of the websites (for
   example, to facilitate navigation and the login process, avoid
   duplicate data entry, enhance security, keep track of shopping cart
   additions, and preserve order information between sessions).
   To serve personalized advertising to you. We don't share your
   information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers
   to choose the characteristics of users who will see their
   advertisements, and we may use any of the non-personally-identifiable
   attributes we have collected to select the appropriate audience for
   those advertisements. When you click on or otherwise interact with an
   advertisement, there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a
   cookie in your browser and that your attributes meet the criteria the
   advertiser selected.

   To assess usage of IEEE products and services. IEEE may track your
   usage of IEEE products and services (e.g., IEEE Xplore) to determine
   your level of usage, and those usage statistics may be made available
   to IEEE’s content licensors and your company/institution.
   To communicate with you about a meeting, conference, or event. We may
   communicate with you about a meeting, conference, or event hosted or
   co-sponsored by IEEE or one of our business associates. This may
   include information about the event's content, event logistics,
   payment, updates, and additional information related to the event.
   Information you provide when registering for or participating in a
   conference managed or co-sponsored by parties, other than or in
   addition to IEEE may be shared with those parties, and the treatment of
   such information is further subject to the privacy policies of those
   parties. IEEE and its conference co-sponsors may contact you after the
   event about the event, subsequent iterations of the event and related
   events. Please note that IEEE conference, meeting or event organizers,
   co-sponsors, exhibitors, and other third parties may directly request
   your personal information at their conference booths or presentations.
   Providing your information to them is optional, and you should review
   their privacy policies to address your particular needs and concerns
   about how they will treat your personal information.

   To consider you for a higher member grade or an IEEE award. IEEE may
   use personal information such as your name, education, work history,
   and volunteer activities to consider you for a higher member grade or
   for an IEEE award. IEEE may need to share this information with your
   nominators, references, judges, and others parties involved in
   evaluating your eligibility.
   To include you in IEEE Member Directories. If you are an active member
   of IEEE, one of its Societies, or IEEE Standards Association, at your
   request, we may include your information in IEEE Member Directory in
   IEEE Collabratec, and, if applicable, the Fellows Directory and IEEE
   Society Directories. We may also enable private member to member
   messaging (your email address is never shared). Active members can
   customize their member directories visibility preferences any time in
   account settings.
   To document standards development participation. If you are a
   participant in IEEE standards development, IEEE uses your personal
   information to comply with policies and procedures, legal and
   accreditation requirements, and evaluation of patent claims by patent
   offices. IEEE must capture your personal data for these purposes, and
   provides information about activities related to standards development
   groups in which you participate. IEEE standards development
   participation is documented through various methods, e.g., rosters,
   submission documents, email reflectors, records of meeting attendance,
   responses to ballots, publicly available participation lists, and
   declaration of affiliations.
   To assist in your participation in IEEE activities. IEEE will
   communicate with you, if you are participating in certain IEEE
   activities such as IEEE conferences, authoring or reviewing an IEEE
   periodical article, or IEEE humanitarian activities. IEEE may send you
   information such as newsletters related to those activities.

   To update you on relevant IEEE benefits, programs, and
   opportunities. IEEE may communicate with you regarding relevant IEEE
   benefits, programs, and opportunities available to you, through your
   membership(s) with IEEE.

   To engage with third parties. IEEE may share your personal data with
   third parties in connection with services that these individuals or
   entities perform for or with IEEE. These third parties are restricted
   from using this data in any way other than to provide services for IEEE
   or for the collaboration in which they and IEEE are contractually
   engaged (for example, hosting an IEEE database or engaging in data
   processing on IEEE’s behalf, or mailing you information that you
   requested). These third parties are carefully selected by IEEE and
   obligated to keep your data secure. From time to time, we may also
   share your information with third parties whom we think might provide
   content, products, or services of interest to you.
   To protect IEEE content and services. We may use your information to
   prevent potentially illegal activities and to enforce our terms and
   conditions. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect
   and address anomalous activity and to screen content to prevent abuse,
   such as spam. These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or
   permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users

   To get feedback or input from you. In order to deliver products and
   services of most interest to our customers, from time to time, we may
   ask members, customers, volunteers, and website visitors to provide us
   input and feedback (for example through surveys, usability studies,
   focus groups).

   To protect IEEE information assets as well as your own personal
   data. The IEEE Information Security Program protects the
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IEEE information assets
   by following a risk management approach based on policies, standards,
   guidelines, and procedures to meet security objectives while supporting
   business and operational goals.


   How can you control your information?

   You can control the information we have about you and how we use it in
   several ways.
     * If you are a registered user, you can review, revise, and correct
       the personal data that you have provided to IEEE via IEEE
       Account/MyProfile.
     * Use the unsubscribe method provided in our various communications


   Personal data about minors and children

   IEEE does not knowingly collect data from or about children under 16
   without the permission of parent(s)/guardian(s). If we learn that we
   have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will
   delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we
   might have any information from or about a child under age 16, please
   contact us.


   How will you know if the Privacy Policy is changed?

   IEEE may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any
   material changes we will notify you by email if you have an IEEE
   Account, or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change
   becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page
   for the latest information on our privacy practices.

   Technical and regulatory information

   Logging practices

   IEEE automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of
   visitors. The IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer
   on the internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect
   to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you
   have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance,
   the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be
   deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections,
   your IP address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated
   with your personal computer.

   As well as recording the IP addresses of users, IEEE may also keep
   track of sites that users visited immediately prior to visiting IEEE's
   website and the search terms they used to find it. We keep track of the
   pages visited on IEEE's website, the amount of time spent on those
   pages and the types of searches done on them. Your searches remain
   confidential and anonymous. IEEE uses this information only for
   statistical purposes to find out which pages users find most useful and
   to improve the website.

   IEEE also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may
   include:
     * Browser/Device type/version
     * Operating system used
     * Media Access Control (MAC) address
     * Date and time of the server request
     * Volume of data transferred


   External links behavior

   Some of IEEE's websites link to other sites created and maintained by
   other public- and/or private-sector organizations. IEEE provides these
   links solely for your information and convenience. When you transfer to
   an outside website, you are leaving the IEEE domain, and IEEE's
   information management policies no longer apply. IEEE encourages you to
   read the privacy statement of each external website that you visit
   before you provide any personal data.


   Cookies and web beacons

   Cookies and web beacons are electronic placeholders that are placed on
   your device by websites to track your individual movements on that
   website over time. IEEE uses both session-based cookies (which last
   only for the duration of the user's session) and persistent cookies
   (which remain on your device and provides information about the session
   you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again).

   These cookies and web beacons provide useful information to IEEE,
   enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to
   and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance
   the usage of our websites on all IEEE web servers.

   Tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as
   web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable
   non-core functionalities on the IEEE website and enable third-party
   functions (such as a social media "share" link). We may also include
   web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages
   to determine whether the messages have been opened.


   Do Not Track (DNT)

   The online advertising industry has self-regulatory initiatives
   designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see
   online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by
   some or all of the companies participating in these programs. Our
   websites do not respond to DNT consumer browser settings.


   Collaboration with authorities

   IEEE has appointed and mandated a privacy officer who represents the
   regulatory authorities inside the IEEE organization, and in return
   represents the IEEE organization to regulatory authorities.

   The IEEE privacy officer will ensure proper communication with the
   relevant regulatory authority for privacy. The privacy officer will
   lead investigative action, complaint handling and data breach
   notification. The privacy officer will also monitor regulatory changes
   and consult the regulatory authority where implementation of a
   regulatory or technological change leads to doubt.


   Transfer of information to other countries

   As a global organization, IEEE engages in a number of international
   activities.  In connection with the management of those activities,
   IEEE may transfer information to other countries. By submitting your
   information to IEEE via the websites, or in connection with your
   interactions with IEEE offline, you consent to such transfers and to
   the processing of this information in other countries.


   Responses to legal requests

   IEEE reserves the right to share your information to respond to duly
   authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where
   required by law.

   In the event of bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale
   of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that
   transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your
   information as transferred to the new entity.


   Your European Union privacy rights

   Under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 2016/679)
   (also known as GDPR), if you are an individual protected by the GDPR
   you may have certain rights as a data subject.  To request information
   about or avail yourself of those rights, please send an email to
   privacy@ieee.org with "GDPR Request" in the subject line. In the email
   please describe, with specificity, the GDPR right you are requesting
   assistance with.  Please note additional information may be requested
   prior to initiation of a request and that IEEE reserves the right to
   charge a fee with respect to certain requests.  Upon IEEE’s completion
   of its review you will be notified if your request has been granted,
   denied, or exemptions apply.


   Your California privacy rights

   Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as S.B. 27), if
   you are a California resident and your business relationship with IEEE
   is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may
   request certain data regarding IEEE’s disclosure, if any, of personal
   information to third parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing
   purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to
   privacy@ieee.org with "Request for California Privacy Information" in
   the subject line. You may make such a request up to once per calendar
   year. If applicable, we will provide you, by email, a list of the
   categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for their
   direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar
   year, along with the third parties' names and addresses. Please note
   that not all personal information sharing is covered by S.B. 27's
   requirements.


   How do I contact you if there is an issue?

   If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or
   about the use of your personal information, please feel free to contact
   us by email at privacy@ieee.org.

   ordered or requested. IEEE may also use your personal information to
   respond directly to your requests for information, including
   registrations for newsletters, webinars, or other specific requests, or
   pass your contact information to the appropriate IEEE distributor or
   reseller for further follow-up related to your interests.

   To provide information based on your needs and respond to your
   requests. IEEE may use your personal information to provide you with
   notices of new product releases and service developments.

   To provide online forums and social networks. Some services available
   on the websites permit you to participate in interactive discussions,
   post comments, opportunities, or other content to a bulletin board or
   exchange, or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these
   services are moderated; all may be accessed for technical reasons (for
   example, for improvements or fixes). IEEE does not control the content
   that users post to these forums or social networks. You should
   carefully consider whether you wish to submit personal information to
   these forums or social networks and tailor any content you submit
   appropriately and in accordance with the relevant terms of use. You
   should also review any additional terms and conditions that may govern
   your use of these services, including terms related to sharing your
   personal information and receiving communications.
   To administer products. IEEE may contact you if you purchase products
   to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you
   did not experience problems in the download process). We may also use
   this information to confirm compliance with licensing and other terms
   of use and may share it with your company/institution.
   To select content, improve quality, and facilitate use of the
   websites. IEEE may use your personal information, including the
   information gathered as a result of site navigation and electronic
   protocols and cookies (including third-party cookies), to help create
   and personalize website content, improve website quality, track
   marketing campaign responsiveness, evaluate page response rates,
   conduct usability testing, and facilitate your use of the websites (for
   example, to facilitate navigation and the login process, avoid
   duplicate data entry, enhance security, keep track of shopping cart
   additions, and preserve order information between sessions).
   To serve personalized advertising to you. We don't share your
   information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers
   to choose the characteristics of users who will see their
   advertisements, and we may use any of the non-personally-identifiable
   attributes we have collected to select the appropriate audience for
   those advertisements. When you click on or otherwise interact with an
   advertisement, there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a
   cookie in your browser and that your attributes meet the criteria the
   advertiser selected.

   To assess usage of IEEE products and services. IEEE may track your
   usage of IEEE products and services (e.g., IEEE Xplore) to determine
   your level of usage, and those usage statistics may be made available
   to IEEE’s content licensors and your company/institution.
   To communicate with you about a meeting, conference, or event. We may
   communicate with you about a meeting, conference, or event hosted or
   co-sponsored by IEEE or one of our business associates. This may
   include information about the event's content, event logistics,
   payment, updates, and additional information related to the event.
   Information you provide when registering for or participating in a
   conference managed or co-sponsored by parties, other than or in
   addition to IEEE may be shared with those parties, and the treatment of
   such information is further subject to the privacy policies of those
   parties. IEEE and its conference co-sponsors may contact you after the
   event about the event, subsequent iterations of the event and related
   events. Please note that IEEE conference, meeting or event organizers,
   co-sponsors, exhibitors, and other third parties may directly request
   your personal information at their conference booths or presentations.
   Providing your information to them is optional, and you should review
   their privacy policies to address your particular needs and concerns
   about how they will treat your personal information.

   To consider you for a higher member grade or an IEEE award. IEEE may
   use personal information such as your name, education, work history,
   and volunteer activities to consider you for a higher member grade or
   for an IEEE award. IEEE may need to share this information with your
   nominators, references, judges, and others parties involved in
   evaluating your eligibility.
   To include you in IEEE Member Directories. If you are an active member
   of IEEE, one of its Societies, or IEEE Standards Association, at your
   request, we may include your information in IEEE Member Directory in
   IEEE Collabratec, and, if applicable, the Fellows Directory and IEEE
   Society Directories. We may also enable private member to member
   messaging (your email address is never shared). Active members can
   customize their member directories visibility preferences any time in
   account settings.
   To document standards development participation. If you are a
   participant in IEEE standards development, IEEE uses your personal
   information to comply with policies and procedures, legal and
   accreditation requirements, and evaluation of patent claims by patent
   offices. IEEE must capture your personal data for these purposes, and
   provides information about activities related to standards development
   groups in which you participate. IEEE standards development
   participation is documented through various methods, e.g., rosters,
   submission documents, email reflectors, records of meeting attendance,
   responses to ballots, publicly available participation lists, and
   declaration of affiliations.
   To assist in your participation in IEEE activities. IEEE will
   communicate with you, if you are participating in certain IEEE
   activities such as IEEE conferences, authoring or reviewing an IEEE
   periodical article, or IEEE humanitarian activities. IEEE may send you
   information such as newsletters related to those activities.

   To update you on relevant IEEE benefits, programs, and
   opportunities. IEEE may communicate with you regarding relevant IEEE
   benefits, programs, and opportunities available to you, through your
   membership(s) with IEEE.

   To engage with third parties. IEEE may share your personal data with
   third parties in connection with services that these individuals or
   entities perform for or with IEEE. These third parties are restricted
   from using this data in any way other than to provide services for IEEE
   or for the collaboration in which they and IEEE are contractually
   engaged (for example, hosting an IEEE database or engaging in data
   processing on IEEE’s behalf, or mailing you information that you
   requested). These third parties are carefully selected by IEEE and
   obligated to keep your data secure. From time to time, we may also
   share your information with third parties whom we think might provide
   content, products, or services of interest to you.
   To protect IEEE content and services. We may use your information to
   prevent potentially illegal activities and to enforce our terms and
   conditions. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect
   and address anomalous activity and to screen content to prevent abuse,
   such as spam. These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or
   permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users

   To get feedback or input from you. In order to deliver products and
   services of most interest to our customers, from time to time, we may
   ask members, customers, volunteers, and website visitors to provide us
   input and feedback (for example through surveys, usability studies,
   focus groups).

   To protect IEEE information assets as well as your own personal
   data. The IEEE Information Security Program protects the
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IEEE information assets
   by following a risk management approach based on policies, standards,
   guidelines, and procedures to meet security objectives while supporting
   business and operational goals.


   How can you control your information?

   You can control the information we have about you and how we use it in
   several ways.
     * If you are a registered user, you can review, revise, and correct
       the personal data that you have provided to IEEE via IEEE
       Account/MyProfile.
     * Use the unsubscribe method provided in our various communications


   Personal data about minors and children

   IEEE does not knowingly collect data from or about children under 16
   without the permission of parent(s)/guardian(s). If we learn that we
   have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will
   delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we
   might have any information from or about a child under age 16, please
   contact us.


   How will you know if the Privacy Policy is changed?

   IEEE may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any
   material changes we will notify you by email if you have an IEEE
   Account, or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change
   becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page
   for the latest information on our privacy practices.

   Technical and regulatory information

   Logging practices

   IEEE automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of
   visitors. The IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer
   on the internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect
   to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you
   have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance,
   the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be
   deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections,
   your IP address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated
   with your personal computer.

   As well as recording the IP addresses of users, IEEE may also keep
   track of sites that users visited immediately prior to visiting IEEE's
   website and the search terms they used to find it. We keep track of the
   pages visited on IEEE's website, the amount of time spent on those
   pages and the types of searches done on them. Your searches remain
   confidential and anonymous. IEEE uses this information only for
   statistical purposes to find out which pages users find most useful and
   to improve the website.

   IEEE also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may
   include:
     * Browser/Device type/version
     * Operating system used
     * Media Access Control (MAC) address
     * Date and time of the server request
     * Volume of data transferred


   External links behavior

   Some of IEEE's websites link to other sites created and maintained by
   other public- and/or private-sector organizations. IEEE provides these
   links solely for your information and convenience. When you transfer to
   an outside website, you are leaving the IEEE domain, and IEEE's
   information management policies no longer apply. IEEE encourages you to
   read the privacy statement of each external website that you visit
   before you provide any personal data.


   Cookies and web beacons

   Cookies and web beacons are electronic placeholders that are placed on
   your device by websites to track your individual movements on that
   website over time. IEEE uses both session-based cookies (which last
   only for the duration of the user's session) and persistent cookies
   (which remain on your device and provides information about the session
   you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again).

   These cookies and web beacons provide useful information to IEEE,
   enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to
   and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance
   the usage of our websites on all IEEE web servers.

   Tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as
   web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable
   non-core functionalities on the IEEE website and enable third-party
   functions (such as a social media "share" link). We may also include
   web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages
   to determine whether the messages have been opened.


   Do Not Track (DNT)

   The online advertising industry has self-regulatory initiatives
   designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see
   online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by
   some or all of the companies participating in these programs. Our
   websites do not respond to DNT consumer browser settings.


   Collaboration with authorities

   IEEE has appointed and mandated a privacy officer who represents the
   regulatory authorities inside the IEEE organization, and in return
   represents the IEEE organization to regulatory authorities.

   The IEEE privacy officer will ensure proper communication with the
   relevant regulatory authority for privacy. The privacy officer will
   lead investigative action, complaint handling and data breach
   notification. The privacy officer will also monitor regulatory changes
   and consult the regulatory authority where implementation of a
   regulatory or technological change leads to doubt.


   Transfer of information to other countries

   As a global organization, IEEE engages in a number of international
   activities.  In connection with the management of those activities,
   IEEE may transfer information to other countries. By submitting your
   information to IEEE via the websites, or in connection with your
   interactions with IEEE offline, you consent to such transfers and to
   the processing of this information in other countries.


   Responses to legal requests

   IEEE reserves the right to share your information to respond to duly
   authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where
   required by law.

   In the event of bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale
   of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that
   transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your
   information as transferred to the new entity.


   Your European Union privacy rights

   Under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 2016/679)
   (also known as GDPR), if you are an individual protected by the GDPR
   you may have certain rights as a data subject.  To request information
   about or avail yourself of those rights, please send an email to
   privacy@ieee.org with "GDPR Request" in the subject line. In the email
   please describe, with specificity, the GDPR right you are requesting
   assistance with.  Please note additional information may be requested
   prior to initiation of a request and that IEEE reserves the right to
   charge a fee with respect to certain requests.  Upon IEEE’s completion
   of its review you will be notified if your request has been granted,
   denied, or exemptions apply.


   Your California privacy rights

   Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as S.B. 27), if
   you are a California resident and your business relationship with IEEE
   is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may
   request certain data regarding IEEE’s disclosure, if any, of personal
   information to third parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing
   purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to
   privacy@ieee.org with "Request for California Privacy Information" in
   the subject line. You may make such a request up to once per calendar
   year. If applicable, we will provide you, by email, a list of the
   categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for their
   direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar
   year, along with the third parties' names and addresses. Please note
   that not all personal information sharing is covered by S.B. 27's
   requirements.


   How do I contact you if there is an issue?

   If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or
   about the use of your personal information, please feel free to contact
   us by email at privacy@ieee.org.
