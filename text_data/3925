APR : Algorithms, Programs and Resolution

   Scientific leader : Antoine Miné

   The APR (Algorithms, Programs and Resolutions) team belongs to the the
   Computer Science Laboratory LIP6.

   The APR team works on thematics dealing with algorithms and programming
   languages, from both theo- retical and practical aspects, combining the
   language approach and the algorithmic requirements in a wide range of
   applications, such as programing new machine architectures, developing
   languages for concurrence and mobility, software testing, static
   analysis. More generally, in the APR team, we develop formal and
   mathematically founded methological approaches, in the domains of
   semantics and combinatorics, in order to achieve concrete goals such as
   experimental software prototypes, as well as development of industrial
   applications.

   Research thematics are more precisely described in the research page.
