Pre-departure Orientations for Secondary Schools

   Join us on September 26 at 2:00 p.m. EDT for a text-based Q&A session
   with colleagues from the field. Secondary school pre-departure
   orientation (PDO) programs have many things in common with university
   level PDOs. However, additional information needs to be covered as the
   participants are often minors under the legal age of 18. This mandates
   that for all intents and purposes they are under the care of the
   faculty or administrator leading the education abroad experience.
   Additionally, due to the significance of leading minors out of the
   country, the audience for the PDO must include not only

Privacy Policy

   SHARE

   NAFSA: Association of International Educators (NAFSA) is committed to
   building user trust and confidence by promoting, and complying with,
   business practices that help protect the privacy of our customer and
   user data. This Privacy Policy covers all information collected by
   NAFSA.

   NAFSA has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you, or if you
   represent an entity or other organization, that entity or organization,
   (in either case,"you," "your," or "User") our practices regarding the
   personal information that NAFSA collects, uses, and shares. This
   includes information used by our iMIS association management system
   (AMS), the NAFSA websites (including Network.NAFSA online networking,
   surveys, job board, Adviser's Manual 360, and e-learning), the
   Experient registration system, the annual conference mobile
   application, and the eventBit tracking system. Hereafter, these various
   technologies will be known as the NAFSA "Platform."

   NAFSA reserves the right, at any time, to modify this Privacy Policy.
   If we make revisions that change the way we collect, use, or share
   personal information, we will post those changes in this Privacy
   Policy. You should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you
   keep up to date on our most current policies and practices. We will
   note the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at
   the end of this Privacy Policy.

   Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand NAFSA’s views
   and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat
   it. By visiting this Platform, you are freely accepting and consenting
   to the practices in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent
   at any time and for any reason with effect to future data processing by
   contacting us at the address listed below in the Section titled
   "Communications." Without your consent, NAFSA will use personal
   information, only insofar as such processing is permitted by applicable
   law (e.g., for the performance of a contract or agreement between NAFSA
   and you) or where such processing is necessary for compliance with a
   legal obligation to which NAFSA is subject.

Collection of Personal Information

   Through your interactions with NAFSA, NAFSA collects “personal
   information,” which is information that identifies an individual or
   relates to an identified individual. Non-personal information means
   information that does not directly identify an individual. We collect
   both types of information about you.

   The following provides some examples of the type of data that we
   collect from you:
   Context Types of Data and Purpose for Collection
   Registration Information When you create an Account, we may collect
   your name, contact information, and other Registration Information.
   Such information shall be associated with your Account, and you may
   update such information by editing the information associated with your
   Account.
   Cookies We may use cookies and clear GIFs. “Cookies” are small pieces
   of information that a website sends to your device while you are
   viewing a website. Among other things, cookies allow us to provide you
   with a more personal and interactive experience and to improve our
   marketing efforts. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas or
   features of our websites may not work properly.
   Demographic Information We may collect personal information from you,
   such as your photo or location.
   Digital Fingerprinting We may from time to time use digital
   fingerprinting technologies in an effort to protect and ensure the
   integrity of our Platform. In general, digital fingerprinting
   technologies assign a unique identifier or “Machine-ID” to a user’s
   computer to identify and track the computer’s survey activity. NAFSA
   will not use digital fingerprinting technology to collect personal
   information or track the online activities of the user of a computer
   and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer
   or alter, modify, or change the settings or functionality of a
   computer. The technology will analyze publicly available information
   and data obtained from the computer’s web browser and from other
   publicly available data points, including without limitation the
   technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the
   computer, and the computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, to create
   a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifiers
   are typically alpha-numeric IDs and after creating the unique
   identifier, NAFSA does not retain the information analyzed by the
   technology to create the unique identifier.
   Geo-Location Information When you use one of our Applications or a
   badge or device provided by NAFSA, we may collect your location using
   GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular technology, radio-frequency identification (RFID),
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology, or other similar
   location-tracking technologies. NAFSA may capture proximity and
   duration information for providing personalized products and services,
   demographic analysis, or behavioral analysis. Such information, and any
   derived information, may be shared with third parties that have a
   relationship with NAFSA.
   E-mail Interconnectivity If you receive e-mail from us, we may use
   certain tools to capture data related to when you open our message,
   click on any links or banners it contains and make purchases.
   Employment If you apply for a job posting, or become an employee, we
   may collect personal information necessary to process your application.
   This may include, among other things, your Social Security Number or
   tax identification number.
   Feedback/Support If you provide us feedback or contact us for support
   we will collect your name and e-mail address and possibly other
   personal information, as well as any other content that you send to us
   in order to reply.
   Mailing List When you sign up for one of our mailing lists we may
   collect your e-mail address or postal address.
   Market Research Studies We perform marketing research studies to
   collect data for research purposes. The information you provide is used
   for research analysis and we analyze the answers in aggregate.
   Information you provide in response to or in connection with a market
   research study is and will be provided to our clients or other entities
   or the public as part of cumulative market research information or
   statistical data in the ordinary course, but without identifying you
   individually, directly or indirectly.
   Mobile Devices We may collect information from your mobile device such
   as unique identifying information broadcast from your device or
   hardware and software specifications.
   Order Placement We may collect your name, billing address, shipping
   address, e-mail address, phone number, shipping preferences, and credit
   card number when you place an order.
   Surveys/Partner Promotion When you participate in a survey we may
   collect additional information that you provide through the survey. If
   the survey is provided by a third-party service provider, the third
   party’s privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure
   of your information.
   Web Logs/Third-Party Tracking We may collect information from you,
   including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP)
   address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when
   you use the Internet), domain name, click-activity, referring website,
   or a date/time stamp for your visit. In addition to information stored
   by our servers, we may also use cookies and clear GIFs.

   In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we
   may also receive information about you from other sources, including
   third parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available
   sources.

Use of Personal Information

   In addition to the uses described above, NAFSA uses the personal
   information collected in an effort to improve your experience, to
   provide services to you, and to communicate with you about information
   that you request. NAFSA may also use personal information to help
   target specific offers to you and to help NAFSA develop and improve its
   services. Additionally, NAFSA may use your personal information:
     * To identify you when you access and use any Sites or Applications.
     * To administer Accounts.
     * To provide services and content to our clients.
     * To provide you with products and services you request, or that
       maybe be of interest to you.
     * To streamline your checkout process.
     * To send marketing and promotional materials, including information
       relating to products, services, sales, or promotions.
     * To respond to your inquiries related to support, employment
       opportunities, or other requests.
     * To conduct research and analysis.
     * For internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our
       relationship with you.

Sharing of Personal Information

   In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this
   Privacy Policy, NAFSA may disclose personal information in the
   following situations:
     * Other Disclosures with Your Consent. We may ask if you would like
       us to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties
       who are not described elsewhere in this policy, and we may do so
       with your consent.
     * Other Disclosures without Your Consent. We may disclose personal
       information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or
       in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant
       laws. We may also share your personal information in order to
       establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim,
       to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal
       activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a
       violation of our Terms of Use, or to comply with your request for
       the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a
       third-party intermediary.
     * Public. Some of our Sites or Applications provide the opportunity
       to post comments, or reviews, in a public forum. If you decide to
       submit information at these locations, that information may be
       publicly available.
     * Service Providers. We may share your personal information with
       service providers. Among other things service providers may help us
       to administer our website, plan or facilitate events or travel,
       conduct surveys, provide technical support, or sending marketing,
       promotions, and communications related to our business, payment
       processing, and for other legitimate purposes permitted by law.

Security of Personal Information

   NAFSA has implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to
   help protect the personal information NAFSA collects from loss, misuse,
   unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Although
   NAFSA attempts to protect the personal information in its possession,
   no security system is perfect, and NAFSA cannot promise that your
   personal information will remain absolutely secure in all
   circumstances.

Retention of Personal Information

   NAFSA will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the
   purposes for which it was collected. NAFSA will retain and use your
   personal information as necessary to comply with NAFSA’s business
   requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets,
   and enforce our agreements.

Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

   NAFSA limits the use of personal information to ways that are
   compatible and relevant to the purposes for which the personal
   information was collected or subsequently authorized or for which
   consent was obtained. NAFSA will take reasonable steps to ensure that
   personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate,
   complete, and current.

Your Choices

   You can make the following choices regarding your personal information
   by logging into the Communication Preferences section in My NAFSA in
   your NAFSA account:
     * Electronic and Print Communications. You may choose to consent to
       allowing us to send free NAFSA-specific newsletters, surveys,
       offers, and other promotional materials to you.
     * Third-Party Communications. You may choose to consent for the
       purpose of allowing targeted offers from third parties or NAFSA’s
       clients or business partners. At any time, you can stop receiving
       promotional e-mails by updating your communications preference or
       by following the unsubscribe instructions in e-mails that you
       receive. Clicking on an unsubscribe link will take you to a webpage
       where you can complete the opt-out process. Certain programs will
       provide a contact for support or other means to remove your name to
       remove your name from our contact list. If you decide not to
       receive promotional e-mails, we may still send you transactional
       communications, such as those about your Account, to fulfill orders
       you have made, to ask you to rate a product you purchased, event
       you attended, or other service-related communications.
     * Changes to Your Personal Information. We rely on you to update and
       correct your personal information. Note that we may keep historical
       information in our backup files as permitted by law. All requests
       to correct your information must be directed to the contact in the
       “Communications” section below.
     * Access to Your Personal Information. If required by law (for
       example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation),
       upon request, we will grant reasonable access to the personal
       information that we hold about a User. All requests must be
       directed to the contact in the “Communications” section below.
     * Deletion of Your Personal Information. Typically, we retain your
       personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the
       purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention
       period is required or permitted by law. Some Users may have the
       legal right (for example, under the European Union General Data
       Protection Regulation) to request that we delete their personal
       information. All deletion requests must be directed to the contact
       in the “Communications” section below. We may also decide to delete
       your personal information if we believe that the data is
       incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are
       contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties.
       When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our
       active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not
       practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your
       personal information as needed to comply with our legal
       obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce any of our agreements.
     * Revocation of Consent. We rely on the processing of personal
       information that you have provided. If you revoke your consent for
       the processing of personal information, then we may no longer be
       able to provide you services. In some cases, we may limit or deny
       your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to
       do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.
     * European Economic Area Citizens. Where you believe that we have not
       processed your personal information in accordance with the
       applicable provisions of the European Union General Data Protection
       Regulation, you may lodge a complaint with the respective European
       Union data protection authority (DPA).

Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information

   NAFSA may transfer your personal information to NAFSA’s entities in the
   United States, or to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy
   that are located in various countries around the world. By using
   NAFSA’s Platform or providing any personal information to NAFSA, where
   applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and
   storage of such information outside of your country of residence where
   data protection standards may be different. When NAFSA collects
   information in one country, and transfers it to another, to the extent
   possible it applies the same level of data protection required under
   the laws in the first country even when the data is in the second
   country. In particular, users in the European Union should be aware
   that while the European Commission has not found United States law to
   adequately protect the rights of data subjects, NASFA takes reasonable
   precautions to ensure that all processing activities conducted on our
   behalf are compliant with the European Union General Data Protection
   Regulation.

Dispute Resolution

   NAFSA commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our
   collection or use of your personal information. European Union
   individuals with questions or concerns about our use of personal
   information or our privacy policy should submit a written request to us
   using the information in the “Communications” section below.

   NAFSA commits to cooperate with European Union data protection
   authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities
   with regard to human resources data transferred from the European Union
   in the context of the employment relationship.
