Maintain your house - Yearly Timeline

   [house.jpg]
   in January ...
   Test you home for radon.  A radio-active gas that causes lung cancer,
   radon can build up when windows and doors are sealed tight.  So
   January, the coldest month, is an optimal time for an annual test.
   Make sure you attic insulation is doing the trick.  If snow melts off
   the roof soon after it falls, or if icicles form even when temperatures
   remain
    consistent, too much
    heat may be escaping
    from your home.
   in February...
   Check your sump pump. Do this now, before the first spring thaws of
   March, when melting snow and rain showers can cause basement flooding.
   To test, pour two gallons of water into the drain to raise the float
   and activate the motor.  It should stop running on ce the water level
   drops below the activation level.
   See if your gas meter is iced over.  Accumulated ice on the meter can
   cause it to malfuntion and create a gas leak.  If the meter is iced
   over, contact your gas utility.
   in March...
   Put new batteries in smoke alarms and carbon monxide detectors.  Do
   this when you turn your clocks ahead for daylight saving time.
   Make sure your fire extinguisher is properly pressurized.  Check the
   gauge; the needle should be in the green section.
   in April...
   Paint the house.  Latex paint performs best when the temperature at
   the time of application is 50 to 85 degrees.
   Examine outdoor play equipment.  Pieces made of wood, in particular,
   can get damaged during the winter.  Cut of sand any splinters, and look
   for rotting at the base, which could weaken the structure.
   in May...
   Spray for poison ivy.  This bothersome plant starts sprouting in the
   spring.  And ecologists say that it's reproducing more rapidly than
   ever, due to increased carbon dioxide and global warming.
   Keep pests at bay.  Starting now, hose down garbage cans once a week
   and dump and refill anything, like a bird bath, with standing water.
   in June...
   Swab the deck.  Power-wash a wood deck to get rid of mold; summer
   humidity can cause it to proliferate.
   Schedule your annual chimmey inspection.  It will be more difficult to
   book in the fall.  And you're more likely to get a discount in the
   off-season.
   in July...
   Let the grass grow.  In summer keep grass tall, which slows water loss
   by shading the soil.
   Lower the blinds on south- and west- facing windows.  This will
   prevent up to 45 percent of the sun's heat from entering your home.
   in August...
   Clear dryer vents.  Birds often build nests in vents, creating a
   potential fire hazard.  By August, they stop breeding, so you can
   easily remove any nests.
   Seal concrete garage floors.  Salt on winter roads can erode
   concrete.  Apply a coat of protective epoxy now, when you can work with
   the garage open and temperatures are still high enough for the epoxy to
   dry.
   in September...
   Have your furnace inspected now.  If you don't have heat when the
   first 45 degree day falls, others won't either, and they'll be begging
   for a pro, too.
   Resod.  As temperatures cool, your grass puts more energy into its
   roots to store nutrients for the winter.
   in October...
   Bleed radiators.  To reduce built-up pressure in pipes, fit a bleed
   key into each radiator's valve and turn it counterclockwise.  Use a
   bucket to catch trapped water, then close the valve.
   Test windows for drafts.  Run a lit candle along the perimeter of each
   window.  If the flame flickers, the window may need caulking or weather
   stripping.
   in November...
   Turn off the outdoor water supply.  Trapped water can freeze, causing
   pipes to burst.  Empty the garden hose to prevent it from splitting.
   Unscrew it and coil it up, leaving one end on the ground.  As you coil,
   gravity will force the water out.
   Lubricate locks and hinges on windows and doors.  The dry winter air
   may cause them to stick, so treat them with a lubricant, such as
   WD-40.  Do this to the garage-door rollers, too.
   in December...
   Ensure that toilets are in tiptop shape before the holidays.  To test
   for leaks, put a few drops of dark food coloring into the tank.  If you
   see dye in the bowl, the flapper may need adjusting or replacing.
   Clean gutters.  Some trees release their leaves this late and just
   four or five leaves can block a downspout.

  Paint

   [scan0022.jpg]
   To find a wall color to pair with brown wood tones, look at the wood's
   undertone, then use the hues across from it on the color wheel.
   Suggested palettes -
   Toast + Swedish Blue + Pale Sage: coat the walls with the brown, then
   mix in equal amounts of blue and green accents.
   Taupe + Prussian Blue + Red: Offset this bold palette with light gray
   fabrics and lots of metallic touches.
   [scan0008.jpg]
   Yellow visually expands a room, great to use in transition spaces -
   hallways, and entryways. Layer yellows with deep plum, fresh green, and
   periwinkle.
   Unless you're a diehard coral fan, this hue is more versatile as an
   accent than a wall color.  Because coral can be bold, and vibrant it
   requires the contrast of somthing cool and calming.  Peacock blue, sage
   green, khaki, and putty are all good partners.  White is a natural with
   coral for wall trim, furniture, and accessories.
   Tone it down with brown-ness. Use orange in a contained room so the
   strong color doesn't overwhelm adjoining spaces. Stretch it, do the
   baseboards in the wall color, it is very elongating but keep a white
   ceiling. Hot pink, pale pink, olive green, and robin's egg are all good
   color pairings. But NEVER black.
   Suggested palettes -
   cress + deep orange + plum
   pumpkin + blush + blue.

6 Coachmont Court

   We don't necessarily have to have the dining room where the other
   owners had theirs. We could have the family room rest on the wall
   between the kitchen and great room and have the drive thru window be
   apart of the family room.
   Picture the mirror in the back as the drive thru counter. This is a way
   we could set up the great room. I've been trying to rack my brain on
   how we would fill the space to the right of the drive thru, a bookcase
   might be a good solution?

  Kitchen

   [Black+%26+White+Kitchen.PNG]
   So I think we've finally decided what to do with our new spacious but
   kinda ugly kitchen... until we can remodel... years down the road.  We
   have all white cabinets, awful wallpapering, and out-dated hardware.
   We originally wanted to brighten the kitchen with rich yellow but the
   white cabinets aren't fitting in.  So we decided to paint the walls
   white, and turn the kitchen into a black and white kitchen like you
   would think of in a pizza parlor.  We think this could be easily and
   cheapy done just by changing the fixtures, and adding black tile like
   shown in this picture.
