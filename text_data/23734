Impossible Foods Is Trying to Make Fake Fish Now

Fishy Smell

   Impossible Foods, the meatless meat company behind the plant-based
   Impossible Burger you’ve probably seen at trendy gastropubs, is moving
   into the fake fish market.

   The company is reworking its recipe for plant-based beef to recreate a
   fishy flavor and texture, according to The New York Times. The move
   makes Impossible Foods the latest to enter the race to develop
   convincing and tasty artificial fish, either through concoctions of
   plant proteins or lab-grown cells.

Dirty Water

   Replacing fish with fake meat could benefit the environment, as
   fisheries pollute and deplete wild populations of some species, per the
   NYT. But that may not drive customers to buy filets from Impossible
   Foods or any of the other companies working on fake fish — much of the
   boon for the fake beef market came from people who were worried about
   the health impacts of eating too much red meat.

   “A lot of people will simply say if you eat meat, you’re increasing
   your risk of cancer,” Tom Rees, a food industry expert at the market
   research firm Euromonitor International, told the NYT. “There isn’t an
   equivalent of that for fish.”

Researchers Unveiled The First Chicken Meat Grown Without Chickens

51% of global greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture. We
can fix this.

Lab-grown Meat

   Memphis Meats is no stranger to engineered meat: last year the San
   Francisco startup made the first engineered meatball using bovine
   cells. They also announced that they intended to create turkey meat in
   a petri dish. Their goal? To give the world a safe, sustainable, and
   more humane way to supply the global demand for meat.

   While they haven’t exactly managed to produce their lab-grown turkey
   yet, they did develop the world’s first chicken and duck meats from
   self-producing cells.

   In a statement, Uma Valeti, M.D., co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats
   says:

     It is thrilling to introduce the first chicken and duck that didn’t
     require raising animals. This is a historic moment for the clean
     meat movement. Chicken and duck are at the center of the table in so
     many cultures around the world, but the way conventional poultry is
     raised creates huge problems for the environment, animal welfare,
     and human health. It is also inefficient. We aim to produce meat in
     a better way, so that it is delicious, affordable and sustainable.
     We really believe this is a significant technological leap for
     humanity, and an incredible business opportunity—to transform a
     giant global industry while contributing to solving some of the most
     urgent sustainability issues of our time.

Sustainable Meats

   For years concerns about the environmental implications of the meat
   industry have taken a backseat to the more visible effects of climate
   change. However, a staggering 51 percent of global greenhouse-gas
   emissions are believed to be caused by animal agriculture, according to
   a report from the WorldWatch Institute.

   Shifting to cultured meat means we save on costs for grain, water, and
   waste disposal of livestock. The entire process of engineering meat
   also requires 90 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and less use
   of land and water resources.

   The main barrier for adoption — aside from the cultural resistance to
   eating something that was grown from a petri dish — is cost. When
   Memphis Meats first produced its engineered meatball, it cost $18,000 a
   pound to produce. The company has managed to bring cost down with its
   new technology, and they estimate that producing their chicken mean
   would now cost less than $9,000 per pound.

   Cutting the cost is a great achievement, but there’s still a long way
   to go if lab-grown meat is to become the preferred alternative over
   traditional livestock. There’s still time, though: the company hopes to
   see its cell-produced meat products on the market by 2021.

Qbits for Cubists: Robots Made These Incredible Works of Fine Art

Here are the winners of the 2018 RobotArt competition.

   Hold still while Vincent van Bot paints your portrait.

   That’s right, sophisticated robots can now create works of art
   comparable to the old masters. The RobotArt gallery has amassed an
   impressive collection to show what the world’s most creative androids
   and algorithms (and their creators) have come up with. On Wednesday,
   the international contest, now in its third year, announced the top ten
   teams, all of which walk away with cash prizes for their creations.

   The teams used a number of different approaches, showing that there are
   a hell of a lot of ways to interpret “artwork created by robot.” The
   first-place team, CloudPainter, used a machine learning system to
   generate vivid, sometimes outlandish portraits and landscapes.

   Meanwhile, the bronze medalists from Thailand’s Kasetsart University
   built a robot that can mimic an artist. After recording the position,
   movement, and forces exerted on a painter’s brush, the team’s robot
   could precisely recreate the exact same artwork. Some teams used AI
   algorithms to generate and produce images while others built robots
   designed to mix new combinations of paints or create works
   indistinguishable from human-made artwork.

   “I think in the short term, robots will be used more in the final
   production of digital art — especially those that have a lot of detail
   or repetitive elements,” Andrew Conru, the artist and engineer who
   founded RobotArt, told Futurism.

   He doesn’t think that robotic or algorithmic artists will replace
   creative humans. Far from it, actually. He likens the emergence of
   artwork created by machines to the creation of the camera. Photography
   became an entirely new branch of art that captures different types of
   images and works than painters do.

   But painters didn’t immediately hang up their brushes and ride off into
   the sunset just because cameras started to become more popular (and,
   arguably, democratized the artmaking process.) Just so, Conru believes
   that robotic and human artwork will continue to exist side-by-side,
   each bringing different skills and approaches to the realm of art. As
   his website argues, “We all win when we see something beautiful.”

   But before we see BANKS-E out on the streets tagging its scathing
   political commentary or Android Warhol eating a cheeseburger, we’re
   going to need to see AI and robot technology improve a great deal.
   Right now, artificial intelligence systems excel at specific tasks, but
   they’re not conscious entities. That means we won’t have Paul Gearguin
   or Salvador Dalek renting out studios and collaborating with R2-Degas
   and Paul-KleePO on their next pièce de résistance.

   These algorithms and robotic arms create images but cannot step back
   and appreciate them.

   Rather, as Conru implied, we’re likely to see human artists or
   art-curious engineers develop new technological tools that can be used
   to create better or new styles of art. Also, the sort of tech that
   would allow a machine to generate art is inaccessible to many of the
   people who might want to use it.

   “I think one of the things that is holding the art form back is
   moderately-costing, high-quality robot arms,” Conru told Futurism. He
   expected that we would have quality robotic arms in the one to
   ten-thousand dollar range by now.

   “Unfortunately, there is currently a big gap between $300 toys and $30
   thousand ‘entry-level’ arms,” he added. “Artists tend not to have tens
   of thousands lying around.”

   7/16/2018 9:45 AM Editor’s Note: This article originally stated that
   the winning artworks would be displayed in August during the Seattle
   Art Fair. In a follow-up conversation with Conru, he mentioned that the
   show had been cancelled. As such, the artwork is only available online.

   Amper Music

The World’s First Album Composed and Produced by an AI Has Been Unveiled

Take a moment to listen to the future.

A New Kind of Composer

   “Break Free” is the first sone released in a new album by Taryn
   Southern. The song, indeed, the entire album, features an artist known
   as Amper—but what looks like a typical collaboration between artists is
   actually much more than that.

   Taryn is no stranger to the music and entertainment industry. She is a
   singer and digital storyteller who has amassed more than 500 million
   views on YouTube, and she has over 450 thousand subscribers. On the
   other hand, Amper is making his debut…except he’s (it’s?) not a person.

   Amper is an artificially intelligent music composer, producer, and
   performer. The AI was developed by a team of professional musicians and
   technology experts, and it’s the the very first AI to compose and
   produced an entire music album. The album is called I AM AI, and the
   featured single is set to release on August 21, 2017.

   Check out the song “Break Free” in the video below:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUs6CznN8pw?feature=oembed

   As film composer Drew Silverstein, one of Amper’s founders, explained
   to TechCrunch, Amper isn’t meant to act totally on its own, but was
   designed specifically to work in collaboration with human musicians:
   “One of our core beliefs as a company is that the future of music is
   going to be created in the collaboration between humans and AI. We want
   that collaborative experience to propel the creative process forward.”

   That said, the team notes that, contrary to the other songs that have
   been released by AI composers, the chord structures and instrumentation
   of “Break Free” are entirely the work of Amper’s AI.

Not Just Music Production

   Ultimately, Amper breaks the model followed by today’s music-making
   AIs. Usually, the original work done by the AI is largely reinterpreted
   by humans. This means that humans are really doing most of the legwork.
   As the team notes in their press release, “the process of releasing AI
   music has involved humans making signiﬁcant manual changes—including
   alteration to chords and melodies—to the AI notation.”

   That’s not the case with Amper. As previously noted, the chord
   structures and instrumentation is purely Amper’s; it just works with
   manual inputs from the human artist when it comes to style and overall
   rhythm.

   And most notably, Amper can make music through machine learning in just
   seconds. Here’s an example of a song made by Amper, and re-arranged by
   Taryn.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyXrU_Qo6UQ?feature=oembed

   Yet, while IAMAI may be the first album that’s entirely composed and
   produced by an AI, it’s not the first time an AI has displayed
   creativity in music or in other arts.

   For example, an AI called Aiva has been taught to compose classical
   music, like how DeepBach was designed to create music inspired by
   Baroque artist Johann Sebastian Bach. With this in mind, the album is
   likely just the first step into a new era…an era in which humans will
   share artistry (and perhaps even compete creatively) with AI.

   Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to clarify what songs were
   made by Amper and rearranged by Taryn.

Will the Next Mozart be a Robot?

Humans no longer have a monopoly on creativity.

The Creative AI

   Humankind has done a great deal in terms of making exquisite art,
   whether through its paintings, songs, or performance art. Museums are
   packed with such work, and ordinary people have libraries full of
   fantastic literary achievements—both physical and digital. For the
   longest time, creativity seemed like an exclusively human forte.

   However, now many budding artists are learning to express their
   creativity in the realm of artificial intelligence. Recently, AIs have
   been trying to outperform their human counterparts in a number of
   endeavors, particularly when it comes to playing games. Google’s
   DeepMind proved, on several occasions, that it can go head-to-head
   against human champions in the ancient Chinese game of Go, while OpenAI
   recently developed an algorithm that beat professional e-sports players
   in Dota.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gcUJcwufsg?feature=oembed

   Creative work is the next arena. Pierre Barreau, CEO of Aiva
   Technologies, thinks that creativity is no longer an exclusively human
   quality. AI, like his company’s AI music composer Aiva, can display
   creativity, which Barreau described in an email to Futurism as a
   combination of inspiration and “innovation through randomness.”

   “From Aiva’s point of view, the inspiration is built up through an
   extensive training on 15,000 pieces of symphonic music written by
   Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and other great composers,” Barreau said. “The
   innovation part comes through randomness, as the systems we build are
   stochastic by nature. And it’s, by design, very good at innovating,
   because it can try a lot of very different ideas very quickly.”

Collaborative Creativity

   But exactly how creative can AI get?

   “Artificial Intelligence is already creating art,” said Barreau, who
   thinks that visual art could be the easiest type of art for AI to
   manage— like with DeepDream, for example—”because of the state of the
   art research that’s published and open-sourced, and also because if you
   have an abstract picture, it’s easier to attach meaning to it, as
   opposed to an abstract piece of music or text, where you need to have
   coherence over a period of time.”

   “We’ve already seen poems from AI pass the Turing test. We’ve seen AI
   art that’s been scored higher than art made by humans. And now of
   course, it’s composing music,” musician and digital storyteller Taryn
   Southern told Futurism through email. Taryn, whose work includes the
   first-ever album composed and produced by an AI called Amper, thinks
   that advances in machine learning have made it possible for AI to
   exhibit creativity.

   “There are no limits,” she added. “There are many different types of
   AI, but when you’re working with things like generative adversarial
   networks, where one network is ‘generating’ ideas and the other is
   using markers to determine if that idea is ‘good’ (fits within the
   defined parameters of how a programmer defines a set of data) — you’re
   actually mimicking natural neural processes within the human brain.”

   Yet, for the most part, it seems that creative AIs are built to work in
   tandem with human artists, or in the case of MIT’s AI horror
   storyteller Shelley, at least getting some human input is necessary.
   “For me, the future of creation is one where AIs and humans collaborate
   to create unique art,” Barreau explained.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyXrU_Qo6UQ?feature=oembed

   This partnership between an intelligent algorithm and a talented human
   being is something Taryn is greatly familiar with. “I do think the
   future of creative AI is collaborative, if for no other reason that
   humans are incredible at adapting and synthesizing new information to
   maintain relevance,” Taryn said.

   However, she believes that “AI has the potential to be computationally
   more creative” because of the way AIs produce creative output, which
   could translate to greater creative expression. “In other words, it has
   greater capacity for experimentation,” Taryn added. “But I still
   believe that it’s years and years of human experience and raw emotion
   that add more to the big picture, and texture, of a project.”

Making Us More Creative

   Wait, so intelligent machines are already taking over human jobs and
   now AI will also compete with humankind in the arts? Well, not quite.
   Through this human-AI artistic collaboration, the human element in art
   will always be present. While it is true that some AI have become as
   good as human artists— like DeepBach convincing people that its
   compositions are by Baroque artist Johann Sebastian Bach himself—both
   Barreau and Taryn believe that AI artists won’t replace humans…at
   least, not just yet.

   “Personally, I think we should celebrate an AI becoming creative if it
   doesn’t make us humans irrelevant,” Barreau pointed out. “The challenge
   for companies who create these types of systems is to make sure that
   they use their product(s) in a responsible manner as they scale. […]
   The whole point of AI is not to replace humans, but rather augment
   their capabilities (otherwise, we make ourselves irrelevant),
   especially in use cases where humans alone cannot solve problems.”

   Taryn puts it even further, as she thinks AI will make human artists
   even more relevant, a point she plans to speak about at a Google AI
   conference this Thursday. “So if the AI makes something cool, I think
   humans almost always collectively find new ways to exploit that or
   build off of it to do something new,” Taryn said. “In a weird way, it’s
   the technology that becomes irrelevant quickly, not the human.”

   Infographic

   Exciting times are ahead, indeed, but Taryn said it’s only to be
   expected that this kind of AI will ruffle some feathers and upset human
   artists, particularly in the music industry. “It’s all […] evolving so
   fast, it’s tough to not be afraid of big change,” she said. Instead of
   fearing AI artists, however, one should perhaps consider them to be
   opportunities for even greater creativity. “I’m confident we’ll
   actually see an exponential rise in creativity as a result of AI.”

   Asked about how far AIs could and should pursue creativity, Taryn
   replied: “We’ve always had been fearful of new tech, but the reality
   is, we can’t stop it. My advice to people is to learn how to accept
   change and embrace it. There are no guarantees in life and tech is
   moving at an exponential pace. So it’s good to just have a buddhist
   mindset about all of this and look at the positives.”
