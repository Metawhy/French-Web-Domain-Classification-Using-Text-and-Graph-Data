Featured Destinations

   Alaska
   The 49th State, the largest in the U.S., is perfect for cruisers, with
   numerous opportunities to appreciate its vast natural beauty. Sail
   along the Inside Passage to visit the immense ice formations of Glacier
   Bay and Icy Strait, as well popular ports such as Ketchikan, Skagway
   and Juneau, the only U.S. state capital that's not accessible by car.
   Or travel further north to the Kenai Peninsula and nearby Anchorage, a
   perfect jumping-off point for cruise tours to Denali, Fairbanks and
   Canada's Yukon. Maybe you'll see a bear! What is the best time to
   cruise to Alaska? Alaska cruise season is typically May through
   September, and some locals say early June is one of the best times to
   visit the state. For more: Best Month to Cruise to Alaska. What cruise
   lines go to Alaska? Alaska is one of the most popular cruise
   destinations around, and as a result almost all cruise lines head to
   Alaska during the summer. Visit the Last Frontier on a mega-ship or a
   small expedition vessel; cruisers heading to Alaska are spoiled with
   variety. To narrow down the choice: Cruise Lines going to Alaska. What
   are some things to do in Alaska? Alaska is filled to the brim with
   activities from flightseeing and fishing to dogsledding and
   gold-panning -- and everything in between. For more ideas: Best Alaska
   Shore Excursions. Do you need a passport to take a cruise to Alaska?
   You can visit Alaska without a passport on a closed-loop sailing (one
   that begins and ends in the same U.S. port). Examples include Seattle
   and San Francisco sailings. Be sure to bring your passport if you plan
   on crossing the border from Skagway into Canada's Yukon Territory -- or
   exploring any Canadian port of call. What should I pack for a cruise to
   Alaska? Layers! The weather changes frequently in Alaska and
   necessitates waterproof gear in addition to gloves, hats and even
   T-shirts and shorts. For the full list: What to Pack for an Alaska
   Cruise. { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage",

   Caribbean
   With an island for every taste, the Caribbean is the ultimate place for
   relaxation. You'll find white sands and turquoise water throughout the
   Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Some islands are lush, with
   rainforests and mountain trails, while others have desert climates and
   coral beaches. Wherever you visit, taste regional specialties such as
   conch fritters and get out on the water with snorkeling and sailing
   excursions. What is the best time to cruise to the Caribbean? The
   Caribbean is a year-round cruise destination spanning a region
   containing thousands of islands. Traveling during shoulder seasons in
   fall and spring months help to avoid crowds in port. For more
   information: Best Months to Cruise the Caribbean. What cruise lines go
   to the Caribbean? The Caribbean is arguably the most popular cruise
   destination, and therefore nearly every cruise line has itineraries
   across the Eastern, Western or Southern Caribbean -- from the world's
   largest ships to small sailing yachts. Examples of cruise lines that go
   to the Caribbean include Norwegian, Holland America, Royal Caribbean,
   Celebrity, Viking Ocean, Princess and Windstar. To help you decide:
   Compare Top Cruise Ships in the Caribbean. What are some things to do
   in the Caribbean? Apart from beaches and bars, the Caribbean contains
   endless islands with unique identities that offer historical and
   cultural attractions as well as active pursuits. Hike the Virgin
   Islands National Park in St. John, USVI; snorkel an underwater
   sculpture park in Grenada or zip line in an eco park in St. Maarten.
   For just a sample of what to do, check out: Best Western Caribbean
   Shore Excursions. Do you need a passport to take a cruise to the
   Caribbean? You can visit the Caribbean without a passport on a
   closed-loop sailing (one that begins and ends in the same U.S. port).
   Examples include cruises that depart and return to Galveston, Tampa,
   Baltimore or Orlando. Some Caribbean ports, including Martinique and
   Guadeloupe, will not allow cruisers to get off the ship and enter the
   country without a passport, so check your itinerary and cruise line
   instructions. What should I pack for a cruise to the Caribbean? In
   addition to your lightweight clothes, pack sun protection while
   visiting the Caribbean -- and consider reef-safe sunscreen and bug
   spray. Sun showers can happen, so a thin waterproof layer or umbrella
   might keep you dry during a surprise thunderstorm. { "@context":

   Mediterranean
   From the pristine beaches and ancient ruins of the Eastern
   Mediterranean to the artsy and flavorful countries of the Western
   Mediterranean, this region is easily one of the most diverse in the
   world. Revel at Spanish and Italian architecture, soak up some sun in
   Greece, explore antiquities in Istanbul and Malta or get a taste of the
   French countryside on the outskirts of Nice, Monte Carlo or Cannes.
   Some Med itineraries dip down into northern Africa; the Canary Islands
   are also a popular stop for repositioning cruises. What is the best
   time to cruise to the Mediterranean? The Mediterranean is part of
   Europe, and as such, summer is the most popular time to cruise, but
   sailings are offered through the shoulder seasons of spring and fall --
   and even into December. The late autumn months can be surprisingly
   mild, and are a much calmer time to cruise to the Med. For more
   information: Best Months to Cruise the Mediterranean. What cruise lines
   go to the Mediterranean? A wide variety of large, small and luxury
   lines cruise the romantic ports of the Mediterranean. These include
   Viking Ocean Cruises, Norwegian, MSC, Princess, Royal Caribbean,
   Celebrity, Holland America, Crystal and Azamara. What are some things
   to do in the Mediterranean? Cruises to the Mediterranean are typically
   divided into Eastern and Western itineraries. The Western Med includes
   Italy, Monaco, France and Spain, with plenty of museums, culinary
   tours, wineries, cathedrals and architecture to ogle. The Eastern
   Mediterranean contains historic attractions including the ruins of
   Greece and Turkey, along with sacred sites in Israel or active pursuits
   hiking Montenegro or Croatia. For more: Best Western Mediterranean
   Shore Excursions. Do you need a passport to take a cruise to the
   Mediterranean? Yes. What should I pack for a cruise to the
   Mediterranean? Be sure to pack comfortable clothing -- and especially
   shoes -- for long days of sightseeing. However, Europeans tend to dress
   with a bit of panache; to fit in, pack a stylish scarf or hat, and
   maybe leave your lanyards and socks and sandals at home. { "@context":

   Europe
   Your biggest difficulty planning a European cruise is narrowing down
   where you want to go. A Western Mediterranean itinerary usually
   includes stops in Barcelona and Monaco, as well as ports in Italy.
   Eastern Mediterranean cruises encompass eastern Italy, Croatia and
   Greece, and sometimes even Turkey and Israel. A Baltic Sea voyage
   brings you to Scandinavia and Russia; the Norwegian Fjords carry their
   own beauty. Don't forget about British Isles cruises, which allow you
   to visit castles in England, Scotland and London. For sun lovers, it's
   hard to beat the Canary Islands. What is the best time to cruise to
   Europe? The most popular time to cruise to Europe is during the summer
   months, but the shoulder seasons of spring and fall are prime times to
   see the continent with fewer crowds. Cruise lines sail to Europe
   year-round, with special voyages to view the northern lights, visit
   holiday markets and other wintry wonders, but there are notably less
   sailings during the months of January through February. What cruise
   lines go to Europe? The majority of oceangoing cruise lines offer
   itineraries in Europe, crisscrossing the countries of Northern, Eastern
   and Western Europe. Princess Cruises, Celebrity, Norwegian, Regent,
   Azamara, Silversea, Royal Caribbean, Crystal, Holland America and more
   cruise lines have itineraries here. Europe is also a popular
   destination on river cruise lines such as Viking, Avalon, Emerald,
   Scenic, AmaWaterways, Uniworld and more, heading to a number of rivers
   including the Danube, Rhine or Douro. What are some things to do in
   Europe? Europe is a wealth of cultural landmarks, museums dedicated to
   art and relics, scenic hiking trails, natural wonders, modern capitals
   of fashion and some of the best food or drink on the planet. You could
   do as much as you want traversing Norway, France, Italy or Croatia --
   or simply stroll around and admire the architecture. See more: 15
   European Ports With Amazing Architecture. Do you need a passport to
   take a cruise to Europe? Yes. What should I pack for a cruise to
   Europe? Lots of sightseeing in Europe is done on foot down cobblestone
   streets -- pack comfortable shoes. Consider bringing clothes for both
   sightseeing by day and attending the opera at night, if that’s your
   thing. A simple pashmina or shawl for women helps keep out the chill
   and covers shoulders for cathedral or mosque visits. For more tips: 10
   Must-Pack Items for a European Cruise. { "@context":
