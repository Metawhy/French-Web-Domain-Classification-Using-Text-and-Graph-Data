Cookie Policy

   This is the Cookie Policy for 007.com, accessible from 007.com. We may
   change this Cookie Policy at any time.

   What Are Cookies

   As is common practice with almost all websites, this site uses cookies,
   which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve
   your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how
   we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will
   also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored;
   however, this may downgrade or “break” certain elements of the site’s
   functionality.

   Session cookies are specific to a particular visit and carry
   information as you view different pages so you do not have to re-enter
   information every time you change pages or attempt to checkout. Session
   cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of
   time, such as after you leave the site or when you close your web
   browser.

   Persistent cookies remember certain information about your preferences
   for viewing the site, and allow us to recognize you each time you
   return. Persistent cookies are stored on your browser cache or mobile
   device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete
   themselves at expiration.

   For more general information on cookies, see the Wikipedia article on
   HTTP Cookies.

   How We Use Cookies

   We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Some are
   session cookies and others are persistent cookies. Unfortunately, in
   most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling
   cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features
   they add to this site.

   Disabling Cookies

   You can prevent the setting of cookies or disable set cookies by
   adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how
   to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the
   functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling
   cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
   features of this site.

   The Cookies We Set
     * Essential Cookies.  Essential cookies enable you to navigate the
       site and to use its services and features.  Without these necessary
       cookies, the site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would
       like it to and we may not be able to provide the site or certain
       services or features.
     * Preference Cookies.  Preference cookies collect information about
       your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or
       other local settings and customize the site accordingly.
     * Analytics Cookies.  Analytics cookies collect information about
       your use of the site, and enable us to improve the way it works.
       For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most
       frequently visited pages on the site, help us record any
       difficulties you have with the site, and show us whether our
       advertising is effective or not.  This allows us to see the overall
       patterns of usage on the site, rather than the usage of a single
       person.  We use the information to analyse the site traffic, but we
       do not examine this information for individually identifying
       information.

   Third Party Cookies

   In some special cases, we also use cookies provided by third parties.
   The following section details which third party cookies you might
   encounter through this site.
     * This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread
       and trusted analytics solutions on the web for helping us to
       understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your
       experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you
       spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue
       to produce engaging content. For more information on Google
       Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.
     * From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to
       the way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new
       features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a
       consistent experience whilst on the site whilst ensuring we
       understand which optimisations our users appreciate the most.
     * Several advertising affiliates advertise on our behalf, and
       affiliate tracking cookies simply allow us to see if our customers
       have come to the site through an affiliate’s site so that we can
       credit the affiliate appropriately and where applicable allow our
       affiliate to provide any bonus that it may provide you for making a
       purchase.

   Hopefully that has clarified things for you. If you are looking for
