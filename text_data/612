   The maker of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, and its owners, the Sackler
   family, are offering to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits against the
   company for $10 billion to $12 billion. The potential deal was part of
   confidential conversations and discussed by Purdue's lawyers at a
   meeting in Cleveland last Tuesday, Aug. 20, according to two people
   familiar with the mediation.

   Brought by states, cities and counties, the lawsuits — some of which
   have been combined into one big case — allege the company and the
   Sackler family are responsible for starting and sustaining the opioid
   crisis.

   At least 10 state attorneys general and the plaintiffs’ attorneys
   gathered in Cleveland, where David Sackler represented the Sackler
   family, according to two people familiar with the meeting. David
   Sackler, who was a board member of the company, has recently been the
   de facto family spokesperson.

Purdue Pharma offers $10-12 billion to settle opioid claims

   Aug. 27, 201904:46

   The lawsuits that Purdue and the Sacklers are seeking to settle allege
   that their company’s sales practices were deceptive and at least partly
   responsible for the opioid crisis, which claimed more than 400,000
   lives from 1999 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention. Some of the lawsuits also allege that after 2007 the
   Sackler family drained the company of money to enrich themselves.

   “The Sackler family built a multibillion-dollar drug empire based on
   addiction,” New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in May when
   his state joined others in suing the Sackler family and their company.
   Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey was the first to name
   family members in her suit in January.

   Purdue Pharma, which makes the opioid painkiller OxyContin, and the
   Sackler family have denied the allegations laid out in the lawsuits.

   In a statement to NBC News, the company said, "While Purdue Pharma is
   prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the
   company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of
   wasteful litigation and appeals."

   "The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help
   now. Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path
   forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys
   general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome," the company
   added.

   A representative for the Sackler family did not respond to a request
   for comment.

   At the Cleveland meeting, the company presented a plan for Purdue to
   declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy and then restructure into a for-profit
   “public benefit trust,” according to the summary term sheet that was
   read to NBC News and another source who is familiar with the potential
   deal.

   The Purdue lawyers claim the value of the trust to plaintiffs would
   include more than $4 billion in drugs that would be provided to cities,
   counties and states, the people familiar with the matter said. Some of
   the drugs are used to rescue people from overdoses.

   The in-kind drugs, combined with profits from the sale of drugs, would
   add up to a total Purdue settlement of $7 billion to $8 billion,
   according to two people familiar with the offer.

   overdoses leave pill bottles with protest messages on them outside the
   headquarters of Purdue Pharma, which is owned by the Sackler family, in
   Stamford, Connecticut on Aug. 17, 2018.Jessica Hill / AP file

   The trust would exist for at least 10 years. Three “well-recognized
   expert” trustees would be independently appointed by a bankruptcy
   court, according to the terms of the potential deal. Those trustees
   would in turn choose a board of directors to run the trust, according
   to the term sheet.

   Any profits from the sale of Purdue’s drugs such as OxyContin or
   Nalmefene, a drug that has been fast-tracked by the FDA and would be
   used for emergency treatment of opioid overdoses, would go to the
   cities, counties and states if they agree to the settlement.

   The Sackler family would give up ownership of the company and would no
   longer be involved, according to two people familiar with the matter.

   For their part, the Sackler family, which has faced an increasingly
   hostile activist movement, would pay at least $3 billion. Forbes ranks
   the family as the 19th richest in America, with a fortune of at least
   $13 billion shared by an estimated 20 family members.

   The Sackler money would be obtained by the family selling off
   Mundipharma, a separate global pharmaceutical company they own,
   according to a person briefed on the potential settlement deal. An
   additional $1.5 billion may be tacked onto the $3 billion if the sale
   of Mundipharma exceeds $3 billion.

   Mundipharma describes itself on its website as a privately owned
   network of “independent associated companies” with “a presence in over
   120 countries." Mundipharma is controlled by the Sackler family.

   A 2016 Los Angeles Times investigation of Mundipharma described how the
   global venture offered a new international pipeline for Purdue’s
   opioids.

   Purdue Pharma’s legal team informed the assembled plaintiffs’ attorneys
   that if they did not take the potential settlement, the company would
   go ahead and declare bankruptcy, the people familiar with the matter
   said. The company's lawyers claim the value of a fully liquidated
   Purdue in a standard bankruptcy would be considerably lower than the
   current settlement offer amount, according to documents read to NBC
   News.

   Purdue Pharma is just one of the opioid companies being sued by more
   than 2,000 cities and counties for "grossly" misrepresenting "the risks
   of long-term use of those drugs for persons with chronic pain,"
   according to court documents. The cases against a variety of opioid
   companiesare being overseen by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster of
   Northern Ohio, who attended the meeting last week, according to two
   people familiar with the meeting.

   The states have brought their cases separately. But the Purdue
   settlement deal was presented as a global deal for all plaintiffs,
   including the states, according to people familiar with the potential
   deal.

   The opioid crisis has cost the United States more than $504 billion,
   according to a 2017 report by the White House Council of Economic
   Advisers. Purdue Pharma has earned more than $35 billion from the sale
   of OxyContin.

This Russian startup wants to put huge ads in space. Not everyone is on board
with the idea.

   Swarms of tiny, light-reflecting "cubesats" would come together to form
   luminous words or logos.

   If it sometimes feels as if the world is awash in advertisements, just
   wait. A Russian startup just revealed plans to use swarms of tiny,
   light-reflecting satellites to create sprawling billboards in space.

   The first of StartRocket's space-based ads, shown in a new concept
   video released by the company last week, could go up by 2021. The ads —
   a bit like skytyping, only in low-Earth orbit rather than in the
   atmosphere — would be visible only at night but could be seen from just
   about anywhere on the planet.

   The ads would be created by an array of tiny satellites, each equipped
   with a reflective sail about 30 feet in diameter. As these "cubesats"
   orbit at an altitude of about 280 miles, sunlight would reflect off the
   sails to form luminous words or logos visible from the ground below.

   be seen from just about anywhere on Earth.StartRocket

   The company has a prototype cubesat already, and initial tests of
   space-based advertising could begin early next year, StartRocket CEO
   Vlad Sitnikov said in an email to NBC News MACH. The company hasn’t
   revealed details about which rocket would deliver the satellites into
   orbit or how much it would charge clients to advertise.

   Sitnikov said the company’s plan for space-based advertising was
   inspired by the “disco ball” satellite launched into orbit in January
   2018 by the Huntington Beach, California-based firm Rocket Lab. The
   “Humanity Star” satellite, put into space as an orbiting art project,
   circled the planet for two months before burning up in the atmosphere
   as it fell back toward Earth.

   Sitnikov said the boldness of the Humanity Star project led him to
   wonder: “What if we will invent a new media, the first media in orbit?”

   Not everyone shares Sitnikov’s enthusiasm for adding to the population
   of human-made objects in Earth orbit, which includes 1,400 functioning
   satellites.

   “Putting more satellites up there is going to cause more opportunities
   for collisions, and we don’t want that happening,” said John Crassidis,
   a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University
   at Buffalo. “My biggest issue is that these objects are going to become
   space junk.”

   From defunct satellites and spent rocket parts to wayward tools and an
   astronaut’s glove, there’s already plenty of orbital debris up there.
   The U.S. Department of Defense tracks more than 500,000 pieces of space
   junk in orbit around Earth.

   Sitnikov said the cubesats might remain in orbit for up to a year,
   after which they would be remotely “deorbited” to burn up in the
   atmosphere. But Crassidis said the risks are too high. “It’s not
   serving any good purpose outside of advertising,” he said. “I’m not a
   big fan of this at all.”

   StartRocket’s plan could also raise scientific as well as logistical
   concerns.

   “You would find strong responses from the astronomy and science
   community,” said space law expert Joanne Gabrynowicz, a professor
   emerita at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. “Scientists will
   argue that this reflected light interferes with the ability to study
   the skies. And if it interferes with science, that is harmful.”

   Sitnikov, however, is undeterred.

   “If you ask about critics of advertising and entertainment in space in
   general — haters gonna hate,” he said. “We are developing a new medium.
   In the beginning of television no one loved [ads] at all.”

   The U.S. outlawed space-based advertising in 1993, but Gabrynowicz said
   no such ban is in place in Russia.

Washington could become the first state to legalize human composting

   Washington residents "are very excited about the prospect of becoming a
   tree or having a different alternative,” state Sen. Jamie Pedersen
   said.
   The finished product in "human recomposition" is soil that can then
   nourish new life.

   When Americans die, most are buried or cremated. Washington could soon
   become the first state to allow another option: human composting.

   The novel approach, known as “recomposition,” involves placing bodies
   in a vessel and hastening their decomposition into a nutrient-dense
   soil that can then be returned to families. The aim is a less expensive
   way of dealing with human remains that is better for the environment
   than burial, which can leach chemicals into the ground, or cremation,
   which releases earth-warming carbon dioxide.

   “People from all over the state who wrote to me are very excited about
   the prospect of becoming a tree or having a different alternative for
   themselves,” said state Sen. Jamie Pedersen, a Democrat, who is
   sponsoring a bill in Washington’s Legislature to expand the options for
   disposing of human remains. The recomposition bill would also make
   Washington the 17th state to allow alkaline hydrolysis, the dissolving
   of bodies in a pressurized vessel with water and lye until just liquid
   and bone remains. Pedersen plans to introduce the bill when the new
   legislative session begins next month.

   Pedersen sees recomposition as an environmental and a social justice
   issue. He said allowing it would particularly benefit people who can’t
   afford a funeral or aren’t comfortable with cremation. Recompose aims
   to charge $5,500 for its services, while a traditional burial generally
   cost more than $7,000 in 2017, according to the National Funeral
   Directors Association. (Cremation can cost less than $1,000, though
   that doesn’t include a service or an urn.)

   The push to allow composting of human remains originates with Katrina
   Spade, 41, a Seattle-based designer who started focusing on the idea in
   2013 while working on her master’s in architecture at the University of
   Massachusetts Amherst.

   “We really only have two easily accessible options in the U.S. —
   cremation and burial,” she said. “And the question is: Why do we only
   have two options, and what would it look like if we had a dozen?”

   Spade’s initial goal was to design a system that would restore people’s
   connection to death and its aftermath, which she said had been severed
   in part by the funeral industry. A friend introduced her to the farming
   practice of composting livestock after they die. Called mortality
   composting, the practice has been shown to safely keep pathogens from
   contaminating the land, while creating a richer soil.

   “It was like a lightbulb went off and I started to envision a system
   that uses the same principles as mortality composting … that would be
   meaningful and appropriate for human beings,” she said.

   She worked with researchers at Western Carolina University and the
   Washington State University to turn her vision, which she dubbed
   “recomposition,” into reality. The process involves placing unembalmed
   human remains wrapped in a shroud in a 5-foot-by-10-foot cylindrical
   vessel with a bed of organic material such as wood chips, alfalfa and
   straw. Air is then periodically pulled into the vessel, providing
   oxygen to accelerate microbial activity. Within approximately one
   month, the remains are reduced to a cubic yard of compost that can be
   used to grow new plants.

   Washington State Univ.

   The safety of the process depends on maintaining a temperature of 131
   degrees Fahrenheit for 72 consecutive hours to destroy pathogens,
   according to Spade. This heat is generated by the naturally occurring
   microbes.

   Recompose, a public-benefit corporation Spade founded in 2017 to expand
   research and development of her concept, recently co-sponsored a
   $75,000 pilot program through Washington State University.

   Led by researcher Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, associate professor of
   sustainable and organic agriculture at Washington State, the five-month
   program recomposed six donor bodies in a carefully controlled
   environment, aiming to allay concerns about spreading pathogens.

   The research concluded in August, and the recomposition of human
   remains was found to be safe, according to Carpenter-Boggs, who plans
   to submit her results for publication in 2019. (Recomposition isn’t for
   everyone — some pathogens, like the bacteria that causes anthrax, are
   known to survive composting in animals, so recomposition’s safety will
   depend on excluding people with certain illnesses.)
   Recompose founder Katrina Spade, left, with researcher Lynne
   Carpenter-Boggs.CAHNRS Communications / Washington State Univ.

   “The advantage that I see as a soil scientist and an environmental
   scientist is that it is relatively low in resource use and it also
   creates this soil-like or compost-like product that helps to store
   carbon,” Carpenter-Boggs said. Human compost adds nutrients to soil,
   potentially improving its ability to absorb water and reduce erosion,
   she added.

   An earlier version of Pedersen’s bill, which included alkaline
   hydrolysis but not recomposition, failed in Washington in 2017, which
   Pedersen attributed to opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.

   Thomas Parker, a former lobbyist for the Washington State Catholic
   Conference, said the church was concerned about dissolved human remains
   draining into sewers.

   But State Sen. Michael Baumgartner, a Republican who chaired the
   Senate’s Labor and Commerce Committee in 2017, when the bill was
   introduced, said the church’s opposition did not play a significant
   role in the legislation’s failure. “We prioritized other issues that
   year,” Baumgartner said.

   Alkaline hydrolysis may go against Catholic doctrine that requires the
   human body to be respected, said James LeGrys, theological adviser to
   the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. LeGrys was unfamiliar
   with recomposition, but noted that it could be problematic if body
   parts are separated in any way.

   There is little risk of this happening through recomposition unless
   families request it, according to Spade, who said she has not received
   opposition from any groups, religious or otherwise. She anticipates
   that some families may choose to take their loved one’s remains home to
   plant, while others may donate remains to nourish conservation lands.

   Pedersen has signed up several co-sponsors of the bill in the state
   Senate, which is now under Democratic control, and he’s optimistic
   about its chances. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has not taken a public
   position on the bill and did not respond to a request for comment. If
   the bill passes, it would take effect May 1, 2020.

   This would allow Recompose to officially launch operations in Seattle.
   Spade hopes to partner with funeral homes and cemeteries to bring
   recomposition to other parts of the state and country. In the meantime,
   her company is developing a modular vessel design and refining its
   business model.

   For Spade, the pilot program at Washington State University affirmed
   the inherent beauty of naturally returning humans to the soil.

   “This is something that is really good for humanity,” she said.

   CORRECTION (Dec. 30, 2018 9:45 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this
   article misstated a university Katrina Spade worked with. It is
   Washington State University, not the University of Washington.

Purdue Pharma offers $10-12 billion to settle opioid claims

   The lawsuits allege the company and the Sackler family are responsible
   for starting and sustaining the opioid crisis.

Purdue Pharma offers as much as $12 billion to settle opioid suits

   The maker of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, and its owners, the Sackler
   family, are offering to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits against the
   company for $10 billion to $12 billion. The potential deal was part of
   confidential conversations and discussed by Purdue's lawyers at a
   meeting in Cleveland last Tuesday, Aug. 20, according to two people
   familiar with the mediation.

   Brought by states, cities and counties, the lawsuits — some of which
   have been combined into one big case — allege the company and the
   Sackler family are responsible for starting and sustaining the opioid
   crisis.

   At least 10 state attorneys general and the plaintiffs’ attorneys
   gathered in Cleveland, where David Sackler represented the Sackler
   family, according to two people familiar with the meeting. David
   Sackler, who was a board member of the company, has recently been the
   de facto family spokesperson.

Purdue Pharma offers $10-12 billion to settle opioid claims

   Aug. 27, 201904:46

   The lawsuits that Purdue and the Sacklers are seeking to settle allege
   that their company’s sales practices were deceptive and at least partly
   responsible for the opioid crisis, which claimed more than 400,000
   lives from 1999 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention. Some of the lawsuits also allege that after 2007 the
   Sackler family drained the company of money to enrich themselves.

   “The Sackler family built a multibillion-dollar drug empire based on
   addiction,” New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in May when
   his state joined others in suing the Sackler family and their company.
   Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey was the first to name
   family members in her suit in January.

   Purdue Pharma, which makes the opioid painkiller OxyContin, and the
   Sackler family have denied the allegations laid out in the lawsuits.

   In a statement to NBC News, the company said, "While Purdue Pharma is
   prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the
   company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of
   wasteful litigation and appeals."

   "The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help
   now. Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path
   forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys
   general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome," the company
   added.

   A representative for the Sackler family did not respond to a request
   for comment.

   At the Cleveland meeting, the company presented a plan for Purdue to
   declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy and then restructure into a for-profit
   “public benefit trust,” according to the summary term sheet that was
   read to NBC News and another source who is familiar with the potential
   deal.

   The Purdue lawyers claim the value of the trust to plaintiffs would
   include more than $4 billion in drugs that would be provided to cities,
   counties and states, the people familiar with the matter said. Some of
   the drugs are used to rescue people from overdoses.

   The in-kind drugs, combined with profits from the sale of drugs, would
   add up to a total Purdue settlement of $7 billion to $8 billion,
   according to two people familiar with the offer.

   overdoses leave pill bottles with protest messages on them outside the
   headquarters of Purdue Pharma, which is owned by the Sackler family, in
   Stamford, Connecticut on Aug. 17, 2018.Jessica Hill / AP file

   The trust would exist for at least 10 years. Three “well-recognized
   expert” trustees would be independently appointed by a bankruptcy
   court, according to the terms of the potential deal. Those trustees
   would in turn choose a board of directors to run the trust, according
   to the term sheet.

   Any profits from the sale of Purdue’s drugs such as OxyContin or
   Nalmefene, a drug that has been fast-tracked by the FDA and would be
   used for emergency treatment of opioid overdoses, would go to the
   cities, counties and states if they agree to the settlement.

   The Sackler family would give up ownership of the company and would no
   longer be involved, according to two people familiar with the matter.

   For their part, the Sackler family, which has faced an increasingly
   hostile activist movement, would pay at least $3 billion. Forbes ranks
   the family as the 19th richest in America, with a fortune of at least
   $13 billion shared by an estimated 20 family members.

   The Sackler money would be obtained by the family selling off
   Mundipharma, a separate global pharmaceutical company they own,
   according to a person briefed on the potential settlement deal. An
   additional $1.5 billion may be tacked onto the $3 billion if the sale
   of Mundipharma exceeds $3 billion.

   Mundipharma describes itself on its website as a privately owned
   network of “independent associated companies” with “a presence in over
   120 countries." Mundipharma is controlled by the Sackler family.

   A 2016 Los Angeles Times investigation of Mundipharma described how the
   global venture offered a new international pipeline for Purdue’s
   opioids.

OxyContin maker deceived doctors and patients, fueling opioid crisis,
prosecutors say

   Jan. 16, 201901:40

   Purdue Pharma’s legal team informed the assembled plaintiffs’ attorneys
   that if they did not take the potential settlement, the company would
   go ahead and declare bankruptcy, the people familiar with the matter
   said. The company's lawyers claim the value of a fully liquidated
   Purdue in a standard bankruptcy would be considerably lower than the
   current settlement offer amount, according to documents read to NBC
   News.

   Purdue Pharma is just one of the opioid companies being sued by more
   than 2,000 cities and counties for "grossly" misrepresenting "the risks
   of long-term use of those drugs for persons with chronic pain,"
   according to court documents. The cases against a variety of opioid
   companiesare being overseen by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster of
   Northern Ohio, who attended the meeting last week, according to two
   people familiar with the meeting.

   The states have brought their cases separately. But the Purdue
   settlement deal was presented as a global deal for all plaintiffs,
   including the states, according to people familiar with the potential
   deal.

   The opioid crisis has cost the United States more than $504 billion,
   according to a 2017 report by the White House Council of Economic
   Advisers. Purdue Pharma has earned more than $35 billion from the sale
   of OxyContin.

This Russian startup wants to put huge ads in space. Not everyone is on board
with the idea.

   Swarms of tiny, light-reflecting "cubesats" would come together to form
   luminous words or logos.

   If it sometimes feels as if the world is awash in advertisements, just
   wait. A Russian startup just revealed plans to use swarms of tiny,
   light-reflecting satellites to create sprawling billboards in space.

   The first of StartRocket's space-based ads, shown in a new concept
   video released by the company last week, could go up by 2021. The ads —
   a bit like skytyping, only in low-Earth orbit rather than in the
   atmosphere — would be visible only at night but could be seen from just
   about anywhere on the planet.

   The ads would be created by an array of tiny satellites, each equipped
   with a reflective sail about 30 feet in diameter. As these "cubesats"
   orbit at an altitude of about 280 miles, sunlight would reflect off the
   sails to form luminous words or logos visible from the ground below.

   be seen from just about anywhere on Earth.StartRocket

   The company has a prototype cubesat already, and initial tests of
   space-based advertising could begin early next year, StartRocket CEO
   Vlad Sitnikov said in an email to NBC News MACH. The company hasn’t
   revealed details about which rocket would deliver the satellites into
   orbit or how much it would charge clients to advertise.

   Sitnikov said the company’s plan for space-based advertising was
   inspired by the “disco ball” satellite launched into orbit in January
   2018 by the Huntington Beach, California-based firm Rocket Lab. The
   “Humanity Star” satellite, put into space as an orbiting art project,
   circled the planet for two months before burning up in the atmosphere
   as it fell back toward Earth.

   Sitnikov said the boldness of the Humanity Star project led him to
   wonder: “What if we will invent a new media, the first media in orbit?”

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/309893059

   Not everyone shares Sitnikov’s enthusiasm for adding to the population
   of human-made objects in Earth orbit, which includes 1,400 functioning
   satellites.

   “Putting more satellites up there is going to cause more opportunities
   for collisions, and we don’t want that happening,” said John Crassidis,
   a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University
   at Buffalo. “My biggest issue is that these objects are going to become
   space junk.”

   From defunct satellites and spent rocket parts to wayward tools and an
   astronaut’s glove, there’s already plenty of orbital debris up there.
   The U.S. Department of Defense tracks more than 500,000 pieces of space
   junk in orbit around Earth.

   Sitnikov said the cubesats might remain in orbit for up to a year,
   after which they would be remotely “deorbited” to burn up in the
   atmosphere. But Crassidis said the risks are too high. “It’s not
   serving any good purpose outside of advertising,” he said. “I’m not a
   big fan of this at all.”

   StartRocket’s plan could also raise scientific as well as logistical
   concerns.

   “You would find strong responses from the astronomy and science
   community,” said space law expert Joanne Gabrynowicz, a professor
   emerita at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. “Scientists will
   argue that this reflected light interferes with the ability to study
   the skies. And if it interferes with science, that is harmful.”

   Sitnikov, however, is undeterred.

   “If you ask about critics of advertising and entertainment in space in
   general — haters gonna hate,” he said. “We are developing a new medium.
   In the beginning of television no one loved [ads] at all.”

   The U.S. outlawed space-based advertising in 1993, but Gabrynowicz said
   no such ban is in place in Russia.

Washington could become the first state to legalize human composting

   Washington residents "are very excited about the prospect of becoming a
   tree or having a different alternative,” state Sen. Jamie Pedersen
   said.
   The finished product in "human recomposition" is soil that can then
   nourish new life.

   When Americans die, most are buried or cremated. Washington could soon
   become the first state to allow another option: human composting.

   The novel approach, known as “recomposition,” involves placing bodies
   in a vessel and hastening their decomposition into a nutrient-dense
   soil that can then be returned to families. The aim is a less expensive
   way of dealing with human remains that is better for the environment
   than burial, which can leach chemicals into the ground, or cremation,
   which releases earth-warming carbon dioxide.

   “People from all over the state who wrote to me are very excited about
   the prospect of becoming a tree or having a different alternative for
   themselves,” said state Sen. Jamie Pedersen, a Democrat, who is
   sponsoring a bill in Washington’s Legislature to expand the options for
   disposing of human remains. The recomposition bill would also make
   Washington the 17th state to allow alkaline hydrolysis, the dissolving
   of bodies in a pressurized vessel with water and lye until just liquid
   and bone remains. Pedersen plans to introduce the bill when the new
   legislative session begins next month.

   Pedersen sees recomposition as an environmental and a social justice
   issue. He said allowing it would particularly benefit people who can’t
   afford a funeral or aren’t comfortable with cremation. Recompose aims
   to charge $5,500 for its services, while a traditional burial generally
   cost more than $7,000 in 2017, according to the National Funeral
   Directors Association. (Cremation can cost less than $1,000, though
   that doesn’t include a service or an urn.)

   The push to allow composting of human remains originates with Katrina
   Spade, 41, a Seattle-based designer who started focusing on the idea in
   2013 while working on her master’s in architecture at the University of
   Massachusetts Amherst.

   “We really only have two easily accessible options in the U.S. —
   cremation and burial,” she said. “And the question is: Why do we only
   have two options, and what would it look like if we had a dozen?”

   Spade’s initial goal was to design a system that would restore people’s
   connection to death and its aftermath, which she said had been severed
   in part by the funeral industry. A friend introduced her to the farming
   practice of composting livestock after they die. Called mortality
   composting, the practice has been shown to safely keep pathogens from
   contaminating the land, while creating a richer soil.

   “It was like a lightbulb went off and I started to envision a system
   that uses the same principles as mortality composting … that would be
   meaningful and appropriate for human beings,” she said.

   She worked with researchers at Western Carolina University and the
   Washington State University to turn her vision, which she dubbed
   “recomposition,” into reality. The process involves placing unembalmed
   human remains wrapped in a shroud in a 5-foot-by-10-foot cylindrical
   vessel with a bed of organic material such as wood chips, alfalfa and
   straw. Air is then periodically pulled into the vessel, providing
   oxygen to accelerate microbial activity. Within approximately one
   month, the remains are reduced to a cubic yard of compost that can be
   used to grow new plants.

   Washington State Univ.

   The safety of the process depends on maintaining a temperature of 131
   degrees Fahrenheit for 72 consecutive hours to destroy pathogens,
   according to Spade. This heat is generated by the naturally occurring
   microbes.

   Recompose, a public-benefit corporation Spade founded in 2017 to expand
   research and development of her concept, recently co-sponsored a
   $75,000 pilot program through Washington State University.

   Led by researcher Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, associate professor of
   sustainable and organic agriculture at Washington State, the five-month
   program recomposed six donor bodies in a carefully controlled
   environment, aiming to allay concerns about spreading pathogens.

   The research concluded in August, and the recomposition of human
   remains was found to be safe, according to Carpenter-Boggs, who plans
   to submit her results for publication in 2019. (Recomposition isn’t for
   everyone — some pathogens, like the bacteria that causes anthrax, are
   known to survive composting in animals, so recomposition’s safety will
   depend on excluding people with certain illnesses.)

   Carpenter-Boggs.CAHNRS Communications / Washington State Univ.

   “The advantage that I see as a soil scientist and an environmental
   scientist is that it is relatively low in resource use and it also
   creates this soil-like or compost-like product that helps to store
   carbon,” Carpenter-Boggs said. Human compost adds nutrients to soil,
   potentially improving its ability to absorb water and reduce erosion,
   she added.

   An earlier version of Pedersen’s bill, which included alkaline
   hydrolysis but not recomposition, failed in Washington in 2017, which
   Pedersen attributed to opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.

   Thomas Parker, a former lobbyist for the Washington State Catholic
   Conference, said the church was concerned about dissolved human remains
   draining into sewers.

   But State Sen. Michael Baumgartner, a Republican who chaired the
   Senate’s Labor and Commerce Committee in 2017, when the bill was
   introduced, said the church’s opposition did not play a significant
   role in the legislation’s failure. “We prioritized other issues that
   year,” Baumgartner said.

   Alkaline hydrolysis may go against Catholic doctrine that requires the
   human body to be respected, said James LeGrys, theological adviser to
   the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. LeGrys was unfamiliar
   with recomposition, but noted that it could be problematic if body
   parts are separated in any way.

   There is little risk of this happening through recomposition unless
   families request it, according to Spade, who said she has not received
   opposition from any groups, religious or otherwise. She anticipates
   that some families may choose to take their loved one’s remains home to
   plant, while others may donate remains to nourish conservation lands.

   Pedersen has signed up several co-sponsors of the bill in the state
   Senate, which is now under Democratic control, and he’s optimistic
   about its chances. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has not taken a public
   position on the bill and did not respond to a request for comment. If
   the bill passes, it would take effect May 1, 2020.

   This would allow Recompose to officially launch operations in Seattle.
   Spade hopes to partner with funeral homes and cemeteries to bring
   recomposition to other parts of the state and country. In the meantime,
   her company is developing a modular vessel design and refining its
   business model.

   For Spade, the pilot program at Washington State University affirmed
   the inherent beauty of naturally returning humans to the soil.

   “This is something that is really good for humanity,” she said.

   CORRECTION (Dec. 30, 2018 9:45 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this
   article misstated a university Katrina Spade worked with. It is
   Washington State University, not the University of Washington.

Whistleblower complaint against Trump declassified, could be released
Thursday

   The White House had initially withheld the complaint from Congress,
   setting off a standoff that led to an official impeachment inquiry.

   By Phil Helsel

   The whistleblower complaint that reportedly centers on President Donald
   Trump and his interactions with Ukraine has been declassified, sources
   familiar with the matter told NBC News on Wednesday night.

   The complaint, which the administration initially withheld from
   Congress, was declassified with what were described as minimal
   redactions, the sources said, and there is an expectation that it will
   be released Thursday morning.

   It is thought to be related to a July phone call between Trump and
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

   The details have not been made public, though it has widely been
   reported that the complaint involves Trump, funding for Ukraine and an
   attempt to get information about former Vice President Joe Biden and
   his family. The complaint is at the center of a standoff between the
   White House and Congress that led to a formal impeachment inquiry
   against Trump.

   The White House has not responded to the reported declassification of
   the complaint.

   The complaint was released to Congress on Wednesday, and Democrats who
   read it described it as containing important new information, even
   though they couldn't discuss what the information was.

   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif, said
   Wednesday the allegations in the complaint were "very credible" and
   "deeply disturbing.”

   "The complaint is very well written, and certainly provides information
   for the committee to follow up with other witnesses and documents," he
   said.

   The complaint was filed last month by the acting inspector general for
   Director of National Intelligence, who found it to be "credible" and
   "urgent." It was supposed to be turned over to Congress within a week,
   but acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to
   do so on the advice of the Justice Department.

Schiff: Whistleblower complaint has 'information for ... follow up with other
witnesses'

   Sept. 25, 201901:17

   The whistleblower has not been identified. The legal team representing
   the whistleblower, who they say is a member of the intelligence
   community, said they welcomed its release.

   “We applaud the decision to release the whistleblower complaint as it
   establishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure
   process can work,” attorneys Andrew P. Bakaj, I. Charles McCullough III
   and Mark S. Zaid said in a statement. “We await the release of the
   complaint in its totality,” the attorneys said.

   Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a description of the call
   between Trump and Zelenskiy that showed Trump asked him to look into
   why that country's top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation
   of the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, who served on the board of
   a Ukrainian gas company.

   Trump said Wednesday that he applied "no pressure whatsoever" in his
   phone call with Ukraine’s president. He said it was "friendly" and that
   the media built it up to be the "call from hell" and it turned out to
   be "nothing."

   Democrats widely expressed outrage over the contents of the description
   of the phone call released by the Trump administration.

   Sept. 25, 201902:12

   Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination,
   said Trump "put personal politics above his sacred oath" and accused
   the president of having "put his own political interests over our
   national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian
   pressure."

   The White House noted that the summary of the call was not a verbatim
   transcript and that it represented a record of "the notes and
   recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and National Security
   Council policy staff" who listen to official conversations.

Democrats view 'deeply disturbing' whistleblower complaint about Trump

   "I think it's a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it
   was because it was an urgent matter and it is an urgent matter," Schiff
   said.

Rep. Speier: Whistleblower complaint 'nothing short of explosive"

   The whistleblower complaint at the heart of a weeks-long standoff
   between the White House and Congress that led to a formal impeachment
   inquiry was finally made available to lawmakers on Wednesday. And
   Democrats who read it said it contained important new information, even
   though they couldn't discuss what it was.

   The document by the still-unidentified whistleblower contained
   allegations that were "very credible" and "deeply disturbing," said
   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif. The
   complaint is believed to be related to a July phone call between
   President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

   "The complaint is very well written, and certainly provides information
   for the committee to follow up with other witnesses and documents,"
   Schiff, who was among the lawmakers permitted to view the classified
   complaint, said.

   The complaint was filed last month by the acting inspector general for
   Director of National Intelligence, who found it to be "credible" and
   "urgent." It was supposed to be turned over to Congress within a week,
   but the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire,
   refused to do so on the advice of the Justice Department.

   "I think it's a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it
   was because it was an urgent matter and it is an urgent matter, and
   there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee," Schiff
   said.

   "The idea that the Department of Justice would have intervened to
   prevent it from getting to Congress throws the leadership of the that
   department into further ill repute," Schiff said.

Schiff: Whistleblower complaint has 'information for ... follow up with other
witnesses'

   Sept. 25, 201901:17

   Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said there are "really troubling things here."

   “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say
   there’s no there there when there’s obviously lots that’s very
   troubling there," Sasse, a former Trump critic who was recently
   endorsed by the president, told reporters. He also chided Democrats
   "for using words like impeachment."

   "Everybody in this whole process should slow down," he said.

   He and other lawmakers from the intelligence committees were allowed to
   review the document in a secure location in the Capitol, as was
   Congressional leadership.

   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that
   “having read the documents in there I’m even more worried about what
   happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation.
   There are so many facts have to be examined."

   "It’s very troubling," he added in a statement a short time later. “The
   public has a right to read the whistleblower’s complaint for
   themselves. The contents of the complaint should be made public
   immediately."

   Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., also called for the document to be made
   public.

   "I do not support impeachment of President Trump," she tweeted after
   reviewing the complaint, but "I believe strongly in transparency and it
   should be immediately declassified and made public for the American
   people to read."

   The document was made available hours after text of the July phone call
   was released. Maguire is scheduled to testify about the dispute in
   appearances before the House and Senate on Thursday.

   Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said his level of concern was "no higher than it
   was before I read the complaint."

   “I want to sort out the different views of what I read before I decide
   whether I’m concerned with what I read or not,” he said.

   Rep. Joaquín Castro, D-Texas, and Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat from
   California, had different takeaways.

   "Just read the Whistleblower report," Castro tweeted. "This thing is
   bigger that I thought."

   "I can describe that complaint as nothing short of explosive," Speier
   said on MSNBC Wednesday night.

   CORRECTION (Sept. 25, 2019, 10:30 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this
   article misspelled the first name of a congressman from Texas. He is
   Joaquín Castro, not Joauquin.

Democrats vs. Trump

Trump allies voice concerns about Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine

   Giuliani's role as the president's personal attorney and his claims
   that the State Department asked him to contact Ukrainian officials have
   Trump allies concerned.

   WASHINGTON — Even as they publicly insist President Donald Trump did
   nothing wrong during his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy, his allies are privately acknowledging more serious concerns
   about the ethical questions raised and the potential political fallout
   from it — especially over the involvement of Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s
   personal attorney.

   Two Trump allies, one of whom is a former senior White House official,
   described a level of concern inside the White House that is far greater
   than Trump and his supporters have publicly acknowledged. The former
   official added that Giuliani’s role is particularly problematic legally
   because Giuliani has purely political and personal ties to Trump and
   has no official role with the U.S. government.

   "It’s both better than I think many of us thought given what some of
   the speculation was, and also worse than many of us thought given what
   some of the speculation was," the official said. "The way in which it’s
   worse than people thought basically has to do with Giuliani."

   Sept. 25, 201902:12

   Another Trump ally said they didn’t think Trump’s conduct as revealed
   by the memo is impeachable, but acknowledged the ethical questions
   raised. That ally specifically raised concerns about Trump mentioning
   Biden's name in the call, rather than just corruption more broadly.

   “I wish he hadn’t said it — the Biden line,” that Trump ally said.

   Still, another source close to the president pointed to what so far has
   been a solid wall of Republican support, even as House Democrats begin
   an official impeachment inquiry. No Republican lawmakers have joined
   Democrats in saying they support some type of action towards
   impeachment.

   Giuliani has tried to deflect criticism about his involvement in
   diplomatic issues by saying that he acted at the request of and in
   coordination with the State Department.

   But while the State Department has acknowledged that one of its
   officials put Giuliani in touch with a top aide to the Ukrainian
   president at that aide’s request, the agency has otherwise tried to
   distance itself from Giuliani and his efforts in Ukraine. The State
   Department has described Giuliani as a private citizen who does not
   speak for the U.S. government.

   And a senior Trump administration official said that Giuliani’s claim
   that the State Department “asked me” to look into Ukraine or initiated
   his interactions with Ukraine’s government is false.

   The former senior White House official also said that Giuliani's claim
   that he worked through the State Department to coordinate his talks is
   highly questionable. The former official said that Giuliani should have
   “nothing to do with any of this stuff” and that his involvement in
   pursuing a corruption investigation “makes it inherently political
   rather than official law enforcement."

   "It’s Giuliani who’s really dragged the president into something that’s
   a legal matter and a political matter and will be part of impeachment,"
   the former official said. "What Giuliani did, there's no argument that
   it was a legitimate, government, law enforcement endeavor."

   Yet Trump, who is often quick to abandon even his most loyal allies
   when it becomes politically expedient, was notably supportive of
   Giuliani when asked about him during a meeting with Ukraine’s president
   on Wednesday. He even praised Giuliani’s recent appearances on
   television.

   Giuliani is known to provide Trump with informal political advice, and
   his assistance on an issue that could help the president politically
   has prompted speculation that he might be working for Trump’s
   re-election campaign. But a senior campaign official said Giuliani is
   not on the campaign’s payroll, and Federal Election Commission records
   do not show any payments by Trump’s campaign to Giuliani.
