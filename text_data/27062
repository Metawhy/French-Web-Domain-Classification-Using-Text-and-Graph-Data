Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy establishes the terms under which SANA Hotels
   collects and processes our customers’ personal data, whether through
   websites and social networks or directly in SANA Hotels hotel units,
   restaurant areas and spas.

   We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy carefully, so that your
   decision to provide and entrust us with your personal data may be free,
   informed and voluntary.

   This Privacy Policy applies to all hotels managed and operated under
   the SANA Hotels and Evolution brand. To learn more about the SANA
   universe, please go to www.sanahotels.com.


   1. Privacy Statement

   SANA Hotels is committed to the respect and protection of your personal
   data, and for this reason, we have developed an ongoing service in
   order to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data
   provided.


   The collection and processing of the information you have provided us
   is performed in accordance with the SANA Hotels security and
   confidentiality policies and procedures, in strict compliance with the
   applicable legislation, namely the Personal Data Protection Law, Law
   No. 67/98, of 26/10 (“DPL”) and the General Data Protection Regulation
   (“GDPR”).

    SANA Hotels is responsible for processing your personal data and does
   so in your own exclusive interest.


   As a service provider, SANA Hotels needs to collect and maintain
   information about you necessary for the execution of the respective
   contract, compliance with legal obligations and the pursuit of lawful
   interests, as well as for the protection and defence of SANA Hotels in
   the event of a dispute.


   Should you decide not to provide the information requested, we will be
   unable to fulfil our obligations, which may lead to an inability to
   execute the contract.


   The collection of any additional personal data and the processing of
   personal data for purposes other than those provided for herein, or the
   collection and processing of personal data regarded as sensitive (such
   as data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
   religious or philosophical beliefs, etc.) will be preceded by, and
   subject to your express consent, unless such processing is permitted on
   other legal grounds.


   2. What information will we collect?

   We will only collect and process data necessary for complying with the
   relevant purposes. SANA Hotels will not collect any data that we do not
   need.

   In order to comply with the purposes specified below, the following
   information will be collected: Personal and contact information (name,
   professional/home address, email, phone number, date of birth,
   nationality), family information (name and dates of birth), information
   about services provided, customer preferences, comments, credit card
   data, information for the purposes of SPA treatments, CCTV images in
   public areas, technical information (IP address, log-in data, browser
   type and version, location and time zone, language, operating system
   and platform), information shared publicly on social media, and/or
   information that the data subject decides to share in connection with
   our accounts.

   Your credit card details, used as a means of payment for a reservation
   made on our website, are not collected or stored by SANA Hotels. The
   information is collected and processed by a third-party entity, bound
   by obligations to ensure security and privacy.

   SANA Hotels will not have access to the aforementioned information. We
   keep a log file of the transactions performed on our website that
   leaves out the details of any credit card used.


   3. What will we do with your personal data?

   Your data will be collected and stored by SANA Hotels so we are able to
   provide the contracted services and comply with contractually-assumed
   obligations.


   Therefore, your personal data will be processed by SANA Hotels in
   accordance with the following purposes:

   a)     Reservations management;

   b)     Check-in, invoicing and payment;

   c)     Compliance with legal standards;

   d)     The pursuit of SANA Hotels’ lawful interests (namely, people and
   asset security and product research and development);

   e)     Service provision and treatment suitability in SPAs;

   f)      Response to requests for information and inquiries (quote
   requests, reservation confirmations, etc.);

   g)     Personal preferences management (smoker/non-smoker; preferred
   floor; limited mobility; newspapers and magazines, etc.).


   The purposes identified above may legitimise the processing of your
   personal data even if the contractual relationship ends, for a period
   of time deemed reasonable and justifiable.


   In addition to the purposes referred to above, the personal data
   collected may be used, with your consent, for the following purposes:

   a)     Subscription to newsletters;

   b)     Creation and customisation of advertising campaigns and
   promotions, special offers information, communication of new
   services/new ventures;

   c)     Management of loyalty programmes;

   d)     Management of comments, complaints/claims;

   e)     Notification of changes made to our websites.


   4. Disclosure of information to third parties

   We may transfer your personal data to other companies belonging to the
   SANA Hotels group when such transfer is related to the service
   provision, or the achievement of SANA Hotels’ objectives.


   Your personal data may be provided and accessed by companies providing
   us with IT services (recording/storing the files containing your
   personal data), as well as companies that provide us with the software
   (through which your personal data is stored and processed), namely in
   the event of technical assistance. All the aforementioned companies are
   bound by confidentiality obligations.


   In addition to the case above, we will only disclose your personal data
   to a third party if and to the extent that we are legally required to
   do so.


   5. Your Rights

   Under the terms of the GDPR you are granted certain rights related to
   your personal data.

   You will have the right to request from us the access, correction and
   deletion of your personal data, the right to restrain the processing of
   such data and, in certain circumstances, the right to portability of
   your personal data.


   In case we are processing personal data based on your consent, such
   consent may be withdrawn at any time, in which case the processing will
   have to cease.  Therefore, should you wish to stop receiving
   communications for the purposes of advertising and marketing, please
   send an email to privacy@sanahotels.com.


   In order to exercise the rights referred to above, you should contact
   us via email at privacy@sanahotels.com.


   When exercising your rights, this does not entail the payment of any
   fee. However, unjustified, repetitive or excessive requests may be
   subject to a fee charge.

   Your request for access will be processed as soon as possible. Should
   we see ourselves unable to respond within a period of 30 (thirty) days
   after receiving the request, we will let you know the deadline we need
   to respond to said request.

   Should we see ourselves unable to comply with your request, we will let
   you know the related grounds.


   If you believe that SANA Hotels has not allowed you to exercise your
   rights regarding personal data protection, you may file a complaint
   with the supervisory and administrative authority - Comissão Nacional
   de Proteção de Dados [National Data Protection Commission] – CNPD | Rua
   de São Bento, n.º 148, 3º, 1200-821 Lisbon (Portugal) | Tel.: +351
   213928400 | Fax: +351 213976832 | email: geral@cnpd.pt


   6. Security

   We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal data. To
   protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use, modification,
   disclosure or illegal copying we have implemented a set of appropriate
   technical and organisational measures, such as permanently updated
   anti-virus and anti-spyware protection, SSL encryption for sensitive
   data (credit card, booking form), firewalls, frequent backups,
   restricted access to personal data only for those who need it.


   While no security measures are 100% effective and secure, we are
   committed to protecting the integrity and confidentiality of your
   personal data, wherefore we are continuously reviewing and improving
   our security measures.


   If your access to our websites is done using a username and password
   that was generated or chosen by you, you are responsible for
   maintaining its confidentiality.


   7. Data Retention Period

   Your personal data will be retained for the period strictly necessary
   for complying with the purposes for which it was collected and
   processed, or for the period necessary for complying with the
   applicable legal obligations.


   We will cease the processing of your personal data or remove any
   association of the data to you (“pseudonymisation") as soon as the
   processing ceases to serve its purposes, the compliance of legal
   obligations or the lawful interests of SANA Hotels.


   8. Personal data of minors

   Besides data regarding the name, age and date of birth of your
   children, which we request from you for the purposes of reservations
   management and invoicing, you may also be asked for data regarding

   purposes of staying in our "Kids Club".
