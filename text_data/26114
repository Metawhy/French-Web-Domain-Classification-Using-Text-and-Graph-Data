The Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau.

THE PARIS CONVENTION AND VISITORS BUREAU: THE CAPITAL AT YOUR FINGERTIPS

   The Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau was created in 1971 at the
   joint initiative of the Paris City Council and the Paris Chamber of
   Commerce and Industry*. It carries out three specific missions:
     * Welcome and informing visitors

   Fans of the capital, five tourist offices welcome you all year round.
   An expert multilingual team will provide information on everything that
   you have ever wanted to know about Paris and the Paris region.

   > All our offices

   Not yet arrived? Parisinfo.com, a veritable « virtual tourist office»,
   is for you. Just like in our Paris offices, you can buy accommodation
   products and transport passes (« Paris Visite », etc.) here, as well as
   cultural and leisure products (excursions, cabarets, theme parks, «
   Paris Museum Pass », etc.), and of course the Paris Passlib’, the
   official city pass for the destination. In just a few clicks, you have
   all the « essentials » for a stay in Paris.

   > Our online boutique
     * Promoting the destination in France and abroad

   The Bureau actively promotes Paris as a destination for leisure and
   business tourism to tour operators and the media. It organizes
   promotional campaigns, which highlight such different aspects of Paris
   as: Paris, the capital of shopping, gastronomy, romance... As well as
   providing solid support for the organization of company events, the
   Bureau also actively champions bids by the capital to host national and
   international congresses.

   > All press releases and press files, the key information on tourism
   products in Paris

   > Everything for business tourism and congresses on:
   convention.parisinfo.com

   These promotional campaigns are carried out in close partnership with
   Parisian tourism professionals, for whom the Bureau is a veritable
   platform for dialogue and exchange. A valuable “compass” for the whole
   tourism industry, the Bureau monitors changes in the sector and passes
   on strategic information, notably via talks, newsletters (La Lettre
   from Parisian tourism trade professionals, ParisNews...) and its
   professional extranet.

   > All member services, information and figures on Parisian tourism
   on the website dedicated to professionals: pro.parisinfo.com

   * in the form of a non-profit organization ruled by the French law of 1
   July 1901
