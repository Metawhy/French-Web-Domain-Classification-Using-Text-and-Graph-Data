Benike Boutique

   A blog about a little of this, and a little of that. I am self
   diagnosed as having occasional craft ADD. Ok, maybe not, but seriously,
   there has to be more people out there who can't settle into one
   crafting nitche. Right?

Polymer Clay Creations

   On our summer bucket list, which has now turned into our "project
   binder" One of everyone's favorites is playing with sculpey clay.  This
   stuff is available almost everywhere.  And I usually get mine on an
   online sale or at my local Michaels when it's on sale there.  A little
   bit goes a long way for the kiddos.  So it has lasted us a long time.
   I also use my coupons at Michaels to get some tools because we learned
   there really isn't a great substitue for those.
   [clay+4.jpg]

   Today we are making our own beads to be strung into necklaces later.
   Note: Use a toothpick to create the hole for the beads to be strung
   later.


   [clay.jpg]

   Once everyone is done, place them all in a glass pan and bake according
   to package directions. The younger one did not enjoy creating her own
   beads and rather created blobs.  These needed to bake MUCH longer.  I
   think it ended up being a few hours. I just checked them every 20
   minutes or so.
   [clay+3.jpg]
   [DEL: Once they had cooled :DEL] When Mom found some time several days
   later, we strung them into necklaces.  I forgot to put holes into the
   blobs, so I ended up wrapping them with wire and putting them on that
   way.  They've held up so far, but they are REALLY heavy and so she does
   not really like wearing the necklace.  Lesson learned.
   [clay+2.jpg]

   I always keep a few "fancy" beads on hand for things.  She chose to
   alternate with round black beads and then clear faceted ones.  She
   really enjoyed all aspects of this project. And of course we are
   already looking for more ideas of things the kids can make themselves
   with the clay.

Crayola Fabric Fun

   Whoa, I've been absent lately.  I guess the back to school, fall
   season, life in general bug got me.  This summer we decided to try
   different thing to make our own tshirts and see which we liked best.
   We are far from through our list of techniques but the first one we
   tried was Crayola's Fabric Markers.  And instead of a tshirt we got
   white bandana's from Hobby Lobby.
   [fabric+1.jpg]

   Now, while this is a great idea, I didn't realize how long it would
   take.  But at least it kept them busy for about 45ish minutes.

   [fabric+2.jpg]
   Needless to say, its been awhile since we started this project.  We
   still aren't done.  But it was fun and they do like they get to color
   on something they wouldnt normally be allowed to! :)
   [fabric+3.jpg]

   If I were doing this again, I would maybe do a transfer to a tshirt so
   that it is less to color and they can hopefully finish it in one
   sitting.  Either way, this gets a thumbs up from mom & kiddos.

A Baby (boy) Shower

   This month I had the pleasure of hosting my cousin's (who is like a
   sister) baby shower.  She chose to wait until after baby was born to
   have it. She didn't find out if she was having a boy or a girl and she
   wanted to get lots of stuff that was for a specific sex.
   I made an adorable invite on photoshop, which I'm not going to share
   because it has his picture and all of is info on it. We had the party
   at the new grandma's house for space reasons.  So I didn't want to get
   to carried away with decorations.  Plus it makes for a lot of extra
   work.  I don't recall decorations from one shower I've been to over the
   years.  But I do remember key pieces that were really unique.  So  I
   made the most adorable diaper wreath (if I do say so myself) for decor.
   [Diaper+wreath+2.JPG]
   The menu was delicious of course and made all by me that morning.  We
   had deviled eggs, cheesy potatoes (a recipe I completely made up that
   day!), little wieners, pasta salad, snicker salad and cake and punch.
   Naturally I got the punch idea from Pinterest.
   [Duck+punch.jpg]
   I did mine slightly different than the recipe.  I used white grape
   juice, 7 up, vanilla ice cream and blue food coloring.  None of the 3
   grocery stores﻿ I tried had blue colored kool-aid.  Plus, I did not
   want the added sugar.  I tried a batch at home using blue Gatorade that
   tasted a little different, but still wasn't blue enough to emulate
   water.  The food coloring version was delish!
   [generations.jpg]
   Whenever we have lots of family together, we always take the
   opportunity to update our 5 generation picture.  This is mine.  We are
   SO blessed!
   We played 3 games.  First was a trivia game I made.  I created this
   using facts I found on the Internet.  I have created a free download
   for you to use - not the typo I have! oopsie!.  And if you want
   specific sighting or you want to fact check the answers, just google
   the questions.

                                         [Shower+trivia.jpg]
    The trivia game I created has a typo! Oops! It's a nice ice breaker I
                                 suppose! :)

                         [Shower+trivia+answers.jpg]
                               And the answers!

    Second was "guess what's in the bag" where you put miscellaneous baby
   items into lunch bags, number them, and then have everyone guess what's
   in the bag by feeling them.  I used all items you would find in a
   diaper bag to make it a little less complicated.
    Lastly we played gift bingo. I used the free cards I found.  But if
   you google "baby shower bingo card", you will get a lot of options to
   choose from.  You use the gifts the mom receives as your bingo squares
   and then whoever gets bingo at the end wins the prize.  If no one gets
   bingo, then the host can call out random items until someone gets
   bingo.  Of course this generated a 3 way tie for the last gift when I
   did it.  So I had a few extra baby trivia facts I didn't use on the
   first game.  I used the question, what's the average time it takes a
   dad to change the diaper?  They all guessed a time, and whoever got
   closest to the real answer won.
   I wanted all my prizes to me things I had made.  So this part was a lot
   of fun too!

                               [gift+1.jpg]
               2 votive candles, a bar of soap and a lip balm

                                [gift+2.jpg]
          dish cloths (I love those!), a bar of soap and a lip balm

                                              [gift+3.jpg]
   a brag book made from toilet paper rolls and scrapbook supplies, a bar
                           of soap and a lip balm

   Like I said, that part was LOTS of fun! :)  I also of course, made my
   gift for the mom and baby too.  Another puff quilt...
   [Puff+Quilt+1.jpg]
   It was a pretty easy event to put together.  And with fairly minimal
   stress! If there is enough interest, I'll do future posts on the
   specific parts of the shower (how I made the diaper wreath, my recipes,
   the puff quilt, etc)  Thanks for checking this out!

Blobs in a bottle...not quite...

   [DSC07660-002.JPG]
   The girls decided they wanted to try the blobs in a bottle experiment
   found on Science Bob's website. [lava_bottle.gif]  They were supposed
   to look like this.  But ours didn't quite turn out that way....
   We started out with these suplies:
   [DSC07646-001.JPG]
   The girls  poured everything into their bottles...﻿
   [DSC07647-001.JPG]
   The loved how the water and oil immediately seperate!﻿
   [DSC07653-001.JPG]
   We added the food coloring, and finally dropped in the fizzy tablets.﻿
   [DSC07667-001.JPG]
   We saw reaction (You can see the white fuzzy looking spots on the
   surface inside the bottles) but we never saw colored blobs floating
   around. No matter what we tried.  We went back to the intructions. We
   used a different size bottle that Science Bob.  We used knock off alka
   seltzer and we used equal parts of water and oil because someone didn't
   have enough oil in the house to fill these bottles. I am sure any one
   of these things could have given us scewed results.  Either way, the
   kids still loved this project and I agreed to try it again, once we
   saved up the right supplies.﻿

Summer List: Potato Stampers

   Another quick(ish) and simple kid project.  I had some potatoes that
   were probably fine to eat but not my first choice.  So we broke off all
   the growing parts and made stamps to paint with instead.
   [pot+1.jpg]
   We used powder tempera paint because we hadn't experimented with it
   much yet.  But, after doing this, the liquid tempera paint would have
   been much better and quicker!
   [pot+2.jpg]
   We didn't do anything to complicated for designs.  I used a small
   paring knife and just did the best I could.  And the girls were fine
   with this too.
   [pot+3.jpg]
   We started out with regular copier paper, but that wasn't quite working
   for the girls so we quickly switched to our go-to paper; the butcher
   roll.
   [pot+4.jpg]
   They made MANY pictures and I'm sure some of the relatives would love
   to see some of the masterpieces as well.  This was a very quick project
   but they enjoyed it all the same.

shadow boxes

   I love babies.  I LOVE babies.  Especially my own.  Its been traditon
   that first birthdays are a huge hoopla here.  (2+ birthdays are
   simple cake and ice cream parties) I always thought that day was so
   bittersweet.  So happy to celebrate another first with our child, but
   the real first sign that our baby was no longer a baby and to quickly
   growing up.  I knew I wated to preserve that day beyond my usual
   scrapbooking.  And thanks to Hobby Lobby's awesome frame sale and
   shadow box selection, this idea came quick and easy.
   [1+year+shadowbox.jpg]
   First step is to save a few random things from the party.  I always
   save more than I know will fit into the box because that gives me the
   most options to work with. Here is my finished frame.  Besides the
   items and the shadow box, you may want a cute scrapbook page to be the
   background and some pictures.
   [1st+year+shadow+box+labels.jpg]
   My finished product includes 2 pictures, one wearing the crown, and the
   other post cake! :) I also included a irridescent star we used for
   decorations, an invitation, the birthday princess button and crown she
   wore, and a small napkin.
   [DSC02548.JPG]
   [DSC02547.JPG]
   Now that she is 7, she still loves looking at this. She has asked why I
   didn't make one for each party. That's a neat idea, but 18 boxes per
   kid could get to be a lot of wall space to display them...but still a
   fun idea! :)

I made a Puff Quilt!

   If you have read any of my posts, it's not hard to figure out I L-O-V-E
   pinterest! You may have seen the tutorial for this amazing puff quilt:
   [009.JPG]
   She has an awesome tutorial.  So awesome that even if you have NEVER
   made a quilt of any kind (much like myself) you could complete a puff
   quilt!! I think her's is amazing! But before I tried one myself, I had
   to check out more.  Enter "puff quilt" into pinterest search box.  And
   you'll see many beautiful ones.  My other fav is this one:
   [tealdamask1.jpg]
   Can you believe this one was a give-a-way!!? Awesome! The post is on
   makit-loveit, but the blanket was made by Heidi at Honeybear Lane. All
   3 blogs are really great!
   So with all that beautiful inspiration, and a very pregnant best
   friend, I needed to attempt to make one.  I went to Joann's. I was
   super lucky and received a 60% off coupon back in May.  That was what
   made me decide to get the Minky for the back side.  (I'd never
   attempted to sew minky before.  I am not a fan.)  After my two little
   helpers and I decided on a few different fabrics and patterns we
   wanted, I headed home.  Of course I was extremely excited and didn't
   take hardly any before pictures.
   But here are plenty during:
   [puff+quilt+1.jpg]
   [puff+quilt+2.jpg]
   AHHH! Finally done stuffing!
   [puff+quilt+3.jpg]
   I used minky, flannel and cotton.
   [puff+quilt+4.jpg]
   4 rows done!
   I wanted my blanket to be small enough to throw over the carrier or
   stroller. Or to use for tummy time on the floor. Not really one to wrap
   him up in.  So I made mine a little smaller.  But I am so madly in love
   with it!
   [puff+quilt+5.jpg]
   [puff+quilt+6.jpg]
   [puff+quilt+7.jpg]
   Of course I had to add a tag! :)
   [puff+quilt+8.jpg]
   Ready for giving! Everyone in my family wanted to keep it because it
   was so cuddly.  My husband even asked if I'd make him one.  I'm fairly
   certain he was serious.
   The only changes I made to the tutorials (although I didn't follow them
   exactly) was instead of doing a slip stitch to close it, I did an
   invisible stitch.  Which I'd also never done. It was a little more time
   consuming and I only ripped it out twice! But I was much happier with
   the finished appearance.
   Also worth noting, if your minky gets to long when you are closing the
   last seam/pocket, I just folded mine in on itself.  I would have taken
   a picture of it, but you couldn't hardly tell that it was even there.
   So there wasn't much to show!
   Even if this project intimidates you, or you are just a beginning
   sewer, I still think this is a project anyone could do and the end
   result is worth every minute!!
