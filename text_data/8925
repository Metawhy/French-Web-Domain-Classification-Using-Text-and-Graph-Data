Africa development bank says risks to growth 'increasing by the day'

   Nuzulack Dausen

   3 Min Read

   DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - The U.S.-China trade war and uncertainty over
   Brexit pose risks to Africa’s economic prospects that are “increasing
   by the day,” the head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) told
   Reuters.

   The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has roiled
   global markets and unnerved investors as it stretches into its second
   year with no end in sight.

   Britain, meanwhile, appears to be on course to leave the European Union
   on Oct. 31 without a transition deal, which economists fear could
   severely disrupt trade flows.

       Akinwumi Adesina, president of the AfDB, said the bank could review
   its economic growth projection for Africa - of 4% in 2019 and 4.1% in
   2020 - if global external shocks accelerate.

   “We normally revise this depending on global external shocks that could
   slowdown global growth and these issues are increasing by the day,”
   Adesina told Reuters late on Saturday on the sidelines of the Southern
   African Development Community meeting in Tanzania’s commercial capital
   Dar es Salaam.

       “You have Brexit, you also have the recent challenges between
   Pakistan and India that have flared off there, plus you have the trade
   war between the United States and China. All these things can combine
   to slow global growth, with implications for African countries.”

       The bank chief said African nations need to boost trade with each
   other and add value to agricultural produce to cushion the impact of
   external shocks.

       “I think the trade war has significantly impacted economic growth
   prospects in China and therefore import demand from China has fallen
   significantly and so demand for products and raw materials from Africa
   will only fall even further,” he said.

       “It will also have another effect with regard to China’s own
   outward-bound investments on the continent,” he added, saying these
   could also affect official development assistance.

       Adesina said a continental free-trade zone launched last month, the
   African Continental Free Trade Area, could help speed up economic
   growth and development, but African nations needed to remove non-tariff
   barriers to boost trade.

       “The countries that have always been facing lower volatilities have
   always been the ones that do a lot more in terms of regional trade and
   do not rely on exports of raw materials,” Adesina said.

       “The challenges cannot be solved unless all the barriers come down.
   Free mobility of labour, free mobility of capital and free mobility of
   people.”

   The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has roiled

South Africa, Nigeria mend relations and agree trade deals

   2 Min Read

   JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa and Nigeria signed 30 trade and
   cooperation agreements on Thursday, weeks after a wave of violence
   against Nigerian nationals in Johannesburg and Pretoria had strained
   relations between Africa’s top two economies.

   In September, mobs armed with makeshift weapons attacked businesses and
   homes owned by foreigners, leading to at least 10 deaths, dozens of
   injuries and up to 400 arrests. [nL5N25W2AB]

   In response Nigeria repatriated around 600 of its citizens living in
   South Africa. [nL5N2612HO]

   Presidents Cyril Ramaphosa and Muhammadu Buhari, at the conclusion of a
   two-day visit by the Nigerian leader, said they regretted the violence
   and subsequent retaliation in Nigeria against South African businesses,
   pledging instead to deepen trade ties.

   The local units of South African telecoms company MTN and supermarket
   chain Shoprite closed all stores and service centres in Nigeria after
   their premises were attacked by Nigerians protesting against attacks on
   their compatriots in South Africa. [nL5N25X2M7]

   “As the government of South Africa, we have expressed our deep regret
   at the attacks directed at foreign nationals and our condemnation of
   all forms of intolerance and acts of violence,” Ramaphosa told
   journalists.

   Ramaphosa said the two countries had sealed 32 bilateral agreements and
   memoranda of understanding covering trade and industry, science and
   technology, defence, agriculture and energy.

   Nigeria accounts for 64 percent of South Africa’s total trade with the
   West African Region and is one of its largest trading partners on the
   continent.

   Buhari said beyond the economic partnership the anti-foreigner violence
   had to be addressed quickly.

   “We decided to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such
   unacceptable incidents in the future,” Buhari said.

Nigeria releases 25 children cleared of suspected ties with Boko Haram
-UNICEF

   2 Min Read

   MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - The Nigerian army released 25 children
   on Thursday after clearing them of suspected ties with armed Islamist
   groups in the country’s restive northeast region, the United Nations
   Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.

   Nigeria has fought an insurgency by militant Islamist group Boko Haram
   in northeastern states that has killed more than 30,000 people over the
   past decade. It is not clear how many children in total have been drawn
   into armed groups, including Boko Haram, or how they have been
   recruited.

   UNICEF said 23 boys and two girls were released by the army and handed
   to authorities in Borno, the state worst affected by the insurgency.

   “These are children taken away from their families and communities,
   deprived of their childhood, education, health-care, and of the chance
   to grow up in a safe and enabling environment,” said UNICEF Nigeria
   Acting Representative Pernille Ironside.

   The children would be given access to medical support, education and
   vocational training, the agency said.

   The release comes against the backdrop of widely reported cases of
   young people being held captive in Nigeria in differing circumstances.

   In May, a regional militia allied with government forces freed almost
   900 children it had used in the war against Islamist insurgents.

   Earlier this week police in Lagos, the commercial capital, said they
   had freed 19 women and girls who had mostly been abducted and made
   pregnant by captors planning to sell their babies.

   Last week, around 400 boys and men - some as young as 5 and many in
   chains and scarred from beatings - were rescued from a building in the
   northern city of Kaduna that purported to be an Islamic school.

   Ironside said UNICEF was working to ensure that all children affected
   by the conflict were reunited with their families.

   A total of 2,499 people, including 1,627 children have been cleared of
   association with non-state armed groups in Nigeria since 2016, UNICEF
   said.

Uganda detains supporters of presidential hopeful over banned red berets

   3 Min Read

   KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan security personnel on Thursday detained six
   supporters of pop star and presidential hopeful Bobi Wine for wearing
   red berets, a banned symbol of his “People Power” pressure group, a
   spokesman for the movement said.

   Bobi Wine, attends a news conference at his home in Kasangati, Kampala,

   Wine, 37, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has rattled the
   government since becoming a legislator in 2017 with a line in caustic
   criticism that has earned him growing support.

   His rising political ambitions and connection with young people via his
   music have provoked a clamp-down by the government, which has detained
   some of his supporters and teargassed his rallies.

   Joel Senyonyi, spokesman for Wine’s People Power movement, told Reuters
   the youths were detained in Kabalagala, a suburb in the south of the
   capital Kampala where they were holding a news conference to denounce
   the government’s red beret ban.

   “The youths were emphasising that we commit no offence when we wear
   these berets,” Senyonyi said, adding that police stormed the event and
   detained the six while others fled.

   “The beret, it’s our symbol. When we wear those berets we identify not
   just with People Power but with the cause for a better Uganda,” he
   said.

   Wine and supporters of the People Power movement that he hopes will
   help him unseat veteran leader Yoweri Museveni at the next presidential
   election have been wearing red berets and other items of red clothing
   including shirts and overalls.

   Last month however the government banned civilian use of red berets,
   describing them and other pieces of military wear as “property of the
   state”.

   Civilians found wearing or selling them, the government warned, would
   be prosecuted under military law, which can mean a life sentence.
   [nL5N26L6VI]

   Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told Reuters Wine’s supporters were
   arrested for staging an unlawful assembly because they had not notified
   the police in advance.

   Wine has accused the government of blocking his concerts and
   intimidating his business partners in order to strangle him
   economically and politically.

   Museveni, 75, in power since 1986, is widely expected to seek
   re-election at the next polls in 2021, pitting him against Wine, who
   has said he will also contest in the poll.

Gunmen kidnap six schoolgirls in Nigeria

   1 Min Read

   KADUNA (Reuters) - Gunmen kidnapped six schoolgirls and two staff
   members from a boarding school in northern Nigeria on Thursday, police
   said.

   Police said the girls and staff were taken in the early morning from a
   school called Engravers College in a remote area near the village of
   Kakau Daji in Kaduna state.

   It was not immediately clear who had taken them. While the militant
   Islamist group Boko Haram and a branch of Islamic State are active in
   northern Nigeria, kidnappings by other armed groups are also rampant —
   mostly for ransom.

   “The command is doing everything possible to secure the release of all
   the victims unhurt,” a police statement said.

   About 100 of the more than 270 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from
   the town of Chibok in 2014 remain in captivity. Last week, police in
   the city of Kaduna freed hundreds of men and boys from a purported
   Islamic school where they had been beaten and abused.
