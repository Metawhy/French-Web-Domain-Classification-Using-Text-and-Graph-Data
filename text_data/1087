   warning, this website may harm your computer icon

Stop - there might be a problem with the requested link

   The link you requested has been identified by bitly as being
   potentially problematic. This could be because a bitly user has
   reported a problem, a black-list service reported a problem, because
   the link has been shortened more than once, or because we have detected
   potentially malicious content. This may be a problem because:
     * Some URL-shorteners re-use their links, so bitly can't guarantee
       the validity of this link.
     * Some URL-shorteners allow their links to be edited, so bitly can't
       tell where this link will lead you.
     * Spam and malware is very often propagated by exploiting these
       loopholes, neither of which bitly allows for.

   The link you requested may contain inappropriate content, or even spam
   or malicious code that could be downloaded to your computer without
   your consent, or may be a forgery or imitation of another website,
   designed to trick users into sharing personal or financial information.

bitly suggests that you

     * Change the original link, and re-shorten with bitly
     * Close your browser window
     * Notify the sender of the URL

   Or, continue at your own risk to
   http://antiblock.org/
     * You can learn more about harmful content at www.StopBadware.org
     * You can find out more about phishing from www.antiphishing.org

Grow Your Brand With Every Click

Branded links can drive a 34% higher click-through versus non-branded links,
meaning they help get more eyeballs on your brand and its content.


   branded links

Inspire trust

   As your click numbers go up, your brand recognition increases. And the
   more that grows, the more confident people become in the integrity of
   your content and communications. (It’s a wonderful cycle.)


   campaign analytics

Boost results

   Better deliverability and improved click-through are just the start.
   Rich link-level data allows you to understand who is clicking your
   links, as well as when and where, so you can make smarter decisions
   around the content and communications you share.


auto branding

Gain control

   On top of being able to fully customize your links, auto-branding
   boosts awareness of your brand by giving you credit for your content
   and more insight into how it’s being consumed.
