WSL2 and Kali

   June 13, 2019
   elwood
   Kali Linux News

   Kali Linux has had support for WSL for some time, but its usefulness
   has been somewhat limited. This was mostly due to restrictions placed
   on some system calls , most importantly those revolving around
   networking. Furthermore, additional issues with speed, specifically
   I/O, were also problematic. Because of this, Kali WSL has mostly been
   relegated to reporting functions after an assessment is completed. A
   cool technology, and certainly an amazing engineering feat, but as is,
   it just was not that useful in the field.

   When WSL 2 was announced however, we were excited about what this could
   mean for actually making Kali WSL more useful in. As such, when we saw
   that WSL 2 was available in the Windows Insiders program we wanted to
   jump right on it and see what improvements were made.

WSL2 Conversion

   After you have the new Windows Insider build installed, converting Kali
   WSL 1 to 2 is very easy.

   This was a great surprise for us, as it also means we don’t have to do
   anything on our end to support WSL2. Kali’s current WSL distribution
   will work just fine, and you can convert your existing installation
   easily. According to the docs you can also set WSL2 as your default if
   you don’t have a Kali installed yet.

   Overall, this was a great surprise, and means Kali is ready for WSL 2
   today.

Kali WSL 2 Usage

   Ok, so WSL 2 works with Kali, but is it useful? We are just starting to
   play with WSL 2, so it’s really too early to say. However there are a
   few quick observations we have.

   Basic usage, such as updating Kali and installing packages, appears to
   work just fine.

   However, simply installing something is not that interesting, The
   question is: does it work? One specific tool we wanted to immediately
   check was Nmap, which has always been a WSL pain point. As you can see
   from the screenshot, a basic Nmap scan works right out of the box!
   Thats great news and is very promising for WSL 2 as it continues
   development.

   That should not be a great surprise however, as WSL 2 at its core is
   really a low overhead and optimized VM. This has brought about some
   changes for those of us who have been using WSL for a while. These
   changes fall mostly along the lines of process spaces, networking, and
   filesystem interaction. This brings up some items we will have to watch
   as WSL continues to mature.

All networking appears to be NATed in the current release.

   Microsoft states:

     In the initial builds of the WSL 2 preview, you will need to access
     any Linux server from Windows using the IP address of your Linux
     distro, and any Windows server from Linux using the IP address of
     your host machine. This is something that is temporary, and very
     high on our priority list to fix.

   So, no bridged mode. Anyone who uses Kali in a VM knows that for an
   actual assessment work it’s always better to run Kali in bridged mode,
   not NAT. With the current release, reverse shells are really not going
   to be an easy option without playing around with port forwarding on the
   Windows side. Additionally, we don’t yet know the strength of the NAT
   engine. While scans ran through WSL2 are now possible, their results
   will remain questionable until we find how much the NAT engine impacts
   them.

As it is in a VM, the process space is separate.

   This is interesting, as it might actually open up Kali WSL 2 to be a
   useful endpoint protection bypass. If you get code execution on a
   Windows 10 system that supports WSL 2, could you install a Kali
   instance and pivot from there instead of the base operating system?
   This remains to be seen as this is still in development and Microsoft
   seems to want to unify the Linux and Windows experience as much as
   possible. The end point protection programs might become “WSL Aware”,
   which makes this is an interesting item to watch.

WSL 2’s filesystem is now in a virtual disk.

   Similar to traditional VMs, there is now a virtual disk that holds the
   WSL 2 instance. In the past, one of the WSL issues that would come up
   is that many Kali tools would trigger anti-virus protections. To keep
   Kali WSL useful you would have to make exclusions for the location in
   which the Kali files were saved on the Windows filesystem.

   Now that it’s in a virtual disk, much like the process space isolation,
   it will remain to be seen how AV might deal with it. Currently, it
   appears that AV ignores this virtual disk and its contents but as WSL
   reaches general availability it is possible AV products will become WSL
   2 aware. Again, something we will need to watch.

Overall

   As it stands, WSL 2 is an exciting technology and most definitely worth
   paying attention to. This is the first public beta and a lot will
   change over time. As such, we will track its development and see what
   we can do to make WSL 2 more useful for our purposes. As it stands
   however, it already seems more useful than what we have experienced
   with WSL 1 for actual production use. However, WSL 1 is still supported
   on a WSL 2 system so if you are a WSL user you can pick what’s best for
   you.

   Kali in DigitalOcean Cloud

Kali Linux in the DigitalOcean Cloud

   July 2, 2019
   Thomas d'Otreppe
   Kali Linux News, Kali Linux Tutorials

   DigitalOcean is a cloud provider similar to AWS, Microsoft Azure,
   Google Cloud Platform, and many others. They offer instances, called
   “droplets”, with different Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu,
   FreeBSD, etc. Similar to AWS, DigitalOcean has datacenters around the
   world and sometimes multiple datacenters in each country.

   However, one feature in particular sets them apart them from their
   competitors. A little while ago, they added support for custom images,
   which allows users to import virtual machine disks and use them as
   droplets. This is perfect for us as we can use our own version of Kali
   Linux in their cloud.

   While it might be possible to load the official Kali Linux virtual
   images, it wouldn’t be very efficient. Instead, we’ll build a
   lightweight Kali installation with the bare minimum to get it working.

Generate an ISO

   By default, the Kali Linux ISOs have a GUI installed, and while we
   could use it, we want to minimize the amount of data we have to upload
   to DigitalOcean for reasons we will talk about later. Having a GUI
   running on a headless system is also a waste of resources so while we
   could uninstall it or disable it, we’ll just generate a custom Kali ISO
   without a GUI or any other tools installed. Building the ISO will
   require around 5 GB of hard drive space so make sure you have enough if
   you’re following along.

   First, we’ll make sure the system is up to date:
   apt update
   apt -y full-upgrade

   In case a new kernel was installed, let’s reboot the system before
   continuing and then proceed to start the build.
   apt -y install git live-build cdebootstrap devscripts
   git clone
   https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/live-build-config.git
   cd live-build-config
   ./build.sh --variant minimal --verbose

   It will take a while to build the ISO as it needs to download a lot of
   packages and assemble them. In the meantime, enjoy a nice cup of joe.
   Or tea.

   The ‘- -verbose’ option will display the build log on the screen. It
   can however be removed, and instead progress can be followed in the
   build.log file:
   tail -f build.log

   Once our prompt returns on the terminal where ‘build.sh’ was launched,
   the ISO is ready and can be found in the images/ directory.

Create the Virtual Machine

   With our ISO built, we can now begin to build our virtual machine.
   Create a new virtual machine setting the OS to the latest Debian 64 bit
   and allocating a 20 GB hard disk. If needed, detailed set-up is
   explained on the Kali Training website. It is important to store the
   virtual disk as a single file that is dynamically allocated. The rest
   like the amount of CPU and RAM won’t matter because only the disk file
   will be uploaded to DigitalOcean.

   Disk size matters as billing is based on disk size for custom images.
   It will also impact the choice of instance we can create. Let’s say a
   40 GB hard disk is created, it will fail creating an instance at the
   $5/month level because its maximum hard disk size is 25 GB. In that
   case we would be forced to use the $10/month option for instances with
   50 GB disks. Don’t worry, even though the disk is 20 GB, it will get
   expanded depending on the droplet plan chosen.

   During the installation, select manual partitioning and set it up as
   shown below, with all files in one partition and no swap file.
   Install Process

Update the System

   When installation is complete and after rebooting, we login at the
   console and update the system:
   apt update
   apt -y full-upgrade

   If you don’t see it going over a mirror during ‘apt update’, you may
   have accidentally forgotten to add a network mirror during the
   installation. Follow the instructions on the Kali Docs site to fix it
   and run both of the commands again.

Install Required Packages

   In order for DigitalOcean to configure the system for us, we need to
   install the cloud-init package:
   apt -y install cloud-init
   echo 'datasource_list: [ ConfigDrive, DigitalOcean, NoCloud, None ]' >
   /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99_digitalocean.cfg
   systemctl enable cloud-init

Update GRUB

   When booting, the disk is attached and mapped as sda1. However, with
   the droplets, it is seen as vda1. To remedy this, we need to change all
   instances of sda1 to vda1 in /boot/grub/grub.cfg:
   sed -i 's/sda1/vda1/g' /boot/grub/grub.cfg

   With the configuration file updated, we can run ‘update-grub’ to update
   the system:
   update-grub

Prepare for SSH

   Since we will need to use SSH to connect to the system on DigitalOcean,
   the openssh-server package needs to be installed (and enabled) as well:
   apt -y install openssh-server
   systemctl enable ssh.service

   When creating a standard droplet, you can choose to use SSH keys or
   not. However, when using custom images, this isn’t an option and using
   SSH keys is mandatory. For this reason, DigitalOcean requires us to
   remove the root password:
   passwd -d root

   We also need to create a /root/.ssh folder:
   mkdir /root/.ssh

Cleanup

   Before we finish with our virtual machine, we run a few commands to
   clean things up:
   apt autoremove
   apt autoclean
   rm -rf /var/log/*
   history -c

   At this point, our virtual machine is ready so we run ‘poweroff’ to
   shutdown the system.
   poweroff

Uploading

   In the virtual machine folder, locate the .vmdk file, then compress it
   using bzip2, gzip, or zip in preparation for uploading to DigitalOcean.
   bzip2 kali.vmdk

   Login to your DigitalOcean account. In the “Manage” section on the
   left, click on “Images”, then select the “Custom Images” tab.
   Custom Images

   From there, we upload the compressed disk image. We’ll name it Kali,
   mark it as Debian, and select the region and datacenter to upload it
   to. Note that once uploaded to a location, droplets can only be started
   at that location, which is a current limitation for custom images.
   Another thing to remember at this stage is that uploaded images consume
   disk space and DigitalOcean will bill based on disk usage.

Starting a Droplet

   Once done, the “Uploaded” column will indicate how long ago it was
   uploaded. Now we will click on the “More” option of the image and
   select “Start a droplet”.
   Start a droplet

   You will be taken to the droplet settings where you can select the
   droplet plan, the SSH key, and the project to start it in. Since this
   is a custom image, it is required you use a SSH key. You can either
   select an existing one or upload a new one by clicking on “New SSH
   key”, which will open the following screen where you can paste the
   public key and name it:

   Once done, click “Create” as shown below. It will then take you back to
   the dashboard (Manage > Droplets) where all your droplets are listed.
   Because we are using a SSH key, DigitalOcean will not send an email
   with credentials for the droplet.
   Finalize project

   Within a few seconds, and after the IP is displayed, our droplet will
   be ready. In order to connect, we will need to use the private SSH key
   we created (called MY_KEY in this example):
   user@computer:~$ ssh -i MY_KEY root@192.168.1.1
   The authenticity of host '192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)' can't be
   established.
   ECDSA key fingerprint is
   SHA256:d83fcd43d25e2a7edd291666160b47360cc85870ded.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

   Kali Linux Roadmap 2019-2020

Kali Linux Roadmap (2019/2020)

   June 19, 2019

   Kali Linux News

   Now that our 2019.2 release is out, we thought we would take this
   opportunity to cover some of the changes and new features we have
   coming to Kali Linux in the following year. Normally, we only really
   announce things when they are ready to go public, but a number of these
   changes are going to impact users pretty extensively so we wanted to
   share them early.

   As you read through this post, what you will see is that we are really
   trying to balance our efforts between changes that are user facing and
   those that are applicable to the backend. The backend changes don’t
   seem as exciting at first, but the fact is that the easier it is for us
   to work on Kali, the easier it is for us to get to user facing
   features. Plus, some of these changes are focused on tweaking the
   development process to make it easier for others to get involved in the
   project.

   We are not ready to announce dates on any of these changes just yet.
   When they are ready, they will drop.

GitLab – The New Home for Kali Packages

   One of the biggest changes, which you may have already noticed, is our
   move of the Official Kali git repository to GitLab. With this change,
   it’s easier than ever for the community to submit improvements to Kali
   packages and for us to apply them! We expect to make an heavy use of
   the GitLab Continous Integration features to streamline our work on
   packages and to provide automated feedback to all the contributors
   submitting merge requests.

   Documentation is coming soon on how to contribute packages. Expect a
   full guide to be published in our docs later.

Runtime Tests – Finding Bugs Before Users

   Speaking of packages, the detection of bugs and problems with the
   packages is always something to improve. Until now, we have relied on
   manual testing on our part and user-provided bug reports. This works
   ok, as popular packages would never stay broken for long but some edge
   packages could break for months at a time before anyone would notice
   and actually report it to us. (Let’s be honest, most of the time when
   you find something broken in Kali, you don’t create a bug report do
   you?)

   To improve this situation, we have recently deployed debci on
   autopkgtest.kali.org. This allows us to have our own continuous
   integration system, allowing for automated testing of Kali packages on
   a regular basis. We have integrated the result of those tests in the
   Kali Package Tracker.

   For this infrastructure to be as useful as it can be, we will need to
   have runtime tests on all our packages, which is still a long way off.
   Hopefully, this will be a place where we get community help to speed up
   the process, so feel free to submit merge requests adding tests!

Metapackages – What is Installed by Default

   One of the biggest challenges with running a project like Kali Linux is
   balance. We now have so many users that there’s no longer “one right
   size”. Traditionally, what people have asked for is “all the tools, all
   the time”. But as time has gone by, this has led to one of the largest
   (pun fully intended) issues with Kali: Bloat. Too many packages making
   too big of a distribution, large ISO sizes, etc. etc.

   To address this, we are giving our metapackages a refresh. This change
   includes the default Kali metapackage, “kali-linux-full”, the
   metapackage that controls what packages are installed on Kali by
   default. Needless to say, this is a big user-facing change that will
   impact everyone. Tools that we decide to drop are most often older
   tools that don’t have a lot of modern utility, have not been updated in
   years, or have been supplanted by newer better tools.

   What this means is that by default, some of the tools you may have
   relied upon may no longer be included by default. These tools will
   still exist in the repo, so you can install them manually or use a
   metapackage that contains them. You can see full documentation of the
   metapackages and what they contain at tools.kali.org.

   Before these changes go live, we will do another blog post detailing
   them. Expect that these metapackages will be in flux for a bit as we
   continue to optimize.

Default Shell – Your Primary Kali Interface

   The shell in Kali is likely the most used utility in the entire
   distribution for the majority of users. This creates a bit of a
   schizophrenic challenge in that it’s used so much we want to improve
   it, but at the same time we have to make sure it does not break.

   To address this, we will be adding default installations of ZSH and
   FISH to Kali. Each of these shells are optimized for penetration
   testers, which is sort of fun. Most of the time when you look at shell
   optimization, all the text is focused on developers, which is not where
   Kali sits. Our goal here is to have the best, most optimized, shell
   environment for penetration testers.

   At the same time, good old Bash won’t go away and we are going to leave
   it as the default for now. Those of you that want to be adventurous and
   try the new shells will find easy ways to switch. Those of you that
   just want to stick with Bash will still be able to. Expect in-shell
   instructions (and a blog post) when this change is rolled out.

Documentation – Read The Fine Manual

   Expect some changes to docs.kali.org and tools.kali.org, along with an
   integration of the Kali manual into git via markdown. This will allow
   for user submitted documentation to help us keep instructions up to
   date and accurate. This is another great way for you to contribute to
   the Kali Linux project.

NetHunter – New Blood

   As you may have noticed on Twitter and git commits, we have got another
   developer on board, “Re4son“, and he has put the NetHunter project into
   overdrive. He is working on supporting new hardware, working with the
   latest version of Android, and various bug fixes.

   There is also “Project Redback“, but that is all we are going to say
   about that for the time being…more about this in a blog post very soon.

What Else can we Expect?

   This is just the portion of the roadmap that makes sense to talk about
   now. There is a lot more in development that we are just not ready to
   talk about yet.

   We also would like to welcome g0tmi1k who has switched over from
   Offensive Security as a full time core Kali developer.

   We are at a really exciting stage of the Kali development process,
   where a lot of the behind the scenes items we have been working on are
   getting ready to go public. Expect a fair amount of improvements in
   Kali Linux over the next half of the year. If you want to discuss this
   post with us or have ideas on things that we might consider, please get
   in touch via the forum.
