BioInfo group at LRI, Orsay (France)

   Welcome to our BioInfo group webpage.
   We are located at LRI (Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, UMR
   CNRS 8623, Université Paris-Sud) in Orsay, France.

   The goal of the Bioinfo group is to design and develop new
   computational methods to efficiently tackle true biological issues.
   Skills of its members cover algorithmics, combinatorics, stochastic
   automata, machine learning, knowledge representation and data bases. It
   belongs to the DataSense action line of the DigiCosme labex. It has
   close collaborations with the Bio-Informatique Moléculaire group at
   I2BC.

   Its scientific programme is structured into three themes: Biological
   Sequences and Structures; Systems Biology and Synthetic Biology; and
   Integration and Analysis of Biological Data.
