   Open for all people who work for public causes.


1. Getting started

   whopostedwhat.com is a non public Facebook keyword search for people
   who work in the public interest. It allows you to search keywords on
   specific dates. You are granted access because of your work. We do urge
   you to donate a small amount of money to keep the server running.

   How is it working?
   When you want to search on a specific date, you can search only for the
   year, only the month from a specific year or for a specific date. It is
   also possible to use two or more keywords like terror attack paris. You
   can also search in posts who got posted in between two specific dates.
   It is possible to search in between two years, in between months of
   different years and in between two specific dates. You can again use
   more keywords.
