Welcome to The Pump House in Brighton

A unique city centre pub with a rich history

   The Pump House is one of the oldest and most historic buildings in

   Elliot who bought the building in 1766 and the cellars of our fine old
   building date from medieval times. When the beach was further inland a
   hand-operated pump was used to bring sea water to us and to nearby
   hostelries as people believed it had health giving properties.
