   and help others. Stacy states, “My brother and I suffered from bullying
   all throughout middle and high school. So, when we decided to make

Tell Us Why You Care

   “
     * Bullying can actually RUIN other's life.
       D —
     * I care because there are many people out there that are being
       bullied and many others, unfortunately, don't even notice what they
       are going through. Today you may be enjoying a day at school and
       having fun with your friends while another was being thrown to the
       ground being made fun of and criticized for being themselves.
       Knowing from experience that even one small comment or insult can
       still really affect someone, it can become a huge burden just
       waking up and wondering what people are going to do to you and
       knowing that something bad is going to happen. I know that telling
       other people about the problem can be extremely hard and lead to
       social anxiety but people should know that there are always people
       that care.

     * People i love have suffered from bullying and have tried to hurt
       themselves.
       Angel — 16
     * I dont bully because I know how it feels too be bullied .Dont be a
       bucket dipper be a bucket filler.

Stories

my experience of being bullied in middle school

   September 17, 2019
   Anonymous

   I would like to share my story of how I was bullied and teased for
   three years in middle school. (from the 6th grade to the 8th grade)
   I also want to say I have asperger’s syndrome and that was the main
   reason for the bullies tormenting me for three dark and depressing
   three years, I am not blaming my asperger’s , there is nothing wrong
   with having it and there is nothing with being different and unique.
   Bullying is a major problem across the world especially in public
   schools. I was teased for my casual style, braces, curly hair, being a
   new student, diet, and being a nice smart kid with asperger’s. I was
   called a really ugly names even though I never acted in those ways in
   school. I told on the kids and even my parents reported it to the
   school board and still nothing improved. Bullying and cruel methods
   ruin lives and it needs to be stopped, this is not normal, it must be
   stopped once and for all to have a peaceful world for all.

A Bad Dream That You Can’t Escape

   March 13, 2014
   Meghan and Mikayla

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/bIkhWoVptmk?rel=0

   High school students Meghan and Mikayla know firsthand the effects
   bullying can have. When one of them was cyberbullied, they had to work
   together to heal from the experience and find a way to help others. As
   part of a school project, the friends decided to create a video about
   cyberbullying to spread awareness. Meghan writes, “The video was
   essentially to represent the scarring (represented by the marker) and
   the effects of how bullying affects someone’s everyday life. How it is
   basically a bad dream that you can’t escape.”

Moving

   May 3, 2011
   AMF

   I was born with Cerebral Palsy that only affected the right side of my
   body. I can walk, talk, run, write and read on my own. I feel like any
   other almost fourteen year old girl. In my old neighborhood, the kids
   knew me well, they never judged me.

   When I was seven, I moved. They kids called me things like "The
   Creeper" or even "It". We had a special language class, we learned the
   native language. The teacher would always fail me because I couldn’t
   pronounce the words. The kids would mock me for this, saying this like
   "I don’t speak Chinese, Creeper". When I was in gym, some boys would
   throw their shoes at my face and claim it was an "accident". Then, a
   boy pushed me into a small creek after school, which was covered in
   ice. If my friend wasn’t there, I might have died because back then, I
   couldn’t swim.
