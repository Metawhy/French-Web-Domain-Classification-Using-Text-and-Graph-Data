US-EU trade fight could drag on after 'big victory' at the WTO, says ex-Trump
official

     * The World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the U.S. imposing
       tariffs on the European Union.
     * "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs
       for leverage to get a negotiated outcome," said Clete Willems,
       former National Economic Council deputy director.
     * But the U.S. and the EU have not achieved much in their past trade
       negotiations, so those tariffs could stay in place for many months,
       said Willems.

   Squawk Box Asia

   The World Trade Organization has just authorized the U.S. to go ahead
   with its tariffs worth billions of dollars on the European Union —
   that's "a big deal" that would hopefully bring both sides to the
   negotiating table, said a former high-ranking trade official under
   President Donald Trump.

   But Washington and Brussels have not achieved much in their past trade
   negotiations, so the U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods
   could stay in place for many months, said Clete Willems, who was deputy
   director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC's "Squawk Box
   Asia" on Thursday.

   "It's a big deal: $7.5 billion is the largest retaliation number that
   the WTO has ever authorized. So, it's a big victory for the United
   States," said Willems, who's now a partner at law firm Akin Gump after
   leaving his White House position in April.
   ... you are going to see these tariffs in place for some period of
   months.
   Clete Willems
   former deputy director at the National Economic Council

   "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs for
   leverage to get a negotiated outcome," he said. "But I do think that
   the two sides haven't worked together particularly well when it comes
   to trade negotiations lately and it may take some time for them to work
   through these issues ... so you are going to see these tariffs in place
   for some period of months."

   The WTO outcome on Wednesday came after years of wrangling over
   subsidies that aircraft maker Airbus received from several European
   governments. The U.S. first lodged the complaints in 2004.

   In response to the WTO ruling, the EU suggested it would retaliate
   against U.S. tariffs.

   Closing Bell

   The U.S. and the EU have been at odds over trade issues, especially
   since Trump took office in 2017. Both sides have been trying to
   negotiate a trade deal but have not appeared to make much progress.

   A potential escalation in trade friction between the two sides comes at
   a time when the U.S. is facing off against China in a tariff fight that
   has dampened business sentiment and threatened economic growth
   globally.

   Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote
   in a Thursday note that it's hard not to see the timing and context of
   the WTO ruling as "tragic." He said the decision could steer global
   trade "even more off-course."

   "But the blow is not just to trade as corporate margins erode,
   household discretionary income is diminished, shipping suffers air
   pockets and financial repression is prolonged," he said.

Climate protesters spray 1,800 liters of 'fake blood' over UK Treasury
building

     * Extinction rebellion activists have targeted the U.K. Treasury
       building in London.
     * Protesters say the U.K. is hypocritical to fund fossil fuel
       discoveries while claiming it is tackling climate change.

   LONDON - Climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion has used a
   fire engine to spray fake blood over the steps and entrance to the U.K.
   Treasury building in Westminster, London.

   The group live-streamed the event on Facebook, which showed police
   officers now guarding the entrance. The organization also posted an
   image on Twitter which shows the fire engine covered in part with a
   banner that read "Stop funding climate death."

   The group's website said 1,800 liters of fake blood had been sprayed.
   It added that the 'blood' is made from water colored with food dye that
   can be washed off the building.

   It added that the protest is being held to "highlight the inconsistency
   between the U.K. Government's insistence that the U.K. is a world
   leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money
   into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects"

   Speaking on U.K. radio on Thursday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he
   had sympathy over the right to protests and that the world did face a
   climate emergency.

   Khan warned, however, that police resources to contain public disorder
   was strained and that anyone who wanted to protest "must do it lawfully
   and peacefully."

   On October 7, the Extinction Rebellion group is calling on people to
   participate in a fresh set of protests across 60 cities around the
   world. It says in London the group plans to block 12 areas around
   Westminster.

Scottish whisky to be 'hit hard' by US tariffs after EU Airbus ruling

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20197:37 AM EDTUpdated Thu, Oct 3 20198:09 AM EDT
   David Reid@davyreid73
   Key Points
     * The U.S. plans to impose a 25% tariff on Scottish whisky imports as
       well as other  EU goods including aircraft and agricultural
       products.
     * The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decision follows a WTO
       ruling related to subsidies that helped to develop Airbus planes.
     * The WTO said U.S. plane makers, essentially Boeing, had been
       unfairly impacted by the subsidies from some EU governments.

   The Scottish Whisky Association has said the planned U.S. tariffs on
   the spirit drink is disproportionate and will "undoubtedly damage"
   sales.

   The U.S. has announced it will bring in a tariff of 25% on imports of
   single malt Scotch whisky and liqueurs from the U.K. The move follows a
   World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that says the U.S. is entitled to
   recoup almost $7.5 billion dollars a year via tariffs on EU imports.

   The WTO decision was related to the accusation that several EU
   governments granted illegal subsidies to the plane maker Airbus as it
   looked to develop and sell planes. The WTO said the move had negatively
   impacted sales of U.S. made planes in the large and very large aircraft
   market.

   "The tariff will undoubtedly damage the Scotch Whisky sector. The U.S.
   is our largest and most valuable single market, and over £1 billion of
   Scotch Whisky was exported there last year," said Scottish Whisky
   Association chief executive Karen Betts, in a statement Thursday.

   Several items from different European countries are being targeted but
   Betts said Scottish Whisky had come out of the decision particularly
   badly and would amount to $460 million worth of tariffs annually.

   "Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our
   sector has been hit hard, with Single Malt Scotch Whisky representing
   over half of the total value of U.K. products on the U.S. Government
   tariff list."

   Blended whisky is exempt from tariffs, meaning that Diageo's popular
   Johnnie Walker brand is unaffected by U.S tariffs. Shares in Diageo,
   which also owns Smirnoff and Guinness, rose by nearly 1.5% in Thursday
   morning trade.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target from
   Oct. 18 onwards. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   In 2018, the U.S. imported about $488 billion in products from the EU
   while the U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to EU countries.

   In its response to Wednesday's decision, the U.K. government Department
   of Trade and Industry said: "resorting to tariffs is not in the
   interests of the U.K., EU or U.S."

   The U.K. government also claimed that the U.K. "and other Airbus
   nations" had taken steps to bring support for the plane maker into
   compliance.

   It added that it had seen no effort by the United States to bring its
   support for Boeing into WTO compliance.

   The WTO is expected to offer its ruling on the EU's subsidy case
   against Boeing in 2020.

   CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.

   President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that he said
   would improve private Medicare plans for seniors, slamming Democrats
   for what he described as putting health care "under threat" with
   "Medicare for All" proposals.

   Trump, speaking for an hour at a campaign-style rally at a retirement
   community in Florida, offered few details on his executive order and
   spent most of his speech attacking the health policies of 2020
   Democratic presidential contenders. He said as long as he's president,
   "no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits."

   "Medicare is under threat like never before," Trump told the crowd. "I
   will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give
   it away to illegal aliens."
   VIDEO2:4302:43

   Closing Bell

   Shortly after Trump's speech, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex
   Azar said the president has "directed HHS to take a number of specific,
   significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of
   Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors,
   and improve the health they enjoy."

   Azar said those steps including lowering costs in Medicare Advantage,
   allowing those beneficiaries to create savings accounts and
   accelerating access to the latest medical technologies after being
   approved by regulators.

   Earlier Thursday, senior administration officials said Trump was
   expected to issue an executive order making changes to the Medicare
   program to "protect" Americans from Democratic health-care proposals
   they said would "destroy" coverage for seniors.

   The executive order is intended to bolster Medicare Advantage, which is
   private Medicare insurance for seniors, the officials said on a call
   with reporters. The plan would also offer more affordable plan options,
   encourage wider use of telehealth services, promote wellness benefits
   and bring payments in Medicare fee-for-service program in line with
   payments for Medicare Advantage, officials said.

   Watch:

   Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns
   Hopkins University, said the administration's changes were incremental
   and it could have proposed more benefits like, "r offering dental and
   vision benefits which would bring Medicare up to private sector
   benefits."
   VIDEO8:2308:23
   Here's where the Democratic candidates stand on health care
   Elections

   Trump has made lowering health-care costs one of the key issues of his
   administration as health care remains a top issue for voters in the
   2020 elections.

   The executive order takes direct aim at 2020 Democratic candidates who
   advocate for changes to the U.S. health-care system through some
   version of Medicare for All.

   Arguably the most drastic proposal is from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,
   who is calling for eliminating private health insurance and replacing
   it with a universal Medicare plan. Proponents say it would help reduce
   administrative inefficiencies and costs in the U.S. health-care system.
   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has backed Sanders' proposal.

   During the speech in Flordia, Trump described "Medicare for All" as a
   massive "government health-care takeover" that would "obliterate"
   coverage for seniors.

   "They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing like socialism," he said.
   "Today we're creating a health-care system that protects vulnerable
   patients."

   Spokespersons for Sanders' and Warren's campaigns did not respond to
   requests for comment.

US-EU trade fight could drag on after 'big victory' at the WTO, says ex-Trump

     * "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs

   US tariffs on the EU will have 'significant economic impact'
   Squawk Box Asia

   The World Trade Organization has just authorized the U.S. to go ahead
   with its tariffs worth billions of dollars on the European Union —
   that's "a big deal" that would hopefully bring both sides to the
   negotiating table, said a former high-ranking trade official under
   President Donald Trump.

   But Washington and Brussels have not achieved much in their past trade
   negotiations, so the U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods
   could stay in place for many months, said Clete Willems, who was deputy
   director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC's "Squawk Box
   Asia" on Thursday.

   "It's a big deal: $7.5 billion is the largest retaliation number that
   the WTO has ever authorized. So, it's a big victory for the United
   States," said Willems, who's now a partner at law firm Akin Gump after
   leaving his White House position in April.
   ... you are going to see these tariffs in place for some period of
   months.
   Clete Willems
   former deputy director at the National Economic Council

   "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs for
   leverage to get a negotiated outcome," he said. "But I do think that
   the two sides haven't worked together particularly well when it comes
   to trade negotiations lately and it may take some time for them to work
   through these issues ... so you are going to see these tariffs in place
   for some period of months."

   The WTO outcome on Wednesday came after years of wrangling over
   subsidies that aircraft maker Airbus received from several European
   governments. The U.S. first lodged the complaints in 2004.

   In response to the WTO ruling, the EU suggested it would retaliate
   against U.S. tariffs.

   Closing Bell

   The U.S. and the EU have been at odds over trade issues, especially
   since Trump took office in 2017. Both sides have been trying to
   negotiate a trade deal but have not appeared to make much progress.

   A potential escalation in trade friction between the two sides comes at
   a time when the U.S. is facing off against China in a tariff fight that
   has dampened business sentiment and threatened economic growth
   globally.

   Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote
   in a Thursday note that it's hard not to see the timing and context of
   the WTO ruling as "tragic." He said the decision could steer global
   trade "even more off-course."

   "But the blow is not just to trade as corporate margins erode,
   household discretionary income is diminished, shipping suffers air
   pockets and financial repression is prolonged," he said.

Climate protesters spray 1,800 liters of 'fake blood' over UK Treasury
building

   Key Points
     * Extinction rebellion activists have targeted the U.K. Treasury
       building in London.
     * Protesters say the U.K. is hypocritical to fund fossil fuel
       discoveries while claiming it is tackling climate change.

   LONDON - Climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion has used a
   fire engine to spray fake blood over the steps and entrance to the U.K.
   Treasury building in Westminster, London.

   The group live-streamed the event on Facebook, which showed police
   officers now guarding the entrance. The organization also posted an
   image on Twitter which shows the fire engine covered in part with a
   banner that read "Stop funding climate death."

   The group's website said 1,800 liters of fake blood had been sprayed.
   It added that the 'blood' is made from water colored with food dye that
   can be washed off the building.

   It added that the protest is being held to "highlight the inconsistency
   between the U.K. Government's insistence that the U.K. is a world
   leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money
   into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects"

   Speaking on U.K. radio on Thursday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he
   had sympathy over the right to protests and that the world did face a
   climate emergency.

   Khan warned, however, that police resources to contain public disorder
   was strained and that anyone who wanted to protest "must do it lawfully
   and peacefully."

   On October 7, the Extinction Rebellion group is calling on people to
   participate in a fresh set of protests across 60 cities around the
   world. It says in London the group plans to block 12 areas around
   Westminster.

Scottish whisky to be 'hit hard' by US tariffs after EU Airbus ruling

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20197:37 AM EDTUpdated Thu, Oct 3 20198:09 AM EDT
   David Reid@davyreid73
   Key Points
     * The U.S. plans to impose a 25% tariff on Scottish whisky imports as
       well as other  EU goods including aircraft and agricultural
       products.
     * The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decision follows a WTO
       ruling related to subsidies that helped to develop Airbus planes.
     * The WTO said U.S. plane makers, essentially Boeing, had been
       unfairly impacted by the subsidies from some EU governments.

   The Scottish Whisky Association has said the planned U.S. tariffs on
   the spirit drink is disproportionate and will "undoubtedly damage"
   sales.

   The U.S. has announced it will bring in a tariff of 25% on imports of
   single malt Scotch whisky and liqueurs from the U.K. The move follows a
   World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that says the U.S. is entitled to
   recoup almost $7.5 billion dollars a year via tariffs on EU imports.

   The WTO decision was related to the accusation that several EU
   governments granted illegal subsidies to the plane maker Airbus as it
   looked to develop and sell planes. The WTO said the move had negatively
   impacted sales of U.S. made planes in the large and very large aircraft
   market.

   "The tariff will undoubtedly damage the Scotch Whisky sector. The U.S.
   is our largest and most valuable single market, and over £1 billion of
   Scotch Whisky was exported there last year," said Scottish Whisky
   Association chief executive Karen Betts, in a statement Thursday.

   Several items from different European countries are being targeted but
   Betts said Scottish Whisky had come out of the decision particularly
   badly and would amount to $460 million worth of tariffs annually.

   "Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our
   sector has been hit hard, with Single Malt Scotch Whisky representing
   over half of the total value of U.K. products on the U.S. Government
   tariff list."

   Blended whisky is exempt from tariffs, meaning that Diageo's popular
   Johnnie Walker brand is unaffected by U.S tariffs. Shares in Diageo,
   which also owns Smirnoff and Guinness, rose by nearly 1.5% in Thursday
   morning trade.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target from
   Oct. 18 onwards. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   scroll&access_key=key-GsoraKhnZN9Hq8zcgUmw&show_recommendations=true

   In 2018, the U.S. imported about $488 billion in products from the EU
   while the U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to EU countries.

   In its response to Wednesday's decision, the U.K. government Department
   of Trade and Industry said: "resorting to tariffs is not in the
   interests of the U.K., EU or U.S."

   The U.K. government also claimed that the U.K. "and other Airbus
   nations" had taken steps to bring support for the plane maker into
   compliance.

   It added that it had seen no effort by the United States to bring its
   support for Boeing into WTO compliance.

   The WTO is expected to offer its ruling on the EU's subsidy case
   against Boeing in 2020.

   CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.

   President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that he said
   would improve private Medicare plans for seniors, slamming Democrats
   for what he described as putting health care "under threat" with
   "Medicare for All" proposals.

   Trump, speaking for an hour at a campaign-style rally at a retirement
   community in Florida, offered few details on his executive order and
   spent most of his speech attacking the health policies of 2020
   Democratic presidential contenders. He said as long as he's president,
   "no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits."

   "Medicare is under threat like never before," Trump told the crowd. "I
   will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give
   it away to illegal aliens."
   VIDEO2:4302:43
   Trump wouldn't be surprised if Big Pharma had role in impeachment probe
   Closing Bell

   Shortly after Trump's speech, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex
   Azar said the president has "directed HHS to take a number of specific,
   significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of
   Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors,
   and improve the health they enjoy."

   Azar said those steps including lowering costs in Medicare Advantage,
   allowing those beneficiaries to create savings accounts and
   accelerating access to the latest medical technologies after being
   approved by regulators.

   Earlier Thursday, senior administration officials said Trump was
   expected to issue an executive order making changes to the Medicare
   program to "protect" Americans from Democratic health-care proposals
   they said would "destroy" coverage for seniors.

   The executive order is intended to bolster Medicare Advantage, which is
   private Medicare insurance for seniors, the officials said on a call
   with reporters. The plan would also offer more affordable plan options,
   encourage wider use of telehealth services, promote wellness benefits
   and bring payments in Medicare fee-for-service program in line with
   payments for Medicare Advantage, officials said.

   Watch:

   Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns
   Hopkins University, said the administration's changes were incremental
   and it could have proposed more benefits like, "r offering dental and
   vision benefits which would bring Medicare up to private sector
   benefits."
   VIDEO8:2308:23
   Here's where the Democratic candidates stand on health care
   Elections

   Trump has made lowering health-care costs one of the key issues of his
   administration as health care remains a top issue for voters in the
   2020 elections.

   The executive order takes direct aim at 2020 Democratic candidates who
   advocate for changes to the U.S. health-care system through some
   version of Medicare for All.

   Arguably the most drastic proposal is from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,
   who is calling for eliminating private health insurance and replacing
   it with a universal Medicare plan. Proponents say it would help reduce
   administrative inefficiencies and costs in the U.S. health-care system.
   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has backed Sanders' proposal.

   During the speech in Flordia, Trump described "Medicare for All" as a
   massive "government health-care takeover" that would "obliterate"
   coverage for seniors.

   "They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing like socialism," he said.
   "Today we're creating a health-care system that protects vulnerable
   patients."

   Spokespersons for Sanders' and Warren's campaigns did not respond to
   requests for comment.

   US government to impose tariffs on EU aircraft and agricultural
   products
   Closing Bell

   The U.S. will impose tariffs on European Union goods after a victory at
   the World Trade Organization, according to senior officials from the
   Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target,
   intensifying the Trump administration's global trade battles. The
   duties would take effect Oct. 18. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   Earlier, the WTO gave the Trump administration the right to put tariffs
   on $7.5 billion in European goods. The U.S. had lodged complaints,
   first in 2004, over what it called illegal subsidies for aircraft maker
   Airbus by several European governments.

   U.S. officials contend the EU has "no basis" to retaliate against the
   planned duties. The USTR said it asked the WTO to schedule an Oct. 14
   meeting to approve a U.S. request to take the countermeasures against
   the EU.

   It was not immediately clear if the value of the products on the USTR
   list was $7.5 billion or less than that.

   The action escalates conflicts the Trump administration has waged
   around the globe as it tries to get major trade partners to change
   their practices. The U.S. is locked in a trade war with China as it
   struggles to strike a new agreement with the world's second-largest
   economy.

   The news of a widening trade conflict follows a day of trading when
   major U.S. stock indexes each fell more than 1.5% amid fears of a
   slowing economy. Investors have worried about sustained trade wars
   dragging on global growth and potentially pulling the U.S. into a
   recession.

   Airlines decried the move Wednesday. In a statement, Delta said,
   "Imposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already
   committed to will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions
   of Americans they employ and the traveling public." Meanwhile, JetBlue
   said that it is "concerned about the detrimental impact aircraft
   tariffs will have on the ability for low-cost carries like JetBlue to
   grow and compete."

   Reacting to the WTO decision earlier, European Commissioner for Trade
   Cecilia Malmstrom said new U.S. tariffs would be "short-sighted and
   counterproductive." She left the door open to the EU levying
   retaliatory duties.

   Trump has long decried what he calls unfair trade practices by the EU.
   His administration increased tensions with the bloc when he put tariffs
   on steel and aluminum imports from Europe last year. In response, the
   EU slapped duties on about $3 billion in American goods, including
   bourbon and motorcycles.

   Trump has also threatened duties on cars and auto imports from Europe.
   In May, the administration delayed those tariffs for up to six months.

   The U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to the EU countries combined
   in 2018, making them the largest American export market. The U.S.
   imported about $488 billion in products from the EU, and the nations
   combined are America's second-largest supplier of goods.

Credit Suisse has a word to describe this sluggish economy — a
'semi-recession'

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20198:21 AM EDTUpdated 2 hours ago

   Key Points
     * Credit Suisse says the economy is in a "semi-recession."
     * The firm said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy
       economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground.
     * Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, noted
       that inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still
       expansionary for the economy.

   Investors and economists are chasing a moving target of strong and weak
   economic data, making it increasingly confusing what the state of the
   economy really is.

   Credit Suisse said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy
   economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground.

   "While investors debate whether we're entering a recession, we believe
   the backdrop is better described as a 'Semi-Recession,'" Jonathan
   Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to
   clients Wednesday.

   A gauge of the U.S. manufacturing sector released Tuesday showed the
   lowest reading in more than a decade for September as exports fell amid
   the U.S.-China trade war. The ISM U.S. manufacturing purchasing
   managers' index came in at 47.8% for the month, the lowest since June
   2009. Any reading below 50 signals a contraction.

   [20191001 Manufacturing PMI decline jws.1570102450436.png]

   Meanwhile, industrial production has been in a yearlong deceleration,
   despite a positive reading in August. Manufacturing, which accounts for
   about 11% of the U.S. economy, is being hurt by the trade war between
   the United States and China and slowing global economic growth. The
   0.6% increase in industrial production in August was the largest gain
   in industrial output since August 2018 and followed a 0.1% dip in July,
   according to the Federal Reserve.

   Alongside weak manufacturing data, the yield curve is inverted on the
   short end, meaning the 10-year Treasury note has a lower yield than the
   3-month Treasury bill. This bond market phenomena is regarded as a
   recessionary signal.

   "Recessionary risks are clearly rising," said Golub. "Absent a
   reacceleration in cyclical data, stock upside appears limited," he
   said.

   To be sure, Golub said, "recessionary indicators have weakened but do
   not point to a broad-based downturn."

   Weak data is offset by a strong labor market, Golub said. September's
   jobs report, set to be released Friday, is expected to show 148,000 new
   payrolls and jobless claims continue to decline, he said.

   Golub noted inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still
   expansionary for the economy. While earnings and housing activity are
   neutral.

     * The drop in the Dow comes after reports show slowing in September

   Dow plunges more than 400 points on recession fears—Five pros discuss
   Trading Nation

   Stock indexes were nearing record high levels, until October and the
   fourth quarter began.

   In the last two days the U.S. markets have fallen broadly, as investors
   began showing concern about fresh signs of an economic slowdown.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's losses deepened on Wednesday,
   bringing its two-day decline to 838 points. The Dow has lost 3.1% so
   far this quarter, already wiping out the 1.2% gain of the third
   quarter. It remains up 11.8% for the year.

   [DJI_chart (13).1570046765986.jpeg]

Economy

   The drop in the Dow began after a key measure of U.S. manufacturing saw
   its lowest reading in more than 10 years on Tuesday. September's
   reading of manufacturing data from the Institute of Supply Management,
   or ISM, came in at 47.85% — the second consecutive month of contract
   for the index. Any reading of the ISM index below 50% signals a
   contraction.

   [20191001 Manufacturing PMI decline
   jws.1569942352092.1570040379246.png]

   Shortly behind last month's slowdown in manufacturing was the month's
   private payrolls report on Wednesday, which revealed that the pace of
   hiring is easing as the labor market continues to tighten. ADP and
   Moody's Analytics said companies hired an additional 135,000 workers in
   September, a slowing from 157,000 hirings during the previous month.
   What's more, the August numbers were revised sharply lower, as there
   were 195,000 more workers previously reported for the month.

Impeachment

   The two economic warning signs come as President Donald Trump faces a
   push for impeachment from Democrats, who want to see Trump removed
   on allegations that he abused his power as president. The possibility
   of impeachment has been negative for U.S. stocks, although some
   investors say that if Trump is removed there may be a Clinton-like
   rally in equities.

   One of the main concerns from investors is that impeachment proceedings
   will undermine trade negotiations, especially with China. Last week
   Washington policy analysts warned clients that an impeachment inquiry
   is likely to waylay the U.S. from passing the United
   States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, or from coming to a
   resolution with Beijing. With the escalating trade war weighing on U.S.
   companies, Wall Street remains concerned that Trump will not be able to
   reach a deal that would result in the removal of the tariffs on
   billions of dollars worth of imports.

Technical breakdown

   On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average, a key
   technical indicator watched by analysts. Bespoke Investment Group noted
   on Wednesday that, for the first time in the index's history, the S&P
   500 began October with back-to-back drops of more than 1% each.
   Additionally, the drop of 2.99% was the fourth-worst start to the
   fourth quarter for the S&P 500 in its history — just shy of the 3.01%
   drop at the beginning of 2009's fourth quarter.

   Both the Dow and S&P 500 finished the third quarter of the calendar
   year just below the all-time highs hit in July, so this has been a
   rapid turn of events.

Digitization is changing the way business operates – and one CEO thinks tech
could 'make us happier'

   Digitization has an important role to play when it comes to how small
   and medium enterprises operate, the CEO of Spanish firm Cyberclick said
   Wednesday.
   During a panel discussion at Innovation Summit Barcelona chaired by
   CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, David Tomas was asked whether digitization
   created happiness.
   "I think it can, it definitely can," he said, going on to explain that
   this was particularly the case if one talked about how a company was
   organized.
   "You were mentioning that a lot of people, they don't want to work for
   a bigger company and that's mainly because we know how big companies
   work – I mean, it's hard," he added. "It's a lot of processes,
   miscommunications, too hierarchic."
   One of the opportunities brought by digitization, Tomas explained, was
   to make "flatter" companies with new ways of communicating and "having
   the chance to change the way we work."
   "For me, that would be one of the key points: that we should use
   technology to improve the way we work, to improve our experience and,
   at the end of the day, that will make us happier."
   Technology is undoubtedly changing the way we work, with high speed
   internet connections making it easier for people to work remotely and
   interact with colleagues using video calls, instant messaging services
   and email.

   Back in Barcelona, Cyberclick's David Tomas went on to talk about the
   wider implications of tech. "I think technology – if we use it properly
   – definitely it's going to help us," he said. "The thing is how we use
   it and there's no manual, we need to learn to do that, and maybe it's
   (to) disconnect, or for some other people it's connecting more," he
   added.
   "Whatever it is… we have to look for the opportunity to use digital
   solutions to improve our companies and our life."
