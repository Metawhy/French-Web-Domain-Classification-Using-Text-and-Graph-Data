Participative management

   Individuals all have good ideas.

   We believe in bringing the best of agile business processes to our
   cultural processes also. With an ever fluid product roadmap, the hunt
   for market fit and commerciability requires a work-force that feels
   empowered, invested and -- most importantly -- befriended. We don't
   believe in management, we believe in engineering value via
   collaboration.

   We think having fun, working in a very nice place, with different areas
   dedicated to professional exchange and friendship, is essential. It
   helps everyone feel good, avoid stress and be more productive.
