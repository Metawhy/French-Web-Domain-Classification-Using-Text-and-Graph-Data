Overview

   Toccata is a research team of the INRIA Saclay - Île-de-France research
   center, joint with LRI (CNRS and University of Paris-Sud), located in
   Orsay, France. It was created in September 2012, partly as a
   refoundation of the former team ProVal. Members of Toccata are also
   members of the VALS group of LRI.

   The general objective of the team is to promote formal specification
   and computer-assisted proof in the development of software that
   requires a high assurance of its safety and its correctness with
   respect to its intended behavior.
