What is Solid?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor
   of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to
   radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true
   data ownership as well as improved privacy.

What does Solid offer?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of
   conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications
   based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it
   relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.

   At a glance, here is what Solid offers...
     __________________________________________________________________

True data ownership

   Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides and
   who is allowed to access it. By decoupling content from the application
   itself, users are now able to do so.

Modular design

   Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users
   will be able to avoid vendor lock-in, seamlessly switching between apps
   and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social
   connections.

Reusing existing data

   Developers will be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or
   improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was
   created by other apps.

What’s happening now?
     __________________________________________________________________

   The success of the Solid project has led to some new exciting
   developments to help it gain broad worldwide adoption.

Inrupt

   We are pleased to note that a new start-up, Inrupt, Inc, will be
   putting its own effort into the Solid open source technology and the
   Solid movement.

   Inrupt is building a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid’s success and
   protect the integrity of the next phase of the web. Its mission is to
   restore rightful ownership of data back to every web user and unleash a
   new wave of innovation - for developers, for business, for everyone.

   Read Tim's open letter to the community about Solid and Inrupt.

Solid Community Site

   The best resource for all things Solid is now the Solid Community Site,
   supported by Inrupt.

   There you will find regular community updates, a wealth of developer
   resources and documentation, and general information about how Solid
   works.
