   10 Dos and Don'ts of Classroom Schedules

   Schedules are an essential component to any effective classroom.
   Schedules let us know when transitions will occur, the order of
   activities, and alerts us to changes. For children with autism who may
   struggle with receptive language processing, schedules are even more
   important. Effective use of schedules can increase functional
   independence and decrease negative behaviors and anxiety. However,
   there are some common pitfalls we fall into when it comes to
   appropriate schedule use. Learn my 10 dos and don’ts for classroom
   schedules and make the most out of this must-have strategy!

   Behavior Contingency Maps

   We live in a rule-driven world yet so often our children and adults
   lack the understanding of these guidelines. Behavior Contingency Maps
   show a visual representation of everyday rules. These maps illustrate

   behaviors. These maps are an ABA based intervention and help identify
   the ABC pattern of behavior (antecedent, behavior, consequence) and
   will give your student or child a concrete way of understanding that
   “if, then” relationship – “If you do this, this will happen.” In this
   session, audience members will explore the purpose & use of Behavior
   Contingency Maps as well as  leave ready to implement this strategy
   immediately in an effective and positive way!
