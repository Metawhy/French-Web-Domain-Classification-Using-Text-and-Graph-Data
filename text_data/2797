Do problematic internet use and perceived stress mediate health behaviors and
work-life balance? - An online study with internet-users in Germany and China

   Background: Work-life balance is associated with health behaviors. In
   the face of digitalization, understanding this link requires
   investigating the roles of problematic internet use and perceived
   stress, which are so far unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was
   to explore whether problematic internet use and perceived stress
   mediate health behaviors and work-life balance in two groups of
   internet-users from different environments (residents in Germany or
   China), therefore, also to see if residence was a moderator. Methods:
   An online questionnaire (N=877) was launched with residents from
   Germany (n=374) and China (n=503) in three language versions (German,
   English and Chinese). Moderated mediation analyses were run with health
   behaviors as the independent variable, work-life balance as the
   dependent variable, problematic internet use and perceived stress as
   the mediator variables, and residence as potential moderator. Results:
   Results showed that health behaviors seem to be directly related to
   work-life balance in both groups. In residents of Germany, a partial
   mediation was revealed (β = .13, P = .01), while in residents of China,
   a full mediation was revealed (β = .02, P =.61). The mediation role of
   perceived stress was prominent compared to problematic internet use in
   all of the serial models, and the parallel model. Residence moderated
   the relationship between health behaviors and work-life balance. On a
   mean level, individuals in Germany performed more health behaviors than
   individuals in China, however, have higher perceived stress. The
   interrelation between health behaviors and work-life balance was
   stronger in Germany (β = .19, P < .001), compared in China (β = .11, P
   =.01). Conclusions: These findings are in line with the compensatory
   carry-over action model. To promote work-life balance, individuals
   should perform health behaviors to help overcome problematic internet
   use and perceived stress.

Journal Description

   The Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), now in its 20th year,
   is the pioneer open access eHealth journal and is the flagship journal
   of JMIR Publications. It is the leading digital health journal globally
   in terms of quality/visibility (Impact Factor 2018: 4.945, ranked #1
   out of 26 journals in the medical informatics category) and in terms of
   size (number of papers published). The journal focuses on emerging
   technologies, medical devices, apps, engineering, and informatics
   applications for patient education, prevention, population health and
   clinical care. As a leading high-impact journal in its disciplines
   (health informatics and health services research), it is selective, but
   it is now complemented by almost 30 specialty JMIR sister journals,
   which have a broader scope. Peer-review reports are portable across
   JMIR journals and papers can be transferred, so authors save time by
   not having to resubmit a paper to different journals.

   As an open access journal, we are read by clinicians, allied health
   professionals, informal caregivers, and patients alike, and have (as
   with all JMIR journals) a focus on readable and applied science
   reporting the design and evaluation of health innovations and emerging
   technologies. We publish original research, viewpoints, and reviews
   (both literature reviews and medical device/technology/app reviews).

   We are also a leader in participatory and open science approaches, and
   offer the option to publish new submissions immediately as preprints,
   which receive DOIs for immediate citation (eg, in grant proposals), and
   for open peer-review purposes. We also invite patients to participate
   (eg, as peer-reviewers) and have patient representatives on editorial
   boards.

Abstract:
       Background: Social media (SM) platforms play a vital role in the
       dissemination of health information. However, evidence suggests
       that a high proportion of Twitter posts (ie, tweets) are not
       necessarily accurate, and many studies suggest that tweets do not
       need to be accurate, or at least evidence based, to receive
       traction. This is a dangerous combination in the sphere of health
       information. Objective: The first objective of this study is to
       examine health-related tweets originating from Saudi Arabia in
       terms of their accuracy. The second objective is to find factors
       that relate to the accuracy and dissemination of these tweets,
       thereby enabling the identification of ways to enhance the
       dissemination of accurate tweets. The initial findings from this
       study and methodological improvements will then be employed in a
       larger-scale study that will address these issues in more detail.
       Methods: A health lexicon was used to extract health-related tweets
       using the Twitter application programming interface and the results
       were further filtered manually. A total of 300 tweets were each
       labeled by two medical doctors; the doctors agreed that 109 tweets
       were either accurate or inaccurate. Other measures were taken from
       these tweets’ metadata to see if there was any relationship between
       the measures and either the accuracy or the dissemination of the
       tweets. The entire range of this metadata was analyzed using
       Python, version 3.6.5 (Python Software Foundation), to answer the
       research questions posed. Results: A total of 34 out of 109 tweets
       (31.2%) in the dataset used in this study were classified as
       untrustworthy health information. These came mainly from users with
       a non-health care background and SM accounts that had no
       corresponding physical (ie, organization) manifestation.
       Unsurprisingly, we found that traditionally trusted health sources
       were more likely to tweet accurate health information than other
       users. Likewise, these provisional results suggest that tweets
       posted in the morning are more trustworthy than tweets posted at
       night, possibly corresponding to official and casual posts,
       respectively. Our results also suggest that the crowd was quite
       good at identifying trustworthy information sources, as evidenced
       by the number of times a tweet’s author was tagged as favorited by
       the community. Conclusions: The results indicate some initially
       surprising factors that might correlate with the accuracy of tweets
       and their dissemination. For example, the time a tweet was posted
       correlated with its accuracy, which may reflect a difference
       between professional (ie, morning) and hobbyist (ie, evening)
       tweets. More surprisingly, tweets containing a kashida—a decorative
       element in Arabic writing used to justify the text within
       lines—were more likely to be disseminated through retweets. These
       findings will be further assessed using data analysis techniques on
       a much larger dataset in future work.

Abstract:
       Background: As a consequence of increasing emergency medical
       service (EMS) missions requiring an EMS physician on site, we had
       implemented a unique prehospital telemedical emergency service as a
       new structural component to the conventional physician-based EMS in
       Germany. Objective: We sought to assess the utilization, safety,
       and technical performance of this telemedical emergency service.
       Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all primary
       emergency missions with telemedical consultation of an EMS
       physician in the City of Aachen (250,000 inhabitants) during the
       first 3 operational years of our tele-EMS system. Main outcome
       measures were the number of teleconsultations, number of
       complications, and number of transmission malfunctions during
       teleconsultations. Results: The data of 6265 patients were
       analyzed. The number of teleconsultations increased during the
       run-in period of 4 quarters toward full routine operation from 152
       to 420 missions per quarter. When fully operational, around the
       clock, and providing teleconsultations to 11 mobile ambulances, the
       number of teleconsultations further increased by 25.9 per quarter
       (95% CI 9.1-42.6; P=.009). Only 6 of 6265 patients (0.10%; 95% CI
       0.04%-0.21%) experienced adverse events, all of them not inherent
       in the system of teleconsultations. Technical malfunctions of
       single transmission components occurred from as low as 0.3% (95% CI
       0.2%-0.5%) during two-way voice communications to as high as 1.9%
       (95% CI 1.6%-2.3%) during real-time vital data transmissions.
       Complete system failures occurred in only 0.3% (95% CI 0.2%-0.6%)
       of all teleconsultations. Conclusions: The Aachen prehospital EMS
       is a frequently used, safe, and technically reliable system to
       provide medical care for emergency patients without an EMS
       physician physically present. Noninferiority of the tele-EMS
       physician compared with an on-site EMS physician needs to be
       demonstrated in a randomized trial.

Abstract:
       Background: Many health care organizations around the world have
       implemented health information technologies (ITs) to enhance health
       service efficiency, effectiveness, and safety. Studies have
       demonstrated that promising outcomes of health IT initiatives can
       be obtained when patients and family members participate and engage
       in the adoption, use, and evaluation of these technologies. Despite
       knowing this, there is a lack of health care organizations using
       patient and family engagement strategies to enhance the use and
       adoption of health ITs, specifically. Objective: This study aimed
       to answer the following 3 research questions (RQs): (1) what
       current frameworks or theories have been used to guide patient and
       family engagement in health IT adoption, use, implementation,
       selection, and evaluation?, (2) what studies have been done on
       patient and family engagement strategies in health IT adoption,
       use, implementation, selection, and evaluation?, and (3) what
       patient and family engagement frameworks, studies, or resources
       identified in the literature can be applied to health IT adoption,
       use, implementation, selection, and evaluation? Methods: This
       scoping review used a 5-step framework developed by Arksey and
       O’Malley and adapted by Levac et al. These steps include the
       following: (1) identifying the RQ, (2) identifying relevant
       studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting relevant data, and (5)
       summarizing and reporting the result. Retrieved academic and grey
       literature records were evaluated using a literature review
       software based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by two
       independent reviewers. If consensus was not achieved, two reviewers
       would resolve conflicts by discussion. Research findings and
       strategies were extracted from the studies and summarized in data
       tables. Results: A total of 35 academic articles and 23 gray
       literature documents met the inclusion criteria. In total, 20 of
       the 35 included studies have been published since 2017. Frameworks
       found include the patient engagement framework developed by
       Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and the
       patient and family engagement framework proposed by Carman et al.
       Effective strategies include providing patients with clear
       expectations and responsibilities and providing reimbursement for
       time and travel. The gray literature sources outlined key
       considerations for planning and supporting engagement initiatives
       such as providing patients with professional development
       opportunities, and embedding patients in existing governance
       structures. Conclusions: Several studies have reported their
       findings regarding successful strategies to engage patients and
       family members in health IT initiatives and the positive impact
       that can emerge when patients and family members are engaged in
       such initiatives in an effective manner. Currently, no framework
       has consolidated all of the key strategies and considerations that
       were found in this review to guide health care organizations when
       engaging patients and family members in a health IT–specific
       project or initiative. Further research to evaluate and validate
       the existing strategies would be of value.

Abstract:
       Background: Public policy introduced since 2011 has supported
       provider adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and
       patient-provider messaging, primarily through financial incentives.
       It is unclear how disparities in patients’ use of incentivized
       electronic health (eHealth) tools, like patient-provider messaging,
       have changed over time relative to disparities in use of eHealth
       tools that were not directly incentivized. Objective: This study
       examines trends in eHealth disparities before and after the
       introduction of US federal financial incentives. We compare rates
       of patient-provider messaging, which was directly incentivized,
       with rates of looking for health information on the Web, which was
       not directly incentivized. Methods: We used nationally
       representative Health Information National Trends Survey data from
       2003 to 2018 (N=37,300) to describe disparities in patient-provider
       messaging and looking for health information on the Web. We first
       reported the percentage of individuals across education and racial
       and ethnic groups who reported using these tools in each survey
       year and compared changes in unadjusted disparities during
       preincentive (2003-2011) and postincentive (2011-2018) periods.
       Using multivariable linear probability models, we then examined
       adjusted effects of education and race and ethnicity in 3
       periods—preincentive (2003-2005), early incentive (2011-2013), and
       postincentive (2017-2018)—controlling for sociodemographic and
       health factors. In the postincentive period, an additional model
       tested whether internet adoption, provider access, or providers’
       use of EMRs explained disparities. Results: From 2003 to 2018,
       overall rates of provider messaging increased from 4% to 36%. The
       gap in provider messaging between the highest and lowest education
       groups increased by 10 percentage points preincentive (P<.001) and
       22 additional points postincentive (P<.001). The gap between
       Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites increased by 3.2 points
       preincentive (P=.42) and 11 additional points postincentive
       (P=.01). Trends for blacks resembled those for Hispanics, whereas
       trends for Asians resembled those for non-Hispanic whites. In
       contrast, education-based disparities in looking for health
       information on the Web (which was not directly incentivized) did
       not significantly change in preincentive or postincentive periods,
       whereas racial disparities narrowed by 15 percentage points
       preincentive (P=.008) and did not significantly change
       postincentive. After adjusting for other sociodemographic and
       health factors, observed associations were similar to unadjusted
       associations, though smaller in magnitude. Including internet
       adoption, provider access, and providers’ use of EMRs in the
       postincentive model attenuated, but did not eliminate,
       education-based disparities in provider messaging and looking for
       health information on the Web. Racial and ethnic disparities were
       no longer statistically significant in adjusted models.
       Conclusions: Disparities in provider messaging widened over time,
       particularly following federal financial incentives. Meanwhile,
       disparities in looking for health information on the Web remained
       stable or narrowed. Incentives may have disproportionately
       benefited socioeconomically advantaged groups. Future policy could
       address disparities by incentivizing providers treating these
       populations to adopt messaging capabilities and encouraging
       patients’ use of messaging.

Abstract:
       Background: Timely, in-person access to health care is a challenge
       for people living with conditions such as stroke that result in
       frailty, loss of independence, restrictions in driving and
       mobility, and physical and cognitive decline. In Southeastern
       Ontario, access is further complicated by rurality and the long
       travel distances to visit physician clinics. There is a need to
       make health care more accessible and convenient. Home virtual
       visits (electronic visits, eVisits) can conveniently connect
       physicians to patients. Physicians use a secure personal
       videoconferencing tool to connect to patients in their homes.
       Patients use their device of choice (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or
       desktop) for the visit. Objective: This study aimed to assess the
       feasibility and logistics of implementing eVisits in a stroke
       prevention clinic for seniors. Methods: A 6-month eVisit pilot
       study was initiated in the Kingston Health Sciences Centre stroke
       prevention clinic in August 2018. eVisits were used only for
       follow-up patient encounters. An integrated evaluation was used to
       test the impact of the program on clinic workflow and patient
       satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by telephone
       interviews, using a brief questionnaire. Access and patient
       satisfaction metrics were compared with concurrent standard of care
       (patients’ prior personal experience with in-person visits). Values
       are presented as median (interquartile range). Results: There were
       75 subjects in the pilot. The patients were aged 65 (56-73.5)
       years, and 39% (29/75) resided in rural areas. There was a shorter
       wait for an appointment by eVisit versus in-person (mean 59.98 [SD
       48.36] days vs mean 78.36 [SD 50.54] days; P<.001). The eVisit was
       also shorter, taking on an average of only 10 min to deliver
       follow-up care with a high degree of patient satisfaction versus 90
       (60-112) min for in-person care. The total time saved by patients
       per eVisit was 80 (50-102) min, 44 (21-69) min of which was travel
       time. Travel distance avoided by the patients was 30.1 km
       (11.2-82.2). The estimated total out-of-pocket cost savings for
       patients per eVisit was Can $52.83 (31.26-94.53). The estimated
       savings (opportunity cost for in-person outpatient care) for our
       eVisit pilot project was Can $23,832-$28,584. The patient
       satisfaction with eVisits was very good compared with their prior
       personal experience with in-person outpatient care. Conclusions:
       The eVisit program was well received by patients, deemed to be safe
       by physicians, and avoided unnecessary patient travel and expense.
       It also has the potential to reduce health care costs. We plan to
       scale the project within the department and the institution.

Abstract:
       Background: The beneficial effects of physical activity (PA) for
       older adults are well known. However, few older adults reach the
       health guideline of 150 min per week of moderate-to-vigorous PA
       (MVPA). Electronic health (eHealth) interventions are effective in
       increasing PA levels in older adults in the short term but, rarely,
       intermediate-term effects after a period without the support of a
       website or an app have been examined. Furthermore, current
       theory-based interventions focus mainly on preintentional
       determinants, although postintentional determinants should also be
       included to increase the likelihood of successful behavior change.
       Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of the
       theory-based eHealth intervention, MyPlan 2.0, focusing on pre- and
       postintentional determinants on both accelerometer-based and
       self-reported PA levels in older Belgian adults in the short and
       intermediate term. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled
       trial with 3 data collection points: baseline (N=72), post (5 weeks
       after baseline; N=65), and follow-up (FU; 3 months after baseline;
       N=65). The study took place in Ghent, and older adults (aged ≥65
       years) were recruited through a combination of random and
       convenience sampling. At all the time points, participants were
       visited by the research team. Self-reported domain-specific PA was
       assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire,
       and accelerometers were used to objectively assess PA. Participants
       in the intervention group got access to the eHealth intervention,
       MyPlan 2.0, and used it independently for 5 consecutive weeks after
       baseline. MyPlan 2.0 was based on the self-regulatory theory and
       focused on both pre- and postintentional processes to increase PA.
       Multilevel mixed-models repeated measures analyses were performed
       in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Results: Significant
       (borderline) positive intervention effects were found for
       accelerometer-based MVPA (baseline−FU: intervention group +5 min
       per day and control group −5 min per day; P=.07) and for
       accelerometer-based total PA (baseline−post: intervention group +20
       min per day and control group −24 min per day; P=.05). MyPlan 2.0
       was also effective in increasing self-reported PA, mainly in the
       intermediate term. A positive intermediate-term intervention effect
       was found for leisure-time vigorous PA (P=.02), moderate
       household-related PA (P=.01), and moderate PA in the garden
       (P=.04). Negative intermediate-term intervention effects were found
       for leisure-time moderate PA (P=.01) and cycling for transport
       (P=.07). Conclusions: The findings suggest that theory-based
       eHealth interventions focusing on pre- and postintentional
       determinants have the potential for behavior change in older
       adults. If future studies including larger samples and long-term FU
       can confirm and clarify these findings, researchers and
       practitioners should be encouraged to use a self-regulation
       perspective for eHealth intervention development. Clinical Trial:

Abstract:
       Background: Patient portals are frequently used in modern health
       care systems as an engagement and communication tool. An increased
       focus on the potential value of these communication channels to
       improve health outcomes is warranted. Objective: This paper aimed
       to quantify the impact of portal use on patients’ preventive health
       behavior and chronic health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a
       retrospective, observational cohort study of 10,000 patients aged
       50 years or older who were treated at the University of
       Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) from September 1, 2014, to
       October 31, 2016. The data were sourced from the UPHS electronic
       health records. We investigated the association between patient
       portal use and patients’ preventive health behaviors or chronic
       health outcomes, controlling for confounders using a novel
       cardinality matching approach based on propensity scoring and a
       subsequent bootstrapping method to estimate the variance of
       association estimates. Results: Patient-level characteristics
       differed substantially between portal users, comprising
       approximately 59.32% (5932/10000) of the cohort, and nonusers. On
       average, users were more likely to be younger (63.46 years for
       users vs 66.08 years for nonusers), white (72.77% (4317/5932) for
       users vs 52.58% (2139/4068) for nonusers), have commercial
       insurance (60.99% (3618/5932) for users vs 40.12% (1632/4068) for
       nonusers), and have higher annual incomes (US $74,172/year for
       users vs US $62,940/year for nonusers). Even after adjusting for
       these potential confounders, patient portal use had a positive and
       clinically meaningful impact on patients’ preventive health
       behaviors but not on chronic health outcomes. Conclusions: This
       paper contributes to the understanding of the impact of patient
       portal use on health outcomes and is the first study to identify a
       meaningful subgroup of patients’ health behaviors that improved
       with portal use. These findings may encourage providers to promote
       portal use to improve patients’ preventive health behaviors.

Abstract:
       Background: A Web-based dietary assessment tool—RiksmatenFlex—was
       developed for the national dietary survey of adolescents in Sweden.
       Objective: This study aimed to describe the Web-based method
       RiksmatenFlex and to test the validity of the reported dietary
       intake by comparing dietary intake with 24-hour dietary recalls
       (recall interviews), estimated energy expenditure, and biomarkers.
       Methods: Adolescents aged 11-12, 14-15, and 17-18 years were
       recruited through schools. In total, 78 students had complete
       dietary information and were included in the study. Diet was
       reported a few weeks apart with either RiksmatenFlexDiet (the day
       before and a random later day) or recall interviews (face-to-face,
       a random day later by phone) in a cross-over, randomized design. At
       a school visit, weight and height were measured and blood samples
       were drawn for biomarker analyses. Students wore an accelerometer
       for 7 days for physical activity measurements. Dietary intake
       captured by both dietary methods was compared, and energy intake
       captured by both methods was compared with the
       accelerometer-estimated energy expenditure (EEest). Intake of whole
       grain wheat and rye and fruit and vegetables by both methods was
       compared with alkylresorcinol and carotenoid concentrations in
       plasma, respectively. Results: The mean of the reported energy
       intake was 8.92 (SD 2.77) MJ by RiksmatenFlexDiet and 8.04 (SD
       2.67) MJ by the recall interviews (P=.01). Intake of fruit and
       vegetables was 224 (169) g and 227 (150) g, and whole grain wheat
       and rye intake was 12.4 (SD 13.2) g and 12.0 (SD 13.1) g,
       respectively; the intakes of fruit and vegetables as well as whole
       grain wheat and rye did not differ between methods. Intraclass
       correlation coefficients ranged from 0.57 for protein and
       carbohydrates to 0.23 for vegetables. Energy intake by
       RiksmatenFlexDiet was overreported by 8% (P=.03) but not by the
       recall interviews (P=.53) compared with EEest. The Spearman
       correlation coefficient between reported energy intake and EEest
       was 0.34 (P=.008) for RiksmatenFlexDiet and 0.16 (P=.21) for the
       recall interviews. Spearman correlation coefficient between whole
       grain wheat and rye and plasma total alkylresorcinol homologs was
       0.36 (P=.002) for RiksmatenFlexDiet and 0.29 (P=.02) for the recall
       interviews. Spearman correlations between intake of fruit and
       vegetables and plasma carotenoids were weak for both dietary tools.
       The strongest correlations were observed between fruit and
       vegetable intake and lutein/zeaxanthin for RiksmatenFlexDiet (0.46;
       P<.001) and for recall interviews (0.28; P=.02). Conclusions:
       RiksmatenFlexDiet provides information on energy, fruit,
       vegetables, and whole grain wheat and rye intake, which is
       comparable with intake obtained from recall interviews in Swedish
       adolescents. The results are promising for cost-effective dietary
       data collection in upcoming national dietary surveys and other
       studies in Sweden. Future research should focus on how, and if, new
       technological solutions could reduce dietary reporting biases.

Abstract:
       Background: The opioid epidemic has ravaged rural communities in
       the United States. Despite extensive literature relating the
       physical environment to substance use in urban areas, little is
       known about the role of physical environment on the opioid epidemic
       in rural areas. Objective: This study aimed to examine the
       reliability of Google Earth to collect data on the physical
       environment related to substance use in rural areas. Methods:
       Systematic virtual audits were performed in 5 rural Kentucky
       counties using Google Earth between 2017 and 2018 to capture land
       use, health care facilities, entertainment venues, and businesses.
       In-person audits were performed for a subset of the census blocks.
       Results: We captured 533 features, most of which were images taken
       before 2015 (71.8%, 383/533). Reliability between the virtual
       audits and the gold standard was high for health care facilities
       (>83%), entertainment venues (>95%), and businesses (>61%) but was
       poor for land use features (>18%). Reliability between the virtual
       audit and in-person audit was high for health care facilities (83%)
       and entertainment venues (62%) but was poor for land use (0%) and
       businesses (12.5%). Conclusions: Poor reliability for land use
       features may reflect difficulty characterizing features that
       require judgment or natural changes in the environment that are not
       reflective of the Google Earth imagery because it was captured
       several years before the audit was performed. Virtual Google Earth
       audits were an efficient way to collect rich neighborhood data that
       are generally not available from other sources. However, these
       audits should use caution when the images in the observation area
       are dated.

Abstract:
       Background: Being socially connected is related to well-being, and
       one way of avoiding social isolation is to deepen existing
       relationships. Even though existing relationships can be reinforced
       by regular and meaningful communication, state-of-the-art
       communication technologies alone do not increase the quality of
       social connections. Thus, there is a need for the involvement of a
       trained human facilitator in a network of older adults, preferably
       for a short period, to promote the deepening of their
       relationships. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the
       hypothesis that a human-facilitated, media-sharing social
       networking system can improve social connection in a small group of
       older people, who are more vulnerable to social isolation than
       most, and deepen their relationships over a period of a few weeks.
       Methods: We conducted the design and evaluation of Media Parcels, a
       novel human-facilitated social networking system. Media Parcels is
       based on the metaphor of a facilitator collecting and delivering
       parcels in the physical mail. Extending the metaphor, the system
       supports a facilitator in designing time-based dialogue requesting
       parcels from participants that bring out their memories and
       feelings, in collecting the parcels, wrapping them in annotations
       that communicate the corresponding requests, and delivering the
       wrapped parcel to a target person. Qualitative evaluation was
       carried out in 2 trials with a group of 3 people each, one with
       family members (children and father; aged 55, 56, and 82 years old)
       and the other with a group of friends (aged 72, 72, and 74 years
       old), over 2 weeks. In each trial, data were collected in 3
       interviews (pre-, mid-, and posttrial) and via system logging.
       Results: Collected data indicate positive social effects for
       deepening and developing relationships. The parcel metaphor was
       easily understood and the computational system was readily adopted.
       Preferences with regard to media production or consumption varied
       among participants. In the family group, children preferred
       receiving media parcels (because of their sentimental value) to
       producing them, whereas the father enjoyed both. In the friendship
       group, preferences varied: one friend enjoyed both producing and
       receiving, while the other two preferred one over the other. In
       general, participants reported a preference for the production of
       items of a certain type depending on the associated content. Apart
       from having a strong engagement with the system, participants
       reported feeling closer to each other than usual. Conclusions: For
       both groups, Media Parcels was effective in promoting media sharing
       and social connections, resulting in the deepening of existing
       relationships. Its design informs researchers who are attempting to
       promote social connection in older adults.

       Background: Work-life balance is associated with health behaviors.
       In the face of digitalization, understanding this link requires
       investigating the roles of problematic internet use and perceived
       stress, which are so far unknown. Objective: The aim of this study
       was to explore whether problematic internet use and perceived
       stress mediate health behaviors and work-life balance in two groups
       of internet-users from different environments (residents in Germany
       or China), therefore, also to see if residence was a moderator.
       Methods: An online questionnaire (N=877) was launched with
       residents from Germany (n=374) and China (n=503) in three language
       versions (German, English and Chinese). Moderated mediation
       analyses were run with health behaviors as the independent
       variable, work-life balance as the dependent variable, problematic
       internet use and perceived stress as the mediator variables, and
       residence as potential moderator. Results: Results showed that
       health behaviors seem to be directly related to work-life balance
       in both groups. In residents of Germany, a partial mediation was
       revealed (β = .13, P = .01), while in residents of China, a full
       mediation was revealed (β = .02, P =.61). The mediation role of
       perceived stress was prominent compared to problematic internet use
       in all of the serial models, and the parallel model. Residence
       moderated the relationship between health behaviors and work-life
       balance. On a mean level, individuals in Germany performed more
       health behaviors than individuals in China, however, have higher
       perceived stress. The interrelation between health behaviors and
       work-life balance was stronger in Germany (β = .19, P < .001),
       compared in China (β = .11, P =.01). Conclusions: These findings
       are in line with the compensatory carry-over action model. To
       promote work-life balance, individuals should perform health
       behaviors to help overcome problematic internet use and perceived
       stress.

       Background: Cancellations and rescheduling of doctor’s appointments
       are common. An automated rescheduling system has the potential to
       facilitate rescheduling process so that newly opened slots are
       promptly filled by patients who need and can take the slot.
       Building on an existing online patient portal, a large healthcare
       system adopted an automated rescheduling system, called Fast Pass,
       that sends out an earlier appointment offer via email or text alert
       to patients and allows patients to reschedule their appointment
       through the online portal. Objective: We examined the uptake of
       Fast Pass at its early stage of implementation. We assessed program
       features and patient and visit characteristics associated with
       higher levels of Fast Pass utilization and association between Fast
       Pass use and no-show and cancellation rates. Methods: This study
       was a retrospective analysis of Fast Pass offers sent between July
       and December 2018. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
       assess the independent contribution of program, patient, and visit
       characteristics on the likelihood of accepting the offer. We then
       assessed appointment outcome (completion, cancellation, or no-show)
       of Fast Pass offered appointments compared to appointments with the
       same patient and visit characteristics but without an offer.
       Results: Of 177,311 Fast Pass offers sent, 8.3% were accepted.
       Overall, there were 1.3 percentage points (or 38%) reduction in
       no-show rates among Fast Pass accepted appointments than other
       appointments with matching characteristics (P < .001). The offers
       were more likely to be accepted if they were sent in the evening
       (vs. early morning), the first (vs. repeated) offer for the same
       appointment, for a slot 1-31 days ahead (vs. same-day), for later
       in a day (vs. before 10am), for primary care (vs. specialty) visit,
       sent via text message (vs. email only), for an appointment made
       through patient online portal (vs. via phone call or in-person), or
       for younger adults aged 18-49 (vs. ≥65) (all at P < .001). Factors
       negatively associated with offer acceptance were increasing number
       of comorbidities (P = .02) and visits scheduled for chronic
       conditions (vs. acute conditions only) (P = .002). Conclusions: An
       automated rescheduling system can improve patient’s access by
       reducing wait time for an appointment, with an added benefit of
       preventing no-shows by serving as a reminder of an upcoming
       appointment. Future modifications, such as increasing adoption of
       text-based offers and targeting older adults or patients with
       complex conditions, may help promote wider utilization and

       Background: As digital technology use in society increases, so does
       the need for health professionals to engage in eHealth-enabled
       clinical practice. To do so, higher education institutions need to
       suitably prepare graduates of health professional degrees with the
       capabilities required to practice in eHealth contexts. Objective:
       This study aimed to understand how eHealth is taught at a major
       Australian University, and the challenges and suggestions for
       integrating eHealth into allied health, nursing and medical
       university curricula. Methods: Cross-disciplinary subject unit
       outlines (N=77) were reviewed for eHealth-related content, and
       interviews and focus groups conducted with the corresponding
       subject unit coordinators (N=26). Content analysis was used to
       identify themes around challenges and opportunities for embedding
       eHealth in teaching. Results: There was no evidence of a
       standardised approach to eHealth teaching across any of the health
       degrees at the university. Where eHealth content existed, it tended
       to focus on clinical applications rather than systems and policies,
       data analysis and knowledge creation, or system and technology
       implementation. Despite identifying numerous challenges to
       embedding eHealth in their subjects, unit coordinators expressed
       enthusiasm for eHealth teaching and were keen to adjust content and
       learning activities. Conclusions: Explicit strategies are required
       to address how eHealth capabilities can be embedded across clinical
       health degrees. Unit coordinators require support including access
       to relevant information, teaching resources, and curriculum mapping
       that clearly articulates eHealth capabilities for students across
       their degree. Degree-wide conversations and collaboration is
       required between professional bodes, clinical practice, and the
       universities for overcoming the practical and perceived challenges
       of integrating eHealth in health curricula.

       Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is among the most
       prevalent non-communicable health conditions worldwide, affecting
       over 500 million people globally. Diet is a key aspect of T2DM
       management with dietary modification shown to elicit clinically
       meaningful outcomes such as improved glycemic control, and
       reductions in weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
       Web-based interventions provide a potentially convenient and
       accessible method for delivering dietary education but its effects
       on dietary behavior in people with T2DM are unknown. Objective: The
       objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of
       web-based interventions on dietary behavior change and glycemic
       control in people with T2DM. Methods: In accordance with PRISMA
       guidelines, systematic literature searches were performed using
       Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to retrieve
       papers from January 2013 to May 2019. Randomized controlled trials
       of web-based interventions in adults with T2DM with reported
       dietary assessment were included. Population and intervention
       characteristics, dietary guidelines and assessments, and
       significant clinical outcomes were extracted. Differences between
       groups and within groups were assessed for dietary behavior and
       clinical outcomes. Results: There were 714 records screened and
       five studies comprising 1056 adults were included. Studies measured
       dietary changes by assessing overall diet quality, changes in
       specific dietary components, or dietary knowledge scores.
       Significant improvements in dietary behavior were reported in four
       out of the five studies, representing healthier food choices,
       improvements in eating habits, reductions in carbohydrates, added
       sugar, sodium, saturated fat and overall fat intake, and/or
       increases in dietary knowledge. Three studies found significant
       mean reductions for hemoglobin A1c ranging from –0.3% to –0.8%,
       and/or weight ranging from –2.3 kg to –12.7 kg, fasting blood
       glucose (–1 mmol/L), waist circumference (–1 cm), and triglycerides
       (–60.1 mg/dL). These studies provided varied dietary
       recommendations from standard dietary guidelines, national health
       program guidelines, and a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet.
       Conclusions: Web-based interventions are effective for supporting
       dietary behavior change in adults with T2DM in most cases, though
       changes in glycemic control and other clinical outcomes are
       inconsistent. There was considerable heterogeneity in the diets
       recommended and the dietary assessment measures used across all
       studies, therefore, more research is needed to determine whether
       these effects are sufficiently greater than those achieved through
       usual care.

       Background: Dengue fever (DF), the world’s most rapidly spreading
       mosquito-borne disease, causes approximately 50 million cases a
       year, putting an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk in 128
       countries. For the last 10 years, mobile phones have provided the
       global health community with innovative and cost-effective
       strategies to address the challenges in the prevention and
       management of DF. Objective: In this paper, we have introduced and
       described the design and development process of Mozzify, an
       integrated mobile health (mHealth) application that features
       real-time DF cases reporting and mapping system, health
       communication (real-time reporting and mapping of DF cases,
       real-time worldwide news and chat forum (timeline), within-app
       educational videos, local and international health agencies
       websites and interactive signs and symptoms checker and hospital
       directions system), and behavior modification (reminders alert
       program on the preventive practices against DF). We also sought to
       assess Mozzify in terms of engagement and information-sharing
       abilities, functionality, aesthetic, subjective quality and
       perceived impact. Methods: We have developed and designed a mobile
       application, Mozzify, which main goals were to increase awareness,
       knowledge and attitude on DF, increase healthcare-seeking behavior
       and increase intention to change behavior on preventive practices
       against DF among users. It was initially assessed using the Mobile
       Application Rating Scale (MARS), among 50 purposively sampled
       individuals which were consisted of public health experts (PHE) (n
       = 5), environment and health-related researchers (EHR) (n = 23) and
       non-clinical (end-users) (n = 22) participants. Results: High
       acceptability and excellent satisfaction ratings (≥4.0 mean scores
       out of 5) based from the MARS subscales indicate that the app has
       excellent user design, functionality, usability, engagement, and
       contains relevant information system, app subjective and specific
       quality among PHE, HER and end-users. Some issues and suggestions
       were raised during the focus group and individual discussions on
       the availability of the app in Android; language options
       limitations, provision on predictive surveillance, and inclusion of
       other mosquito-borne diseases. Conclusions: We have learned that,
       Mozzify can be a promising integrated strategic health intervention
       system in DF cases reporting and mapping system, raising knowledge,
       awareness and attitude and disseminating and sharing information on
       DF among general population and health experts and can be an
       effective aid in the successful translation of knowledge on
       preventive measures against DF to practice.

       Background: Computer-aided Detection (CAD) is increasingly being
       used as an aid tool by radiologists on breast lesion diagnosis.
       Previous studies demonstrated that CAD can improve the diagnosis
       performance of radiologist. However, the optimal use of CAD in
       breast lesions less and more than 2cm has not been mentioned.
       Objective: To compare the performance of different radiologists by
       using CAD to detect breast cancer in size less and more than 2cm.
       Methods: We prospectively enrolled 261 consecutive patients (mean
       age, 43years; age range, 17–70 years), 398 lesions (148 more than
       2cm, 79 with malignant, 69 with benign; 250 less or equal to 2cm,
       71 with malignant, 179 with benign), with breast mass as prominent
       symptom. One novice radiologist with 1 year of US experience and
       one experienced radiologist with 5 years of US experience were
       assigned to read US images without CAD, and at a second reading
       combined with CAD. Diagnostic performances were compared by using
       analysis of variance. Results: For novice reader, the area under
       the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.743
       (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.669, 0.817) at without-CAD mode to
       0.884 (95% CI: 0.834, 0.933; P＜.001) at the combined-CAD mode in
       lesions less or equal to 2cm, for experienced reader those were
       from 0.838(95% CI :0.773,0.903) to 0.902(95% CI :0.862,0.942;
       P=.002). Those were from 0.806 to 0.797(novice reader) and 0.895 to
       0.822 (experienced reader) in lesions more than 2cm. The
       sensitivity of novice and experienced reader in lesions less than
       2cm improved from 61.97% and 73.23% at without-CAD mode to 90.14%
       and 97.18% at combined-CAD mode, respectively. Conclusions:
       Computer-aided detection (CAD) was helpful for novice and
       experienced reader to improve cancer detection at breast US in
       lesions less than 2cm. CAD was more sensitive for both novice and
       experienced reader. Clinical Trial: ChiCTR1800019649
