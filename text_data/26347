   I am Professor of Finance (Management Sciences), University of Bordeaux
   (faculty of economics and management) which I joined in September
   2013.; my former position was at the Sorbonne Graduate Business School
   (IAE de Paris – Institut d’Administration des Entreprise), University
   of Paris 1 institution with whom I still collaborate.

   My research topics are Agent-Based Computational Finance, Asset
   Management and Complexity in Finance. From this page, you can access my
   vita and a list of selected publications (research), a series of
   teaching resources (students’ area) and a webpage where some applets of
   my own are proposed to illustrate various agent-based simulations .

Research

   My research focuses around three main topics:
     * Portfolio Management and risk management.
     * Price formation process on modern financial stock exchanges, with a
       specific interest for market micro-structure, social interaction
       and decision-making.
     * Coordination, market complexity and regulatory institutions (norms,
       beliefs, conventions, reputation)

     * DBLP
     * REPEC

Computational Finance

   From the menu you can access three different aspects of my works I have
   gathered under the denomination « Computational Finance » :

   « Multi Agent Systems in Finance«   is a field at the borders of
   Computer Science and Finance that allows to develope experiments in a
   totally controlled environment. It is grounded on Multi-Agents Systems,
   a software engineering technique ideally suited for modelling complex
   adaptive system.

   « Softwares » presents projects I contribute on.

   « Tips in Computational Finance » presents some examples of codes that
   may interest my students or those who use R or Netlogo in Finance
