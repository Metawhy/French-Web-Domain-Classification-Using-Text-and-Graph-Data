Overview

   W-SEPT is a collaborative research project focusing on worst-case
   execution time guarantees. The main goal is to improve the precision
   and the traceability of semantics information through the compilation
   flow, from high-level description (such as the Lustre synchronous
   language) down to C and binary levels.

   W-SEPT started on October 1st, 2012, and runs for 42 months.

   W-SEPT is funded by ANR under grant ANR-12-INSE-0001, and supported by
   the  competitiveness clusters (pôles de compétitivité) Aerospace Valley
   and Minalogic.
