What is Keto?

   The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb diet that
   causes ketones to be produced by the liver, shifting the body's
   metabolism away from glucose and towards fat utilisation.

   According to over sixty randomized controlled trials carbohydrate
   restriction is the most effective weight loss tool due to its appetite
   suppressing effects. The benefits of healthy low carb eating extend
   beyond weight loss and the ketogenic diet has been used as adjuvant
   treatment for several health conditions.

My Story

   Hi, I'm Martina, the creator of the KetoDiet blog, KetoDiet app &
   International best selling author

   I love food, science, photography and creating new recipes and I am a
   firm believer in low-carb living and regular exercise. As a science
   geek, I base my views on valid research and I have first-hand
   experience of what it is to be on a low-carb diet. Both are reflected
   on my blog, in my apps and cookbooks.

   I currently live in the UK. I hold a degree in Economics and worked in
   auditing, but I have always been passionate about nutrition and healthy
   living.

   I changed the way I ate in 2011, when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s,
   an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid. I had no energy, and I
   found it more and more difficult to maintain a healthy weight.

   That’s when I decided to quit sugar, grains, and processed foods, and
   to start following a whole-foods-based low carb approach to food.

   My mission is to help you reach your goals, whether it's your dream
   weight or simply eating healthy food.
