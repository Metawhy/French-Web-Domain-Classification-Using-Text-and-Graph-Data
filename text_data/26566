8 Japanese Adventures That Will Literally Change Your Life

   ANA logo + Travel&Leisure

   We partnered with ANA (All Nippon Airways) to show that the myriad
   wonders of Japan are closer than ever before.

   Visiting Japan is, in and of itself, life-changing for many
   travelers—its unique customs, ever-present history, and dramatic
   topography are apparent the second you step off the plane and realize
   you’re in for a transformative journey. Even within Japan, however,
   there are those experiences that go above and beyond in terms of the
   influence they have on travelers after they’ve taken the flight home.
   As such, we’ve rounded up eight of the most quintessential Japanese
   adventures from around this incredible country, all of which are sure
   to stay with you forever.
   Seeing the cherry blossoms in full bloom

Seeing the cherry blossoms in full bloom

   Cherry blossoms, or sakura, are popular in Japan because their bloom
   cycle mirrors the ephemerality of life, an essential tenet of Buddhist
   philosophy. After they flower, the delicate blossoms drift to the
   ground petal by petal in a gentle rain of beauty. You can picnic or
   walk under the blossoms all over Japan, but at Hirosaki Castle in the
   city of Hirosaki, the spectacle involves so many trees—2,600—that it
   feels like walking through pink snow.

   Eating fresh uni right out of the shell

Eating fresh uni right out of the shell

   There’s a pleasant funkiness to the delicacy of uni, or sea urchin,
   that’s part of the appeal. Or is there? At Omicho fish market in
   Kanazawa—one of the oldest, most respected fish markets in Japan—stalls
   feature fresh, spiky uni shells with the glistening orange meat, which
   a fishmonger will serve to you with soy sauce and chopsticks. This uni
   will be so sweet, you may have to change your sayings and general
   seafood philosophy.

   work, they are equally obsessed with completely shutting off. Bring an
   ounce of onsen-style peace back to your everyday life and it may change
   your stress levels forever.

   Vintage shopping in Shinjuku

Vintage shopping in Shinjuku

   Normally, when vintage shopping, you have to sort through mountains of
   stuff to find the one piece you’ll wear every day. In Shinjuku, Tokyo’s
   shopping paradise, you may find exactly the opposite—heaps of fashion
   gold from world-famous high fashion and streetwear brands. There are
   wild shoes and flawless coats and structured skirts and rock-band tees.
   And at stores like Ragtag, where people relinquish their barely used
   items, you can find many of these things for less than the price of
   some meals.
   See More
   Skiing in Hokkaido

Skiing in Hokkaido

   One reason pros have recently become obsessed with skiing in Japan is
   the feathery snow that falls on the country’s mountains. Another is
   just how much of that light, perfect snow there is. Resorts such as
   Niseko and Furano on the island of Hokkaido can receive up to 55 feet
   of it a year. With so much white stuff, you may want to hire your own
   videographer to catch you coming down the mountain looking like a
   powdered donut.

   Finding surreal art on an island

Finding surreal art on an island

   When the chairman of Benesse Holdings bought Naoshima, an island south
   of Tamano, in 1987, he hired renowned architect Tadeo Ando to develop
   it. The result is an enigmatic space full of large-scale art pieces,
   surreal buildings, underground labyrinths, and beauty you won’t find
   anywhere else in the world. As you wander, you may come across work by
   Claude Monet, Andy Warhol, or Yayoi Kusama, placed perfectly in harmony
   with views of the sun and the sea.
   See More
   sumo wrestler

Rooting for your favorite sumo wrestler

   Six times a year, Japan’s most expertly trained sumo wrestlers meet at
   honbasho, or “real tournaments,” to test their strength and ability.
   The tournaments take place all over the country, depending on the
   month, and the athletes are so powerful and efficient that it is not
   uncommon to walk in knowing nothing about sumo and walk out with a
   slate of favorites. The good news: Matches last 15 days, so you can
   continue supporting your champions on TV at sports bars anywhere in
   Japan.

   Drinking a picture-perfect cocktail

Drinking a picture-perfect cocktail

   Cocktails in Japan aren’t just well-constructed—they’re practically
   art. Bartenders at places like Gen Yamamoto, Bar High Five, and Ben
   Fiddich in Tokyo may ask you for your preferred liquor and flavor
   profile, then fastidiously construct you a gorgeous masterpiece using
   evaporators, extracts, droppers, and even smoke. For those used to a
   simple mixed drink, it’s a luxury to have someone pay such attention to
   detail in your honor, as if you were a respected house guest rather
   than a traveler. Bring a camera.

   Japan will be an adventure you’ll never forget. Book your trip today.

   just how much of that light, perfect snow there is. Resorts such as
   Niseko and Furano on the island of Hokkaido can receive up to 55 feet
   of it a year. With so much white stuff, you may want to hire your own
   videographer to catch you coming down the mountain looking like a
   powdered donut.

   Finding surreal art on an island

Finding surreal art on an island

   When the chairman of Benesse Holdings bought Naoshima, an island south
   of Tamano, in 1987, he hired renowned architect Tadeo Ando to develop
   it. The result is an enigmatic space full of large-scale art pieces,
   surreal buildings, underground labyrinths, and beauty you won’t find
   anywhere else in the world. As you wander, you may come across work by
   Claude Monet, Andy Warhol, or Yayoi Kusama, placed perfectly in harmony
   with views of the sun and the sea.

   sumo wrestler

Rooting for your favorite sumo wrestler

   Six times a year, Japan’s most expertly trained sumo wrestlers meet at
   honbasho, or “real tournaments,” to test their strength and ability.
   The tournaments take place all over the country, depending on the
   month, and the athletes are so powerful and efficient that it is not
   uncommon to walk in knowing nothing about sumo and walk out with a
   slate of favorites. The good news: Matches last 15 days, so you can
   continue supporting your champions on TV at sports bars anywhere in
   Japan.

   Drinking a picture-perfect cocktail

Drinking a picture-perfect cocktail

   Cocktails in Japan aren’t just well-constructed—they’re practically
   art. Bartenders at places like Gen Yamamoto, Bar High Five, and Ben
   Fiddich in Tokyo may ask you for your preferred liquor and flavor
   profile, then fastidiously construct you a gorgeous masterpiece using
   evaporators, extracts, droppers, and even smoke. For those used to a
   simple mixed drink, it’s a luxury to have someone pay such attention to
   detail in your honor, as if you were a respected house guest rather
   than a traveler. Bring a camera.
