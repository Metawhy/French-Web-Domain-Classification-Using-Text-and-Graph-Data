A new war rages in Myanmar

   The Arakan Army, Myanmar‚Äôs newest and least known insurgent group, is
   tilting the already volatile Rakhine region towards all-out war

   The Arakan Army, one of Myanmar‚Äôs newest and least known insurgent
   groups, has been hurled from obscurity to prominence after a series of
   escalated attacks that threaten to tilt the country‚Äôs already volatile
   Rakhine state towards all-out war.

   On January 4, Myanmar‚Äôs Independence Day from British colonial rule,
   the Arakan Army staged one of their most brazen and belligerent attacks
   after several weeks of expanded ambushes and engagements with Myanmar
   security forces.

   In Buthidaung township, in the early morning, Arakan Army soldiers
   staged coordinated attacks on four camps of paramilitary Border Guard
   Police (BGP). The military‚Äôs media arm, Myawady Daily, reported on
   January 5 that Arakan Army insurgents attacked the bases in greater
   numbers than reportedly ever used before.

   100 Arakan Army soldiers attacked the BGP base at Ngamyinbaw, 100 at
   Kyaungtaung, 100 at Khahtihla, and 50 at Gokpi, the report said.

   Thirteen BGP troops were killed in the attacks, with two of the police
   stations completely overrun. The insurgents took a number of prisoners
   who were later released as they withdrew. There are no credible
   estimates of Arakan Army or state security force casualties in the
   recent ramped up fighting.

   The Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, has responded by deploying an
   unknown number of troops to the area, by road, air and river craft,
   including a number of units from crack Light Infantry Divisions (LIDs)
   no‚Äôs 22 and 99.

   Attack helicopters have been used by state forces, including during a
   four-hour firefight between 50 Arakan Army soldiers and a Tatmadaw unit
   in Buthidaung Township on January 13. The size and relative
   sophistication of these ambushes came as a surprise to military and
   government leaders, who reacted with a show of unusual unity and
   resolve.

   A rare meeting of senior civilian government and military officials on
   January 7, attended by President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San
   Suu Kyi, and Commander in Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, marked
   possibly the first assembly of the high level officials since the
   National League of Democracy government came to power in March 2016.

   According to state media, the officials discussed ‚Äúthe topic of Rakhine
   state and border security matters‚Äù, and the December 21 ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô
   called by Min Aung Hlaing to pause Tatmadaw operations from December
   21, 2018 to April 30 of this year to pursue bilateral peace talks with
   northern Myanmar-based insurgent groups.

   The military has accused other northern ethnic armed organizations of
   breaching the December 21 suspension and have tried to cast blame on
   the Arakan Army. The ceasefire process in the country‚Äôs north,
   northeast and west is effectively dead, despite the Tatmadaw‚Äôs dubious
   overtures.

   Local commentator Maung Maung Soe told one of Myanmar‚Äôs online
   political talk-shows that this was the first time the NLD government
   had formally instructed the Tatmadaw to attack a specific armed group,
   although the civilian government is at times as belligerent as the
   military in demanding recalcitrant rebels capitulate.

   The president‚Äôs spokesman, Zaw Htay, told a press conference on January
   7 that the Arakan Army was a ‚Äúterrorist organization‚Äù that had contacts
   with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), including an alleged
   meeting of the two groups in Bangladesh, and that the government had
   vowed to ‚Äúcrush the terrorists.‚Äù

   The spokesman further threatened the Rakhine population at large: ‚ÄúDo
   they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades?‚Ä¶I want to tell
   Rakhine people who are supporting (the Arakan Army): Don‚Äôt think about
   yourself, but think about your next generation.‚Äù

   The Arakan Army‚Äôs political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA),
   said in a statement on the same day as the government‚Äôs high level
   security meeting, that it has never had any contact with ARSA while
   vowing to continue its resistance against the government.

   ARSA stands accused of launching raids on border police outposts in
   August 2017 that sparked the Tatmadaw‚Äôs now notorious ‚Äúarea clearance‚Äù
   operations in Rakhine state that drive over 700,000 Rohingya across the
   border into Bangladesh.

   The Arakan Army, which has gradually built up a significant armed
   presence, with some estimates of as many as 3,000 soldiers in the
   region, appears resolute and ready to pursue its so-called ‚ÄòWay of
   Rakhita‚Äô rebellion against Myanmar state rule.

   In an interview with The Irrawaddy magazine on January 10, Arakan Army
   leader Major General Tun Myat Naing said that Tatmadaw reinforcements
   were arriving in the area, and that ‚Äú(I)t is very likely that future
   clashes will be fierce‚Ä¶we will retaliate.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI heard (officials) say that Rakhine will be completely ruined in the
   next 10 years or so, and that Rakhine will meet the same fate as Syria.
   So I believe that if they want to destroy our land, we should destroy
   their (majority Burman) land. However, we are open to peace talks if
   our presence in Rakhine state is recognized.‚Äù

   It‚Äôs operational presence in key townships of northern and central
   Rakhine, including in Buthidaung, Rathedaung, Ponnangyun, and Kyuaktaw
   townships, along with a strong presence in Paletwa township in Chin
   state, will make any Tatmadaw operation logistically challenging.

   So, too, will the Arakan Army‚Äôs suspected access to safe havens in
   bordering Bangladesh and India.
   Leaders of the Arakan Army, ethnic rebel group, gather with other rebel
   leaders and representatives of various Myanmar ethnic rebel groups at
   the opening of a four-day conference in Mai Ja Yang, a town controlled
   by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in northern Kachin State on July
   26, 2016.The conference is organized by the rebel leaders ahead of the
   August planned peace conference by Aung San Suu Kyi's new civilian-led
   government. Suu Kyi has made peace a flagship policy of her new
   government, which took over in March after decades of brutal junta rule
   while conflicts continue to rage in several areas between ethnic
   minority armed groups and the army. Some 240,000 people have been
   displaced nationwide due to unrest and communal conflict. / AFP PHOTO /

   Ethnic Rakhine public support for the Arakan Army has been rising in
   recent years, and these latest attacks could lead to greater antipathy
   towards the Myanmar state and military, further bedeviling Rakhine‚Äôs
   immense development challenges and a deteriorating humanitarian
   situation.

   In a related development, on January 14, the Rakhine High Court upheld
   the decision of a lower court to bring to trial Dr Aye Maung, a former
   Arakan National Party leader who is facing charges of high treason and
   public mischief, along with a prominent Rakhine writer, for making
   anti-government remarks at a public event a year ago.

   Aye Maung had expressed public support for the Arakan Army, speech that
   has seen scores of Rakhine political activists and even Buddhist monks
   imprisoned for breaches of the colonial era 1908 Unlawful Association
   Act.

   Significantly, the appeal of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe,
   both jailed on Official Secrets Act convictions, was upheld on January
   11 in part on the fact that Wa Lone had phone numbers of Arakan Army
   leaders in one of his old notebooks.

   The jailed journalist claims he never used the contacts. But this small
   detail was included in the widely criticized verdict to uphold their
   internationally condemned seven year sentences.

   The government‚Äôs counter-terrorist rhetoric against the Arakan Army is
   entering dangerous new territory. The only armed group to be publicly
   and officially designated a terrorist organization under the 2014
   Anti-Terrorism Law is ARSA.

   The government has refrained from labeling other armed groups under the
   2014 law, potentially to avoid a moral equivalence of Myanmar‚Äôs long-
   standing ethnic armed rebels with the reviled Rohingya minority.

   The military-controlled ministry of home affairs reputedly maintains a
   secret terrorist list, as well as a list of reputedly unlawful
   associations. That opens the possibility of new arrests and
   investigations under the anti-terror law, as authorities have already
   done for several years with Rakhine civilians under unlawful
   associations.

   But it is unclear if the AA will be formally designated a terrorist
   organization, which would complicate possible future peace talks.

   The Tatmadaw‚Äôs anti-AA rhetoric is laden with messages of betrayal and
   advantage, claiming that police and army units were configured to
   respond to the potential for ARSA attacks, none of which have been
   officially acknowledged by ARSA since an ambush in Maungdaw one year
   ago.

   Brigadier General Myint Toe, commander of the No 1 Border Guard Police
   Garrison in north Rakhine state, told the Myanmar media, ‚ÄúWhen we paid
   attention to the possible attacks of the ARSA, the AA launched
   well-organized attack on the police outposts. It was a stab in the
   back‚Ä¶the AA took political advantage as to its attack.‚Äù

   Conflating the Arakan Army with ARSA will likely be detrimental to
   Myanmar public perceptions of often maligned Rakhine grievances towards
   the central government, and fuel further resentment from ethnic Rakhine
   communities, both inside Rakhine state and among large internal migrant
   worker communities where Rakhine often toil in underpaid and unsafe
   occupations.

   International reactions to the January 4 attacks have been largely of
   silent bewilderment at the emergence of a barely understood armed group
   that has often been eclipsed by the humanitarian catastrophe facing the
   Rohingya minority since 2012.

   The heads of missions of the European Union and EU delegation has been
   one of only a few Western embassies to call for restraint, saying in a
   statement, ‚ÄúThe escalation of violence in Rakhine state must stop
   immediately. The EU deplores the attack by the Arakan Army (AA) on
   several police posts in Rakhine State, and deeply regrets the loss of
   lives. We call for restraint and urge all sides to respect their
   obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians.‚Äù

   The government continues to restrict access to almost all United
   Nations and international relief agencies to the townships affected by
   the recent fighting, where over 5,000 civilians have been displaced in
   the past few weeks. That‚Äôs inhibited a credible, impartial humanitarian
   response as reports of abuses against civilians mount.

   Meanwhile, all the pieces of a political, economic, and humanitarian
   conflict are aligning in a potentially new and dangerous phase to
   Rakhine state‚Äôs protracted misery. With growing community support for
   the Arakan Army‚Äôs struggle, and the almost inevitable dramatic and
   abusive overreaction of the Tatmadaw, war could engulf Myanmar‚Äôs
   Rakhine state for years to come.
