   Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
   (ALMA)Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)Funded by the
   U.S. National Science Foundation and its international partners
   (NRAO/ESO/NAOJ), ALMA is among the most complex and powerful
   astronomical observatories on Earth or in space. The telescope is an
   array of 66 high-precision dish antennas in northern Chile.
   [gallery-images-largeALMAAOSfromabove_large.jpg] See more here have
   made the first-ever observations of a circumplanetary disk, the
   planet-girding belt of dust and gas that astronomers strongly theorize
   controls the formation of planets and gives rise to an entire system of
   moons, like those found around Jupiter.

   This never-before-seen feature was discovered around one of the planets
   in PDS 70, a young star located approximately 370 light-years from
   Earth. Recently, astronomers confirmed the presence of two massive,
   Jupiter-like planets there. This earlier discovery was made with the
   European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), which
   detected the warm glow naturally emitted by hydrogen gas accreting onto
   the planets.

   The new ALMA observations instead image the faint radio waves given off
   by the tiny (about one tenth of a millimeter across) particles of dust
   around the star.

   The ALMA data, combined with the earlier optical and infrared VLT
   observations, provide compelling evidence that a dusty disk capable of
   forming multiple moons surrounds the outermost known planet in the
   system.

   “For the first time, we can conclusively see the telltale signs of a
   circumplanetary disk, which helps to support many of the current
   theories of planet formation,” said Andrea Isella, an astronomer at
   Rice University in Houston, Texas, and lead author on a paper published
   in the Astrophysical Journal, Letters.

   “By comparing our observations to the high-resolution infrared and
   optical images, we can clearly see that an otherwise enigmatic
   concentration of tiny dust particles is actually a planet-girding disk
   of dust, the first such feature ever conclusively observed,” he said.
   According to the researchers, this also is the first time that a planet
   has been clearly seen in these three distinct bands of light.

   Unlike the icy rings of Saturn, which likely formed by the crashing
   together of comets and rocky bodies relatively recently in the history
   of our solar system, a circumplanetary disk is the lingering remains of
   the planet-formation process.

   The ALMA data also revealed two distinct differences between the two
   newly discovered planets. The closer in of the two, PDS 70 b, which is
   about the same distance from its star as Uranus is from the Sun, has a
   trailing mass of dust behind it resembling a tail. “What this is and
   what it means for this planetary system is not yet known,” said Isella.
   “The only conclusive thing we can say is that it is far enough from the
   planet to be an independent feature.”

   The second planet, PDS 70 c, resides in the exact same location as a
   clear knot of dust seen in the ALMA data. Since this planet is shining
   so brightly in the infrared and hydrogen bands of light, the
   astronomers can convincingly say that a fully formed planet is already
   in orbit there and that nearby gas continues to be syphoned onto the
   planet’s surface, finishing its adolescent growth spurt.

   This outer planet is located approximately 5.3 billion kilometers from
   the host star, about the same distance as Neptune from our Sun.
   Astronomers estimate that this planet is approximately 1 to 10 times
   the mass of Jupiter. “If the planet is on the larger end of that
   estimate, it’s quite possible there might be planet-size moons in
   formation around it,” noted Isella.

   The ALMA data also add one more important element to these
   observations.

   Optical studies of planetary systems are notoriously challenging. Since
   the star is so much brighter than the planets, it is difficult to
   filter out the glare, much like trying to spot a firefly next to a
   search light. ALMA observations, however, don’t have that limitation
   since stars emit comparatively little light at millimeter and
   submillimeter wavelengths.

   “This means we’ll be able to come back to this system at different time
   periods and more easily map the orbit of the planets and the
   concentration of dust in the system,” concluded Isella. “This will give
   us unique insights into the orbital properties of solar systems in
   their very earliest stages of development.”

   an unusually pronounced warp in both its stellar and gaseous disks. The
   neutral Hydrogen gas, represented in blue, is overlaid on an optical
   image of the stars of the galaxy. Unlike in normal spiral galaxies, the
   brightest concentration of neutral Hydrogen is not found near the
   center of UGC 3697 but along its western edge, where the Very Large
   Array (VLA) has detected a bright, extended region of emission. In
   addition, plumes of gas extend to considerable height above and below
   the disk of the galaxy.

   The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
   Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
   Universities, Inc.
   [logoNRAO.png] Founded in 1956, the NRAO provides state-of-the-art
   radio telescope facilities for use by the international scientific
   community. NRAO telescopes are open to all astronomers regardless of
   institutional or national affiliation. Observing time on NRAO
   telescopes is available on a competitive basis to qualified scientists
   after evaluation of research proposals on the basis of scientific
   merit, the capability of the instruments to do the work, and the
   availability of the telescope during the requested time. NRAO also
   provides both formal and informal programs in education and public
   outreach for teachers, students, the general public, and the media.
   [logoNSF.gif] The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent
   federal agency created by Congress in 1950 "to promote the progess of
   science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to
   secure the national defense..."
   [logoAUI.png] AUI collaborates with the scientific community and
   research sponsors to plan, build, and operate cutting-edge facilities.
   We cultivate excellence, deliver value, enhance education, and engage
   the public.
