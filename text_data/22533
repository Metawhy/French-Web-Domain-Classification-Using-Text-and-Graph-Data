Millennials coming of age

   One of the largest generations in history is about to move into its
   prime spending years. Millennials are poised to reshape the economy;
   their unique experiences will change the ways we buy and sell, forcing
   companies to examine how they do business for decades to come.

   Who Are They?

Who are they?

   A different world, a different worldview. Millennials have grown up in
   a time of rapid change, giving them a set of priorities and
   expectations sharply different from previous generations.

Housing

   As Millennials enter their peak home-buying years, their reluctance to
   enter the housing market could change. The cohort’s sheer size, plus
   its desire to settle down in the future, could lead to a surge in home
   sales.

   Access, not ownership

Access, not ownership

   It’s not just homes: Millennials have been reluctant to buy items such
   as cars, music and luxury goods. Instead, they’re turning to a new set
   of services that provide access to products without the burdens of
   ownership, giving rise to what's being called a "sharing economy."

     “25 years from now, car sharing will be the norm, and car ownership
     an anomaly.”

Wellness

   For Millennials, wellness is a daily, active pursuit. They’re
   exercising more, eating smarter and smoking less than previous
   generations. They’re using apps to track training data, and online
   information to find the healthiest foods. And this is one space where
   they’re willing to spend money on compelling brands.

The Takeaway

   The Millennial generation is the largest in US history and as they
   reach their prime working and spending years, their impact on the
   economy is going to be huge.

   Millennials have come of age during a time of technological change,
   globalization and economic disruption. That’s given them a different
   set of behaviors and experiences than their parents.

   They have been slower to marry and move out on their own, and have
   shown different attitudes to ownership that have helped spawn what’s
   being called a “sharing economy.”

   They’re also the first generation of digital natives, and their
   affinity for technology helps shape how they shop. They are used to
   instant access to price comparisons, product information and peer
   reviews.

   Finally, they are dedicated to wellness, devoting time and money to
   exercising and eating right. Their active lifestyle influences trends
   in everything from food and drink to fashion.

   These are just some of the trends that will shape the new Millennial
   economy.
