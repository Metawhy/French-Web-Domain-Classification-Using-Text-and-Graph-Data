For Immediate Release

   December 13, 2018
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let me start by congratulating Virgin Galactic on a successful flight
   and return from space for the first time since 2004. We applaud your
   determination and pioneering spirit that delivered today‚Äôs milestone
   flight.

   This year, it seems that we continue to reach new milestones within an
   industry that truly seems to see no earthly bounds. If you‚Äôre looking
   for the next big thing, commercial space is it. Safely growing this
   aerospace sector is a priority of President Trump, Vice President Pence
   and Transportation Secretary Chao who represents us with the
   President‚Äôs National Space Council.

   For us, we want to assure you that the FAA is committed to making sure
   that commercial space is safe. We‚Äôre streamlining regulations to make
   these launches a daily occurrence.  Like the early days of aviation,
   these commercial space flights take grit and innovation‚Äîthe very
   attributes it takes to blaze a trail for generations to follow.

   It‚Äôs that grit and innovation we want to recognize. In 2004, we issued
   the first ever Commercial Astronaut Wings to SpaceShipOne pilots Mike
   Melvill and Brian Binnie. Today, on behalf of FAA Acting Administrator,
   Dan Elwell, I‚Äôd like to announce that with today‚Äôs achievement, Mark
   (Stuckey) and CJ (Sturckow) have earned Astronaut Wings, and we‚Äôd like
   to invite you, Richard, George, Mark (Stuckey), CJ (Sturckow), and the
   SpaceShip2 and WhiteKnight2 teams to Washington, D.C., in the new year
   for Mark and CJ to receive their wings.

   Congratulations once again and we look forward to seeing you all in
   soon to recognize today‚Äôs achievement. Well done.
