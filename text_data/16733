   Are you feeling worked up? Boiling over? Frustrated and needing to
   vent? Take it to the mat and find a healthy way to release and work
   through that anger.
   In this practice you will combine Yin Yoga asanas with affirmations to
   address frustrations. Simply repeat the affirmation a few times
   internally, noticing how it makes you feel. Process the emotions that
   come up, feel in to them, and then let them go.
   I highly recommend having a journal at the ready for the end of this
   practice, to write down anything that comes up.
   Also have 1 block handy.

   1. One-minute Breath - When you are worked up, the breath is your best
   resource for calming down and targeting the parasympathetic nervous
   system. The goal of one-minute breath, is to inhale for 20 seconds,
   retain the breath for 20 seconds, and then exhale for 20 seconds. That
   is quite advanced, and will take some time to work up to, so start with
   10. Find a comfortable seat to start. Drop shoulders away from ears and
   rest your hands on the legs. Inhale fully for 10 seconds, hold for 10,
   then exhale for 10. Repeat this for a few rounds of breath. Afterwards,
   allow normal breath to come back. While seated here, bring to mind that
   which is causing you turmoil.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-04%2Bat%2B1.46.02%2BPM.png]
   2. Butterfly - From a seat, bring the soles together to touch, dropping
   the knees out to the side. Start to tilt forward from the pelvis. Make
   this fold passive, rounding in the spine and releasing down with
   gravity. Support the head with the block or let it dangle. Find the
   version of the shape that works for you, find some stillness, and then
   hold the pose for a few minutes.
   Affirmation: "I release the need to control others."
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-04%2Bat%2B1.52.24%2BPM.png]
   3. Dragonfly - Extend the legs out to the sides in a straddle. Rotate
   towards the right leg, then begin to fold. Allowing the body to open in
   to the fold over time. Again you might place a block underneath the
   forehead or leave it to gravity to open up.
   Affirmation: "I am a calm and loving person."
   Lift up slowly, and shift towards the left leg. Repeat.
   Affirmation: "I allow emotions to flow through me without attachment."
   Slowly rise back up, move to center and fold forward.
   Affirmation: "Anger is energy and I turn that energy into positive
   action."
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-04%2Bat%2B2.01.25%2BPM.png]
   4. Half Happy Baby - Lower down on to the back, with knees bent and
   feet flat on the floor. Hug the right knee in to the chest, opening the
   leg to the right side body. Stay here, or catch hold of the big toe and
   kick the heel up as you guide the knee down. Bring the right elbow
   inside of the right knee to open it further. Keep the shoulders and
   head on the ground. To step this up, extend the left leg out in front
   of you, or drop the left knee out to the side. Keep the body weight
   evenly distributed between the two sides.
   Affirmation: "I am a loving force of good in this world."
   Release and switch sides.
   Affirmation: "I let go of old past hurts with ease."
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-04%2Bat%2B2.07.48%2BPM.png]
   5. Banana - Move the hips to the right. Shift the chest, shoulders and
   head to the left. Possibly clasp opposite elbows. Walk the legs to the
   left, as you extend them out. To increase intensity cross the right
   ankle over the left. The whole body should be facing up, isolating this
   stretch in to the side body.
   Affirmation: "Forgiveness comes naturally to me."
   Ease to the other side.
   Affirmation: "Outside circumstances will not affect my inner peace."
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-04%2Bat%2B2.18.26%2BPM.png]
   6. Savasana - Extend out, taking up some space. Shrug the shoulders
   away from the ears. Close the eyes. Release tension from the forehead,
   the cheeks, the jaw. Imagine sinking in to the floor beneath you.
   Affirmation: "This too shall pass. I welcome change."
   Prefer to be guided through the poses and transitions? Practice along
   with me in the video below.

   Who doesn't love a quick, but still deep, stretch in the morning? We
   all have 10 minutes to spare to ensure you wake up the right way and
   have a great day.
   I won't waste any more time, just roll out your mat. No props needed.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.33.36%2BAM.png]
   1. Side Bends - Start standing at the front of your mat, with the feet
   a bit wider than hip width and in parallel. Reach your hands up
   overhead, clasping the opposite wrists. Inhale to lengthen, then as you
   exhale move in to a side bend to the left. Push in to the right hip.
   Inhale to center, exhale to the other side. Move side to side a few
   more times. Take this in to a full circle. Reaching hands to the left,
   bend the knees, fold all the way down, push in to the feet to come up
   to the right. Do 3 rounds. Then switch directions.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.36.31%2BAM.png]
   2. Forward Fold - Reach the hands up, bend your knees and fold all the
   way down. Let the belly rest on to the thighs. Relax the upper body,
   the head, the neck, and shake gently side to side. Bend the left knee
   deeply, while straightening the right leg. Alternate legs. Paddle the
   feet in this way a few times. Next turn the toes out and heels in, bend
   the knees, and drop the hips down in to a yogi squat. Use the elbows to
   push the knees out. Let the hands rest down to the mat in front of you.
   As you exhale, straighten the legs and fold forward. As you inhale,
   bend the knees back to squat. Do 3 rounds.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.42.47%2BAM.png]
   3. Goddess - Take the feet wide, turning heels in and toes out. Reach
   the arms out to the sides, in star pose. As you exhale, bend the knees
   and drop the hips in to Goddess. Squeeze open the glutes, and squeeze
   the shoulder blades behind you. Rest the left hand to the left thigh,
   and reach the right arm up and over in a big side bend. Repeat on the
   other side. Return to center, and rest both hands on thighs. Drop your
   right shoulder down, and pull the left shoulder back. Switch sides.
   Press in to the feet to straighten the legs and bring the feet in to
   parallel. Inhale to lift and lengthen. Exhale, to fold forward and let
   the hands rest down where comfortable.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.48.01%2BAM.png]
   4. Runner's Lunge - From forward fold, walk the hands to the right
   foot. Point the toes to the right, lifting the left heel off the mat,
   and bending in to the right knee. Melt the pelvis down and forward,
   while lifting the heart. Drop your back knee down to the mat. Stay
   here, or reach your right arm back as you bend in to the left knee,
   pulling the left heel in to the glute. Release, and tuck the back toes
   under and lifting the back knee off the mat. Straighten the front leg,
   as you fold in to a wide pyramid. Then walk the hands back to center,
   in to a wide legged forward fold. Take to the other side.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.52.41%2BAM.png]
   5. Flow - Come to standing at the front of your mat, to take a vinyasa
   flow. Inhale the hands over head, exhale fold forward. Inhale hands to
   the shin for a half lift, exhale to step back to plank. Inhale to lower
   down into cobra back bend, then exhale to lift the hips up and back for
   downward dog. While in down dog, bend one knee and push the opposite
   heel down. Then switch. Paddling the legs out. Afterwards, bring the
   big toes together, and take the knees wide as you bend and lower them
   to the mat. Come on to the tops of the feet, sinking hips back to the
   heels. Let forehead come down to mat, reaching the arms forward in
   child's pose.

   6. Shoulder Opening - Bring the knees together as you lift up to
   kneeling. Open up the arms as you squeeze the shoulder blades behind
   you. Bend the arms in to cactus. Exhale, bringing the forearms
   together. Take a few rounds with your breath. Straighten the spine.
   Wrap the right elbow under, binding your arms once or twice. Push the
   elbows away, dropping the shoulders and tuck chin to chest to let
   forehead rest on arms. Repeat on other side.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-27%2Bat%2B9.59.48%2BAM.png]
   7. Unwind - Come to a comfortable seat, roll your shoulders down. Rest
   the hands on the legs. Notice the effects on the body. What feels
   different? Find something to be proud of, or grateful for.

   you do it?!
   This is a great well-rounded challenge to help you be consistent with

   On those days when you want to fire up your practice on the mat, this
   core based Vinyasa class is great. Roll out your mat and start your
   morning with these 7 poses.
   These asanas focus on your abdominals, as well as glutes, and legs. It
   also starts with some breathwork to get your internal fire flaming.
   Let's get to it!
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-20%2Bat%2B11.46.17%2BAM.png]
   1. Pranayama - Sit comfortably, and lengthen through the spine. Focus
   on your naval and low body as you breathe. Feel the belly expanding as
   you inhale, and draw in as you exhale. Notice your deep abdominals
   working. Interlace your fingers, reaching the knuckles forward to
   prepare for Kundalini breathwork. Take a fast deep inhale as you lift
   your hands up, and then a fast exhale as you drop the hands down.
   Continue with this for one minute. When finished place the hands on
   your knees, find a regular breath rhythm, noticing the effects of this
   breathwork.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-20%2Bat%2B11.51.51%2BAM.png]
   2. Down Dog to Plank - Starting in table top, take a few rounds of
   cat/cow. Then tuck the toes underneath and lift your hips up and back
   to downward dog. Inhale, lifting the heels up and ripple forward into
   plank. As you exhale, press in to the heels to reverse back to downward
   dog. Repeat 5 rounds. Then drop the knees down, with hips stacked over.
   Walk hands forward and melt forehead to mat for Puppy Pose.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-20%2Bat%2B11.55.46%2BAM.png]
   3. Cobra - Slide down on to the belly, with the hands at sides of the
   chest. On your inhale, press in to the finger tips, and lift the chest
   up. Exhale to lower. Do 3 baby cobras. Then stack the palms and rest
   the forehead down. As you inhale, lift the feet from the floor as high
   as you can. Exhale the feet down. Repeat 5 times.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-22%2Bat%2B10.46.07%2BAM.png]
   4. Dancing Warrior - Return to downward dog, kicking your right heel up
   to the sky, bend the knee and open the hip. Take a few breaths then
   straighten the leg and step right foot through between the hands. Spin
   the left toes out to the side and heel down as you bend into the right
   knee. Lift up to Warrior 2, reaching hands front to back. Get in to the
   obliques by Dancing your Warrior. As you inhale, reach the right arm up
   and left fingertips reach to front. As you exhale, reverse arms to
   extend forwards. Repeat this through 4 times. Repeat on the other side.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-22%2Bat%2B10.49.17%2BAM.png]
   5. Balance - Step to the front of your mat. With the hands at the
   heart, lift the left knee up. Balancing on the right leg, as you
   straighten the left leg out in front of you and point the toes. Inhale
   the arms up overhead. As you exhale, sweep the arms down and tap toes
   back. Do 5 rounds. Return the hands to the heart, as you kick the left
   leg back behind you into Warrior 3. Squeezing in to the glutes. Repeat
   on the right side.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-22%2Bat%2B10.58.25%2BAM.png]
   6. High Lunge - From downward dog, kick the right leg up. Exhale,
   stepping the right foot through between the hands. Keep the toes tucked
   under and heel kicking back as you lift the hands up in to high lunge.
   As you inhale extend forward, in to a long diagonal line from
   fingertips to heel. Repeat on other side.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-22%2Bat%2B11.09.45%2BAM.png]
   7. Forearms - Return to downward dog, shifting forward to plank. Lower
   down on to the forearms. Walk your feet in and lift your hips up to
   come in to Dolphin pose. Lift the heels as high as you can go. Then see
   if you can kick your right leg up. Lower the right foot back down. Then
   try it on the left leg. Lower down. Drop the knees down, sink hips to
   the heels and take a few breaths in Child's Pose.
