HELLO

meet karly

   I prefer margaritas and sitting in the shade to piña coladas and
   getting caught in the rain.
   From my childhood home in Southern Minnesota, I embrace the crazy of
   everyday life by creating delicious dishes my family and friends love,
   while experimenting with new flavors and techniques and photographing
   the results.

   I just made this...first time making bacon jam. The only thing I didn't
   do was put it in the blender. I'm going to serve it on top of bbq
   chicken so I wanted it chunky! That is...if it makes it to dinner...I
   could eat it straight out of the pan! Yummy!

   Bacon fat bombs and my ketogenic journey are so very thankful right
   now. Perfect for snacking or for a fast breakfast instead of the keto
   fat coffee. Yum!
