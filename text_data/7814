Binding Clip Bag Tutorial

   Jun20

   IMG_2250

   I seriously love binding clips and use them all the time. I didn’t love
   the plastic box they came in. The box opened awkwardly, and I was
   constantly spilling the clips all over the floor.  I finally had it one
   day and decided to come up with a better container option.

   This little container is way cuter, and the medium thick interfacing
   allows it to stand nice and stiff.  The round shape helps it roll with
   the wild, hands flying, circus that sewing can sometimes be – without
   any spilling! Kind of like an adorable weeble-wobble (remember those?)

   IMG_2251

   I’m sharing a very basic tutorial today, meaning you’re  going to have
   to draw your pattern pieces, and use your creativity!

   1. Make your pattern shapes.

   IMG_2211

   You’ll need a hexagon with sides measuring      1 3/8 “.  And your side
   piece measuring 4 3/4″ tall, and ends measuring 1 7/8″ wide. To
   accomplish this side shape- cut a piece of scrap paper 5″ x 4 3/4″ –
   fold in half, open and draw    1 7/8″ lines in the center on the 4 3/4”
   ends  then draw a curved line meeting at your lines. Fold in half and
   cut out your shape.

   IMG_2212

   IMG_2213

   2. Cut your fabrics.

   IMG_2214

   You’ll need 6 outer fabric pieces, 6 lining fabric pieces, and 6
   fusible interfacing (medium thickness) pieces.   1 each of outer,
   lining, and interfacing of the hexagon shape.

   3. Iron your fusible interfacing to the outer fabric pieces.

   IMG_2215

   4. Sewing pieces together.

   We need to leave the ends of the side panels unsewn 1/4″ on one end to
   give us a seam allowance to sew in the hexagon piece to make a bottom.
   If using directional fabric make sure to leave the bottom open 1/4″.

   Mark the 1/4″ seam allowances 1/4″ from the bottom with an erasable
   marker (I used frixon heat erasable marker.) Then begin to sew panels
   together, stopping and back stitching at your marks.

   IMG_2216

   Continue sewing panels until they are all joined, and you have a ball
   shape.

   IMG_2217

   Repeat with the lining pieces.

   5. Adding the hexagon bottom.

   There are two ways to go about attaching your hexagon to the bottom.
   1. If you’re an awesome seamstress you can pin and sew with your
   machine using 1/4″ seam.  I tried this and it was hard for me!   2.
   This method worked best for me – draw your quarter inch seam lines all
   around your hexagon, pin in place, and hand sew on the line.

   IMG_2221

   IMG_2222

   6. Finishing

   Place the lining inside the outer bag, wrong sides together. Hand baste
   around the top, using a 1/8″ seam, stop when you have basted three
   panels, but don’t cut the thread.

   IMG_2224

   You are going to draw a half moon shape using an erasable marker. I
   just eyed this until I liked how it looked.  Then cut away the fabric
   on the line, and continue basting the rest of the way around.

   IMG_2226

   IMG_2227

   Add your binding, and any embellishments you like, fill with cute
   things, and enjoy!

Farmhouse Tables

   Oct11

   fall table I’ve been enjoying my farmhouse table my Dad made me for
   many years. It’s held up to 2 kids, many homework sessions, countless
   meals, craft sessions, nail paintings, holidays, and good times.

   Dad asked me if I would post a pic of his tables here just in case
   anyone in the Michigan area would like a farmhouse table of their own.
   He is retired now and loves being in his workshop. He has two tables
   ready, they can be stained any color. They measure 32″ x 72″ (or 3 by 6
   feet.) If you are interested let me know!

Embroidery Floss Folder Tutorial

   Jul27

   c and b floss folder 042

   Hi friends! I know it’s been a bit since last we spoke, and I really
   need to catch up with you all. I hope your summer is going well!

   I’ve been doodling around with hand embroidery quite a bit these last
   few weeks as I find it’s very easy to do in the car, or at the beach
   while watching the kiddos.

   I kept dragging around my projects and floss in a draw string bag that
   kept getting all tangled up.  The solution? An Embroidery Floss Folder!
   Yeppa!

   c and b floss folder 045

   Here’s a quick and dirty tutorial if you need to make one too!

   Supplies:

   *10 x 14.5 inch  of one each-

   Exterior, Lining, Medium weight fusible interfacing, Soft N Stable

   *Package of binding for pockets (or make your own)

   *2 strips x WOF for binding exterior

   4- 2 x 14 .5 inch strips of vinyl  ( I think mine was 16 gauge ?)

   A hera marker, non-stick presser foot, binding clips

   c and b floss folder 006

   Step One

   Iron your medium weight interfacing onto the back of your lining
   fabric. Set aside

   Step Two

   Cut your pocket binding strips into 15 inch strips.

   c and b floss folder 007 Using binding clips to help hold the binding
   on your vinyl pocket pieces, top stitch the binding onto all four.

   c and b floss folder 011

   Step 3

   Use a ruler to measure 1 1/2 inches down from the top of your lining
   piece.  Line your first pocket up with this and use binding clips to
   hold as you stitch close to the bottom edge. If you have a non-stick
   presser foot for your machine it may help to use it for this step.

   c and b floss folder 015

   Continue lining the top of your pocket pieces up with the last stitched
   line and stitch close to the bottom of the vinyl.

   c and b floss folder 021

   The last pocket piece should leave about 1/2 inch of lining uncovered.

   c and b floss folder 025

   Step 4

   Using a water or heat soluble fabric marker and your ruler-mark lines
   at the top and bottom (picture shows only marks at the top, but do the
   bottom too!) at the 2 5/8, 4 3/4, 7 1/4, 9 3/4, and 11 7/8 inch marks.

   c and b floss folder 028

   Line your ruler up at the center marks first and press the line with a
   hera marker.

   c and b floss folder 026

   Machine stitch on the line you pressed with the hera marker.

   Repeat this process with the other marks you measured -moving out from
   the center.

   Congrats you just made your pockets!

   Step 5

   Embellishing-  you may chose to patchwork, embroider, or add applique
   to your exterior.  I added a little bit of this and that to my
   exterior.

   Step 6

   Layering-

   Lay your lining/pockets face down, lay the soft n stable on top, then
   the exterior face up.

   You may chose to add a snap or magnetic closure at this time.

   If not then just use binding clips to keeps your layers together.

   Use your walking foot to baste the layers together stitching with a 1/8
   seam allowance around the entire outside.

   c and b floss folder 038

   Step 7

   Bind your project like you would a quilt.

     c and b floss folder 040

    AND ENJOY!

   Later gators,

New Tote and some head scratchers

   Apr13

   IMG_3162

   I cut into my Maker fabric this weekend to make this really fun bag.
   The pattern is the 241 Tote by Noodlehead.  You can buy it here.

   Usually I’m pretty good at figuring out how to make stuff without a
   pattern, but I kept staring at all the awesome pictures of this bag on
   the net and thinking, “how in the world does that go together?” It was
   driving me crazy trying to figure it out in my head, so I finally just
   bought it. I am glad I did! What a nice pattern. I’m sure I’ll make
   many more.

   IMG_3161

   I changed it up a little by piecing the main bag panel and I added
   grommets and a leather handle with swivel clips.  I scored a really
   nice bag of leather scraps at the craft store for 7 bucks (and I had a
   40 percent off coupon which made it even cheaper!)  So now I have lots
   and lots of leather for purse straps. Cool!

   side story:  while I was hammering in the grommets I kept thinking,
   don’t hammer your thumb Melissa!! don’t hammer your thumb!!! I totally
   hammered my thumb.  It was all swollen and throbbing like a Fred
   Flintstone cartoon.

   Speaking of head scratchers,  a few other things have had me thinking
   hmmmm? lately too.

   One is this pillow. m_T2YoJAg9dORJ-LbrkDjGg I love it. I keep seeing it
   in Home decorating pictures. It’s totally an album block right? We can
   make a quilty one! But for some reason my brain took forever to figure
   it out because all the album blocks I’ve ever made are just one row of
   “steps.”  Then I thought maybe you make in like an Irish chain? no
   Maybe like a trip around the world? no  You have to make the album
   block but instead of making the block you make the whole thing at once
   laying out all the pieces and sewing long rows.  Right? Or is there an
   easier way? Maybe I’ve confused you as much as myself. LOL!!!!! =)

   Two is my house.

   house pic

   We’re having it scraped and painted the 3rd week of May. You would
   think it would be fun to pick out new house colors….but it’s a
   nightmare. We have to live with it for 10 years, what if it’s ugly???
   Part of the reason is we have to keep the trim dark and the body light
   or it would cost 30 % more. We both hate the red, but can’t figure out
   a good color scheme. We’re spending a small fortune on sample pots to
   try out and none of them have worked. I thought we nailed it this
   weekend with a light gray body, dark gray outer trim and a darker,
   browner red inner trim.  And here is the crazy man I live with….it
   reminded him of Ohio State colors and he wont have people saying that
   to him.   Who would see a house and think of sports? UGGG, men. Any
   suggestions? (about the house, not the man. hehehe)

   Hope you have a great week!

   Melissa

   p.s. I’ve been using Instagram a lot lately. I’d love it if you want to
   add me and I’ll add you back!  I’m: lussier1971

Farmhouse Glam

   Mar21

   c and b 002

   I think I freaked some people out with my last decorating post.
   Especially my husband and my Mom.  I hope you lovely readers aren’t too
   put off by the direction my tastes are moving, and that you continue to
   see something here in my posts, whether  it be quilting or decorating,
   that  interests you.  And if not we can still be friends!  Just think
   of it as if your friend got a really bad haircut: you still stay
   friends, say nice things, and wait for it to grow out! LOL

   I can only explain it as I’ve had the some of the same furniture and
   decor for 12 years or more, and quite frankly I just get sick of
   looking at it after all that time.  I explained it to my husband as:
   you wouldn’t want the same stuff in the year 2000 as you would in 1988
   right?  I think he is mostly concerned about me spending a ton of cash
   on new things.

   Change doesn’t have to mean buying all new things, sometimes you can
   just add a little paint!

   I got a change bug this week and incorporated some of the design
   elements I was talking about last time in this little nook under the
   stairs.

   cornbread and beans quilting blog 001

   I cut a template out of  cereal box cardboard and traced it on the wall
   with chalk. I used chalk paint to trace the lines.

   wall

   Then I *GASP* painted the sideboard with the same chalk paint. I still
   need to wax and distress it.  It’s looking a little starkly white at
   the moment.  Added a pretty mirror and some new lamps.

   Viola! Something new to look at!

   c and b 006

   I can add the quilt shelf back when I get sick of looking at it like
   this, but for now it’s feeling fresh, uncluttered,  and spring like

   c and b

   Enjoy the weekend!
