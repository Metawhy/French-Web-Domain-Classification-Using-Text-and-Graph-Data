   WELCOME TO PROMPTUARIUM!

   my little stockroom of goodies.

   For decades I have been hoarding prompts, story starters, quotes and
   seeds from various sources around the world  (and my own, of course).
   You will find them all here on this site, I have tried to break them
   down into categories to make things a little easier.

   SO PLEASE ENJOY 😀

   Also: If you’re impatient (like me 🙂 ) You can find all the prompts I
   have here PLUS a whole lot more on my pinterest, where I have quite a
   few other folders that have writing tools, reference material, world
   building, maps and floorplans, and oodles of pictures relating to
   weapons, fashions, transport, gadgets and the like.

   So what are you waiting for? Follow the pinterest link to find my
   treasure trove of writers goodies!

   Feel free to comment under any of the prompts on this site (I’d love to
   hear what you think) and DON’T FORGET to FOLLOW ME and TELL YOUR
   FRIENDS about PROMPTUARIUM!!

   Thankyou x

       Neat idea! We really like the horror writing prompts (horror is my
       genre of choice). We’re new to Word Press as well (still trying to
       figure out how everything works). If you would like to check it
       out, we just put our on going multimedia horror story up on Word
       Press. It started out as a multimedia horror story told through
       Facebook posts, but we decided to expand it to Word Press as well.
       You can find it clicking on the following link:
       http://towerofteeth.com/
       Again, great idea for a Word Press page, can’t wait to work on some
       of those prompts!

            Wow, Thanks!
            I’ve been really worried about spamming everyone with all my
            posts so I’m glad the first comment I received is a positive
            one! 🙂
            I love horror! Your homepage pic is awesome btw!
            Glad you like the prompts!
            Thanks again!

       First off, THANK YOU! Secondly, you’re AMAZING and a lifesaver!
       I’ve been searching the internet for good writing prompts to get me
       started, only to come up short… And then, I stumbled on your blog.
       This is absolutely fantastic, and I’m not being sarcastic. Your
       prompts are so, so, SO helpful! I’ve got so many ideas and so many
       stories are suddenly demanding to be told. I cannot wait to get
       started on some of these. Thank you once again!

       Hello! My name is Alyssa and I run the Tumblr page Unblocking
       Writer’s Block, where I post creative writing prompts. I
       accidentally stumbled across this page via Pinterest when I saw one
       of my prompts posted there. I then found lots of my prompts posted
       here. I LOVE the fact that you love them enough to post them here,
       but I don’t see any sources on them. I would really appreciate the
       fact that, if you’re going to quote the prompts word for word, then
       at least post the source. I’m not trying to be rude, but I was very
       surprised to see my prompts copied here. I also can’t contact you
       any other way, so I’m sorry for the message like this, but I do
       feel I need to say something.
       Thank you for your time.

            hi alyssa,
            I collect a lot of my prompts from many sources and as a
            result i do see them repeated on various sites and am unsure
            of the original sources, if i know of the source, i usually
            write it above the prompt, for the ones i’m unsure about i try
            to cover by stating on the homepage that they are from various
            places, (so people know i don’t want to claim them as my own).
            if you point me in the direction of your prompts then i’m
            happy to add a link to them xx

       Hi, Joanne.
       What is your policy regarding allowing others to use the prompts
       you’ve posted here (and on Pinterest, which is how I found my way
       to your blog) in their own blog posts? Are you okay with that as
       long as they provide a link to THIS blog? Or do you prefer that
       these not be shared/used anywhere else?
       (I sometimes have blog posts about various aspects of writing — the
       mechanics as well as the more creative stuff — and I have
       frequently thought some of the prompts you shared on Pinterest
       would be useful examples of what I’m blogging about.)

       Anyone is free to use the prompts that are posted here however they
       want, If you want to share them then that’s great! a link is always

            Love your prompts! I have started a writing blog called
            BoostYourWriting.com to help high school students improve
            their writing. I would love to feature some of the prompts
            from my Pinterest board a couple of times a month. Not
            surprisingly, most of them are from you 🙂 I think, from the
            comment above, that this might be OK. Since this would be on a
            regular basis, though, I wanted to check with you. Thanks for
            letting me know!

       Hi! I absolutely love this website and often use your prompts for
       my writers blog (http://promptstoriesblog.wordpress.com) and I had
       a prompt for you! Here it is:
       “Don’t touch me!” She yelled, standing up. “I just saved your
       life!” He responded. “Well, maybe you should have saved my brother
       instead!” She shouted, backing away from him as tears filled her
       eyes. “I tried, okay?” He told her. She was livid, tears falling
       down her face. “No, you didn’t! Just because you don’t have a
       family, doesn’t mean you can’t show sympathy for mine!”
       There you go. It could be either a writing or dialogue prompt. You
       choose. Thanks for running this blog!

       Hi, I just found you and your blog through Pinterest, and boy and I
       glad I found you. It’s hard to find some decent writing prompts and
       I like the fact you have varied sections in which to inspire.
       I will definitely be back.
       Feel free to check out my blog I am just getting back into again.

       Hi! My name is Alaina and I have the same concerns as Alyssa. I am
       glad to see it resolved and was wondering if there is any way I can
       be credited for my prompts. If I were to direct you to my Pinterest
       profile where my prompts are posted, would that provide enough
       source to credit me for it? I am ThatWriterFreak on Pinterest and
       your post “Are We Monsters?” is uploaded onto both boards “Myth”
       and “Written Writing Prompts.” I use my prompts as a way to bring
       attention to my work and it would be great if I was credited on all
       posts including them. Thanks for your time, and for the amazing
       website!

       Hello!
       I have a question regarding the rights to use your prompts for
       short films. I’m a filmmaker and I stumbled upon your prompts, in
       particular, your Human Summoning writing prompt and I would love to
       use it for a short film. I’ve already got ideas on how to expand on
       it as a comedy! Would you be willing to let me use it or would you
       prefer that I, instead of copying it and expand upon it, create a
       different story with similar aspects?
       Thanks for posting these prompts! I just stumbled on your website
       and I look at this as a valuable resource for future stories/films.

                 I’ll make sure to send it to you when it’s finished. Is
                 there an email you have that I can send a release form
                 to? This is just a short document detailing that you’ve
                 given me permission to use your writing prompt for the
                 short film.

       Thank you for your time in writing! Your found/original prompts are
       helpful–and even when I don’t use them, I read them just to smile 🙂

            Aww thanks, much appreciated! im glad theyre useful, i never
            seem to get round to writing stories and poems anymore so i
            thought id just build up prompts for when i do, and then
            decided it would be great to share them all, i love to see the
            stories that people write! xx
