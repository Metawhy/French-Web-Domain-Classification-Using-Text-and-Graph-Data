   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI

   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   MESSI

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   in day out, then we won’t make it.

   RAPINOE

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

Klopp: I am who I am because of my players

   25 Sep 2019

   Jurgen Klopp was struggling to contain his emotions. Just a few moments
   earlier, the Liverpool coach had put the icing on his spectacular 2019
   with The Best FIFA Men’s Coach Award and the smile from his face showed
   his immense pride. For the German coach, emotions and analysis have
   always gone hand in hand, and in that expansive mood he spoke to
   FIFA.com in detail about his amazing year.

FIFA.com: How do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Men's Coach of
2019?

   Jurgen Klopp: I didn’t expect to feel so good, but I’m really happy to
   be here and really proud to have won this award. It’s a great day for
   me.

You said before you preferred team rather than individual recognition, in
that sense, do you share this award with your players?

   Of course, absolutely. In terms of football, I am who I am because of
   my players but, as a person, I am who I am because of my family, and I
   am very grateful to them as well. They are everything to me.

You had to beat two excellent coaches to be The Best, what do you think of
them?

   I respect them a lot. What [Mauricio] Pochettino did last year was so
   exceptional. Many times when you don’t win a title, people don’t
   remember you but he was extremely impressive. He has built his team
   step by step, keeping the team together. Pep Guardiola… what can I say?
   He has won so many titles, the way his teams play. He’s so exceptional;
   hands down, the best manager I’ve coached against. It was an honour to
   be nominated alongside them.

Three Premier League coaches, does this mark a trend for football in the
coming years?

   Well, I wouldn’t go that far. The Premier League has a big influence
   from different managers. It’s not reflected in the results every time
   because that’d be impossible but, in the long term, we have been
   influential. I don’t think it’s a trend because football always changes
   but there are so many good teams in the Premier League fighting for
   something. It’s not that we have made Spain or Germany smaller, it’s
   that the competition can be of six or seven teams and that makes it
   really special. And those teams obviously have great managers.

What was your favourite moment of 2019?

   The victory against Barcelona. It was the outstanding moment for sure.
   A lot of experts, myself probably included, wouldn’t have bet money on
   us. Because being 3-0 down against a team with [Lionel] Messi, [Luis]
   Suarez and all those players looks like a death sentence. We didn’t
   believe we’d win, we just knew we had a chance, and we believed in that
   chance. It was massive. The support we had in the stadium. Looking back
   we could say we won the Champions League in that game. All of us will
   remember it forever.

What did you tell the players before that match?

   A lot of things, but the key words were at the end. I said. “I normally
   wouldn’t think it’s possible, but because it’s you, we have a chance”.
   That was exactly what I thought and what I felt. And from the first
   minute we were literally all over Barcelona. And at that moment, I
   thought “we are ready at least”, and it’s very difficult to cope with a
   team like us and the atmosphere in the stadium in moments like this.

There’s an anecdote that says that, the day after you won the Bundesliga with
Dortmund, you woke up in the parade bus all alone. Did something similar
happen this time?

   That anecdote is true! It was after the parade. But that morning when I
   woke up and I didn’t really know what had happened, I decided something
   like that would never happen again. I’m a control freak so I don’t like
   to be drunk. This time I was completely sober so I remember every
   second of the parade. I think I’d be able to recognise people in the
   city that I saw from that bus if I see them again. It was that intense,
   just incredible.

     * Ellis: "Being the coach of this team has been a tremendous
       privilege"

   Though it was the second time that she took home FIFA's top prize for
   women's coaches, Jill Ellis was still emotional after hearing the
   ovation at the Teatro alla Scala Monday night.

   “Oh, it is heavy”, the USA head coach said, firmly grasping the trophy
   in her hands.

   Ellis spoke to FIFA.com about her back-to-back FIFA Women's World Cup™
   titles and now having two coaching awards in tow.

FIFA.com: Jill, how do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Women's
Coach?

   Jill Ellis: It is incredible; very special and truly an honour. I am
   blessed to have it. I represent so many other people. Winning this
   award twice it is incredible. Without the players and all the staff you
   don’t achieve these things – it is truly a team award. My players, they
   had an amazing summer. I owe so much to them.

Winning a FIFA Women's World Cup is amazing. Winning two in a row is
historic.

   It was incredibly special. And both of them were very different. I had
   a lot longer build-up for the one in 2019; the one in 2015 was a
   shorter time. Both were very, very special. I think this recent one was
   hard, just because of all the teams we had to fight to win. A lot of
   really talented teams. But I had a great team and a lot of supporters
   with us. It just made the journey incredibly special.

Can you pick out a favourite moment from your time in France?

   A lot of really cool moments. I think the evening at the Parc des
   Princes playing France was unlike any match I've ever been involved in:
   the atmosphere, the stage, playing against the home team, playing such
   a phenomenal opponent that performed so well. That was a memory that
   really stuck out.

   I think that Alyssa Naeher's penalty save [in the semi-final against
   England] was one of those moments, too. With the level of competition,
   you just knew that it would be hard for us to be successful. Sharing
   those moments with our fans and my family, with the players and the
   staff, and actually lifting the trophy was pretty remarkable.

Your run as USA coach will be over soon. What are your emotions nearing the
end?

   It feels gratifying. It was the right decision. It was an amazing
   journey with a fantastic group of players. But it feels right – I'm
   ready to go on and face a different challenge. Being the coach of this
   team has been a tremendous privilege. But I am ready now to try and do
   something different.

It sounds like retirement isn't in your plans just yet.

   I feel that I'm too young to retire. I love the game, so I would love
   to be connected to the game in some way. What that will be, I don’t
   know yet. I haven’t really thought it through. I have two more games,
   and then I will pause and see what happens. Soccer is such a great part
   of my life; I cannot image not staying connected to it.

Do you feel like you're leaving any unfinished business?

   No, I feel that this journey is more than just matches and medals and
   trophies. It is really about moments. And I think that along this
   journey there have been highs and there's most definitely been lows. I
   think that the tough times and the great times are all part of it, and
   I embrace it all. There is nothing that I feel I left undone. The
   journey is what it is, and it has been a great ride.

     This is how Jill Ellis voted 🗳️

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI
   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   RAPINOE

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

Klopp: I am who I am because of my players

   25 Sep 2019

   Jurgen Klopp was struggling to contain his emotions. Just a few moments
   earlier, the Liverpool coach had put the icing on his spectacular 2019
   with The Best FIFA Men’s Coach Award and the smile from his face showed
   his immense pride. For the German coach, emotions and analysis have
   always gone hand in hand, and in that expansive mood he spoke to
   FIFA.com in detail about his amazing year.

FIFA.com: How do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Men's Coach of
2019?

   Jurgen Klopp: I didn’t expect to feel so good, but I’m really happy to
   be here and really proud to have won this award. It’s a great day for
   me.

You said before you preferred team rather than individual recognition, in
that sense, do you share this award with your players?

   Of course, absolutely. In terms of football, I am who I am because of
   my players but, as a person, I am who I am because of my family, and I
   am very grateful to them as well. They are everything to me.

You had to beat two excellent coaches to be The Best, what do you think of
them?

   I respect them a lot. What [Mauricio] Pochettino did last year was so
   exceptional. Many times when you don’t win a title, people don’t
   remember you but he was extremely impressive. He has built his team
   step by step, keeping the team together. Pep Guardiola… what can I say?
   He has won so many titles, the way his teams play. He’s so exceptional;
   hands down, the best manager I’ve coached against. It was an honour to
   be nominated alongside them.

Three Premier League coaches, does this mark a trend for football in the
coming years?

   Well, I wouldn’t go that far. The Premier League has a big influence
   from different managers. It’s not reflected in the results every time
   because that’d be impossible but, in the long term, we have been
   influential. I don’t think it’s a trend because football always changes
   but there are so many good teams in the Premier League fighting for
   something. It’s not that we have made Spain or Germany smaller, it’s
   that the competition can be of six or seven teams and that makes it
   really special. And those teams obviously have great managers.

What was your favourite moment of 2019?

   The victory against Barcelona. It was the outstanding moment for sure.
   A lot of experts, myself probably included, wouldn’t have bet money on
   us. Because being 3-0 down against a team with [Lionel] Messi, [Luis]
   Suarez and all those players looks like a death sentence. We didn’t
   believe we’d win, we just knew we had a chance, and we believed in that
   chance. It was massive. The support we had in the stadium. Looking back
   we could say we won the Champions League in that game. All of us will
   remember it forever.

What did you tell the players before that match?

   A lot of things, but the key words were at the end. I said. “I normally
   wouldn’t think it’s possible, but because it’s you, we have a chance”.
   That was exactly what I thought and what I felt. And from the first
   minute we were literally all over Barcelona. And at that moment, I
   thought “we are ready at least”, and it’s very difficult to cope with a
   team like us and the atmosphere in the stadium in moments like this.

There’s an anecdote that says that, the day after you won the Bundesliga with
Dortmund, you woke up in the parade bus all alone. Did something similar
happen this time?

   That anecdote is true! It was after the parade. But that morning when I
   woke up and I didn’t really know what had happened, I decided something
   like that would never happen again. I’m a control freak so I don’t like
   to be drunk. This time I was completely sober so I remember every
   second of the parade. I think I’d be able to recognise people in the
   city that I saw from that bus if I see them again. It was that intense,
   just incredible.

     * Ellis: "Being the coach of this team has been a tremendous
       privilege"

   Though it was the second time that she took home FIFA's top prize for
   women's coaches, Jill Ellis was still emotional after hearing the
   ovation at the Teatro alla Scala Monday night.

   “Oh, it is heavy”, the USA head coach said, firmly grasping the trophy
   in her hands.

   Ellis spoke to FIFA.com about her back-to-back FIFA Women's World Cup™
   titles and now having two coaching awards in tow.

FIFA.com: Jill, how do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Women's
Coach?

   Jill Ellis: It is incredible; very special and truly an honour. I am
   blessed to have it. I represent so many other people. Winning this
   award twice it is incredible. Without the players and all the staff you
   don’t achieve these things – it is truly a team award. My players, they
   had an amazing summer. I owe so much to them.

Winning a FIFA Women's World Cup is amazing. Winning two in a row is
historic.

   It was incredibly special. And both of them were very different. I had
   a lot longer build-up for the one in 2019; the one in 2015 was a
   shorter time. Both were very, very special. I think this recent one was
   hard, just because of all the teams we had to fight to win. A lot of
   really talented teams. But I had a great team and a lot of supporters
   with us. It just made the journey incredibly special.

Can you pick out a favourite moment from your time in France?

   A lot of really cool moments. I think the evening at the Parc des
   Princes playing France was unlike any match I've ever been involved in:
   the atmosphere, the stage, playing against the home team, playing such
   a phenomenal opponent that performed so well. That was a memory that
   really stuck out.

   I think that Alyssa Naeher's penalty save [in the semi-final against
   England] was one of those moments, too. With the level of competition,
   you just knew that it would be hard for us to be successful. Sharing
   those moments with our fans and my family, with the players and the
   staff, and actually lifting the trophy was pretty remarkable.

Your run as USA coach will be over soon. What are your emotions nearing the
end?

   It feels gratifying. It was the right decision. It was an amazing
   journey with a fantastic group of players. But it feels right – I'm
   ready to go on and face a different challenge. Being the coach of this
   team has been a tremendous privilege. But I am ready now to try and do
   something different.

It sounds like retirement isn't in your plans just yet.

   I feel that I'm too young to retire. I love the game, so I would love
   to be connected to the game in some way. What that will be, I don’t
   know yet. I haven’t really thought it through. I have two more games,
   and then I will pause and see what happens. Soccer is such a great part
   of my life; I cannot image not staying connected to it.

Do you feel like you're leaving any unfinished business?

   No, I feel that this journey is more than just matches and medals and
   trophies. It is really about moments. And I think that along this
   journey there have been highs and there's most definitely been lows. I
   think that the tough times and the great times are all part of it, and
   I embrace it all. There is nothing that I feel I left undone. The
   journey is what it is, and it has been a great ride.

     * Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019
     * The USA star claimed the award after a stellar France 2019
     * Rapinoe: "There were some incredible moments"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in July.
   FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her trophy
   on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   FIFA.com: How does it feel to hold The Best FIFA Women’s Player award
   in your hand? Megan Rapinoe: It’s extremely heavy! To hold it in my
   hands is a dream come true, it’s very exciting. Credit to everyone else
   in my life, I wouldn’t be here without all of them. It’s quite surreal
   to be honest, I’ve never been to [The Best FIFA Football Awards], and
   I’m quite old for it to be my first one!

   You made a pretty powerful acceptance speech, how did it feel to have
   that stage to speak to the world?
   In a room full of such influential and powerful people and people that
   have the ability to change the world, it felt like it was the right
   time and the right opportunity to say what I had to say.

     Megan Rapinoe: The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019 acceptance speech

     An empassioned speech from 🇺🇸 Megan Rapinoe 😍 Having had an amazing
     2019, where she won her second FIFA Women's World Cup title, the
     U.S. Soccer star was crowned as #TheBest FIFA Women's Player. 🏆🏆
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Monday, 23 September 2019

   It’s been a really good year of football. Who did you enjoy watching
   playing, on both sides: men and women?
   I mean, we had the Women’s World Cup – the whole thing was amazing.
   There were some incredible moments. Thailand scoring their first goal,
   I thought Norway were great. We did... alright! Playing in France, in
   Paris at the Parc des Princes was incredible. I don’t know if I can
   pick out one player. Maybe Sam Kerr, she’s tearing it up. She’s just a
   goal a game, every game.

   On the men’s side… I think my favourite player right now is Kevin de
   Bruyne. He’s kind of low key but he is just incredible. He pulls all
   the strings in that midfield for City.

   At France 2019, you won the adidas Golden Ball and adidas Golden Boot –
   have we seen the very best of you?
   I never really want to put a limit on myself, but I think we’re
   probably pretty close to the top right now! The last couple of years
   have definitely been the top, but I think to put it all together into
   the most important tournament for us and to be able to bring the trophy
   home for our country again, that’s got to be a high for me.

   What were the differences between the journey in 2015 and in 2019?
   They were vastly different. Even now I was only a few years older, it
   felt like I was way older. I had such an incredible group of veterans
   that were with me almost my whole career. Having to take that much more
   of a leadership role, becoming almost instantly one of the oldest
   players on the whole team after all of them retired… just a whole lot
   more responsibility and you just have to think about a lot more. With
   that there’s a different sense of pride almost in that you’re taking
   care of the team and doing all these other things and then you see the
   team succeed and then you’re proud of your team in a different way.

   Jill Ellis only has a couple of games left as the USWNT coach. If you
   had to say thanks to Jill for something, what would it be?
   I think Jill put us all in a position to be the best players we can be.
   I think it showed on the field that we had incredible chemistry as a
   team and we knew exactly the way that we were going to win. That was a
   lot different from 2015 where I felt like the whole tournament we were
   kind of figuring out exactly what we were going to do, this time it
   felt like we just kind of looked in each other’s eyes and knew exactly
   the way that we wanted to play, and that was a huge credit to Jill and
   the coaching staff.

Messi: It's the team that counts

     * Lionel Messi crowned The Best FIFA Men’s Player in Milan
     * Beat fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to the
       award
     * Messi speaks to FIFA about the season past and his future with club
       and country

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest on Monday evening. Lionel
   Messi collected The Best FIFA Men’s Player award for the first time,
   though it is the sixth time that he has been recognised by world
   football’s governing body as the player of the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

You’ve won a lot of awards but this is your first The Best. How do you feel?

   I’m very happy to receive this award. Like I always say, though,
   individual awards are secondary to me because it’s the team that
   counts. It’s a special night because I’m lucky enough to have my wife
   here and two of my three children as well. To be able to enjoy this
   moment with them is unique.

     Lionel Messi: The Best

     He's been the best there is plenty of times before, but it remained
     a special night for Leo Messi. 🏆🇦🇷 Here's what it's like being
     crowned The Best FIFA Men's Player 👑
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Tuesday, 24 September 2019

This award aside, how would you sum up the season you’ve just had?

   It was strange. We were having a fantastic season as a team and then
   one match changed it all (Barcelona’s defeat to Liverpool in the second
   leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final). It was such a massive
   disappointment that we just didn’t attach any importance to the League
   and we didn’t prepare properly for the Copa del Rey final. That’s how
   big a blow it was for us. That one game left its mark on a season that
   had been perfect up to then. We were so close to making another
   Champions League final, but it ended up being a painful campaign for
   us.

At the recent UEFA awards, you were seen chatting very amicably with
Cristiano Ronaldo. Why do you think people are surprised when they see both
of you getting along together?

   Because of the big sporting rivalry that’s developed between us over
   the last few years, because one us played for Barcelona and the other
   for [Real] Madrid, and because we won individual awards. People perhaps
   think the rivalry goes beyond football, but it doesn’t. We both want
   what’s best for our teams and neither of us like losing. It’s something
   we don’t accept. That’s why there’s that competitiveness between us.
   The important thing is that it stays there, out on the pitch.

We’ve seen some new faces at Barcelona at the start of the season, such as
Ansu Fati. What do you make of the expectation he’s generating?

   I really like him and I try to help and support him. He’s an amazing
   player and he’s got what it takes to succeed. But if I look at it
   through my eyes, I’d like them to bring him on gradually, like they did
   with me when I started, taking things nice and easy and without putting
   pressure on him. You have to remember that he’s only 16. I hope he
   keeps on enjoying it and that all the fuss around him doesn’t have a
   negative impact on him because he has the quality to become one of the
   best.

So now you can understand how Ronaldinho treated you when you started out.

   Ronaldinho and [Frank] Rijkaard too, who was the coach back then. In
   fact, I’d say the whole team. Everyone helped me in one way or another,
   especially the coach when he left me out and I used to get annoyed
   (smiles). Now that I’m older I’ve come to understand that was the best
   thing for me and I’ll always be grateful to him for that. I’ve told him
   that too. The way he handled me was really important.

The Argentinian national team are undergoing a major transformation too. Have
any of your team-mates surprised you in particular?

   I wouldn’t say they’ve surprised me because I knew them already and I
   know what they’re capable of. I see them with their clubs and I knew
   about the new breed coming through. Where they have surprised me,
   though, is as people. There were a lot of them that I didn’t know
   personally, and it was a lovely surprise to be able to share a Copa
   America with them and see that aside from being great players they’re
   very normal and down-to-earth people too.

Lionel Scaloni has just been given the Argentina job on a permanent basis.
How would you describe him?

   He’s a coach who has things clear in his head, who knows how to watch
   football and is very good at getting things across. He’s easy to
   understand, he’s good at his job and he knows how to handle the
   players. I think they got it right in giving him the job permanently
   and the space and time he needs to work with the national team.

Talking of Scaloni and looking at Pablo Aimar, do you see yourself as a coach
one day?

   I’ve always said that I don’t, but you never know. I look at them and
   start thinking that I would like to work with youngsters, to train them
   and coach them, but right now I honestly can’t see it happening. It
   might happen over the new few years, though. I don’t know.

And talking of coach, we have to ask you about Diego Maradona’s return to
Argentinian football. Did you see him take up his new job?

   Yes, I saw it. Obviously I’m delighted to see him back, to see him
   coaching again. I was there when he was in charge of the national team
   and he really enjoyed it, lived it to the maximum. He has to do the
   same now with Gimnasia. I’m delighted he’s back in Argentinian
   football, which is where he has to be if you ask me.

And what about you? Are you thinking of ending your career back in Argentina?

   Yes. That’s what I’ve always said, haven’t I? It’s a childhood dream of
   mine to play in the Newell’s shirt, though I don’t know if I can make
   it happen. It’s not just down to me, though. I’ve got three children.

La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa America: what is Lionel Messi’s
main objective this season?

   All of them. It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League
   and we really want to win it again. We know, though, that if we don’t
   do the job day in day out, then we won’t make it. And as for the Copa
   America, I’m really looking forward to having the opportunity to go for
   it yet again. I’m really excited about this year’s Copa.

Asian pair earn passage to world stage

     * Pair join hosts India for next year's tournament
     * Next year's competition will run 2-21 November

   Asia’s line-up for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is complete as
   Korea DPR and Japan booked their berths at the tournament, joining
   hosts India, after progressing to the final of the AFC U-16 Women’s
   Championship.

   Kim Hye-yong bagged a brace before Kim Pom-I added another late on as
   Korea DPR advanced to Saturday’s decider after beating Australia 3-0
   and secured a seventh successive top-two finish at the AFC U-16 Women’s
   Championship.

   “It was very a difficult match for our girls, but we scored three goals
   and conceded none and we very happy that we got the ticket to the FIFA
   U-17 Women’s World Cup,” Hwang Yong-song, Korea DPR head coach, told
   the-afc.com. “The team’s responsibility is getting higher because we
   are going to represent Asian teams.”

   In their way of Thailand 2019 glory lies Japan, who battled to a 2-0
   victory over China PR with second-half goals coming from Hanon Nishio
   Maika and Maika Hamano.

   “We were expecting the game to be tough because we both played
   aggressively from the start,” Japan head coach Michihisa Kano told
   the-afc.com. “It was difficult in the first half, but the players were
   patient and calm, and then we scored the two goals. So, we’re very
   pleased.”

   Both finalists join the hosts at India 2020, which takes place next
   year from 2-21 November. Both Korea DPR and Japan exited the U-17
   Women's World Cup at the quarter-final stage last year at Uruguay 2018.

   In an opulent ceremony that saw a star-studded cast of footballing
   talent descend on Milan’s Teatro alla Scala, the beautiful game’s
   foremost artistes saw their performances rewarded at The Best FIFA
   Football Awards™ in one of the globe’s cultural centres.

   Lionel Messi and Jurgen Klopp took home the leading honours for The
   Best FIFA Men’s Player and Men’s Coach respectively, after their
   outstanding 2018/19 campaigns which saw both scoop silverware and
   individual accolades galore. It was a bumper year for the USA as Megan
   Rapinoe and Jill Ellis were rewarded for their part in the Stars and
   Stripes’ triumph at the FIFA Women’s World Cup France 2019™ as The Best
   FIFA Women’s Player and Women’s Coach respectively.

     Megan Rapinoe: The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019 acceptance speech

     An empassioned speech from 🇺🇸 Megan Rapinoe 😍 Having had an amazing
     2019, where she won her second FIFA Women's World Cup title, the
     U.S. Soccer star was crowned as #TheBest FIFA Women's Player. 🏆🏆
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Monday, 23 September 2019

   In an event very much geared towards celebrating the women’s game, to
   honour the legacy of the record-breaking France 2019, Sari van
   Veenendaal was named the inaugural The Best FIFA Women’s Goalkeeper,
   joining her custodian counterpart Alisson who picked up The Best FIFA
   Men’s Goalkeeper award.

   There was recognition for a women’s ‘dream team’ for the first time at
   The Best FIFA Football Awards, with FIFA and FIFPro combining for the
   first time to honour the FIFA FIFPro Women’s World11. The recipients of
   the inaugural award were a veritable who’s who of France 2019, with the
   aforementioned Sari van Veenendaal joined by USA stars Kelley O’Hara,
   Julie Ertz, Rose Lavelle, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe as well as
   French duo Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry, Brazilian legend Marta,
   England’s outstanding performer Lucy Bronze and Swedish rock Nilla
   Fischer.

   The FIFA FIFPro Men’s World11 saw a number of new names enter the fray.
   Alisson made his debut in the ‘dream team’, alongside Dutch trio
   Matthijs de Ligt, Frenkie de Jong and Virgil van Dijk. The remainder of
   the side - Marcelo, Sergio Ramos, Eden Hazard, Luka Modric, Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi - retained their place from the
   2018 World11. Both star-studded line-ups were elected by thousands of
   players from across the globe.

   The players had their say, and so did the fans, who voted for the
   heartwarming story of Silvia Grecco to take home the FIFA Fan Award. A
   public vote also determined the top three of the FIFA Puskás Award,
   with a panel of FIFA Legends ultimately choosing Daniel Zsori’s
   remarkable overhead kick as a worthy goal of the year.

   The FIFA Fair Play Award was taken home by Marcelo Bielsa and the Leeds
   United squad, after the Argentinean coach and his team ultimately
   sacrificed promotion for his team to uphold the values of fair play –
   instructing his Leeds United team to allow an equaliser after his side
   had gone 1-0 up with an opposition player down injured.

   In an evening that saw the remarkable talents of the Teatro alla Scala
   Orchestra showcased as the musical entertainment, it was fitting that
   the orchestrators of beautiful music on pitches the world over were
   recognised as The Best in Milano.
