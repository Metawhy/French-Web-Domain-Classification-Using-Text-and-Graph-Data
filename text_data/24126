   Alela Diane - Cusp Alela Diane’s sixth album Cusp comes five years
   after her last record About Farewell and was inspired by the birth of
   her second daughter. It is unapologetically an album about motherhood
   and all of the life-changing moments and responsibilities that come
   with it. But any misplaced concerns that this will somehow have an
   adverse effect on the quality of music should be immediately swept
   aside. She handles the subject in a very considered, light-handed yet
   emotionally engaging way. Importantly, the songs are stronger, melodies
   brighter, structures clearer and emotions deeper than ever before. The
   fact that she came close to dying during childbirth reinforces this
   last point, and explains the album’s title. “Life and death meet in a
   cusp,” Diane comments.

   Piano plays a bigger role than in earlier work, a move away from the
   delicate guitar backing of last two albums (although previous
   collaborator Ryan Francesconi does appear once again, as do a range of
   other guests like Peter Broderick). The shift to piano was primarily
   due to her breaking a thumbnail at the time of recording, but the
   softness of the instrument suits the subject matter well.

   It also helps position her quite closely to Agnes Obel, while the
   enduring influence of Kristin Hersh is also present in the rich, quiet
   power of her vocals, at times shaded, at other times guarded. There’s a
   consistency to the songs and arrangements that previous albums may have
   lacked. Albatross and Threshold signal a reflective, scrutinising
   beginning and Moves Us Blind showcases the experience-borne maturity
   that now defines her music.

   Émigré stands out, a song about the ongoing international refugee
   crisis. It recounts the story of a group of people taking a precarious
   journey by sea to hopefully a better life elsewhere. Diane sings in the
   first person, recounting how “I can feel the fear hang heavy on the
   water” and “this vessel cannot bear the burden of our load”. The sense
   of desperation is conveyed in lucid, spine-tingling fashion. Musically
   it’s also the closest she comes to the folky roots of her debut album.

   Never Easy is about overcoming the adversity that motherhood and life
   in general can sometimes bring. Song For Sandy (dedicated to Sandy
   Denny, who died shortly after the birth of Diane’s first child) is
   another song that is positively over-brimming with poignancy, detailing
   stories from lives beset with difficulty and challenges. Lyrically it
   might be heavy going but these are sustaining, rewarding songs. Ether
   And Wood further confirms that Cusp contains her most affecting work to
   date and Yellow Gold excels in sharing small lyrical details that so
   accurately depict parenthood.

   Wild Ceaseless Song sees her directly address her daughter while
   referencing generations (both past and future) of her family. It’s a
   stunningly beautiful end to a wonderful album, undoubtedly a career
   best and an exemplary case study in how to respond artistically to a
   life-changing event.

                              Alela Diane – Cusp

   Steven Johnson

   2 years ago

   Alela Diane - Cusp Alela Diane’s sixth album Cusp comes five years
   after her last record About Farewell and was inspired by the birth of
   her second daughter. It is unapologetically an album about motherhood
   and all of the life-changing moments and responsibilities that come
   with it. But any misplaced concerns that this will somehow have an
   adverse effect on the quality of music should be immediately swept
   aside. She handles the subject in a very considered, light-handed yet
   emotionally engaging way. Importantly, the songs are stronger, melodies
   brighter, structures clearer and emotions deeper than ever before. The
   fact that she came close to dying during childbirth reinforces this
   last point, and explains the album’s title. “Life and death meet in a
   cusp,” Diane comments.

   Piano plays a bigger role than in earlier work, a move away from the
   delicate guitar backing of last two albums (although previous
   collaborator Ryan Francesconi does appear once again, as do a range of
   other guests like Peter Broderick). The shift to piano was primarily
   due to her breaking a thumbnail at the time of recording, but the
   softness of the instrument suits the subject matter well.

   It also helps position her quite closely to Agnes Obel, while the
   enduring influence of Kristin Hersh is also present in the rich, quiet
   power of her vocals, at times shaded, at other times guarded. There’s a
   consistency to the songs and arrangements that previous albums may have
   lacked. Albatross and Threshold signal a reflective, scrutinising
   beginning and Moves Us Blind showcases the experience-borne maturity
   that now defines her music.

   Émigré stands out, a song about the ongoing international refugee
   crisis. It recounts the story of a group of people taking a precarious
   journey by sea to hopefully a better life elsewhere. Diane sings in the
   first person, recounting how “I can feel the fear hang heavy on the
   water” and “this vessel cannot bear the burden of our load”. The sense
   of desperation is conveyed in lucid, spine-tingling fashion. Musically
   it’s also the closest she comes to the folky roots of her debut album.

   Never Easy is about overcoming the adversity that motherhood and life
   in general can sometimes bring. Song For Sandy (dedicated to Sandy
   Denny, who died shortly after the birth of Diane’s first child) is
   another song that is positively over-brimming with poignancy, detailing
   stories from lives beset with difficulty and challenges. Lyrically it
   might be heavy going but these are sustaining, rewarding songs. Ether
   And Wood further confirms that Cusp contains her most affecting work to
   date and Yellow Gold excels in sharing small lyrical details that so
   accurately depict parenthood.

   Wild Ceaseless Song sees her directly address her daughter while
   referencing generations (both past and future) of her family. It’s a
   stunningly beautiful end to a wonderful album, undoubtedly a career
   best and an exemplary case study in how to respond artistically to a
   life-changing event.
