Kwik Paint Stix

   I know it's been forever since I posted something other than a sale but
   I found a really cool item I just had to share. I went to Grandparent's
   Day at my grandson's school and got to visit the art class. They had
   these REALLY COOL paint sticks to paint with. I'm probably late to the
   party and you all ready know about them. They were so fun that I just
   had to come home and order some for myself.
   [81qPXXHgH9L._SL1500_.jpg]
   They come in a 12 count or 24 count pack with lots of bright colors.
   They dry almost instantly. They look just like a glue stick but instead
   of sticky they are paint. They only cost a little more than a pack of
   markers. You can get them at Amazon.com HERE
   My grandchildren LOVE using them!
   [IMG_6305.JPG]
    I can think of lots of ways I could use these in my classroom from
   tracing letters & numbers to writing spelling or sight words.
   THANKS Mrs. Olds at North Point Elementary in Lehi, Utah for
   introducing me (and my grandsons) to these cool paint sticks.

2 Digit Math Olympics

   A while back, a great teacher friend asked me to make an Olympic Math
   packet for her. I forgot that I hadn't put it in my shop. So here it
   is:
   [Math%2BOlympics%2B5.PNG]
   With the Olympics in full swing, this would be a fun way to review 2
   digit math.
    There is one sheet for each skill with 3 levels of difficulty on each
   sheet.
   The skills are:
   2 digit addition- counting on
   2 digit subtraction-counting back
   2 digit addition- partners of 10
   2 digit subtraction- partners of 10
   2 digit addition- doubles
   2 digit subtraction- doubles reversed
   2 digit addition- doubles +1
   2 digit addition- make 10 with 7,8,9
   2 digit addition-10+
   My friend uses these in her 2nd grade class and the kiddos LOVE them!
   The packet is now in my TpT shop!
   Thanks Collette!
