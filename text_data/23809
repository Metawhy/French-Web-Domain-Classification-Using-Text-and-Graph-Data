Privacy Policy

   Last updated: August 9, 2018

   This Privacy Policy applies to Apester.com and any of its affiliated
   websites, applications and other digital services in connection with
   which this Privacy Policy is linked or posted (collectively,
   “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is
   collected offline or by any third-party websites or services that you
   may access through the Services.

   This Privacy Policy explains how Apester Ltd. (collectively, “Apester”)
   collects and uses data and information that may identify or can be
   directly associated with an individual person (“Personal Information”).
   Apester respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed
   choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This
   Privacy Policy explains Apester’s policy regarding the collection, use,
   disclosure and protection of any information we receive including your
   Personal Information (if any).

   Apester provides a platform where content publishers (“Publisher”) can
   create, embed and share interactive content units, including but not
   limited to: online quizzes, questionnaires, feedback applications or
   other features (“Platform”), that can be distributed and offered on the
   content publisher’s website, application, mobile app or service
   (“Publisher Site”) and the end users of the Publisher Site can interact
   with (“End Users”). In this policy “Publisher” refers to any third
   party that downloads, implements or makes use of the Platform and/or
   the Services.
   This Privacy Policy applies both to Personal Information collected from
   employees of Publishers (“Publisher Employees”) and End Users
   (collectively with Publisher’s Employees and those accessing the
   Apester.com website, “User” or “Users”).

Information Apester Collects from End Users

   Apester uses the Platform and/or Services to collect information
   regarding End Users’ activities and operations that interact with the
   Platform or that interact with any content that may be available
   through the Platform. Such information includes IP-address, Session ID,
   browser type, mobile or desktop ID, referrer, user language and
   feedback or answers provided by the End User to any interactive content
   unit made available with the Platform. Such information may qualify as
   Personal Information in some End Users’ jurisdictions, however, we do
   not make any use of such data to directly identify individuals or to
   associate it with individuals.

Information Apester collects from Publishers

   In order to use the Platform or Services, Publishers have to enroll on
   Apester’s website and create an account by providing certain data, such
   as a user name and email-address and certain other information that may
   be provided from Publisher to Apester. Apester will also create a
   unique user ID to each Publisher. Where this data is attributable to a
   certain Publisher Employee, this may also qualify Personal Information
   that is collected by Apester.
   Information Apester collects from visitors of the Apester.com website
   When you access the Apester.com website, we may collect information
   from the computer or device that you use to access the Services, such
   as your operating system type, browser type, domain and other system
   settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and
   time zone in which your computer or device is located.

How Apester Protects Information

   Apester follows applicable laws and generally accepted industry
   standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Apester by
   implementing adequate technical and organizational protection measures,
   both during transmission and once Apester receives it. These measures
   will be continuously adjusted and updated in accordance with current
   industry standards. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
   method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while
   Apester strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect
   Personal Information, Apester cannot guarantee its absolute security.

How Apester Uses Information

   Where required by applicable laws, Apester will only process, use or
   share User’s Personal Information with third parties with User’s
   explicit permission or as described in this Privacy Policy. Apester
   will only disclose Personal Information as described in this Privacy
   Policy or where required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order.
   Apester uses Personal Information to the extent necessary for internal
   purposes – for example, in connection with offering the Services, to
   help diagnose problems with Apester’s servers, to make Apester’s
   Services more useful, or to improve the Platform.

Use of Publisher’s Employee Personal Information:

   Apester collects, processes and uses Customer’s Employee Personal
   Information for purposes of administering the Services, and to improve
   the experience of the Apester Services.

Use of End User’s Personal Information:

   Apester may use information it collects, including Personal
   Information, to provide the End User with the Services and in order to
   provide End Users with advertising that Apester reasonably believes may
   be more useful or interesting to the End User. The Personal Information
   collected by Apester will not be connected by Apester to any other
   personal information collected by third parties for advertisement
   purposes. In addition, by analyzing all information Apester receives,
   including all information concerning End Users and their interaction
   with the Platform and content made available through the Platform,
   Apester may irreversibly compile aggregated statistical information
   across a variety of mobile applications and End Users (“Statistical
   Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and
   customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and
   so existing products and services can be improved and tailored to
   customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and does not, in
   and of itself, identify any specific end user or customer of Apester.
   Apester may share such Statistical Information with its partners or any
   third party, without restriction, on commercial terms that Apester can
   determine in its sole discretion.
   Personal Information is not transferred or disclosed to third parties
   other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Opt-Out

   If End User does not wish its Personal Information to be collected,
   processed or shared for the above purposes, he may opt out from this
   use with effect for the future. For opting out, the End User can do so
   by turning off the toggle below.

Cookies

   A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to the End User’s
   browser and stored on his computer or mobile device. All cookies used
   by Apester are persistent cookies, i.e. they will be stored on the
   User’s device after the browser session has expired. Any cookie will be
   deleted within one month after it has been placed unless configured
   otherwise. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept
   cookies, but the User can change this setting so his browser either
   refuses all cookies or informs him when a cookie is being sent. Also,
   the User is free to delete any existing cookies at any time with future
   effect. Some features of Apester’s Services may not function properly
   when cookies are disabled or removed.
   Cookies placed on End Users’ computers:
   Cookies placed on an End User’s computer will transmit the End User’s
   Personal Information as specified above to Apester for the purposes
   also specified above.
   Cookies placed on Publishers’ computers:
   Apester also uses cookies to help personalize Publisher’s Apester
   experience. These could be “persistent” cookies that may be used to
   help save Publisher’s settings and customizations across website
   visits. Also, if Publisher logs in to Apester, such a cookie will be
   used to recognize Publisher as a valid user so Publisher will not need
   to login each time using Apester.

Online Links to Other Sites

Links to third-party websites

   Apester may link to other websites of third-parties that provide useful
   information/services. Any information User provides on the linked pages
   is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that
   third-party’s provider’s privacy policy. Apester is not responsible for
   the content or privacy practices of Web sites to which it links. Links
   from Apester’s site to third parties or other sites are provided for
   User’s convenience. You should learn about the privacy practices of
   each web site before providing them with Personal Information.

Social media websites and widgets

   Apester may link to other websites of third-parties that provide useful
   information/services. Any information User provides on the linked pages
   is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that
   third-party’s provider’s privacy policy. Apester is not responsible for
   the content or privacy practices of Web sites to which it links. Links
   from Apester’s site to third parties or other sites are provided for
   User’s convenience. You should learn about the privacy practices of

Use of Apester by Children

   Apester does not knowingly collect Personal Information from
   individuals under the age of 18. In the event you become aware that an
   individual under the age of 13 has enrolled without parental
   permission, please advise us immediately.

Other Uses or Transfer of User’s Information

   Apester will disclose any information, including Personal Information,
   to the extent required by applicable law. Apester will fully cooperate
   with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or
   directing it to disclose the identity, behavior or digital content of
   any User suspected to have engaged in illegal or infringing behavior.
   Uses of Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy may be
   accomplished by Apester or its service providers. In providing the
   Platform and Services, Apester may use subcontractors or service
   providers that are located in countries other than User’s own,
   including countries that might be outside the European Economic Area,
   and transfer to them Personal Information Apester collects and
   processes as further specified in here.
   Apester currently uses Google Cloud Services as a cloud and storage
   service provider with servers in the US, and where information obtained
   from the Platform or Apester’s website is stored. Google Cloud’s terms
   and privacy policy is available at: https://cloud.google.com/terms/ and
   here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. The Cloud Services are
   Privacy Shield certified (information can be found here:
   https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/eu-data-protection/).
   Apester uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by
   Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
   (“Google”). Google places cookies on User’s computer to analyze User’s
   use of the Platform and the Apester website. The information collected
   by the cookie is transferred to and stored on Google servers located in
   the US. Apester is using commercially reasonable efforts to leverage
   the IP-anonymization service of Google, i.e. a service offered by
   Google whereby a User’s IP address will be shortened before transfer to
   the US. After shortening the IP addresses, the collected data cannot be
   directly matched to a User. Google will process and use the collected
   information on behalf of Apester in order to analyze User’s use of the
   Platform and the Apester website, to compose respective reports and to
   provide certain other services to Apester related to the use of the
   Platform and the Apester website. The IP address collected by the
   cookie will not be collated with other Google data. User can change the
   settings of his browser so it refuses all cookies of third parties.
   Also, User is free to delete any existing cookies at any time with
   future effect. User can also contradict the collection and use of data
   by the Google cookie by installing the browser plugin available for
   download under the following hyperlink:
   https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. For further information
   regarding Google Analytics please see examples of Google’s terms of use
   (https://www.google.com/analytics/terms), data protection overview
   (http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/learn/privacy.html) and
   privacy policy (www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy).
   Apester may share some of the information collected via the Platform
   with certain trusted partners and/or technology platforms in order to
   present personalized advertisements to Users. In such cases, the
   transfer and storage practices of the information shall be governed by
   the policies provided by such partners and/or technology platforms.
   Apester uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all its
   service providers will be subject to nondisclosure and non-use
   obligations and bound to process Personal Information solely as
   instructed by Apester in a separate Data Processing Agreement as
   required under applicable law. Nevertheless, some countries where
   Apester’s service providers are located may have levels of protection
   of personal and other information which are not as high as in the
   User’s country of residence or business.
   Apester may transfer its databases containing Personal Information of
   Users in connection with a sale of its business or assets or any part
   of them that requires the use of the databases.
   Apester may transfer Personal Information to other countries whose
   privacy laws may not be as protective as in your place of residence. By
   providing your Personal Information to us, you consent to the transfer
   of your Personal Information to other countries for processing

   of such information consistent with the other terms of this Privacy
   Policy.

Apester Analytics

   Apester Analytics allows publishers and marketers to track their
   content performance from the macro perspective of a content channel,
   all the way down to the micro level of slides - this makes Apester the
   most comprehensive analytics dashboard for a Story player in the
   market.

   Launched in 2018, Analytics offers a broad set of metrics that lets you
   view the big picture around engagement and monetization of each story,
   poll, or quiz created within the Apester platform across locations and
   platforms.

Instant Story Strip

   With the new Instant Story Strip feature, you can create several
   stories in an instant. Once you embed an Apester header code, the
   Instant Story Strip knows which articles are trending on your site and
   automatically creates stories for those articles.

The Story Suite

   Apester’s flagship format brings the experience users know and love
   from Snapchat & Instagram into a format publishers can add to their
   articles in minutes and distribute them at scale.

   Monetize your multi-frame stories with Apester's streaming video and
   display ad inventory; distribute them across your online properties
   with the Story Strip, a carousel of your site’s live Stories, located
   at the top of an article or a section page; and easily export your
   stories to your social accounts, such as Instagram or Snapchat.
