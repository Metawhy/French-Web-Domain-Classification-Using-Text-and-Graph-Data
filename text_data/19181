   operating system, overtook Windows 7 for the first time globally in
   January according to independent web analytics company, Statcounter.
   Its research arm Statcounter Global Stats finds that Windows 10 reached
   42.78% in terms of worldwide internet usage compared to 41.86% for

   launched at the end of July 2015 and Microsoft will be pleased to have
   put its Windows 8 experience behind it. However, Windows 7 retains

   2001, which only fell below 5% usage worldwide in June of 2017.&rdquo;

   Microsoft no longer owns dominant OS Android now world&rsquo;s most
   popular operating system in terms of internet usage San Francisco, CA
   and Dublin, Ireland; 3rd April, 2017: Google&rsquo;s Android has
   overtaken Microsoft Windows for the first time as the world&rsquo;s
   most popular operating system (OS) in terms of total internet usage
   across desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile combined. The research arm of
   StatCounter, the independent web analytics company, finds that in
   March, Android topped the worldwide OS internet usage market share with
   37.93%, which puts it marginally ahead of Windows&nbsp; (37.91%) for
   the first time. &ldquo;This is a milestone in technology history and
   the end of an era,&rdquo; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   &nbsp;&ldquo;It marks the end of Microsoft&rsquo;s leadership worldwide
   of the OS market which it has held since the 1980s. &nbsp;It also
   represents a major breakthrough for Android which held just 2.4% of
   global internet usage share only five years ago.&rdquo; Cullen said
   that main drivers of the breakthrough were growth of smartphones to
   access the internet, a decline in sales of traditional PCs and the
   impact of Asia on the global market. However, Windows still dominates
   the worldwide operating system desktop market (PC and laptop) with a
   84% internet usage share in March. &ldquo;Windows won the desktop war
   but the battlefield moved on,&rdquo; said Cullen. &quot;It will be
   difficult for Microsoft to make inroads in mobile but the next paradigm
   shift might give it the opportunity to regain dominance. That could be
   in Augmented Reality, AI, Voice or Continuum (a product that aims to
   replace &nbsp;a desktop and smartphone with a single Microsoft powered
   phone).&quot; In North America Windows (all versions) maintained its
   lead across all platforms with 39.5% share in March followed by iOS
   (25.7%) and Android (21.2%). It&rsquo;s a similar story in Europe where
   Windows (51.7%) is more than twice the level of Android (23.6%).
   However, in Asia, Android is on 52.2% compared to 29.2% for Windows. OS

   Dublin, Ireland;&nbsp; 28th March 2017: Indians are amongst the world
   leaders in terms of internet usage from mobile phones, according to
   StatCounter, the independent web analytics company. Its research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that 79% of internet usage was made by
   Indians through mobiles in February compared to 49.7% for the world in
   general. Indian mobile usage to surf the internet is more than double
   that in the UK (34.8%) or US (37.2%). Of G20 nations, India is the
   number one user of mobile in terms of internet usage. StatCounter is
   one of the leading web analytics firms in the world with a considerable
   market share in India. StatCounter&rsquo;s (http://statcounter.com)
   core business is to provide members with data to measure visitor
   activity on their website, blog or forum. Key features include a free
   option, ease of use, independence and ability to view data in real
   time. &ldquo;Our research confirms that Indians adore their mobiles for
   surfing the internet,&rdquo; commented Tarak Desai of StatCounter in
   Mumbai. &nbsp;&ldquo;Internet usage by mobile in India is striking
   compared to most other countries.&rdquo; He added that the trend was
   accelerating. &ldquo;Internet usage in India by desktop and tablet fell
   from 33.2% in January 2016 to 21% this year. Mobile jumped from 66.8%
   to 79% over the same time period.&rdquo; Desai said that the move by
   new player Reliance JIO with over a 100 million subscribers to offer
   free 4G data (1GB per day limit) over the last six months until April
   1st was probably one but not the only reason for the acceleration in

   war but battlefield has moved on&rdquo; San Francisco, CA and Dublin,
   Ireland; 7th March, 2017: In what StatCounter describes as
   &ldquo;unthinkable five years ago&rdquo;, Google&rsquo;s Android is
   challenging Microsoft Windows as the world&rsquo;s most popular
   operating system (OS) in terms of total internet usage across desktop,
   laptop, tablet and mobile combined. The research arm of StatCounter,
   the independent web analytics company, finds that in February 2017,
   while Windows remained top of worldwide OS internet usage market share
   with 38.6%, Android came within striking distance on 37.4%. &ldquo;The
   idea of Android almost matching Windows would have been unthinkable
   five years ago,&rdquo; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   &nbsp;&ldquo;In January 2012 Windows held 82% global internet usage
   share compared to just 2.2% for Android.&rdquo; He said that the
   development was a function of the growth of smartphones to access the
   internet as well as a slowdown in sales of traditional PCs plus the
   impact of Asia on the global market. Windows still dominates the
   worldwide operating system desktop market (PC and laptop) with a 84.1%
   internet usage share in February. &ldquo;Windows has won the desktop
   war but the battlefield has moved on,&rdquo; said Cullen. StatCounter
   recently reported that in October 2016 internet usage by mobile and
   tablet devices exceeded desktop and laptop worldwide for the first
   time. In North America Windows (all versions) maintained its lead
   across all platforms with 40.7% share in February followed by iOS
   (24.9%) and Android (20.3%). It&rsquo;s a similar story in Europe where
   Windows (51.8%) is more than twice the level of Android (23.5%).
   However, in Asia, Android is now over 50% (51.8%) compared to 29.8% for
   Windows. OS market share map:

   StatCounter data also finds that Windows 10 overtook Windows 7 for the
   first time in North America in December. &ldquo;Windows 10 will need to
   maintain momentum in order to combat the steady march of Android across
   all markets,&rdquo; added Aodhan Cullen. The data is based on
   StatCounter Global Stats for which the company has recently released a
   major upgrade. This provides media, researchers, analysts and
   interested consumers with a free service to help analyse internet wars

   Monday, 1st February 2016: Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system
   overtook 8.1 for the first time globally in January, according to
   independent web analytics company StatCounter. Its analytics arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that Windows 10 hit 13.7% in terms of
   desktop internet usage compared to 11.7% for Windows 8.1. Microsoft's
   latest operating system is still some way behind Windows 7 which
   represented 46.7% of internet usage worldwide in January. Graph:

   still leads the US on 40.5%. In the UK Windows 10 is powering ahead
   with 22.4% in January compared to 12.5% for 8.1. Win 10 overtook 8.1 in
   October. Windows 7 represents 36.8% of internet usage in the UK.
   "Microsoft's determined promotion of Windows 10 seems to be having an
   impact," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "However, there
   remains a lot of loyalty to Windows 7 and it will be interesting to see
   if it becomes the equivalent of XP which, 14 years after launch,
   refuses to lie down and still has a 8% global share in terms of desktop
   internet use." StatCounter analysis of the first six months finds that
   Windows 10 usage is greater than Windows 8 and Windows 7 over the same
   time period globally, in the US and UK. Worldwide usage of Windows 10

   since-marissa-mayer-appointment StatCounter analysis highlights
   difficulty in challenging Google's search share in US and
   worldwideAnalysis follows Yahoo announcement of reverse spin off San
   Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Wednesday, 9th December 2015:
   Yahoo's share of search referrals in the US fell from 7.6% in July
   2012, when Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO, to 7.4% last
   month (November), according to data from independent website analytics
   provider, StatCounter. The analysis comes following Yahoo's
   announcement Wednesday of a reverse spin off plan. StatCounter's
   research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that Yahoo's US share fell
   by 2.6% since July 2012. (Note: analysis covers all platforms including
   desktop, mobile, tablet and console). Yahoo peaked in the US at 10.2%
   in January 2015 after Mozilla made it the default search engine for
   Firefox 34 users. Between July 2012 and November 2015 Bing also fell,
   from 8.25% to 7.82% in the US, a loss of 5.2%. Google increased its US
   share by 1.3% from 82.4% to 83.5%. US graph:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-search_engine-US-monthly-201207-201511
   "Despite Bing's integration with Windows 10 and Yahoo's partnership
   with Firefox* it is proving difficult for anyone to challenge Google's
   lead in search share," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. This
   is borne out by Google's worldwide search share. StatCounter reports
   that in November 2015 Google held 91.5%, little changed from 91.75% in
   July 2012. Worldwide Yahoo is at 2.96% compared to 2.86% at the time of
   Marissa Mayer's appointment. During the same time, Bing fell from 2.96%
   to 2.82%. Worldwide graph:

   In the UK Yahoo is currently on 3.37%, up from 2.26% in July 2012. Bing

   April 2015: Apple's Safari browser accounted for over half of US mobile
   and tablet internet usage in March according to independent website
   analytics provider, StatCounter. "This emphasises the potential prize
   in the rapidly growing mobile space for Yahoo, Bing or others if Apple
   decides to end its default search deal with Google," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. In a quarterly earnings call in January, CEO
   Marissa Mayer said that Yahoo was definitely in the search distribution
   business and anyone who is in that business needs to be interested in
   the Safari deal. StatCounter Global Stats reports that in March Safari
   took 55% of US mobile and tablet usage share followed by Chrome on
   29.9% and Android on 9.5%. See US chart:

   sage http://gs.statcounter.com/press/yahoo-growth-stalls San Francisco,
   CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 2nd March 2015: Yahoo's recent growth
   in US search share came to a halt in February but it has largely
   maintained the gains it made over January and December, according to
   data from independent website analytics provider, StatCounter.
   StatCounter Global Stats reports that in February, Google took 74.9% of
   US search referrals followed by Bing on 12.5% and Yahoo on 10.7%, down
   marginally from 10.9% the previous month. "While Yahoo's search growth
   from the Mozilla deal has stalled, its share declined only slightly in
   February," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "It will be
   interesting to see if January was the month of peak impact for Yahoo as
   a result of the Mozilla deal and whether it can maintain its gains over
   the next few months." StatCounter separately analysed search share by
   US Firefox users only. It found that in February for the US
   Google-on-Firefox was at 65.1% (up from 63.9% in January);
   Yahoo-on-Firefox usage was at 27.3% (down from 28.3%) and
   Bing-on-Firefox was at 5.9% (down from 6.2%). StatCounter says that it
   was not just Firefox users that led to the small decline. Yahoo usage
   in the US excluding Firefox users was also down slightly from 8.2% in
   January to 8.1% in February. Firefox users generated 14% of US internet
   usage in February according to StatCounter, whose main business is to

   November San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 2nd February
   2015: January saw Yahoo further increase the gain it made in US search
   share last month, according to the latest data from independent website
   analytics provider, StatCounter. Google fell below 75% in the US for
   the first time since StatCounter Global Stats began recording data*.
   StatCounter Global Stats reports that in January, Google took 74.8% of
   US search referrals followed by Bing on 12.4% and Yahoo on 10.9%, its
   highest US search share for over five years. "Some analysts expected
   Yahoo to fall in January as a result of Firefox users switching back to
   Google. In fact Yahoo has increased US search share by half a
   percentage point," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "It will
   be fascinating to see if these gains continue." StatCounter has also
   run a special report on US search engine usage by Firefox users only.
   Yahoo-on-Firefox usage in the US increased from 9.9% in November 2014
   to 28.3% in January. Over the same period Google-on-Firefox usage in
   the US fell from 81.9% to 63.9%. StatCounter says that it is only
   Firefox users responsible for the change in US search share. "When we
   removed Firefox usage from the US search data, Yahoo's gains and
   Google's losses were erased," commented Aodhan Cullen. "This highlights
   the importance of the default search option and the significance of the
   upcoming Safari search deal for the major players." Firefox users
   generated 14% of US internet usage in January according to StatCounter,
   whose main business is to provide independent website analytics,
   including a free option. StatCounter (www.statcounter.com) members
   include companies, agencies, bloggers, self-employed, charities and

   2014: On the 2nd December in the US, Yahoo search was used 3 times more
   on Firefox 34 than on Firefox 33, according to StatCounter, the
   independent website analytics company. As previously announced by
   Yahoo, this month marks the start of its partnership with Mozilla.
   Yahoo is now the default search experience for Firefox 34 in the US,
   replacing Mozilla's 10 year relationship with Google. A special report
   from StatCounter Global Stats finds that Yahoo usage on Firefox 34 in
   the US on the 2nd December was 29.4% compared to 9.6% for the previous
   version Firefox 33. Google search usage by Firefox users dropped from
   82.1% to 63.5% as they upgraded from version 33 to 34. Bing declined
   slightly from 6.5% on Firefox 33 to 5.8% on Firefox 34. "Firefox 34 is
   still being rolled out so its usage is currently quite low. It will be
   interesting to see how this develops," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "At the moment the change is having a negligible impact on
   overall search share in the US, but if this early usage trend on
   Firefox 34 continues then Yahoo could be on course to gain a number of
   percentage points." On the 2nd December overall search share across all
   browsers in the US was 78% for Google, 12.4% for Bing and 7.9% for
   Yahoo. See:

   StatCounter announces new web analytics apps San Francisco, CA &amp;
   Dublin, Ireland; Thursday 18th September 2014: The use of mobile
   devices to access the internet has increased by 67% worldwide over the
   last 12 months according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. The report from the company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats, finds that while desktop remains the most
   popular means to access the web on 64.6%, mobile has grown rapidly from
   17.1% to 28.5%. Tablet devices account for 6.8% of internet usage,
   compared to 4.8% 12 months ago. StatCounter announced the findings to
   mark the launch of its new web analytics apps for iOS and Android.
   These apps, which are free to download and use, are available from
   iTunes or Google Play. "Mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in
   several countries including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "All indications are that
   this trend is set to continue, which creates new challenges and
   opportunities for businesses globally." He noted that just three years
   ago desktop was the number one platform across all countries.
   StatCounter has produced an animated world map to show how this has
   changed since then. Mobile internet usage in the US has grown by 73%
   over the last 12 months to reach 24.4% in August. UK mobile internet
   usage is up by 69% to 23.2%. Other individual country stats are
   available at
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-monthly-201308-201408.
   Cullen added that mobile internet usage is increasing faster than
   tablet usage. "The slower growth of tablets may be due to the trend
   towards larger screen smartphones. It will be interesting to see
   whether Apple's new larger iPhone 6 Plus becomes a tablet killer."
   StatCounter Global Stats data is based on over 15 billion page views
   per month to over three million websites. Independent web analytics
   specialist StatCounter (www.statcounter.com) tracks millions of
   websites globally. Its new mobile website analytics apps allow members
   to view familiar StatCounter reports including weekly traffic trend
   analysis; recent visitor activity; incoming traffic sources plus other

   -iphone-6-announcement "Augurs well" for rumored launch of larger
   screen iPhone 6 San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 8th
   September 2014: The iPhone has been holding its own in terms of
   worldwide internet usage according to StatCounter, the independent
   website analytics company. The report from the company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats comes ahead of the expected announcement of
   the new iPhone 6 tomorrow (Tuesday). While recent reports from analysts
   such as Kantar* show falling sales figures for iPhone , Apple has
   maintained its internet usage worldwide on 23.6% in August 2014
   compared to 23.4% in the same month last year according to
   StatCounter**. At the same time Samsung has grown to 32.8% from 25.7%.
   StatCounter ranks mobile vendors based on internet usage rather than
   device sales. "Over the last year Apple has maintained its position in
   terms of internet usage despite the lack of a larger screen option, so
   this augurs well for the launch of iPhone 6," commented Aodhan Cullen,
   CEO, StatCounter. "Some analysts have predicted that iPhone will cede
   global market share to lower cost competitors in emerging markets but
   Apple probably won't lose too much sleep about this as long as they can
   win the higher margin end of the business." StatCounter research finds
   that Apple remains the clear leader in the US in terms of internet
   usage with 51.4% ahead of Samsung's 26.4%. Apple also leads in the UK
   with 46% compared to Samsung's 24.4%. Apple's operating system iOS
   (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) is also close to maintaining market share
   worldwide on 32.9% in August 2014 compared to 34.6% in the same month
   last year. Over the same period Android has increased from 35.7% to
   49.1%. Individual country stats for vendors and operating systems are

   refuses to die and remains number two globally despite end of support

   September 2014: Microsoft's Windows 8.1 operating system has overtaken
   its older sibling Windows 8 for the first time in terms of internet
   usage worldwide, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company.* The company's research arm, StatCounter Global
   Stats also finds that despite Microsoft's ending of support in April
   this year, Windows XP refuses to die and remains the world's second
   most popular operating system version. However, for the first time
   globally, the combined total of Windows 8 and 8.1 (14%) overtook XP
   (12.9%) in August. StatCounter finds that Windows 8.1 worldwide has
   grown steadily to 7.5% in August ahead of Windows 8 (6.6%). The newer
   operating system overtook its sibling in the UK in April and in the US
   in May. The data covers desktop, tablet and console. "Following a mixed
   reaction to Windows 8, perhaps because of its radical new look, Windows
   8.1 appears to be winning over users," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. However, he added that the stubborn refusal of Windows XP
   to retire almost five months after the ending of non-paid support is a
   concern in terms of security and virus risks for remaining users.
   Globally XP is on 12.9%, behind Windows 7 on 50.3%. In the US, XP
   internet usage share has declined below double figures to 8.9%.

   San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Wednesday 2nd April 2014: With
   less than a week to go before Microsoft pulls the plug on general
   support for Windows XP, it remains the second most popular operating
   system in the world in terms of internet usage, according to the latest
   data from StatCounter, the independent website analytics company. The
   company's research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that in March,
   Windows 7 was the global leader on 54.7% while XP remains in second
   place on 18.6%, more than double Mac OS X (all versions) on 8.6%.
   "Despite the stark warnings and publicity surrounding the end of
   support in six days' time, it appears that significant numbers of
   people are still using XP and sleep walking into a potential minefield
   of security and virus risks," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. Despite the risks, XP remains the second most popular OS
   in terms of internet usage in Europe (15.9%); South America (17.8%);
   Asia (24.9%) and Africa (30.5%). It is third in North America (14.5%).
   Oceania, where XP has dropped to fourth on 8%, appears to be the most
   progressive continent in terms of upgrading from the almost 13 year old
   operating system. In the US, XP is in third place on 15%. XP is also
   third in the UK with 8.4%. Individual country stats may be accessed at:

   second most popular operating system despite Microsoft's notice to end
   support San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; 4th February 2014:
   Despite news that Microsoft will discontinue support in April this year
   for Windows XP, it remains the second most popular operating system
   worldwide in terms of internet usage, according to StatCounter, the
   independent website analytics company. The company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats, finds that in January 2014 Windows 7 was the
   global leader on 54.3% while XP took 19.2% on a worldwide basis. "Even
   in mature markets like North America and the UK, XP remains ahead of
   Windows 8, 8.1 and Vista," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "This has serious implications for users, especially businesses, as
   lack of support may leave their data and systems at risk of exposure to
   security and virus issues." Microsoft has long advised that it will end
   support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014. In April 2013 it said: "This
   means that XP customers and partners will no longer receive security
   updates or be able to take advantage of tech support from Microsoft."1
   Updates for Microsoft Security Essentials, however, will be available
   until July 2015.2 Despite the risks, XP remains the second most popular
   OS in terms of internet usage in Europe (16.9%); South America (18.6%);
   Asia (26.4%) and Africa (32.0%). It is the third most popular in North
   America (12.5%); US (12.4%) and UK (9.5%). Individual country stats may

   Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 16th December, 2013: New
   data from independent web analytics firm StatCounter finds that global
   tablet internet usage was just 4.8% in November compared to 19.1% for
   mobile. Desktop usage still dominates with 76.1%.The company's research
   arm StatCounter Global Stats also reports that Apple's iPad is the
   clear leader in terms of tablet internet usage. "Samsung is in a
   distant second place although a challenge to the Cupertino company's
   lead cannot be ruled out given Samsung's success in the smartphone
   arena," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. The new data is
   revealed as StatCounter Global Stats today launches new tablet internet
   usage stats. Global and individual country stats are available free of
   charge at http://gs.statcounter.com/. StatCounter finds that worldwide
   Apple accounts for 74.5% of total tablet internet usage. Samsung has
   increased its share from 8.0% in November last year to 10.85%. "The
   perception is that tablets are proliferating and replacing traditional
   PC and laptop machines so we developed our research platform to isolate
   tablet usage stats," added Aodhan Cullen of StatCounter. "In reality we
   found that tablet internet usage globally at less than 5% is still
   relatively small compared to desktop and mobile." In the US tablet
   internet usage share stands at 6.8% or about half the mobile number
   (15.2%) with desktop on 77.9%. In the UK tablet is stronger than in the
   US on 9.6% behind mobile (14.8%) and desktop (75.4%). Out of all tablet
   internet usage in the US, Apple generates 80.3% followed by Amazon with

   San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 9th September, 2013:
   Ahead of speculation that Apple will tomorrow announce a new lower cost
   iPhone, independent web analytics company StatCounter has released
   research highlighting the challenge the Cupertino headquartered company
   faces globally from Samsung. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global
   Stats finds that Samsung, which overtook Apple for the first time
   worldwide in June in terms of internet usage, has extended its lead to
   25.7% in August compared to Apple on 23.4%. Nokia, which led globally
   up until December last, is now in third place on 21.7%. In the US Apple
   remains the clear leader on 52.2% compared to Samsung's 19%. Nokia is
   on 1.5% in the US, representing an underdog opportunity for Microsoft
   following the announcement of its proposed partial acquisition of
   Nokia. In the UK Apple is also the clear leader in the mobile vendor
   battle on 46.8% in August compared to 21.5% for Samsung and 3.7% for
   Nokia. In India, Samsung has 26.7% usage share while Apple with just 1%
   currently has significant growth potential with the rumored lower cost
   iPhone. "Over the past 12 months Apple has increased its share in the
   US and UK but globally there is an on-going battle taking place between
   it and Samsung. Should the rumors prove true, it will be fascinating to
   see if a less expensive iPhone will help it increase market against
   lower cost competitors in global markets," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO
   StatCounter. For further analysis see:

   hes-internet-wars-report Samsung overtakes Apple to claim number one
   spot globally for first time in terms of internet usage Chrome tops
   Internet Explorer in US for first time San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin,
   Ireland; Wednesday, 10th July, 2013: Samsung has overtaken Apple
   globally for the first time in June to take number one spot in terms of
   internet usage, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. In the United States Google's browser Chrome
   overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer for the first time in June.
   These are some of the findings in a new report from the firm's research
   arm, StatCounter Global Stats. The "StatCounter Internet Wars Report -
   Winners and Losers" charts progress over the last 12 months in the
   battle of the internet between the world's biggest tech firms including
   Apple, Google and Microsoft. The full report may be downloaded from:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/download/StatCounter-Internet-Wars-Report.pdf
   "The report charts winners and losers over the last 12 months in the
   battle to dominate the internet whether in the field of browsers,
   operating systems, search, mobile or social media," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. The report finds that while 12 months ago,
   Nokia led globally in terms of internet usage, Samsung (25.47%) has
   leapfrogged both Apple (25.09%) and Nokia (21.96%) to take the lead in
   June 2013. In the US and UK however, Apple remains the clear leader.
   While in May 2012 Chrome became the browser leader in terms of internet
   usage worldwide, it has now overtaken Internet Explorer for the first
   time in the United States as well. In June Chrome took the number one
   spot in the US at 34.02% (up from 23.84% 12 months ago). Over the same
   time frame IE declined to 32.46% (from 40.89%). Other highlights
   include: Operating Systems: Windows 7 increases internet usage share
   despite launch of Windows 8 - XP refuses to lie down Social Media:
   Reports of Facebook decline appear exaggerated - Twitter has greater
   referral influence in the UK than in the US Search Engines: Google
   still dominates worldwide but more competitive in US where Bing makes

   company. Samsung also climbed ahead of Nokia to take second place
   behind Apple on a worldwide basis. StatCounter's research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that in January 2013 Apple led globally
   for the first time in terms of internet usage with 25.86%, ahead of
   Samsung (22.69%) and Nokia (22.15%). "It's good and bad news for
   Apple," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Apple has been
   handed the number one spot despite its falling usage share. A decline
   in Nokia usage from January 2012 to January 2013 means the Finnish
   company ceded the top spot to Apple." He added, "Samsung, in contrast
   to Apple, has seen an increase in its usage share since January 2012."
   According to StatCounter data, Apple's worldwide internet usage share
   fell from 28.67% in January 2012 to 25.86% in the same month this year.

   Friday, 30 November 2012: Windows 8 internet usage share is behind what
   its predecessor Windows 7 achieved one month after launch, according to
   data from StatCounter, the independent web analytics company. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats finds that by 26th
   November 2012 Windows 8 had worldwide internet usage share of 1.31%
   compared to 4.93% achieved by Windows 7 one month after its launch in
   2009. In the US Windows 8 took 1.77% of internet usage one month after
   launch compared to 5.21% for Windows 7 following its introduction.
   "Microsoft has reported license sales of 40 million for Windows 8,
   however this has not yet translated into significant usage figures.
   This may be due to sales to manufacturers rather than to end users so
   Windows 8 may well get a boost over the December holiday buying
   season," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. Globally Windows 7
   had 52.4% usage on November 26th, followed by Windows XP on 26.5%. In
   the US Windows 7 had 49.48% followed by XP with 16.07% which was just
   ahead of Mac OS on 15.48%. StatCounter Global Stats data is based on
   over 15 billion page views per month (4 billion from the US) to the
   StatCounter network of more than three million websites. Apart from its
   research arm, StatCounter (http://statcounter.com/) provides free
   website stats. This service allows website owners to capture valuable
   intelligence on their site in real time. New members may sign up at

   Windows 8, some additional contextual information may be relevant. Both
   Windows 7 and Windows 8 underwent significant periods of beta testing
   before their official launch dates. In absolute terms, Windows 8 is
   behind Windows 7 one month post launch as outlined above. In relative
   terms however, Windows 8 has more than tripled its usage share in the
   first month after launch while Windows 7 only doubled its usage in the
   corresponding period. Usage Share at Launch Date* One month after

   analytics company finds eleven year old XP retains almost 30% usage
   share worldwide Boston, USA & Dublin, Ireland; Thursday, 25th October
   2012: Ahead of the launch of Windows 8, Microsoft still has a battle to
   kill off XP globally according to latest data from StatCounter, the
   independent web analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats finds that Windows XP, the operating system launched over
   10 years ago in October 2001, still has almost 30% usage share
   worldwide. Worldwide, Windows 7 held 52.2% usage share in September
   compared to 27.64% for XP. In the US Windows 7 is on 49.36% compared to
   16.42% for XP. Although it is a more recent operating system, Vista
   holds a lower share than XP with 7.58% of the global market and 11.67%
   in the US. "Our stats confirm the theory that business users in
   particular have been reluctant to move from XP," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, referring to the daily OS stats which display significant peaks
   in XP usage during the working week (Mon-Fri) combined with
   corresponding dips in the usage of Windows 7. "The new Windows 8
   interface represents a radical overhaul for Microsoft, allowing it to
   enter the tablet market with the new Surface. The scale of change of
   the desktop experience, however, may heighten the initial reluctance of
   traditional business users to upgrade to this new OS," he added. In the
   UK Windows 7 has 51.75% share followed by XP (15.57%) and Vista

   four year history of internet browsers in two minutesBoston and Dublin,
   9th July: 2012: StatCounter, the independent web analytics firm, has
   launched a new video which in less than two minutes illustrates the
   changing world map of browser usage over the last four years. The
   animation can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtBlvutR9cU.
   "When we began the StatCounter Global Stats project in 2008,
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominated the global market," comments
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "There is much greater competition
   now. Although IE still leads in countries such as the US and UK, on a
   worldwide basis Google's Chrome overtook IE in May and maintained a
   narrow lead in June." He added that IE is not taking Chrome's challenge
   lying down. From May to June, IE increased its usage share by
   two-tenths of one percentage point, the first monthly increase since
   October/November 2011. On a weekly basis, while Chrome overtook IE in
   week 20 (14 - 20 May 2012), by week 24 (11 - 17 June 2012) IE had
   staged a fight-back and was exactly equal with Chrome in terms of
   browser usage for that seven-day period. Cullen added that
   not-for-profit Mozilla's Firefox is also a real contender. "The opening
   up of competition and greater choice can only be good news for users
   and help to create better browsers." StatCounter data is based on over
   15 billion page views per month (4 billion from the US; 800 million
   from the UK) to StatCounter's network of over three million websites.

   &#8220;Browser wars back with a vengeance&#8221; Boston, USA &amp;
   Dublin, Ireland; Friday 1st June, 2012: After weeks of speculation,
   Google's Chrome has unseated Microsoft Internet Explorer to become the
   world's top internet browser for the first time for a full calendar
   month in May, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats
   says that Chrome surpassed IE for the first full day back in March and
   the achievement of the weekly milestone was widely reported on 21 May.
   For the full month of May according to StatCounter data from over 15
   billion page views, Chrome took 32.43% of the worldwide market compared
   to 32.12% for IE and 25.55% for Firefox. StatCounter says that a battle
   royal has broken out between Chrome, IE and Firefox. &#8220;While
   attention has recently been focused on the battle between Chrome and
   IE, not-for-profit Mozilla's Firefox with its loyal membership base
   should not be underestimated,&#8221; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. He points out that an upswing of over 0.6% in Firefox
   usage from April to May 2012 (apparently at the expense of IE) helped
   to push Chrome into pole position.&#8220;The browser wars are back with
   a vengeance,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This time there are three major
   players competing for the top spot but, ultimately, the real winner
   will be the end user who can look forward to more choice and innovation
   as a result of this increased competition.&#8221; In a stunning display
   of growth, Chrome has gone from zero to market leader on a worldwide
   basis in less than four years. That said, while IE has ceded the top
   spot to Chrome for May 2012, Microsoft's newest browser version (IE9)
   is performing well and Firefox is holding its own. In the US, IE
   remains the dominant browser. IE is similarly dominant in the UK.
   StatCounter Global Stats has recently launched a new map feature which
   clearly illustrates the increasing global usage of Chrome. The increase
   is particularly evident when mapped data from May 2011 and May 2012 is
   compared  both IE and Firefox cede a significant number of countries to
   Chrome over the period. Ends Press queries For interview with Aodhan

   sers-at-weekends Web analytics firm research suggests acceptance of IE9
   by home users Boston, USA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Tuesday, 8th May 2012:
   Microsoft's latest browser IE9 is performing strongly at the weekend
   according to StatCounter, the independent website analytics company.
   The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that, while
   total IE usage dips, IE9 usage peaks at weekends. Commenting, Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter said, "We have previously noted that Google's
   Chrome peaks at the weekend at the expense of IE. This seems to suggest
   that many home (as opposed to business) users prefer Chrome to IE.
   However, having drilled down further into our data, we have released a
   new statistic which allows the comparison of Chrome (all versions
   combined)* with the individual versions of other browsers. This shows
   that while IE6, 7 and 8 usage falls off at the weekend, IE9 spikes.
   This indicates that IE9 is bucking the trend of previous IE versions
   and is gaining home user traction." The weekend trend towards both
   Chrome and IE9 peaking is repeated across US and UK users. StatCounter
   data is based on over 15 billion page views per month (4 billion from
   the US; 850 million from the UK) to the StatCounter network of more
   than three million websites. Apart from its research arm, StatCounter

   ers Web analytics firm reports that 1366x768 overtakes 1024x768 for
   first timeBoston, USA and Dublin, Ireland, Wednesday, 11th April, 2012:
   A major milestone in screen resolution sizes has been passed according
   to independent web analytics company, StatCounter. The company's
   research arm, StatCounter Global Stats reports that for the first time
   1366x768 has become the most popular screen resolution worldwide,
   having overtaken 1024x768. "The data reflects a continuing trend of
   users moving to larger screen resolution sizes," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The screen resolution size people are using
   is a critical factor for developers when it comes to web design,
   particularly in the case of fixed width web pages." Since StatCounter
   began its tracking of screen resolution in March 2009, as a free
   service to developers and other users, 1024x768 has been the dominant
   screen size globally on the web (excluding mobile*). 1024x768 has
   fallen from 41.8% in March 2009 to 18.6% in March 2012. Over the same
   period 1366x768 has grown from 0.68% to 19.28%.The third most popular
   size is 1280x800 at 13%. Cullen also said that while StatCounter Global
   Stats provides information on worldwide and regional trends, monitoring
   the specific screen resolutions being used to view individual sites is
   also very important. StatCounter (http://statcounter.com/) provides
   free website traffic analysis. This allows web developers to capture
   screen resolution stats on their own and on their client websites in
   real time. Other information available includes search terms, download
   stats, exit links and other data. StatCounter Global Stats data is

   this is a milestone," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. He
   added that Chrome still faces a battle to unseat its main rivals

   can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be

   of them are selecting Chrome in preference to IE," added Aodhan Cullen,

   Global Stats highlights the increasing use of mobile devices to access

   15th December, 2011: Google's Chrome 15 has become the most popular web
   browser version worldwide for the first time on a weekly basis,
   according to StatCounter, the free website analytics company. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that in the last
   full week in November, Chrome 15 took 23.6% of the worldwide market
   compared to Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 at 23.5%. If one aggregates
   all versions then IE still leads the global market with Chrome in
   second position, having overtaken Firefox in November. "Google
   announced Chrome for business exactly a year ago and IT administrators
   appear to have embraced it in a remarkably short time," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Looking at the daily stats, Chrome 14
   and 15 have been overtaking IE8 at weekends since the beginning of
   October. However, Chrome 15 overtook IE8 for the first time during the
   five day working week, in week commencing 5th December. It looks as if
   people favour Chrome on weekends at home but office commercial use has
   now caught up." In the US Internet Explorer 8 continues to be the most
   popular browser version with 27.0% for week commencing 5th December
   compared to 18.1% for Chrome 15. However, in the UK Chrome 15 overtook
   IE8 in the week commencing November 7th. Last week (commencing 5th
   December) Chrome 15 had 24.7% in the UK compared to IE8 on 21.1%.

   7Boston, USA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Tuesday, 1st November 2011:
   Microsoft's operating system Windows 7 overtook its 10 year old sibling
   XP globally for the first time in October, according to StatCounter,
   the free website analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that in October Windows 7 took 40.5% of global web
   market share with XP at 38.5%. Windows Vista, which was intended to
   replace XP, is down at 11.2% globally. "Vista was like the ugly sister
   that few wanted to dance with," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Despite Microsoft trying to keep it back in the kitchen,
   XP has retained tremendous loyalty over the last decade. However, it
   looks like the younger Windows 7 is now emerging in the Cinderella
   role." The StatCounter analysis finds that Windows 7 overtook XP in the
   United States in April of this year and in Europe in July. However, in
   Asia Windows XP still retains a clear lead at 55% in October compared
   to 36% for Windows 7. Vista in Asia is at 5%. StatCounter Global Stats
   are based on aggregate data collected on a sample of over 15 billion
   page views per month (4 billion in the US) from the StatCounter network
   of more than three million websites. As well as free web research,
   StatCounter (http://statcounter.com/) provides free website traffic
   analysis. This allows website owners, developers and bloggers to

   is on an upward trajectory," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "This is particularly impressive as a Firefox upgrade has to be

   Wednesday, 23rd March 2011: Mozilla Firefox 4, which was launched
   yesterday (Tuesday 22nd March), has already taken 1.95% of the
   worldwide Internet browser market according to StatCounter, the free
   website analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global
   Stats reports that on the first day of its release Firefox 4 scored
   higher globally than Microsoft's new Internet Explorer 9 which was
   launched more than a week ago.* "Firefox 4 has really hit the ground
   running and has eclipsed the launch of IE 9," commented Aodhan Cullen,
   CEO, StatCounter. "Although IE 9 has undoubtedly been hampered by its
   lack of compatibility with Windows XP." By yesterday IE 9 had taken
   just 0.87% of the worldwide market. When all versions of each browser
   are taken in to account, Internet Explorer still leads the global
   market with 45% followed by Firefox with 30% and Chrome with 17%. In
   the US, IE (all versions combined) leads the market with 48% followed
   by Firefox on 26% and Chrome on 14%. On a monthly basis, StatCounter
   figures show a steady decline in the IE global market share from 55% in
   February last year to 45% this year. In the same time frame Google's
   Chrome has risen steadily from 7% worldwide to 17%. StatCounter
   recently reported that Firefox overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer
   (IE) to become the number one browser in Europe for the first time in
   December 2010. StatCounter Global Stats are based on aggregate data
   collected on a sample exceeding 15 billion page views per month (4

   Bing search engine overtook Yahoo! for the first time worldwide in
   January and increased its lead in February according to web analytics
   company, StatCounter. Its research arm StatCounter Global Stats finds
   that globally Bing reached 4.37% in February ahead of Yahoo! at 3.93%.
   Both trail far behind Google's 89.94% of the global search engine
   market. In the United States Yahoo! at 9.74% still retains its lead
   over Bing at 9.03%. Google's share in the US is 79.63%. In July 2009
   Microsoft announced an agreement whereby Bing would power the Yahoo!
   search technology. This has been implemented in the US, Canada,
   Australia, Brazil and Mexico. "It is significant that Bing overtook
   Yahoo! globally for the first time on a monthly basis but it remains a
   tough battle to claw back Google's market share," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Although Google dipped below the 90% mark in

   has been dethroned from the number one spot in a major territory,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "This appears to be

   Explorer while Firefox is mainly maintaining its existing share."
   Google Chrome in third place is gaining market share in Europe and has

   rs Google's Android Gaining Market ShareBoston, USA and Dublin,
   Ireland; Wednesday 1st December, 2010: BlackBerry OS overtook Apple's
   iOS for the first time in the US in November in terms of mobile
   internet usage according to web analytics company, StatCounter. The
   company's research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that for the
   first time in the US BlackBerry OS at 34.3% overtook Apple's iOS which
   recorded 33% in November. Google's Android is rapidly gaining and has
   almost tripled internet market share from 8.2% last November to 23.8%
   this year. Apple's iOS has fallen from 51.9% to 33% over the same
   period. "These figures suggest that developers should not be developing
   solely for the iPhone to the exclusion of BlackBerry and Android,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. He added that, if current
   trends continue, BlackBerry and Android combined are on course to
   become twice the size of iOS as regards mobile internet usage in the
   next year. Commenting on Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 he said that
   it was not yet registering significantly in terms of internet usage but
   would be interesting to observe over the next year. "This data
   demonstrates that there is a battle royal already going on in the
   smartphone market for the consumer and business internet user. You can
   never underestimate Microsoft but it looks to have its work cut out."
   BlackBerry's US lead is not replicated in terms of worldwide share
   according to the StatCounter data. Globally Symbian OS leads with 31.9%
   followed by iOS (21.9%), BlackBerry OS (19.3%) and Android (11.6%).

   Share</h3><p><strong>Boston, USA and Dublin, Ireland; Wednesday 1st
   December, 2010:</strong> BlackBerry OS overtook Apple's iOS for the
   first time in the US in November in terms of mobile internet usage
   according to <a href="http://statcounter.com/">web analytics company,
   StatCounter</a>. The company's research arm, <a
   href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_os-US-monthly-200911-201011">St
   atCounter Global Stats</a> finds that for the first time in the US
   BlackBerry OS at 34.3% overtook Apple's iOS which recorded 33% in
   November. </p> <p>Google's Android is rapidly gaining and has almost
   tripled internet market share from 8.2% last November to 23.8% this
   year. Apple's iOS has fallen from 51.9% to 33% over the same
   period.</p> <p>"These figures suggest that developers should not be
   developing solely for the iPhone to the exclusion of BlackBerry and
   Android," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. He added that, if
   current trends continue, BlackBerry and Android combined are on course
   to become twice the size of iOS as regards mobile internet usage in the
   next year.</p> <p>Commenting on Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 he said
   that it was not yet registering significantly in terms of internet
   usage but would be interesting to observe over the next year. "This
   data demonstrates that there is a battle royal already going on in the
   smartphone market for the consumer and business internet user. You can
   never underestimate Microsoft but it looks to have its work cut
   out."</p> <p>BlackBerry's US lead is not replicated in terms of
   worldwide share according to the StatCounter data. Globally Symbian OS
   leads with 31.9% followed by iOS (21.9%), BlackBerry OS (19.3%) and
   Android (11.6%).<p> <p>StatCounter Global Stats are based on aggregate

   Explorer (IE) browser has fallen below 50% of the worldwide market for
   the first time according to StatCounter. The company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that Microsoft IE fell to 49.87% in
   September followed by Firefox with 31.5%. Google's Chrome continues to
   increase market share at an impressive rate and has more than tripled
   from 3.69% in September 2009 to 11.54% in September this year. "This is
   certainly a milestone in the Internet browser wars," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Just two years ago IE dominated the
   worldwide market with 67%." He added that Microsoft's agreement with
   European Commission competition authorities to offer EU users a choice
   and menu of browsers from March may have tipped IE below 50% globally.
   In Europe, IE market share has fallen to 40.26% in September this year
   from 46.44% in September last year. In North America IE is still above
   50% at 52.3% followed by Firefox at 27.21% and Chrome at 9.87%. The

   StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports

   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter commented, "Africa, Asia and South

   there has been extremely good growth for Windows 7 in Europe and North
   America, it has yet to overtake Vista in these regions." Vista

   the gap is even closer with 22.7% for Vista compared to 21.9% for

   2010: Usage of web browser Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) in the US and
   Europe fell below the 5% mark for the first time in May, according to
   web analytics company, StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that IE6 US usage has fallen to 4.7% from 11.5% 12
   months ago. "At these levels web developers now have valid
   justification not to support IE6 in the future," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. A number of sites including YouTube are
   already understood to have withdrawn support for IE6. StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that IE8 US usage increased to 30.5% in May from
   8.5% in the same month last year. IE7 is currently at 16.6% in the US.
   "IE6 has been a bit of a pain for many web developers and designers who
   have often had to recode their site to get it to work. There are also
   security implications in its continued usage," added Aodhan Cullen of
   StatCounter. However, globally he suggested that web designers were not
   out of the woods yet. "If your target market is Asia then IE6 still has
   20.8% usage. IE8 has only just overtaken it in Asia." Africa also
   continues to have high levels of usage of IE6. The data is based on an
   analysis of 15 billion page views (3.8 billion from the US and 4.3
   billion from Europe) for May 2010 collected from the StatCounter
   network of over three million websites. Ends Press queries to: Kerri

   Twitter generates almost one in ten Social Media global hits to
   websites according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The firm's
   research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that Facebook is the
   primary source of traffic to global websites with almost half (48%) of
   Social Media hits followed by StumbleUpon with almost a quarter (25%).
   The data for March is based on 13 billion page views across the global
   StatCounter network of member sites. StatCounter, which provides free
   website traffic information, has recently added Social Media to its
   StatCounter Global Stats, a free online research tool for media,
   analysts, bloggers, researchers and members. StatCounter Global Stats
   monitors Internet market share battles including Search Engines,
   Browsers, Operating Systems including mobile and now Social Media.
   "From a business perspective the findings suggest that there is merit
   in having a corporate Facebook page or Twitter account ," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The surprise packet is StumbleUpon,
   which over the past year has been consistently in the top two Social
   Media sites in terms of generating global website traffic. Indeed, in
   the US in March StumbleUpon was number one ahead of Facebook in terms
   of website traffic generation." The top Social Media sites to generate
   global website traffic after Facebook, StumbleUpon and Twitter are
   YouTube (6%), reddit (4%), Digg (2%) and MySpace (2%). Mr Cullen added,
   "Social Media market share fluctuates a lot more than browser or search
   statistics. For example, Facebook peaked over Christmas and the New
   Year with almost three quarters of the total, perhaps reflecting its
   important role in communications between families and friends." He also
   noted that professional Social Media site LinkedIn was ranked at 12
   with 0.34%. "This does not reflect its importance as a business site as
   it is not directly comparable to the more consumer focused sites." Ends

   has been closing the gap on Chinese search engine leader Baidu over the
   last six months according to web analytics company StatCounter. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that at the end of
   2009 Baidu held 56% of the Chinese market compared to Google's 43%.
   "Google has made impressive gains in China since July last when it was
   at 30% compared to Baidu's 68%," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Our analysis suggests that given Google's recent strong
   performance, market share is certainly not the reason behind its threat
   to leave China at this time." At the end of 2009 Yahoo! and Bing's
   combined share of the Chinese search market stood at just 1.18%.
   Despite significant gains in China in the last six months, Google's
   market share there still lags its global penetration where it has over
   90% of the market. The analysis is based on 24 million search engine
   referring clicks from China which were collected between July and
   December 2009. Ends Press queries to: Kerri Crowley, Simpson Financial

   Tuesday, 3rd November 2009: Windows 7 has had an encouraging start in
   the US and globally according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that Windows 7
   weekly share went from 1.75% of the US market pre launch to 2.82% by
   the end of October. Globally too the news was positive for Microsoft
   with market share increasing to the same levels. "Windows 7 has hit the
   ground running and the underlying trend is positive for Microsoft,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The new operating system
   should be further boosted by December holiday season sales of computers
   which will have Windows 7 preinstalled." He added that as expected it
   looks as if Windows 7 is taking market share from Vista and to a lesser
   extent XP. "In the US Vista has declined from 35.78% to 34.52% at the
   end of October. XP has seen a smaller fall from 48.92% to 48.47%." He
   added that one factor is clear from the analysis. "Apple Mac fans
   remain unimpressed by the global launch hype. Mac OS X grew over the
   same period in the US from 11.29% to 11.87%." Data is based on an
   analysis of 4.7 billion page views (1.1 billion from the US) which were
   collected during the three week period 12th October to the 1st November
   2009 from the StatCounter network of over three million websites.

   (US); Dublin (Ireland): Monday, 2nd November 2009: Microsoft's search
   engine Bing recovered market share slightly in the US in October
   according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The firm's research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that Bing took 8.86% in October, up from
   8.51% in September but below its peak of 9.64% in August. StatCounter
   says that Yahoo! continues to lose market share, down to 8.91% in
   October from 9.4% in September and 10.5% in August. Google took 80.39%
   of the US market, its largest share since November '08. "Bing's market
   share has stabilised after falling since mid August," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "However, a worrying trend for Microsoft is
   that the combined Bing and Yahoo! market share has seen a steady
   decline from 20.36% in July to 17.77% in October." Globally, Bing and
   Yahoo! combined took 7.4% of the market compared to 90.81% for Google.
   Data is based on an analysis of 5.1 billion search engine referring
   clicks (1.27 billion from the US) which were collected during the
   period October 2008 to October 2009 from the StatCounter network of
   over three million websites. StatCounter, which provides free website

   <h3>Google Hits Highest US Share for Almost a
   Year</h3><p><strong>Boston (US); Dublin (Ireland): Monday, 2nd November
   2009:</strong> Microsoft's search engine Bing recovered market share
   slightly in the US in October according to <a
   href="http://www.statcounter.com/">web analytics firm, StatCounter</a>.
   The firm's research arm <a
   href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#search_engine-US-monthly-200811-200910
   ">StatCounter Global Stats</a> finds that Bing took 8.86% in October,
   up from 8.51% in September but below its peak of 9.64% in August.</p>
   <p>StatCounter says that Yahoo! continues to lose market share, down to
   8.91% in October from 9.4% in September and 10.5% in August. Google
   took 80.39% of the US market, its largest share since November '08.</p>
   <p>"Bing's market share has stabilised after falling since mid August,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "However, a worrying trend
   for Microsoft is that the combined Bing and Yahoo! market share has
   seen a steady decline from 20.36% in July to 17.77% in October."</p>
   <p>Globally, Bing and Yahoo! combined took 7.4% of the market compared
   to 90.81% for Google.</p> <p>Data is based on an analysis of 5.1
   billion search engine referring clicks (1.27 billion from the US) which
   were collected during the period October 2008 to October 2009 from the
   StatCounter network of over three million websites.</p> <p>StatCounter,

   e-launch Boston (US); Dublin (Ireland): Thursday, 1st October, 2009:
   Bing's monthly market share in the US and globally has fallen for the
   first time since its launch, according to analysis conducted by web
   analytics firm StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global
   Stats finds that Bing's share of the US search market in September fell
   by over one percentage point to 8.51% from 9.64% in August. There was
   little consolation for Microsoft from the performance of its new
   partner, Yahoo! which also declined, to 9.40% from 10.50%. "The trend
   has been downwards for Bing since mid August," commented Aodhan Cullen,
   CEO, StatCounter. "The wheels haven't fallen off but the underlying
   trend must be a little worrying for Microsoft." Google was the
   beneficiary from the decline of its main rival, increasing by more than
   two percentage points to 80.08% in September from 77.83% the previous
   month. Globally, Bing also declined slightly to 3.25% from 3.58% - a
   trend mirrored by Yahoo! which fell to 4.37% from 4.84%. Google
   breached the 90% mark to 90.54% - similar to its global market share a
   year previously (90.53%). Data is based on an analysis of 4.6 billion
   search engine referring clicks (1.1 billion from the US) which were
   collected during the period September 2008 to September 2009 from the
   StatCounter network of over three million websites. StatCounter, which

   August, 2009: Bing again slightly increased the Microsoft share of the
   US search market in July to 9.41% from 8.23% in June according to
   analysis conducted by web analytics firm StatCounter. The firm's
   research arm StatCounter Global Stats finds that Microsoft and Yahoo!

   Google still commands the US market with 77.54% in July (78.48% in
   June). "Bing continues to make slow but steady progress but the
   combined Yahoo! figures suggests that the deal announced last week will
   have to demonstrate major future synergies if it is to make any dent in

   the global market according to StatCounter analysis. Microsoft and

   Google still dominates search engine market wars Dublin (Ireland):
   Friday, 10th July, 2009: For the second time since it was launched,
   Microsoft's Bing search engine overtook Yahoo! Thursday (9th July) in
   US usage according to analysis conducted by web analytics firm
   StatCounter. Bing took 12.9% of the US market ahead of Yahoo!'s 10.15%
   but still well behind market leader Google at 74.99% according to the
   company's research arm StatCounter Global Stats. See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#search_engine-US-daily-20090601-20090709 The
   last time Bing overtook Yahoo! on one day was shortly after launch on
   June 4th according to StatCounter. "The jump in Bing's share may
   reflect a positive review of the search engine compared to Google which
   appeared online in the New York Times on the 8th and in the print
   version on the 9th July," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "While its lead over Yahoo! may not last into next week our data
   suggests that it is slowly but surely closing the gap." StatCounter
   earlier this month announced June figures which showed that Microsoft
   had 8.23% market share in the US behind Yahoo! at 11.04% with Google at
   78.48%. This research was based on an analysis of 1.316 billion search
   engine referring clicks (336 million from the US) which were collected
   from the StatCounter network of over three million websites.

   York (US) and Dublin (Ireland); Friday, 5th June, 2009: Microsoft's
   Bing overtook Yahoo! as the number two search engine in the United
   States and worldwide Thursday (4th June) according to data from
   StatCounter Global Stats. StatCounter says that Bing grabbed market
   share from Google. "It remains to be seen if Bing falls away after the
   initial novelty and promotion but at first sight it looks like
   Microsoft is on to a winner," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Steve Ballmer is quoted as saying that he wanted
   Microsoft to become the second biggest search engine within five years.
   Following the breakdown in talks to acquire Yahoo! at a cost of $40bn
   it looks as if he may have just achieved that with Bing much sooner and
   a lot cheaper than anticipated." StatCounter's analysis for Thursday
   finds that in the US Bing leapfrogged Yahoo to take second place on
   16.28%. Yahoo! has 10.22%. Google still commands the US search engine
   market with 71.47%. StatCounter data globally finds that Bing at 5.62%
   has taken a narrow lead over Yahoo! (5.13%). Google worldwide retains

   last week, overtaking Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 for the first
   time on a weekly basis according to web analytics firm StatCounter
   (http://gs.statcounter.com). Firefox 3.0 took 35.05% of the European

   http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-eu-weekly-200904-200913).
   "The move is partly explained by a small switch from IE 7.0 usage to IE
   8.0 but also by growing market share overall by Firefox 3.0," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder StatCounter. "The data shows that
   Firefox is closing the gap and is now just 10% behind all IE versions

   system market in the United States according to research by StatCounter
   which provides free website traffic statistics. (See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-US-weekly-200903-200912). "Based on daily
   data Windows Vista has only topped 30% a few times before and only for
   a maximum of three days running. This is the first time it has broken
   through 30% on a weekly basis suggesting that it is gaining some
   consistent traction in the US," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and
   founder, StatCounter. However, he said that the data suggested that
   there was still resistance to Vista in the business market. "The data
   illustrates clearly that Vista peaks at the weekends while XP peaks
   during week days." (See:

   that Mac OS X is gaining market share. Its share of the operating

   share http://gs.statcounter.com/press/microsoft-ie8-launch-underwhelms
   New York and Dublin, Friday, March 20, 2009: There has been limited
   take up to date of Microsoft's new Internet Explorer 8 according to
   research by StatCounter which provides free website traffic statistics.
   According to StatCounter Global Stats global usage in the first day of
   launch (March 19) was 1.39%. This is just above its previous day's
   market penetration of 1.33%. The new browser has been in public beta
   testing for about a year. By 20th March 17:00 GMT IE 8 market share had
   risen to 1.56%. "I suppose the kindest description of user reaction to
   IE 8's first public outing would be 'underwhelming'," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO and founder of StatCounter. He contrasted the performance
   to the launch of Firefox 3 last June. "Firefox 3 managed to convert
   users from its previous browser. Usage of Firefox 3 more than doubled
   from 7.8% at beta testing to 18.9% over a three day period following
   the launch (June 16-18)." StatCounter is one of the largest website
   traffic monitoring companies in the world with over two million members
   globally. Over 40% are located in the US with 25% in Europe. Its
   analysis is based on four billion pageloads per month. To follow how IE

   2009: Mozilla Firefox 3 overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 for
   the first time in February in the Internet browser wars according to
   monthly data from StatCounter Global Stats (http://gs.statcounter.com)
   - the new free analysis tool. Internet Explorer 7 continues to lead
   globally with 41% market share. However, Firefox 3 is now in second
   place with 24% replacing IE 6. "Since its launch less than a year ago,
   Firefox 3 has attained nearly one quarter of the global market,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder, StatCounter. "IE 7 is
   consistently holding about 40% of the global market but IE 6 has fallen
   from 28% in July last to 22% in February this year."* The growth in
   usage of Firefox 3 can be partly attributed to users upgrading to the
   new version - Firefox 2 market share has fallen from 16% to 3% in the
   period. Microsoft's combined IE 7 and IE 6 market share has fallen from
   68% in July last year to 63% now. IE 8 has gained a toehold in the
   market of just over 1%. Firefox 3 and 2 has grown from 25% in July last
   to 27% in February '09. "The overall trend is what is interesting
   here," added Aodhan Cullen. The StatCounter analysis is based on four
   billion pageloads per month. StatCounter is one of the largest website
   traffic monitoring companies in the world with over two million members
   globally. Over 40% are located in the US with 25% in Europe. ends *

   ngine-cuil-is-one-to-watch Thursday, 31st July, 2008: Research by Irish
   company Statcounter, which provides free web site traffic statistics,
   shows that Cuil, the new search engine launched on Monday could be a
   significant rival to Google. After just one day, Cuil accounted for 1
   in every 1000 searches done. Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder of
   StatCounter said, "This is phenomenal when you consider that Altavista,
   a search engine founded in 1995, accounted for just 6 in 10,000
   searches." Cullen continued, "There are over 100 search engines we
   monitor and Cuil was in the top ten in US, UK and Ireland. When you
   consider that over 90 other search engines (e.g. go, excite,
   alltheweb.com, lycos) combined accounted for just 1.54% of searches on
   Tuesday - Cuil with its 0.1% share on the market inside 24 hours is
   doing extremely well." On Tuesday Cuil accounted for 1 in 1,000
   searches globally and in the US. 1 in 500 searches in the UK and 1 in
   every 400 searches in Ireland.* *Note: This information is based on a

   <p><strong>Thursday, 31st July, 2008</strong>: Research by Irish
   company Statcounter, which provides free web site traffic statistics,
   shows that Cuil, the new search engine launched on Monday could be a
   significant rival to Google. After just one day, Cuil accounted for 1
   in every 1000 searches done.</p> <p>Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder of
   StatCounter said, "This is phenomenal when you consider that Altavista,
   a search engine founded in 1995, accounted for just 6 in 10,000
   searches."</p> <p>Cullen continued, "There are over 100 search engines
   we monitor and Cuil was in the top ten in US, UK and Ireland. When you
   consider that over 90 other search engines (e.g. go, excite,
   alltheweb.com, lycos) combined accounted for just 1.54% of searches on
   Tuesday - Cuil with its 0.1% share on the market inside 24 hours is
   doing extremely well."</p> <p>On Tuesday Cuil accounted for 1 in 1,000
   searches globally and in the US. 1 in 500 searches in the UK and 1 in
   every 400 searches in Ireland.*</p> <p>*Note: This information is based

   -browser-wars - StatCounter research finds iPhone is number one mobile
   browser in US number two globally - MS Internet Explorer faces close
   competition from open source Firefox Tuesday, 18th March 2008: Apple
   has increased its share of the Internet browser market in the US by 64%
   between December and March according to StatCounter, which provides
   organisations and individuals with a free website visitor statistics
   tool.* Globally iPhone/iTouch has more than doubled its share of the
   Internet browser market from 0.03% to 0.08%. In March iPhone and iTouch
   increased their share of the total browser market in the US from 0.14%
   in December to 0.23% according to StatCounter which tracks in excess of
   nine billion pageloads per month over its network of two million
   websites. If one excludes iTouch from the figures then iPhone's market
   share of Internet browsing in the US (0.18%) is still well ahead of
   Nokia (0.01%). However, Nokia still maintains a significant lead over
   Apple in the global market with 0.25% to 0.08%. "The key message is
   that iPhone is more than living up to its claims of being a user
   friendly Internet browser, unlike many other mobile phones," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, founder and CEO of StatCounter. He said that iPhone web
   browsing peaked in the US on Christmas Day at 0.07%. "Presumably this
   was due to people trying out their new Christmas present combined
   perhaps with not accessing PCs that day." The StatCounter analysis
   finds that Microsoft Internet Explorer still leads the browser market
   overall with 44.5% market share in the US. But it is facing real
   competition from open source based Firefox which grew to 43.9% of the
   US browser market. Globally Internet Explorer is well ahead at 59% with
   Firefox on 33%. The StatCounter analysis was based on a sample of 372
   million page views globally from December 07 to March 08, including 71

   e &ldquo;Milestone in technology history and end of an era&rdquo; as
   Microsoft no longer owns dominant OS Android now world&rsquo;s most
   popular operating system in terms of internet usage San Francisco, CA
   and Dublin, Ireland; 3rd April, 2017: Google&rsquo;s Android has
   overtaken Microsoft Windows for the first time as the world&rsquo;s
   most popular operating system (OS) in terms of total internet usage
   across desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile combined. The research arm of
   StatCounter, the independent web analytics company, finds that in
   March, Android topped the worldwide OS internet usage market share with
   37.93%, which puts it marginally ahead of Windows&nbsp; (37.91%) for
   the first time. &ldquo;This is a milestone in technology history and
   the end of an era,&rdquo; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   &nbsp;&ldquo;It marks the end of Microsoft&rsquo;s leadership worldwide
   of the OS market which it has held since the 1980s. &nbsp;It also
   represents a major breakthrough for Android which held just 2.4% of
   global internet usage share only five years ago.&rdquo; Cullen said
   that main drivers of the breakthrough were growth of smartphones to
   access the internet, a decline in sales of traditional PCs and the
   impact of Asia on the global market. However, Windows still dominates
   the worldwide operating system desktop market (PC and laptop) with a
   84% internet usage share in March. &ldquo;Windows won the desktop war
   but the battlefield moved on,&rdquo; said Cullen. &quot;It will be
   difficult for Microsoft to make inroads in mobile but the next paradigm
   shift might give it the opportunity to regain dominance. That could be
   in Augmented Reality, AI, Voice or Continuum (a product that aims to
   replace &nbsp;a desktop and smartphone with a single Microsoft powered
   phone).&quot; In North America Windows (all versions) maintained its
   lead across all platforms with 39.5% share in March followed by iOS
   (25.7%) and Android (21.2%). It&rsquo;s a similar story in Europe where
   Windows (51.7%) is more than twice the level of Android (23.6%).
   However, in Asia, Android is on 52.2% compared to 29.2% for Windows. OS

   of UK or US India number one in G20 for mobile Mumbai, India &amp;
   Dublin, Ireland;&nbsp; 28th March 2017: Indians are amongst the world
   leaders in terms of internet usage from mobile phones, according to
   StatCounter, the independent web analytics company. Its research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that 79% of internet usage was made by
   Indians through mobiles in February compared to 49.7% for the world in
   general. Indian mobile usage to surf the internet is more than double
   that in the UK (34.8%) or US (37.2%). Of G20 nations, India is the
   number one user of mobile in terms of internet usage. StatCounter is
   one of the leading web analytics firms in the world with a considerable
   market share in India. StatCounter&rsquo;s (http://statcounter.com)
   core business is to provide members with data to measure visitor
   activity on their website, blog or forum. Key features include a free
   option, ease of use, independence and ability to view data in real
   time. &ldquo;Our research confirms that Indians adore their mobiles for
   surfing the internet,&rdquo; commented Tarak Desai of StatCounter in
   Mumbai. &nbsp;&ldquo;Internet usage by mobile in India is striking
   compared to most other countries.&rdquo; He added that the trend was
   accelerating. &ldquo;Internet usage in India by desktop and tablet fell
   from 33.2% in January 2016 to 21% this year. Mobile jumped from 66.8%
   to 79% over the same time period.&rdquo; Desai said that the move by
   new player Reliance JIO with over a 100 million subscribers to offer
   free 4G data (1GB per day limit) over the last six months until April
   1st was probably one but not the only reason for the acceleration in
   mobile internet usage in India. Chart:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/i
   ndia/#monthly-201601-201702 The most popular browser in India in terms
   of internet usage according to StatCounter is UC Browser (43.3%)
   followed by Chrome (36.1%). This compares to worldwide, where Chrome
   (52.4%) leads the way followed by Safari (14.4%). Reflecting the strong
   mobile preference, the top operating system in India across all
   platforms is Android on 62% followed by Windows (19.4%). Worldwide,
   Windows leads on 38.6% followed by Android (37.4%) and iOS (13%). When
   it comes to search, however, Indians behave similarly to the rest of
   the world. Google on 93.4% is the dominant player in India, little
   different to worldwide (92.4%) or UK (91.1%). To analyse further how

   war but battlefield has moved on&rdquo; San Francisco, CA and Dublin,
   Ireland; 7th March, 2017: In what StatCounter describes as
   &ldquo;unthinkable five years ago&rdquo;, Google&rsquo;s Android is
   challenging Microsoft Windows as the world&rsquo;s most popular
   operating system (OS) in terms of total internet usage across desktop,
   laptop, tablet and mobile combined. The research arm of StatCounter,
   the independent web analytics company, finds that in February 2017,
   while Windows remained top of worldwide OS internet usage market share
   with 38.6%, Android came within striking distance on 37.4%. &ldquo;The
   idea of Android almost matching Windows would have been unthinkable
   five years ago,&rdquo; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   &nbsp;&ldquo;In January 2012 Windows held 82% global internet usage
   share compared to just 2.2% for Android.&rdquo; He said that the
   development was a function of the growth of smartphones to access the
   internet as well as a slowdown in sales of traditional PCs plus the
   impact of Asia on the global market. Windows still dominates the
   worldwide operating system desktop market (PC and laptop) with a 84.1%
   internet usage share in February. &ldquo;Windows has won the desktop
   war but the battlefield has moved on,&rdquo; said Cullen. StatCounter
   recently reported that in October 2016 internet usage by mobile and
   tablet devices exceeded desktop and laptop worldwide for the first
   time. In North America Windows (all versions) maintained its lead
   across all platforms with 40.7% share in February followed by iOS
   (24.9%) and Android (20.3%). It&rsquo;s a similar story in Europe where
   Windows (51.8%) is more than twice the level of Android (23.5%).
   However, in Asia, Android is now over 50% (51.8%) compared to 29.8% for
   Windows. OS market share map:

   StatCounter data also finds that Windows 10 overtook Windows 7 for the
   first time in North America in December. &ldquo;Windows 10 will need to
   maintain momentum in order to combat the steady march of Android across
   all markets,&rdquo; added Aodhan Cullen. The data is based on
   StatCounter Global Stats for which the company has recently released a
   major upgrade. This provides media, researchers, analysts and
   interested consumers with a free service to help analyse internet wars
   as the major vendors battle for dominance across operating systems,
   search, browsers, desktop and mobile. StatCounter (www.statcounter.com)
   has also launched an upgrade of its core website which provides web
   analytics, including a free option, to help companies, agencies,
   bloggers, self-employed and charities measure, analyse and understand
   visitors to their own sites. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always focused on ease
   of use and with these upgrades we wanted to make both services even
   more intuitive, usable and accessible,&rdquo; commented Aodhan Cullen.

   Monday, 1st February 2016: Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system
   overtook 8.1 for the first time globally in January, according to
   independent web analytics company StatCounter. Its analytics arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that Windows 10 hit 13.7% in terms of
   desktop internet usage compared to 11.7% for Windows 8.1. Microsoft's
   latest operating system is still some way behind Windows 7 which
   represented 46.7% of internet usage worldwide in January. Graph:

   still leads the US on 40.5%. In the UK Windows 10 is powering ahead
   with 22.4% in January compared to 12.5% for 8.1. Win 10 overtook 8.1 in
   October. Windows 7 represents 36.8% of internet usage in the UK.
   "Microsoft's determined promotion of Windows 10 seems to be having an
   impact," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "However, there
   remains a lot of loyalty to Windows 7 and it will be interesting to see
   if it becomes the equivalent of XP which, 14 years after launch,
   refuses to lie down and still has a 8% global share in terms of desktop
   internet use." StatCounter analysis of the first six months finds that
   Windows 10 usage is greater than Windows 8 and Windows 7 over the same
   time period globally, in the US and UK. Worldwide usage of Windows 10
   after six calendar months (since August) was 13.7% compared to 5.0% for

   difficulty in challenging Google's search share in US and
   worldwideAnalysis follows Yahoo announcement of reverse spin off San
   Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Wednesday, 9th December 2015:
   Yahoo's share of search referrals in the US fell from 7.6% in July
   2012, when Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO, to 7.4% last
   month (November), according to data from independent website analytics
   provider, StatCounter. The analysis comes following Yahoo's
   announcement Wednesday of a reverse spin off plan. StatCounter's
   research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that Yahoo's US share fell
   by 2.6% since July 2012. (Note: analysis covers all platforms including
   desktop, mobile, tablet and console). Yahoo peaked in the US at 10.2%
   in January 2015 after Mozilla made it the default search engine for
   Firefox 34 users. Between July 2012 and November 2015 Bing also fell,
   from 8.25% to 7.82% in the US, a loss of 5.2%. Google increased its US
   share by 1.3% from 82.4% to 83.5%. US graph:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-search_engine-US-monthly-201207-201511
   "Despite Bing's integration with Windows 10 and Yahoo's partnership
   with Firefox* it is proving difficult for anyone to challenge Google's
   lead in search share," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. This
   is borne out by Google's worldwide search share. StatCounter reports
   that in November 2015 Google held 91.5%, little changed from 91.75% in
   July 2012. Worldwide Yahoo is at 2.96% compared to 2.86% at the time of
   Marissa Mayer's appointment. During the same time, Bing fell from 2.96%

   sage http://gs.statcounter.com/press/yahoo-growth-stalls San Francisco,
   CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 2nd March 2015: Yahoo's recent growth
   in US search share came to a halt in February but it has largely
   maintained the gains it made over January and December, according to
   data from independent website analytics provider, StatCounter.
   StatCounter Global Stats reports that in February, Google took 74.9% of
   US search referrals followed by Bing on 12.5% and Yahoo on 10.7%, down
   marginally from 10.9% the previous month. "While Yahoo's search growth
   from the Mozilla deal has stalled, its share declined only slightly in
   February," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "It will be
   interesting to see if January was the month of peak impact for Yahoo as
   a result of the Mozilla deal and whether it can maintain its gains over
   the next few months." StatCounter separately analysed search share by
   US Firefox users only. It found that in February for the US
   Google-on-Firefox was at 65.1% (up from 63.9% in January);
   Yahoo-on-Firefox usage was at 27.3% (down from 28.3%) and
   Bing-on-Firefox was at 5.9% (down from 6.2%). StatCounter says that it
   was not just Firefox users that led to the small decline. Yahoo usage
   in the US excluding Firefox users was also down slightly from 8.2% in
   January to 8.1% in February. Firefox users generated 14% of US internet

   2015: January saw Yahoo further increase the gain it made in US search
   share last month, according to the latest data from independent website
   analytics provider, StatCounter. Google fell below 75% in the US for
   the first time since StatCounter Global Stats began recording data*.
   StatCounter Global Stats reports that in January, Google took 74.8% of
   US search referrals followed by Bing on 12.4% and Yahoo on 10.9%, its
   highest US search share for over five years. "Some analysts expected
   Yahoo to fall in January as a result of Firefox users switching back to
   Google. In fact Yahoo has increased US search share by half a
   percentage point," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "It will
   be fascinating to see if these gains continue." StatCounter has also
   run a special report on US search engine usage by Firefox users only.
   Yahoo-on-Firefox usage in the US increased from 9.9% in November 2014
   to 28.3% in January. Over the same period Google-on-Firefox usage in
   the US fell from 81.9% to 63.9%. StatCounter says that it is only
   Firefox users responsible for the change in US search share. "When we
   removed Firefox usage from the US search data, Yahoo's gains and
   Google's losses were erased," commented Aodhan Cullen. "This highlights
   the importance of the default search option and the significance of the

   Mozilla's 10-year relationship with Google. "The move by Mozilla has
   had a definite impact on US search," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,

   http://gs.statcounter.com/press/three-times-more-yahoo-search-usage-on-
   firefox-34 San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 3rd December
   2014: On the 2nd December in the US, Yahoo search was used 3 times more
   on Firefox 34 than on Firefox 33, according to StatCounter, the
   independent website analytics company. As previously announced by
   Yahoo, this month marks the start of its partnership with Mozilla.
   Yahoo is now the default search experience for Firefox 34 in the US,
   replacing Mozilla's 10 year relationship with Google. A special report
   from StatCounter Global Stats finds that Yahoo usage on Firefox 34 in
   the US on the 2nd December was 29.4% compared to 9.6% for the previous
   version Firefox 33. Google search usage by Firefox users dropped from
   82.1% to 63.5% as they upgraded from version 33 to 34. Bing declined
   slightly from 6.5% on Firefox 33 to 5.8% on Firefox 34. "Firefox 34 is
   still being rolled out so its usage is currently quite low. It will be
   interesting to see how this develops," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "At the moment the change is having a negligible impact on
   overall search share in the US, but if this early usage trend on
   Firefox 34 continues then Yahoo could be on course to gain a number of

   2014: Windows 8.1 has broken the 10% mark and overtaken XP for the
   first time globally in terms of internet usage according to
   StatCounter, the independent website analytics company. The report from
   the company's research arm, StatCounter Global Stats shows that in
   November, Windows 8.1 at 10.95% narrowly beat XP to second place,
   pushing it to third at 10.69%. Windows 7 remains the most popular
   operating system on 50.3%. "Following a somewhat mixed reaction to
   Windows 8, Windows 8.1 has made steady progress since its launch,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "It passed Windows 8 in
   August and has now passed Windows XP in November. The growth trajectory
   for Windows 8.1 has been positive but if current trends continue it
   will not topple Windows 7 before Windows 10 is launched in 2015." In
   the US Windows 8.1 is at 12.2% having overtaken XP in October. Windows
   7 leads with 43.9%. In the UK, where Windows 8.1 overtook XP in April,
   XP has declined to 4.2% while Windows 8.1 is currently at 13.2%.

   StatCounter announces new web analytics apps San Francisco, CA &amp;
   Dublin, Ireland; Thursday 18th September 2014: The use of mobile
   devices to access the internet has increased by 67% worldwide over the
   last 12 months according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. The report from the company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats, finds that while desktop remains the most
   popular means to access the web on 64.6%, mobile has grown rapidly from
   17.1% to 28.5%. Tablet devices account for 6.8% of internet usage,
   compared to 4.8% 12 months ago. StatCounter announced the findings to
   mark the launch of its new web analytics apps for iOS and Android.
   These apps, which are free to download and use, are available from
   iTunes or Google Play. "Mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in
   several countries including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "All indications are that
   this trend is set to continue, which creates new challenges and
   opportunities for businesses globally." He noted that just three years
   ago desktop was the number one platform across all countries.
   StatCounter has produced an animated world map to show how this has
   changed since then. Mobile internet usage in the US has grown by 73%
   over the last 12 months to reach 24.4% in August. UK mobile internet
   usage is up by 69% to 23.2%. Other individual country stats are
   available at
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-monthly-201308-201408.
   Cullen added that mobile internet usage is increasing faster than
   tablet usage. "The slower growth of tablets may be due to the trend
   towards larger screen smartphones. It will be interesting to see
   whether Apple's new larger iPhone 6 Plus becomes a tablet killer."
   StatCounter Global Stats data is based on over 15 billion page views
   per month to over three million websites. Independent web analytics
   specialist StatCounter (www.statcounter.com) tracks millions of
   websites globally. Its new mobile website analytics apps allow members

   -iphone-6-announcement "Augurs well" for rumored launch of larger
   screen iPhone 6 San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 8th
   September 2014: The iPhone has been holding its own in terms of
   worldwide internet usage according to StatCounter, the independent
   website analytics company. The report from the company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats comes ahead of the expected announcement of
   the new iPhone 6 tomorrow (Tuesday). While recent reports from analysts
   such as Kantar* show falling sales figures for iPhone , Apple has
   maintained its internet usage worldwide on 23.6% in August 2014
   compared to 23.4% in the same month last year according to
   StatCounter**. At the same time Samsung has grown to 32.8% from 25.7%.
   StatCounter ranks mobile vendors based on internet usage rather than
   device sales. "Over the last year Apple has maintained its position in
   terms of internet usage despite the lack of a larger screen option, so
   this augurs well for the launch of iPhone 6," commented Aodhan Cullen,
   CEO, StatCounter. "Some analysts have predicted that iPhone will cede
   global market share to lower cost competitors in emerging markets but
   Apple probably won't lose too much sleep about this as long as they can
   win the higher margin end of the business." StatCounter research finds
   that Apple remains the clear leader in the US in terms of internet
   usage with 51.4% ahead of Samsung's 26.4%. Apple also leads in the UK
   with 46% compared to Samsung's 24.4%. Apple's operating system iOS
   (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) is also close to maintaining market share
   worldwide on 32.9% in August 2014 compared to 34.6% in the same month
   last year. Over the same period Android has increased from 35.7% to

   September 2014: Microsoft's Windows 8.1 operating system has overtaken
   its older sibling Windows 8 for the first time in terms of internet
   usage worldwide, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company.* The company's research arm, StatCounter Global
   Stats also finds that despite Microsoft's ending of support in April
   this year, Windows XP refuses to die and remains the world's second
   most popular operating system version. However, for the first time
   globally, the combined total of Windows 8 and 8.1 (14%) overtook XP
   (12.9%) in August. StatCounter finds that Windows 8.1 worldwide has
   grown steadily to 7.5% in August ahead of Windows 8 (6.6%). The newer
   operating system overtook its sibling in the UK in April and in the US
   in May. The data covers desktop, tablet and console. "Following a mixed
   reaction to Windows 8, perhaps because of its radical new look, Windows
   8.1 appears to be winning over users," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. However, he added that the stubborn refusal of Windows XP
   to retire almost five months after the ending of non-paid support is a
   concern in terms of security and virus risks for remaining users.
   Globally XP is on 12.9%, behind Windows 7 on 50.3%. In the US, XP
   internet usage share has declined below double figures to 8.9%.

   San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Wednesday 2nd April 2014: With
   less than a week to go before Microsoft pulls the plug on general
   support for Windows XP, it remains the second most popular operating
   system in the world in terms of internet usage, according to the latest
   data from StatCounter, the independent website analytics company. The
   company's research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that in March,
   Windows 7 was the global leader on 54.7% while XP remains in second
   place on 18.6%, more than double Mac OS X (all versions) on 8.6%.
   "Despite the stark warnings and publicity surrounding the end of
   support in six days' time, it appears that significant numbers of
   people are still using XP and sleep walking into a potential minefield
   of security and virus risks," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. Despite the risks, XP remains the second most popular OS
   in terms of internet usage in Europe (15.9%); South America (17.8%);
   Asia (24.9%) and Africa (30.5%). It is third in North America (14.5%).
   Oceania, where XP has dropped to fourth on 8%, appears to be the most
   progressive continent in terms of upgrading from the almost 13 year old
   operating system. In the US, XP is in third place on 15%. XP is also

   Despite news that Microsoft will discontinue support in April this year

   independent website analytics company. The company's research arm,
   StatCounter Global Stats, finds that in January 2014 Windows 7 was the

   Windows 8, 8.1 and Vista," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "This has serious implications for users, especially businesses, as

   Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 16th December, 2013: New
   data from independent web analytics firm StatCounter finds that global
   tablet internet usage was just 4.8% in November compared to 19.1% for
   mobile. Desktop usage still dominates with 76.1%.The company's research
   arm StatCounter Global Stats also reports that Apple's iPad is the
   clear leader in terms of tablet internet usage. "Samsung is in a
   distant second place although a challenge to the Cupertino company's
   lead cannot be ruled out given Samsung's success in the smartphone
   arena," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. The new data is
   revealed as StatCounter Global Stats today launches new tablet internet
   usage stats. Global and individual country stats are available free of
   charge at http://gs.statcounter.com/. StatCounter finds that worldwide
   Apple accounts for 74.5% of total tablet internet usage. Samsung has
   increased its share from 8.0% in November last year to 10.85%. "The
   perception is that tablets are proliferating and replacing traditional
   PC and laptop machines so we developed our research platform to isolate
   tablet usage stats," added Aodhan Cullen of StatCounter. "In reality we
   found that tablet internet usage globally at less than 5% is still
   relatively small compared to desktop and mobile." In the US tablet
   internet usage share stands at 6.8% or about half the mobile number
   (15.2%) with desktop on 77.9%. In the UK tablet is stronger than in the
   US on 9.6% behind mobile (14.8%) and desktop (75.4%). Out of all tablet
   internet usage in the US, Apple generates 80.3% followed by Amazon with
   the Kindle (7.4%) and Samsung (4.2%). In the UK Apple also dominates
   with 80.4% followed by Samsung (6.5%) and Amazon (4.4%). Other country

   San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Monday 9th September, 2013:
   Ahead of speculation that Apple will tomorrow announce a new lower cost
   iPhone, independent web analytics company StatCounter has released
   research highlighting the challenge the Cupertino headquartered company
   faces globally from Samsung. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global
   Stats finds that Samsung, which overtook Apple for the first time
   worldwide in June in terms of internet usage, has extended its lead to
   25.7% in August compared to Apple on 23.4%. Nokia, which led globally
   up until December last, is now in third place on 21.7%. In the US Apple
   remains the clear leader on 52.2% compared to Samsung's 19%. Nokia is
   on 1.5% in the US, representing an underdog opportunity for Microsoft
   following the announcement of its proposed partial acquisition of
   Nokia. In the UK Apple is also the clear leader in the mobile vendor
   battle on 46.8% in August compared to 21.5% for Samsung and 3.7% for
   Nokia. In India, Samsung has 26.7% usage share while Apple with just 1%
   currently has significant growth potential with the rumored lower cost
   iPhone. "Over the past 12 months Apple has increased its share in the
   US and UK but globally there is an on-going battle taking place between
   it and Samsung. Should the rumors prove true, it will be fascinating to
   see if a less expensive iPhone will help it increase market against
   lower cost competitors in global markets," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO
   StatCounter. For further analysis see:

   spot globally for first time in terms of internet usage Chrome tops
   Internet Explorer in US for first time San Francisco, CA &amp; Dublin,
   Ireland; Wednesday, 10th July, 2013: Samsung has overtaken Apple
   globally for the first time in June to take number one spot in terms of
   internet usage, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. In the United States Google's browser Chrome
   overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer for the first time in June.
   These are some of the findings in a new report from the firm's research
   arm, StatCounter Global Stats. The "StatCounter Internet Wars Report -
   Winners and Losers" charts progress over the last 12 months in the
   battle of the internet between the world's biggest tech firms including
   Apple, Google and Microsoft. The full report may be downloaded from:

   "The report charts winners and losers over the last 12 months in the
   battle to dominate the internet whether in the field of browsers,
   operating systems, search, mobile or social media," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. The report finds that while 12 months ago,
   Nokia led globally in terms of internet usage, Samsung (25.47%) has
   leapfrogged both Apple (25.09%) and Nokia (21.96%) to take the lead in
   June 2013. In the US and UK however, Apple remains the clear leader.
   While in May 2012 Chrome became the browser leader in terms of internet
   usage worldwide, it has now overtaken Internet Explorer for the first
   time in the United States as well. In June Chrome took the number one
   spot in the US at 34.02% (up from 23.84% 12 months ago). Over the same
   time frame IE declined to 32.46% (from 40.89%). Other highlights
   include: Operating Systems: Windows 7 increases internet usage share
   despite launch of Windows 8 - XP refuses to lie down Social Media:
   Reports of Facebook decline appear exaggerated - Twitter has greater

   new mobile research from StatCounter, the independent website analytics
   company. Samsung also climbed ahead of Nokia to take second place
   behind Apple on a worldwide basis. StatCounter's research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that in January 2013 Apple led globally

   predecessor-windows-7 Independent web analytics company finds license
   sales not yet translating into usage Boston, USA &amp; Dublin, Ireland;
   Friday, 30 November 2012: Windows 8 internet usage share is behind what
   its predecessor Windows 7 achieved one month after launch, according to
   data from StatCounter, the independent web analytics company. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats finds that by 26th
   November 2012 Windows 8 had worldwide internet usage share of 1.31%
   compared to 4.93% achieved by Windows 7 one month after its launch in
   2009. In the US Windows 8 took 1.77% of internet usage one month after
   launch compared to 5.21% for Windows 7 following its introduction.
   "Microsoft has reported license sales of 40 million for Windows 8,
   however this has not yet translated into significant usage figures.
   This may be due to sales to manufacturers rather than to end users so
   Windows 8 may well get a boost over the December holiday buying
   season," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. Globally Windows 7
   had 52.4% usage on November 26th, followed by Windows XP on 26.5%. In
   the US Windows 7 had 49.48% followed by XP with 16.07% which was just
   ahead of Mac OS on 15.48%. StatCounter Global Stats data is based on
   over 15 billion page views per month (4 billion from the US) to the
   StatCounter network of more than three million websites. Apart from its
   research arm, StatCounter (http://statcounter.com/) provides free
   website stats. This service allows website owners to capture valuable
   intelligence on their site in real time. New members may sign up at
   http://statcounter.com/. Notes: When comparing stats for Windows 7 and
   Windows 8, some additional contextual information may be relevant. Both
   Windows 7 and Windows 8 underwent significant periods of beta testing
   before their official launch dates. In absolute terms, Windows 8 is
   behind Windows 7 one month post launch as outlined above. In relative
   terms however, Windows 8 has more than tripled its usage share in the
   first month after launch while Windows 7 only doubled its usage in the
   corresponding period. Usage Share at Launch Date* One month after
   launch Relative Increase Windows 7 2.21% 4.93% 223% Windows 8 0.38%

   time of the Hurricane Sandy tragedy. When considering any internet
   usage stats for the US during this period, it should be borne in mind
   that the aftermath of the hurricane may have affected typical internet
   usage at this time. As we only display the top five operating systems

   <p><strong>Boston, USA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Friday, 30 November
   2012:</strong> Windows 8 internet usage share is behind what its
   predecessor Windows 7 achieved one month after launch, according to
   data from StatCounter, the independent <a
   href="http://statcounter.com/">web analytics</a> company. The firm's
   research arm <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter Global
   Stats</a> finds that by 26th November 2012 Windows 8 had worldwide
   internet usage share of 1.31% compared to 4.93% achieved by Windows 7
   one month after its launch in 2009.</p> <p>In the US Windows 8 took
   1.77% of internet usage one month after launch compared to 5.21% for
   Windows 7 following its introduction.</p> <p>"Microsoft has reported
   license sales of 40 million for Windows 8, however this has not yet
   translated into significant usage figures. This may be due to sales to
   manufacturers rather than to end users so Windows 8 may well get a
   boost over the December holiday buying season," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.</p> <p>Globally Windows 7 had 52.4% usage on
   November 26th, followed by Windows XP on 26.5%. In the US Windows 7 had
   49.48% followed by XP with 16.07% which was just ahead of Mac OS on
   15.48%.</p> <p><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter Global

   analytics company finds eleven year old XP retains almost 30% usage
   share worldwide Boston, USA & Dublin, Ireland; Thursday, 25th October
   2012: Ahead of the launch of Windows 8, Microsoft still has a battle to
   kill off XP globally according to latest data from StatCounter, the
   independent web analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats finds that Windows XP, the operating system launched over
   10 years ago in October 2001, still has almost 30% usage share
   worldwide. Worldwide, Windows 7 held 52.2% usage share in September
   compared to 27.64% for XP. In the US Windows 7 is on 49.36% compared to
   16.42% for XP. Although it is a more recent operating system, Vista
   holds a lower share than XP with 7.58% of the global market and 11.67%
   in the US. "Our stats confirm the theory that business users in
   particular have been reluctant to move from XP," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, referring to the daily OS stats which display significant peaks
   in XP usage during the working week (Mon-Fri) combined with
   corresponding dips in the usage of Windows 7. "The new Windows 8
   interface represents a radical overhaul for Microsoft, allowing it to
   enter the tablet market with the new Surface. The scale of change of
   the desktop experience, however, may heighten the initial reluctance of
   traditional business users to upgrade to this new OS," he added. In the
   UK Windows 7 has 51.75% share followed by XP (15.57%) and Vista
   (12.95%). StatCounter Global Stats data is based on over 15 billion

   9th July: 2012: StatCounter, the independent web analytics firm, has
   launched a new video which in less than two minutes illustrates the
   changing world map of browser usage over the last four years. The
   animation can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtBlvutR9cU.
   "When we began the StatCounter Global Stats project in 2008,
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominated the global market," comments
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "There is much greater competition
   now. Although IE still leads in countries such as the US and UK, on a
   worldwide basis Google's Chrome overtook IE in May and maintained a
   narrow lead in June." He added that IE is not taking Chrome's challenge
   lying down. From May to June, IE increased its usage share by
   two-tenths of one percentage point, the first monthly increase since
   October/November 2011. On a weekly basis, while Chrome overtook IE in
   week 20 (14 - 20 May 2012), by week 24 (11 - 17 June 2012) IE had
   staged a fight-back and was exactly equal with Chrome in terms of
   browser usage for that seven-day period. Cullen added that
   not-for-profit Mozilla's Firefox is also a real contender. "The opening
   up of competition and greater choice can only be good news for users
   and help to create better browsers." StatCounter data is based on over
   15 billion page views per month (4 billion from the US; 800 million

   &#8220;Browser wars back with a vengeance&#8221; Boston, USA &amp;
   Dublin, Ireland; Friday 1st June, 2012: After weeks of speculation,
   Google's Chrome has unseated Microsoft Internet Explorer to become the
   world's top internet browser for the first time for a full calendar
   month in May, according to StatCounter, the independent website
   analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats
   says that Chrome surpassed IE for the first full day back in March and
   the achievement of the weekly milestone was widely reported on 21 May.
   For the full month of May according to StatCounter data from over 15
   billion page views, Chrome took 32.43% of the worldwide market compared
   to 32.12% for IE and 25.55% for Firefox. StatCounter says that a battle
   royal has broken out between Chrome, IE and Firefox. &#8220;While
   attention has recently been focused on the battle between Chrome and
   IE, not-for-profit Mozilla's Firefox with its loyal membership base
   should not be underestimated,&#8221; commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. He points out that an upswing of over 0.6% in Firefox
   usage from April to May 2012 (apparently at the expense of IE) helped
   to push Chrome into pole position.&#8220;The browser wars are back with
   a vengeance,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This time there are three major
   players competing for the top spot but, ultimately, the real winner
   will be the end user who can look forward to more choice and innovation
   as a result of this increased competition.&#8221; In a stunning display
   of growth, Chrome has gone from zero to market leader on a worldwide
   basis in less than four years. That said, while IE has ceded the top
   spot to Chrome for May 2012, Microsoft's newest browser version (IE9)
   is performing well and Firefox is holding its own. In the US, IE
   remains the dominant browser. IE is similarly dominant in the UK.
   StatCounter Global Stats has recently launched a new map feature which
   clearly illustrates the increasing global usage of Chrome. The increase
   is particularly evident when mapped data from May 2011 and May 2012 is
   compared  both IE and Firefox cede a significant number of countries to
   Chrome over the period. Ends Press queries For interview with Aodhan

   sers-at-weekends Web analytics firm research suggests acceptance of IE9
   by home users Boston, USA &amp; Dublin, Ireland; Tuesday, 8th May 2012:
   Microsoft's latest browser IE9 is performing strongly at the weekend
   according to StatCounter, the independent website analytics company.
   The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that, while
   total IE usage dips, IE9 usage peaks at weekends. Commenting, Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter said, "We have previously noted that Google's
   Chrome peaks at the weekend at the expense of IE. This seems to suggest
   that many home (as opposed to business) users prefer Chrome to IE.
   However, having drilled down further into our data, we have released a
   new statistic which allows the comparison of Chrome (all versions
   combined)* with the individual versions of other browsers. This shows
   that while IE6, 7 and 8 usage falls off at the weekend, IE9 spikes.
   This indicates that IE9 is bucking the trend of previous IE versions
   and is gaining home user traction." The weekend trend towards both
   Chrome and IE9 peaking is repeated across US and UK users. StatCounter
   data is based on over 15 billion page views per month (4 billion from
   the US; 850 million from the UK) to the StatCounter network of more
   than three million websites. Apart from its research arm, StatCounter
   provides free website traffic analysis. This allows website owners to
   capture valuable intelligence on their site in real time. Ends Press

   ers Web analytics firm reports that 1366x768 overtakes 1024x768 for
   first timeBoston, USA and Dublin, Ireland, Wednesday, 11th April, 2012:
   A major milestone in screen resolution sizes has been passed according
   to independent web analytics company, StatCounter. The company's
   research arm, StatCounter Global Stats reports that for the first time
   1366x768 has become the most popular screen resolution worldwide,
   having overtaken 1024x768. "The data reflects a continuing trend of
   users moving to larger screen resolution sizes," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The screen resolution size people are using
   is a critical factor for developers when it comes to web design,
   particularly in the case of fixed width web pages." Since StatCounter
   began its tracking of screen resolution in March 2009, as a free
   service to developers and other users, 1024x768 has been the dominant
   screen size globally on the web (excluding mobile*). 1024x768 has
   fallen from 41.8% in March 2009 to 18.6% in March 2012. Over the same
   period 1366x768 has grown from 0.68% to 19.28%.The third most popular
   size is 1280x800 at 13%. Cullen also said that while StatCounter Global
   Stats provides information on worldwide and regional trends, monitoring
   the specific screen resolutions being used to view individual sites is
   also very important. StatCounter (http://statcounter.com/) provides
   free website traffic analysis. This allows web developers to capture
   screen resolution stats on their own and on their client websites in
   real time. Other information available includes search terms, download
   stats, exit links and other data. StatCounter Global Stats data is

   independent website analytics company. The firm's research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats reports that Chrome topped the polls in India,

   added that Chrome still faces a battle to unseat its main rivals

   can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be
   seen, however the trend towards Chrome usage at weekends is undeniable.

   15th December, 2011: Google's Chrome 15 has become the most popular web
   browser version worldwide for the first time on a weekly basis,
   according to StatCounter, the free website analytics company. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that in the last
   full week in November, Chrome 15 took 23.6% of the worldwide market
   compared to Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 at 23.5%. If one aggregates
   all versions then IE still leads the global market with Chrome in
   second position, having overtaken Firefox in November. "Google
   announced Chrome for business exactly a year ago and IT administrators
   appear to have embraced it in a remarkably short time," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "Looking at the daily stats, Chrome 14
   and 15 have been overtaking IE8 at weekends since the beginning of
   October. However, Chrome 15 overtook IE8 for the first time during the
   five day working week, in week commencing 5th December. It looks as if
   people favour Chrome on weekends at home but office commercial use has
   now caught up." In the US Internet Explorer 8 continues to be the most
   popular browser version with 27.0% for week commencing 5th December
   compared to 18.1% for Chrome 15. However, in the UK Chrome 15 overtook
   IE8 in the week commencing November 7th. Last week (commencing 5th

   Microsoft's operating system Windows 7 overtook its 10 year old sibling

   the free website analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that in October Windows 7 took 40.5% of global web

   replace XP, is down at 11.2% globally. "Vista was like the ugly sister
   that few wanted to dance with," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Despite Microsoft trying to keep it back in the kitchen,
   XP has retained tremendous loyalty over the last decade. However, it
   looks like the younger Windows 7 is now emerging in the Cinderella
   role." The StatCounter analysis finds that Windows 7 overtook XP in the
   United States in April of this year and in Europe in July. However, in
   Asia Windows XP still retains a clear lead at 55% in October compared

   Mozilla's Firefox 4 reached 14.2% of the worldwide market in May,
   overtaking for the first time its previous 3.6 version which is on
   12.3%, according to StatCounter, the free website analytics company.
   The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that following
   its launch on March 22nd Firefox 4 has overtaken Microsoft's Internet
   Explorer 9.0 which is on 4.6% globally and is just behind Google's
   Chrome 11 which has 16%. "Firefox 4 has performed well since launch and
   is on an upward trajectory," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "This is particularly impressive as a Firefox upgrade has to be
   initiated or authorized by the user, unlike Chrome, for example, which
   undergoes automatic updates." When all versions are combined IE still
   leads the pack globally with 43.9% followed by Firefox with 29.3%. The

   compared to 10.7% for Firefox 3.6 while IE 9 is on 5.9%. Aodhan Cullen
   added that IE 9 is restricted by the fact that it only runs on Windows

   2011: Firefox overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) to become the
   number one browser in Europe in December 2010 according to StatCounter,
   the free website analytics company. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that in December, Firefox took 38.11% of European
   market share, compared to IE's 37.52%. "This is the first time that IE
   has been dethroned from the number one spot in a major territory,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "This appears to be
   happening because Google's Chrome is stealing share from Internet
   Explorer while Firefox is mainly maintaining its existing share."
   Google Chrome in third place is gaining market share in Europe and has
   grown to 14.58% compared to 5.06% in December last year. "We are
   probably seeing the impact of the agreement between European Commission
   competition authorities and Microsoft, to offer EU users a choice and

   rs Google's Android Gaining Market ShareBoston, USA and Dublin,
   Ireland; Wednesday 1st December, 2010: BlackBerry OS overtook Apple's
   iOS for the first time in the US in November in terms of mobile
   internet usage according to web analytics company, StatCounter. The
   company's research arm, StatCounter Global Stats finds that for the
   first time in the US BlackBerry OS at 34.3% overtook Apple's iOS which
   recorded 33% in November. Google's Android is rapidly gaining and has
   almost tripled internet market share from 8.2% last November to 23.8%
   this year. Apple's iOS has fallen from 51.9% to 33% over the same
   period. "These figures suggest that developers should not be developing
   solely for the iPhone to the exclusion of BlackBerry and Android,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. He added that, if current
   trends continue, BlackBerry and Android combined are on course to
   become twice the size of iOS as regards mobile internet usage in the
   next year. Commenting on Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 he said that
   it was not yet registering significantly in terms of internet usage but
   would be interesting to observe over the next year. "This data
   demonstrates that there is a battle royal already going on in the
   smartphone market for the consumer and business internet user. You can
   never underestimate Microsoft but it looks to have its work cut out."
   BlackBerry's US lead is not replicated in terms of worldwide share
   according to the StatCounter data. Globally Symbian OS leads with 31.9%

   September, 2010: In just over a year since its release to manufacturer
   (RTM), Windows 7 has overtaken Windows Vista for the first time in
   total market share worldwide according to web analytics firm,
   StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports
   that, in August, Windows 7 took 19.4% total market share, compared to
   Vista's 17.7% worldwide. XP continues to dominate the global market
   with 55.4% StatCounter specialises in website traffic analysis and
   provides free lifetime stats and free detailed analysis on the latest
   500 hits. It recently announced a major upgrade which increased the log
   quotas to its paying members by a minimum of 100% at no extra cost.
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter commented, "Africa, Asia and South
   America are driving the increased market share for Windows 7. Although
   there has been extremely good growth for Windows 7 in Europe and North
   America, it has yet to overtake Vista in these regions." Vista
   continues to outperform Windows 7 in North America with a market share
   of 24.7% compared to 20.7% for Windows 7 (Windows XP 40.6%). In Europe
   the gap is even closer with 22.7% for Vista compared to 21.9% for
   Windows 7 (XP 47.5%). Aodhan Cullen added, "The installed base of
   Windows Vista was very low in Africa, Asia and South America and now
   users in these regions are upgrading straight from Windows XP to
   Windows 7 giving rise to this leap in market share." The data is based
   on an analysis of 15 billion page views for August 2010 collected from
   the StatCounter network of over three million websites. Ends Press

   StatCounter. "Users are voting with their mice following the launch of
   the new Digg site." Monday had been named as "Abandon Digg Day" by some
   users. "It wasn't so much a 'Black Monday' for Digg as a 'Redd
   Monday'," added Cullen. The data is based on 15 billion page views

   2010: Usage of web browser Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) in the US and
   Europe fell below the 5% mark for the first time in May, according to
   web analytics company, StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that IE6 US usage has fallen to 4.7% from 11.5% 12
   months ago. "At these levels web developers now have valid
   justification not to support IE6 in the future," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. A number of sites including YouTube are
   already understood to have withdrawn support for IE6. StatCounter
   Global Stats reports that IE8 US usage increased to 30.5% in May from
   8.5% in the same month last year. IE7 is currently at 16.6% in the US.
   "IE6 has been a bit of a pain for many web developers and designers who
   have often had to recode their site to get it to work. There are also
   security implications in its continued usage," added Aodhan Cullen of
   StatCounter. However, globally he suggested that web designers were not
   out of the woods yet. "If your target market is Asia then IE6 still has
   20.8% usage. IE8 has only just overtaken it in Asia." Africa also
   continues to have high levels of usage of IE6. The data is based on an
   analysis of 15 billion page views (3.8 billion from the US and 4.3
   billion from Europe) for May 2010 collected from the StatCounter

   Twitter generates almost one in ten Social Media global hits to
   websites according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The firm's
   research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that Facebook is the
   primary source of traffic to global websites with almost half (48%) of
   Social Media hits followed by StumbleUpon with almost a quarter (25%).
   The data for March is based on 13 billion page views across the global
   StatCounter network of member sites. StatCounter, which provides free
   website traffic information, has recently added Social Media to its
   StatCounter Global Stats, a free online research tool for media,
   analysts, bloggers, researchers and members. StatCounter Global Stats
   monitors Internet market share battles including Search Engines,
   Browsers, Operating Systems including mobile and now Social Media.
   "From a business perspective the findings suggest that there is merit
   in having a corporate Facebook page or Twitter account ," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The surprise packet is StumbleUpon,
   which over the past year has been consistently in the top two Social
   Media sites in terms of generating global website traffic. Indeed, in
   the US in March StumbleUpon was number one ahead of Facebook in terms
   of website traffic generation." The top Social Media sites to generate
   global website traffic after Facebook, StumbleUpon and Twitter are
   YouTube (6%), reddit (4%), Digg (2%) and MySpace (2%). Mr Cullen added,
   "Social Media market share fluctuates a lot more than browser or search
   statistics. For example, Facebook peaked over Christmas and the New
   Year with almost three quarters of the total, perhaps reflecting its
   important role in communications between families and friends." He also
   noted that professional Social Media site LinkedIn was ranked at 12
   with 0.34%. "This does not reflect its importance as a business site as
   it is not directly comparable to the more consumer focused sites." Ends

   last-six-months Boston and Dublin: Wednesday, 13th January 2010: Google
   has been closing the gap on Chinese search engine leader Baidu over the
   last six months according to web analytics company StatCounter. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that at the end of
   2009 Baidu held 56% of the Chinese market compared to Google's 43%.
   "Google has made impressive gains in China since July last when it was
   at 30% compared to Baidu's 68%," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Our analysis suggests that given Google's recent strong
   performance, market share is certainly not the reason behind its threat
   to leave China at this time." At the end of 2009 Yahoo! and Bing's
   combined share of the Chinese search market stood at just 1.18%.
   Despite significant gains in China in the last six months, Google's
   market share there still lags its global penetration where it has over
   90% of the market. The analysis is based on 24 million search engine
   referring clicks from China which were collected between July and
   December 2009. Ends Press queries to: Kerri Crowley, Simpson Financial

   Apple Mac fans remain 'unimpressed'Boston (US) and Dublin (Ireland):
   Tuesday, 3rd November 2009: Windows 7 has had an encouraging start in
   the US and globally according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats reports that Windows 7
   weekly share went from 1.75% of the US market pre launch to 2.82% by
   the end of October. Globally too the news was positive for Microsoft
   with market share increasing to the same levels. "Windows 7 has hit the
   ground running and the underlying trend is positive for Microsoft,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "The new operating system
   should be further boosted by December holiday season sales of computers
   which will have Windows 7 preinstalled." He added that as expected it
   looks as if Windows 7 is taking market share from Vista and to a lesser
   extent XP. "In the US Vista has declined from 35.78% to 34.52% at the
   end of October. XP has seen a smaller fall from 48.92% to 48.47%." He
   added that one factor is clear from the analysis. "Apple Mac fans
   remain unimpressed by the global launch hype. Mac OS X grew over the
   same period in the US from 11.29% to 11.87%." Data is based on an
   analysis of 4.7 billion page views (1.1 billion from the US) which were
   collected during the three week period 12th October to the 1st November
   2009 from the StatCounter network of over three million websites.

   (US); Dublin (Ireland): Monday, 2nd November 2009: Microsoft's search
   engine Bing recovered market share slightly in the US in October
   according to web analytics firm, StatCounter. The firm's research arm
   StatCounter Global Stats finds that Bing took 8.86% in October, up from
   8.51% in September but below its peak of 9.64% in August. StatCounter
   says that Yahoo! continues to lose market share, down to 8.91% in
   October from 9.4% in September and 10.5% in August. Google took 80.39%
   of the US market, its largest share since November '08. "Bing's market
   share has stabilised after falling since mid August," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. "However, a worrying trend for Microsoft is
   that the combined Bing and Yahoo! market share has seen a steady
   decline from 20.36% in July to 17.77% in October." Globally, Bing and
   Yahoo! combined took 7.4% of the market compared to 90.81% for Google.
   Data is based on an analysis of 5.1 billion search engine referring
   clicks (1.27 billion from the US) which were collected during the
   period October 2008 to October 2009 from the StatCounter network of
   over three million websites. StatCounter, which provides free website

   Bing's monthly market share in the US and globally has fallen for the
   first time since its launch, according to analysis conducted by web
   analytics firm StatCounter. The firm's research arm StatCounter Global
   Stats finds that Bing's share of the US search market in September fell
   by over one percentage point to 8.51% from 9.64% in August. There was
   little consolation for Microsoft from the performance of its new
   partner, Yahoo! which also declined, to 9.40% from 10.50%. "The trend
   has been downwards for Bing since mid August," commented Aodhan Cullen,
   CEO, StatCounter. "The wheels haven't fallen off but the underlying
   trend must be a little worrying for Microsoft." Google was the
   beneficiary from the decline of its main rival, increasing by more than
   two percentage points to 80.08% in September from 77.83% the previous
   month. Globally, Bing also declined slightly to 3.25% from 3.58% - a
   trend mirrored by Yahoo! which fell to 4.37% from 4.84%. Google
   breached the 90% mark to 90.54% - similar to its global market share a
   year previously (90.53%). Data is based on an analysis of 4.6 billion

   Boston (US); Dublin (Ireland): Tuesday, 1st September, 2009:
   Microsoft's Bing search market share in the US grew by just 0.23% in
   August to 9.64%, the slowest monthly growth rate since its launch,
   according to analysis conducted by web analytics firm StatCounter. The
   firm's research arm StatCounter Global Stats also finds that Bing and
   Yahoo! combined declined slightly in August to 20.14% from 20.36% in
   July. "Perhaps a little worrying for Microsoft is that when you analyse
   the weekly data, Bing peaked for the week 10th - 16th August at 10.98%
   and has declined since then," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. Google increased its search market share slightly in the
   US in August from 77.54% to 77.83%. Globally Microsoft and Yahoo!
   combined took 8.42% of the search market in August, a decline of 0.35%
   on July's figure (8.77%). Google remains the dominant force in the
   global search market with 89.57% in August (89.23% in July). Data is
   based on an analysis of 1.073 billion search engine referring clicks
   (272 million from the US) which were collected in July and August from
   the StatCounter network of over three million websites. StatCounter,
   which provides free website traffic analysis, is one of the largest web

   August, 2009: Bing again slightly increased the Microsoft share of the
   US search market in July to 9.41% from 8.23% in June according to
   analysis conducted by web analytics firm StatCounter. The firm's

   combined Yahoo! figures suggests that the deal announced last week will
   have to demonstrate major future synergies if it is to make any dent in

   Google still dominates search engine market wars Dublin (Ireland):
   Friday, 10th July, 2009: For the second time since it was launched,
   Microsoft's Bing search engine overtook Yahoo! Thursday (9th July) in
   US usage according to analysis conducted by web analytics firm
   StatCounter. Bing took 12.9% of the US market ahead of Yahoo!'s 10.15%
   but still well behind market leader Google at 74.99% according to the
   company's research arm StatCounter Global Stats. See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#search_engine-US-daily-20090601-20090709 The
   last time Bing overtook Yahoo! on one day was shortly after launch on
   June 4th according to StatCounter. "The jump in Bing's share may
   reflect a positive review of the search engine compared to Google which
   appeared online in the New York Times on the 8th and in the print
   version on the 9th July," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.
   "While its lead over Yahoo! may not last into next week our data
   suggests that it is slowly but surely closing the gap." StatCounter
   earlier this month announced June figures which showed that Microsoft
   had 8.23% market share in the US behind Yahoo! at 11.04% with Google at
   78.48%. This research was based on an analysis of 1.316 billion search

   Microsoft's share of the search market by 1% in the US according to
   analysis for June conducted by web analytics firm StatCounter.
   Microsoft had 8.23% market share in June, behind Yahoo! at 11.04%

   Microsoft US market share has gone from 7.21% in April to 8.23% in
   June. "At first sight, a 1% increase in market share does not appear to
   be a huge return on the investment Microsoft has made in Bing but the
   underlying trend appears positive," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Steady if not spectacular might be the best way to
   describe performance to date." Looking at weekly trends for June,
   Aodhan Cullen said that Microsoft (Bing, Live Search and MSN Search in
   total) had peaked post launch at 9.21% in week 1st - 7th June. But
   after falling away in the following two weeks it had staged a comeback
   in the last week in June to 8.45%. Microsoft market share, May/June -

   While Bing has fallen back to third place behind Google and Yahoo! it
   is winning market share for Microsoft against its two main rivals in
   the US and worldwide according to latest analysis from StatCounter
   Global Stats. StatCounter analyzed search engine market share two weeks
   before and after the formal launch of Bing on May 28th (14th May to the
   27th May and the 28th May to 10th June). For the US market it found:
   Google decreased from 78.68% to 77.94% (-0.74%) Yahoo decreased from
   11.46% to 10.76% (-0.7%) Microsoft (Bing, MSN Search and Live Search)
   increased from 7.4% to 9% (+1.6%) (See:

   York (US) and Dublin (Ireland); Friday, 5th June, 2009: Microsoft's
   Bing overtook Yahoo! as the number two search engine in the United
   States and worldwide Thursday (4th June) according to data from
   StatCounter Global Stats. StatCounter says that Bing grabbed market
   share from Google. "It remains to be seen if Bing falls away after the
   initial novelty and promotion but at first sight it looks like
   Microsoft is on to a winner," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO,
   StatCounter. "Steve Ballmer is quoted as saying that he wanted
   Microsoft to become the second biggest search engine within five years.
   Following the breakdown in talks to acquire Yahoo! at a cost of $40bn
   it looks as if he may have just achieved that with Bing much sooner and
   a lot cheaper than anticipated." StatCounter's analysis for Thursday
   finds that in the US Bing leapfrogged Yahoo to take second place on
   16.28%. Yahoo! has 10.22%. Google still commands the US search engine
   market with 71.47%. StatCounter data globally finds that Bing at 5.62%

   2009: Mozilla Firefox 3.0 became the most popular web browser in Europe
   last week, overtaking Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 for the first
   time on a weekly basis according to web analytics firm StatCounter
   (http://gs.statcounter.com). Firefox 3.0 took 35.05% of the European
   web browser market followed by 34.54% for IE 7.0. (See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-eu-weekly-200904-200913).
   "The move is partly explained by a small switch from IE 7.0 usage to IE
   8.0 but also by growing market share overall by Firefox 3.0," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder StatCounter. "The data shows that
   Firefox is closing the gap and is now just 10% behind all IE versions
   in Europe." (See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-eu-weekly-200904-200913). The
   StatCounter analysis is based on four billion pageloads per month.

   share New York and Dublin, Monday, March 23, 2009: For the first time
   last week Windows Vista consistently broke 30% share of the operating
   system market in the United States according to research by StatCounter
   which provides free website traffic statistics. (See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-US-weekly-200903-200912). "Based on daily
   data Windows Vista has only topped 30% a few times before and only for
   a maximum of three days running. This is the first time it has broken
   through 30% on a weekly basis suggesting that it is gaining some
   consistent traction in the US," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and
   founder, StatCounter. However, he said that the data suggested that
   there was still resistance to Vista in the business market. "The data
   illustrates clearly that Vista peaks at the weekends while XP peaks
   during week days." (See:
   http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-US-daily-20090221-20090322). Cullen added
   that Mac OS X is gaining market share. Its share of the operating
   system market has grown 25% from 6.6% in January (week three) to 8.3%

   New York and Dublin, Friday, March 20, 2009: There has been limited
   take up to date of Microsoft's new Internet Explorer 8 according to
   research by StatCounter which provides free website traffic statistics.
   According to StatCounter Global Stats global usage in the first day of
   launch (March 19) was 1.39%. This is just above its previous day's
   market penetration of 1.33%. The new browser has been in public beta
   testing for about a year. By 20th March 17:00 GMT IE 8 market share had
   risen to 1.56%. "I suppose the kindest description of user reaction to
   IE 8's first public outing would be 'underwhelming'," commented Aodhan
   Cullen, CEO and founder of StatCounter. He contrasted the performance
   to the launch of Firefox 3 last June. "Firefox 3 managed to convert
   users from its previous browser. Usage of Firefox 3 more than doubled
   from 7.8% at beta testing to 18.9% over a three day period following
   the launch (June 16-18)." StatCounter is one of the largest website
   traffic monitoring companies in the world with over two million members
   globally. Over 40% are located in the US with 25% in Europe. Its

   2009: Mozilla Firefox 3 overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 for
   the first time in February in the Internet browser wars according to
   monthly data from StatCounter Global Stats (http://gs.statcounter.com)
   - the new free analysis tool. Internet Explorer 7 continues to lead
   globally with 41% market share. However, Firefox 3 is now in second
   place with 24% replacing IE 6. "Since its launch less than a year ago,
   Firefox 3 has attained nearly one quarter of the global market,"
   commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder, StatCounter. "IE 7 is
   consistently holding about 40% of the global market but IE 6 has fallen
   from 28% in July last to 22% in February this year."* The growth in
   usage of Firefox 3 can be partly attributed to users upgrading to the
   new version - Firefox 2 market share has fallen from 16% to 3% in the
   period. Microsoft's combined IE 7 and IE 6 market share has fallen from
   68% in July last year to 63% now. IE 8 has gained a toehold in the
   market of just over 1%. Firefox 3 and 2 has grown from 25% in July last
   to 27% in February '09. "The overall trend is what is interesting
   here," added Aodhan Cullen. The StatCounter analysis is based on four
   billion pageloads per month. StatCounter is one of the largest website

   -browser-wars - StatCounter research finds iPhone is number one mobile
   browser in US number two globally - MS Internet Explorer faces close
   competition from open source Firefox Tuesday, 18th March 2008: Apple
   has increased its share of the Internet browser market in the US by 64%
   between December and March according to StatCounter, which provides
   organisations and individuals with a free website visitor statistics
   tool.* Globally iPhone/iTouch has more than doubled its share of the
   Internet browser market from 0.03% to 0.08%. In March iPhone and iTouch
   increased their share of the total browser market in the US from 0.14%
   in December to 0.23% according to StatCounter which tracks in excess of
   nine billion pageloads per month over its network of two million
   websites. If one excludes iTouch from the figures then iPhone's market
   share of Internet browsing in the US (0.18%) is still well ahead of
   Nokia (0.01%). However, Nokia still maintains a significant lead over
   Apple in the global market with 0.25% to 0.08%. "The key message is
   that iPhone is more than living up to its claims of being a user
   friendly Internet browser, unlike many other mobile phones," commented
   Aodhan Cullen, founder and CEO of StatCounter. He said that iPhone web
   browsing peaked in the US on Christmas Day at 0.07%. "Presumably this
   was due to people trying out their new Christmas present combined
   perhaps with not accessing PCs that day." The StatCounter analysis
   finds that Microsoft Internet Explorer still leads the browser market
   overall with 44.5% market share in the US. But it is facing real
   competition from open source based Firefox which grew to 43.9% of the
   US browser market. Globally Internet Explorer is well ahead at 59% with
   Firefox on 33%. The StatCounter analysis was based on a sample of 372
