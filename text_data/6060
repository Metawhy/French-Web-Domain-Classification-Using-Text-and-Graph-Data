Google Releases Trove of Deepfake Videos So Researchers Can Help Fight Them
(fastcompany.com)

   Posted by msmash on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @10:23AM from the
   marching-forward dept.
   Google has announced it has released a data set containing 3,000
   deepfake videos it has created. From a report: Google hopes the release
   of the videos will allow researchers to develop ways to combat
   malicious deepfakes, giving them, news organizations, and the public
   ways to identify "synthetic" videos -- that is videos manipulated by or
   entirely created using computers. Deepfakes at first came onto the
   scene in 2017 and were mainly used in crude, falsified porn videos. The
   technology originally allowed for people with limited computer skills
   to easily paste the face of, for example, an actress onto a porn star's
   body. But since then the quality of deepfake videos has rapidly
   advanced. Matter of fact, it's now possible to deepfake entire bodies,
   not just an individual's head. While deepfake technology has legitimate
   commercial purposes, many fear it will also lead to a new era of fake
   news and propaganda where no one will be able to tell if the video they
   are seeing actually, in fact, ever happened.

US Lawmakers Propose $1 Billion Fund To Replace Huawei Equipment
(reuters.com) 20

   Posted by msmash on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @09:00AM from the
   tussle-continues dept.
   A U.S. House panel unveiled bipartisan legislation this week that would
   authorize $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace
   network equipment from companies including Huawei and ZTE that
   lawmakers say pose a national security risk. From a report: The
   legislation is similar to a bill approved in July by the U.S. Senate
   Commerce Committee that would authorize about $700 million in grants to
   remove Huawei equipment, in a bid to boost the security of the U.S.
   telecommunication network's supply chain. The top Democrats and
   Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a joint
   statement the bill would protect the "nation's communications networks
   from foreign adversaries by helping small and rural wireless providers
   root-out suspect network equipment and replace it with more secure
   equipment."

How TikTok Censors Videos That Do Not Please Beijing (theguardian.com) 12

   Posted by BeauHD on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @07:30AM from the
   permission-required dept.
   According to leaked documents revealed by the Guardian, TikTok
   instructs its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen
   Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong.
   "The documents [...] lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered
   technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign
   policy aims abroad through the app," writes Alex Hern for the Guardian.
   From the report: The guidelines divide banned material into two
   categories: some content is marked as a "violation," which sees it
   deleted from the site entirely, and can lead to a user being banned
   from the service. But lesser infringements are marked as "visible to
   self," which leaves the content up but limits its distribution through
   TikTok's algorithmically-curated feed. This latter enforcement
   technique means that it can be unclear to users whether they have
   posted infringing content, or if their post simply has not been deemed
   compelling enough to be shared widely by the notoriously unpredictable
   algorithm.
   The bulk of the guidelines covering China are contained in a section
   governing "hate speech and religion." In every case, they are placed in
   a context designed to make the rules seem general purpose, rather than
   specific exceptions. A ban on criticism of China's socialist system,
   for instance, comes under a general ban of "criticism/attack towards
   policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy,
   monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system,
   etc." Another ban covers "demonization or distortion of local or other
   countries' history such as May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Cambodian
   genocide, Tiananmen Square incidents."
   A more general purpose rule bans "highly controversial topics, such as
   separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups,
   for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts, inciting the
   independence of Northern Ireland, Republic of Chechnya, Tibet and
   Taiwan and exaggerating the ethnic conflict between black and white."
   All the above violations result in posts being marked "visible to
   self." But posts promoting Falun Gong are marked as a "violation,"
   since the organization is categorized as a "group promoting suicide,"
   alongside the Aum cult that used sarin to launch terrorist attacks on
   the Tokyo Metro in 1995 and "Momo group," a hoax conspiracy that went
   viral earlier this year. ByteDance said in a statement that the version
   of the documents that the Guardian obtained was retired in May, and
   that the current guidelines do not reference specific countries or
   issues.

Apple Says a Bug May Grant 'Full Access' To Third-Party Keyboards By Mistake
(techcrunch.com) 28

   Posted by msmash on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @06:00AM from the
   security-woes dept.
   Apple is warning users of a bug in iOS 13 and iPadOS involving
   third-party keyboards. From a report: In a brief advisory posted
   Tuesday, the tech giant said the bug impacts third-party keyboards
   which have the ability to request "full access" permissions. iOS 13 was
   released last week. Both iOS 13.1 and iPadOS 13.1, the new software
   version for iPads, are out today. Third-party keyboards can either run
   as standalone, or with "full access" they can talk to other apps or get
   internet access for additional features, like spell check. But "full
   access" also allows the keyboard maker to capture to its servers
   keystroke data or anything you type -- like emails, messages or
   passwords. This bug, however, may allow third-party keyboards to gain
   full access permissions -- even if it was not approved.

What 'Ad Astra' and Brad Pitt Get Wrong About Space Travel, Science and Life
In the Cosmos (nbcnews.com) 42

   Posted by BeauHD on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @04:30AM from the
   failed-mission dept.
   Freshly Exhumed writes: Adam Frank, professor of astrophysics at the
   University of Rochester and consultant on numerous movie scripts, was
   excited to watch "Ad Astra," the new Brad Pitt space thriller. The film
   was promoted with the promise of scientific realism in depicting a
   solar system well on its way to being settled by humanity.
   Unfortunately, Professor Frank finds that despite very good intentions,
   "Ad Astra" strikes the wrong balance between story and fact, art and
   artifice. While the plot ventures out to the farthest planet Neptune,
   the demands of the film's theme cramp its science fiction imagination.
   Instead of letting us explore a vision of our common future in space,
   "Ad Astra" delivers a solar system stripped down to fit a very
   particular story.

Nuclear Energy Too Slow, Too Expensive To Save Climate, Says Report
(reuters.com) 199

   Posted by BeauHD on Wednesday September 25, 2019 @03:00AM from the
   A-for-effort dept.
   dryriver shares a report from Reuters: Nuclear power is losing ground
   to renewables in terms of both cost and capacity as its reactors are
   increasingly seen as less economical and slower to reverse carbon
   emissions, an industry report said. In mid-2019, new wind and solar
   generators competed efficiently against even existing nuclear power
   plants in cost terms, and grew generating capacity faster than any
   other power type, the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report
   (WNISR) showed. "Stabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is
   slow," said Mycle Schneider, lead author of the report. "It meets no
   technical or operational need that low-carbon competitors cannot meet
   better, cheaper and faster."
   The report estimates that since 2009 the average construction time for
   reactors worldwide was just under 10 years, well above the estimate
   given by industry body the World Nuclear Association (WNA) of between 5
   and 8.5 years. The extra time that nuclear plants take to build has
   major implications for climate goals, as existing fossil-fueled plants
   continue to emit CO2 while awaiting substitution. "To protect the
   climate, we must abate the most carbon at the least cost and in the
   least time," Schneider said. The WNA said in an emailed statement that
   studies have shown that nuclear energy has a proven track record in
   providing new generation faster than other low-carbon options, and
   added that in many countries nuclear generation provides on average
   more low-carbon power per year than solar or wind. It said that reactor
   construction times can be as short as four years when several reactors
   are built in sequence. According to the report, the cost of generating
   solar power ranges from $36 to $44 per MWh, while onshore wind power
   comes in at $29-$56 per MWh. Nuclear energy costs between $112 and
   $189.
   "Over the past decade, the WNISR estimates levelized costs -- which
   compare the total lifetime cost of building and running a plant to
   lifetime output -- for utility-scale solar have dropped by 88% and for
   wind by 69%," reports Reuters. "For nuclear, they have increased by
   23%, it said."

Brain Research On Boys' Preference For Video Games and Girls' For Social
Media (wsj.com) 104

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @11:30PM from the
   let's-look-at-the-science dept.
   An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Wall Street Journal: Many
   parents of both boys and girls have witnessed striking differences in
   the way their kids use technology, with their sons generally
   gravitating to video games and their daughters often spending more of
   their screen time scrolling through social media. Emerging research
   indicates that brain differences between males and females help account
   for the split. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Pew Research
   Center, 41% of teenage boys said they spend too much time playing video
   games while only 11% of girls said they do. Marc Potenza, a psychiatry
   professor at Yale University, teamed up with researchers at
   universities in China to find out why. Using functional MRIs, which
   measure brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, the team
   studied neural responses in young male and female gamers, particularly
   in the parts of the brain associated with reward processing and craving
   -- a motivating factor in addiction. When the men and women were shown
   photos of people playing video games, those parts of the men's brains
   showed higher levels of activation than those parts of the women's
   brains. Brain regions that have been implicated in drug-addiction
   studies also were shown to be more highly activated in the men after
   gaming. The researchers said the results suggest men could be more
   biologically prone than women to developing internet gaming disorder.
   But girls and women aren't free from problems when it comes to digital
   media. Data from Pew shows that, in general, women use social platforms
   such as Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest far more than men. Many girls
   and women are drawn to those photo-sharing sites because they like to
   form bonds and find similarities, says Rosanna Guadagno, a social
   psychologist at Stanford University. Even if women only use those sites
   more than men because that is where their friends are, many experts and
   parents say they have found that girls appear to have a greater fear of
   missing out, which compels them to keep up with what their friends are
   posting. Some recent studies show that girls feel the ill effects of
   too much social media use, such as depression and anxiety, more than
   boys do.

   Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi tweeted today that Microsoft is now being used
   on over 900 million devices, and that the Redmond company added more
   new Windows 10 devices in the last 12 months than ever before. Engadget
   reports: That's a massive number, and as Thurrott points out, if
   Microsoft maintains this pace, Windows 10 could reach 1 billion devices
   by early 2020. That's especially impressive considering that it just
   announced 800 million devices in March.

Court Says FCC Ignored Hard Data In Rush To Help Media Companies (vice.com)
25

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @07:40PM from the
   major-victories dept.
   The FCC's multi-year effort to kill media consolidation rules at the
   behest of giants like Sinclair Broadcasting has been rejected by the
   courts, who ruled the agency failed to seriously consider the negative
   impact unchecked media monopolies have on the public at large.
   Motherboard reports: In a 2-1 new ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
   the Third Circuit forced the FCC to go back to the drawing board in its
   quest to make life easier for media giants, arguing the agency "did not
   adequately consider the effect its sweeping rule changes will have on
   ownership of broadcast media by women and racial minorities."
   In 2017, Pai's FCC voted to eliminate a cap preventing any one
   broadcaster from reaching more than 39 percent of the nation, a
   77-year-old rule requiring broadcasters keep a local studio in the
   towns they service (to encourage community participation), as well as
   rules preventing broadcasters from owning more than two TV stations and
   one radio station in the same market. These changes were intended to
   help companies like Sinclair Broadcasting, whose proposed $3.7 billion
   merger with Tribune Media would have given the company ownership of
   more than 230 broadcast stations, reaching 72 percent of the American
   public. That deal was scuttled last year after Sinclair was accused of
   misleading the FCC to gain regulatory approval. The court said that FCC
   analysis justifying its decision was "so insubstantial that it would
   receive a failing grade in any introductory statistics class."

Xiaomi's Mi Mix Alpha Has a Display On the Front, Sides, and Back
(theverge.com) 49

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @07:00PM from the
   concept-phones dept.
   The latest phone in the Xiaomi Mi Mix series is the Mi Mix Alpha, a
   $2,800 smartphone with a "surround screen" that wraps entirely around
   the device to the point where it meets the camera module on the other
   side. "The effect is of a phone that's almost completely made of
   screen, with status icons like network signal and battery charge level
   displayed on the side," reports The Verge reports. "Pressure-sensitive
   volume buttons are also shown on the side of the phone. Xiaomi is
   claiming more than 180 percent screen-to-body ratio, a stat that no
   longer makes any sense to cite at all." From the report: The Mix Alpha
   uses Samsung's new 108-megapixel camera sensor, which was co-developed
   with Xiaomi. As with other recent high-resolution Samsung sensors,
   pixels are combined into 2x2 squares for better light sensitivity in
   low light, which in this case will produce 27-megapixel images. There's
   also no need for a selfie camera -- you just turn the phone around and
   use the rear portion of the display as a viewfinder for the
   108-megapixel shooter.
   As for the phone's more traditional specs, there's a Qualcomm
   Snapdragon 855+ processor, 5G connectivity, 12GB of RAM, 512GB of
   storage, 40W wired fast-charging, and a 4,050mAh battery. That last
   spec would perhaps suggest that Xiaomi doesn't imagine you having the
   whole screen turned on all the time. Xiaomi describes the Mix Alpha as
   a "concept smartphone" and isn't going to be mass-producing it any time
   soon. The phone will go into small-scale production this year and go on
   sale in December for 19,999 yuan, or about $2,800. The original Mi Mix
   was also given the "concept" label and released in small quantities,
   with the Mi Mix 2 following a year later as a more mainstream device.

Sprint Took FCC Cash For 'Serving' 885,000 People It Wasn't Actually Serving
(arstechnica.com) 41

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @06:20PM from the
   money-grab dept.
   An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sprint has been
   caught taking millions of dollars in government subsidies for "serving"
   885,000 low-income Americans who weren't using Sprint service, the
   Federal Communications Commission said today. Sprint violated the
   Lifeline program's "non-usage rule" that requires providers of free,
   subsidized plans to de-enroll subscribers who haven't used their phones
   recently, the FCC said. "It's outrageous that a company would claim
   millions of taxpayer dollars for doing nothing. This shows a careless
   disregard for program rules and American taxpayers," FCC Chairman Ajit
   Pai said. "I have asked our Enforcement Bureau to investigate this
   matter to determine the full extent of the problem and to propose an
   appropriate remedy."
   Sprint has admitted the mistake and said it will pay the money back.
   Like the FCC's other universal service programs, Lifeline is paid for
   by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills. The FCC said Sprint's
   violation "initially came to light as a result of an investigation by
   the Oregon Public Utility Commission." Because of that investigation,
   the FCC said it "has learned that Sprint Corp. claimed monthly
   subsidies for serving approximately 885,000 Lifeline subscribers, even
   though those subscribers were not using the service." The 885,000
   subscribers that Sprint wasn't actually serving "represent nearly 30%
   of Sprint's Lifeline subscriber base and nearly 10% of the entire
   Lifeline program's subscriber base," the FCC said. The FCC didn't say
   exactly how much money Sprint received through its violation of the
   non-usage rule, but one month's worth of $9.25 payments for 885,000
   subscribers would amount to $8.2 million.

Mysterious Avid Issue Knocks Out Mac Pro Workstations Across Hollywood
(variety.com) 81

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @05:40PM from the
   technical-difficulties dept.
   A possible computer virus attack has knocked out Mac Pro workstations
   for many film and TV editors across Los Angeles. According to Variety,
   the issue -- which is causing the workstations to refuse to reboot --
   is widespread among users of Mac Pro computers running older versions
   of Apple's operating system as well as Avid's Media Composer software.
   From the report: Avid said in a statement that it was aware of the
   issue: "Avid is aware of the reboot issue affecting Apple Mac Pro
   devices running some Avid products, which arose late yesterday. This
   issue is top priority for our engineering and support teams, who have
   been working diligently to determine and resolve the root cause. As we
   learn more, we will immediately publish information -- directly to our
   customers and via our community forums and social media platforms -- in
   order to resolve this issue for all affected customers and prevent any
   further issues."
   "A lot of L.A. post shops and people out on shows having their Macs
   slowly crash," reported video post-production consultant Matt Penn on
   Twitter. Freelance film editor Marcus Pun reposted a message from a
   popular Avid Facebook user group, advising users not to turn off their
   workstations. Other users reported that multiple computers at their
   company were affected by the issue, with social media chatter
   indicating that a number of different companies, and even major shows
   like "Modern Family," were affected by the issue.

German Prosecutors Indict Top VW Bosses Over Diesel Emissions Scandal
(reuters.com) 31

   Posted by BeauHD on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @05:00PM from the
   gift-that-keeps-on-giving dept.
   dryriver shares a report from Reuters: German prosecutors have accused
   Volkswagen's CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged
   emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval
   at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of
   clean driving. Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday
   they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against
   Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans
   Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn. The charges show how
   the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal
   software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on
   from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle
   refits, fines and provisions. In a statement issued after an emergency
   meeting, the (VW supervisory) board's executive committee said it
   "cannot see that there was any deliberate attempt not to inform the
   capital market." The former U.S. regulator who helped bring
   Volkswagen's cheating to light dismissed the company's arguments. "The
   excuse that top managers knew nothing is very weak," Alberto Ayala, who
   served at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) until 2017, told
   German news magazine Spiegel. Separately on Tuesday, German prosecutors
   hit rival carmaker Daimler with an 870 million euro fine for breaking
   diesel emissions rules. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars
   said it would not appeal.

   emerging-trends dept.
   An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard: Eighty Google
   contract workers in Pittsburgh employed by HCL America voted Tuesday to
   unionize with the United Steel Workers (USW). They will organize under
   the name Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals (PATP). The vote
   to unionize passed, with 49 voting in favor of unionization and 24
   voting against unionization. Damon Di Cicco, organizer with the United
   Steelworkers, said that PATP was formed with support from the
   Department for Professional Employees (DPE), a semi-autonomous branch
   of the AFL-CIO, representing more than four million professional,
   technical, and other highly skilled workers. The vote to unionize is
   historic for white collar tech workers, and could spur others in the
   industry to take similar action.
   The idea, said Di Cicco, was to create an umbrella organization to
   facilitate organizing in the tech sector, and eventually to help tech
   locals coordinate and cooperate amongst themselves. Di Cicco said the
   formation of PATP happened separately, but simultaneously, with the
   push to unionize by HCL workers. Now, the group has its first victory.
   The vote comes despite attempts by HCL to prevent its employees from
   unionizing. Emails shared with Motherboard show that Jeremy Carlson,
   HCL America's deputy general manager of operations sent at least a
   half-dozen emails to contractors in the two week period before the
   vote. Many of them urged employees not to unionize.

WeWork's Neumann Is Stepping Down as CEO (bloomberg.com) 64

   Posted by msmash on Tuesday September 24, 2019 @02:00PM from the
   that-escalated-quickly dept.
   Adam Neumann, the charismatic entrepreneur who led WeWork to become one
   of the world's most valuable startups, is stepping down as chief
   executive officer, after a plan to take the company public hit a wall.
   From a report: Members of WeWork's board have been pressuring Neumann
   in recent days to step aside, taking a new role as non-executive
   chairman. The move is designed to salvage an initial public offering,
   which had been met with immediate scorn from public investors. A litany
   of apparent conflicts of interest and Neumann's propensity to burn
   through capital were chief concerns. Two senior WeWork executives,
   Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, will become co-CEOs. WeWork's
   parent company, We Co., intends to push ahead with the IPO, but some
   people briefed on the deliberations said it's unlikely to take place
   next month as planned. The new CEOs said in a statement that they will
   be "evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO."
