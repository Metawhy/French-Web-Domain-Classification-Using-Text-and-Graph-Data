   Los Angeles, CA – JULY 16, 2019 – 100 Thieves, the leading lifestyle
   brand and esports organization, today announced it has completed its
   Series B funding round. Artist Capital Management, the New York-based
   growth investment firm, has led the $35M round and its Chief Investment
   Officer, Josh Dienstag, will join 100 Thieves’ Board of Directors. The
   Series B also includes a new investment from Aglaé Ventures, the
   technology investment firm of Groupe Arnault, controlling shareholder
   of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH).

   “This past year has been a massive success for 100 Thieves. Our esports
   teams are winning championships, our apparel is selling out, and our
   podcasts have topped the charts,” said Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag, Founder
   & CEO of 100 Thieves. “Artist Capital Management saw our vision and our
   progress and has stepped up to support us. We now have everything we
   need to be the biggest gaming & esports brand in the world.”

   Since raising its Series A in October of 2018, 100 Thieves has
   experienced tremendous success and growth across all of its business
   units. Competitively, 100 Thieves has won the two most recent Call of
   Duty major championships, competed in the 2018 League of Legends World
   Championships, and is sending six qualifiers to the upcoming Fortnite
   World Cup. Its limited-edition apparel continues to sell out, including
   its most recent record-breaking drop, which generated over $500,000 in
   revenue in under 5 minutes.  It has also built itself into a modern
   media company, featuring superstar gaming talents such as CouRage and
   Valkyrae. In May, the company launched its first two podcasts – The
   CouRage & Nadeshot Show and Selfmade with Nadeshot – and saw them debut
   at #1 and #2 respectively on the iTunes Gaming Podcast charts.

   “As long-term investors, we believe that 100 Thieves has a
   differentiated approach to esports and gaming,” said Josh Dienstag,
   Chief Investment Officer of Artist Capital Management.” 100 Thieves has
   a visionary founder, a best-in-class management team, and premier
   strategic shareholders. We are very excited to support 100 Thieves with
   the growth capital they need to see their vision through.”

   With the new capital, 100 Thieves plans to continue to aggressively
   expand in competitive esports, apparel, and developing new gaming
   entertainment content.  Additionally, the company today has announced
   the development of its new 15,000 sq ft headquarters. Located in Los
   Angeles, this new facility will house the company’s entire operation –
   including esports practice facilities, streaming stations, a content
   production soundstage, and an apparel development workshop. Most
   notably, 100 Thieves headquarters will also serve as a retail
   storefront for the brand’s upcoming apparel drops.

   100 Thieves is co-owned by its Founder & CEO Matthew Haag, global
   recording superstar Drake, SB Projects founder Scooter Braun, and
   Cleveland Cavaliers and Quicken Loans chairman Dan Gilbert. The company
   has raised $60 million in funding since its inception in November 2017
   from investors including Sequoia, Ludlow Ventures, Courtside Ventures,
   Green Bay Ventures, Tao Capital, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Dropbox
   CEO Drew Houston, WndrCo, and Advancit Capital.
