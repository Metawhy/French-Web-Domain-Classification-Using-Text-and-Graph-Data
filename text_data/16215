The State of Housing in the EU 2017

Housing is still Europe’s challenge

The Housing Europe Observatory, the Research branch of Housing Europe,
presents the 2017 edition of its flagship report ‘The State of Housing in the
EU’, the biennial compass of Europe's housing sector.

   Although growth has returned to big parts of our continent, as
   President Juncker cheered on at his recent ‘State of the Union’ speech,
   this growth is leaving many behind and our societies are increasingly
   unequal. Similarly, the recent ‘recovery’ in housing markets is far
   from benefitting everyone and the state of housing in the European
   Union today remains critical. The 2017 edition of the ‘State of Housing
   in the EU’ provides proof that Europe’s housing challenge is far from
   over:
     * Housing has become the highest expenditure for Europeans and
       overburden rate remains stable at high level, hitting
       disproportionally harder the poor.
     * House prices are growing faster than income in most Member States,
       while inequality and housing exclusion are mutually reinforcing.
     * Territorial divide is alarming, as finding adequate and affordable
       housing in places where job opportunities are, is increasingly
       hard.
     * As the level of housing construction is still low, especially major
       cities face a structural housing shortage reinforced by recent
       waves of migration.
     * Political response to Europe’s housing challenge remains poor, a
       fact reflected in increasing levels of homelessness. Only cities,
       that are at the forefront of the housing crisis, are showing a more
       prominent role in finding solutions.

   Housing Europe President, Cédric van Styvendael commented on the
   findings of the report: “There is no better indicator than housing to
   help us do a reality check. Just one month after the ‘State of the
   Union’ by President Juncker I regret having to deliver the message that
   Europe’s housing challenge is still prevalent and addressing it
   requires political will at all levels and investment on what already
   works on the ground. Housing is no field for sorcerer’s apprentices”.
