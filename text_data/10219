            It should work with all version, but I have not tested with
            all.
            I tested only with r13,r14 and r15 and probably with r12
            What is your version?
            Now I can not test it, as soon as possible I test it with
            other version and I’ll let you know
            Ps. since it went on sale, I’ve ever had a complaint about the
            compatibility

            Hi Mike,
            You don’t need to install this tool, you just open “C4D Liquid
            Shape Morph TOOL.c4d” in CINEMA 4D.

       Does this product work with C4D Visualize?
       I’m getting an error message that certain plugins are missing when
       I open the c4D file..
       Plain, Random, Spline, Data Tag, Cloner.

            MoGraph module is required. Visit this page to check if this
            module is included in your version of CINEMA 4D:

Cinema 4D Camera Mapping Breakdown

Paris Freeze Time

Camera Mapping in Cinema 4D & Compositing in After Effects.

   Photo Source by Lyodoh KANEKO
   Music : Edith Piaf – Paris – 1949
   Watch Tutorial

Camera Mapping allows you to project a texture (in most cases a photograph)
on some simple geometry to create a 3D object that can be used in more then
one camera angle. Of course the angle is limited but small movements are
possible, which is often sufficent. This technique is based on recreating the
original camera postion, angle and optical settings. If you have precise
information on this you can use it directly, but in many cases some
adjustment by sight will suffice.

   Visit the Tips & Techniques – Camera a basic tutorial from maxon.net.

   Here’s some examples of using images with basic geometry, from Video
   Copilot Blog.

Tutorial #01 – After Effects VFX Rain Scene

   By Mustapha FERSAOUI | Tutorial | 13 Comments

In this Tutorial I use the CC Rain effect already in available in After
Effects, using several layers of rain with varying speeds and focuses.
To reveal the reflection of car on the floor, I used Photoshop for preparing
the reflect of car then in After Effects by using the distort effect on the
street floor &amp; the roof of the car. This was all done with layers over
layers with masking and distortion mesh.

   By Mustapha FERSAOUI | Blog | No Comments

What's New in the Version 1.1

   The title generated by Folding Title GENERATOR (FTG) is partitioned
   into several square, each of these square is equal to one object.
   Adding a Hair to all these objects using the standard tool of Cinema 4D
   “add Hair” becomes very complex and it takes a lot of time and also
   requires an some technical knowledge on FTG plugin.

   For these reason we have created this new feature “FTG-Add Hair”, it
   allow you to add hair in your folding title with a simple click.

Changelog

     * ADDED: “Add Hair” This new feature help you to easily add hair in
       your folding title.
     * ADDED: “Reverse Normals” Reversing the Normals to grow hair in the
       opposite surface of layer.
     * EXTRA: Sci-Fi Title Template (Video Preview).
     * Fixed a conflict with character “C” & “L” (Image Preview).
     * IMPROVED: We have made a change in the “Force Update” button. It
       now works with a simple click!
     * IMPROVED:  A lot of other minor correction.
