IBM Launches Research Collaboration Center to Drive Next-Generation AI
Hardware

   Artificial intelligence has the potential to solve some of science and
   industry’s most vexing challenges. But for that to happen, it needs a
   new generation of computer systems. Today, AI’s ever increasing
   sophistication is pushing the boundaries of the industry’s existing
   hardware systems as users find more ways to incorporate various sources
   of data from the edge, internet of things, and more. In the continued
   pursuit of more advanced hardware for the AI era, IBM is working across
   its Systems, Research and Watson divisions to take a fresh approach to
   AI, which requires significant changes in the fundamentals of systems
   and computing design.

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is finally here. How far will it go?

   In late 2017, IBM successfully launched the next era of
   high-performance cognitive and AI hardware with the deployment of its
   POWER9 technology in the Summit and Sierra supercomputers, the most
   powerful supercomputers in the world to date. Not to be outdone, IBM
   also launched the next era of constant-encryption mainframes, with the
   popular release of the new z14 enterprise mainframe for the new digital
   economy.

Joint program accelerates EUV mask development for advanced nodes

   For more than a decade, IBM has firmly believed that one of the keys to
   true transistor scaling lies in the adoption of Extreme Ultraviolet
   (EUV) lithography as a critical patterning technique. This belief
   culminated in 2015 with IBM’s announcement of the world’s first
   7-nanometer-node chip, and again in 2017 with the announcement of a 5nm
   node chip. In a single exposure step, EUV can create a high-resolution
   pattern of tens of billions of transistors with one “mask,” which
   today’s more common semiconductor technology can only attain with
   patterning processes with multiple masks and prohibitive complexity.
   Thus, EUV has been critical in enabling scaling for leading-edge logic
   applications at advanced nodes – like 7nm and 5nm. However, almost
   every aspect of EUV technology presents new challenges that have to be
   dealt with in a systematic, collaborative way, and the mask is a
   critical enabling element.

   IBM Research and Photronics, Inc. recently signed a joint research and
   development agreement to develop manufacturing-grade EUV mask processes
   for leading-edge logic applications for 7nm, 5nm nodes, and beyond. EUV
   mask

   Figure 1. A state-of-the-art EUV mask

   High-fidelity challenges, high-fidelity results

   Masks are designed templates that project or reflect light in a
   pre-defined pattern onto a silicon wafer, which is used in conjunction
   with a photo-sensitive film on the wafer to define the circuit designs
   necessary to build a semiconductor device. EUV operates outside the
   visible spectrum at 13.5nm wavelength, much shorter than the deep-UV
   193nm light of prior technologies. Because of this, much higher
   fidelity patterns can be achieved, albeit with new mask materials
   required to capture and create contrast in EUV images. Much like a
   high-definition television allows you to see many more details in the
   picture, blemishes and imperfections are also more noticeable with EUV
   lithography, and they have a disproportionate impact on the ability of
   an EUV mask to uniformly yield the tens of billions of transistors
   designed therein.

     “Photronics’ industry-proven mask making capability and development
     team in the US, together with IBM’s advanced research infrastructure
     and semiconductor technology, form the ideal combination to
     accelerate industry-enabling solutions for EUV.”

   IBM and Photronics aim to address the specific defect challenges of
   yielding EUV masks, namely achieving the required pattern fidelity and
   tolerances to yield 7nm and 5nm devices with EUV, and qualify mask
   repair processes that will correct critical defects captured in the
   mask making process. Through this collaborative effort, IBM has already
   been able to demonstrate yielding baselines for its 7nm and 5nm logic
   processes at its semiconductor research fab in Albany, NY, and
   continues to enable critical process and device learning at advanced
   nodes.

   There is no doubt that further refinements in EUV mask architecture and
   processing will be required to achieve the necessary contrast and
   pattern fidelity for future scaling. With that goal in mind, IBM and
   Photronics will use the multi-year collaboration to define and
   demonstrate the roadmap requirements for EUV masks – a critical element
   to IBM’s semiconductor research for the next decade.

   IBM Research scientists demonstrated that an unsupervised

   streams. When compared to state-of-the-art classical computers, this
   prototype technology is expected to yield 200x improvements in both
   speed and energy efficiency, making it highly suitable for enabling
   ultra-dense, low-power, and massively-parallel computing systems for

Future semiconductor research leadership empowered by design automation

   IBM Research and Synopsys have entered into a joint development

   Automation (EDA) flows. The goal: use software to holistically automate
   the method, evaluation, and assessment – the flow – of the elements
   that go into today’s latest transistors, like our 3D FINFET 7nm chip,
   and beyond. We’ll be able to know about, and act upon nano-scale
   variables in design, materials, and processing techniques across a
   chip’s entire design – preventing costly errors, while optimizing which
   technology path to pursue. And all of this analysis will be done before
   a single wafer is made.

   The IT state-of-the-art 20 years ago was rapidly ending, and we – and I
   mean everyone in the industry that made a device with a chip inside of

   IBM Research's Mesh network alert technology used in new The Weather
   Channel app     Read blog article

IoT Research

   Thousands of new devices come online every day. Scientists in IBM
   Research labs worldwide are working closely with organizations to
   capitalize on the opportunity this presents. We are focused on such key
   industries as manufacturing, buildings, automotive, insurance and
   healthcare as well as novel applications for IoT in areas like
   blockchain, edge computing and security.

Sending weather alerts without connectivity

   Mesh network alerts is a peer-to-peer networking technology created by
   IBM Research that will soon be available via The Weather Channel app.
   The app will provide a mobile method to notify underserved populations
   in developing countries of potential severe weather events or disasters
   -- even when there’s limited Internet connection, or cellular networks
   are disrupted due to an outage. Mesh network alerts work entirely
   within the app, using devices connected to Bluetooth or WiFi to
   communicate with unconnected smartphones nearby, so all citizens can
   prepare for an impending weather event.

   Edge computing gets real

Edge computing gets real

   As millions of devices become connected – from cars to medical
   equipment to wearables – edge computing will transform devices into
   data processing and storage centers capable of handling many of their
   own computing tasks. For edge computing to work, the devices must be
   able to communicate without relying on WiFi or cellular connectivity. A
   team of IBM researchers are exploring the use of peer-to-peer mesh
   networking technology to tackle this challenge, allowing devices to
   communicate directly with each other. The team is working with The
   Weather Company, an IBM Business, to make mesh network technology
   available through The Weather Channel app, ensuring no one misses
   potentially life-saving weather alerts.
