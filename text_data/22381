CNN's Anderson Cooper compares Ukraine controversy to "The Godfather"

   CNN's Anderson Cooper compared the ongoing controversy surrounding
   President Trump and the rough transcript of a call with Ukraine
   president Volodymyr Zelensky to a famous scene from "The Godfather."

   In the rough transcript from a call made in July, Trump repeatedly
   pushed for Zelensky to reopen an investigation of his potential 2020
   rival, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, and asked the
   Ukrainian leader to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and
   Attorney General William Barr on the issue.

   Cooper compared Giuliani to Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen, who is
   the godfather's lawyer and consigliere. The specific comparison was
   made to when the godfather, played by Marlon Brando, sends Hagen to Los
   Angeles to persuade the head of a film studio to give his godson a role
   in a movie.

     "I keep coming back to when Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather' sends
     Tom Hagen out to Hollywood to make a deal that the guy can't
     refuse," Cooper said. "What is Giuliani doing running around,
     creeping around Ukraine, to talk to the president of Ukraine about
     allegedly about corruption in Ukraine, which is just a ridiculous
     fig leaf."

   At the end of this scene from "The Godfather," the head of the film
   studio wakes to find the severed head of his prized stallion in his
   bed.

The whistleblower is not currently scheduled to appear before Congress,
source says

   From CNN's Zach Cohen, Pamela Brown and Manu Raju

   The anonymous whistleblower, who filed a complaint with the
   intelligence community inspector general that includes allegations
   about President Trump’s conduct, will not appear before lawmakers
   Thursday, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

   The whistleblower is also not scheduled to appear before Congress, the
   source added.

   The source said that the process is underway to ensure the lawyers have
   access, if needed, to the relevant classified information.

   What we know: The whistleblower has tentatively agreed to meet with
   Congressional lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN.

   The whistleblower will only meet on the condition that Joseph Maguire,
   the acting director of the National Intelligence, approves appropriate
   security clearances for the individual’s legal counsel so that they can
   accompany their client, the correspondence added.

215 House Democrats support an impeachment inquiry into Trump

   SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images

   More than 200 lawmakers — almost entirely Democrats — are calling to
   start an impeachment inquiry, the first step in a lengthy and likely
   divisive process.

   There are at least 215 House Democrats who've made public comments
   advocating at least for starting the impeachment inquiry process,
   according to a CNN count.

   The total number of representatives who have called for an inquiry is
   216. (Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican who has since
   become an independent, has also called for proceedings.)

   What you need to know: The number of House Democrats who at least
   support launching an impeachment inquiry is quickly approaching the 218
   votes needed to impeach Trump in the House, though it is unknown if all
   those who are in favor of an impeachment inquiry will vote to do so.

Whistleblower tentatively agrees to testify, attorneys say

   From CNN's Zach Cohen and Pamela Brown

   The anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint with the intelligence
   community inspector general, which includes allegations about President
   Trump’s conduct, has tentatively agreed to meet with Congressional
   lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN.

   The whistleblower will only meet on the condition that Joseph Maguire,
   the acting director of the National Intelligence, approves appropriate
   security clearances for the individual’s legal counsel so that they can
   accompany their client, the correspondence added.

   House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff wrote a letter
   to Maguire making the request today after the whistleblower’s lawyers
   agreed to meet with lawmakers if that condition is met and requested
   assistance in expediting approval from the acting DNI.

   CNN reported Tuesday that the whistleblower’s legal counsel “wrote to
   the Acting Director of National Intelligence to request specific
   guidance as to the appropriate security practices to permit a meeting,
   if needed, with the Members of the Intelligence Oversight Committees.”
   "“This is a reasonable request that the Committee strongly supports and
   expects your office to fulfill immediately,” Schiff wrote."

   Schiff’s letter comes after the whistleblower’s legal counsel wrote to
   the committee today reiterating the conditions of a possible meeting
   between lawmakers and their client.

     "I am sure you can understand that it is imperative that a
     whistleblower, especially one caught up in such a high profile
     matter involving the President, have experienced legal counsel by
     their side. Your cooperation in ensuring this occurs would help
     facilitate a future meeting or testimony,” the letter said

Reviews of the whistleblower complaint are done for the night

   From CNN's Matthew Hoye

   Senators and House members who had access to the Sensitive
   Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to review the
   whistleblower complaint are finished for the night.

   The complaint has been described by Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley as
   "deeply disturbing." Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, on the other hand,
   has read it and said she did "not support impeachment of President
   Trump."

Why some House Judiciary members want swift action on impeachment

   From CNN's Manu Raju

   Several Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee told CNN they want
   quick action on an articles of impeachment resolution, hoping a vote
   could happen as soon as October.
   "“We gotta move fast,” said Rep. David Cicilline, a committee member."

   The fear, Democrats say, is that the longer the Ukraine controversy
   lingers, the more likely it is to die down — and the public could lose
   interest. Some say that’s what happened with the Mueller report.

   Members of the committee are strategizing with House Speaker Nancy
   Pelosi about the time frame. It’s still unclear how quickly they will
   move because the Ukraine probe, which is being led by the House
   Intelligence Committee, could take time to unearth more documents and
   interview witnesses.

   CNN reported earlier today that Pelosi wants a narrow inquiry focused
   on Ukraine.

     "I have just read the whistleblower complaint made available to

What we know about the whistleblower complaint so far

   From CNN's Manu Raju

   Here’s what we have learned so far about the whistleblower complaint
   from congressional sources:
     * Members have not been told the identity of the whistleblower or
       where the complainant works in the government.
     * The complaint focuses in part on the phone call with the Ukrainian
       president. But sources so far have not shared what more may be

   According to the old rule of thumb, you&#39;re supposed to drink eight
   glasses of water per day (and some experts recommend even more). That
   can seem like a daunting task on some days, but here&#39;s the catch:
   You don&#39;t have to drink all that water. Roughly 20% of our daily
   H2O intake comes from solid foods, especially fruits and
   vegetables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s still important to drink
   plenty of water -- especially in the summertime -- but you can also
   quench your thirst with these 15 hugely hydrating foods, all of which
   are at least 90% water by weight.&lt;br /&gt;

   Sure, you can always reach for a glass of water -- but plain H20 isn't
   the most hydrating beverage around, according to a study from
   Scotland's St. Andrews University that compared the hydration responses
   of several different drinks.

   The researchers found that while water -- both still and sparkling
   --does a pretty good job of quickly hydrating the body, beverages with
   a little bit of sugar, fat or protein do an even better job of keeping
   us hydrated for longer.
   The reason has to do with how our bodies respond to beverages,
   according to Ronald Maughan, a professor at St. Andrews' School of
   Medicine and the study's author. One factor is the volume of a given
   drink: The more you drink, the faster the drink empties from your
   stomach and gets absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can dilute the
   body's fluids and hydrate you.
   The healthiest water to drink: Is there such a thing?

   The healthiest water to drink: Is there such a thing?
   The other factor affecting how well a beverage hydrates relates to a
   drink's nutrient composition. For example, milk was found to be even
   more hydrating than plain water because it contains the sugar lactose,
   some protein and some fat, all of which help to slow the emptying of
   fluid from the stomach and keep hydration happening over a longer
   period of time.

   Milk also has sodium, which acts like a sponge and holds onto water in
   the body and results in less urine produced.
   The same can be said for oral rehydration solutions that are used to
   treat diarrhea. Those contain small amounts of sugar, as well as sodium
   and potassium, which can also help promote water retention in the body.
   The most hydrating beverages, ranked

   The research team at St. Andrews University tested 13 common beverages
   to see how they impact hydration. Here's what they found, ranked from
   most hydrating over a four-hour period to least.

     * Skim milk
     * Oral rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte or Liquid I.V.)
     * Full fat milk
     * Orange juice
     * Cola

     * Cold tea
     * Tea
     * Sports drink
     * Still water
     * Sparkling water
     * Lager
     * Coffee

   "This study tells us much of what we already knew: Electrolytes -- like
   sodium and potassium -- contribute to better hydration, while calories
   in beverages result in slower gastric emptying and therefore slower
   release of urination," said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian,
   personal trainer and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and
   Dietetics who was not involved in the study.

Sugar in moderation

   But here's where it gets tricky: Beverages with more concentrated
   sugars, such as fruit juices or colas, are not necessarily as hydrating
   as their lower-sugar cousins. They may spend a little more time in the
   stomach and empty more slowly compared to plain water, but once these
   beverages enter the small intestine their high concentration of sugars
   gets diluted during a physiological process called osmosis. This
   process in effect "pulls" water from the body into the small intestine
   to dilute the sugars these beverages contain. And technically, anything
   inside the intestine is outside your body.

   Juice and soda are not only less hydrating, but offer extra sugars and
   calories that won't fill us up as much as solid foods, explained
   Majumdar. If the choice is between soda and water for hydration, go
   with water every time. After all, our kidneys and liver depend on water
   to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and water also plays a key role in
   maintaining skin's elasticity and suppleness. It's the cheapest
   moisturizer you'll find.
   While staying hydrated is important -- doing so keeps our joints
   lubricated, helps prevent infections, and carries nutrients to our
   cells -- in most situations people don't need to worry too much about
   how hydrating their beverages are.
   "If you're thirsty, your body will tell you to drink more," Maughan
   said. But for athletes training seriously in warm conditions with high
   sweat losses, or for someone whose cognitive function may be negatively
   impacted by working long hours without beverage breaks, hydration
   becomes a critical issue.

Can beer and lattes keep me hydrated?

   Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which causes you to pass more urine, so
   when it comes to alcoholic beverages hydration will depend on a
   beverage's total volume. "Beer would result in less water loss than
   whiskey, because you are ingesting more fluid with beer," Maughan said.
   "Strong alcoholic drinks will dehydrate, dilute alcoholic drinks will
   not."

   When it comes to coffee, how well your java hydrates you will depend on
   the amount of caffeine you consume. A regular coffee with about 80
   milligrams of caffeine -- roughly what you would find in 12 oz. of
   Folgers' house blend -- would be pretty much as hydrating as water,
   according to Maughan's research.
   Consuming more than 300mg of caffeine, or about 2-4 cups of coffee,
   could cause you to lose excess fluid as the caffeine causes a mild,
   short-term diuretic effect. This is more likely to happen with someone
   who doesn't typically consume caffeine, and it could be offset by
   adding a tablespoon or two of milk to your cup of joe.

   Jupiter&#39;s icy moon Europa may be the best place in the solar system
   to look for extraterrestrial life, according to NASA. The moon is about
   the size of Earth&#39;s moon, and there is evidence it has an ocean
   beneath its frozen crust that may hold twice as much water as Earth.
   NASA&#39;s 2016 budget includes a request for $30 million to plan a

   This nebula, or cloud of gas and dust, is called RCW 34 or Gum 19. The
   brightest areas you can see are where the gas is being heated by young
   stars. Eventually the gas burst outward like champagne after a bottle
   is uncorked. Scientists call this champagne flow. This new image of the
   nebula was captured by the European Space Organization&#39;s Very Large
   Telescope in Chile. RCW 34 is in the constellation Vela in the southern
   sky. The name means &quot;sails of a ship&quot; in Latin.

   The massive crash is located a billion light-years from Earth in the
   SDSS J084905.51+111447.2 system. To see it, astronomers needed to use
   telescopes on the ground and in space.

   The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Telescope in New Mexico imaged the system
   in optical light. Follow-up by citizen scientists involved in the
   Galaxy Zoo project helped tag the system as a galactic collision.
   More detective work ensued. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
   showed glowing infrared light coming from the collision. The Chandra
   X-ray Observatory showcased bright points of light at the center of
   each galaxy. NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array spotted gas
   and dust. Combined, these revealed active, feeding, supermassive black
   holes.

   "We were only looking for pairs of black holes at the time, and yet,
   through our selection technique, we stumbled upon this amazing system,"
   said study author Ryan Pfeifle, a graduate research assistant at George
   Mason University. "This is the strongest evidence yet found for such a
   triple system of actively feeding supermassive black holes."

   Such a massive collision sounds like it would appear more obvious. But
   three supermassive black holes gobbling material in the midst of a
   giant galactic merger creates a lot of gas and dust that can hide the
   event from our telescopes.
   The images and data captured in different wavelengths of light
   eventually provided all of the pieces necessary to reconstructing the
   galactic puzzle.
   "Through the use of these major observatories, we have identified a new
   way of identifying triple supermassive black holes. Each telescope
   gives us a different clue about what's going on in these systems,"
   Pfeifle said. "We hope to extend our work to find more triples using
   the same technique."

   Astronomers witness 'one of the most extraordinary black hole systems'
   Pairs of black holes have been observed before, but not a trio. A pair
   of black holes will merge into a larger one. Three should merge even
   quicker. Previously, astronomers have puzzled over the "final parsec
   problem," where two black holes become close but need another factor to
   overcome their massive energy and actually merge. A third black hole
   could be that factor.

   Another consequence of these merging black holes are gravitational
   waves, or ripples in space and time.
   "Dual and triple black holes are exceedingly rare," said Shobita
   Satyapal, study co-author at George Mason University. "But such systems
   are actually a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, which we think is
   how galaxies grow and evolve."

CNN's Anderson Cooper compares Ukraine controversy to "The Godfather"

   CNN's Anderson Cooper compared the ongoing controversy surrounding
   President Trump and the rough transcript of a call with Ukraine
   president Volodymyr Zelensky to a famous scene from "The Godfather."

   In the rough transcript from a call made in July, Trump repeatedly
   pushed for Zelensky to reopen an investigation of his potential 2020
   rival, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, and asked the
   Ukrainian leader to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and
   Attorney General William Barr on the issue.

   Cooper compared Giuliani to Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen, who is
   the godfather's lawyer and consigliere. The specific comparison was
   made to when the godfather, played by Marlon Brando, sends Hagen to Los
   Angeles to persuade the head of a film studio to give his godson a role
   in a movie.

     "I keep coming back to when Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather' sends
     Tom Hagen out to Hollywood to make a deal that the guy can't
     refuse," Cooper said. "What is Giuliani doing running around,
     creeping around Ukraine, to talk to the president of Ukraine about
     allegedly about corruption in Ukraine, which is just a ridiculous
     fig leaf."

   At the end of this scene from "The Godfather," the head of the film
   studio wakes to find the severed head of his prized stallion in his
   bed.

The whistleblower is not currently scheduled to appear before Congress,
source says

   From CNN's Zach Cohen, Pamela Brown and Manu Raju

   The anonymous whistleblower, who filed a complaint with the
   intelligence community inspector general that includes allegations
   about President Trump’s conduct, will not appear before lawmakers
   Thursday, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

   The whistleblower is also not scheduled to appear before Congress, the
   source added.

   The source said that the process is underway to ensure the lawyers have
   access, if needed, to the relevant classified information.

   What we know: The whistleblower has tentatively agreed to meet with
   Congressional lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN.

   The whistleblower will only meet on the condition that Joseph Maguire,
   the acting director of the National Intelligence, approves appropriate
   security clearances for the individual’s legal counsel so that they can
   accompany their client, the correspondence added.

215 House Democrats support an impeachment inquiry into Trump

   SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images

   More than 200 lawmakers — almost entirely Democrats — are calling to
   start an impeachment inquiry, the first step in a lengthy and likely
   divisive process.

   There are at least 215 House Democrats who've made public comments
   advocating at least for starting the impeachment inquiry process,
   according to a CNN count.

   The total number of representatives who have called for an inquiry is
   216. (Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican who has since
   become an independent, has also called for proceedings.)

   What you need to know: The number of House Democrats who at least
   support launching an impeachment inquiry is quickly approaching the 218
   votes needed to impeach Trump in the House, though it is unknown if all
   those who are in favor of an impeachment inquiry will vote to do so.

Whistleblower tentatively agrees to testify, attorneys say

   From CNN's Zach Cohen and Pamela Brown

   The anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint with the intelligence
   community inspector general, which includes allegations about President
   Trump’s conduct, has tentatively agreed to meet with Congressional
   lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN.

   The whistleblower will only meet on the condition that Joseph Maguire,
   the acting director of the National Intelligence, approves appropriate
   security clearances for the individual’s legal counsel so that they can
   accompany their client, the correspondence added.

   House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff wrote a letter
   to Maguire making the request today after the whistleblower’s lawyers
   agreed to meet with lawmakers if that condition is met and requested
   assistance in expediting approval from the acting DNI.

   CNN reported Tuesday that the whistleblower’s legal counsel “wrote to
   the Acting Director of National Intelligence to request specific
   guidance as to the appropriate security practices to permit a meeting,
   if needed, with the Members of the Intelligence Oversight Committees.”
   "“This is a reasonable request that the Committee strongly supports and
   expects your office to fulfill immediately,” Schiff wrote."

   Schiff’s letter comes after the whistleblower’s legal counsel wrote to
   the committee today reiterating the conditions of a possible meeting
   between lawmakers and their client.

     "I am sure you can understand that it is imperative that a
     whistleblower, especially one caught up in such a high profile
     matter involving the President, have experienced legal counsel by
     their side. Your cooperation in ensuring this occurs would help
     facilitate a future meeting or testimony,” the letter said

Reviews of the whistleblower complaint are done for the night

   From CNN's Matthew Hoye

   Senators and House members who had access to the Sensitive
   Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to review the
   whistleblower complaint are finished for the night.

   The complaint has been described by Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley as
   "deeply disturbing." Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, on the other hand,
   has read it and said she did "not support impeachment of President
   Trump."

Why some House Judiciary members want swift action on impeachment

   From CNN's Manu Raju

   Several Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee told CNN they want
   quick action on an articles of impeachment resolution, hoping a vote
   could happen as soon as October.
   "“We gotta move fast,” said Rep. David Cicilline, a committee member."

   The fear, Democrats say, is that the longer the Ukraine controversy
   lingers, the more likely it is to die down — and the public could lose
   interest. Some say that’s what happened with the Mueller report.

   Members of the committee are strategizing with House Speaker Nancy
   Pelosi about the time frame. It’s still unclear how quickly they will
   move because the Ukraine probe, which is being led by the House
   Intelligence Committee, could take time to unearth more documents and
   interview witnesses.

   CNN reported earlier today that Pelosi wants a narrow inquiry focused
   on Ukraine.

   Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, said she has read the
   whistleblower complaint and does "not support impeachment of President
   Trump."

     "I have just read the whistleblower complaint made available to
     House Intelligence Committee Members. I believe strongly in
     transparency and it should be immediately declassified and made
     public for the American people to read," she tweeted this evening.

What we know about the whistleblower complaint so far

   From CNN's Manu Raju

   Here’s what we have learned so far about the whistleblower complaint
   from congressional sources:
     * Members have not been told the identity of the whistleblower or
       where the complainant works in the government.
     * The complaint focuses in part on the phone call with the Ukrainian
       president. But sources so far have not shared what more may be
       contained in the still classified report.
     * Rep. Eric Swalwell disclosed that the whistleblower points to
       witnesses and other documents in the report. Swalwell described
       them as new leads that need to be investigated by lawmakers.
     * Rep. Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah, said he has “no
       concerns” about what he read in the complaint.

   According to the old rule of thumb, you&#39;re supposed to drink eight
   glasses of water per day (and some experts recommend even more). That
   can seem like a daunting task on some days, but here&#39;s the catch:
   You don&#39;t have to drink all that water. Roughly 20% of our daily
   H2O intake comes from solid foods, especially fruits and
   vegetables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s still important to drink
   plenty of water -- especially in the summertime -- but you can also
   quench your thirst with these 15 hugely hydrating foods, all of which
   are at least 90% water by weight.&lt;br /&gt;

   Water content: 94.5%
   Sliced and diced tomatoes will always be a mainstay of salads, sauces
   and sandwiches, but don't forget about sweet cherry and grape
   varieties, which make an excellent hydrating snack, Gans says. "They're
   great to just pop in your mouth, maybe with some nuts or some
   low-sodium cheese," she says. "You get this great explosion of flavor
   when you bite into them."

   Sure, you can always reach for a glass of water -- but plain H20 isn't
   the most hydrating beverage around, according to a study from
   Scotland's St. Andrews University that compared the hydration responses
   of several different drinks.

   The researchers found that while water -- both still and sparkling
   --does a pretty good job of quickly hydrating the body, beverages with
   a little bit of sugar, fat or protein do an even better job of keeping
   us hydrated for longer.
   The reason has to do with how our bodies respond to beverages,
   according to Ronald Maughan, a professor at St. Andrews' School of
   Medicine and the study's author. One factor is the volume of a given
   drink: The more you drink, the faster the drink empties from your
   stomach and gets absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can dilute the
   body's fluids and hydrate you.
   The healthiest water to drink: Is there such a thing?

   The healthiest water to drink: Is there such a thing?
   The other factor affecting how well a beverage hydrates relates to a
   drink's nutrient composition. For example, milk was found to be even
   more hydrating than plain water because it contains the sugar lactose,
   some protein and some fat, all of which help to slow the emptying of
   fluid from the stomach and keep hydration happening over a longer
   period of time.

   Milk also has sodium, which acts like a sponge and holds onto water in
   the body and results in less urine produced.
   The same can be said for oral rehydration solutions that are used to
   treat diarrhea. Those contain small amounts of sugar, as well as sodium
   and potassium, which can also help promote water retention in the body.
   The most hydrating beverages, ranked

   The research team at St. Andrews University tested 13 common beverages
   to see how they impact hydration. Here's what they found, ranked from
   most hydrating over a four-hour period to least.

     * Skim milk
     * Oral rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte or Liquid I.V.)
     * Full fat milk
     * Orange juice

   "This study tells us much of what we already knew: Electrolytes -- like
   sodium and potassium -- contribute to better hydration, while calories
   in beverages result in slower gastric emptying and therefore slower
   release of urination," said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian,
   personal trainer and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and
   Dietetics who was not involved in the study.

Sugar in moderation

   But here's where it gets tricky: Beverages with more concentrated
   sugars, such as fruit juices or colas, are not necessarily as hydrating
   as their lower-sugar cousins. They may spend a little more time in the
   stomach and empty more slowly compared to plain water, but once these
   beverages enter the small intestine their high concentration of sugars
   gets diluted during a physiological process called osmosis. This
   process in effect "pulls" water from the body into the small intestine
   to dilute the sugars these beverages contain. And technically, anything
   inside the intestine is outside your body.

   Majumdar. If the choice is between soda and water for hydration, go
   with water every time. After all, our kidneys and liver depend on water
   to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and water also plays a key role in
   maintaining skin's elasticity and suppleness. It's the cheapest
   moisturizer you'll find.
   While staying hydrated is important -- doing so keeps our joints
   lubricated, helps prevent infections, and carries nutrients to our
   cells -- in most situations people don't need to worry too much about
   how hydrating their beverages are.
   "If you're thirsty, your body will tell you to drink more," Maughan
   said. But for athletes training seriously in warm conditions with high
   sweat losses, or for someone whose cognitive function may be negatively
   impacted by working long hours without beverage breaks, hydration
   becomes a critical issue.

Can beer and lattes keep me hydrated?

   Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which causes you to pass more urine, so
   when it comes to alcoholic beverages hydration will depend on a
   beverage's total volume. "Beer would result in less water loss than
   whiskey, because you are ingesting more fluid with beer," Maughan said.
   "Strong alcoholic drinks will dehydrate, dilute alcoholic drinks will
   not."

   When it comes to coffee, how well your java hydrates you will depend on
   the amount of caffeine you consume. A regular coffee with about 80
   milligrams of caffeine -- roughly what you would find in 12 oz. of
   Folgers' house blend -- would be pretty much as hydrating as water,
   according to Maughan's research.
   Consuming more than 300mg of caffeine, or about 2-4 cups of coffee,
   could cause you to lose excess fluid as the caffeine causes a mild,
   short-term diuretic effect. This is more likely to happen with someone
   who doesn't typically consume caffeine, and it could be offset by
   adding a tablespoon or two of milk to your cup of joe.

   (CNN)When galaxies collide, so do the supermassive black holes at the
   center of each galaxy. For the first time, astronomers have observed a
   triple collision of galaxies, which have sent their black holes on a

   A collision of three galaxies has set three supermassive black holes on
   a crash course with each other in a system one billion light-years from
   Earth. A collision of three galaxies has set three supermassive black

   The massive crash is located a billion light-years from Earth in the
   SDSS J084905.51+111447.2 system. To see it, astronomers needed to use
   telescopes on the ground and in space.

   The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Telescope in New Mexico imaged the system
   in optical light. Follow-up by citizen scientists involved in the
   Galaxy Zoo project helped tag the system as a galactic collision.
   More detective work ensued. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
   showed glowing infrared light coming from the collision. The Chandra
   X-ray Observatory showcased bright points of light at the center of
   each galaxy. NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array spotted gas
   and dust. Combined, these revealed active, feeding, supermassive black
   holes.

   "We were only looking for pairs of black holes at the time, and yet,
   through our selection technique, we stumbled upon this amazing system,"
   said study author Ryan Pfeifle, a graduate research assistant at George
   Mason University. "This is the strongest evidence yet found for such a
   triple system of actively feeding supermassive black holes."

   Such a massive collision sounds like it would appear more obvious. But
   three supermassive black holes gobbling material in the midst of a
   giant galactic merger creates a lot of gas and dust that can hide the
   event from our telescopes.
   The images and data captured in different wavelengths of light
   eventually provided all of the pieces necessary to reconstructing the
   galactic puzzle.
   "Through the use of these major observatories, we have identified a new
   way of identifying triple supermassive black holes. Each telescope
   gives us a different clue about what's going on in these systems,"
   Pfeifle said. "We hope to extend our work to find more triples using
   the same technique."

   Astronomers witness 'one of the most extraordinary black hole systems'
   Pairs of black holes have been observed before, but not a trio. A pair
   of black holes will merge into a larger one. Three should merge even
   quicker. Previously, astronomers have puzzled over the "final parsec
   problem," where two black holes become close but need another factor to
   overcome their massive energy and actually merge. A third black hole
   could be that factor.

   Another consequence of these merging black holes are gravitational
   waves, or ripples in space and time.
   "Dual and triple black holes are exceedingly rare," said Shobita
   Satyapal, study co-author at George Mason University. "But such systems
   are actually a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, which we think is
   how galaxies grow and evolve."

   (CNN)Talk about bad timing.
   A Tesla electric police patrol car in the Bay Area ran low on power at
   one of the worst possible times last Friday -- during a pursuit.
   It's unclear exactly why the 2014 Tesla Model S 85 wasn't fully charged
   and lost juice at such an inopportune moment, according to Fremont
   Police Department's spokesperson, Geneva Bosques.

   "It happens from time to time, especially if an officer returns to the
   station to take a report and then they never go back out in the
   street," she told CNN.
   The police officer driving the Tesla was pursuing a suspect who was
   wanted in connection with a crime in Santa Clara, according to Bosques.
   After confirming the license plate, the officer attempted a traffic
   stop, the car failed to yield and the driver took off at a high rate of
   speed, she said.

   "Just realized I am down to six miles of battery on the Tesla, so I may
   lose it here in a sec," the officer driving the Tesla said, according
   to Fremont Police dispatch audio obtained via Broadcastify.
   Other police units were following behind to assist and ultimately took
   over the pursuit with help from California State Highway Patrol,
   according to Bosques. She said the chase was called off after 10
   minutes when it was deemed unsafe because of the way the suspect was
   driving.
   California State Highway Patrol later found the suspect's car abandoned
   in San Jose.
   Fremont Police said they are still in their 6 months of a pilot program
   testing the integration of the Tesla with the department and that they
   are keeping track of all the data.

   "We have no written policy regarding gas or charging, but the general
   guideline is that it should at least be half full at the beginning of
   the shift, which this car was," Bosques said.
   Bosques said last week's incident doesn't change the way the department
   feels about the performance of the car for patrol purposes.

   CNN's Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.

   (CNN)The British Parliament has been back in business for less than a
   day and already the Brexit debate has reached a new and dizzying level
   of bizarreness.
   On Wednesday evening amid ugly scenes in the House of Commons, a
   combative Boris Johnson took the extraordinary step of daring Jeremy
   Corbyn, the leader of the official opposition, to call a vote of no
   confidence in the government he leads. Parliament was "paralyzed," the
   Prime Minister argued. "This Parliament must either stand aside and let
   this government get Brexit done, or bring a vote of confidence and
   finally face the day of reckoning with the voters," he said.
   Corbyn declined Johnson's kind offer. "I thank the Prime Minister for
   an advance copy of his statement," he told lawmakers. "Unfortunately,
   it was like his illegal shutting down of Parliament -- null, of no
   effect, and should be quashed, in the words of the Supreme Court."

   To people looking on from the UK and around the world, it all must have
   looked completely topsy-turvy. Johnson says he wants an election, but
   can't make it happen. The opposition claims it wants an election, but
   won't make it happen. British politics is in a deeply weird place. The
   government and the opposition each hold the keys to giving the other
   what they want, but neither wants to be the one to release the lock.

   Johnson is leading a minority government and wants an early general
   election as soon as possible. In order to get one, he needs the country
   to believe he is fighting tooth and nail to get Brexit over the line,
   once and for all. Corbyn and the rest of the opposition are frustrating
   his efforts at every turn. That's the message he is hammering home,
   over and over.

   If the polls are to be believed, it's a narrative that's working in his
   favor.
   Labour and the rest of Johnson's opponents, however, only want an
   election after they can be absolutely sure that the looming October 31
   Brexit deadline has been neutered. Only a delay, they argue, would
   prevent a no-deal Brexit which they believe would cause economic havoc,
   and even put lives at risk.

   Doubtless, they are sincere in this argument. However, it's hard to
   ignore the idea floated in some corners that if Brexit is delayed,
   Johnson would have failed to deliver his central promise and his poll
   numbers would collapse. A clearer path to power, therefore, would
   emerge for Labour and the other UK opposition parties.
   That's why Corbyn may not bring forward a confidence vote now, but
   instead continue to pile political pressure on the Prime Minister to
   resign. If the Labour leader can force that scenario, someone else
   would be forced to ask Brussels for a Brexit extension and Johnson
   would be cast as an abject failure who quit when the going got tough.
   All of which would presumably work to the electoral advantage of one
   Jeremy Corbyn.
   Johnson and Corbyn, it seems, are trying to trick the other into acting
   against their own interest. The politics of the UK have seldom been
   this baffling.
   It's hard to see that this will lead to anything other than a
   monumental grudge match. We got a taste of it on Wednesday -- the
   exchanges in the Commons were among the angriest and most bitter in
   years.
   Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, said Parliament was "dead" and "no
   moral right" to sit. Johnson, later, peppered his remarks with the
   people-versus-parliament rhetoric of "surrender" and "betrayal" that
   has become his trademark.
   In response to calls from Labour MPs to moderate his tone and reflect
   on the politically motivated murder three years ago of lawmaker Jo Cox,
   Johnson said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory is to get Brexit
   done." Even some Conservative MPs were aghast that the Prime Minister
   would use the horror to make a political point.

   But don't expect him to back down. Johnson thinks it will work, and
   there will be more to come.
   Parliament is back -- and angrier than ever. The next few weeks will
   get even uglier.

   London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing pressure over his
   alleged relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
   during the time he served as the Mayor of London.
   Johnson has been given 14 days to provide the details of the
   relationship after the Sunday Times reported that a company run by the
   tech entrepreneur received tens of thousands of pounds in public
   funding when Johnson was mayor.

   conference in London in 2014.

   The company also had access to overseas trade missions headed by the
   then mayor, according to the newspaper. The Sunday Times alleged Arcuri
   was given preferential treatment when it came to joining the missions,
   despite her business "not meeting the eligibility criteria for any of
   the three Johnson trade missions she attended in the space of just a
   year."

   The Oversight Committee of the Greater London Authority has asked
   Johnson to disclose details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri
   during his 2008-16 mayoral term. They also want the PM to explain how
   that alleged personal relationship was disclosed at the time Arcuri was
   awarded the grants.
   Arcuri and her company did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
   She told the Sunday Times any grants received and any trade mission I
   joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate
   businesswoman."

   Downing Street declined to comment on the allegations. Johnson himself
   first dodged the topic, then suggested in a BBC interview everything
   was done "entirely in the proper way."
   The issue was even discussed in Parliament on Wednesday, when lawmakers
   forced an official from the government's Department for Digital,
   Culture, Media and Sport to come into the debating chamber and answer
   questions about his agencies role in awarding Arcuri's company their
   most recent public money.
   Arcuri's latest company, Hacker House, was awarded £100,000 ($123,000)
   funding earlier this year from the department. The company says it
   provides "practical ethical hacking skills" training online. The
   funding was part of a program aiming to increase the diversity and
   numbers of those working in the UK's cyber security sector.
   Questioned about a possible conflict of interest, Matt Warman, the
   undersecretary of state for digital, said all grants are awarded
   through transparent and competitive way. He added the company has been
   paid "some £47,000" to date.
   "We are of course aware of the claims raised recently by The Sunday
   Times and the department is reviewing the decision that was taken," he
   said.

   Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran alleged in Parliament that the funding
   was meant for businesses based in the UK, and added that Arcuri lives
   in the US.
   Warman said the company's location will be part of the review. "But it
   is a company with a British phone number," he said, adding that Johnson
   was not involved in the decision to award the grant.
   Moran also said the funding the company received was higher than what
   it was eligible for, saying the grant was set at maximum of 50% of a
   company's income. Warman said the officials scored the application
   highly and "decided the other aspects more than outweighed that
   particular individual criteria."

   The company's registered address in central London is a building that
   houses offices for rent, as well as "virtual offices," a service that
   makes it possible for businesses to have a physical presence in London
   without any actual space or desks. It is not clear if Hacker House uses
   that service.
   Hacker House was not immediately available to comment. The company did
   not respond to email and voice mail.

Pompeo declares 'productive week' on Iran as Rouhani dismisses US-Iran talks

   By Nicole Gaouette and Jennifer Hansler, CNN

   ____________________

   New York (CNN)Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States had
   "a productive week" of discussion with allies on Iran and suggested the
   US remained open to negotiations with the nation, despite Iranian
   President Hassan Rouhani hours earlier squashing any prospects of a
   meeting with his US counterpart.
   "We want peace, we want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic
   of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end it'll be up to
   the Iranians to make that decision," Pompeo said Wednesday in a news
   conference alongside President Donald Trump. "We hope we can get the
   opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for
   both them, for the United States to make sure they never have a nuclear
   weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles
   and in the way they have all around the world."
   "And I thought we made real progress uniting the world on that here
   over the past few days," Pompeo added.

   However, just hours earlier, Rouhani declared that negotiations can't
   take place until sanctions are lifted -- a step the US not only refuses
   to take, but doubled down on earlier in the day by announcing new
   penalties.
   "On behalf of my nation and state, I would like to announce that our
   response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative," Rouhani said
   Wednesday in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.

Travel restrictions

   Shortly after Pompeo voiced the US desire for peace, the White House
   announced sweeping visa restrictions on senior Iranian officials and
   their immediate families. Citing Iranian behavior that "threatens peace
   and stability in the Middle East and beyond," Trump wrote in a
   presidential proclamation, "I have determined that it is in the
   interest of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend
   the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
   senior government officials of Iran, and their immediate family
   members."
   The proclamation notes that there would be exceptions in accordance
   with "United States Government obligations under applicable
   international agreements."
   Ahead of the General Assembly, Iran accused the US of slow walking
   visas for its official delegation. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad
   Javad Zarif was already subject to visa restrictions due to earlier US
   sanctions.

'Edge of collapse'

   In his general assembly speech, Rouhani spoke of the precarious
   situation in the region and issued a warning.
   "Our region is on the edge of collapse," Rouhani said, "as a single
   blunder can fuel a big fire. We shall not tolerate the provocative
   intervention of foreigners. We shall respond decisively and strongly to
   any sort of transgression to and violation of our security and
   territorial integrity."
   He decried the US presence in the Middle East and American efforts to
   create an international maritime security force in the Persian Gulf.
   Urging countries in the region to work together, he said the issues
   facing Iran and its neighbors are too big and important for Washington
   to solve.
   Rouhani spoke as Trump has been signaling his interest in starting
   talks with Tehran, but the European Union warned the Iran nuclear deal
   is increasingly under pressure and US allies, particularly French
   President Emmanuelle Macron, are pushing the two sides to begin a
   dialogue.

   In his own address to the UN General Assembly Tuesday, Trump noted that
   that many of America's "greatest friends" used to be enemies. "The
   United States has never believed in permanent enemies," Trump told the
   audience.
   Later in the day, Trump told reporters that meeting with Iran made
   sense. "They're here. We're here ... it certainly makes sense, but we
   haven't agreed to that yet."
   For a second day Wednesday, tensions in the Persian Gulf were
   overshadowed by the day's dominating news of Trump's request that
   Ukraine investigate his chief political rival at the moment, former
   Vice President Joe Biden, and the House of Representatives decision to
   launch an impeachment inquiry.

'The harshest sanctions'

   In his remarks, the Iranian leader condemned the Trump administration's
   "maximum pressure" campaign and the impact on Iranian people. He called
   on the US to return to the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the
   Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that the US exited in May 2018.
   "The government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against the
   harshest sanctions in the past one and a half years and will never
   negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the
   weapon of poverty, pressure and sanctions," Rouhani said. "The only way
   for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance. If you
   are sensitive to the name of JCPOA, then, well, you can return to its
   framework."
   Rouhani laid out his conditions not long after Pompeo announced new
   Iran-related sanctions on Chinese companies transporting oil from Iran
   and their executive officers.
   "We're telling China and all nations, know that we will sanction every
   violation of sanctionable activity," Pompeo said at a conference
   organized by the group United Against Nuclear Iran.
   Pompeo also said the US was "taking new action to disentangle" Iran's
   Revolutionary Guard Corps "from the Iranian economy."
   "The United States will intensify our efforts to educate countries and
   companies on the risk of doing business with IRGC entities and we will
   punish them if they persist in defiance of our warnings," he said.
   The Treasury Department said in a release that based on a determination
   by Pompeo it would sanction COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co. and
   COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co., along with
   a few other companies and a slew of individuals.
   The Trump administration has steadily ratcheted up economic pressure on
   Iran since leaving the 2015 international pact that constrained its
   nuclear program in exchange for economic relief. Those penalties now
   cover all essential pillars of the economy, including its central bank
   and sovereign wealth fund.
   The US says its goal is to get Iran back to the table to renegotiate
   the nuclear deal to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its
   activities in the Middle East.
   But Tehran has pushed back.
   The US has blamed Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf
   and for the devastating strike on a Saudi Aramco facility that American
   officials say was conducted by drone and missile. Germany, France and
   the UK have also said Iran bears responsibility. Yemen-based Houthi
   rebels have claimed the attack was their doing.
   On Wednesday, Rouhani argued that the US was not capable of being a
   stabilizing force in the region and called for regional countries to
   band together to join an Iranian maritime security initiative he called
   the "Coalition for Hope."

'Coalition for hope'

   With such a maritime group, "the free flow of oil and other energy
   resources could be guaranteed, provided that we consider security as an
   umbrella in all areas for all the countries," Rouhani said.
   In contrast, Rouhani said the US effort to organize an international
   force to patrol the Persian Gulf "is a clear example of interference in
   the affairs of the region. The securitization of navigation"
   contravenes the right to free navigation and would escalate tensions,
   and increase "mistrust in the region while jeopardizing regional peace,
   security and stability."
   The Iranian leader also argued that security will come to the region
   "when American troops pull out." Calling on "neighbors" to work
   together, Rouhani said that, "security shall not be supplied with
   American weapons and intervention."
   "The United States has failed to resolve the issue in Afghanistan, Iraq
   and Syria," Rouhani said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. "Such a
   government is clearly unable to resolve more sophisticated issues."

'Increasingly difficult'

   Iran continued to comply with the nuclear deal for more than a year
   after the US began its sanctions push, until recently, when it has
   begun violating some of its terms.

   Speaking to media outside the UN General Assembly hall, EU Foreign
   Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said it's becoming harder to preserve
   the nuclear deal. "I will not hide that is increasingly difficult to do
   it and we have discussed today that fact that we will try to continue
   keeping the agreement in place and overcome the difficulties that we're
   facing," she said.
   "What I believe is that every step that has been taken so far by Iran,
   and I underline, so far, is reversible," Mogherini added. "We have
   constantly called upon Iran to reverse these decisions and go back to
   full compliance, which has been the case till recently because this is
   in the interests of all."

   How #MeToo spread from Hollywood to the high court (2018) 03:31

   Paris (CNN)A court in Paris has ordered the founder of France's #MeToo
   movement to pay thousands of euros in damages for defaming a man by
   accusing him of making lewd comments about her.
   In October 2017, French journalist Sandra Muller accused television
   producer Eric Brion of making the comments about her at a party and
   shared the details on Twitter, using the hashtag #balancetonporc, which
   roughly translates to "squeal on your pig."
   Ultimately, her story inspired thousands of others to share their
   experiences of sexual harassment and assault, catapulting France's
   national discourse on sexualized violence into the global spotlight.

   French journalist Sandra Muller was ordered to to pay thousands of
   euros for defaming a man on social media.

   On Wednesday a French court ordered Muller to pay €15,000 ($16,500) in
   damages to Brion, as well as €5,000 ($5,500) of legal fees, Muller's
   lawyer confirmed to CNN.
   She has also been ordered to delete the tweeted comments and to share
   the court's statements on her account, according to the Agence
   France-Presse (AFP) news agency.

   In June, Brion acknowledged to the court that he made the inappropriate
   remarks, but said he apologized for them by text message the day after.

   He said he did not receive a response to his apology and that "Muller's
   violence against me has never stopped. The violence of people hiding
   behind their phones."
   His lawyer, Marie Burguburu, previously told CNN that while he admitted
   to the comment, the reason they were filing a defamation suit was
   because Muller had accused him of "sexual harassment at work" on
   Twitter.
   While he has said that he regretted his words, Brion previously noted
   in Le Monde that he would rather have been tried in a court of justice
   than in the court of social media.
   Muller told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the verdict that the sentence was
   "disappointing" and that she will "keep fighting every day."
   "This decision does not mean women have to stop talking. Women have to
   keep expressing themselves, women have to continue denouncing
   reprehensible behaviors -- all of them," she said. "Fear must not win."
   Critics of the ruling were quick to point out the absurdity of the
   case, and how Muller's efforts to expose sexual harassment resulted in
   her having to pay out.
   Marie Laguerre, whose violent assault in Paris in 2018 went viral after
   it was captured on video, told CNN: "I am angry! This ruling sends a
   clear message: it's better to keep quiet. And, the reputation of a man
   is worth more than the body of a woman.

   "Sandra is paying the price for having broken her silence and paving
   the way for many other women to do the same," Laguerre said.
   Meanwhile, Muller's lawyer, Francis Szpiner, tweeted that that they
   would be appealing the court's decision.
