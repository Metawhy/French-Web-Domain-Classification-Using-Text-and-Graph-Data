Spreading Knowledge

   Connie Keller, local APQS rep and UNT Fiber Art professor, asked
   several quilters to speak to her fiber art students yesterday.

   Maria quilts for the public so she didn't have big samples to show. All
   of her best work goes home with her clients.

   In addition to her unique collage style, Deborah talked about her book
   and teaching.
   [IMG_2730.jpg]
   [IMG_2736.jpg]
   I talked about the different surface techniques I use and how I create
   images with fabric and thread. It's always scary for me to talk to a
   crowd but the students were interested and welcoming, and asked good
   questions.

Bird Quilt Challenge

   The Denton Quilt Guild has issued a challenge to make a 15" square
   quilt with the theme "Birds'. I found this great photo by my friend
   Thomas Judd and asked him if I could base my quilt on his image.
   [Sandhill%2B15578440_1372618222769126_3500929042084354407_n.jpeg]
   I fused the background fabrics to batting and quilted it. I painted the
   cranes with acrylic ink on PDF muslin. When they were dry I ironed
   Wonder Under to the back and cut them out. After I fused the birds to
   the background, I added the reflections with fabric market and fused
   fabric. I quilted the cranes and the reflections. I fused the binding
   to the quilt and added embroidery stitches to the binding.

Dallas Quilt Show 2017

   [IMG_1273.jpg]
   I had a wonderful time at the Dallas Quilt Show last weekend. I'm on
   the show committee as the printed materials chair, so I work on the
   show just about year round. It's so nice to see all our plans come
   together.
   The judges liked several of my entries which added to the fun and
   excitement. My "Home Dream Home" challenge block won the first place
   ribbon.
   [IMG_1008.jpg]
   The block is 10 x 10".
   "Dr. Lizard" was awarded the Third Place ribbon in the Small
   Contemporary category.
   [Dr.%2BLizard.jpg]
   He's small. 20 x 17".
   "Dad's Blue Truck" won an honorable mention in the Pictorial category.
   [IMG_1252.jpg]
   40 x 35".
   I entered "Chrysalis" in the Art Quilt category.
   [IMG_1042.jpg]
   33 x 43".
   "Dragonfly Dance" was in Small Contemporary.
   [Littmann_T_Dragonfly_Dance.jpg]
   14 x 18".
   This quilt from 2000 called "Berek at the Koi Pond" hung in the special
   exhibit called "In The  Beginning." The exhibit was made up of early
   guild members. I joined the Quilter's Guild of Dallas in 1988.

   After several days of immersion in everything QUILT,
   I'm inspired and anxious to get busy making something new.

Coffee Memories for Grace Johnson

   [IMG_8195.jpg]
   When I painted the coffee cups in Judy Coates Perez’s acrylic ink class
   at International Quilt Festival 2015 in Houston I knew I would make an
   art quilt for my long-time coffee buddy, Grace Johnson’s birthday.
   [IMG_8208.jpg]
   Judy had us make 10 different background samples in the morning. The
   background of the cups was sea sponge-painted with several colors of
   acrylic ink. When the sponge paint was dry, I cut coffee cup shapes out
   of freezer paper and ironed them onto the fabric as a resist. I
   dry-brushed blue ink off of the edges of the cups to create the blue
   background. I added the brown coffee with a second freezer paper
   stencil and some fabric markers.
   [IMG_8496.jpg]
   I added borders of my own hand-dyed, and some commercial hand-dyed
   fabric.
   [IMG_9986.jpg]
   [IMG_0345.JPG]
   I added rice stitches around the cups and an arch to represent morning
   with embroidery floss.
   [IMG_0344.JPG]
   I drew the spoon with silver Sharpie and Tsukineko white ink. I sewed
   clear beads spilling from the spoon to represent sugar.
   When Grace announced that she would be moving to Tulsa to be near her
   family I realized we had been having coffee together for 19 years.
   [IMG_0343.JPG]
   So I glued and stitched down 19 coffee beans.

   Grace, I look forward to visiting your new home in Tulsa!

Sweet Gum Ball Challenge

   Members of the Not Your Grandmother's Bee were challenged to create
   something inpsired by a sweet gum tree seed pod.
   [FullSizeRender.jpeg]
   [IMG_9422.jpg]
   This is my "Blue Bommy Knocker."
   The name comes from a children's book "The Hungry Giant's Soup" by Joy
   Cowley where the "bommy-knocker" is a spiked club that is the giant's
   weapon of choice.
