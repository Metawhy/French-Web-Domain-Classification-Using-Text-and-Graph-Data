My Top Five Podcasts — and a Reader Wildcard

   By Kim Rhodes

   Six Great Podcasts

   I’m the podcast person in the group… any group. (Is it possible to be
   podcast-ish, like a person is bookish?) Whatever the equivalent, I am
   that. Podcasts are an essential part of my day — I listen on commutes,
   I listen at a restaurant waiting for a date to arrive, I listen in line
   at Trader Joe’s. Here are my five favorites, plus a recommendation I
   took from the Cup of Jo reader comments…

A Trick for Making Decisions

   By Caroline Donofrio

   A Trick for Making Decisions

   My friend Brenda is, quite possibly, a psychic genius. She has a knack
   for calling at just the right moment with just the right words. A
   therapist by trade, her guidance is always remarkably sound. A few
   weeks ago, we were catching up when she dropped another truth bomb…

Soft Sweaters for Fall Days

   By Joanna Goddard

   Garnet Hill cashmere sweaters

   What do you like most about fall? Though I’m partial to walking over
   crunchy leaves and the wacky Halloween decorations of our neighbors,
   I’d have to say that my favorite part of fall is the coziness. There’s
   more time to slow down, read books and cuddle up, and on that note,
   here are some super soft Garnet Hill sweaters…

Happy Menocal’s Apartment Has Surprises Around Every Corner

   By Joanna Goddard

   Happy Menocal House Tour

   Happy Menocal — a designer, painter, and the creative director of Happy
   Menocal Studio — lives with her husband, John, and two kids in Park
   Slope, Brooklyn. “The building was originally a mechanic’s garage that
   repaired pieces of cruise ships,” she says. “I’m glad that we renovated
   it before Pinterest — I wasn’t so overwhelmed by all the choices. I
   just looked at some magazines!” Here’s a peek inside…

Have a Lovely Weekend.

   By Joanna Goddard

   pizza by christine han

   What are you up to this weekend? We’re having friends over for dinner,
   and they’re bringing churros and chocolate for dessert. (Score.) Hope
   you have a good one, and here are a few fun links from around the web…

   Have you seen Hustlers? I’ve heard great things and am seeing it
   tonight.

   A supercut of Alex Trebek saying genre, haha.

   What a lovely wedding cake!

   Would you wear blue eyeshadow?

   For school mornings, I’ve been making these easy frittatas in muffin
   tins ahead of time for Toby and Anton to have for breakfast. They’re
   delicious for afternoon snacks, too.

   I am “why do I need Venmo?” years old. Made me laugh.

   What a beautiful candle.

   Found! The fastest way to board an airplane.

   How to make work trips a little easier. “Send selfie videos. Because
   your kids – and your spouse – miss you. And a five-second video of you
   standing on the airport’s moving walkway while making silly faces will
   delight them infinitely more than a photo or phone call will.”

   America’s 10 best new restaurants. (The photos look so delicious.)

   Also, what do you like to wear to work? We’re writing a post about what
   our readers wear to work and we’d love to hear from you. If you’d like,
   please send your look to kim@cupofjo.com. Please include a photo, where
   you live and a couple sentences about your work style. xoxo

   Plus, two reader comments:

   Says Alice on 12 questions to ask your significant other at dinner: we
   recently instated a date rule that if we want to talk about work, we
   have to touch our nose the whole time. Just goofy and annoying enough
   to encourage us talk about the truly important things, like:
   – if you had to eat the same meal once a day every day, what would it
   be?
   – what movie could you happily watch once a week for the rest of your
   life?
   and, if you’re feeling brave, the nearly marriage-ending
   – what is closer to a fry, a sweet potato fry or a tater tot?”

   Says Emma on burning questions about food: “To take care of food waste,
   we have ‘Tiny Bites’ once a week. The idea is a plate full of any
   leftovers. Favorites include: halved meatballs, three carrot sticks, a
   dollop of hummus, apple slices, a pile of peas, cubed cheese, raisins
   no one ate from their lunch, yogurt with leftover herbs, bits of chips
   from the bottom of the bag… Arrange it all together on a plate and it
   even looks a little fancy.”

   Kottke.)

Four Fun Things

   By Joanna Goddard

   andrew scott in talented mr ripley

   BREAKING NEWS from the Hollywood Reporter: Andrew Scott — our dearly
   beloved “hot priest” — will be starring in a Talented Mr. Ripley series
   on Showtime. Both the book and movie were fantastic, so I’ll be over
   here casually counting the days until the show comes out. — Joanna

   family dinner around the world

   Did you see the fascinating New York Times Weeknight Dinner Around the
   World story? They photographed eighteen families — from Thailand to
   France to South Africa — sitting down together at the end of the day.
   But like all the best dinners, it’s not only about the food — it’s
   about the soccer game on TV in the background in Saudi Arabia, and the
   kid climbing on the kitchen counter in Western Australia, and the dog
   that lingers next to the table hoping for scraps in Mexico, and the man
   leading a prayer while holding the challah in Israel. I want to eat
   every dish. — Jenny

   How to nurse your baby in public. Made me laugh and is so good and
   perfect. — Joanna

   shopbop discount code

   Head’s up: Shopbop’s huge fall sale is happening right now, with
   everything up to 25% off. A few pretty pieces that would work well for
   work/weekend uniforms: a cozy sweater, a silk skirt, the best jeans,
   sexy underwear and wear-forever booties.

   P.S. More fun things, and 14 things to do with friends other than
   dinner.

Have a Lovely Weekend.

   By Joanna Goddard

   Peaches by Kaitlin Wayne

   What are you up to this weekend? Anton has been getting really into
   riding his bike (he’s his mama’s son!), so we’ll be going on bike rides
   together. Also, bravo for the global climate strike today. We’re
   kicking off a series next week about climate change and would love to
   hear all your thoughts, ideas, strategies, experiences, etc. Have a
   great weekend, and here are a few links from around the web…

   The Downton Abbey movie comes out today!

   The secret to the lightest pancakes.

   Can’t stop looking at these beautiful gardens.

   Loving J.Crew’s fall arrivals, especially this work shirt.

   The correct way to serve grapes.

   How to raise a lifelong reader. “‘When I’m sitting there on my couch,
   reading a book, and my kids are doing their own thing, I like to think,
   ‘I’m parenting right now — they can see me reading this book,’”
   [NYTimes Book Review editor Maria] Russo told me… Parents are
   constantly sending their children messages with how they choose to
   spend their free time.”

   So excited for Alison Roman’s new cookbook.

   Should you mention how tired you are? A flowchart, haha.

   Wow, this pan makes the most beautiful cakes.

   The cutest kids menu, of all things.

   Beyoncé takes her rightful place next to the royals at Madame Tussauds.

   Plus, two reader comments:

   Says Emma on have you ever embarrassed your child: “My family moved to
   a new state when my brother, Stanley, was just starting middle school.
   When my mom dropped him off for his first day of soccer practice, she
   watched him join his team and couldn’t hold back her motherly nerves.
   She rolled down the window of the car and yelled out, ‘Be nice to
   Stanley!!!’ The phrase is now infamous among him and his old soccer
   teammates (his good friends to this day! they were nice!).”

   Says Krysten on burning questions about food: “Something we always do
   is the vegetables-before-dinner plate. While cooking (when my kids’
   whining inevitably sets in), I’ll put out a plate of veggies (sliced
   carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc); if we have fresh fruit, I might
   also cut up an apple or pear. I leave this unannounced on the dinner
   table while I cook. This food is scarfed down almost every time. Before
   dinner. And when we get to dinner and they don’t want to eat their
   asparagus or whatever noxious vegetables I serve them, we move on.
   Because they’ve already eaten veggies. It’s made our dinner time so, so
   much better.”

How One Couple Lives Separately, Together

   By Caroline Donofrio

   One Family's Creative Approach to Living

   For anyone currently in a live-in relationship, have you ever secretly
   wished for a room (or, say, a whole home) of your own? Cup of Jo reader
   Cecilia Latorre and her partner Gerry live in Edmonton, Canada, in two
   homes joined in the middle — a non-traditional arrangement that works
   perfectly for their blended family. “When we first talked about moving
   in together, I’d say in jest, ‘Side-by-side houses, wouldn’t that be
   great?’” says Cecilia. “To which he’d respond, ‘Yeah, but we’re never
   going to find that!’” Until they did…

Five Fun Things

   By Joanna Goddard

   comedy wildlife photography awards

   What has made you smile recently? I’ve been having one of those weeks
   (the inside of my brain is basically this emoji), but the Comedy
   Wildlife Photography Awards are always a pick-me-up. They just
   announced this year’s finalists, including this little chimp straight
   chilling.

   fleabag pins

   Fellow Fleabag fans, have you seen these awesome pins from Etsy? Also,
   mark your calendars: Phoebe Waller-Bridge is hosting Saturday Night
   Live on Saturday, October 5th! Cannot wait to see her bring her magic
   (and also for the inevitable Hot Priest sketch).

   everlane mockneck sweater

   Everlane is killing it with their fall pieces, including this cashmere
   mockneck to wear to work and on weekends, and a cool English-feeling
   mac coat.

   french apple cake

   Apples are arguably the world’s best fruit — so crisp! so sweet! so
   tart! I’d love to ask: do you have any apple recipes you swear by? I’m
   eyeing this French apple cake and caramel apple tart. (This delicate
   apple pie also looks delicious, but doesn’t it seem sort of impossible
   to cut into pieces?)

   go dog go letter

   You know those things you randomly think about every two weeks of your
   adult life? One of mine is this open letter to the female hat-wearing
   dog from Go Dog Go. (“I wanted to take a minute to tell you that what
   matters is that you like your own hat, hat-wearing female dog. Who is
   this guy anyway, some sort of dog hat expert??”) It should be required
   reading for teenage girls (and everyone, really) — and it will also
   just make you laugh.

   P.S. More fun things; plus, Toby’s cravings and how to keep lipstick
   off your wine glass.

   (Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards via Kottke. And thanks to the
   readers who DM-ed the Fleabag pins!)

A 15-Minute Lava Cake for One

   Clementine Chocolate Lava Cake

   One of my favorite places to find solo recipes is Table for One, the
   Food52 column by Eric Kim. So, to conclude our month of cooking for
   one, we’re thrilled to share Eric’s five-ingredient lava cake. “This
   recipe couldn’t be simpler to bake,” says Eric. “And by ‘bake,’ I mean:
   five minutes of stirring together a handful of ingredients, 10 minutes
   of sitting by the oven (and salivating) and 15 seconds of eating (with
   a spoon, in bed).” Here’s how to do it…

   Clementine Chocolate Lava Cake
   By Eric Kim of Food52

   I like to serve these individual chocolate cakes for dessert at the end
   of long dinner parties (everyone loves chocolate). But, more often than
   not, I end up making a batch, baking one ramekin off for myself right
   there, and stashing the rest, covered, in the fridge for the next three
   nights. We spend so much time talking about meal prep, but dessert prep
   can get you a long way.

   Recipe: Clementine Chocolate Lava Cake
   Serves 1 (4 times)

   You’ll need:

   4 oz. dark, bittersweet chocolate (60% or more cacao)
   2 large eggs
   1/2 cup sugar
   1 pinch salt
   1 tsp vanilla extract
   1 clementine, zested
   1/2 cup olive oil
   Powdered sugar, for garnish

   Preheat oven to 400F. Grease four 6-oz. ramekins and place them on a
   sheet pan. Melt chocolate in the microwave and set aside to cool
   slightly. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt,
   vanilla, clementine zest and olive oil until light and fluffy. Fold in
   the chocolate. Pour batter into the ramekins and bake for 10 minutes,
   or until just cooked. The tops should be slightly cracked, the insides
   hot and gooey. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

   Eric Kim

   Thank you, Eric! We love your column.

   P.S. More recipes, including salted caramel brownies and double vanilla
   butter cake.

       oh my goodness, and it’s gluten-free…I’m going to get in trouble
       making this! (and by trouble, I mean none of my pants are going to
       fit because I’m not sharing!)

       My first thought was this looks amazing but it’s not a recipe for
       one, and despite my major sweet tooth I agree with those who say
       this is too much for 4 nights in a row!
       I made half the recipe last night with the intention of eating
       both, and could easily have done so. Luckily my husband saved me
       from myself and stole the second one. I later calculated there are
       520 calories in each one, don’t know why but I was so sure it would
       be lower as there are so few ingredients and no flour!
       Anyway verdict is these are delicious, REALLY easy to make and I
       almost always have all the ingredients on hand. No comparison with
       a mug cake, these are a proper pudding and I would (and will) serve
       them at a dinner party.
       Final point, I left them in a bit longer than 10 mins as I was
       waiting for the tops to crack. They never did so I trusted my gut
       and whipped them out after 12 mins. They were perfect. I would say
       def don’t leave in longer than 10 mins even if tops not cracked.

       This is the type of recipe that seems like it should be possible to
       make spontaneously but I’ve come to realize that chocolate is just
       not a pantry item for me. If there is chocolate in the house, I
       have eaten it. Yesterday. While unpacking the groceries. If I’m in
       the mood for something chocolatey but I don’t want to go to the
       store to get chocolate, I always make Smitten Kitchen’s best cocoa
       brownies. I almost always have all of the ingredients (no chocolate
       required! Just cocoa), I underbake it so they are super fudgy, and
       I just take whatever I don’t eat to work the next day. Or not :)

       This looks lovely, but it’s not a dessert for one which is a shame
       because I thought that was the whole point of the series. I would
       find a genuine recipe for single portions quite helpful. In this
       case, anything is a recipe for one with lots of leftovers…

            This recipe is for a *large* one serving, which send like a
            good idea when we are taking chocolate lava cake. I haven’t
            make it, but sounds like it will turn out yummy.

       Not to be rude, but I feel like COJ has kinda missed the mark with
       a lot of these recent solo dining posts. It’s super misleading to
       say you have a recipe for a lava cake for ONE that actually has
       FOUR servings. What if I don’t want lava cake (super indulgent and
       rich) four nights in a row? (Or like, when you had the roundup of
       solo meals and it included things like popcorn and cereal — cool if
       you just want a break from cooking, but not ideal for single people
       who honestly sometimes are at a loss for what to cook themselves
       because every recipe is 4+ servings.)
       To be clear, the recipe looks delicious. My issue is just 100% with
       the misleading serving size.

            thank you so much, H! we had talked about this beforehand on
            our team, and thought that eric’s approach seemed fun for
            pre-prepping desserts. (so nice to have multiple for the
            week.) but i hear you that it’s great to have a recipe that
            cooks just one serving. we’ll definitely keep this in mind for
            the future. here are a few others that would fit the bill:

            100% agree. As someone who actually cooks for one, I have
            found this column to be totally absurd! They have all been
            standard-sized recipes and some of them (like risotto) don’t
            even reheat particularly well. This recipe looks great but
            there’s no way I’d eat it four nights in a row.

        Genevieve says...
            Personally I agree, as 2 of the recipes were given as “serves
            4” despite the titles it’s not really a column on eating for
            1. I would have thought anyone who regularly cooks for 1 has
            already twigged the concept of dividing a recipe by 4, or of
            meal/dessert planning and eating leftovers. (but then again,
            maybe not, given all the previous comments about people just
            eating cereal haha) Would have been more useful to showcase
            recipes that are actually innovative single-serving recipes
            that don’t leave you with half an egg etc. Oh well.

       Or do a microwave mug brownie.
       1/2 Cup flour, 1/2 Cup sugar (don’t you dare judge me), 2T coco, 2
       T milk, 2T oil, dash of salt, drop or two of vanilla. Stir (a fork
       works great for this) and microwave for about 1 minute (1 minute
       and 10 seconds is perfect for me, but some people like it gooey).

            I was going to use a little Pyrex dish. It doesn’t have the

            need it to stand up. I think you could also use a coffee mug
            or tea cup.

            The ramekin is seriously the most used dish in my house –
            melting butter, prepping for cooking, small dish of ice cream,
            kid snacks, etc. – and they’re usually $2. AND: when I make a
            cake, I put a tiny bit of batter in a ramekin (take out after
            15 minutes or so) so I can taste the finished product without
            anyone noticing :)
            So my advice is to buy a few ramekins. But mugs work, too.

            Jen: Holy Moly, that article! I’m totally choked up after
            reading it. It’s so raw and beautiful and painful and
            loving….and delicious, lol. I feel for both Eric and his
            parents (I have immigrant parents too). Thank you for that
            wonderful read!!
