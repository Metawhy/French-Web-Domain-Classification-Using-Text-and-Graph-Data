Online Art Classes

   Thank you for visiting Paint Basket Online Art Lessons. On the site you
   will find hundreds of online art classes. There are classes in oil
   painting, watercolor painting, acrylic painting, pencil drawing, pastel
   drawing as well as pen & ink drawing. There are even classes in lesser
   known art forms like scratch board drawing.

   It doesn't matter if you are brand new to art or have been an artist
   for years already, we have classes to suit your current ability.

   By clicking the button below you will find over 100 free online art
   classes which you can follow. Most lessons have a text tutorial and a
   narrated time lapse video for you to follow.

   We add new free tutorials every week. If you join our mailing list
   (sign up on any class page), we will send you the occasional round up
   email of new tutorials added to the site.

   (If you prefer to paint or draw along, then you can become a VIP member
   which will give you access to over 400 paint along and draw along art
   classes and courses.)

   Have fun and enjoy the classes.
