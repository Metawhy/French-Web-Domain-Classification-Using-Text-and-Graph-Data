   PmWiki is a wiki-based content management system (CMS) for
   collaborative creation and maintenance of websites.

   PmWiki pages look and act like normal web pages, except they have an
   "Edit" link that makes it easy to modify existing pages and add new
   pages into the website, using basic editing rules. You do not need to
   know or use any HTML or CSS. Page editing can be left open to the
   public or restricted to small groups of authors.

Key PmWiki Features

   Custom look-and-feel: A site administrator can quickly change the
   appearance and functions of a PmWiki site by using different skins and
   HTML templates. If you can't find an appropriate skin already made, you
   can easily modify one or create your own.
   Access control: PmWiki password protection can be applied to an entire
   site, to groups of pages, or to individual pages. Password protection
   controls who can read pages, edit pages, and upload attachments.
   PmWiki's access control system is completely self-contained, but it can
   also work in conjunction with existing password databases, such as
   .htaccess, LDAP servers, and MySQL databases.
   Customization and plugin architecture: One principle of the
   PmWikiPhilosophy is to only include essential features in the core
   engine, but make it easy for administrators to customize and add new
   markup. Hundreds of features are already available by using extensions
   (called "recipes") that are available from the PmWiki Cookbook.

   PmWiki is written in PHP and distributed under the General Public
   License. It is designed to be simple to install, customize, and
   maintain for a variety of applications. This site is running
   pmwiki-2.2.119.

   PmWiki is a registered trademark of Patrick R. Michaud. Since January
   2009 PmWiki is actively maintained by Petko Yotov under the oversight
   of Dr Michaud.

   PmWiki's home on the web is at www.pmwiki.org.
